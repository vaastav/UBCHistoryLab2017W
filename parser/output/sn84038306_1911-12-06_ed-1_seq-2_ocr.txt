In two early cases, where the statute t-]was invoked to enjoin a transportation *,, agreement between interstate railroad tfn companies, it\was held that it was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonal at common law, because it was said athat S the statute was directed against ail contracts and combinations in re straint of trade whether reasonal at common law or not. It was plain from the record however, that the contracts t*complained of in those cases would not have been deemed reasonable at common law. In subsequent cases the court said that the statute should be /given a reasonal construction and re ..fused to include within its inhibition ^certain contractual'•restraints of trade which it dominated as incidental or as indirect.. These cases of restraint of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were instances which, at ^common law, would have been called reasonable. In the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the tests of the com mon law, and in defining exceptions to fonly, \K my •jt the literal application of the statute, substituted for the test of being ^incidental or indirect, that of being treasonable and this, without varying in the slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute.

The Anti-Trust Law—The Supreme ap A Court Decisions. Ji In May last the Supreme court hand £3^ ed down decisions, in the suits in j-ld equity brought by the United States to {enjoin the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri can Tobacco trust, and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch -making and serve to advise the busl !j|ns8B world authoritatively of the scope •and operation of the anti-trust act of •1890. The decisions-do not depart in •any substantial way from the previous •decisions of the court in construing :and applying this important statute, but they clarify those important deci .v„..„sions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal con 1 lt struction of the act. By the decrees, Athey furnish a useful precedent as to '^1,1 the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need and i- wisdom of additional or supplemental' legislation to make it easier for the Jentire business community to square with the rule of action and legality ^•jthus finally established and to preserve '%t the benefit, freedom and spur of rea 'y «sonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. No Change In the Rule of Decision— Merely in Its Form of Expression. 3 The statute in its first section de S?] Clares to be illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or &"otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign nations," $$and in the second, declares guilty of a misdemeanor every person who shall '^monopolize or attempt to monopolize gf||or combine or conspire with any other un person to monopolize any part of the M:trade or commerce of the several $ •-,? Oil Tobacco ¥l 1 jiV ^Kx4 The suggestion is and 7li%WW^j H:?rM/-fy %K' the statute common law distinctions, has emasculated it. This is obviously untrue. By Its judgment every con tract and combination in restraint of Interstate trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition, or of establish ing in whole or in part a monopoly of 6uch trade,-Is condemned by the stat ute. The most extreme critics cannot instance a case that ought to be con demned under the statute which is not brought within Its terms as thus con strued. alBO made that the Supreme court by its decision in thi last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade Is within the terms oft the statute. This is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at common law. is well under stood and is clearly defined. It does not rest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which, in order that it shall be en forceable at all, it must be incidental. If it exceeds the needs of that contract It is void. The test of reasonableness was never applied by the court at com mon-law to contracts or combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose neces sary effect would be to stifle competi tion, to control prices, or establish monopolies.' The courts never as sumed power to say that such con tracts or combinations or conspira cies might be lawful if the parties to them were only moderate in the use of the power thus secured and did not exact from the public, too great and exorbitant prices. It Is true that many theorists, and others en gaged In business violating the statue, have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts but no court of authority has ever at tempted it. Certainly there' is noth ing in the decisions of the latest two cases which should be a dangerous theory of judicial discretion In en forcing this statue can derive the slightest sanction. Force and Effectiveness of Statute a Matter of Growth. We have been twenty-one years making this statue effective for the purposes for which It was enacted. The Knight case was discouraging and seemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, however, the errors of that judgment was corrected, and only in the last three or four years has the heavy hand of the law been laid upon the great illegal combinations that have exercised such an absolute do minion over many of our industries. Criminal prosecutions have been brought and a number are pending, but Juries have felt averse to convict ing for jail sentences, and judges have been most reluctant to Impose such sen tences on men of respectable standing in society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory. Still, as the offense becomes better under stood and the committing of It par takes more of studied and deliberate defiance of the law, we can be confi dent that Juries will convict Individ uals and that jail sentences will be imposed. The Remedy in Equity by Dissolution. In the Standard Oil case the Su preme and circuit courts found the combination, to be a monopoly of the Interstate business of refining, trans porting, and marketing petroleum and its products, effected and maintained through thirty-seven different cor porations, the stock of which was held "by a New Jersey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, directed the transfer and pro-rata distribution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by it in the thirty-seven corporations to and among Its stock holders. and the corporations and in dividual defendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining to re store such monopoly and all agree ments between the subsidiary corpor ations tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined. In the Tobacco case, the court found that the individual defendants, twenty-nine in number, had been en gaged in a successful effort to ac quire complete dominion over the manufacture, sale, and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad, and that this had been done by com binations made with a purpose and effect to stifle competition, control prices, and establish a monopoly, not only in the manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin-foil and licorice used in its manufacture and of its products of cigars, cigarettes, and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the violation of the statute. There was here no single holding company as in the case of the Standard Oil trust. The main company was the American Tobacco company, a manufacturing, selling, and holding company. The plan adopted to destroy the combination and restore competition involved the redivlsion of the capital and plants of the whole trust between some of the companies constituting the trust and new companies organized for the purposes of the decree and made parties to it, and numbering, new and old, fourteen. Situation After Readjustment. The American Tobacco company (old) radjusted capital, $92,000,000 the Liggett and Meyers Tobacco com pany (new) capital, $67,000,000 the P.

The former one tin-foil company^ is dl-! vided into two, one of $825,000 cap ital and the other of $400,000. The one snuff company is divided Into three companies, one with a capital of $15,000,000 another witlk, a' cap ital of $8,000,000 and a third with a capital of $8,000,000. The licorice companies are two, one with a cap ital of $5,758,00 and another with a capital of $2,000,000. There is, also, the BrltlBh-American Tobacco com pany, a British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of $26,000,000, the Porto. Rican Tobac co company with ,«/a capital of $1,800,000, and the Corporation of United Cigar Stores^.' with a capital of $9,000,000. Under this arrange ment each of the different kinds of business will be distributed between two or more companies, with a di vision of the prominent brands in the same tobacco products, so as to make competition not only possible but necessary. Thus the .smoking tobac co business of the country is divided so that the present independent com panies have 21.39 per cent., while the American Tobacco company will have 33.08 per cent., the Liggett and Meyers 20.05 per cent., the Lorillard company 22.82 per cent., and the Reynolds company 2.66 per cent. The stock of the other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, has been taken from the defendant American Tobacco company and has been dis tributed among its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further per formance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies has now been given' vot ing power which was denied it under the old organization. The ratio of the preferred stock to the common was as 78 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change in the character •of the ownership and control of each company. In the original suit there were twen ty-nine defendants who were charged with being the conspirators through whom the illegal combination acquired and exercised Its unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants will hold amounts of stock in the va rious distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent, as a maximum to 28V6 per cent, as a minimum, except in the case of one small company, the Porto Rican Tobacco company, in which they will hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine individual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock except from each other, and the group is thus prevented from extending its control during that pe riod. All parties to the suit, and the new companies who are made parties, are enjoined perpetually from in any way effecting any combination be tween any of the companies in viola tion of the statute by way of resump tion of the old trust Each of the fourteen companies is enjoined from acquiring stock in any of the others. All these companies are enjoined from having common directors or officers, or common buying or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to each other. Size of New Companies. Objection was made by certain in dependent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with very large capital in active business, and that the settle ment that would be effective to put all on an equality would be a division of ttae capital and plant of the trust Into small factions in amount more nearly equal to that of each of the Independ ent companies. This contention re' suits from a misunderstanding of the anti-trust lay and Its purpose. It is not intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of large capital in busi ness enterprises in which such a com bination can Becure reduced cost of production, sale and distribution. It is directed against such an aggrega tion of capital only when its purpose is that of stifling competition, enhanc ing or controlling prices and estab lishing a monopoly. If w4 shall have by the decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units into which the capital and plant have been divided, we shall have accomplished the useful purpose of the statute. Confiscation Not the Purpose of the Statute. It is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by fine or imprisonment of the individual offenders, by flne of the corporation, or by forfeiture of Its goods in transportation, are provided, but the proceeding in equity is a spe cific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital in violation of the statute. Effectiveness of Decree. I venture to say that not In the his tory of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that against the Tobacco trust. As Circuit Judge Noyes said in his judgment ap proving the decree "The extent to which it has been necessary to tear apart this combina tion and force It into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to dem onstrate that the federal anti-trust statute Is a drastic statute which ac complishes effective results which so long as it stands on the statute books must be obeyed, and which cannot be disobeyed without incurring far reaching penalties. And, on the oth er band, the successful reconstruction of this organization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute is not to destroy, but to reconstruct not to demolish but to re-create in ac cordance with the conditions which the congress has declared shall exist Where We,Are Strong. We may be derelict In safeguarding human life, but no people on earth can equal the moral fervor with which we hunt for the responsible man aft er the event.,—New York Evening Post.

Wf among the people of the United States." Common-Stock Ownership,'^- It has been assumed that the pres ent pro-rata and common ownership in all t,hese companies by former stockholders of the trust would insure a continuance of the same old single control of all the companies into which the trust has by decree been disintegrated. This is erroneous and Is based upon the absumed lnefflcacy and lnnocuOusness of Judicial injunc tions. The companies are enjoined from co-operation. or combination they have different managers, direc tors, purchasing and sales agents. If all or any of the numerous stockhold ers, reaching into the thousands, at tempt to secure concerted action: of the companies with a view to the con trol of the market, their number is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed and its prime mov ers and all its participants would be at once subject to contempt proceed ings and imprisonment of a summary character. The immediate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the companies un der different managers, and then com petition must follow, or there will be activity by one company and stag nation by another. Only a short time will inevitably lead to a change ity ownership of the1 stock, as all oppor tunity for continued co-operation mUst disappear. Those critics who speak of this disintegration in the trust as a mere change of garments have not given consideration to the Inevitable working of the decree and understand little the perspnal danger of attempt ing to evade or set at naught the sol emn Injunction- of a court whose ob ject is made plain by the decree and whose inhibitions are set forth with a detail and comprehensiveness unex ampled In the history of equity juris prudence. The effect of these two decisions has led to decrees dissolving the combina tion of manufacturers of electric lamps, a southern wholesale grocers' associa tion, an interlocutory decree against the powder trust with directions by the circuit court compelling dissolu tion, and other combinations of a sim ilar history are now negotiating with the department of justice looking to a disintegration by decree and reorgan ization In accordance with law. It seems possible" to. bring about these re organizations without general business disturbance. Movement for Repeal of the Anti-Trust Law. But now that the anti-trust act is seen to be effective for the accomplish ment of the purpose of Its enactment, we are met by a cry from many differ ent quarters for its repeal. It is said to be obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old-fash ioned methods of destructive competi tion between small units, and to make impossible those useful combinations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that are essential to con tinued prosperity and normal growth. In the recent decisions the Supreme court makes clear that there Is. noth ing in the statute which condemns combinations of -capital or mere big ness of plant organized to secure economy in production and a reduc tion of its cost. It is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the or ganization and maintenance of. the combination or the aggregation of im mense size are the stifling of competi tion, actual and potential, and the en hancing of prices and establishing* a monopoly, that the statute Is violated. Mere size Is no sin against the 'law. The merging of two or more business plants necessarily eliminates competi tion between the units thus combined, but this elimination Is in contravention of the statute only when the combina tion is made for purpose of ending this particular competition in order to se cure control of, and enhance, prices and create a monopoly. Lack of Definiteness in the Statute. The complaint lis made of the statute that it Is not sufficiently definite in its description of that which is forbid den, to enable business men to avoid. Its violation. The suggestion is, that we may have a combination of two corporations, which may run on for years, and that subsequently the attor ney general may conclude that it was a violation of the statute, and that which was supposed by the combiners to be innocent then turns out to be a combination in violation of the stat ute. The answer to this hypothetical case is that when men attempt to amass stupendous capital as will en able them to suppress competition, control prices and establish a monop oly they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having it clearly in mind. If what they do is merely for the purpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of suppressing competition by use of the bigness'of the plant they are creating, then they cannot be convicted at the time the union is made, nor can they be con victed later, unless it happen that later on they conclude to suppress competi tion and take the usual methods for doing so, and thus establish for them selves a monopoly. They can, in such a case, hardly complain if the motive which subsequently Is disclosed Is at tributed by the court to the original combination. New Remedies Suggested. Much Is said of the repeal of this statute and of constructive legislation intended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest mer chants and business men to follow. It may be that such a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discus sions which have been brought out in recent days by the fear of the con tinued execution of the anti-trust law have produced nothing but glittering generalities and have offered no line of distinction or rule of action as A Neat Device.

"My dear man, nobody with a cross, te«tliing baby ever does want the floor any more." definite and as clear as that which the Supreme court Itself lays down in en forcing the statute. Supplemental Legislation Needed—Not Repeal or Amendment. I see no objection—and Indeed I can see decided advantages—in the enact ment of a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition, which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful' purpose denounced in the anti-trust law. The attempt and pur pose to suppress a competitor by un derselling him at a price BO unprofit­ able as to drive him out of business, or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they are required to give up association with other manufacturers, and numerous kindred methods for stifling competi tion and effecting monopoly, should be described with sufficient accuracy in a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the government to shorten its task by prosecuting single misde meanors Instead of an entire con spiracy, and, on the other hand, to serve the purpose of pointing out more in detail to the business com munity what must be avoided. Federal Incorporation Recommended. In a special message to congress on January 7, 1910, I ventured to point out the disturbance to business that would probably attend the disso lution of these offending trusts. I said: "But such an investigation and pos sible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects the. comfort not only of stockholders but of millions of wage earners, em ployes, and associated tradesmen must necessarily tend to disturb the con fidence of the business community, to dry up the now flowing sources of capital from its places of hoarding, and produce a halt in our present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circumstances among the innocence many for the faults of the guilty few. The question which I wish in this message to bring clear ly to the consideration and discus sion of congress is whether, in order to avoid such a possible business danger, something cannot be done by which these business combinations may be offered a means, without great financial disturbance, of changing the character, organization, and extent of their business into one within the lines of the law under federal control and supervision, securing compliance with the anti-trust statute. "Generally, in the Industrial com binations called 'Trusts,' the prin cipal business is the sale of goods in many states and in foreign markets in other words, the interstate and for eign business far exceeds the busi ness done in any one state. This fact will justify the federal govern ment in granting a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell In interstate and foreign com merce the products of useful manu facture under such limitations as will secure a compliance with the anti trust law. It is possible so to frame a statute that while it offers protec tion to a federal company against harmful, vexatious, and unnecessary invasion by the states, It shall sub ject it to reasonable taxation and control by the-states with respect to its purely local business. "Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from ac quiring and holding stock In other corporations (except for special rea-" sons, upon .approval by the proper federal authority), thus avoiding the creation under national auspices of the. holding company with subordinate corporations in different states, which has been such an effective agency in the creation of the great trusts and monopolies. "If the prohibition of the anti-trust act against combinations In restraint of trade Is to be effectively enforced, it is essential that the national gov ernment shall provide for the creation of national! corporations to carry on a legitimate business throughout the United States. The conflicting laws of the different states of the Union with respect to foreign corporations makes it difficult, If hot impossible, for one corporation to comply with their re quirements so as to carry on business in a number of different states." I renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of cor porations to.engage in trade and com merce among the states and with for eign nations. Every argument which was then, advanced for such a law, and every explanation which was at that time offered to possible objec tions, have been confirmed by our ex perience since the enforcement of the anti-trust statute has resulted In the actual dissolution of active com mercial organizations. It is even more manifest now than It was then that the denunciation of conspiracies in restraint of trade should not and does not mean the de nial of organizations large enough to be intrusted with our Interstate and foreign trade. It has been made more clear now than It was then that a purely negative statute like the anti trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the build ing up and regulation of legitimate national and foreign commerce. Government Administrative Experts Needed :to Aid Courts in Trust Dissolutions. The drafting of the decrees in the dissolution of the present trusts, with a view to their reorganization into legitimate corporations, has made. It especially apparent that the courts are not provided with the administra tive machinery to make the neces sary inquiries preparatory to re organization, or to pursue such in quiries, and they should be empow ered to invoke the aid of the bureau of corporations in determining the suitable reorganization of the disin­ Apologetic.

The circuit court and the attorney' general were great ly aided in framing the decree in the tobacco trust dissolution by an ex pert from the bureau of corporations. Federal Corporation Commission Pro posed. I do not set forth in detail the terms and sections of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation per mitting and aiding the formation of combinations of capital into federal corporations. They should be subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure, including effective pub licity, and to the closest supervision as to the issue of stock and bonds by an executive bureau or commission in the department of commerce and labor, to which in tlmeB of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that incorporation under a federal law could not exempt the com pany thus formed and its incorporators and managers from prosecution under the anti-trust law for subsequent ille gal conduct, but the publicity of its procedure and the opportunity for fre quent consultation with the bureau or commission in charge of the incorpora tion as to the legitimate purpose of its transactions would offer it as great se curity against successful prosecutions for violations of the law as would be practical or wise. Such a bureau or commission might well be Invested also with the duty al ready referred to, of aiding courts in the dissolution and recreation of trusts within the law. It should be an execu tive tribunal of the dignity and power of the comptroller of the currency or the Interstate commerce commission, which now exercise supervisory power over Important classes of corporations under federal regulation. The drafting of such a federal Incor poration law would offer ample oppor tunity to prevent many manifest evils in corporate management today, In cluding Irresponsibility of control In the hands of the few who are not the real owners. Incorporation Voluntary. I recommend that the federal char ters thus to be granted shall'be volun tary, at least until experience justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the protection of sucb a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines of the law. Other large combinations that fail to take advantage of the fed eral Incorporation will not have a right to complain if their failure 1s ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transactions to the careful scru tiny, competent supervision and pub licity attendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter. Supplemental Legislation Needed. The opportunity thus suggested for federal Incorporation, it seems to me, is suitable constructive legislation needed to facilitate the squaring of great industrial enterprises to the rule of action laid down, by the anti-trust law. This statute is construed by the Supreme court must continue to be the line of distinction for legiti mate business. It must be enforced, unless we are to banish individualism from all business "and reduce it to one common system of regulation or con trol of prices like that which now pre vails with respect 'to public utilities, and which when applied to all busi ness would be a long step toward state socialism. Importance of the Anti-Trust Act. ,'The anti-trust act Is the expression of the effort of a freedom-loving peo •ple to preserve equality of opportun ity. It is the result of the confident determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by pre serving uncontrolled and unrestricted the enterprise of the individual, his ingenuity, his intelligence and his in dependent courage. For twenty years or more this stat ute has been upon the statute book. All knew of its general purpose and approved. Many of its violators were cynical over Its assumed Impotence. It seemed Impossible of enforce ment. Slowly the mills of the courts ground, and only-gradually did the ma jesty of the law .assert Itself. Many of Its statesmen-authors died before it became a living force, and they and others saw the evil grow which they had hoped to destroy. Now, its effi cacy is seen now its power is heavy now Its object Is near achievement. Now we hear the call for Its repeal on the plea that It interferes with busi ness prosperity, and we are advised in most general terms how, by some other statute and in some other way, the evil we are just stamping out can be cured, if we only abandon this work of twenty years and try another ex periment for another term of years. It is said that the act has not done good. Can this be said in the face of the effect of the Northern Securities decree? That decree was in no way so dras tic or inhlbitive In detail as either the Standard Oil decree or the tobacco de cree but did It not sto$ for all time the then powerful movement toward the control of all the railroads of the country In a single hand? Such a one-man power could not have been a healthful instance in the republic, even though exercised under the general supervision of an inter state commission. Co we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful? When all energies are directed, not toward the reduction of the cost of production for the public benefit by a healthful competition, but toward new ways and means for making perma nent In a few hands the absolute con trol of the conditions and prices pre vailing in the whole field, of Industry, then individual enterprise and effort will be paralyzed and the spirit of commercial freedom will be dead.
