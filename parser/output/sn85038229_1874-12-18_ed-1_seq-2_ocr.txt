PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. PROSTRATION OF BUSINESS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS REVIVAL. To the Senate and House of I2ep- resent a lives: . , Since tie corrverang of Congress one yearago, the nation has undergone a prostrotjaa m busmess and mdustnes,(akled, raca as has not oeen witnessed with us for many years. Speculation as to the for this prostration might be in- in without profit, because as many tlieones would be advanced as there would be writers independent ot "I '-r-- "cwb, those who without borrowing, upon the subject. wiuioiumuuigiiiginuieories as to tne cause of this prostration, therefore, I will call your attention only to the fact and to some questions as to which would seem there should be no disagree- ment Dunngtfcis prostration two es-!ployment elements of prosperity have most abundant-labor and capital JBoth have been largely unemployed. Where has been undoubted capital has been attainable a. very moderate rates. Where labor has been wanted it has been found in abundance at cheap rates com-ito pared with what necessaries and comforts of life could be purchased wath the wages Two great elements of pros- therefore, have not been denied us. A third might be added.

A limited number of Japanese youth might at the same time be educated in our own vernacular, and mutual benefits would result to both governments. The im portance of having our own citizens com petent and familiar with the language of Japan, to act as interpreters and in oth er capacities connected with the legation and consulates in that country, cannot readily be over-estimated. THE MIXED COMMISSION AWARD. the insurrection. It appears equitable that an opportunity should be offered to citizens of other States to present their claims, as well as to those British sub jects whose claims were not admissible under the late commission, to the early decision of some competent tribunal. To this end I recommend the necessary legislation to organize a court to dispose of those claims of aliens, of the nature referred to, in an equitable and satisfac tory manner, and to relieve Congress and tlie departments trom the consideration of the questions. The amount awarded the Government of Great Britain by the mixed commis sion, organized under the provisions of the Treaty of Washington, in the set tlement of the claims of British subjects arising from acts committed between April 18th, 1861, and April 9th, 1865, became payable under the terms of the treaty within the past year, and was paid upon the 21s day of September, 1874. In this connection I renew my recom mendation, made at the opening of the last session of Congress, that a- special court be created to hear and determine all claims of aliens against the United States, arising from acts committed against their persons or property during NEW
