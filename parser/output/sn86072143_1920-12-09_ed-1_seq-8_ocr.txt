Tho program of work which the Chit- 1 tenden County Farm Bureau has out lined for 1921 includes organization in every community in the county where the farmers are willing to back the pro ject; the promotion of better farm man agement through the keeping of exact records; dairy improvement to promote bettcr breeding nnd disease eradication; tho development of a permanent system of soil fertility and efficient handling of crops; the Improvement of the quality of maple products so that they will bring better prices; the promotion of efficiency In household management through home records and home conveniences; educa- tlon along the lines of food preparation for The furm worker and the growing chlld; promotion of sewing clubs giving instruction about how to provide better ;lothing for less money; boys' and girls' clubs to educate the young peoplo in Im- proved farm and homo practices and train them for rural leadership; to do- velop tho best county fair In Northern New England.

President Wilson I evidently looked Into the future when he paid v he had not so much laid before Congress a series of recommendations as he had sought to uttor a confession of faith, of the faith in which he was bred, and "which It Is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day."
