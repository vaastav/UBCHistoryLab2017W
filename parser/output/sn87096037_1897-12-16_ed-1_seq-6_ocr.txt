Grand Forks Herald Dec. 14: Today subpoenas wero issued to the witnesses of the shooting of Ole Halvorson at Inkster by Miss Mary Luxton and 6he will be placed on trial on the charge of murder on Wednesday morning of this week. Half a dozen witnesses havo been called, all of them living at Inkster and being either eyo witnesses of the shoot ing or knowing something of tho trouble which led up to the killing of Mr. Hal verson. Miss Luxton expects to be cleared of the charge and the statement made by Halvorson just boforo his death is said.to favor her more than any of tho testimony given at tho trial. Last Saturday morning in company with Atty. T. J. McMahon, wo drove over to Cooperstown on some legal busi ness, and on our way over we stopped to pay respects to our county commissioner, J. G. Brown, who is very sick. We found him resting about the same as he had been for som^few days, with little if any chango for tho better. He is very weak and is bothered with his lungs. From there our next stop was at Butler and Uptons, whore we found Mr. Butler rustling around doiug the chores and looking after things. Unfortunately Mr. Upton was not at homo, so wo did not get to shako his hand or seo his smiling face. Tho gentlemen havo erectcd, since our last time thero, a very cozy and com fortablo new residence, and no one is more snugly located for the North Da kota winters than they. Arriving in Cooperstown at 1:1:30 cold and hungry, wc at onco made our way to tho palace of all palaces—the Palaco Hotel, under the ablo management of thjt genial princo F. E. Stone, and devoured just a little of Cooperstown's good produce. Thero we met tho old pioneer of Griggs county, Hoa. R. C. Cooper, E. W. Black well. Cashier Buck, of the First Bank of Cooperstown, and many others, whose names at this moment, slip our memory After dinner business matters called our attention, after which the Courier office was looked up, where Editor Trubsliaw was found kneo deop iu business and from all appearancos Percy is keeping that excellent journal well towards tho top of tho ladder. By tho way Mr. Trubshaw is also their new postmaster, and has his two offices in his own build ing—the postoflico in front and his printing office in the rear—of the old Virgo building, noxt door to the Palace Hotel, on main street, a most fitting lo cation for both. Without any doubt, no town in North Dakota of its size, pos esses a better, or more convouient post office than Cooperstown. Its furniture is of hard wood tho very latest, and is so arranged that the public can bo wait ed upon with neatness and dispatch. The good people of Griggs county may well feel proud of their newspaper and postoffice. Of course we did not overlook our old friend Dr. Bergstrom, who en joys a large practico, and who commends the respect of both Griggs and Steele counties, won by his faithful service to all who call him, and his strict attention to business. The doctor is popular every where, and many Hope ptople aro glad to know he is succeeding so well. Johnny Oie, collector and real estate man, whom wo used to know so well, years and years ago, is also enjoying a fine trade as is Wm. Glass, in the same business. Atty. Bartlett looks and feels well, and why not? Atty. Baldwin is kept busy loolt ing after his increasing law, collection and insurance business. Then, thero is that whole souled, good fellow, John McDcrmott, who has sold horse millinery to every farmer in the county for a score of years past—at tho samo old stand. John Syverson, has tho largest and most improved up-to date store, in the state, town considered. He told us his busi ness is good and folks all well. Then there is Peter E. Nelson. Anton Engor, Sheriff Jackson, Rollef Berg. Treasurer Udegard, Auditor Melgard, Messrs. Stovons, Crane, Clark, Cowen, Olson— and scoreB of others, all enjoying life and doing well. Tho general appearance of tho town has improved wonderfully in the past few years. Largo brick blocks churches, hotols, livery barns, school houses, business blocks, tiro department, nice large streets, and numerous other changes and additions for the better, go to make our sister village a beautiful littlo city. Thero is just one thing lack ing—and that is a good base ball team— Eh Percy? But they are all good boys though. Western and Northern Horses Will be closed out at loss than cost.
