The Commissioner has sent out some glowing manifestoes as to probable results, and now, just as he claims to have achieved success, it turns out that one of his agents employed to superintend the experiments has taken out a patent on the vital part of the process which will enable him to appropriate the results of all the government's experiments. The Com missioner Eays he heard nothing about the patent being applied for till ten days after it had been issued. It is a very stupid proceed ing on the part of Government officials. A CORRESPONDENT of the Cincinnati Com mercial Gazette, who has been traveling through middle Tennessee and Alabama, says he found the feeling everywhere strongly against the President's free-trade message. Well-informed Democrats declared the mes sage would make Tennessee as reliably Re publican as Ohio. "On my arrival at Birmingham," says the writer, "1 found every one discussing the message, and the universal rerdict was that the President had certainly destroyed his chances for re-election." There is a large amount of protection feeling in those parts of the South that have begun to feel the impulse of a new development, and the people will think several times before they give their approval to a policy which would mean ruin to Southern industries. Indictments have finally been found gainst seven persons for perpetrating the tally-sheet forgeries in Columbus, O., more than two years ago. Justice has had a long chase in this matter, but seems likely to win In th e end. In some of its main features the Dhio case bears a striking resemblance to the sne in this city. The fraud was done in the same way, by altering the tally-sheets, and was done by Democrats in the interest of Democratic candidates. The gang which planned and executed the frauds have been untiring in their efforts to defeat the investi gation and prevent indictments being found, while, on the other hand, a number of honest Democrats have done all in their power to assist in bringing the rascals to justice. Honest men everywhere .will unite in the hope that both gangs may get their deserts. An independent Democratic city ticket has been nominated in opposition to the machine ticket in Charleston, S. C, and the News and Courier sounds the alarm in a long double leaded editorial. It regards the movement as dishonest and evil, and provocative of the most perilous risks to South Carolina Democ racy, and, in fact, to the entire party in the South. Independentism in any form, it declares, is hostile to the interests of the State and has a tendency to undermine the political citadel. This great ado over what at firsts seems to the Northern mind a little matter, is explained by the drift of further remarks, which show that thi3 little local Split is regarded as a possible, rift within ihe Southern lute, so to speak, which if not mended now may, in time, silence its music, independence will not be tolerated down there. In blind obedience to the party lash alone is Democratic safety and continua nce of "solidity" to be found. TnE trial of the Fidelity Bank case had some sensational features during it3 progress, and rather a dramatic ending. It is unusual in a case of the kind and of such magnitude for the attornej-s on both sides to be willing to submit it to the jury without argument, and yet, in view of the evidence, it is not surprising. The prosecution made a clear case, even without the defendant's own testi mony, which he insisted on giving, against the advice of his attorneys, and which, in spite of his denials of material points, clinched the case against him. The court instructed the jury that even on his own testimony it must find the defendant guilty. Although the indictment contains thirty-three counts 't appears the statute does not authorize a cumulative sentence, and the defendant'3 punishment will be ten-years' imprisonment. The punishment seems light enough in view of the magnitude of the fraud, but perhaps it is sufficient that the law is vindicated, and the warning once more plainly given to na-Monal-bank officers that if they violate the law it is at their imminent peril. THE collapse of the' Henry George move ment, or United Labor party, in New York, removes what many persons thought a year igo likely to prove an important and disturb ng factor in politics. The large vote given Mr. George for Mayor in New York city, and .he rapidity with which he and his followers iffected a State organization, led many to be lieve that the movement would develop formi Jable strength. Mr. George and his co workers undoubtedly thought so, and made very extravagant predictions as to their vote in November. The election resulted in their complete overthrow, practically ending the uovement as a political factor. Mr. George himself virtually admits as much, and now leclares himself opposed to nominating a presidential ticket next year. Instead of this he proposes to try and reform his party on the iariff line and make a deal with one of the other parties. Mr. George is an ultra free trader, and he says: "If one of the parties should take a square position on the tariff question, we should find it judicious to side with that party which favors free trade, and thus we should lend our weight to the ac complishment of one of the elements of our cause." He is further of the opinion that nearly all 'the voters of the United Labor party are free-traders, and could easily be rallied on that line and their support transferred to the party advocating free trade. In other words, Mr. George proposes to enter the field as a dickering politician, with the avowed object of transferring his following to the Democratic party. His great original scheme of abolishing land titles and poverty, which was to revolutionize the -world and usher in the millennium, is to' be shelved, folded up and laid away, and the fine old hobby of free trade is to be made to serve in stead. Personally, Mr. George can probably make more money advocating free trade than he could by making war on land titles, but when it comes to transferring the labor vote to the free-trade Democracy he will probably be worse disappointed than he was in the last r election, nis new scheme will not work any better than the old one. A 

DEMOCRATIC EVICTION. While we are talking of Irish evictions, we have come near having one on a considerable scale nearer home. In 1861 or '62 Mr. Stanton, then Secretary of War, issued an order permitting colored refugees, orfreedmen as they were then called, to settle on the outskirts of the Arlington es tate. This was the property of Gen. R. E. Lee, lying just across the Potomac river from Washington, and when Lee "went South" was confiscated by the government. Most of it is poor, worn-out land of little agricultural value. It has for many years been noted as the site of a soldiers' cemetery, and is now owned by the government. Under Mr. Stanton's order colored refugees began to "squat" on a portion of the estate, and soon a little village sprang up. They were a helpless lot and for quite a while were supported by the military authorities. When the Freedmen's Bureau was established it took charge of them, furnished them lumber to build houses and helped them along in other ways. Those who were able paid for the lumber, and some paid ground rent. The Freedmen's Bureau was long since abolished, and with it govern ment aid of the freedmen's village ceased. Nevertheless, the village continued to grow, in a rambling sort of fashion, until it now contains about 1,000 people. It is a pictur esque jumble of shanties one story or one story and a half high, with little loop-holes of windows and the usual environments of ne gro cottages. In the summer time the little yards are profusely decorated with climbing gourd-vines and with colored children. There is also rather a superfluity of dogs. The in habitants pick up a living as best they can. They are very poor, but they have managed to build a church and school-house, and have a good school. All this is on government land very poor land, it is true, and land for which the government has no particular use, still it is government land. The negroes have been paying rent at the rate of $4 per acre, but that cut no figure in the case. They were there, a sort of fixed fact, and the government permitted them to remain there. A few days ago, how ever, an order was issued for their eviction. This administration had discovered that the negro squatters are there only by sufferance, and decided that they must go. It was dis covered that in the event of a certain real estate scheme succeeding the ground occupied by the colored village could be turned into a government park. This was a remote contingency, but it answered the purpose, and the Secretary of War issued an order for the breaking up of the village and the removal of the negroes, bag and bag gage. This is an inclement season of the year, and theyjj had no place to go to, but they must go. The administration had so de creed, and the. Secretary of War ordered it They could not take their church, their school house nor their cabins with them, but they could take their clothes, their children and their dogs. Perhaps they ought to be thankful that a Democratic administration permitted even that. The spectacle of a colored village being broken up and a thousand people men, wom en and children being turned out of their homes in the dead of winter, under the flimsy pretext that the government might sometime need the gronnd for a park, would indeed be a disgrace to American civilization. The order should have been withheld a few weeks and issued on Christmas. It would have been a fine commentary on the text of good will to men Democratic good will to colored men. The annals of Irish history may be searched invain for an eviction equal to this in whole sale atrocity and diabolical cruelty. Happily, however, the issuance of the order became known before it was put in force, and friends of the colored people began to protest against it Th6 administration saw the signs of an approaching storm, and the order was hastily revoked. They did not dare to enforce it It was the rebel flag case over again. "N.," Louisville. Ky.: The report printed in the Journal was correct. The convicted mule thief was the Democratic candidate. ABOUT PEOPLE AND THINGS. Amelia B. Eiwakds, the novelist, writes "Ph. D. and "LL. D." after her name.

Miss Jarchant, who is in Ireland in behalf of a worc for the assistance of Irish families of the ujjper class who have fallen into poverty through the disturbed state of the country, writes tct England that during the past sixteen months she has had to secure homes for thirty- ! nine children of from two to fourteen years of age, besides relieving many cases of sickness and destitution, and providing many with the means of supporting themselves by needle work. Kcmors remain current in England that Mr. Parnell is suffering from an internal cancer. It is also said that under his assumed name, Pres ton, he frequently visits an eminent physician in Paris. The Providence Journal tells of a little Bos ton girl who propounded two easy ones to her father, as follows: "I want to know how they make condensed milk and how Christ did his miracles." George Vanderbilt, a son of William H., has offered $200,000 for the "Seaman's Retreat' house and grounds, at Stapleton, S. L, with the purpose of presenting it to the county for a court-house and jail. Forty alleged heirs of Jean B. Becquette are about to bring suit for $40,000,000 worth of prop erty in the center of St. Louis. One of their attorneys was formerly employed by Myra Clark Gaines in New Orleans. The wife of President Diaz, of Mexico, has established in tho City of Mexico a large "Friendly Home of the Workingwoman," at which small children will be cared for during the day while their mothers are at work.

The last purchase was that of Senator Hearst, of California, who now controls the San Andres gold mine, quoted at $5,000,000 in the London market. John L. Sullivan now weighs 210 pounds without his clothes. Ho drinks nothing but mineral waters. His only dissipation consists in smoking a large number of cigars, but Eng lish cigars are enough to undermine the strong est constitution. a Miss Skerrett, who used to be Queen Vic toria's private secretary, lately died at the age of ninety-five years. She was an accomplished linguist, and a student so indefatigable that at the time of her death she was studying Icelan dic to be able better to understand the Sagas. Elder Evans, the Shaker leader, is a man of extremely simple tastes. When visiting an artist's studio in New York, recently, he was invited to remain to tea.

Sir August Paget ought to have succeeded Lord Lyons at Paris in right of seniority, but he was passed over be cause Lady Paget is a German, and she would not therefore have been an acceptable embas sadress to France.

Lady Burdett-Coutts denies that she has any intention of visiting America, and adds that she is afraid that a journey to this country would probably be made unpleasant by news paper comments. At a recent wedding the venerable old lady wore a cloak entirely composed of ostrich feathers. Justice Grey is one of the most interesting men on the Supreme Court bench. He is bright at repartee, a good raconteur, and he is a genial host. He is fond of French novels, and is said to read from six to ten of these a week. His singular looking house on the coner of Sixteenth and I streets is rapidly nearing completion. As Justice Grey is a bachelor, Washington gossips are wondering why he has built so pretentious a mansion. The report that he is engaged to Miss Van Vechten, of Albany, is said to be unfounded. General Charles Roome, grand master of the Grand Commandery, Knights Templars, of the United States, has appointed the Rev. Charles H. Hall, D. D., rector of Trinity Church, Brooklyn, N. Y., grand prelate of that body, in the place of the Rev. John W. Webster. Dr. . Hall was born in Augusta, Ga., about sjty years ago. After completing his education he grew to be a popular preacher in the Episco palian Church, being more recently settled as rector of the Church of the Epiphany. Washing ton, D. C. He came to Brooklyn to succeed Bishop Littlejohn as rector of Trinity Church. Dr. Hall is highly spoken of in Masonic circles and his appointment as grand prelate has brought letters of commendation and approval to the grand master from all parts of the United States, especially from the South. Ever since the Crown Prince of Germany was first married he has carried about a small pocket neccessaire, with all sorts of useful things in it. Twenty years ago he won great applause at the state ball given in Turin i n honor of Prince Humbert's wedding. The dress of the Princess of Piedmont caught in the spur of an officer of the lancers; result, a tremendous rent in the sweeping skirt, and a long whisp of gown trailing on the floor. Before the Princess ad time to appeal to one of her ladies-in-waiting, the Crown Prince of Prussia had produced a pretty little morocco etui, from which he extracted a dainty pair of scissors, and kneeling down at the feet of the. bride, skilfully cut away the wreck. After he had effectually relieved the Princess of her incum brance, he rose, bowed profoundly, returned his "case of emergency" to his pocket, and resumed his place at the King's side, amid the subdued murmurs of satisfaction of all the ladies near him. "I hear," says Mr. Labouchere. "that the Queen has written privately to the Emperor William strongly urging that an arrangement should at once be-made to afford a liberal pro provision for the . Crown Princess and her younger children in the event of the deaths of the Emperor and Crown Prince, as if they died now she would be left in very moderate circum stances. The Emperor has vast wealth at his disposal, of which it is supposed nine-tenths will pass to his successor on the Prussian throne, the Gran'' Duchess of Baden getting the rest. It woiuV e easy for his Majesty to make an equitable arrangement in favor of the wife and family of his eldest son, and he cer tainly ought to do so, as it would not be right that they should be left to depend on the liber ality of Prince William. The Crown Prince and the Emperor might die almost simultaneously, and it would be most imprudent to trust to the chance of the former surviving the latter for a sufficient time to enable him to settle his affairs. The Crown Prince can do nothing himself dur ing the Emperor's life." Beginning his eighty-third year, M. Ferdinand de Lesseps can look around, says the London Daily News, and see but very few men of any thing like equal eminence who are as old as he. The German Emperor is 90; Dr. Dollinger is 88; Moltke and Bancroft the historian are each 87; Kossuth is 85, and Professor Owen is 83; but it is not easy to extend the list. Yet it is astonish ing to note the large number of living great men who have passed the ordinary limit of human life. Of sovereigns, the Pope is 77, and King William of the Netherlands is well on in his 7lst year. Of statesmen. Mr. Gladstone is 79, Mr. Bright is 76, Prince Bismarck is 72, M. Jules Grevy is 74, M. Leon Say and M. Leroyer are each 71; Lord Selborne is 75 and Lord Granville is 72. Of generals, McMahon is 79, Leboeuf is 78, and Bazaine and Cialdini are each 76. Of poets, Lord Tennyson is 78, Mr. Browning is 75 and Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes is 78. Of musicians, M. Verdi is 73. Of engineers, Lord Armstrong is 77 and Sir John Hawkshaw is 76. Of painters, Meissonier is 72; and finally, of showmen, Barnum is 77. Perhaps,, however, M. Chevreul, who is fairly started upon his one hundred and second year, ought not be omitted. "The world is growing better every day, And honest men abound," some people say, But still the finest apples of the crop. When packed in barrels, somehow get on top. Boston Courier.

The call issued by the national Republican committee for the national convention to be held in Chicago, June 19, 1888. is perfectly clear upon the main point. It is to be a Republican convention. There Is no doubt about it. Not a convention of free-traders and mugwumps, but a simon-pure, all-wool yard-wide, sure enongh Republican convention. The members of the committee issuing the call know what they are about when it comes to calling a con vention upon a sound Republican basis. That's what they are there for. Chicago Mail. THE

Steuben Republican: "Blot out lo-day the damnable saloons of America, and you would hear no more of anarchism. They are the hot beds where crimes of every hue and dye are born and nourished into strength and activity." a false pretense. Muncie Times: "The howl of the Democratic party for the last few years against 'war taxes' is not meant after all. The internal revenue taxes are the 'war taxes' proper and the Demo cratic administration is opposed to their repeal." they have a good case. Goshen News: "If the Republicans fcannot carry Indiana in 1888, after the occurrences of the last Legislature, Green Smith's usurpation, asylum outrages and tally-sheet forgeries, the State ought to be surrendered to the Anarch ists." OUGHT TO BE PAID. Columbus Republican: "Green Smith is the best representative of the ruling element of bis party in Indiana; from their stand-point of serv ice he is best entitled to the nomination; tbey promised to reward him for his dirty work, and he is right in insisting on his pay." LIKES THE MESSAGE. Elkhart Independent "The President io bis message, has opened the way for a first-class battle between free trade and protection, and if the Republicans are not cowards they will force the conflict It is just what we all want, just at the right time and under just the right kind of auspices." THE 

PARAMOUNT ISSUE. Frankfort Banner: "The Republican party will never succeed until it again takes up the battle of human rights and personal freedom, and clothes every man, regardless of color, in every precinet of the Union, in the livery of all his rights, guaranteed by the Constitution, and more especially those of the war amendments." NOT SO VERY BRAVE. Lafayette Call: "It is not worth while to 'slop over at President Cleveland's 'bravery' in flying in the face of the wool interest. The headquarters of the wool interest is in Ohio, and Ohio is hopelessly Republican, anyway. Mr. Cleveland's 'heroism' will be found to bo regulated with a very keen eye to the election returns." 

MADE A MISTAKE. Terre Haute Express: "Governor Gray seems to have misjudged the fighting strength of the enemy when he Attached the management of the Woman's Reformatory. His unctuous countenance is being scratched and the oily locks of hair on his bead pulled out in a way that surely must make him wish he had tackled a buzz-saw instead." HELLO, GOVERNOR GRAY. Knightstown Banner: "Governor Gray so far lacks the courage of his convictions that he now indorses, or at least, he says he does not con demn the management ot the benevolent insti tutions. It is an old saying that you can't make a silk purse of a sow's ear. No more can you make a wise Governor or a great statesman out of a small, scheming politician. THE DUTY OF REPUBLICANS. Plymouth Republican: "So long as the South ern States continue to send ex-rebel Democrats chosen by force and fraud to the United States Senate, it is the duty of the constitutionally and fairly chosen Remiblicans in that body to fully investigate every case, and to admit no claimant to a seat until it shall be established that no taint of fraud at the ballot-box rests on his claim." KOKOMO GLASS. Kokomo Gazette-Tribune: "The Kokomo glass-works have received numerous inquiries, as well as orders for their glass, from Illinois, Iowa. Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota. Michigan, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Ten nessee and Nebraska. Indiana, of course, leads the van, and this State alone can utilize the product of a dozen glass factories. The trade pronounce Kokomo-made glass fully equal, if not superior, to best imported French window glass. NFXT YEAR. Delphi Journal: "In Indiana local issues are going to figure next fall. They are going to overshadow all other issues. With us the na tional administration is not going to be on trial so much as the administration of the affairs of the State. The people of Indiana have been brought to realize, during the last year, that it is our own particular dooryard that must be cleaned. In fact, tbey recognize that a mere sweeping and dusting will not do, bnt that soap and suds and disinfectants must needs be ap plied in order that the stench, the foulness and disease be driven away." Compliments to Mr. Turpie. Terre Haute Express: "Will some one please repeat Charles Francis Adams's remark as to fraud and apply it to David Turpie? It is writ ten ail over his brow." Logansport Journal: "Turpie may retain his place on technical grounds, but if he does he will only be an awful example or the power of usur pation and scheming partisan crime." Delphi Journal: "Mr. Turpie is a fraud and a pretender. He sits in the Senate a monument to bribery, theft and every other crime that has been committed against the ballot-box." North Vernon Plain Dealer: "Mr. Turpie, of Indiana, has no business with a seat in the United States Senate. He represents riotous ruffianism and flagrant fraud, not a great State." Lafayette News: "The people of Indiana look to the Senate of the United States to right the great wrong perpetrated upon them last winter. There has already been too much giving away of rights too much pusillanimity.' Rensselaer Republican: "Turpie holds the office of Senator by virtue, first, of an infamous Gerrymander, and then by the fraudulent un seating of a Republican in the State Senate and replacing him by a Democrat, who had no shad ow of right to the seat" Lafayette Courier "The admission of Hon. David Turpie to a seat in the United States Sen ate without protest was a mistake for whicb the Republican members of that body are wholly re sponsible, and their sudden freak of generosity will return to torment them." Kokomo Gazette-Tribune: "The whole con spiracy, beginning with the gerrymander and ending with the alleged choiee of Turpie, is an outrage unutterable. The successful culmina tion of the theft, if it shall so happen, will be a calamity to popular government." Anderson Herald: "Indiana's disgrace will be well advertised by the presence of a fraudulent Senator, who owes his election to the physical strength ot a gang of Democratic hoodlums. I who, under the leadership of usurper . Green ' Smith, seized upon the legislative machinery of the State for th purpose of perpetrating one of the greatest outrages possible against a free peo ple." Wabash Plain Dealer: "The seating of Tur pie may, after all, be a blessing in disguise. It will arouse the Republicans of Indiana to an ap preciation of the desperate game their political opponents are playing for party supremacy." Rushville Republican: "The least the Senate can in justice do. is to declare that there was no election. For Turpie was not elected under any law or any Constitution of Indiana; and, it suf fered to sit, will represent only Democratic ring rascality and his own shamelessness." Hendricks County Republican: "The seatings of Judge Turpie in the United States Senate last Monday was in the nature of a travesty on this Republic. Turpie was a virulent copperhead in war times, and his election last year was the re sult of a compromise with usurpers and scoun drels." - Princeton Clarion: "There is no doubt that his election was illsgal, and there will be abund ant evidence presented to the committee to show this fact but judging by their action in the Payne case, wo see no reason to believe that the Senate will pay any attention to such irregularities." Connersville Times: "If Turpie is allowed to retain a seat in the United States Senate.it will be by virtue of the infamous compromisa made by some of the Republican members of the I Legislature with the Democrats, in which they recognize the illegal Democratic pretended members of that body." Union City Eagle: "We believe Turpie not lawfully entitled to his seat, but he has received it by virtue of the compromise and bythe ad missions of that instrument will doubtless hold it. The appeal must now be to the peopie, where th merits of the case can be fully dis cuesed, stripped of all technical defenses." Fort Wayne Gazette: "As far as sentiment is concerned in Indiana the Democratic party has suffered an injury by the seating of Mr. Turpie. It adds another " to the long list of wrongs resultant from the revolutionary prac tices of the Democratic party of the Legislature, and strengthens the hands of the Republicans in this State." Colombia City Commercial: "If ever a man was 'boosted' into place through corruption and fraud that man is David Turpie. He has no more legal right to the seat be occupies than had Green Smith to the seat he and his party stole by brute force from Lieutenant-governor Robertson last winter. No honorable man could enjoy such stolen f rut. " Peru Republican: "Mr. Turpie's election, as all remember, was compassed by unseating a member of the Indiana Senate who was elected by 600 majority, and seating the man who had been defeated at the polls by that number of votes. Such an outrage bad never before been attempted in a Northern State. If he secures his seat by such methods, elections will hereaf ter be nothing but farces, and Southern frauds will become the effective methods of disfranchis ing the people." The Demoralized Postal Service. Mishawaka Enterprise: "What is the mat ter with the postal clerks lately! About two thirds of the mail matter which comes to the Enterprise office lately from a distance is marked 'missent.' Subscribers too, are com plaining constantly because they do not receive their papers regularly or promptly. Reform is necessary in this branch of the service." Richmond Register: "Complaints are coming to this office almost every day that subscribers at their postoffices do not receive their papers. In order to assure themselves that the fault is not with them, the proprietors have bad the mail list checked off. after it was written, and have found no mistakes. This throws the blame on the postal service, and illustrates the need of civil-service reform. Green postal clerks, put in by party preference, cannot be expected to do good work, and papers are the first thing slight ed. The failures so far reported come more fre quently from the Cincinnati line. There is need of some improvement in that branch of the postal service." Terre Haute Express: 'The railway mail service is steadily growing more inefficient The Rockville papers this week tell of instances of inexcusable delay, and in this city nearly every one has had a vexatious experience. A letter mailed at Clay City, on the Evansville & In dianapolis road, was three days in getting here, and of the Indianapolis & St. Louis road , there are frequent complaints. The postal clerks on the morning west-bound train on tho Vandalia road fail to supply the subscribers of the In dianapolis .newspapers with their papers abont three days in the week. The morning Journal, within the past ten days, three times has been twenty-four hours late. The thing is getting to be intolerable." Candidates, State and .National. Lawrenceburg Press: "It may be Hrrison and Phelps. And it is just as well to say that there are few abler and no better men than William Walter Phelps, of New Jersey." Clay County Enterprise: "The Franklin Banner is for Harrison, Hawley and Harmony. Why not end the alliteration with Hurrah, acd'give the Democracy H with the combina tion." Rushville Republican: "Indiana Republicans want a candidate for Governor who combines personal character, popularity with the people, large experience, undoubted qualifications for the position, and ability to carry the State. His name is Albert G. Porter." Winchester Herald: "General Ben Harrison is daily growing stronger in the estimation of all conservative-thinking people. He has a power ful intellect and a comprehensive mind, is one of our) most spotless men. and has never stooped to and will never recognize any dema gogidtn whatever. Ae a clean, upright honest, conscientious and able statesman, he has few equals in our country." PLANS OF THE MOBMOXS. One of Their Bishop Says Utah Will Be Ad mitted by the Democrats. Cleveland Special. Bishop James McKnight, of the polygamous Mormon Church, has hovered about this vicinity for some weeks past, and is apparently doing his best to proselyte for his faith. To a reporter the Bishop revealed some remarkably interest ing points about his church. "It is 6aid in the newspapers," the reporter be gan, "that a bargain has been made by your people with the Democratic party by which Utah is to be made a State as soon as possible, and in consideration thereof the State is pledged to be permanently Democratic Is that sol" "We Mormons put our church above every thing else in this world. What do we care for political parties when a point of permanent im portance can be gained for our church? To-day we are in a crippled condition because we are simply a Territory or province of a hostile gov ernment. There is nothing in our sacred creed that is higher than polygamy. It is not simply a permission to take more than one wife, as many people seem to imagine; it is a command from God. It is absolutely incumbent upon every man who is able to support them to take as many wives as he can provide for. The man who does his duty faitafully as a Mormon will be on an equality with God and His Son Jesus Christ in the world to come. He will be above the angels, who are simply ministers or servants. Some of the Democrats have been angry at me because I said that there is a bargain between that party and the Mormon Church. I did not intend to have any each thing published. But it has been published, and, as I love truth, I cannot deny it. Besides, I see no barm in having it known. There is nothing morally wrong in it. On the other hand, such bargains are made constantly by politicians and no ore thinks anything of it. Why should not the Mormon leaders who are now hunted and persecuted for their holy religion do what they can to protect themselves and better their condition?" "What will, in your opinion, be the future of the Mormon Church?" "It will spread abroad until it takes posses sion of the whole world. It is the word of the living God, aud cannot fail. The 'Church of God of Latter-day Saints' is the stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands, which is spoken of in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, which shall break in pieces the kingdoms of the earth. There is no possible question of this, for the Lord has 6aid it, and has confirmed it over and over again. It will be a moral revolu tion. We shall not take up arms as the Moham medans did. But our doctrines are from above, and must prevail." , "But how do you expect to reach the nations and break them in nieces." "All that is certain to come in God's own good time. We follow the injunctions of God. Our m issionaries go into all lands. As soon as a per son is baptized we expect him to eome out from his peopie and his kindred and to start for Utah immediately." "How many are thus brought into this coun try annually' "About 6,000. " "Where do they come from mostly?" "From the Scandinavian countries, perhaps, more than anywhere else, although they come to os from everywhere." "Do you not fear that the immigration may be stopped by the government?" "It eannot be stopped unless all immigration is stopped. How shall it be ascertained that a man who comes here is a Mormon? There is nothing to show that be belongs to that church any more than that he belongs to any other." "Are the emigrants looked after on their ar rival in Salt Lake City?" "Certainly, they are. It is only a short time -till ihey have a piece of land, a cow, and a nice house. Tbey are infinitely better off than they could ever have boped to be in their native land, and they justly attribute it all to the Mormon Church, which has called them out from their old-world eurroundines. Tnere are now more than 170.000 Mormons in Utah, and 40.000 or 50,000 in the surrounding Territories. We shall eventually control all that region. "Is the Edmunds law anything of a hindrance) to yonr cause?" "O not much. We have to conceal our plu rality of wives, that is all. Before that law -was enacted we lived openly with our wives, now w have to resort to subterfuge, or be arrested. Of eourse this is very humiliating, and many Of onr better men have gone to prison a second time rather than make anv concealment of their plurality of wives." "What would be the principal advantage la Mormons of having a State government?" "Much every way. We would the n elect our own officers, have our own courts, ete." "But the Edmunds law is a United States statute, is it not. and offenses under it would have to be tried in the United States courts, would they not?" "Yes, I suppose so; but if we had our own State government we would have much better protection of our sacred rights than we can ever get as a Territory. The time is bound to come soon when we shall be a State. Our population is entirely sufficient already, and that we are kept out of the Union is simply a piece of perse cution for religion's sake." THE PLACE OP MEETING. Belief tli at Chicago Was CIiomd with Blaine domination in View. Philadelphia Press. ' - The events of this week Cleveland's remark able message, Blaine's instant and powerful answer, and the plain pointer of the national committee have shaped the campaign of 1888. Many men would have waited and watched, but history would not wait for them. On Mondpr the elements were in solution; on Thursday they bad crystallized. The outcome of the national committee only confirmed what the deliverances cf Cleveland and Blaine had already determined. The action ot the committee signified nothing; the tone and temper of the committee signified much. Nt for years in its councils has there been so little jarring and so great unanimity of feeling. Tbe committee fairly reflected the general sentiment of the party, and it is not too much to say that it looked forward to one result. Its guiding motive was to surround that clearly anticipated result with the best conditions and to bring it to its consummation under the most favorable circumstances. In the contest for the place of the convention, which was condncted with the utmost good feel ing throughout, Philadelphia bad at one tim! a clear majority and was on the point of being chosen. There were eight or nine votes for Philadelphia on its own merits; there were fifteen or sixteen others that without regard to personal preferences, were ready to be east for Philadelphia if this were deemed the best policy. For a time this view prevailed. There - was great potency in the plea that in no other wr y could the gauntlet thrown down by Clevelan I be so promptly and unmistakably picked u. He bad challenged the country and the Republic an party to an issue on protection, and how could the high purpose of the party to accent the challenge be so clearly shown as by going with the convention to the recognized bead quarters of protection? But to this it was an swered that if Mr. Blaine was to be nominated it was better polities that it should come from some place more nearly like neutral erour.d, and this view was so strenuously urged by some of the representatives of the Northwest that it was finally accepted, and when the determina tion was made there was cordial acquiescence) in it. Mr. Blaine as a Candidate. Marat Halntead's New York Letter. Mr. Blaine's Paris interview is a remarkable illustration of the extent of the telegraphic facil ities in bringing into familiar communication the remote places of the earth. One in Paris is in touch with events at Washington as closely as if he were this side the Atlantic; that is, when the magician of the cables is summoned. Certainly the Blaine interview sounds like & proclamation. It is wonderfully clear and strong, exact and striking, and especially marked with the characteristics of the author's style and convictions and methods of presenting his views. There is the sound of the trumpet in this manifesto, and yet it may not mean at all what the average politician will naturally insist is perfectly obvious and conclusively es tablished. It may sot mean that Mr. Blaine bas made up bis mind to run for the Psesidency, but just the other thing. Mr. Blaine's disinclination to be the candidate in 18S3 has been known to increase rather than decrease since he has been in Europe. Those who know him best have the strongest possible assurances of his sincerity, and kuow that be is deterred from absolutely declining only by his sense of obligation both to friends and to ene mies. The President's message and Mr. Blaine's reply are two remarkable documents, and they are likely to be widely influential. The position of Mr. Blaine is one of im mense potentiality and reppoueibiiitv. and as the case stands he could make his bow and turn his back upon the presidency in better form after the blast of the trumpet from Paris than before. He certainly would do so if there were assurances that there could be found a man stronger before the people in the critical States. He eertainly will do so if not called to go to the front again by such manifestations of Republic an public opinion as are practically unanimous at least so dominant as to be unanswerable and unavoidable. That Mr. Blaine has, under the pressure of the sense of responsibility resting noon him, made tentative inquiries touching possible presi dential candidates who might hsal all differences and summon all Republicans into one grand army, is confidently asserted upon high 'authori ty, and it may be stated upon the same authority that nothing that removes doubts has been as certaired. Air. Blaine's special friends, who have been for him twelve years, and have had the majority of delegates with Republican con stituenceies in three successive national conven tions, are watching and waiting for a word from him. but tbey do not get it, and his coldness and reserve they find disappointing. If the nomination goes, or would go to Mr. Blaine again, it would be, to secure his accept ance, the expression not merely of those who have been for him heretofore, but reinforced by those who have boon against him. Mr. Blaine could get the nomination, but he-could not af ford to do it in ways involving a suspicion of seeking and strategy. Something approaching spontaneity and unanimity are requisite to suit the demands, aud no one is so sensitively alive to this state of the case as Mr. Blaine himself. ii A Good Point ia His Favor. St. Louis Globe-Democrat. Gen. Ben. Harrison, of Indiana, resigned a good office at the beginning of the war and en listed as a private in the Union army; and his friends are quite right io claiming that this fact is a strong point in his favor as a candidate for President against a man who kept out of the army on purpose to hold an office. Journalistic Anomalies. . Cbicazo Journal. The Republican free-trade newspapers in the United States number two, of which one is published in Chicago, and is the most enthusi astic supporter of Mr. Blaine for the presidency. The other is published at St. PauL A Blaine free-trade Republican newspaper would appear to be an impossibility, but it exists. The Chicago Convention. Philadelphia Press. The result will do a great deal to make Chi cago substantially a permanent place of meet ing for political national conventions.' and it is not improbable that Democrats will now follow the Republicans, as they did four years ago. George's Error. Boston Journal. - Mr. Henry George is of the opinion that "republican government is breaking down ia the United States," but the probability is that Mr. George has confounded republican govern ment with the United Labor party. The First Frost. Philadelphia Chronicle. Virginia is the first Demoeratie State to pnt itself on record against the President's policy on the tariff by adopting resolutions demanding the repeal of the internal revenue taxes. This is merely the beginning. What He Is There For. Detroit Tribune. Under the title of Postmaster-general Don Ml Dickinson will now put io his best licks for Cleveland and more "vittles" for the Democratio party. Why, of Coarse. Philadelphia Time. Mr. Blame, it must be observed, is ouite out of politics. His remarks on the President's mes sage are to be regarded as strictly non-partisan. Why It Was Short. Philadelphia Press. The President's message would have been longer if the wool had held out. He Appears to Be. Philadelphia Inquirer. There is a minor in political circles to the ef fect that Mr. Blaine is "well"
