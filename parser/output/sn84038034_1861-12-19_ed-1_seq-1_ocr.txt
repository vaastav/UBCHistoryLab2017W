Our would-be leaders of opinion are careful not to be biased by any acquaintance with the facts, tbey are ideal ists of the first tvut.-r, and as deductive as Mr. Buckle's Scotchmen. We propose in a series of papers to ex amine this matter by the light of history, that we may learn what experience really teaches. .egro Slavery is older than the dtseo-1 eryor America, mougn us rapm gr 1 M a .a a r i a. S is connected with the settlement ot lue new continent. Spain and Portugal were the first nitions of Europe to engage in tho slave trade, and the Spanish colonies in America first saw th experiment of negro slavciy tried on a large scale, iliflpanio la, the present llayti, was the first land to behold Emancipation, as it had been the earliest to endure the unhappy experiment. In 179o, the slaves of the French portion of the Lland, half a million in Dumber, were set free by order of the French com missioners, Sonthonax and Polverel. What was the eane, and what the conse aneqtoe of thi act? The French Rerolntion, beginning in 17, ha 1 l.aki'n the so.-inl system of the French colonics ts well as- of all the nation of Europe. Tlie white planters quarreled, some siding with the king, some with the republic. The mnlattoe.. numerous and wealthy, had claimed and received privi- leges fromtheNation.il Assembly which the haughty whites would not concede; hence arose, civil war between the mnlat- toes and whites. At first tho antra. thorgh so numerous an I so cruelly treated, took no part. But the emissaries of the Count 1'Artois and the Spaniards, aided by the invincible love of free lorn in every breast, at last branfcfct the insurrection of 1791. Thonan It of whites, and tens of thousands of blacks were slain, but -ener- 1 al emancipation did not take place.

Urder Dto 3 was, in my mind, merely a military necessity. Unauthorised persons, black or white, free or slave, must be kept out of our caraps, unless we are willing to publish to the enemy everything we do or intend to do. It was a military and not a I ' 1 . 4 - av political order. I am ready to carry out any lawful in strucijone in regard to fugitive lave which my snperiors may gTre me, and to enforce any law which Congress may put; but I cannot make law. aod will not rio- 1st it. l on know my private opinion on the policy of confiscating the slave proper- ty of rebels in arms. If Congress shall pass it, you nmy be certain that I shall e- force it. Perhaps my policy as to tho lreÄtmfnt of rebels a their property is as well set out in order No. 13 issnel the day before your letter was written, as I could now describe it. Yours tialy, n. W. Hau.eck. Mr. Lovejov. of Illinois rrnliftJ ami tm conclusion said: "If any soldiers want to htftit siroply for the ournose of returninr fngitivo slaves. h had only to remark that the army would be stronger without them." Mr. Bi. air, of Mo., from the Committee on Military Affair, reporicd a bill author izing the raising of a volunteer force for the better defence of Kentucky. Mr. Wickuffe, of Ivy., who. several days ago, introduced the bill, proceeded to show the importance of pacing it. Ken tucky, be said, was tu be the great battlo ground of the war. The people of that State honed soon to snn th ,liu Imn lux invader's foot would be expelled from their territory, which is now invaded. Proper ty has been ruthlessly destroyed or carried oti', homesteads have been mule deaolate, bridges burned, & : , and it is to protect tho State, while the army is marched elscwhore, that the roltinteer force ia reqnired. Mr. Wicklifte also said he had received from the Military Board of Kentucky an urgent application to call cn the War De partment, and ask for just snch a corps aa the bill provided. He had bronght tho subject to the attention of the President and SHrretary of War, and it met not only withtheir approval, but of all theCabioet. Mr. Maynabd, of Tenn., spoke of a re cent sojourn in the part of Kentucky so much ravaged and laid waste by the rebel troops, and would allnde at a future time to the distressing condition of affairs in Eastern Tennessee, which he said he aloao had the honor to represent. His people, he said, had been left mnro- tectod by the Government, notwithstand ing their firm devotion to tho Union. Ho hebl it to be a duty not only to protect loyal men in Tennessee and Kentucky, but in South Carolina and every wliere, as much so as in Pennsylvania and the ad joining States. 1 nrther consideration of the bill waa postponed till Monday. The House proceeded to the considera tion of the special orders, namely: The various propositions involving the question of emancipating the persons held as slaves by rebels. 

SENATE. Mr.TnuMCLLLof III., presented a petition to repeal thc law which pieea Jrih diaM4 fiuui officiating as Chaplains in the army. Mr. Wilcox, of Mass., offered a resolu tion that tho Inspector General, Quarter master General, and Commissary General of Subsistence, be directed to inform tho Senate what articles ought to be sold by the sutlers to volunteers, and such as best would secure their efficiency. He believed the whole system suouid be promptly abolished. Thc resolution was agreed to. The joint resolution from the House, expressing the feelings of Congress, in re gard to the gallant conduct of the late Gen. Lyon, was referred to thc Military Com mittee. Mr. Footk, of Vt.. called up the resolu tion to expel Waldo P. Johnson, Senator from Missouri, from the Senate. The Clerk rca 1 an cxtact from the se cession speech of Senator Johnson, deliv erel in Missouri. The resolution was re ferred. Thc bill to promote the efficiency of tho N'avy, reported by Mr. Grimes of Iowa, from the Naval Committee, was taken up. On motion of Mr. Doouttle of Wis consin, the lime of retiring was made 45 instead of 40 ycarg. After fuither discussion the bill was passed. Mr. Joiixsox, of Tenn., moved that so much of tho President's Message as refera to a railroad to Western Kentucky and Tennessee, be relerred to a select commit tee. The motion was agreed to. The Senate went into Executive Session, and upon thc opening of the doors, ad journed until Monday.
