This mixed fluctuation la expected) to last until the bases of business ehall have reached a more table position. Meantime, the stock liflt aa a whole may remain in a trad ing ranee near present prices, await ing changes in the tAg trades. Money conditions after the turn of : the year are expected to display Im provement. By that time some of the large pending government transac tions will have been concluded, the Interior return of funds to New Tork ; will have been -passed, and the eni i of-year disbursements will have taken ; piece. Release of funds is taking 1 Dlace with the disposition of lnvento- , rles In the tendency toward getting 1 business In general on a sounder basis I for reconstruction work. Investment funds are therefore naturally accu mulating In ironey circles, and may J be expected to seek employment ii the Stock Exchange market. ! Professional operators largely con trol the superficial fluctuations of the ! stock market at present, but they are j fcetween two fires, namely, the bank Ing element will not countenance a i broad rise on account of present i money strain, and, on the other hand tne steady investment arcsorpuon iw.

Oiptimism Is expressed toy the Na tional City Bank of New York in its latest circular on financial conditions saying that business readjustment should not cause alarm. "It 1 not possible," it says, "to doubt that a ; great period of prosperity awalt3 the country as soon ae the readjustments to a peace basis are made, and In our are not cuch as to occasion alarm. The situation Is inherently strong. Stocks of goods of all kinds are low all over the world, and people have been economizing In purchases until their needs are pressing.

Ger fmany, the greatest steel exiporter Be fore the war, has exported none Hor four years. Belgium and France, also exporter of steel, have sold none in the some time, and England's sales tiave been greatly reduced. These ar rearages naturally must ibe made up. The demands of Europe - upon the - European supply will e so great that the other markets will have to look largely to the United States for early attention. IPu'rthermore, this coun try's capacity to absorb Iron and steel is very great, and there is unques tionably a heavy domestic demand in waiting."

Ryan, who had charge of the IJnittd States aircraft division, has 4Jreturn to the business world. He Vfva.8 elected chairman of the BoarK r,t the Anacondn, Copper Co. and also , president of the United Metals Sell Ling Co. His splendid record in the "War Department, following that in the j dipper trade prior thereto, may foe de pended upon to be duplicated in his latest responsible positions. Uhe cop per Industry welcomes back his wide experience and progressive policies In a 'belief that the reconstruction of that trade will be rapid'. The Nation turns Its eyes upon the Peace Congress in Prance, to which the President has gone In person. His Message to Con-gress, Indicating that the Administration would not advo cate Government ownership for the railroads, Is favorably received in in vestment circles. It Is exipected that fairer treatment will be accorded the transportation systems when they are returned to private ownership, and that the outcome, while entailing broader Federal control, will be ben eficial to security holders aa well as nippers. It would seem tat the fu ture is (brighter for the raitroaiilB than (or many yeans past, and we believe tacks of leading companies whose arnlng provide sulbstantlal margins ver dividend requirements, offer at tractive tmylng opportunities on mar ket declines, The spirit of service that enabled par country and Its Allies to win the rae is certain to be operative in solv ing the problems of peace, Including those vital issues between cepital and labor. It Is reported that large re COet miction orders for account of Wanes and Belgium are already be ing negotiated! through Washington. This is a forerunner of what may be xxieoted. If leading commercial Na tions will observe the natural laws of ntpply and demand in readjustment period a great period of prosperity Is oonsidered almost certain afterward. The belief seems to be quite general that the business readjustment In the United States will take from three to our. months. It should (be remain bered that the stock market begins to discount broad developments of this character some time in adlvance.
