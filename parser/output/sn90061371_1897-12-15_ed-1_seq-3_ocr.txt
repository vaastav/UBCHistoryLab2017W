THE STRUGGLE ENDED. Mother McKinley Has Gone to Her Loner Home. Died Surrounded by Her Children -She Coca to Her Gist Honored and Mourned by AU the People of the United States Sketch of Her Ufe. Cahtox, 0., Dec 13. Mrs. McKinley passed from life at a few minutes past two o'clock yesterday morning, with 11 her children and other immediate rela tires at her bedside. She did not offer any in her last hours but grad ually passed from the deep, palsied sleep in which she has rested almost constantly for the past ten days into the sleep of death. No word could be secured from the house for some hours before the disso lution. Knocks of reporters as well as those of telegraph messengers were unanswered. At 2:H5 an undertaker was sum moned and the first publicity given to the death. The end was most beautiful in its quiet and peacefulness. She seemed to sleep so soundly that it was difficult to tell whether she had yet breathed her last. This condition lasted foi THE LATE NANCY ALLISOX M'KINLEY. half an hour. There was no struggle. She seemed to sleep her life away. The president and all of her family were by her side. There were no rec ognitions, however. Her last con sciousness was hours before her final taking away. At 3:30 a. m. the family, worn out, with long watching, retired for the first rest in the McKinley house for ten long days and nights. The presi dent's wife stood the strain better than it was feared she might. The family in their long vigils have all seemed to have the great strength of the mother, whose vitality at nearly 90 surpassed the expectations of the doctors and de layed the end for ten days that was expected in a few hours. Sketch of the Life of Slot her McKinley. Mrs. McKinley was distinctively a home-loving woman, anil the two-story frame cottage on WestTuscar iwas stroet in this city, where she died and where she had lived for many years, was dearer to her than any other spot on earth. There she spent her declining d.iys with her daughter Helen and her grandchil dren Orace and James McKinley, receiving oc casional visits from her other children, seldom going out except to church, where sho could be found every Sunday morning unless pre vented by illness. While showing deep affection for her other children she had followed the career of Wil liam with pride and solicitude. With fond, motherly admiration she watched him rise from the position of prosecuting attorney of his own county, by successive stages to con gressman, governor and finally to tho preii dency. During the memorable campaign of last year for the nomination and nftcrwar.is for tho election, Mrs. McKinley was one of the most interested observers. Sho was always given the place of honor at the home of her illustrious son, and on the day of his nomination by the St. Louis convention she heard the news as soon as'he did. It was then that William McKinley showed the deep love he bore for his mother by kissing her as guon as he had received the announcment of the re sult at St. Louis. All through the trying cam paign that followed, she watched after her son with deep interest. She was a frequent caller at his house and was greeted by many visiting delegations of republicans. Mother McKinley accompanied tho president to the Inauguration, riding in a special train, and remained in Washington until Mr. aud Mrs. McKinley had become settled in their new home. Then she returned to the Canton cot tage with expressions of gratitude at getting borne once more. Nancy Allison McKinley came of a family which as transplanted from England to the hills of Virginia. The Allison family subse quently removed to Ureen county, Pa., where Abner Allison, Nancy's father, was born and where he married Ann Campbell, of Scotch German descent. Early in the present century, Mr. and Mrs. Allison came from Pennsylvania to Columbia county, this state, traveling by pack horses. In 1S09. near the present city of Lisbon, Nancy Allison was born. Her girlhood was passed on the farm, and In 18:7 she married William McKinley. a young iron manufacturer. The couple lived first at Fairtteld and after ward at Niles and Uolnnd before moving to Canton. Nine children were born to them. They were David Allison, deceased; Anna, deceased; James, diceased; Mary, deceased; Helen Minerva, now living at Canton; Sarah Eliza beth, now the wife of Mr. A. J. Duncan, of Cleveland; William, the president; Abigail Cella. deceased, and Abner, whose home Is la New York. William McKinley, Sr., died in Novcmbei UW2, at the age of 86 years.

The President Remains Firm o the Gold Standard. That part of the president's mes sage which deals with the currency problem is a clear presentation of our present financial condition, a plain statement of the dangers and embar rassments under which the nation's treasury now labors, and a strong ar gument in favor of reform in our monetary laws. Perhaps the feature of this part of the message which will be received with greatest approval by the commer cial and financial world is the presi dent's unequivocal, positive and reiter ated declaration that this is a gold standard nation, that all our money must be maintained at a par with gold, and that it will be so maintained under all circumstances. After reviewing the history of our monetary legislation since the war he takes up the existing situation, and says: "The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the govern ment of maintaining the parity of our different forms of money; that is, keeping all of them at par with gold." And again he says: "We have $900,000, 000 of currency which the government by solemn enactment has undertaken to keep at par with gold." And still again he declares: "The government, without any fixed gold revenue, is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it- has 6teadily and faithfully done, and which under the authority now given it will continue to do." After showing the lack of wisdom, the folly, of selling bonds, and thereby adding to our interest-bearing debt for the purpose of redeeming over and over again a noninterest-bearing debt in the shape of United States notes, the president makes the proposal here tofore predicted in these columns. He urges that when United States notes are redeemed by the government in gold they should be set apart, and only paid out, if at all, in exchange for gold, and he says that this is an obvious duty. The president also concurs with the secretary of the treasury in rec ommending that national banks be al lowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposit ed for circulation and recommends that national banks be allowed to or ganize on a capital of $25,000, in order to benefit localities not now sufficiently supplied with currency. The president makes a very strong point when he says that it is in times of business tranquillity and freedom from distrust that we should reform our monetary laws, and that we should not wait until danger again threatens before we take up in congress this very grave and important question. To this there will be no dissenting voice, and it is in accordance with the posi tion which this newspaper has assumed for many weeks. Taken all in all, the president has made good his pledge that he would rot neglect the question of currency reform, and after what he has said in his message the country will look to congress for a speedy relief from pres ent evils in our monetary system.

AMERICAN POLICY. Attitude of the President on the Cohan Question. No American, whatever his party or his prejudice with respect to Cuba may be, can read the president's message on the Cuban question without a thrill of pride. Of all the slate papers that have passed upon a problem that for many years has embarrassed the gov ernment of this country, we have not seen one that is a better expression of reason, cournge and patriotism. The message is a warning and a re buke to Spain, as well as an argument addressed to congress. The president does not harbor the sentimental theory that we have no rights in the struggle or that we would not be justified in intervening should the professions of the Spanish government prove false. On the contrary, his whole argument is based upon the theory that we have both the moral and the legal right to compel, peacefully, if possible, by force, if force becomes necessary, the equita ble and permanent adjustment of the claims of the Cubans. But he insists that this is a right that must be exer cised with caution, with decency, with a true respect for the rights of others and for our own obligations under in ternational law. And he sums up the position of the governmen-t in a passage of moving eloquence and dig nity: "The nfar future will demonstrate whether the Indispensable condition of a righteous peace. Just alike to the Cubans and to Spain, as well as equitable to all our interests, so Intimately involved in the welfare of Cuba, Is likely to be attained. If not the exigency of further and other ac tion by the United States will remain to be taken. When that time comes that action will be determined In the line of indisput able right and duty. It will be faced, with out misgiving or hesitancy In the light of the obligation this government owes to Itself, to the people who have confided to It the protection of their interests and honor and to humanity. "Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated only by UP' right and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion nor selfishness, the government will continue Its watchful care over the rights and property or American citizens and will abate none of Its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty Im posed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to Intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our Dart and only because the necessity of such action will be so clear as to com mand the support and approval of the civilized world." . Here is the true American policy- without fear and without reproach. It is health and sanity confronting the fever of jingoism and the anaemia of "peace at any price." It reassures the people that whatever steps may be taken for the relief of Cuba will be taken honestly, openly and fearlessly, "Sure of the right, keeping free from offense ourselves, actuated only by up right and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion or selfish ness," the government can take no ac tion that will not be cordially indorsed by every American.

SILVER I IE FALLACY. What the Mexicanlxatlon of vs Currency Would Dc. One of our European consuls has re ported that in Paris a syndicate has been formed with a capital of two mil lion Mexican dollars to establish a large factory of shoes, boots, etc., In Mexico. The work of construction will be commenced at once, and the object of the syndicate is to send an immense quantity of shoes of cheap quality to the American and European markets. Commenting on this item, a free silver organ says: "There Is no occasion for them to stop at 'cheap shoes;' they can make the best with equal profit to themselves. "It Is a singular thing that our financiers willfully shut their eyes to the prospective ruin of all our manufacturing industries by Mexico. "So many of our newspapers and finan ciers pretend to see no more In this silver question than one of making our obliga tions payable In a depreciated currency. "That is not the issue at all. "This difference In exchange, making a Mexican price of $2.32 for our gold dollar, will in time ruin every producer in the United States. "The question Is one of competition only. And the only reason why Mexico and other silver countries have not supplanted our manufactories before this to an extent of their extinction Is solely due to the lack of education to that end In silver countries. "In all else they are our masters, and can at will drive out of the open market every thing manufactured by gold nations." All of which is bosh. The difference in exchange has nothing to do with the subject at all. The root of the matter is, that in Mexico the wage rate is much, lower than in the United States or in Europe. There are thousands of people in the United States who do not under stand why a "dollar" in Mexico is not as valuable as a "dollar" in the United States, and until they recognize the dif ference between value and price they will fall into confusion. The fall in the world's price of silver since the early '70s has carried down with it the purchasing power of the Mexican dollar. Merchants there have put up their prices to correspond with its depreciation, while the rate of wages has not risen in the same degree. This is because of the ignorance of the masses of the Mexican people. The re sult is that Mexican laborers are work ing for much lower wages, in reality, than they were a dozen years ago. The laborer gets a Mexican dollar for his day's work, and who received a Mexi can dollar for the same amount of work ten years ago, receives about 30 cents less actual wages than he did then. This ignorance on the part of the peo ple of that country is the secret of the probable profits of the syndicate men tioned. It can hire labor much cheaper than in Europe or the United States. There Is nothing in the "rate of ex change" to make money for them. It Is simply a question of the cost of labor. Were the United States so foolish ns to adopt free coinnge, the drop in the purchasing power of our dollar would come at a bound, instead of being spread over 24 years. Our money sys tem would go to the silver standard. A dollar then would buy only about 44 per cent, as much ns it will now. Every laboring man would thus suffer an actual reduction of about 46 per cent, in his wages, and it would take a dozen years to bring wages up to their pres ent level. That is what the Mexicaniza tion of our currency really means to the laboring man. Toledo Blade. DRIFT OF OPINION.

C?"Speaker Reed says if the deficit does not end when the Dingley law be gins to operate under normal condi tions the republicans will enact legisla tion which will provide additional rev enue. Unquestionably they will. The republican is a debt-paying and not a debt-creating party. The democracy is the only party in this country which in creases the debt in time of peace. St. Louis Globe-Democrat. ET'The Dingley tariff law Is getting there all right. The receipts for the last four months, with November esti mated, were $90,348,000, which is about $7,000,000 more than was brought in by the Wilson-Gorman act during the first four months of its operation. This is a particularly good showing for the present law, for the reason that im porters held back to await the new and lower Wilson-Gorman duties, while the exact reverse was the case when the Dingley act went into effect. The new law will prove a good revenue raiser when it has a fair chance. Troy Times. C7Jo hear rne siiverttes talk one would suppose that there had been a general conspiracy of nations against coining silver into money, and that the United States was one of the Castilines of It. The United States coined last year over 21,000,000 silver dollars, and enough subsidiary silver to bring the total up to nearly $25,000,000. The, world's coinage, as shown by Secretary Gage, in bis annual report, was still more remarkable, $153,395,740. The to tal gold coinage of all the world during the year was $195,899,517. Evidently all ver is still a great money metal. Chi cago Inter Ocean. C7The president is correct in the opinion atttributed to him that if th greenbacks were retired there would be a howl of "contraction" from the Bryanites, even though the extln guished notes were replaced by bank currency. In holding the redeemed notes in the treasury, however, until exchanged for gold nobody would have a chance to say any currency was de stroyed or locked np. Of course, unless the revenues equaled the expenditures the holding of redeemed greenbacks un til gold was offered for them would force the treasury, in meeting the gov ernment's current expenditures, to pay out gold instead of currency, but there is some reason to expect that within two or three months the revenues win be ample. fit Louis Globe-Democrat.
