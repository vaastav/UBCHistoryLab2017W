OFFICE: No. 16 i^uiucy Street* TIUKSDAY, DEC. <i. 1?7|. Wheeling JournuliMic Enterprise. As usual, the liegidt\r office achieved a triumph over its newspaper neighbor hy distributing upon the street at four o'clock yesterday afternoon a very comprehensive synopsis ol the whole message, fourteen hours in advance of any other publication of its contents in this city. The uyuopsis was read and appreciated by very many of our citizens who lack the leisure necessary /or a perusal of the entire document?Regi*Urt yukrday. The " triumph" aforesaid consisted in issuing a prooi sheet, containing a single column, of what purported to be a "synopsis" of the President's message. Although the slip contained no real information, the publication of it is conceded to have been a stupenduous bit of enterprise, which was profoundly "appreciated" by the few who saw it. We believe there has never been anything like it in Wheeling. If the readers of the two papers will compare yesterday 's issues they will see that the Intklmoknckh had nearly fifteen columns of telegraphic news, while the lituuUr had exactly half a* much. We hud nine columns and a hulf besides the message; (he It*outer had lew than a column and a half. Wc had Bout* wki.l's Report; the Reguter had not. We had a report of proceedings in Congress, with lull list of House Committees; the IUyuter had no mention ot any meeting of Congress at all. Wc freely concede that to those who "lack the leisure" to read the news the litgUter offers the highest advantages. The Suicidal Foliicx of the Democracy. It* it were not that those who are to be destroyed are first made mad, we sup* pose the Democratic leaders would begin by this time to see that the more they fulminute against the dealings ot the Iiepublican administration with the Ku-Klux, the more fatally they run their heads against a stone wall. The more the existence and history of thus secret league in the South hive been investigated, the more undeniable has hccome the evidence of its wide-spread existenco, of its utterly infernal purposes, and ol its atrocious practices. Ever since the war the Democratic leaders have denied these things. The official investigations provoked bv their denials have dissipated every doubt about the existence of the order,its character, and its objects. It has been curious to sec how as this evidence hus accumulated the Democratic politicians and papers have increased the vehemcncc of their denials, and of their denunciation of the Government as responsible lor nil the turmoil in the Houtli ?lor they had not quite the cheek to deny that there was some trouble there. They have not been able to Bee, apparently, that the more they defended the Ku-Klux, the more the intelligent and honest sentiment of the country condemned them all together. The Democratic partyJftH a national organization had little fcnough of tl?e populur confidence at the close of the war; but the infatuation that has possessed its leaders to cling to the dead rebellion, and to resist the reconstruction of the Houth by tho dominant party and the rcassertion of Federal authority there, has steauily lessened that confidence, until now they themselves confess the organization to be on the verge of dissolution. Tlu?ri? ran Ik* tin dnttbt tlin hrttrr nr>nl|. ment ol tho country thoroughly approves what has been done by the Republican administration to put down the Ku Klux; and never was that approval bo strong a* at this moment; for there has never before heen so much and such overwhelming evidence touching the monstrous character of the order. The recent wholesale confessions in fcJoutli Carolina have laid bare the character of this league of midnight murderers in all its hideousness; and now more than ever tho country demands its extinction, and will not quibble about technicalities in the execution of that work. In this aspect of affairs, wc should expect the Democratic managers would at laat perceive their mistake. Hut no. They, neither learn nor forget. Tho first thing they do on the meeting of Congress in to take up the cudgels once more on behalf of the Ku-Klux. They want to know whether tho action of the President in breaking up the nefarious organization in South Carolina, and in the arrest of men guilty of savngerics that would disgrace the Apaches, has been strictly and technically regular; and Frank Ul-Ain, who. a South Carolina K-K. confesses is (Jrand Cyclops of tho order, hastens to olfrr the inquiry in the Senate, as a brother Democrat does in the House. As a matter ol party tactics could anything be more stupid ? Do not these gentlemen see that by keeping their party in the attitude of friends and defender* of ilm U' l' n.<.? (inly strengthen the popular dint rust of that party? Do they nut understand that tho country now knows all about the order, that no sympathy Is to be made among honest men anywhere by further attempts to white wash its infernal chatacter, and that every effort in this direction only cost* their party friends and confidence. There lias never been in political history a blinder infatuation than Hint which has prompted the Democratic lenders for the last five years to resist the ejforts of the party that was successful in the war to reconstruct the rebel States in accordance with its own policy. It was utterly impossible from the first that any surli re sistanco could succeed. Of nil the methods of resistanco none could be so hopeless as that of violence, seeing that a" the military power ofthe country wns in the hands of the dominant party and must, other means failing, l>c employed at last with a strong hand to put that violence down Such violence being employed by the law* leas element in the South, the sympathetic party in tho North could have made no moro fatal mistake than to attempt to conceal or npologi/.e for its atrocious crimes. These are some of the blunders that have )>een committed by the Democratic party. Having risked everything in resistance to reconstruction, the success ol reconstruction is necessarily fatal to iL Having united its fortunes with those ol a lawless organization, banded together lor purposes of terrorism and murder, it must ol necessity follow the lortunes of that league and perish with iL The time is near at hand when we are to witness this consummation. The success of Republican reconstruction in the South is assured. The Ku-lvlux and the Democratic party are alike in the throes ol dissolution, liut the ruling passion of the Democratic leaders is strong in death; and while they confess themselves on the verge of their political grave, they spend their last moments in idle repetition o! the follies tbut have brought them down to their last gasp.
