The Times in its editorial on the president', message, will bay: Ztfr. Cleveland has done an act of statesmanship in the best beiie. Recog nizing a great duty, he has performed it Nvith courage, with firmness, and at the right time, and lie has performed it so that every honest man must &ee that it is an honest act. Judged by an ordinary standard of politi cal expediency, the president's act is an ex pedient. If the protectionists faction in the Democratic party carry out their own desires, or do what they have continually declared they would do, Mr. Cleveland has done thertie thing by which he could im peril the prospect of his ownrenonnnation. It pleases Mr. Cle eland far above any of the leaders to whom the Republican party has of late lent a hearing; and above most of the leaders of his own party. The Sun will say: He declares that the theoretical question as between protection and free trade, is "entirely irrelevant" and jet the most striking andintereting part of the message 1 devoted to piecisely that tort of an argument with which any free trade representative in congress, or any .free trade professor in a college cla-s room, Dr the author of any free trade text book of political economy, would begin an attack upon the theory of protection. This, we say, is the most notable fact about the message. Mr. Cleveland lias never before in a public paper taken bides squarely upon this question. Helms done so now in a manner that leaves room lor no mis understanding. It is a bold tiling to do, und the president deserves credit for the plainness of his speech. The Hcnild will s'ty: The message will not please exfci em isis of either side, free traders or protectionists, but it will, we be lieve, please and satisiy thepeopleat large, and it puts upon both paities in congress the solemn duty to relieve the iiom a most serious danger. Loxnox, Dec. (.Thc Morning Post, commenting on Pi esident Cleveland's message, says: 'Die message will probably produce a profound sensation in Kuropc, as well as 111 Ameiiea, and will strengthen the free-traders' cause throughout the world. , The Daily Xews says: Seldom lias an American president bad a moie important orcompresMve lesson to teach. 'I he fact is, tli:it although President Cleveland makes a pretence of shutting his eyes to it, the policy of protection has been'ieduced to a practical and theoretical absurdity. The stone now set rolling will not stop till the idol of protection is broken in pieces. country

Las Chucks, X. 31., Dec. G. A protracted murder trial has. just been concluded in the district court at Socorro, the verdict being guilty of murder in the first degree. The defendants were Patrick Carmody, Desidirio .lojolo and Gonzales, who were charged with being parties to the lynching ot an old man by the name of Wiggins at San Marcial in 1882. The prosecution were not able to procure evidence to wan-ant an indictment until last year, when an indictment was found. It was shown upon the trial that Carmody had trouble with Wiggins because Wiggins was about to testify to some damaging facts against Carmody in a trial then pending. A short time before the trial Wiggins was hung to his own door-post in the presence of his wife, and Mrs. Wiggins identified the defendants as beiutr present and participating in the lynching. The case was hotly contested and ably conducted by Prosecuting Attorney Jack-on for the prosecution and Warren aud Ferguson for the defendants, but a conviction was the result. Carmody is an old man aud a pioneer in this country. ON

P. bearing the names of their owners at tached to them. As 1 stood watching the two men I read some of these names and was surprised to see such prominent ones as James Gordon Bennett, William K. Vanderbilt and many others that I have since forgotten. "AH here for repairs?" I inquired. "Oh, no," replied one of the bonny Scots, shutting his lips tightly immediate ly afterward, as if to prevent any secrets fiom escaping. "What are they here for, then?" I per sisted. "On storage," said the second Scotch man. "We take flno guns on storage, keep them in good repair and send them to the owners when they get ready for them." It is the only place of the kind in New York und probably in the country. Even in Europe it is a question whether such a thing exists. The wealthy gentlemen and nobles who have large country estates on the continent and in England have, so to speak, their private arsenals and armorers. Here they keep their firearms, certain plate for luat tney Wl11 be preserved and ready foi lounu notes u-e at any time. J uey can well allord to do this, as they need not go far to do their shooting, and may have occasion to do it at a very short notice. In this country, however, where large estates stocked with game are unknown and a shooting trip takes time and prepa ration, such private arsenals are not needed. Een the wealthiest and most extravagant do not find it necessary to employ private armorers, and most sports men take delight in'tleauing and putting away their own guns. Some though, who have great demands upon their time cither because of social or business cares, caunot afford or do not pare to bother with the work, and it is for them that this gun storage business was begun by the two Scotch brothers. As they nre first class workmen and very independent, only the wealthy sports men can afford to deal with them. They have conducted this business for many years, and in that time have been associ ated with all the prominent New Yorkers of sporting proclivities and have learned a great many of their characteristics. The trust reposed in them is verj- grea', as the Choice eating apples 1 a bushel at S. M. Supply Co. d6-tf Finney, "the T man," 111 S.

There were extensive forests of scrubby oaks, and most of the deposit was on the leaves. Thousands of the poor peasants, men, women and children, were out upon the plains gathering the sweet substance. Some of them plunge into kettles of boil ing water the newly cut branches of the oaks, which washes off the deposit until the water becomes so sweet as to remind the Yankee of a veritable sugaring off in tlie old Granite state as- he takes sips of it.
