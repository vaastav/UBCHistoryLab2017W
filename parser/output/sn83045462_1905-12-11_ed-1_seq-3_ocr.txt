Arrest of Noted Labor Leader at St. Petersburg EAISEl) A GREAT STORM INDICATIONS FATEFUL REACTION IN RUSSIA HAS COME. Newspapers to Dffy t he Temporary Press L?w?Situation in Livo nia Frightful. ST. PETERSBURG, Sunday. December 10 (mornlng\ via Eydrkuhnen, East Prus sia. December 11.?There is every indica tion this morning tliat the government's challenge will be accepted and that within forty-eight hours a general strike through out Russia will be ordered. A terrible ?torm has been raised l>y the arrest of M. Krustaleff, president of the executive cr.mmittee of th?i workmen's council, which ?was followed during the night by the im prisonment of the members of tho work men's council and a number of socialistic leaders. "The reaction has come." were the words on every lip and in the liberal extremist camp there was only one opinion, namely, that it must be resisted to the bitter end. At all the meetings last night, some of which 1 ;\sted until morning the opinion was unanimous that the government had forced the hands of the proletariat and that the supreme weapon, a general strike, must be invoked. j The newspaper editors at yesterday even ing's meeting decided that the temporary press law forbidding the discussion of vital questions affecting the welfare of the na tion violated the principles of freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the imperial manifesto and ttiat it must be de fled. The result was that the editions of the Rua? and half a dozen more radical papers were confiscated. The employes of the Riga-Orel railroad have declared a strike on account of the declaration of martial law in Livonia and have sent an appeal to the other roads to Join. Last night the railroad men of tho Baltic lines decided to follow the exam ple of the Riga-Orel men. Anarchy in Livonia. Tho situation in Livonia is frightful. Absolute anarchy prevails. A messenger who arrived here this morning declared that the streets of Riga were flowing with blood. After a meeting the railroad j men of Riga were mowed down by the , flre of machine guns and artillery. The railroad men of St. Petersburg, at a meeting yesterday evening, resolved that Inasmuch "as the reaction is gaining l'orce and the government is seeking to retract what was won by the flrst pan Russian strike," the railroad men stand ready to obey the signal for a general strike, but advise their fellow workers to await the word from the central commit tee at Moscow, as a failure must not be risked. Wholesale Arrests at Moscow. Simultaneously with the arrests here M. Dronshllny and all the members of the union of the employes of the posts and telegraph operators of Moscow, with M. Kokhanowsk! at their head, were arrested at Moscow. Interior Minister Durnovo today Issued an official proclamation not only notifying all the post and telegraph employes that their failure to return to work tomorrow will be equivalent to thetr discharge, but that all those who agitate for a continuance of the strike or are guilty of cutting or otherwise | destroying wires and apparatus will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Soototh Gang of Counterfeiters Believ Toils. 1X>? J*iNCI^KH^Ci??U>tide?nS*ihoij i U.-ln the arre-st ycstararay.'OTrifnaaifr WeUffi jUias Wilder and Joseph Castfcoi, a-Hah Ijftwrcnce by U. S. Secret Service Agent Oronin atui officers fro mthe central police station, it Is believed that one of the smoothest gangs of counterfeiters that has operated on the Pacific coast for years was broken up. With the prisoners a quantity of para phernalia and sufficient evidence Is said to be possessed toy the officers to permit of a prosecution of the charge. The men are alleged to have been operat ing In Los Angeles, San Eranclsco, Oak land and a number of California cities for several months past, flooding the coast with bogus bills. They have been under survell ance for some time. The raisin* of (2 bills to the denomina tion of ?T> and $10 is said to have been the principal occupation ot ths counter itilank Few in Those of Important Chairmanships. TAWNEY - BARTHOLDT WERE REALLY THE ONLY TWO; THE FORMER PREDICTED. Mr. McCleary Satisfied With His Transfer to the Ways and Means Body. The make-up of the House committees shows very few changes In the chairman ship of important committees. In fact there are on!}- two among, the most coveted chair, manships, appropriations and public build ings and grounds. Mr. Tawney gets the former, as was forecasted in The Star last Bummer, and Mr. Bartholdt of Missouri falls heir to the latter in regular order of succcssion. The nomination of Mr. Tawney to the head of appropriations was accomplished James A. Tawney, Chairman Appropriations Committee, by the transfer of Mr. McCiejiry to ways I and means, a char.gp which Speaker Can non desired on account of Mr. McCleary's exceptional iitness as an economist and tiis pronounced high protection views. Mr. McCleary was placed high on the list of ways and means, coming immediately after the oldest men in service on the committee, Payne, Dalzell and Grosvenor. Mr. McCleary Satisfied. "I am entirely satisfied with the arrange | rr.ent," said Mr. McCleary this afternoon. "I am very much more interested In the j wise solution of great national problems than in the details of appropriations. At the same time, my six years of experience on the committee on appropriations will en | able me to keep an intelligent watch on public expenditures. "Ever since the battle for the gold stand j ard was fought Hnd won I have been desir I ous of becoming a member of the com mittee on ways and means, which frames | all tariff bills and other revenue legisla tion. and which can therefore so greatly affect for weal or woe all the people of the country. But Mr. Tawney was on that committee, and. of course, I would not al low myself to antagonize him in his com mittee assignments. Now my way is clear. And at this time, when the fundamental principles of wise tariff legislation seem to require clear and vigorous restatement and unflinching application, I am convinced Richard Bartholdt, Chairman Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. that Speaker Cannon is right in urging that a duty to the country much higher and more important than that possible even as chairman of the committee on appropria tions calls me to the committee on ways and means. And where my duty lies, there I go cheeerfully. ?'On the ways and means committee I shall have better opportunity Chan ever to help protect the interests of the entire country, and especially those of the farm ers of the central part of the continent, whose interests seem to be at this time the special objects of attack by certain power ful elements in Boston, Montreal and else where. * "I am glad that the chairmanship of the appropriations committee comes to Minne sota. Mr. Tawney is an Intelligent and in dustrious man. While he has had no ex perience In framing appropriation bills, and has practically everything to learn in that line. I hope that in due time he will master the difficulties and perform the duties of the position with honor to hJmself, credit to the state and profit to the country'." Mr. MoCleay retains the chairmanship of the library committee. Other Chtairmanship Changes. Other chairmanship changes were as fol lows: Pacific railways. Thomas 8. Butler of Pennsylvania, vice W. A. Smith, trans ferred to membership on ways and mean*; levees and improvements of Mississippi riv?\ George W. Prince of Illinois, vice Bartlioldt, to public buildings and grounds; claims, James M.

Lincoln's Gettysburg Address to Be Perpetuated in Metal. Secretary Taft returned to Washington this morning from Gettysburg, Pa., where he went to select a site for the location of the bronze tablet ordered to lx? erected there by Congress to perpetuate the famous memorial address delivered on that battle field by President Lincoln in July, 1864. The secretary was accompanied by Gen. J. R. Brooke, U. S. A., retired Judge Advo cate General George B. Davis, Col. Nichol son of the Gettysburg Park commission and Representative DeArmond of Missouri. It is expected that Secretary Taft will announce his action In a few days. The tablet cannot be erected on the spot where the martyred President stood on that me morable occasion for the reason that It Is already occupied by a monument to some of the soldiers who fell In the battle. 

AFFAIRS OF VENEZUELA. It is Expected That the President Will Send a Message to Congress. It is expected that the President will make the recent diplomatic correspond ence with the government of Venezuela In regard to the disputed claim of the New York & Bermudez Asphalt Co. against the Venezuelan government the subject of a special .message to Congress. This Is given as a plausible explanation of the reason for the omission of any reference to the controversy by President Roosevelt In hla regular message to Congress. Another reason given for the delay In submitting this matter to the legislative branch is that the President is awaiting the detailed report of Mr. Calhoun, the special commissioner sent to Venezuela to make a thorouglf personal investigation of the matters in dispute between the United States and President Castro's government. So far as can be learned the case has long since passed the acute stage, and is now in a fair way of settlement. If, Indeed, that result has not already been attained. Respecting the more serious differences between the governments of France and Venezuela, It is staged on good authority that President Roosevelt has receivea positive assurances from the French government that the movement of Its warships near the Venezuelan coast does not contemplate any infringe ment of the spirit of the Monroe doc trine. It la on account of the assur ance that France has no intention of seiz ing Venezuelan territory, that the United States has tacitly acquiesced in the pro posed French naval demonstration in Vene zuelan waters. The exact policy of France in this matter has not been disclosed. The future movements of the fleet which has been anchored at Martlnque for several weeks will be olosely watched, however, by the United States, and also by the European powers Interested in the financial welfare of Venezuela. fortune for a Farm Hand.

SECRET CONSISTORY AT ROME. The Second Function of Present Pope's Pontificate. ROME, December 11?The pope today held a secret consistory, which w?* the sec ond of his pontificate, in which he created new cardinals, and apparently showed a tendency to have a better equilibrium be tween the foreign and Italian elements in the sacred college, as three of tho four new cardinals are foreigners. The cere mony waj performed with the usual pomp Nearly thirty cardinals were present. The pontiff appeared walking and preeeeded, surrounded and followed by the gorgeous pontifical court. Then all withdrew ex cept tho members of the sacred college and the pope read his allocution. In it he said he wished he could give' the cardinals pleasant and consoling news, but the con ditions at the present timo do not permit of consolation. Although, he continued, the Catholic faith is spreading more and more throughout the world, especially in dissi dent countries, on turning toward Catho lic nations one feels sadness and fear lest the prediction of the Scriptures Is being verified, that the kingdom of the Lord will be removed to other people, where it will produce good fruit. Especial care and anxiety may be felt for the country here tofore called the eldest daughter of the church, but concerning the anti-Catholic laws passed there agalns* the laws of jus tice, the pope said he would speak in ac cordance with his apostolic office more gravely and more fully at an opportune time. He exhorted the cardinals to prayer, recalling that the Lord will cause tran quility and peace to shine forth at the proper time. The pontiff ended with saying that he in tends to honor the whole Latin-American race by creating for tho first time a cardi nal belonging to that part of the world. Immediately after reading his allocution he created the following cardinals: The most Rev. Joseph Samassa, arch bishop of Erlnu, Hungary. Mgr. Spinola, archbishop of Seville. Mgr. J. A. DeArcoverde de Albuquerque Cavalcanti. archbishop of Rio Janeiro. Mgr. Cagaino de Azevedo, major domo of the Vatican. The cardinals asserted that, contrary to the popular impression, the pope did" not create a fifth cardinal, but reserved the appointment in pectore. Later the pope appointed a number of bishops. Including the following: The Rev. G. Barin, bishop of Nueva Caceres, Philip Pine Islands: the Rev. T. Meerschaert bishop of Oklahoma: the Rev. T. Brennan' formerly bishop of Dalles, Tex., titular bishop of Cassarea, and the Rev, A. Schln ner, bishop of Superior, Wis. Mgr.

Home Life Affairs Before In vestigating Committee NEW YORK CITY TODAY PRESIDENT IDE ON THE STAND EXPLAINED OPERATIONS. Declared Ee Carried No Life Policies? Officials of the Company Shared Commissions. NEW YORK. December 11.?An Investi gation of the Affairs cif the Home I^ife In surance Company of New York was taken up by the legislative Insurance Investigat ing committee today. The first witness called was George E. Ide, president of that company. Personally lie carried no life insurance, he said, but lie thought some of the officials of his company may have received commis sions on their own policies. He was asked by Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the com mittee, to furnish a list of them. Mr. Ide said bis company is paying a pen sion of $1,000 a year to a clerk who was employed since the foundation of the com pany, and is now unable to work. Mr. Ide described the financial operation of his company, and said it makes invest ments in .stocks and bonds through one firm of brokers, and pays them the regu lar commission of one-eighth of 1 p?>r cent. The surplus of his company has been held at about $1,125,000 for twenty years, because he regards that as sufficient and he felt that policyholders are entitled to the accumulations on th'eir policies. Mr, Hughes said all but 11 per cent of the company's business is on deferred div idend policies. Mr. Ide said the dividends are paid annually to policies so stipulating, but on others the accumulations are ap portioned to each policy each year. The present amount of that accumulation is $1,290,000. A policy holder who requests It is told what amount of dividends Is credited to his policy each year. Mr. Ide described in de tail his company's method of finding and crediting these dividends. An Annual Expose. Mr. Ide said this practice of making an annual statement is "an annual expose" of the conduct of the company's business, and is embarrassing to him. Assemblyman Cox by questions elicited from Mr. Ide that this is a salutary cheek on the payment of the liigh commissions for new business, and' makes it difficult to secure new business as compared to other companies which do not make this annual expose. Mr. Hughes read and questioned the wit ness about a circular which Mr. Ide had Issued recently in wihich he said the de l'errod dividends plan causes the accumu lation Of a Wg surplus Which, In hds opln oin, leads to a lax and extravagant condi tion of business because the company Is not compelled to account to the policy holder until litis policy matures. Mr. Ide said his company has met that condition by making Its annual accounting to the policy holders. 

WINTER DRILLS OF WARSHIPS. Display of the North Atlantic Fleet to Be Imposing. Special Dispatch to The Star. PORTSMOUTH, Va., December 11.?The winter drills of the North Atlantic fleet will be this year the most Interesting and | the display of naval strength the most Im posing that has ever before been possible j with the American navy. The battUshlps Iowa and Kentucky, now undergoing repairs at the navy yard in this city will rendezvous in Hampton Roads on the 6th of January, with the most magnifi cent fleet ever assembled under the Ameri can flag. There will be two battleship squadrons, a flotilla of destroyers and an other division which for lack of ships has never before appeared in the evolutions. Heretofore the only armored cruisers we have had in commission have been the New York and Brooklyn, and on account of their comfort and speed they have usually been assigned to the various squadrons as flag ships. Now, at last, however, there is a distinct squadron of armored cruisers, un der command of Rear Admiral Brownson, the officer who won fame at Rio de Ja neiro with the little Detroit. The plans now contemplate an elaborate series of drills at sea, which will continue from the time the fleet departs from Hamp ton Roads, after an inspection here by the Secretary of the Navy and Admiral Dewey, to the time It starts north from the Car ibbean in the spring. Every vessel of the powerful fleet is be ing put In first-class trim at the various navy yards, and when Admiral Dewey takes command in the south he will have under him an Invincible lighting force of twelve armored ships of battleship and cruiser class, and with the addition of the destroy ers and the cruisers, a fleet numerically stronger than the entire American navy at the outbreak of the Spanish-American war. The rendezvous of the fleet In Hampton Roads will of itself be one of the most im posing naval spectacles of modern times, and this will be the only opportunity afford ed the people of this country to see their navy assembled in full force. Therefore It Is believed that there will be many visitors here In January. FIRMS DRIVEN TO 0 AN AD A. Alleged Alarming Conditions From Tariff Restrictions. CHICAGO, December 11?Some alarming conditions which are rapidly driving large manufacturing Interests from the United States to Canada are to be considered with in a few days by the Illinois Manufacturers' Association. Reports Just gathered show that 132 of the leading concerns of the country have been obliged, chiefly on account of tariff restrictions, to establish branch plant? In Canada. Flfteeen of these industries have headquarters In Chicago. The resulting loss financially is estimated at upward of >50.000,000, of which Amount Chicago Is represented In the statistics to have suffered a large proportion. The agita tion "which the Illinois Manufacturers are about to start Is expected to assume a form shortly of a national appeal to Congress. The remedy most In favor locally and throughout the country provides for reci procity legislation which will permit of the freer exchange of American and Canadian manufactured products. It Is likely that Congress will be asked during the present session to take soma steps in this direction. No Army Officer Named Swain. It le said at the War Department that there is no officer in the army active or re* tired named Hugh N. Swain. A man of that name, according to press reports, was acquitted of the charge of murder at Hous ton, Tex., yesterday. The accused was de scribed In the press report as being a re tired officer of the army. Nantucket Shoals Vessel Re ported Leaking.
