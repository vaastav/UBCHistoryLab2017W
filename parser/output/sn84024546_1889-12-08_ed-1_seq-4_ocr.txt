CIBCUWSTAHaTAL BUT IMPBOBABTiE, How much dependence is to be placed Upon the reported plan for the organization of a great international bank under the 'auspices of Pope Leo is, at least, a debatable question. "While a New Tork paper under takes to give names of directors and details as to location, capital and manner of opera tion, wi(h much semblance of particularity, the general tendency will be to await con firmation before accenting the report It is improbable the banking business can "be conducted to advantage in connection with religions organizations. Experiments which have been made by church organiza tions in the TJnited States in the conduct of .financial enterprises on a great scale are not particularly encouraging. The experience of the publishing concerns of Bome of the Evangelical churches, and of Archbishop Purcell, at Cincinnati, were not hopeful in that regard. In this country, at least, ecclesiastical banking would scarcely be re garded as ol great help either to any of the denominations or to the general business in terests. In this view it sounds rather absurd to hear it stated that grave fears are expressed by some of the leading New York financiers about the "vast political as well as financial influence" which would attach to the new enterprise. Neither politics nor business in the TJnited States tends toward a denomi national basis. And like as not, regardless of the circumstantiality of the account pub lished by the New York Herald yesterday, it will be found that the plans of the re ported new bank are more imaginary than rcaL SMOKING FOB CLEEGTMEH. , The disenssion of the question, ''Should ' Clergymen Smoke?" in another part of this issue, gives a variety of views on the subject which are more or less valuable as personal opinions. The logical way of determining the matter would be by first settling the prior question, "Should any man smoke?" and then governing the clergymen by the decision as to all man kind. If it be injurious and wrong for bankers and lawyers to smoke, then, it would be for clergymen to do so; if the former find it salutary or innocuous the clergymen have the same right to partake of a harmless enjoyment as other men; just as they have the same right to drink Java coffee or eat Saratoga potatoes. The ques tion may be of importance just as it may be Taluable to determine whether bankers should indulge in chicken salad or criminal lawyers eat mince pie. But the decision must apply to all humanity and not to any especial class or profession. BttCOJTS OBJECT LESS0K. If the vanished Silcott had planned his ' departure for the sole purpose of giving the 4 statesmen with whom be enjoyed snch con fidential terms, an object lesson on the ne cessity of an amended extradition law, he could not have done it more completely. By delicately skating along the edge of the ex ? traditable offenses, and paying back the h money which he had obtained through . forgeries," which might have brought him back, the departed Silcott is able to live in Canada comfortably on the salaries of the statesmen, and the fleeced Congressmen are left to profound reflections on the inade quacy of extradition. It is an old principle that it gives a man the most thorough insight into an injury, to have his own ox gored; and the Congress- 'f 'men whose cash accounts are depleted with- i out any way of getting at the robber, will "be deeply impressed with the wrongs of pub lic plunder. It is true that several thrifty legislators have already developed a theory that the TJnited States must make up the loss. They may log-roll the measure through Congress, but nevertheless the discomforts of making the TJnited States treasury pay their salaries twice over, on account of a loss of which ineir own agent was tne cause, should make them eager for improved ex tradition laws, and create some fellow feeling on their part with the people who supply the funds in the treasury. Taking it all in all, a certain admiration at the originality of Silcott's stroke is irre- "prestible. Baidson the treasury have be come commonplace in the House he served, and were by no means horrifyiug to some of the members thereof. But Silcott struck out a new line by raiding the private treas- fraj of the Congressmen, and let in a flood of new light as to the possibilities of grab bing any funds that can be got at. A C0EP0BATE BABIES. A Tery striking example of corporate morals is exposed to public view in the history of a case just decided by the "Wis consin Supreme Court. One company made an agreement with another that if the latter would secure from the Legislature a valu able land grant, the first would give in re turn valuable trackage rights. The legisla tive lobbying was done successfully, and railroad No. 1 got its land grant; bnt when called'upon to perform its half of the bar gain refused to do it The suit to make it do so was thrown out by the courts nn ihn ground that it was void at against public (' policy and tending to corruption. The legal and moral aspect of the decision is in disputable: but it seems as if the criminal 1 conrU .might have sossethinj: to say to the parties to such, a bargain. In the meantime the corporations who dispose of legislative acts as a matter of barter, should have dis cretion enough to at least .keep their con tracts a secret FBANCE'S SCHEME OF TAXATION. It appears from one of our cable specials that the French Government proposes to adopt the measure agitated in this country last rear, of imposing a capitation tax on all foreigners in France, and a further tax on all employers of foreign-born labor. The amount of taxation is not very great, being $4 80 on the foreigners who do not work, and $10 in addition on each laborer of other nationalities. The measure may be a good one for a na tion which desires to keep ont foreigners. With regard to those who simply go to France to sojourn there, the impression has been that France desired their presence, and that they were already sufficiently taxed by the tradesmen, art dealers and hotel keepers. The tax on the laborers, on the other hand, will be heavy enough to exclude a great many such laborers or to force them into pauperism. But as labor is the creator of wealth, it does not seem a logical deduction either to shut it out or to force it into invol untary idleness at the expense of the public Measures of this sort are bettor adapted to the Chinese or Corean objects of Govern ment than to those which are supposed to be aimed at by civilized Bepublics like France and the United States. THE L1TXUBY 0? DECABEHCK Mrs. Frank Leslie's discussion of the growth of bachelor, or "Benedict," chambers in which the unmarried man is made com fortable for life without any thought of marriage, unfolds a very plausible and probably correct theory, as to the effect of wealth and luxury, in making social life selfish and consequently predisposing young men who wish to enjoy life untrammeledby family caret, against marriage. But it involves more than the question of matrimony when it is represented by a writer on social subjects, that it is the destiny, as a nation gains in wealth, that makes "capital become concentrated, rich men wealthier, poor men poorer, and labor less honorable." This has been the result in most cases because of the existence of special privileges for certain classes;but to assert that it is inevitable, is to abandon the funda mental principles of our Government. The American Bepublio is founded on the belief that by giving all men equal chances the' gain in wealth will be widely distributed; and while the old result is repeated in many cases, it is, in every case of egregious wealth, directly traceable to the fact that the princi ple of equality of opportunity and impar tial treatment before the law, has been vio lated. The story is sot ail told until it is pointed out that the stage of wealth and luxury, which produces the effects that Mrs. Leslie deplores, is only reached by the nullification of our democratic principles and generally by the violation of the laws. BISHOP TDIGG'S DEATH. The death of Bishop Tuigg at the epis oopal residence yesterday removes the head of the Catholic Church in this diocese, who has had control of that powerful religious organization since the retirement ol Bishop Domenec many years ago. The executive bead of a large and centralized organization like the Catholio Church exerts a powerful influence in the community, and probably few men have exercised a greater effect oh Pittsburg's population, with so little promi nence before the general public, as the late prelate. His administration of the diocese revealed a character in which a strong will, energetic temperament and decided convic tions were leading features. Perhaps as just a measure of his work as can be found may be taken from the growth of the,hos pitals, colleges and seminaries supported by the Catholio denomination in this diocese, and in the enhancement of the numerical power and prosperity of his church. STANLEY'S BELIEF IK PE0YIDENCE. One remarkable characteristic appears in the letters from Stanley, which have reached the world since he has emerged from the African wilds through which he conducted his great researches. That is his frank and unreserved avowal of his belief in the aid of an overruling and divine Providence which rescued himself and his allies from the greatest dangers and enabled his expedition to win success through a series of dangers that at various times threatened to overwhelm it with total fail ure. Hardly any more complete or devout attribution of the credit for his achievements to a Higher Power could be made, than the letter in which the successful explorer shows how the very disasters which delayed him, worked out the successful results which were finally achieved. This is the more remarkable because the character and temper of Stanley in his earlier career were not especially marked for devoutness. Self-reliant, determined, wary and courageous, he has heretofore seemed to hold the principle that Providence helps those who help themselves. That he has abandoned the belief in works as well as faith is not likely; but he has never before shown the religious spirit so prominently. It would almost seem that as Stanley in herited and enlarged Dr. Livingstone's mission of opening, up the dark places of Africa, so he has succeeded to the mission ary explorer's earnest and constant faith. Possibly, the spirit may have its origin in his intercourse with Livingstone on his first expedition, when the patient inspiration of the older man was steadily leading him to his lonely death in the effort to solve the mystery of the Lualalu. Yetin view of the fact that Stanley's com panionship with Livingstone lasted but a few months, and occurred many years ago, may not this devout belief be ascribed to the influence which surrounded the efforts of both explorers. May there not be some thing in the struggle with the forces of nature, the observation of savage life, and the pursuit of heroic efforts remote from the centers of civilization and the competition of "enlightened selfishness" which teaches the ardent mind that Providence is over all, and that hnman weakness is strongest in its reliance on a Supreme Being? There is certainly a strong commentary on the efforts of philosophers who sit in easy chairs and elaborate agnostic theories, that men of snch heroic achievements as Stanley and Livingstone are by the very record of their struggles brought to a clear belief in the existence of Divine Provi dence. The sad news comes from New Tork that the baby hippopotamus recently added to the population of that city bad died because its lanes could not stand the climate. Chicago will not be slow to draw the moral of the obvi ous impropriety of asking tho world to come and enjoy an international exposition in a cli mate that is too moist for a yoasg river hog. The sad remark is made by she Miaseap olis Pioneer Press with regard to" the light he havioreC eeef the numbers of Cob ess during the reading of the President's message: 'The disposition to treat the reading of the message as a joke Is one of the depressing signs of the times." In that case the most ob vious remedy Is to avoid methods of.presenting the message, 'which make it a Joke. It may be disrespectful to say that the Jealous guarding of a collection of platitudes, as II It contained the secret of the ages, and its presentation to Congress to be read OTallywhenitcould twice as conveniently be understood if published to the world on the morning of the meeting. is one of the jokes of the day; bat there is nevertheless more fact than Imagination In the assertion. Solemn humbug is looked upon In the most charitable way when taken as a joke. The statement, on apparently good au thority, that the WiUiamsport Flood Commis sioners are going to allow themselves five dol lars a day out of the relief fund, Indicates that those officials think that the relief fond belongs to the sufferers, and that they are the sufferers. It is, after all, a little uncomplimentary to oar system of justice that the one murderer found guilty of murder in the first degree by an Allegheny county jury these many years should be a friendless negro. The statement during the week that soine purchases were made of claims against the Lawrence Bank it the rata of CO cents on the dollar seems to furnish an additional reason for expediting at least a proximate official state ment Of the assets and liabilities. If the de positors sell their claims at less than the bank will pan out, they will have made a losing transaction through tholr uncertainty of the condition of things. On the other hand, if those who buy pay more than can be realized, the number of losers will be increased. Thus it is that speculation In the claims will scarcely bring any additional satisfaction Into the situa tion: and that an official indication of the prob able salvage becomes doubly desirable, "With one 250-barrel well, a 800-barrel well, a SOO-barrel well and a 2,100-barrel well re ported from the different districts in the lower oil field it does not look as If the yield of Penn sylvania oil were by any means a thing of the past. The Chinese mob which has been de stroying American property at Nankeen teems to be strongly of opinion that what Is sauce for the Mongolian goose is sauce for the American gander. A COEeespondeut elsewhere pursues the discussion as to the respective cost of living at Philadelphia and in this city, with con clusions to the advantage of Philadelphia, The fact of the matter seems to be that the work lnginen can get an equally good house and equally good living at a slightly less cost in Philadelphia, perhaps, for the very cogent reason that he has considerably less wages to pay for it withal. Bnt Pittsburg is rapidly in creasing her supply of small homes for the working people, and her transit facilities for getting to them. The railroad company which proposes to furnish each purchaser of a ticket with an ac cident insurance policy lays itself open to the gibo of the scoffers that It hat a very clear Idea of the most obTions need of travelers over its line. Tub certainty that the postal detectives express of catching that mall pouch thief war rants a fear that the thief has already reached the mysterious hiding place of Tascott CoKCEENnro the fact that Justice Field and Justice Brewer, who will Sit on the Supreme Bench together are nephew and uncle, the Bos ton JScrotrf remarks: ''Law seems to run in the family." Perhaps so; bnt it is also possible to Intimate that another trait which has run in that family is that of cultivating close relations with the great corporate interests that take care to give attention to the composition of the Supreme Court. The controversy between Governor For aker and the un-gubernatorial Campbell grows somewhat unprofitable. Both parties should re ceive private advice upon the golden qualities ot silence, especially in cases like theirs. The announcement that Alger is mad over the appointment of Brewer comes nearer to a satisfactory indorsement of Brewer than anything which preceded it. Again our esteemed cotemporaries in rival cities are indulging in chastened joy over the report that Pittsburg's natural gasv Supply is giving out. Except for the exhibition of foolishness In the papers that are circulating this old fable, Pittsburg need not object to it It amuses them, and does no harm to the thousands of Pittsburg people who continue to enjoy the cleanliness and convenience of gas fires. If Uncle Jerry Busk will contract to re form the brand of weather we have had during 1SS9, by all means let him have the weather bureau in his department and preserve the reputation of the Administration. Jury fixers and spies are both rather un pleasant elements of the present day. But there is the radical distinction between them that the purpose of one class is to reduce the system of justice to a farce and give law break ers impunity; while no one" can be harmed by the other who respects and obeys the laws. Electric wires hindered the work of the firemen In Boston, Minneapolis and at the Mon ongahela House fire. And, still, the overhead wire does not go,

TOPICAL TALEEEA A Slip ol the Foot la n Baaaeroas Thing to a Dancer The True History ef How Ode Thanksgiving Dinner Felt in the Sonp. Chubbt and graceful Frauleln Clara Quail tz lost her balance in one of those whirling spins she is so fond of yesterday afternoon. It was at the matinee performance of "Bluebeard," and Qualitz, in her character ot an ostrich was ever there a sprinter of the desert so plumpT appeared to take part in the grand ballet divertissement. Bho started out to swing around the stage, inclining toward its' center; and, as she reacnea tne top or tne stage, she tost her balance and fell. Apparently she sus tained no hurt, and she finished her pas seul with her remarkable smile undiminished. It Is curious how Qualitz always can command that smile, which shows her regular teeth so well and makes her hardest work seem child's play to her audience. Once they say Qualitz humped Into a cory phee, and their two heads came together with a prodigious crack. Qualitz smlledsweetly and murmured an apology, but the ballet girl cried, as well she might, tor the blow was a hard one. Qualitz was asked why she did not cry, and she said; "I cry? Before the audience? No, no, I always smile." But 1 di not refer to the mishap ot a premiere danseuse to get a chance to enlarge upon her smile. What I wanted to ask my readers or such of them as confess to seeing a ballet now and again Is, whether they ever realize what a dangerous thing it is to execute a pas seul upon a crowded stage ? That very movementln which Frauleln Qualitz stumbled yesterday is one of the most Difficult and dangerous a premiere executes. Whirling around a stage at a headlong gait, the taster the bettor, the louder the applause, the dancer runs the risk of colliding with other people, the wings and the proscenium arch. Some ten years ago I saw a dancer, unable tostopher Beltatthe right moment, fall upon the foot lights, and she was carried from the stage a mass of names. A bit or wood, a Chance nail, a morsel ot tin or tinsel from the trappings of tne ballet, any one ox tnese may trip the premiere as she pirouettes on hei toe points, with her eyes toward the gods and her mind thinking of naught but the cadence of the music and the intricate steps before her. V Two or three days ago in a Missouri lumber camp one man chopped another to pieces with an ax for impugning his ability as a cook. He was the coot of the camp, and he could not allow sneers at his culinary capabilities to pass unremarked. A tragedy somewhat like the above, only a little more humorous and a trifle less ghastly, occurred In a Pittsburg household a few days ago. The day before Thanksgiving the late dinner to which the family sat down was a modest little affair, as dinners are apt to be on the erect a festival. But its modesty shrank out ot sight behind the atrocious cooking ot the meal.

You know a family wiH make remarks about a meal that is served in this fashion. Bome of the younger members of the circle were ex tremely sarcastic. The girl who waited at the table reported these allusions to the cook as toon as possible; and there was a sound of load talking below stairs all the evening. Bnt nobody thought anything of that; It had oc curred before. There was no other warning of the impending disaster given to the devoted family, V As materfamilias descended the stairs the next morning, and made her way to the dining room in how many families the mother is the goodly example In early rising! a savory, and yet somewhat peculiar odor saluted her nos trils. So, Instead of entering the dining room. She passed on downstairs to the kitchen. The only occupant of the kitchen was the house maid, whose appearance was enough to scare anybody out of a year's healthy growth. "Janet" said the ladyof the house sternly, "Janet what is the matter T Where's Mary?" Mary was the cook. ''Idunno, mum,' said Jane;- 'Wie've gone and took her trunk!" Then the inquisitor observed that a large wash-boiler was resting on the kitchen range, and that the fumes she had smelt upstairs were rising from it. "What's cooking there 7" she asked.

RlcmioiO), December 7. Jefferson Davis was known personally to a larger number of people in Richmond than in perhaps any other City. Citizens who Werechildren during the war recall his regular evening ride on a gray horse, which he sat splendidly. Dr. Charles Brock, a prominent physician and a fine horseman, re calls an Incident of this time. He says tharfone evening he was riding a mare that was so vicious that bo could do nothing with her. While the animal was bucking on a turnolke' near this city, Mr. Davis rode up and said: "That is a una animal. Doctor." The Doctor replied that he would like to see Mr. Davis ride her. The latter said that he would like to take a spin, and they changed horses. "He had no sooner taken the reins," said the Doctor, "than with one easy poll he had her entirely under subjection. Then he put spurs -and rode her three miles, and I tell you Bhe was subdued enough when he re turned her to me. It was the finest riding I ever saw." Governor Fitzhugh Lee, himself a noted horseman, says Mr. Davis was the finest horse man, he oversaw. On one ot bis lonely rides Mr. Davtswas fired upon by a man hid In the bushes, the ball whistling dote to his head. He rode bis horse straight In the direction from which the missile came, and tbe would-be assassin' fled, but was caugbthy some soldiers.

Congressman Oates,Tf Alabama, has during the last few years been paying a good deal of attention to the kindred subjects of immigration and nat uralization. It was dne to his efforts, mainly, that the last Congress appointed a committee to investigate the question of immigration, which succeeded Jn breaking up at least a part of the padrone system, and brought at least one of the principals to punishment: Mr. Oates Is nowpreparing a bill to combine the provisions contained in two bills Intro, ducedbyhlm In the last Congress. He has come to the conclusion that a law whose tendency wonld be to restrict promiscuous Im migration most also make some provision for the proper naturalization of such lmmlnanta as are Invited to come to these shores. He pro poses to prevent the coming into this coun try of any person previously convicted of crime, and of polvgamlsts and paupen. Immigrants, before they will be allowed to land In the united Btates, must produce a cer- uuMiswiuuuuiaana irom tne ..American Consnl located nearest to their homes 3n their native country. Then he proposes to do away with tnat part of the present naturalization laws which permits of a foreigner "declaring his Intentions," antt thus obtaining the full benefits of citizenship withont being compelled to take out his final papers. An Immigrant, under Mr. Oates" bill, will be required jo have resided five full years In this country before he can be admitted to citizen ship. He mustgo before a Judge, satis ry that functionary that he can speak, and read the English languaee. and then submit proof of his being a competent person, under the immigra tion laws, Jo apply for citizenship. A repre sentative or the Government will be present at the proceedings, to watch the case on behalf of the United States, and if need be to bring counter-evidence against the applicant. If the Judge is satisfied with the shoving made by the applicant, he will issue to him a certificate of judgment to that effect, and admit him to the rights and privileges or citizenship. Mr. Oates believes that by this means the quality of Immigration to this country will be raised, and the dlmlte- nf iitlryitiin in its United States be enhanced. TO 

HEAD OFF THE BE1TISH, Wharton Barker Will Try to Organise an American Syndicate. Phh-Uelphia, December?. The apparent Buccess which bas attended the organization ot the London corporations to transact business in England and the TJnited States has inspired Wharton Barker to attempt a similar under taking. Under date of December 4 that gen tleman Issued type-written letters to a number ot Phlladelphians stating that he had associated with him a number of influential capitalists who proposed forming a banking and trading company under the En glish .liability act, to conduct business in Europe and America, and asking the gentle man addressed to oail at his office, where the plans will be unfolded. A number of gentle men interviewed yesterday had a vivid recol lection of Mr. Barker's Chinese schemes, and tbeyhad not availed themselves of the privi lege of getting on the ground floor ot the latest enterprise. The liability act to which Mr. Barker refers limits the liability of stockholders to the amount of stock held by each, while the liability In this country Is for the amount of the stock' and as mnch more. Thnnrlnr.inlftnf tho V.n. cliih law is to limit the liability of stockholders. very mnch as the liability of partners is re stricted in Pennsylvania by tbe statute pro viding for the organization of limited partner ships. Mr. 'Barker nronoap maV a th -.- outstrip in capltaf any financial institution In this country. He expects to have the total capital mopaooo, one-half of which will be placed In England and the other half will be offered to Americans. Offices will be estab lished in the leading European cities, and an advisory board will include such prominent men In England and In New York, Philadel phia and Chicago as may be induced to lend the scheme their support. Barker Brothers & Co., of this city, are to be the principal American agents. IT WAB 'TOO EOT FOE HIM.

By and by she turned her face again, to meet the same breadth of smile and the eyes fixed steadily on her face. She looked annoyed. He looked aellghted. Her cheeks grew pink. She had half a mind to change her seat; Then all the bravery in ber nature mounted to her eyes. Slowly she drew from her pocket a lorgnette, and held it with the most deliberate Inquisitive ness up to her eyes.; First she scanned the top of his hat, then slowly ohl so slowly let her gaze creep down ward to his face with its wealth of smile, her own never changing by the quiver Ot a muscle. Down, down it went, with flxod and stony sure, to the very tips of his boots. There it paused for an instant; then began its slow upward march, creeolng along with the same curious deliberation, very much as one would survey a new variety of animal with a view to classification. When she reached tbe smile again the glory of it was dimmed. When she reached tbe toes they were decidedly uneasy, and by the time She was ready to scan his face oh her upward sweep it looked very red and decidedly uncom fortable. One more sweeping circuit was made, and the discomfited "masher," mutter ing something about tbe car's being too hot for him, fled from the awful presence and plunged down the stairs into the street below. A K0TEL BUREAU. An Idea Which a Bright Woman Made Use of Tery Prontnbly. From the New York Tribune.: If some bright, clever woman wants to confer a lasting blessing on unhappy man and at the same, time open for herself a short road road to fortune, let her establish a bureau and agency for Christmas and holiday shopping. Some place where a man may go and say to an intelligent woman for only a woman understands the mysterious secret of buying Christmas presents "Here is a check forSSO. Buy me something suitable for my wife, my sister or my daughters." The system might be so perfected that one could fill in blanks as one does for a postofQce order. Say the man goes in, fills In the amount, the person for whom the gift is intended, the age, tb- relationship, etc He gets a receipt for his check and order, and at a certain time tbe package is delivered at bis office lor his ap proval and the collection of the commission on the transaction. A man Is not a Success at shopping. He gen erally rushes into a place, nervously tosses over a dozen or more things, buys Something in a hurry, tears away to bis business, and gradu ally wakens to the fact that he has not bought the thing he wanted. There is ho patent on this Idea, and any woman of the right kind is heartily welcome to It Good SnbJcts to Attack. from the Providence Journal.'!

ICOBBXSrONDZSCI Or THE DISPATCH.l Washington, D. C, December a There are plenty of people tosay "I told you so," la re gard to the moral lapse of Cashier Silcott, ot the office of Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives but it is probable that a sus picion of the man's honesty never entered the head of one of his acquaintances until tbe scandal burst from the clear sky ot yesterday morning. If anybody onzht to have suspected him, it was his superior officer, his employer; In fact. Sergeant at Arms Leedom, who knew his habits; but it is really so common in this at mosphere for a gentleman In office to do a little Sporting and to have a wife sinister, that tbe fact does not occasion anxiety. Silcott "played the races," but so do thousands of other good men whose income Is no more than his. Mr. Leedom himself wat an enthusiastic patnon of the pools, and probably lost as much money as Silcott did, bnt he was abler to stand It and did not have to fall back on a grand breach of trust when he found himself getting short in pocket. It Is one of the astonishing features of Jbcb cases that a man in a position of such high pecuniary responsibility can go the lenght bra zenly that Silcott did,and yet arouse no alarm In the minds of those who are in a'position to suffer from his malfeasance. It seems to have become so'-common a thing for a man to spend more than he makes that it excites no com ment, and no one seems to reflect that when he does so he must be robbing somebody. Mem bers of Congress, citizens, fellow officials, who were in a position talcnow the lavish expend itures of Silcott at tbe race track and at "Monte Carlo," officials who were hit idtimate companions in his more reczless escapades, all Of whom knew that he bandied money, often more than a hundred thousand at a time, never thought to sound a note of warning, or even to protect themselves against probable robbery. And now it is probable that the Congress will Step In and make the people pay for the negligence of members, and the blindness and carelessness ot Silcott's employer and his fel low officials, and thus contribute to the dead enjoyments ot this sensational defaulter. , An Unhealthy Moral Atmosphere. After all it was not the race track nor the woman In the case that ruined Silcott It was the atmosphere of Washington. There is some thing in the1 social air that quickens a man's pace. It is a city of social abandon, of Intel lectual friction, of Intense concentration and its opposite of extreme relaxation. Ona'sacts are construed more liberally here than else where within reach of the home of the Puri tans, and men of the most dignified and cir cumspect conduct at home are not criticised here If they indulge in a temporary season of dissipation. Some are made stronger morally by snch experience, paradoxical as that may seem, but a majority who eat of the forbidden fruit never recover from the effects. As long ago as my memory goes back I can recall tbe spectacle of brilliant men wrecked by a season of official life at this capital. Since my earliest youth they have been always cross ing my path. In my brief residence here I have seen many come fresh and strong from their own people and retire after a short time broken to pieces by the excesses that seemed to them to be a natural accompaniment ot the new life. Doubtless It only proved that they were not at all strong morally, and that It needed but op portunity and a little encouragement to wreck them. It is a fine Stndv for the moralist and psychologist the ease with which the most ex emplary men drop from their hleh moral estate when example and opportunity are first put forcibly before their eyes. Several Noted Defaulters. The defalcation of Silcott is by all odds tbe most sensational that has occurred since the handsome and popular Captain Howgate stole a hundred thousand or so of the public funds. Howgate was In jail for awhile, but one day was kindly permitted to escape by an officer who accompanied him to his residence to secure a change of clothes, just as thomrb his clothing could not have been brought to him. Though it has alwavs been suspected that numerous people of Washington were well aware of the whereabouts of the Captain, and among them members of the police, he is still at large, but whether comfortable and happy I cannot say. Another noted defalcation was that of Pay master Hodges of the army, also for a large amount Hodges was tried and convicted, and I believe, pardoned. If I am not mistaken I saw him on tbe street the other day, looking well and as though In a condition of affluence. Ben rjalleck'a Boodle. One of the most noted robberies that ever occurred in this city was that ot Ben Halleck, who carried off no less than 195,000 of Treasury money at a single load. He was a clerk in the cash room ot tbe Treasury, and one day when a vast amount was being loaded on an express wagon for transportation, Ben carried this amount in one bundle, most ot it In 1500 bills, out and away, right under the eyes of the clerks, watchmen and police. He passed it along to "Peg-leg Brown," a well-known sport ing character, who turned It over to a keeper ot a restaurant, of which Brown was a constant patron. Ottman. the saloon keener, shoved some of it and Brown skipped with the remainder, and was caught at Saratoga while attempting to pass one of the bills. All three were arrested, but not until Ottman and Brown had bad a good deal ot fun with the money, none of which, however, was enjoyed by poor Halleck. Caroline Becker's Cuteness. I think it was a man named Connelly who stole a large amount from the Redemption Di vision ot the Treasury Department, in the shape ot old hills turned in for redemption and maceration; but tbe cutest affair of that kind that has ever happened was the theft of no one Knows how much, by Caroline Becker. This was of recent occurrence. la the presence of other clerks, and with only portions of bills to operate with, Mrs. Becker pieced together thousands of dollars without the fractions being missed by the keenest-eyed clerks of the entire civil service. How she managed to do it Without discovery is one of the mysteries that It a constant subject of wonder among tbo em ployes of the department, and a yet daily query Is as to the amount the woman got Wore Diamonds While at Work. Herdwas another case of notable blindness on the part of the acquaintance of the mlsdoer. Becker wore magnificent diamonds to her dally work, which she performed for a salary of 575 a month. She explained this by the story that a rich aunt had died and left her tbe gems. She bought houses worth thousands eacb, and was erecting a fine country residence when, oy a mere-accident one day when she was not at work, portion ot a bill told the story of the theft Hers will doubtless remain for a lung time one of tbe strabgest of tbe cu rious crimes committed in the pnblio service at the Capital. A Crime Sever Committed. One of the robberies that did not take place was that which never got any farther than tho brain of a sensational correspondent of a sensa tional newspaper. He had secured crows and jimmies enough to make a formidable display, and arranged to strew them one night In the court ot the Treasury at a time when the exca vation was about finished for the new silver vaults. His plan was to place them there and then by a series of terriflo explosions, alarm the treasury watch and the whole city at that time of night when none but tbe Initiated, that is himself and bis confederates, would be about that is, after all the other correspondents bad gone home, when he would easily hare a "beat" ot the attempt to rob the vaults. A Herniation Spoiled. On tbe day previous to that on which he In tended to spring the sensation he was dismissed from his papor "by telegraph" on account of a sensation involving a Senator, which, being without foundation, was too extreme for even the usually inexhaustable appetites for that sort Of thing of the editors in the home office.
