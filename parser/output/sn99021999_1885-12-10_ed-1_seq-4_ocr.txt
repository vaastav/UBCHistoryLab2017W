CHICAGO canning company has sue cocdcd in introducing American dressed nieatH into Franco , and has secured a contract to furnish S.-'OD.ODO pounds' for the French"army. . This contract was flcyiirod with considerable diiliuiilty as the projndicoH of the French had to bo overcome , and was only doao after tv most thorough analysis of our meats. It may bo roganlod as an ImpurHnl vic tory , as the Fronoh have hithurto given thole moat contracts to other countries. This will probably bo the moans of crea ting a now market for Amorloan beef.

Tlio AVront ; Meat Market. A copy of tlio c.ill for a convention at Kan sas City , Dee. U9 , to consider Missouri river improvement , hasb cn ipculveil by Tlio Her ald , iimllrd to it presumably in expeit.itiou nfa free ndvcitlsoaiont. Well , it will jjntlt. Thuconvolition will inei-laiid will be attended by the usual number ol' wull-ineaiilnij citi zens and the * usual nnmbor of tro.isury plun- dc'icts.

The Herald is jiretty well educated on this topic of MMoitrl river iniprovements. It is a delusion and a snare , a swindle upon tliu ( 'oveniiacnl , an or 'iinl/uil system of plunder. The Mls-onii river cannot l > o linpmvud , and wouldn't bo worth a ems to anybody if it could. Hcrtitd. There is no doubt that the parties who mailed the formal call for the Missouri river convention to the Herald have made a serious blunder. If , as is inti mated by that sheet , their object w as to get a free advertisement , they wont to the wrong market for their meat. AH an advertising medium Iho Ifcntlil fails lamentably in keeping up with the pro cession. If the aim was to awaken an interest in the oll'ort to secure cheap transportation by improving the western waterways , the friends of the movement had nothing better to oxpoot than abuse and ridicule from an organ whose chief conductor made it his boast before the bonato com- mllteo on commerce that ho glorlod in wearing tlio brass collar of the railroad monopolies. Nobody familiar with the policy of the Herald will bo surprised at its attack. It Is in full keeping with its recent false statement that Major Sutor , in his report lo the waroUioo , had placed himself flatly in opposition to all further appropriations for improving tlio Mis souri river. When , in duo course o time , Iho board of I ratio and leading business men of Omaha forward petitions to our ilolcga. lion in congress requesting them to u.su Iliolr inlluonoo and give tluur vigorous support to bills appropriating money for improving the river , wo shall , as usual , liid among those names those of Miller & ISiolutrdson , proprietors of the llcrulit. I'll is will only bo in accord witli the otur- nil lltnoss of ihingn. Thu paper will .lononucu Iho river improvement as a inure and a swindle und the proprietors ivlll endorse it as a measure of great public necessity which our senators and wiigressmon are hi duty bound lo sus- aln. It is because the Herald has oiou- : > iod such contradictory attitudes that it ins never been u llrat-olass advertising ui'dium in those parts. 

NATOII.VI , gas has boon discarded In Cleveland and a well U.HO feet deep has Kcn ! driven to secure a steady How , If ho gas is no better than that furnished o the citi/ons of Omaha , thu well should bo promptly plugged up. Tin ; action of thu city authorities of . 'rovidonco in refusing to grant any more iodises for roller-skating rinks is ere. i ling considerable comment , and the im- uvAsloii is that this reform wave Is liahlo o spread all over the country. It is a lotorious fact that roller-bleating rinks invn been pie luctlve of more scandals mil the ruination of more young girls hau any other oausu known for many years In Providence the uinyor had careful investigation made , and the r suit convinced him that roller r'mk.s wei not conducive to morality. The snmo i in all probability , true In regard I rinks in other cities. Omaha , p rhap is a notable exception , as roller-.skatiu rinks have not nourished hero to an great extent , and as yet no public scan dal has been created by them , althotig there may have boon a few private scar dais. This speaks well for the moralil of Omaha , which , wo believe , is muc higher than the average morality c eastern cilic.s. Tlio Prcoldcnt and Silver. President Cleveland'.s advice to congress gross on the silver question i ? not llkcl , to bo followed in the present session While Iho party leaders on both sides o the house are prepare1. ! lo modify cxisl ing legislation in order to increase th value of the silver dollar and proven further depreciation In the coinage , the , will hardly dare to plant themselves 01 ground which declares for a stoppage o the silver coinage and a practien demonetization of silver in the Unltei Slates. This would bo the certain result if Mr. Cleveland's policy In regard ti silver should bo followed by congress However muchyuoh apian may bo on dor.sed by "loading bankers , " It nipct with prompt dissent from the vast ma jority of voters in the country. There have been two causes of ( lie con tinned depreciation of silver and Us failure uro to circulate under the coinage act o 1878 , and both can bo controlled b ; proper legislation. The first cause i that the government has stamped a falst value on the dollar coined in Iho mint She second is that proper ollbrts hu\c not been made to seotiro its circulation The idea that the people are prejudiced against silver as silver is preposterous If the silver dollar was what it is repre sented to bo , a dollar's worth of silver , loss the cost of coiningand "seigniorage,1 the prejudice would quickly vanish. So long as Iho one and two dollar bills are retained in the currency people will prefer thorn to the hoaviei metal. If the government had retired seven years ago all notes under the value of $5 , we should hear less now about the vast accumulations of silver dollars in the vaults of the treasury. Mr Clorehu d is careful to note that no damage appears yet to have boon done by the continued coinage of silver , but that danger is apprehended from a turlher continuance of the coinage. Tliu apprehension of danger is chiolly con- lined to the loaning class iu the cast- \Vith an honest dollar under some such act as that advocated by Mr. Dorshoimcr in the Forty-sixth congress , all appre hension of danger would be removed. With the retirement of the small treasury notes and the decrease in bank circula tion which is still in progress , there will bo ample room for the use of whatever silver the government may issue. The trouble has been that every ad. ministration since the passage of the coinage act has been hostile to the retention of silver as a part of our national currency , and the treasury de partment has obstructed so far as possi ble the nnim < > sdod circulation of the sil ver dollar. Mr. Cleveland places him self on still more radical ground than any of his predecessors in demanding a method of dealing with silver whicli.it' adopted , will inevitably'do troy a double standard in this couatry. Whatever other countries may have done , wo are uot yet prepared to demonetize ouo of Iho most valuable products of our mines and the chiuf circulating medium of our people. The maintenance of a silver Roinago seems to dum mil an increase in the weight of the dollar , and congress is ready to listen to such a proportion , and to debate its advantages and disavun- tagos. But any proposition for an entire uessation of the silver coinage will m jut with certain defeat , as it should , at the hands of the representatives of the poo- [ ilo. Tlio VlailuciH. The council very properly passed nn ordinance last week requiring plans to be Irawn for a viaduct on Tenth street and lirecting the mayor to appointappraisers ) f damages on both Tenth and Kloventh streets. Mayor Hoyd has made the ap- | ) ointmontsand'wo shall soon prick the nibble whioh opponents of the Tenth rtroot viaduct have blown. The idea ,1ml the damages to Tenth street proper- iybythe construction of 11 viaduot will imount to $ .

If the via- luct goes on Kloventh street it .vouldn't . bring $1,10,03 , ) , The property lorth of the vladmit , north of Hnrnuy , vould depreciate more than the value of ho whole property under the viaduct , I'hu appraisers are oxpoetod to consider ho damages und thu buiiuliU of the niprovement , just as is done in tipprnis' ng damages caused by the gra ling of n ilroot whioh outs in 'front of some lots md fills in front of others. The oll'cct ipon the lots of leveling the ground and nuking tjio street payable is always a actor to bo lakun into 'ionsideratlon. ' If i viaduct is built ever Tenth stri-ot it vill continue to bo a thor- uighfaro and will justify the loavy outlay for paving and trading , which has already boon mado. f It goes on Klovonth street , Tenth will 'irlually ' bo closed for travel and llio real 'State which Is now rated as good retail irope ty , would bo plastered all ever dlh signs , "To Rent. " The wholesale iropurty will not bo tifToctcd materially no way ov the other , but its saleable ; ilmi must largely dupond upon the aluo of lots below or above. Values re always relative and the bhrinkago in outs on the main portion of the street , -ould have a depressing oll'eet upon the I'holo t-troot. All experience shows that ravel will follow the viaduoU and do- reuse of travel means decrease of busi * ess , In Chicago tmd Milwau- ce it has been proved bo- end a question that the build- ig of viaductsTSO far from depreciating ropurty on strouts.ovon where it was lo- ated way below , has Increased matcri- liy the value of all adjacent real es-tuto. Incure'tv. ' tUoccitulnty that a vi.idiu will l > o built' ov or tstth Sixtccut street has douliled t'ho value of proper ! nil along that Ihoroughturo to the oil limits , and it is stilt advancing.
