T?E3DAT EVENING. DEO. 8, 1901 11 -_L" irr",,,:.. Pkxsiobnt Roosevelt's first mes eaga to Congres? waa read in both house? today. It 1? a long document, but Is conservative lo ita tone through? out. As may have bean expected, much of it is optimistic and ita deduc? tions are made from a republican stand? point. His recommendations in the maio are doubtless in order notr that the United States have creased tbe Rubicon and started on an imperialist? ic career. Of course suob ? transition in the form of government calls for ad? ditional departments, increased navy ?nd tbe expenditure of millions where a third of ? century ago thousands would have sufficed. Tbere is nothing striking in the message. It deals with public affairs in a manner to which oo special objections can be urged under changed conditions of the country. Tbere seeme to be but ooe real protest ?and that doubtless comes from both parties?it is too long. In this day when few have the time to read long documente aod an equally email num? ber have not the inclination, it would be well for publlo men to act npon the motto, Muitum in parvo. Few, how? ever, do bo, and tbe verbosity of repre? sentatives and leaden io politice and religions thought are seldom epigram? matic. Rkv Daniel Halloban, pastor of Oraoe Methodist Episcopal Church, New York, appeared at tbe Garden Theatre last Sunday afternoon aod made en address oppoetog the efforts of the Women's Christian Temperance TJolon of New York to secure the pardon of Libby Garrabrant, who has been in State prison tor thirty years for the poisoning of ? man with whom abe was living. This is toother osse where a temperaooe organization and a minister of tbe gospel are at varlanoe from the faot that both are meddling with the authorities who never asked the advice of either. The former is endeavoriog to cause a miscarriage of justice aod tbe latter seema to have forgotten his call? ing and plunged loto an issue with wbioh he had nothiog to do. In his case it is but necessary to quote a pas? sage from the sermon on the mount, while it can be observed that the mem? bers of the association referred to are not called on to interfere or Intercede in oases where courts have made ex? haustive examinations and acted on their beet judgment. Bkpbksbntativk Dick, of Ohio, has Introduced a resolution changing the date for tbe inauguration of Presidents from March 4 to April ?0. Tbe date selected by General Dick Is the one on which General George Washington was first ioaugurated President of the United States. It Is earnestly hoped that the change will be made before ?oother President is ioaugurated. Maroh is an uopropitioos aod to many ? dangerous month, aod numbers con? tract colds every time a President Is ieduoted Into ofiioe, and in many casca they prove fatal. There was a verit? able blizzard on the 4tb of Maroh, 1873, the day President Grant was inaugu? rated the second time, and numbers j ruined their health by expoeiog them? selves to tbe weather durtog the cere? monies oo tbat occasion. ???? 3,000 bills "were Introduced lo tne House yeeterday.

Tbe President'? message left the White House shortly after 11:30 o'clock this morning and started on ite journey to the Capitol. Secretary Proden and Executive Clerk Young were the hearer? of the message. All the mts nta.ee carried to the Capitol were print? ed. Only two, tbat for tbe Senate and that for the House of Repr?sentative?, were signed by tbe President with pen and ink; tbe others merely bore bis printed name.

He said tbat two bills on the subject would be introduced by bim. The first of these would be to appropriate sufficient money to secure necessary oonoeeeione from Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Tbe second would be to provide for tbe con? struction of the canal itself over tbe Nioaragoan route. One of the most interesting subjects of discussion among tbe northwestern members of Congress is the prospect ot action by Congress for tbe purpose of preventing consummation of tbe four hundred million Northern Securities deal. It is declared tbat some steps to this end will soon be taken. Emb?rr?s?ment to the republican party is believed to be tho inevitable result of tbe de? cision of the supreme Court yesterday in tbe Philippine cases. On the advice of Senator Aldrieb, the House committee on ways and means will, ai aooo as possible, introduce a ioint resolution extending lbs Dingley rates of tariff to all goods coming from the Philip? pine?. It i? reported tbat in order to eeouio | action at tbe earlieit possible date Speaker Henderson will appoint the new ways and means committee of tbe Home before the Christmas recess. In order to conform to previous decisions of tbe Supreme Court, tbe resolution will have to provide, as was done in tbe Porto Bican case, that the revenues col? lected both in tbe Philippines and at United Sums ports on goods passing between tbe United Suites and the Philippines shall be ap? plied to local uses in the Archipelago. They cannot be covered iato tbe United States Treasury.

FIFTY-SEVENTH C0NGRES?S. Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. SENATS. Tbe appearance of the Senate this morning wae striking in ite simplicity and sombernese.

In the House of Representatives yes? terday Mr. Dalzell offered the resolu? tion agreed to by the republican caucus on Saturday for the adoption of tbe rules of tbe last House, with certain specified amendments, as tbe rules of the present House. Mr. Rlcbardeon inquired whether opportunity was to be given to offer amendments, and on receiving a nega? tive reply be protested against suob action. He said he desired to oiler some amendments which he thought would prevail if th?? gentleman from Iowa (Hepburn) oo lid deliver tbe 40 votes which the newspapers had said he had in the republican cauous lest Saturday. Mr. Dalzill said the proceeding was similar to that taken in the last Con? gress. He pointed ont tbat tbe rulee were practically identical with those of tbe Fifty-first, Fifty-fourth and succeed? ing Congresses and practically identical with those of tbe intervening democrat? ic Congresses. He then yielded five minutes to Mr. Richardeon, who occu? pied tbe time in denouncing tbe rule??. While Mr. Richardson was speaking of Mr. Hepburn's 40 followers Mr. Steele countered by asking if tbe Mo? Clellan r?solut oa offered at tbe demo? cratic caucus last Saturday would command forty votes on the democrat lo side. Mr. Hepburn said that hie views on the subject of the rules had been enter? tained by bim for many years. He bad even attempted to secure tneir modifi? cation in the Fifty-tbird Congress, which was democratic, and upon that occasion Mr. Richardson himself had bitterly opposed the change. '? bave suffirent modesty when I find that tbe democrats are against me and aleo a majority of my own party, to feel tbat I must mistrust tbe wisdom of my own conclut-ion." Mr, Swauson, of Virginia, demanded tbe reading of tbe rules, but was re? fused, after a spirited parley, and a standing vote for the previous ques? tion resulted 192 to 149. Mr. Hepburn did not vote at all. Then tbe demo? crats started to filibuster by demand? ing tellers, wbioh resulted in a yea and nay vote oo the previous queatioo and a yea and nav vote on tbe motion to recommit.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's message to Congreee was read today. It is one of tbe most bulky documents ever sent to Congress by a Pr?sident, and makes a pamplet of forty-six pages. The President begins the document by saying that Congreee assemblee this year under the shadow of a great calam? ity and calls attention to the fact tbat on tbe eiztb of September President McKinley was shot by an anarcblat while attending the Pan-American Exposition at B?rlelo, and died in tbat city oo tbe fourteenth of tbat month. "Of the last seven elected Presidents,'" the President says, "he is tbe third wbo bas beeo murdered, aod tbe bare re? cital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal Amerioao citizens." Mr. Roosevelt then devotee several pages of the message to tbe life and public services of tbe late President MoKtcley aod concludes that the blow was aimed at American institutions by the assassin. He dwells at length oo tbe anarchistic doctrines of the present day, and concludes tbat oo man or body of meo preaching anarobistic doc? trines should be allowed at large any more than if preachiog the murder of some specified private individual and that anarchistio speeches, writings, and meetings are easentialiy seditious and treasonable. Continuing the President makes sundry recommendations as to the manner of keeping such characters out of the country aod eays; "Tbe federal courts should be given juris diction over any man wbo kills or at? tempts to kill the President or an; man wbo by the constitution or by law Is in line of succession for tbe Presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be pro? portioned to tbe enormity of tbe of? fense against our Institutions. Anar? chy is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankind ebould band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an oflenee against tbe law ol nations, like piracy and tbat form ol maoetealingknown as the slave trade; for it is ol far blacker infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Suob treaties would give to tbe federal government tbe power of dealing with the crime. * * * This great coun? try will not fall into anarchy, and ? anarchiste ebould ever become a eeri ous menace to Its I istitutions, tbey would Involve In their owo ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines. The American people are slow to wratb, but when their wrath is one ? kindled it burns like a consuming flame." The President next makes an ex? haustive review of the business of the country and congratulates tbe Uoited States upon tbe prevailing prosperity as seen through republican spectacles and, of course, attributes it all to tbe methods of tbe administration aod ssye it is oot true that as tbe riob bave grown richer tbe poor hive growo poorer. On tbe contrary he avers thai never before has the average man, the wage-worker, tbe farmer, tbe small trader, been so well oli as In tbis coun? try and at tie present time. He acknowledges tbat tbere have been abuses connected w tb the accumula? tion of wealth; yet he ?ye it remains true that a fortune accumulated in legiti? mate business can be accumulated by tbe person specially benefltted only on con? dition of conferring immense incidental oentfits upon otbei?. Mr. Roosevelt enters into an exhaustive review of the growth of the Uoited States and possibilities yet to be attain? ed by tbe country aod eays : ''The captains of Industry wbo have driven'he railway systems across this continent, who have built up our com? merce, wbo bave developed our manu? factures, bave on the whole done great good to our people. Without them tbe material development of wbloh we are so justly proud could never have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the immenee importance to this ma? terial development of leaving as un? hampered as Is compatible with tbe public good tbe strung and foroeful men upon whom the success of business operations inevitably rests. The slight? est study of business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a judgment tbat the personal equation Is the most important factor In a business operation; tbat the business ability 01 tbe man at the head of any business concern, big or little, U usually the factor wbicb fixes tbe gulf between Hirikiug success and hopeless failure. An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be found in tbe International commercial conditions of today. Tbe same busi? ness conditions which have produoed the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors in International commercial competition. Basinets con? cerns which bave tbe largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are naturally those wbicb take the lead io tbe etrife for com? men?ai supremacy among tbe nations of tbe world. America has only just begun to assume that commanding position in the international business world wbich we believe will more and more be hers. It Is of the utmost im? portance tbat this position be not jaop arded, especially at a time when tbe overflowing abundance of our owo nat? ural resources aod the skill, business energy, and meobanlcal aptitude of oar people make foreign markets eeeeotlal. Under such conditions it would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter tbe youthful strength of our nation. More* over, It cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with ignorant violence at tbe interests of one set of men almost inevitably endangers tbe interests of all. Tbe fundamental rule in our national life?tbe rule wbich underlies all others?is tbat, oo the whole, aod io the long run, we shall go op or down together, * * ? The mechanism of modern business is so delicate tbat ex? treme care must be taken oot to inter? fere witb it io a spirit of rashness or iguoraoce. Many of those who have made it their vocation to denounce tbe great industrial combinations which are popularly, although witb technical inaccuracy, known as "truste," appeal especially to hatred and fear. These are precisely the two emotions, partic? ularly when combined with Ignorance, wbicb unfit men lor the exercise of cool and steady judgment. Io facing new industrial conditions, tbe whole his? tory of tbe world shows that l?gisla? tion will generally be both unwise aod ineffective unlees undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self restraint. Much of the legislation di? rected at the traste would have beeo exceedingly mischievous bad it oot also beeo entirely ioeflective, yet it is also true tbat there are real and grave evils, one cf the chief beleg over-capitaliza? tion because of its many baleful con? sequences; ?nd % regolate end practical effort muet be made to correct these evils. There li ? widespread convic? tion in tbe minile of the American peo? ple that tbe great corporations known as truste are in certain of their features ?nd tendencies hurtful to tbe general welfare. Tbl? springs from no spirit of envy or uocbaritableneae, nor lack of pride in tbe great industrial achieve? ments tbat have placed tbis country at the bead of tbe nations struggling for commercial supremacy. It is no limita? tion upon property rights or freedom of contract to require teat wben men receive from government tbe privilege of doing business under corporate form, which frees tbem from individual re? sponsibility, and enables tbem to call Into tbeir enterprises tbe capital of tbe the pabilo, tbey sball doso upon abso? lutely tratbfal representations as to tbe vaine of tbe property In which tbe capi? tal ia to be invested, Corporations en? gaged in interstate commerce should be regulated If they are found to exercise a lioense working to tbe public injury. Great corporations exist only because tbey are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and it is therefore our right and our doty to see that tbey work in harmony wltb these institu? tions. The first eeaeotial in determin? ing how to deal with tbe great lndue trial combinations is knowledge of tbe facts?publicity. In the interest of tbe public, tbe government should bave tbe right to inspect and examine tbe work? ings of tbe great corporations engaged in interstate business. Wbat further remedies are needed in the way of gov ermental regulation, or taxation, can only be determined after publicity bee been obtained, by process of law, and In the coaree of admini-tration. Tne first requisite is knowledge, fall and oomplete?knowledge which may be mede public to the world." Further on tbe President says : "Wben the constitution was adopted no human wisdom could foretell tbe sweep? ing changes, alike in industrial and po? litical conditions, wbioh were to take place by tbe beginning of tbe twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a matter of course tbat the several States were tbe proper authorities to regalate, so far as wae then neoeestry, the comparatively insignificant aod strictly localized corporate bodies of the day, Tbe conditions are no? wholly different and wholly different lotion is called for. I believe that a law oan be framed whiob will enable tbe uational government to exercise coo trol along the lines above indicated; profiling by tbe experience gainea through tbe passage and admlolstratlou of tbe Interstate commerce act. If, bowever, the judgment of the Congress is tbat it lacks the constitutional power to pa?? such an act, then a constitution? al amendment should be submitted to confer tbe power. There should be created a Cabinet offloer, to be known ?s Secretary of Commerce and Induc? irles, as provided in tbe bill introduced at tbe last session of tbe Congress. I shoald be his province to deal wltb commerce In its broadest sense; includ ing ?mong many otber things whatever concerne labor and all matters atleotiug the great business corporations and our merchant marine." The President then passes on to tbe farming Interests and the wage-workers and views conditions optimistically from a republican st todpolnt, aod says: "Not only most our labor be protected by tbe tariff, but it should aleo be protected so far as it is possible from tbe presence in this country of any laborers brought over by contract, or of those who, com? ing freely, yet represent a standard ot living so depressed,that tbey oan under? sell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard it as necessary, with tbis end in view, to re-enact Immediately the law ex? cluding Chineee laborers andto strength en It wherever necessary in crder to make Its enforoement entirely effec? tive." Some suggestions as to tbe amend? ments to tbe present immigration laws are made by tbe President, after which be piases on to the tariff, and says: 'There is a general acquiescence io oar present tariff system as a national policy. Tbe first requisite to our pros? perity is the continuity and stability of this ?conomie policy. Nothing could be more unwise tban to disturb tbe busloess interests of tbe country by any general tariff change at tbis time." "Reciprocity," tbe President says, "muet be treated as tbe baodmaiden of protection. Our first duty is to see tbat the protection granted by the tariff in every case where it is needel is main? tained, and tbat reoiprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home indus? tries. Just how far this is most be de? termined according to the individuai case, remembering always tbat every application of our tariff policy to meet oar shifting national needs must be conditioned npon tbe cardinal fact tbat tbe duties must never be reduced below the point tbat will cover tbe difference between the labor cost here aod abroad. The well-being of the wage-worker is a prime consideration of oar entire policy of economi? legislation. Subject to this proviso of tbe proper protection neces? sary to oar industrial well.being at home, tbe principle of reciprocity most command oar hearty support.'' Mr. Roosevelt reviews tbe shipping Interests of tbe country and asks im? mediate remedial actioo by Congres? in order tbat the merobant marine may assume proportions commensurate witb the country's growth and that the United States may not he compelled to rely upon foreign vev.-Js to transport Ita products. In bis referenee to monetary affairs the President says: "Tbe act of March 14, 1900, intend unequivocally to es? tablish gold aa the standard money aod to maintain at a parity therewith all forme of money medium in use witb us, has been shown to be timely aod jadioioue. Tbe prim of our govern? ment bonds In the world's market, when compared wltb the price of simi? lar obligation? ??sued by otber nations, Is a flattering tribute to oar public credit. This condition it Is evidenly desirable to maintain." The President urge? strict economy in publio expenditures and euugeets certain equitable amendments to the interstate commerce laws. A large portloa of toe message is de? voted to matters wbicb oonie under tbe eapervlaioo of the Department of Agri? culture. Among otber things he ad? vise? wise measures oonoerniog forest protection and tbe encouragement ol all branches of agriculture. Concerning the country's new posies sloes be says : "Io Hawaii our aim mast b? to develop tbe territory oo tbe traditional American lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cbeap labor; we wish a healthy Ameri? can community of meo wbo themselves till tbe farms they own. All oar legis? lation for the Ulaods should be shaped with this end lo view; tbe well-being of the average home-maker must afford the tras test of the healthy deve'ep meot of the islands. Tbe laod policy -boold as nearly as possible be modeled oo oar homestead system. It is a pletsure to say that it is hardly more necee-ary to report ae to Porto Rico iban ae to aoy State or Territory with? in our continental limite. The Island is thriving as never before, and it is belog administered effioieotly aod honestly. Its people are oow eujoyiog liberty aod order under tbe protection of the Uoited S.ates aod apon this fact we congratulate tbem and ourselves. Their material welfare most be as care lolly aod jealously considered as tbe welfare ol any other portioo of our country. We have given them tbe gteat gift of free access for tbelr pro? ducts to tbe markets of tbe Uoited Statee. I ask the attention of the Con? gress to tbe oeed of legislation ooocero log tbe public lauds of Porto Rico. In Cuba luoh progreaa haa bean made towatd putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing that btfoie tbe preeeut session of the Congreaa cloeea tbla will be an aocompllabed fact. Cubo will tbea statt aa her own mittrev ; and to the beautiful Qneen of tbe Amulet, aa> abeunfolda tbU new page of her deatiny, we extend oir heut oat greeting and good withea. Ia the ear? of tuba, there are weighty leeaoaa of morality and of national interest why the reci? procity policy should be held to bave a peca? liar application, and I moat earnestly aak yoar attention to the wirdom, indetd to tbe vital need, of providing lor a aubttantial re? duction in the tariff dotte? on Cuban imports Into the United State?. * ? * tjur attitade toward Cuba ia a sufficient guar? anty of our own good faith.
