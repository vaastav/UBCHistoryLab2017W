Of the United States Quarries and Granite Construction Co., of Bane. A. M. Hunt, editor and publisher of "Granite," in tha December issue of that publication has the following to say of a local concern: "We have had many inquiries regard ing this concern, and from those who apparently are endeavoring to get at the bottom of the facts regarding it; and for this reason that we find , such a general interest among; the trade, we consider it incumbant upon ourselves to publish, what we have found up to the present time. "Our first attention was drawn to this concern by the notices of its in corporation under the laws of the State of Maine, which notice stated that this company was incorporated with, a cap ital of '$600,000 We cannot recall the names of (tie incorporators, but none of the naniwsj were familiar to us. This company was again drawn to our at tention by the full page advertisements which they were carrying in the Barre Pally Times. The advertisement-which we saw carried the recommendation of two of the leading bauks in Rarre. We wrote to the banks asking for informa tion about the concern. One bank did not answer; the other one stated that I he, the cashier, had not authorized the use of the nenie of the tmnk in the ad vertisement, but possibly some 'of . the directors had. In ---'conversation with the cashier of the other bunk, to whom we wrote, he stated ttat he knew nothing further than that Mr. J. B. Campbell bad been a former resident of Barre and that he came from Chicago well recommended to them. "At the time this company started in Barre, it was stated that they had a contract for a sixteen iMory building, to be erected, in Chicago,! of granite, t'p to date we have been unable to defi nitely locate this building, and as far as we have been able to ascertain, there has been no attempt to cut the building from granite. "We interviewed Mr, Campbell on a recent visit to Barre. By the way, the office of this company is located on the ground floor of one of the best build ings in that section, and is very nicely furnished' for an office representing quarry interests. At the time of our visit we could not ' ascertain from Mr. Campbell that anything definite had been dime. YVe were told that they had secured control of the so-called YVhit comb i Bond quarrying property. YVe were requested not to say anything about it, but since our interview this has been, published in the daily paper, and we assume it w no longer a secret. It is also stated that this company had secured the control of certain properties, on which there are a deposit, of granite, and that, the company would commence quarryipg at once. YY"e cannot learn, however, that they have commenced quarrying, but they may have dne so. A recent statement in a local paper was to the effect that thk company bad secured a contract for a dock, one quarter mile long, and dam to I erec ted in Conneytieut. YSe have been un able, -up to date, to ascertain where either the dock or the dam is located. We have before us a, circular letter, is sued by this enmB-a&y, under kte of Nov. 17th. The beading, in part., reads as follows: "Largest Quarries in the World," We assume this may refer to Barre, Y'L, having the largest quarries in the world, but it is not a fact that the I'nitcd State Quarries A, Granite Construction Co. control these quarries. The extent of their qusrry proposition up to date is atsjve stated. . Also, iinder the same heading, k the following: "Largest Plant in the United Mates. On the reverse side of this circular is picture of the "I-argcst Plant in the L'tiiti'd States," but asyet this plant is on paper alone, the foundation has not as yet leen started; in fact, ins a recent item of the local paper, it was stated that this company would be un able to cut the granite for the dam and dock, aforesaid, on account of their not having a plant to cut it in. This cir cular reads as follows t "We Now Con trol the Best and the Largest Light Barre Granite Quarry PropertU-s, with extensive facilities Can produen tlm granite in wholesale quantities and fill all orders for stock upon rneeipt nf the; same. 11ns Is a ranK liipisnce to tne other concerns in Barre. This company dues not control the "best and largest light Barre granite quarry properties," and as far as we can ascertain are not in a position to furnish granite any cheaper than the other quarrying con cerns. The circular is liable to mislead the trade, in this statement alone, that they control the "beht and largest lisht Barre granite quarry properties." . T quarry properties, such as the YVetinoie A Morse, K. L. Smith A Co.. Junes Bros. Co.. The Consolidated Granite Co.. and others, producing the light and; medium granites, are still in the hands ; of their original owners and are the largest quarries in Barre. As no state, incut is made regarding the controlling of dark quarries, nothing need lie said along this line, but -we will state. that they are still in the bands of those who have controlled them in the past." .
