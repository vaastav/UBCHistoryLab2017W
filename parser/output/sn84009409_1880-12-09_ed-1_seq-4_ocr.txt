The Capital of the United States hns, as usual, gotten herself up regardless nf expense, in anticipation the annual vis it of her heart's delight—Congress. The lovely brunettes and blondes in the Government offices are bedecked in their most witching costumes, and, when the hour of 4 i\ m. strikes, they pour out of the Treasury Department, the Patent, office, Census office, from all offices and promenade on Pennsyl vania Avenue, until that classic thor oughfare resembles, in fashion and co quetry, the boulevard ties' Ital'wnx. If the truth must be told, the average govern ment clerk is not as young and charm ing as she once was ; hut what she lacks j in youth and freshness is more than ! compensated for in experience. lam j writing now of her utility as a public servant, and not of her spectacular ef fectiveness in a street panorama. In the halcyon days of .Johnson's admin istration and of General Grant's first tern) she was young, and, in some in- I stances, it cannot be denied, was Hp po<nted because she had beauty and knew how to use it, but continued Ke- j publican success has presented that : rotation in office whictf might have ! kept the public offices supplied with young and pretty girls ; those that were young and pretty have, by a process of evolution, gone into matrimony or else where, and we have now in the public offices, through a double process ol nat ural selection, a survival of the fittest, and while they may not he so effective from a merely n-sthetic point of view, they are much more effective in legiti mate clerical accomplishments. As intimated in previous letters there is every disposition among Democrats to work for a quiet session. Though a majority of conservative members of the House were undoubtedly in the city on Saturday, nnd the usual prac tice is to hold a caucus as early as possi ble, none has yet been called, and it is likely none will he until after the ses sion commencing to-day is fairly at work. If the course of the Kepubli cans is such as to admit a decision I doubt not the Democratic caucus will decide to eschew political subjects dur ing the session. The last annual message of Mr. Hayes sent to Congress to-day, has several not able features. It is long enough to have them. Observing men will smile at the claim of a reform in the civil serv ice. There has been a change in public sentiment—a reaction from the de moralization which followed the general financial crash of 1873, which has pre vented such public dishonesty as char acterized the last years of Grant's term. Jtesides, the public business has resum ed the systematic methods of anti-war times, and this ensures regularity, or rather prevents glaring instances of irregularity in its transaction. Hut Mr. Hayes has reformed nothing. In neg loct of official duty for party principle, in levies upon officials for campaign purposes, tho present administration has been as a sneak thief compared to the highwayman-like predecessor, Mr. Hayes thinks his "reform" is shown by changes in New York Federal offi ces. What the people think is shown by the election to the Vice Presidency of Mr. Hayes' chief New York victim. The appointment to office of o many men who managed, or aided in carrying out the villainies in Louisiana and Flor ida, had, of course, no precedent and will never be followed as an example. The army is becoming demoralized, for no officer, however unworthy, can be got r'd of at this time, if he possesses even slight political influence, and this is a condition of affairs never known before. The message which claims any "reform" as the work of the present administration will excite laughter when the history of the administration is fully and fairly written. •Secretary Sherman joins Commission er liauni in recommending to Congress the abolition of the stamp tax on match es, bank checks and patent medicines.

KKNO. EUROPEAN LETTER. Prom our regular Corr-*|K>mltmt. HF.RI.IX, Germany, Nov. 2 ), 1880. Considerable excitement has been aroused throughout Germany by a duel, resulting from a deplorable anti Jewish agitation recently set on foot by Court < 'haplain Stoeckerand other injudicious fanatics, which took place a few days ago in the I.agenaelbolder Forest. It appears that a young lsraelitish gentle man, named Goldschmidl, who, after taking his University degrees, hud en tered the legal career as a referendary at Hanau, fulfilled his obligatory term of service in the army as a one-year vol unteer, under the immediate command of Lieutenant von Kapphengst, a Prus sian nobleman of ancient family, whose anti-Semitic prejudices prompted him to inllict many petty persecutions upon the youthful soldier, which the latter endured with commendable patience so long as he was precluded by the rules of the service from giving expression to his resentment, however justifiable. When his year was up he sent Son Kapphengst a challenge, which was re ferred by that officer to a military Court of Honor, according to a custom ob taining in such cases. The Court, after carefully considering the circumstances submitted by both parties to its judg merit, decided that sufficient provoca tion had been given to justify the chal lenge, and that the duel must take place without fail. Accordingly Gold schmidt and Von Kapphengst met on the 7th instant, and were paraded at thirty paces, with liberty to advance after the first fire to the so-calied bar rier, at which a distance of only fifteen feet would intervene between them. Several bullets were exchanged, and finally the resolute young Hebrew shot his aristocratic persecutor through the body, inflicting upon him a wound from which he is not expected to recover. As the Esquimaux at present visiting Berlin belong to a tribe that is nearly extinct, and are consequently, from an anthropological point of view, excep tionally interesting personages. Profess or Virchow, the eminent German eth nologist, recently obtained permission from their exhibitor to subject thetn to a scientific inspection, involving the measurement ol their skull*. While he was engaged in feeling the heads of the male Esquimaux, an old woman, named Paigmi, highly respected in the tribe as a potent witch, watched his movements with manifest interest and perturbation of spirit. When, however, lie approached tier in her turn, with outstretched hands, ttie conviction that he was a white sorcerer, bent upon robbing her of her supernatural powers completely overcame her sense ol deco rum, and she fled from him round the room leaping over tables nnd chairs with astonishing agility, for otic of her sex and age, and yelling out the strong est spells she could think of, as likely ! to prove efficient against the Professor's i necromalie manipulations. Somewhat j startled by good mother Paignu's gym nastic feats, Virchow and his two assist ants instinctively drew hack, where upon the Esquimaux Abraham, who has been converted to Christianity, but obviously retains a respectful recollec tion of his former faith, grew deadly pale, and was heard to mutter, "The | gods of rny country are mightier than i the Christian Deity. See how the white i magician recoils from Paignu's words of power." C. S. A. The Fish Commissioners. From the Altoona Trilmn**. The Pennsylvania Eish Commission held a meeting in Harrisburg last Thurs day to outline the report to be submit ted to the Legislature. It will he the most exhaustive ever prepared in the State, showing the progress made in pisciculture nnd describing the various kinds of fish and the character of the steams they inhabit. There are in the State about two hundred varieties of native fish and about seven kinds in troduced by the Kish Commissioners. The forthcoming report will contain n scientific and generic description of fishes by Professor Cope, of Philadel phia, and will be embellished with forty illustrations. Fish culture is yearly growing in importance and adding to the wealth of Pennsylvania. Commissioner Hewit is of the opinion that enough bans were caught this season to exc*-d all the appropriations if sold at five cents a pound. These fih now inhabit l,f>oo miles of streams in the Htale, and are multiplying with monstrous rapidity. The nearly 10 000 members of the National Guard of the Ntate have been supplied with overcoats of the regula tion pattern. The past few days 2.800 of these garments have been forwarded from the .State arsenal to the Second, Third and Fourth brigades. EQUALITY IN FREKtIITS* JL'DCIK lil.Ark's PROTEST AGAINST IKKI'JIIT Dlftrßl 111 NATIONS. Mm k'M U'tk'r to N. V. Cluiiiilier t i'omnium*. The two companies between Omaha and Sun Francisco raised in cash out ot government bonds, lands and mortgages of their franchises four or five times as much as they necessarily expended upon the roads. Tho stock holders, with out paying anything, put the enormous surplus into their pockets. These roads, thus built at the public expense and in some cases paid for by tho public five times over, are now claimed as the priv ate property of the companies, and the right of the public to use them as high ways is utterly denied; nevertheless I think the claim of these companies to take reasonable tolls stands upon the same foundation as that of companies whose roads were built by the stock holders themselves at their own proper expense. The grant of the lands in vested the grantees with a title which could not be revoked if the conditions of it were performed. If they sold or mortgaged the lands end invested the proceeds in tho construction of a rail road under a charter from a State or general government which authoriy.es them to take a fair prolit in the shape of tolls, they have as good aright to the tolls as if the capital to build the road had been raised by themselves; that is to say, those companies which built the railroads with capital donated by the public have the same right as other companies to charge a reasonable toll, but their demand of excessive tolls, though not worse in law, seems in the eye of natural reason a greater outrage. If railroad corporations have unlimited power which they claim, then all busi ness is at their mercy—agriculture, commerce, manufactures must suffer what they choose to inflict. They may rob labor of the bread it wins and de prive all enterprise of its just reward. Though this power does not belong to them legally they have been permitted to usurp it, and 1 need not tell you that they have grossly abused it. They avow that they make their exactions with an eye single to tlie'rown advantage, with out considering any right or interest of the public. They boldly express their determination to charge as much as the traffic will bear; that is tosnv, they will take from the profits of every man's business as much as can be taken with out compelling him to quit it. In the aggregate this amounts to the most enor mous, oppresive and unjust tax that ever was laid upon the industry of any peo pleaunder the sun. The irregularity with which this tax is laid makes it still harder to bear. Men go into a business which may thrive at present rates and will find themselves crushed hy burdens uticx pectedly thrown upon them after they get started. It is the habit of railroad companies to change their rates of transportation often and suddenly and in particular to make the charges ruin ously high without any notice at all. Th farmers of the great West have made a large crop of grain, which they may sell at fair prices if they can have it carried to the Hastern points, even at the unreasonably high freights of lat summer, But just now it is said thai the railway companies have agreed among themselves to raise the freight five rents per hundred weight, which is equal to an export tax upon the whole crop of probably $75,000,000. The farmers must submit to tlos highway rob fiery or cl-e keep the products ol their land to rot on their hands. Tliev submit, of course, as all other classes of indus trious people submit to similar impos ition". t'ornmon justice imperatively requires that freigfits be fixed, settled prescribed by law. and that they be not changed at the mere will of the railroad companies. Hut the discriminations which make the rates unequal are the most odious feature. A grain dealer at Haltimore gets a reduction or drawback which is denied toothers nnd he makes a fortune for himself while he ruins his competitors by underselling them. A single mill at Rochester csn stop the wheels of all the rest it its flour lie carried at a rate much lower. Hy discrimination* of this kind the profits of one coal mine may fie quadrupled, while an other, with all its fixtures anil machin ery, is rendered worthless. Such wrongs as these are done not only in a few sporadic cases, but generally and habit ually on a very large scale. Certain oil men, whose refinery wason Hong Island, got rebates amounting to $10,000,000 in eighteen months, and seventy nine house* (I believe that is the number) engaged in the same business were broken up. The creditors of t lie Read ing Railroad having coal lands of their own made discriminations between themselves nnd other* which drove all competition out of the field, gave them the monopoly of the Philadelphia mar ket nnd enabled them to charge for their coal as they charged for their freights—whatever they pleased. Thus producers, dealers and consumers all suffer together. Worse still than that, the prosperity of large communities is blighted hy the refusal of railroads to carry tho product" of their farms, gar dens and shops unless they submit to the payment of rates much larger than what are charged on similar good* from other regions much further away from the common market. The case you mention of $4 from New York to Salt Hake and only #2.50 to San Francisco is, perhaps, not the most unrighteous, hut it is as gross a violation of legal princi ple as can he conceived. If the railways belong to the people then the rights of all citizens are precisely equal and all discriminations are unlawful. Unity Siued.

Some time since a gentleman in this city was requested by a friend at Mel bourne, Australia, to forward by a des ignated route from some United States post office, via. New York, a universal postal union trip around the world. It will he seen that the route was not tho direct and regular one, but somewhat of a doviulion. The card was sent as requested and the trip accomplished in 123 days. It was dropped in the post office in this city August 4, and reached here in return on last Saturday, Decem ber 4, in as good a condition as when it left, notwithstanding it had paid its respects to postmasters in Europe, Afri ca, Asia and North America. <>n tlie face, the card was directed to a gentleman, giving the street and number, "Ilariisburg, Henna., United States of America." Hy the side of this appears "Via London, England; Marseilles, France; Naples, Italy; f'on stantinople, Turkey; Uairo, Egypt; Suez Canal to Calcutta, India; San Fran cisco, U. S. A. tin the hack appears in English, "This card is on its way around the world; please forward by route di rected on other side;" virtually the same instructions follow in French to the postmaster at Marseilles, then the same in Italian to the postmaster at Naples, again in French to the postmas ter at Constantinople, then in French the following to the postmaster at Cai ro : "Please forward to Calcutta via Suez Canal. Nineteen post office cancelling stamps adorn the missive, tront and back, showing the date of its respective ar rivals. They are Harrisburg, August 4 ; New York, August 5; London, August Hi; Calais, August lf>; Marseilles, (can not he read); Naples, August 2D ; Hrin disl, August 20; Constantinople, August 27; Alexandria, September 5, arrived ; Alexandria, September 5; Cairo, Sep tember 5; Suez, September 5; Sea post otlice, September 9; Calcutta, October S; Hong Kong, October 23; Hong Kong, October 25; >an Francisco, November 27; ami Ogden, November 29; N. 5". and R. P. 0., December 4. The course taken in detail was as fol lows: Harrisburg to New York, thence by Atlantic ocean to Liverpool, thence across England to London, thence to Dover ami across the English channel to Calais, thence over Frunce to Mar seilles, thence via. the Mediterranean sea to Naples, thence across Italy to Hrindisi, thence by the Adriatic sea, the strait of Urnrito. the Mediterranean sea and on between Greece and Candia, up tho Archipelago, through the Dar danelles and the sea of Marmora to Constantinople, thence back by the sea ol Marmora, the Dardanelles, the Arch ipelago, and across the Meditetranean to Alexandria, thence along the Delta and across ihe river Nile to Cairo, thence back to Alexandria, thence by the Mediternnean to Suez, thence by the Suez canal, Red Sea, gulf of Aden, Ara bian sea, Indian ocean around Ceylon to the Bay of Bengal, and up it to Calcutta, thence by bay of Bengal, strut* of Malacca between Sumatra and Malacca, and up the China sea to Hong Kong, thence by the Pacific ocean, vis. Sand wich islands to San Francisco, thence overland to Harrisburg. Here is an opportunity for geograph ical scholars to figure out the distance t lie card went. It left Harrisburg about 4p. in. of tlie fourth of August, was four months on the journey, and arriv ed in Harrisburg about 4 p. m. on the fourth of December. Another gentle man further tested the experiment by directing a similar card around in the op/io/iite direction two dava alter the first one had been mailed. The little trav elers passed somewhere about Calcutta, going different directions, but both tound for tfie same destination. Owing to the present rough condition of the Atlantic, the other card will not proba bly reach here for at least ten days yet. Some time since the British govern inent complained to the United States authorities that some cards of this char acter had passed its mails, ami request ed that, as they occasioned great incon venience, the forwarding of them in future should he forbidden, whereupon the postmaster general at Washington issued an order in compliance with this request. The card is quite a curiosity, nnd has a further journey to make of two months before arriving at its final desti nation, (Australia.) It will bo inclosed and forwarded in a few days to Mel bourne. It is at present in the window of C. A. Boas' jewelery store, where the curious may take a glance at the little traveller. Bur Postal Service. Postmaster General Maynard has just issued the report of his Department for the past fiscal year. Among many items mentioned, it is stated that the money order system continues to grow in popular favor, its operations having been increased from a little over sl,- 000,000 in 1805, to more than SIOO,- 000,000 in the past year. At the pres ent rate of charges the lees have cover ed the expenses with a slight margin of profit. Fully one half of the orders issued are for sums less than $5. The report suggests the reduction of the fee for money orders not .exceeding #5 to 5 cents, and the extension of the maxi mum limit of an order from #SO to SIOO, so taat the increased commissions received for large orders may oftset the loss resulting from the reduced fee for small orders. The establishment of a postal savings system is recommended, and tbe post office control of the telegraph aystem. Mr. Maynard renews the recommend ation of Postmaster General Key that newspapers containing lottery adver tisement* be deprived of the privileges of the mails. The privilege of registration, previ ously restricted to letter*, waa extended in 1878 to all other mail matter, and the registry system has been greatly improved by the introduction of through registered pouch exchanges and other means to secure the safety of registered matter, so that the loss for the past year waa only one out of every 6,258 pieces handled. The number of letter* and parcels registered during the fiscal year ended June 30 last was 6.996.513. of which, in round numbers, 5.250,000 were domes tic letters, 450 000 domestic parcels of third and fourth class matter, 250,(XX) letters to foreign countries, and upward of 1,000.000 letters and parcels of offi cial matter forwarded for the Govern ment, and by law exempt from payment of' registry fees. The amount of fees collected was #595.794, which is an in crease of nearly 30 per cent, over the preceding year. The increase in the number of letters and parcels registered was 1,567,491. A newly authorized registration of third and lourtb class matter, (merchandise, See..) is reported to he still attended with extraordinary success, 153,253 parcels being registered during lh fiscal year at the New York t'ity Post Office.

Not an improbable forecast. The Capital City of the country has already entered on its third stage, with more than half the population credited to it in 1890. Ten years may double the present census, and the concentration of political power and political corrup tion is likely to more than double. The bent of the Republican party is in this direction, and there i* no leader in its councils able to check it if he would. Allowing to President tiarfield a vir tue further above suspicion than her of Rome and a greater than Spartan courage—all that is pure of purpose and resolute of will—he will be no more than a puppet in the hands of a showman against the tide ol ccntraliza lion that is setting in upon the Federal metropolis, freighted with it* splendid travesties upon constitutional liberty. Ihe memory ol "that sometime pop ular heresy—State rights," will endeed, tie effaced, but wherein are the people to be gainers by the exchange? Wfial is to compensate them for the surren der of self-government to the govern ment of a tnonied oligarchy, upon whose skirts they will be condemned to hang like beggarly dependents? What is to be accomplished m behalf of hu man freedom, of human virtue, of human happiness, by a " Nationaliza tion" of sentiment that is to convert Washington into a Babylon, tbe people into servitude and tlieir boasted sover eignty into a farce? 1 here will lis vice and corruption in high places—profligacy and venality on every hand— "hut" all these things will be more than counterbalanced by " a concentration of |>olitiral power." In this will be found a remedy for tbe ill* of its own creation—the tummum honvm of our National hope—a something to be embraced as an idol ol unchaste worship by men who once esteemed it a distinction above all price to lie free American citizens. It i* not a vi-ta to which the patriot looks forward with pride or pleasure, but it i prefigured bv the oracles of the Republican party, it is a condition that the Republican par ty appears to covet, it is a destiny that cannot be averted if tbe Republican party remains permanently in power.

Colonel Gordon, who has been on a tour of the whole west of Ireland, writes that the condition of tiie people i* worse than that of any other in the world. A gulf of antipathy exists between them and the landlords. Citing as a precedent the measures taken to afmlish slavery in the West Indies he presses that the government should buy out all the landlords west of the Shannon at a cost of £XO.OOd,(XXI, of which a great part will be repaid by tenants, and the can cer will be cured. He also proposes that the lands thus acquired be admin istered by a land commission supple mented by an emigration commission, laird ("ranbrook (Conservative), speak ing nt Beach Hampstend last night, de clared as tho government hail failed to suspend the habeas corpus act, if fur ther outrages were committed the blood would he on their heads. Lord Justice James writes to the Timet that the rent of Irish holdings should be fixed at twenty to twenty-five per cent, over Griffiths' valuation, and that any land lord dissatisfied with this should be en titled to call on the government to pur chase the land at a tair price. A Dublin dispatch says that the affi davits of Messrs. Parnell, Biggur, J. D. Sullivan, Sexton and Dillon, on which to base an application for postponement of the trial of the traversers, on the ground that the date already fixed will interfere with their constitutional right to be present when I'atliament meets, were filed in the Crown offices at 8 o'clock last evening. The traversers will apply for a postponement of the trial until the 25th ot January. Tho government has ordered the prosecution of the Sligo Champion for publishing a notice calling on a tenant to relinquish his farm.

The grain receipts at St. Louis for the t resent year will probably aggre gate 60.000,000 bushels, an increase of nearly 60 per cent, orer last year.
