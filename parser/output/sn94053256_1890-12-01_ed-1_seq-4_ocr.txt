Judge Freed man of the superior court in New York has denied an application made on behalf of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad company to set aside the service of summons upon it. because it was made upon a director, and also because the service was not made by an officer empowered by law to serve process issued ny mat court. A great number of suits are pending against this road, brought by passengers who were charged more man tne regu lar fare of three cents per mile to go to the Morris park races. Each action is brought to recover a penalty of $50 under the statute. The judge holds that the service is valid in this instance be cause the railroad obtained a franchise from New York as well as Connecticut, although in an ordinary case of a for eign corporation the servioe would be insufficient. He says that service by an officer is not requisite where the suit for a penalty is brought by the party di rectly aggrieved. CITY NEWS. The board of fire commissioners will meet this evening.

THE WATER QUESTION win Be Discussed Agalu at tbe Meeting This Evening, The matter of securing the services of an experienced hydraulic engineer from abroad to act in conjunction with the water commissioners in the present crisis, will be acted upon at the meeting of the common council this evening, The petition through the medium of which the matter will be brought up for discussion, provraes for a special investi gation of the Mad river supply. The Democrat has all along claimed that the Mad river supply was by far the best available for this city. By the plan proposed a reservoir can be made less than two miles from the present pumping station. " If sufficient pressure can not be secured at this point, it will be necessary either to continue to pump from the river or locate the reservoir back in the hills. The water is there. and plenty of it, and it is for the engi neers to decide the beet and cheapest way to supply it to tbe city. One thing to be remembered is this : That if neces sary water, can be pumped from the Mad river 65 days in the year for su.ooo, about one-hair the cost of tbe interest it will be necessary to pay upon the $400,000 bonds it is proposed to issue.

Many years ago he carried on quite an exten sive business in the manufacture of daguerreotype frames, having a factory at Hart's road on Roaring brook.

The president's manna ere of 11.000 words to the senate and house of representatives begins by complimenting the management of the several aepartments ui iu uuaui during tbe past year, anu states mat tne revenues amounting to about $450,000.- 000 have been collected. It reviews the recent Pan-American and international marine conferences, with approval, touches on the conference at Brussels, devises means for suppressing the African slave trade, congratulates the now republic of Brazil upon its success ful formation. . The president then alludes to the Nicauragua canal project and to our re lations with China and France. States that the Samoan treaty has- begun to produce salutary effects, as also the new treaty of extradition with Great Britain. In regard to the Behring sea contro versy, he states that he sincerely- hopes that before the opening of another seal ing season some arrangement may be effected that will assure to us, a pro perty right, divided from Russia which was not disregarded by any nation for more than eighty years preceding the outbreak of existing trouble. Alluding to the cordial character of our relations with Spain ne says that the extent and development of our trade with Cuba make it not tobe doubted that a special arrangement with regard to commerce, based upon the reciprocity or the recent tariti act, win operate most beneficially with both investments. The message states that the govern ment revenue, from all sources for the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1890, were $463,966,080.55, and the total expendi tures for the same period $308,618,584.52. Deducting the postal receipts not here tofore included in these aggregates of $60,882,097.92 from both sides of the account the surplus for the year in cluding the amount applied to the sink ing tund, was $105,344,496.03. The re ceipts for 1890 were $16,030,923.79 and the expenditures $10,739,871 in excess of those of 1889. The president says that; some months further trial will be necessary to deter mine the permanent effect of the recent legislation upon silver values. The message then proceeds to commend the efforts of the secretary of the treasury to increase tne volume oi money in circu lation, by keeping down the treasury surplus to the lowest practical limit; says that the increase of money in circu lation during the last 19 months has been in the aggregate upwards of $93, 000,000 and that of this increase only $7,000,000 was due to recent silver legis lation ; and that this substantial and needed aid to commerce, resulted in an enormous reduction of the public debt, The mormon Question is alluded to very briefly, and the increase in num bers and influence of the non-mormon population in Utah are observed with satisfaction. The president congratu lates the country on the admission of the states of Wyoming and Idaho to the union ; says that the completion of the census devolves upon congress the duty or a new apportionment ot representa tives ; declares that in the matter of bills providing for the erection of publio uuuuings, a wise economy uasea upon some responsible examination should be exercised, as no class of legislation is more liable to abuse, or to degenerate into the unseemly scramble about the public treasury. After a review of the report of the secretary of agriculture, the president takes up civil service law, and says that tne law so tar as ne can learn has been executed by those having the power of appointments in tbe classified service with fidelity and impartiality, and that the service has been increasingly satis- ractory. in regard to the famous McKmlev bill the president argues in general that it has not had a fair trial and that its per manent effects upon trade and prices is still largely a conjecture. He says in substance that the misinformation as to the terms of the act which has been so widely dessiminated at home and abroad will be corrected by experience. ine-president continues strongly in favor of reciprocity and says that we now have the concurrence of both houses in advance, in a distinct and defi nite offer of free entry to our ports of specific articles. He expresses a hope that this and other important measures will be brought to a final vote in this congress or else all work that has been done upon them will be lost. The message concludes with a long argument as to tne advantages ot the existing law providing for a federal supervision of congressional elections ; says that the arguments against this are not well founded, and that it is not a new exercise of the federal power or in vasion of the rights of the states as has been claimed. He says that no choice is left to him but to enforce with vigor all laws intended to secure for the citizens his constitutional rights and to recom mend that the inadeouacies of such laws be promptly remedu d. 

GLADSTONE'S DAUGHTER. Site Is !u Mny i-ftpctfl a Worthy Suo ceasor to lier Father. The children of great and world re nowned men are so often most insignifl- oant by contrast with their parents, that it is decidedly Interesting to find a case in which the strong individuality of the daughter makes her a worthy successor to the grand old man her father. Miss Gladstone is vice president of Sidgwick Hall, - Newnham College for Women, Cambridge, England, and according to a private letter in an Eastern contempor ary, is an exceedingly original person. In looks she resembles her father, and she has, I fancy, his vitality. She is al ways laughing, joking, telling stories. She keeps tbe high table in a roar. In deed, whenever I hear a commotion, I turn to see if Miss Gladstone is not about, and she generally is. She is ut terly regardless of dress, comes down to seven o'clock dinner in a gingham. and for lunches and garden parties gets herself up to look like the strong- minded, practical wife of a country min ister. She seems frank, sympathetic, kindly, and has great magnetism;" con tmues the writer. "Streams of power flow out of her eyes. It amuses me to think what a shock she would be to many Boston people. If she were intro duced as 'Miss Brown, of Chicago,' they I would - pronounce her 'shocking,' 'the . typical Western woman,' a person who must be sat upon and silenced at all costs. But her big nature and splendid vitality would drown their little criti cisms, and when they found her to be Miss Gladstone they would pronounce her 'a glorious creature.'." Cor. Boston Transcript. . She f 'What a long time you've been talking to that stout old lady! Who is she?" He "She's my rioh aunt. I've only been paying my 'legacy duty.'." Wm. Cob Holmes.M.D., Brown's bl'k, -

A large and appreciative audience at the opera house last evening attested the interest felt in t rederic Bryton s new comedy drama of the above title. The title character was made especially for Mr Bryton by E. E. Rose, a member of the present company, who knew the ac tor's peculiar ability, and the part fits him admirably Morning Alan. At the opera house Wednesday evening. John L. Coming. Manager Pincus is to be congratulated on his business tact in bringing a great novelty to waterbury in tbe shape of the world's champion, John L. Sullivan, who will be seen in conjunction with the earnest actor-author, Duncan B. Harrison, in the new comedy drama Honest Hearts and Willing Hands." Messrs Harrison & Sullivan will be sup ported by an excellent company of players. Among the many novel fea tures will be the grand athletic exhibi tion between the world's champion, John L. and Joe Lannon. Mr Pincus' idea at first was to play the company in the casino theatre, but the demand for seats was so large, and as the City hall is the only available place, he decided to produce the play there. Consequently the casino will be closed on that even ing. Pincus' Casino Theatre, To-night will be the' first of the three nights' engagement of the far-famed Whaiien-Martell combination, compris ing 33 oi tne greatest artists in tbe pro fession. It is without doubt the largest and finest that has ever visited Water bury. Standing room only will be the sign, no doubt.
