The Minneapolis Journal gets away ahead of its marvelous record of a year ago by running 161 columns more advertising in November, 1901, than in Novem ber, 1900. In November, 1901. The Journal carried 1277 columns of adver tising, this being 16£ per cent more than the daily and Sunday issues combined of The Journal's nearest Minneapolis competitor. Advertisers prove the circulation of The Journal by using it more than any other paper. The Journal's circulation for November, 1901, averaged 51775 copies daily, or 4,230 daily more than for November, 1900. Henderson's Good Advice During the first two days of the pres ent session of congress over 3,000 bills were introduced in the house, about 2,500 of which were private bills. There Is nothing surprising in this passion for in troducing bills. It is the chief delight of the American legislator. He really thinks more of himself if he can make a big rec ord as a bill introducer than he does if he can make a record as a successful pusher of bills. The bills will continue to toe introduced by the thousands, covering not only private matters which should go to the court of claims, but projects ■which would readily receive the signa tures of Don Quixote and his faithful Sancho. Speaker Henderson, in his address to the republican caucus last Saturday, sug gested one of the dangers confronting the house with its thirty-nine republican ma jority. Said he: We will requlio all of the wisdem we posses.-;, and all of the patriotism, for we have a jjieai danger to confront us continuously and that is the surplus iv the treasury. I appeal to my republican colleagues to keep in mind that this is a danger, and if we can bo wiire in the presence of that danger we will find approval from the American people. The American people do not expect any nig gardliness iv the treatment of the matters that they require. 1 do not counsel that, but I counsel that confervative consideration of every question which should be observed at all times without leference to .the hundred million that we are soon to have. The speaker had reference to Secretary Gage's report, which shows that the esti mated revenues of the government for the current fiscal year are $688,633,042, on the basis of existing laws, and the expendi tures for the same year $588,633,042, leav ing a surplus of $100,000,000. The speaker properly recognizes in this surplus "a great danger." It Is a danger and a great danger, because it has generally been a habit of congress, and indeed, a rather vicious habit, to pounce upon a surplus In the treasury and exhaust it with a vorac ity, marvelous .to behold," and, after spend ing It, have nothing rational in the way of expenditures to show for such intense activity. When congress la not playing on the surplus, some of it is used to take up United States bonds or to antiolpa-'e in terest payments on bonds, while a large portion of it is kept out of the channels of business where it is needed. The ra tional treatment of a surplus is to merge l.t in the circulating medium when the activities of business require its use and retire it when not needed by business. The absorption of the circulating medium by the treasury brings industrial and com mercial life into too much dependence upon the public finances. A $100,000,000 aurpluß starts every man who writes the mys.tioal figures M. C. after his name agitating his cerebral lobes and sensory ganglia to originate his por tion of the details of the river and har bor bill or some other large absorbent of the public funds, and resultant benefits to the public are practically nil. This kind of business is working in the public, the national interest with a vengeanoe. It is selfishness incarnated. As if the surplus was a grab bag for the amusement of con gressmen and their henchmen. Minneapolis has twenty-six detectives, but they were all so busy last night that not one of them could be spared to holp a poor, "easy mark" for the "big mit" gang to recover $775 which he had lost by a crooked gambling scheme and con fidence game. Comment on these facts would be utterly superfluous. The Canal Treaty The surmises as to the contents of the isthmian canal treaty, prove to have been mainly correct, the official text sent to the senate yesterday differing from the conjectural text only with re spect to the fortification of the canal, which is certainly not eVen by implication permitted. Article 111., section 2, reads: The canal shall never be blockaded nor shall any right of war be exercised nor any act of hostility be committed within it. The United States, however, shall be at liberty to maintatin such military police along the canal as may be necessary to protect it against lawlessness and disorder. To maintain a military police along the line of the canal cannot, by any rules of syntax, be construed into meaning the erection of fortifications at the terminals and along the route. The treaty permits only the necessary military patrol, which is all that is necessary. The third article of the treaty provides for the absolute neutralization of the canal, guaranteed by the United States exclusively, on the basis of the Suez canal rules, which pro vide for the use of the canal by belliger ents under certain conditions. The treaty Is very much better than the former one, which gave the United States the power to adopt any measures it saw fit "to secure by Its own forces the de fense of the United States and the main tenance »of public order," which means something much more formidable than the maintenance of a military police along the canal. The Hepburn idea la&t year was for our government to heavily fortify the canal as a permanent Gibraltar, mak ing it an instrument of war instead of an j instrument of peace. Such course would I be tantamount to a challenge to the whole maritime world with a big chip on Uncle Sam's shoulder. Obviously the canal would be safer without fortifications than with them. It is possible that the chauvinists who regard a heavily fortified canal as abso lutely indispensable may desire some ex plicit declaration to that effect, but the weight of public sentiment is against fur ther delay and there is a much moro favorable outlook for the ratification of thet reaty than heretofore. The most evasive and tricksy politician i» aware that there is an actual popular demand for the isthmian canal which cannot be Ignored, especially as the public have reason to be lieve that the transcontinental railways are working against the construction of a ship canal. The Walker commission gives a rather unqualified Indorsement to the Nicaragua route, the estimated cost of which is re duced to $189,000,000, which is $10,000,000 to $12,000,000 below the former estimate. It is now estimated that the completion of the Panama canal would, with the value of the rights and plant, cost $253, --000,000, which is far in excess of the cost of the Nicaragua canal, which, however, ia three and one-half times as long as the Panama route, but affords a shorter route from our gulf ports to the Pacific coast ports of the north continent.. The estimates of the cost of these canals have varied widely. No two engineers have figured it out 'alike. It has been gravely estimated that the Nicaragua canal would cost $108,000,000. One of the many com missions has figured the cost at below $100,000,000, and another reported $135, --000,000, and so on. Even the Walker com mission may be doing no little guessing at $189,000,000. Only a few months ago their estimate was $203,000,000. However, if we are to have an Isthmian canal, the present Is the time to make every arrangement and construct it. It will take ten yeare to do it. As a busi ness nation, let us proceed to business, effect the necessary treaties with Nica ragua and Costa Rica and go to work. A Nation Treats With a Monarch The difference between the old ideas of government and the new is most im jpresslvely brought out by the introductory i words of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty: The United States of America and his Majesty Edward the VII. of the United King dom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the seas, king, and emperor of India being desirous, etc. On the one hand the nation, the people; on the other hand the king and emperor. There is not a word of reference to the British empire in the whole treaty except as a means of geographically locating "His Majesty Edward the VII." Of course we all understand that King Ed ward is a sort of a flgure-head and not much more, and that it is even doubtful whether he has ever read the new treaty or has any definite idea as to what it is about. But under the thrall of ancient custom, of the old theory that the nation is the king's estate, the English people go on making out state documents as if the king were still the source of political power. The senate thinks the reciprocity trea ties are safely pigeon-holed. In the meantime our manufacturing capacity goes on increasing far beyond our ability to consume. The foreign market Is be coming more and more of a desideratum. The time to enlarge the foreign market is when we are prosperous, for that is a means of continuing prosperity. But the chances are that wo shall accept the blindly optimistic theory of letting "well enough alone," and not attempt to enlarge THE 

MINNEAPOLIS JOUBNAE. our markets by treaty until the accumu lation of surplus products has depressed prices and given us hard times. The value of the manufactured goods made In Minnesota in 1900 was $262,665,881, an increase in ten years of some $70,000, --000. A striking feature of the census bulle tin that gives the data regarding the state's manufactures is that it shows that the individual laborer's share of the re turns ia considerably larger now than in 1890. The number or wag-eearners has in creased only 10.7 per cent in ten years, whereas the total of their wages has in creasd 16.7 per cent. The average of wages has increased from $440 to $460 per annum. It is significant of Minne apolis' industrial supremacy that it manu factures not far from half of all the goods produced in the state and that of the in crease of $70,000,000 for the whole state $30,000,000, is accredited to Minneapolis. Profit in Forest Raising A good many people have the Idea that forestry is not business. The impression somehow prevails that forests, grown and cared for by the state, may have some value for their effect upon climate, water supply, etc., but that the raising of for ests ia entirely too slow as a profit-pro ducing undertaking for Americans to interest themselves in. General Andrews, chief forest flre warden, made some state ments at the meeting of the agricultural society yesterday, however, which are in teresting. Minnesota, he says, has about 3,000,000 acres of toilly, rocky, or sandy land upon which coniferous forests will permanently flourish, but which are of lit tle or no value for agricultural purposes. He says if these 8,000,000 acres were to be planted In the next eighty years, an equal portion annually, at the end of that period, and forever afterward, the state might derive from her forests a net annual revenue of $3,000,000, representing a capi tal of $100,000,000. At least half of these 3,000,000 acres, according to General Andrews, is government land, but could undoubtedly be acquired by the state for forestry purposes. After having regarded pine forests for so long as something merely to be hacked down as rapidly a3 possible, and with the least possible re gard for the young, growing timber, it is rather difficult for us to adjust ourselves to the idea of reforestation and' the restoring of the valuable young growth, but it is evident that it will pay to do it. It begins to look as if President Roose velt would establish a new precedent for presidential promotion of legislation. The old idea was for the president to sit still and run the machine built for him by the constitution and the laws. Now he recommends legislation, and Roosevelt is likely to push it so hard that congress will wonder if he is not interfering with its exclusive prerogatives. By means of his dinners at the White House the presi dent ie likely to become the most influ ential lobbyist in Washington. Reform the Consular Service The presid«nt's devotion to civil ser vice reform came out strongly in his recommendation for reform of the consu lar service on the basis of admission to the service only after tests of fitness, and promotion for merit with no possibility of tenure of office depending on partizan considerations. Because the German and British gevernments have lately been copying and patterning after some of the methods in vogue in our consular service the impression has gone abroad that it is now very efficient. There are a number of able and zealous consuls in the service, and it is on their reports and "businesslike methods that the present good fame of the service largely rests. But there are many worthless political appointees who are of no use whatever to anybody except the man who paid a political debt by securing their appointment. If there is any governmental function that requires trained and experienced men it is the consular service. It requires men acquainted with foreign languages, ex perts in economic questions; men of wide information, well posted on the commer cial history of modern nations, informed as to the peculiar characteristics of trade and commerce in the country they deal with;' men of business ability; men animated by the prospect of promotion and continuous service. There is no more ludicrous spectacle in the world than that of an American local politician dropped down as consul in some country he never heard of till he applied for a place. A writer In the Forum relates an inci dent of the politically manipulated) con sular service that is in itself enough to damn the whole system. A certain United States consul was transferred from a French to a German city without change of salary. He spoke French fluently, pos sessed an intimate knowledge of French 'business methods, understoodl the class of business that went through his hands and had satisfectorilly filled the duties of the French office. He could not speak German and knew nothing about German business methods. His successor had neither business experience nor other special qualifications and did not know the French languag-. He explained that he had_been offered the choice of two posi tions; one in Francs* and the other in Ger many. He preferred France. The old consul had to go to Germany. In this era the consul is almost wholly a commercial agent. He rarely has any diplomatic duties to perform. He is an outpost, a scout for the trade of his country. He must be a man fitted to per form the duties required of him. If he is not the country wastes the salary it pays him. It wastes the salary at every consul whose work does not constantly tend to promote American commercial interests. Chile and Argentine wish to fight, but can't quite reach each other. The Andes are hard to cross and it ia a long way around 'by water. They ought to have thought of this when they delimited their frontiers. It is surprising that two South American countries should have so far forgotten their principal industry as not to arrange their frontiers so they could easily strike each other.

Dec. 2.—1 had been keeping pretty quiet in the box under th« counter when the pro prietor of the shop dragged me out and hung me in the window. I noticed the policeman kept looking in and reading carefully the ordinance for the suppression of unnecessary noise. He was undecided whether or not to pull me. I crept behind the fall stock ings f.nd he must have thought it was they who were making the riot. Several of the heavy young dressers of the town looked in at the window during the day and wh-eu they heard me they stuffed cotton into their ears.

It has been running for 150 years, having been established by Catherine the Great. In that time it has b&en a temporary horns for 800,000 babies. Any woman may bring her baby to this home and no questions are asked. If the mother wishes she may enter the in stitution as a nurse, provided she will nurse one other child besides her own. The system works perfectly and the nurses seem to adore their little charges. When the Infants are I 3 months old they are sent out to farms in I the country with their nurses, board is paid, j clothing given they and at 5 years they are ' taken back to go in the state industrial school, I unless the family has become attached to the child and wishes to adopt. When you enter the hospital you see rows of metal cradles in long alleys, each cradle containing its baby. In this room arises one mighty and continuous walling and crying, made up of the fretting, grief, discomfort and anger of 1,400 combined infant voices. The noise is as terrific as the cry of the first baby in the ears of the new father at 2 a. m.. Nat such a bad government after all is the Russian monarchy when it will get up in the night in this way to look after it 3 fatherless little ones. We have been inclined to think of Russia as everything that :s hari hearted and tyranical, but it mothers 14,000 homeless waifs each year, in this one institution, cares fcr them through childhood and youth, gives a small dot to each girl when she marries, and as'for the kids, shi^ agrees to start every boy jack of them in life with a trade. Russia isn't so bad. —A. J. Russtll. THE 

COMBATANT God called a little soul to Him, Forth from his quiring serapKim, A little spirit, spotless white, Out of his multitude of light. "Wilt leave the glories at my throne, And venture thea In ways unknown, To acquaint thyself, from youth to age, With yonder human heritage? "Weaponsd for warfare thou shalt go, In armor such as mortals know. To wrestle thro' the unresting years With sins and sorrows, foea and fears." "O gallant quest! 0 high emprise, To fight beneath my Father's eyes! Thou, Lord, my perils proudly past, Shall crown me victor at the last!" • • * • • A weary soul, one midnight iate, Knocked humbly at the heaven gate, With dinted helm and broken sword And downcast head before the Lord.

"Nor wiles I had nor countermines Against the cunning foe's designs; I can no more—my strength is spent— Bid me, disgraced, to bauishment!" Then did the Lord upon His breast Fold that poor bleeding soul to rest; "Thou strivest well, my child," said He; "I spake not aught of victory!" —Pall Mall Gazette. SMOOTH ELECTION TRICK "One of the smoothest political tricks ever played," said a Baltimore man recently, "wes pulled off in Talbot ctfßßty, on the eastern shore of Maryland, some years ago, when about two hundred negroes voted the wrong ticket without knowing it before our side found out that anything was going wrong. The county was very close that year, and the republicans had to count upon the votes of the negroes to win. Few of these citizens could read, but they had been instructed to put their cross mark on the Australian ballot In front of Massa Lincoln's nose. They had shown that they could at least do this much, and the republicans considered everything well in hand. But the democrats were in control of the oounty, and the 'Jackson and Liberty' emblem had first place on the bal lot, the democrats also having charge of all the election printing. When the official sam ple 'ballots were published, not one repub lican in the county, for some strange reason, noticed that Lincoln's head in the repub lican emblem was turned to the left instead to the right. The result was, naturally, that all the illiterate negroes who voted 'in front of Lincoln's nose,' marked their crosses to the right of 'Jackson and Liberty," thereby voting the straight democratic ticket. About 11 a. m. some backwoods republican noticed that Lincoln's face was turned the wrong way and reported to ta« managers. Then Ihwre were doings." AMUSEMENTS "Her Lord and Master" at the Met ropolitan, In the pursuit of happiness—that will o* tha wisp which flits alluringly on before mankind—matrimony has, slnc« time began, been & favorite reliance. Let it be supposed that a man and a woman, of widely differing temperaments, of divergent habits of life and modes of thought, a pair whose viewpoints are an ocean apart, agree to press on to gether In the pursuit of happiness—how are they to keep step in the race? who is to make the pace and who is .obediently to fall in behind? or are they to run side by side, each accommodating his gait to the other? That Is the problem which Martha Morton has treated with remarkable success in her latest play, "Her Lord and Master." The interest lies not in the answer—for as all the world knows, the answer is, "Love will find a way"—but in the treatment of this international sociological theme. Nor would it be safe to generalize from Miss Morton's play, for with rare good judgment she has chosen to d-eal not with types but with indi viduals—individuals that have not only the general characteristics of their class but personal characteristics as well that serve to make real persons of them. The unity of motive exhibited in "Her Lord and Master" is remarkable. The ac tion progresses steadily without too much haste and yet without waste of time on side issues. From the first, the attention is con centered on these two and their problem. With marvelous art, the story is so con trived that we get the viewpoint of each in turn and never lose sympathy with either. The contrasts between American and Eng lish ways are effectively brought out, and in such a. way that, while furnishing delicious comedy, they at the same time throw strong, revealing light on the persons of the play and their relations. It is the unexpected, too, that happens in this play, for Miss Morton I has succeeded in avoiding the commonplace and in taking her characters through new pathways to a denouement that is natural and satisfying, without having been, too clearly foreshadowed. Of the many good plays she has written, this one seems the most symmetrical—like a diamond in its clarity and brilliance. It is fortunate that a play so well con ceived and executed has fallen into such capable hands, and that its characters are actualized for us by such a fine company of players as that which appeared at the Metro politan last night. Herbert Keloey is, of course, thoroughly at home as the well-bred Englishman to whom life, is a very serious matter and who has broken all his rules of that life by falling in love with the wayward, undeveloped American girl. His picture of that Englishman is all the more interesting because of its absolute truth. One does not n«ed to know that Mr. Kelcey is English by birth and training to recognize the convinc ing quality of the portrait. This Briton's emotions, like those of most of his country men, lie far beneath the surface; they are not to be revealed lightly but only under the stress of great events. Thus it happens that Mr. Kelcey, after his severely correct and serious demeanor in the earlier scnes of the play, is able to make the self-revelationa later on almost lightning-like in their sharp ness and do it, too, without the slightest trace of theatricallsm. It is a triumph of his art. Miss Effle Shannon seems to have developed an unsuspected plasticity in her impersona tion of the wayward American girl—or pos sibly the role with its rapidly shifting moods is responsible for the exhibition of a versa tility and resourcefulness that have not hitherto had full play. Certainly Miss Shan non must surprise even her most ardent ad mirers with her fine delineation of this spoiled child's development into womanhood. While more likable in her lighter moments, when queening it over every one in the regal way the American youngster has, she rises to the full measure of the requirements in •the strenuous passages of the third and fourth acts. Miss Shannon's voice is not strong or penetrative and this is a little against her, but she uses it with consummate art, never even in the height of passion pushing it be yond its powers. The fresh girlishness with which she contrives to invest the character is not the least admirable of its attributes. Her father, played with unction by Charles W. Stokes, and her mother—a rather colorless piece of work by Miss Ida Darling—and lastly that miraculously young grandmother (Miss Hattie Russell), make a set of vastly in teresting American photographs. Perhaps there is a touch of caricature in "grandma." but Miss Russell gets so much charming comedy out of that somewhat giddy and almost impossible young old lady that it is forgiven. To the trio must be added the refreshingly naif American youth, played wonderfully well by Douglas Fairbanks. As for the other Eng lish persons in the play, they are quite as happy efforts at dramatic portraiture as the Americans. There is the dear, prim old lady, the aristocratic mother, player! by Mrs. Isabel Waldron. There is the old English servant of Percy Brooke—was there ever a cleverer, more touching bit of character-sketching than that? And Morton Selten as the stiff old bachelor uncle who has become enamored of American ways and American slang and per haps—Miss Morton hardly does more than tactfully hint at that—of an American woman, contributes a large share to the comedy. It is a pleasure to add that the play, while making no heavy requirements as to equip ment, ia put on with liberal good taste. —W. B. Chamberlain. Foyer Chat.

A statement published by the land com missioner shows that the permanent school fund of the etate has $1,500,000 in r.ash at interest, most of the sum being in farm secu rities and the balance in local school and mu nicipal bonds. The fund is growing rapidly and baa been accumulated during the past ten years by the sale of lands that were donated by the general government when South Da kota became a state. In ten years more the fund will be several times greater than it is now, while only a small fraction of the lands will have been sold and converted into cash. In twenty years from this time the fund will practically :over the expense of conducting all the public common schools of the state. WARNED BY PIGEONS A flock of pigeons owned by a Philadelphia man gave an alarm of fire the other morn ing, and probably saved the lives of the inmates of the house. The pigeons are quar tered in a loft at the rear of the house, and when at 4 o'clock In the morning they set up a great fluttering and cooing, they awakened a boarder. He thought it strange conduct on the part of the birds at that unseemly hour, and got up to investigate. He found that the house was full of smoke, and lost no time In arousing the inmates, one of whom ran and turned in an alarm of fire. A defective flue was the cause of the fire, and damage to the extent of $500 had been done before the flames were extinguished. The pigeons were all saved. At Least One Otlier.

FKIDAY EVENING, DECEMBEB 6, 1901.N 1^ A ~ BT GEORGE W» D^iwf H^^9v*Bp^^P^"gß| ' ******* j?sfy■'C Copyright, 1901, by George W. Van Dyke. Old Trinity lhad just tolled the bour of 2 when John Paine alighted from a Broadway car at Wall street. Walking slowly down the "hill of millions" to William, street, he en tered the count ing-rooma of Charles Palms & Co., bankers and 1 brokers, and passed quickly 'through the main offices to the private room of the senior member of the firm. Paine was private secretary to Charles Palms, the Wall street financier and million aire. He lhad been in the firm's employ for fifteen years and bad worked his way from ofißce boy at $3 a week to private secretary ex $3,000 per year. Yet as be sat in the luxuriously fitted office be was not the happy-hearted "lucky dog" his associates deemed him, for he was in love —and ha told himself hopelessly—with beauti ful Margaret Palms, daughter and sole heir ess of his employer. It was hardly possible that the millionaire would accept his secreta ry as his son-in-law, even If Margaret Jack Palme's heart beat faster at the thought —did sha love him ? He knew the banker's dread that some man would marry his daughter for her rruwwy. He had told him in their confidential relations that no man should ever pay court to Marga ret unless he could prove b\a ability to sup port her unaided in the fashion to which eh* had been, accustomed. The old man had evi dently no suspicion of the rcmanee that heal been going on under bis very eyes. It had hM taken place during the last six weeks, while Mr. Palms was confined to his home on Fifth avenue with a fractured knee. His secretary brought him. every noon what ever papers demanded his personal attention and received further instructions. During these daily visits Jack found him self fast saicoumblngr to the young girl's charms. The more he struggled the deeper ha became engulfed in the all-absorbing pas sion. Margaret, too, had given him to un derstand, as only a woman can, that she cared for him, yet he dared not speak. To gain the coveted prize he must first convince her fa ther of his financial capabilities. This seemed impossible, for all that he pos sessed in the world beyond his salary were a few acres of non-productive Pennsylvania land, which he had purchased several years before during the oil boom. He recalled all this with a sigh. Then his face flushed with new-born hope as be. reread the letter received that morndns from his uncle, Charles Paine, a South Dakota mino expert: My Dear Nephew: Forgive haste and brev ity. The matter is urgent. The representa tives of the English syndicate are here to examine the Last Chance with a view to purchasing and operating it on a large scale if the experts report favorably. 1 am con vinced, from a cursory examination that they will do bo. The mine has not been operated lately on account of friction among the stockholders. The stock, lam told, is selling tor almost nothing in New York. Now, Jack, my boy, I am in a po&itlon to know twenty four hours ahead of the syndicate Just what the experts will report and will let you know by wire if favorable. I Inclose check for $16,400, every penny 1 possess, which you are to invest in Last Chance stock Immediately on receipt .of my wire. As lor yourself, my boy beg, borrow and steal every dollar you can' lay your hands on, and buy, buy, buy Last Chance. Your uncle, —Charles. "Yes," muttered Jack, as he settled himself more comfortably In his easy chair, "the first thing in tbe morning 111 accept Horgan & Eby's offer for my land. I hate to part with, it sit that figure, but it's my last chance." As he sat speculating dreamily on the hope that the letter had awakened In his heart, a clerk entered and handed him a tetegraaru Daily New York Letter Miss Cornelia Roosevelt Scovel. Doc. 6. —Miss Cornelia Roosevelt Scovel is one of the numerous attractive young rela tives of President Roosevelt who will be seen at the simart functions of New York and Washington society this winter. Miss Scovel and her mother, Mrs. Edward Scovel, who was a Miss Roosevelt, and who Is a first cousin of the president, will eail to-day from England for this city. A Banklngr Combine. Charles W. Morse, "ice Jping-," telephone tfromoter and financier, obtained control of the National Hide and Leather bank, making eight banks in New York city where his word is law. It is also reported Wall street and banking circles that Mr. Morse had bought up a majority of the stock <jf the Na tional Bank of North America. TMs was de nied at the bank, the denial being supple mented by the statement that not a saile of the bank's stock (had been made within, a year. The eight banks whk-h this new etar In the financial firmament absolutely controls are the Hide and Leather, New Amsterdam, Broadway, Garfield and Commercial, all na tional banks, and the Bank of the State of New York, Twelfth Ward and Gansevoort banks, state institution's. Their combined capital is $4,550,000 and the aggregate of their deposits $32,318,200. Mr. Morse is alro a director and practically the dominant factor m the Produce Exchange and Sprague National banks, whose combined (Rpital Is $1,200,000 and aggregate deposits $5,231,700. A Killing In Cotton. Theodore Price whose firm of Prtce, Mc- Cormick & Co. failed for over $10,000,000 about two years a«o, -when Mr. Price was trying to corner the market for cotton, was one of the largest winners in the heavy advance made in that staple Tuesday. He Is said to have been "long" of about 75,000 bales, on whion lie averaged a gain of $3 a bale. Yesterday he took profits on 2?,000 bales which he bought below 7VS cents a pound, above 8 cents. Price is »aid to have formed a syndicate of Wall strwt operators, who bought about 30, --000 balos on his recommendation. Their gains were large. Found In a Dissecting Room. After nearly six months' search the body of Robert B. F. Walsh, at one time a well known resident of Brooklyn, was found by his son in the dissecting room of the College of Physicians and Surgeons. It will be sent back to the Bellevue morgue and then claimed by the dead man'a relatives. On July 14 a man, who said he was Robert B. F. Walsh, 62 years old, was found unconscious and taken to Bellevue. He died on July 21. The body was taken to the morgue and a card con taining the death notice wai sent addressed to "The friends of Robert B. F. Walsh, 32 Hudson avenue, Brooklyn." No word was received from the man'a friends. About that time Robert B. F. Walsh, an inventor, in comfortable circumstances and living at 132 Park avenue, Brooklyn, disap peared. He was employed by the government at Montauk Point. For several months his relatives searched, trying to find the man, but without avail. "A son of Walsh called at the morgue and in looking ov«r the records discovered the name Robert B. F. Walsh. Young Walsh then learned that his father's body had been 6ent to the potter's field, but on July 30 had been taken back to the city and to the dissecting room. A Daredevil Deed. The feat of W. 3. Merrill, Harvard, '04, who ate three steaks, two mutton chops, two dish es of peas, and djTan'k two pints of water and two cups of coffee last night for a }3 wager, is dwarfed in the estimate of the other stu dents and the residents of thilß city by the feat of J. A. Whltehead, another Harvard student who Is visiting friends in Yale, In cllmblrag the East Rock, a granite cliff nearly 400 feet high, in front of which stands the soldiers' monniment. The rock Is a sheer precipice, and for 100 feet offers only the slightest hold for foot or hand, but Whltehead climbed to the top of It, where he fell almost exhausted, while the »houts of several hundred students and others who had gathered to watch hia perilous ascent rang Indistinctly in bis ears. ' •■">u'^ Whltehead risked his life, for a misstep at any stage of his upward progress after he (had gone twenty i feet would ? haveJ meant ? death. Ho Is still suffering from the nervous strain. Jack took th» yellow envelop anil, hastily tearing It open, read: Keport O. K. Buy at any price. Sell at no price. —Charles Paine. "Eureka!" he cried. Jumping to Mb feet. "If any on© asks for me, I am gone for the day." Grabbing his hat, he rushed from the office and hurried up the street. "There is yet time," he muttered, glancing up at Trinity's clock is he entered the Drexel building, where the offices of Horgaa & Ebf were located. It was just half past 2. Shortly after 3 o'clock he emerged from the same building richer by fIO.OOO, but no longer the owner of the Pennsylvania land. The Mining Exchange was startled the fol lowing morning by the wonderful activity of Last Chance, a stock long considered a "sleeper." The wild rumors that flew about the street credited the rise to old man Palms. The stock bounded from 25 to 50 to 100 and then to 200 per share amid great excitement, which increased to frenzy when it became known that Palms' private secretary was ac tively engaged in the deal. At 1 o'clock Last Chance stood at 300. Bending over the ticker i« the private office of Palms & Co., with stern and haggard face, stood Jack Paine, nervously running the tape through his fingers. It seemed to say to him over and over again, with its r-r-r-r, ti-tick, tl-tick, tick: "Last Chance is up, up, up!" until Last Chance sold at 850. He stood for a moment as If dazed by tha sudden fortune that was now his, and then ashe thought of Margaret he flew to the outer offfce, already crowded with excited brokers. He would close his deals. No; there was only on hour more before tho exchange closed. He would wait till morning. His fortune might then be doubled, for the syndicate had un doubtedly acted by this time. He ordered a hansom. He must carry tha news to Margaret. While waiting he received the congratula tions of his friends. Already he heard him self called a Napoleon of finance. The han som arrived. He ran to the inner office for his hat. R-r-r, tl-tlck, ti-tick, tick. Ho would take ono more look before going. What was that he saw? "Last Chance 2701" No; It could not be. His eyes had deceived him—r-r-r-r, tl-tick, tli-tick, tick—l* C. 250! Cold perspiration stood on his forehead. Again that ominous ticking, again and again, and down, down, down went Last Chance until with scarcely a rally it broke to 75. He stood by the ticker fascinated, and as the tape ran through his nerveless fingers be felt his fortune slipping through his grasp —ti-tlck, ti-tick, tick. L. C. 50! A deadly faintness seized him. L. C. 20! He gasped for breath. One more pom; against him and he was a ruined man. R-r-r-r, ti-tlck, tick—L. . a 19—and the clock struck 2. "Margaret, my love/ he cried wildly, "I have lost you!" "Jack," cried a sweet voice In his ear, "you have been dreaming!" It was Margaret, and the next moment ha was telling her of his unpleasant dreams. "I am glad that I was the one to wake you," she whispered. "It ought to be a good omen. Papa wanted some papers from the bank, and as I had some errands in the neighborhood I volunteered to get them." At this inopportune moment a messenger boy entered. "A telegram, air." Jack tore it open and read: We are authorized to offer $300,000 for your Pennsylvania property. Wire answer. —Ooldmark & Morgan. He forgot the waiting boy as he caught tho girl in his arms, crying: "We have struck oil!" The feat was accomplished at night, ag Whitehead did not care to have too large a crowd watching him. He was prompted to try the ascent of the cliff by hearing other students telling of the Impossibility of do ing it. Whitehead was with a party that had been at a restaurant where liquid refreshments were imbibed freely. On the way home, as the party passed the soldiers' monument, one student remarked: "I'd like to see the man who could climb that rock." "Would you?" said Whitehead. "Well, I'll gratify your desire." He thereupon approached the side of the cliff and began the ascent. Slowly the student climbed. He rested at every new foothold. Before he climbed far his fingers were torn and bruised by the rock, but he could not turn back. The men watching Whltehead were almost afraid to move or talk, fearing the slightest commotion would cause him to lose his grasp on the naked rock. Gradually the young fellow worked his way up, and in a time, which seemed an age to the watchers, he reached the top and fell exhausted. Whitehead was assisted to his quarters and a physician dressed the Injuries to his fingers. He said that several times during the ascent he almost lout his balance and felt so dizzy that he saw death staring him in the face. A Prince Studies locomotives. Prince Yoshio Yamarnotc of Japan, who hag been taking a course of practical instruction in locomotive building in the Pennsylvania railroad shops, has announced his Intention of remaining in this country for three years as a special apprentice in the special depart ments of the Pennsylvania system. After completing his studies and investigations in the United States Prince Yamarnoto will enter the imperial railway service in Japan. A Family- Affair. It was entirely a family alTalr when Mrs. Edna Wallace Hopper, a vision in frills and furbelows with a naughty little hat. entered the professional woman's league bazaar at the Waldorf-Astoria yesterday with Joseph Loiter, the Chicago plunger, by her side. She soon ran across Mrs. Hopper No. 2. Mr. Letter visited the voting booth where con testants for the brooch to be bestowed upon the most popular actress occupied a bulletin board and bought 500 chances for Edna Wal lace. This done the couple progressed from booth to booth till the doll table wns reached. The little aotrees is represented in her "Flnro dora" role by a charming dollie, Mr. Lelter was no sooner made aware of this fact than he was fired with a desire to possess the sawdust prototype. "Who is in charge here?" Mrs. Hopper asked. "Mrs. Dewolf Hopper," replied Anni« Thornton. Mrs. Edna Wallace Hopper drew herself up with dignity. "Oh, indeed. No dolla for me, thank >^ " And with Mr. Leiter in tow away shs salle*^ "I say," Inquired William Courtlelgh, walk ing up to a tall woman near by, "can you tell me who that is with little Mrs. Hopper?" "Sir: 11 ejaculated the tall one in tones trembling with Indignation, and Mrs. Dewolf Hopper No. 2 faced afound upon her ques tioner. AS
