Bryan, en routs to hla home in Lin coln, N'eb.. arrived hera today from Washington, meeting hie wife and daughter .who are bound for New York, whtnee they will .all for Eu rope Saturday. Mr. Bryan will not KccoUipuny them, he said, a he has lecture engagement, which will keep hfm engaged for some time. Mr. Bryan was reluctant to discuss President Roosevelt' message to Con gress, saying that he bad not had suf ficient time to read It through. He. however, commented freely on several of the most Important Issues, and gave President Roosevelt credit for Intro ducing an original proposition in sug gesting the appropriation of campaign funds by the Government. "I hope," he said, "that It will be enacted Into a law." On Important questions Mr. Bryan's Ideas coincide with the text of the message. He I. strictly in accord with the President concerning postal savings banks and guaranteed banks. He said: "The ulan of the guaranteed bank Is simply this: Statistics show the average loss to depositors to be very small, taking all the banks together, but the depositors .are afraid because they do not know much about the af fairs of any particular bank. The Postmaster Oeneral, In recommending the postal savings banks, called atten tion to the fact that a large sum of money Is sent back to the Government banks of Europe by people who are afraid to trust the private banks here, and Mr. Wanamaker has ( been quoted as saying that a large sum is kept in hoarding. During the last forty years the average loss among National banks has been less than 1-10 of 1 per cent of deposits, and as we have passed through two panics in that time. It is not likely that the average loss will be' greater drulng the next forty yeara. "To sum up the situation, the depos itors need protection, and this must either be given by the postal savings banks, which will grow until it ha. absorbed the deposit banking of trfe country, or It must be furnished through the guarantee of existing banks."
