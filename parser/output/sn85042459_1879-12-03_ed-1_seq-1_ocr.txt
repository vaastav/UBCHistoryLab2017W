Virginia City, Dec. I.—Last night seven out of twenty-two prisoners broke jail here, and es caped by making a hole through the wall under the window. Two benches were set up and the table put across for a platform. Blankets were used to prevent uoise, and the hole was made easily ou account of the defective mortar used iv its construction. The principal escapes are Michael Langan alias "Red Mike," murder er of Pat Leonard; Mark Brown, horse-thief, and three burglars, named Bchofleld, LatTerty aud Rosenbaugb, alias "Klein." None have yet been retaken. Noinluallona by (lie President. Washington, Dec. I.—The Pres ident scut the following nomina tions to the Senate to-day: George W.

Other Democrats, like Singleton and Chalmers, think It wise to continue the struggle. Bee<jner on Jesus -sruuiliinnu Vl s-riuae. Nkw York, Deo. I.—The World has a strong article on the utter ances of Beecber yesterday, iv which It says: Even the local au thorities of San Francisco have drawn the line recently at Passion plays, aud though yesterday was the Urst Sunday in Adveut, we think our readers will agree with us that Baecber, in his eagerness to give vivacity to his teachings, overstepped the limits which divide tlie sensational from the scandalous Iv sermonizing. Tbe following is a syuopsiaed report of Reseller's language above ulluded to: "Who was Jesus? A peasant, a mechanic at a period of the world when work men were very low in the social scale; and if one had asked who was this Divinity whom you worship, he would huvesald, Jesus. Of what country? Nazareth. Who were bis parents? Joseph and Mary, reputedly. Who was his mother? Mary, who just escaped divorce through the magnanimity of her betrothed. Who was his father? No oue. What was his country? Judea—a Jew—a bastard Jew. What did he do? Workec as a oarpenter iv the shop of hh putative lather. What became o him? He was charged with a vio lotion of the Roman laws, tried aud convicted and put to death. A bastard Jewish mechanic; a male raclor put to death for violating the laws of his country! Is that Ihe fellow you bring to me for worship' Now, If you look at things from the surface, Jesus Is that, and tha only; and Paul, having the high est training, might easily hay thrown over all tho poetic veil o mystery." ■,mmnl tMeaMWM M MM roa elliuitou. — nee.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Both Houses of Congress met at noon yesterday, and after per fecting their organization, tlie President's Message was received and read. It is a voluminous doc ument, and gives a very complete survey of the political and econom ical condition of the country. It alludes with sati-fartion to the great and rapid increase nf our foreign commerce, giving a large balauce of trade in our favor, and improving the public credit by the attraction of gold to our country from abroad. The progress of re funding has made an annual sav ing iv interest of 514,297,177. The amount of national debt which matures within leSB than two years is $792,121,700, of which $500,000, --000 bears interest at the rate of five per cent. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be tefunded by the issue of four per cent, bonds, and by tbe reduction of interest which will thus be af fected, about $11,000,000 can be an nually saved to the Treasury. It asks Congress to refrain from ac tion on the subject of establishing a legal relation of value between gold and silver, in view that the leading commercial Nations of Eu rope are endeavoring to agree upon one rate. A SOP TO THE 

NATIONAL BANKS. Tlie message says that the retire ment front circulation of United Btates notes, with capacity of legal tender iv private coutracts, is a step to be taken for its progress to ward a safe and stable currency, Which should be accepted as tbe policy and duty of the Govern ment nnd Hie security of the peo ple. It is my Urm conviction that the issue of legal lender paper money, based wholly upon Ihe au thority and credit of the Govern ment, except in extreme urgency, is without warrant In the C'oustitu- lion and In violation nf sound financial principles. It is recom mended that the existing laws for' the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt under a limited period be maiutained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation Is deemed uecessary hy Congress, it ia suggested that experience has shown that a duly can be placed on tea aud coffee which will not en hance the price of those articles lo the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars annually to the treasury. 

POLYGAMY, ETC. Tlie message recommends more striugeut provisions to tbe law aimed at tlie suppression of polyg amy in Utah, and suggests tbe withdrawal or withholding of the rights and privileges of those who, in the Territories, violate the law. It asks Congress to remedy any defects iv the laws so aa to secure the free exercise of tlie right of suf frage to all citizens. It devotes a paragraph to Civil Service Reform, and declares that what lias already been done in that direction has been beneficial to the public service. It requests Con gress lo make the necessary appro priation for the resumption of the work of the Civil Service Commis sion, which has been suspended for some time tor want of means to go on. In this connection the message deuounces the practice of making levies for party purposes upon tbe salaries of public officers. THE CHINESE QUESTION. The message says on the subject of Chinese immigration, that tbe Government of China has signified its willitigness to consider tbe ques tion of the emigration of its sub jects to the United Slates with a dispassionate fairness, and to co operate ln such measures as may tend to prevent injurious conse quences to the Uniled States. The negotiations are still proceeding ami will be pressed with diligence THE MEXICAN AWARD—ISTHMUS CANAL, ETC. Tlie third instalment of tlie Mcx loan award has been put In coursi of distribution, and in conneclioi with this subject the Preaitlen draws a highly satisfactory pictur of tlie good feeling existing be tween the two Governments—! feeling which he believes will lesi to an expansion of our trade wltl Mexico, and au increased contribu tlon of the capital and industry c our people to the development c thegr.at lesources of that country He recommends legislation look lug to th:'- result. Alluding to the resumption of di plomatic relations wilh Colombie he says It is fortunate in view t tbe great interest now felt in a lnter-oceanlc canal.

WEDNESDAY MORNING, DEC. 3. 1879. Hie capital for its completion would readily be furnished from tbiscoun try and Europe; which might, fail ing such guarantees, prove inacces sible. THE INDIAN PROBLEM. The message calls upon Congress to organize some form of govern ment over the Territory of Alaska, and then summarizes tbe reports of Cabinet officers. Treating of that of the Secretary of tbe Interior on Indian affairs, it recommends the enactment of a law "enabling tlie Government to give Indians a title in fee, inaiieuabie' for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment and also repeat the recommendation made iv my first annual message that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their families for a number of years and who are willing to detach them selves from their tribal relations, to tbe benefit of the Homestead Act, and to grant them patents containing the same provision of inalienabllity|for a certain period. The message recommends that no change be made iv the control of the ludiau service. THE 

SUPREME COURT. Tlie Message shows that the bus iness of the Supreme Court is large ly in arrear, and that no assiduity ou (he part of the Justices can ac complish more than is now done. The remedy suggested hy the At torney-General is the appointment of additional Circuit Judges, and the creation of au intermediate Court of errors aud Appeals which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of Its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. The President commands this sugges tion to tbe consideration of Con gress. TIMBER LANDS ETC. The message recommends that a law be enacted enabling the Gov ernment to sell timber from pub lic lauds without conveying fee where such lands are principally valuable for timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to con form to domestic wants aud busi ness requirements, while at the same time it guards against the sweeping destruction of forests. The message also recommends au increased appropriation for tbe De partment of Agriculture, the en couragement of education, and a provision for the National Library; also recommends an appropriation for the completion of the Wash ington monument, aud the adop tion of a generous policy towards the District of Columbia, especially iv the matter of repairing streets now rendered useless and endang ering the health of the city; It also invites the favorable consideration by Congress to the wants of the common schools of the District of Columbia.
