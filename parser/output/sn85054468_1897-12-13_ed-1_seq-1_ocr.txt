He routed the neigh bors, and learning the name of the mur derer, from one of the children who sur vived Its teirlblc wounds a short time, the hunt for Lew Is vv as begun.

Others wanted to burn him at the stake, but it was finally decided to let him live one rnoic day and have a preliminary trial. State Senator Weathersby, Rev. Dr. Drummoud and others pleaded that the law be permitted to take Its course. Tlie erowd began to waver, when all of a sudden a long, tall backwoods woman burstinto the circle and demanded: "Do you call yourselv es meu Have you no vies and Children of your own' Men of three counties, do your duty. Tie the varmint to tl tree, pile the knots of fat pmo to his chin, and I'll set 'em afire with my own hands."' This threw the mob into a frenzy.

The six-day bioycle riders who finished thplr long fturncy In Mndison Square Garden last night en joyed a much-needed rc,t today, and to night they did not show tlie Jgns of the terrible strain. Despite sensational re ports that tev eral or the riders had become insane or had been carried half dead to hospitals, the fact remains that not one ot them was unable to eat Heartily and take a short walk hi the afternoon- Miller, the winner of tbo contest, was In such good shape when in left the Garden that he slept touudly IiK-five hours. He will receive $1,300 in pur-e money nnd about $500 more in bonuses. Bice surprised ids rriquds bj walking up Fc)urtn avenue this afternoon. He said that he riept for seven hours. Sohiuueer wa alK In, good condition when ho awoke atter a good night's rest. Hale, arter eight hour sleep, sat up in bed and read the papers: "I knew the track was short," he stud, "but that docs not detract rrom Millers wonderful per formance." Waller and Pierce were out on the street early todav. Pierce condemned tlie persons who cir culated the report that ' was out of his mind. "I'm not crazy now, that's cer tain," he remarked, "ami I'm just as Mine at the present-moment ah I wus all through the race." The managers of the ru il)3WW,ha track measured and surveyed" a civil engi neer this morning. The., founCL it to be short, but refused to giv out any state ments until tomorrow. Then the riders will receive, in addition w their money, their official records, computed ou the correct measurement of tlie track. C W. Ashlnger, who built the courtc, and swore in an affidavit that It was correct in length, being 086 feet, 7 inches, a mitted today that he had made a nthnnk. Ho contends, however, that the track was ot correct measurement uiu Thanksgiving night, when Michael and Starbuck had their race. Pince that? time alteratioiss were necessary. As It now stands all the records by short distance men during the present week will not be accepted by the L. A, W., and there will be n pretty rigid investigation before the revised long distance figures are pronounced official. The shortness of the track places the L. A. W. officials, who had Charge ot things, in a somewhat embarrassing po sition. The probability of holding another 142 hour race in tills city is quite remote. It is suggested that long distance contests, should be limited to 1UH hours o'f riding In siv days, that the men should be com pelled to rest about fceven hours out of the twenty-four, and th$lr number limited lo twenty-five. lVEYI.i:i
