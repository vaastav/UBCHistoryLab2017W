But the people themselves, far more than tkeiritineer ih pubUe station, are mteretel In a pure, eeo HOmleal and vigoioua Administration, liy laws enacted in PM ami 1H6A. and now In sub stanee lntsirMrKti-d in the Hevited iHatute, the praetlce of arbitrary apioHttnciits to the several subonllndtH grades in the great De partments was emHlemnei, and examlna livna h.1 to capaelty, to be eomluctel by the Departmental Hoards of Kxamlneis, were provided for and made conditioned admission to the public service. These statutes are a de elslon bvCongress that examlHatioiw of some sort aa to attainments and capacity are essen tial to the welbbolnff of the pulIlo service. The Important questions since thu enactment of theee laws have been as to the character of thCMi examinations, and whether oltlclai favor and partisan inMut-uec. or common right and merit were to oonttol the iteoeM to the examl imtloits. In practice these examina tions have not always been open to worthy person generally who might wish to be exrmlHt!. Omelal favoritism and partisan Influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the Kxnmlulng Hoards, subjecting even the Examiners to a preesuro from the friends of the candidate very illlfleult to re sist, As a consequence, the standard of ad mission fell below that which the public In terest demanded. It was almost inevitable that a system which provided for various separatu Hoard of Examiners, with no com mon supervision or uniform method of pro cedure, shotibl result iu confusion, inconsist ency, and Inadequate tests or capacity highly detrimental to tho public interest. A fuwher and more radical change was obviously re quired. In the annual message or Decem ber, 1870, my predecessor declared that "there Is no duty wh(eh so much embar rasses the Executive and heads or Depart ments as that of appointments, nor Is there any inch arduous duties and thankless labor Im posed on Senators and Itepreseututlvr-a a that or rinding places for ennsiltueiit. The pres ent system docs not secure the best men, and nftennni even tit men, tor the publlo places, l'foo elevation nnd purification of thu Civil Service of theUovermnent will lie hailed with approval by the whole people of the United 3iatcs." Congress accordingly passed the act Miproved March ii, 1871, "To retaliate the Civil Perrloe of the United States and promot the eificlenoy thereof," giving tho necessary nuthorityto the Executive tninsugurHtonUlv lbHervleo reform. Acting under this statute, which was Interpreted us Intended to secure a system or Just and effectual examinations un der uniform sujiervislon, a number of emi nently competent persons were selected for thopiiiT0"- who entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared with an in telligent appreciation of the requirements of the service and the regulations contemplated, and took charge of thocxamiuatlons, and who, iu their capacity as a Hoard, have been known as the CIvtl-Servlee Commission. Congress for two yearn appropriated the money ueeiieti for the compensation uhd for the oxikiim of earrylnjr on tbo work of tho Commis sion, it appears from then-port or the Com mislou, submitted to thn President iu April, U'.i, that examinations had lwn held In vin fous sections of tbo eountry, and that an appropriation of alur Saft.Otf) would Ih re quired to meet the annual expenses, Including salaries, Involved In discharging the duties of the Commission. The rcHrt was transndlted to Congress by special .mowage of April IH, is", with tho following lavorablo comment upon the lalorsf the Commission: "If sus tained by Congress, I havo no iloubt the rules can, after the exiterioneo waniosl, Ihjso lmproveil and onfortatd as to still more mate rbulv benertt tho public service, tun! relieve the Kxifiitivo, members ot .Congress and the heads of Departments from I ntluenees preju dicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto been unforced, have te fiilted beneficially, as Is ahowii by the opinions of thn mcmbots of tho Cabinet and their subordinates in the Depart ments, and iu that opinion I con cur." And la the annus'. message of Decemlterof thn same year similar views are expressed and an appropriation for con tinuing the work or the CommlssioH again ad vised. Tho appropriation was not made, mid, m a consequence, the active work or the Commission was suspended, leaving tho Com mission Itseir still In existence without the means therefore of causing qualifications to be tested In any systematle manner, or of se curing for the pubHo service the advan tage's of competition upon any extensive plan. 1 recommended in my antiunl messago of December, 17T, the making or an appropria tion forthe resumption of the work of the Commission. Iu the meantime, however, competitive examinations, tinder many em iwrrassmcuts, have lieen conducted within limited spheres in the Executive Departments in Wushingtou, and In a number of tho cits-toin-boue aad poet-nine of the prin cipal cities of the. eountry, with a view to further test their effects, and In every instance thoy havo been found to lie as salutary as ihoy are atated to bnve been under tho Administration of my proueoessor. l think theecouomy.pi efficiency of ihe nubile service would urity and no great- ly promoted by their systetnatlo introduction, wherever practicable, thnnighout tbo entire Civil Service of the Government, together with ample provision for their general super vision, In order to secure consistency and uni form justice lb-ports from the Secretary of the Interior, from tho Postmastor-General, from the Post niHster In the City of N"ew York, where such examinations have tan-it Tor ioiiiotlmoontrial, and also from the Collector of tho Port, the Naval Oltieers and the Surveyor In that city, and from tho Postmasters and collectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has in va rious ways contributed to Improve tho public service. The reports show that the re sults havo been salutary In a marked degree, and that a general application of similar rules cannot fall to tie of decided benefit to the service, Thu reports of the Uovenimesvt officers in tlm City of New VoiTt twpectnlly beardeelded testimony to the utility of open competitive examination in their respective offices, showing that these examinations, and the excellent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them, have bad a marked Incidental effect euon t he Drapns pre viously In t.ie service, am particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been on the part or the latter an Increased inter est In tho work, and a desire to extend ac quaintance with It lieyond tho jwrtioular desk occuplcd.and thus tho mnralo of the entire force has been raised. Tho examinations have been attended bv many citizens, who havo hac an opportunity to thoroughly Investigate tht scope and character of the tests, and tht BU'tHOUOi uetemuning ine resuus. nnu iniwit visiters have without exception approved tut methods employed, and several of them have putilieiy attestcuincir tavora in ij opinion. Upon such considerations I deem my ditty reeotmnenda tlort Dece tho i to renew ine contained In my atttittni message on win ihi iiHiowmw "Cl V" lu JL" mlier, 1877, requesting Congress to makt ot otner Treaty rowers, ine at tent ion oiuon- lieOCSSary appropriations tor tllO rCSUmp jrwih mrmii iimirii in laHBtiuimiv m mem- .,r .i, ,l'.irv.if ,t,i. rivit-mirvicrt finnmi Jcmnitv funds received some veers since from slon.

NVCATIOIM. Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful. With Great Itritaln there are still unsettled qireatloiM, growing out of the local laws of tlm maritime prov inces, and the notion of provincial authori ties deemed to lie In derogation of rights se cured by treaty to American fishermen. The United .States Minister In london Has lieen instructed to present a demand for f l(..ue in view or the damages received by American oiilzeiiK at Fortune flay on tho 6th day or J mili ary, 187. The subject has been taken Into consideration by the llrltish Government, ami an early reply is anticipated. Upon the com pletion or the necessary preliminary examin ation, the subject or our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at onoe Im brought to tho attention or the llrltish Government with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which was only temporarily ad justed by tho Treaty of Washington. Efforts nave In-en made to obtain the removal of restrictions found Injurious to the exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and procrty upon tho lakes, which ha resulted in imiKrtniit niodiHeations or the previous regu lations ol the Dominion Government on this subject. In the interest of humanity and com merce. In accordance with the Joint resolution of the last session of Congress, Commissioners were appointed to represent the United States at tho two International Exhibitions In Aus tralia, one of which Is now in progress at Syd ney, mid the other to bo held next year at Melbourne. A desire has been ex pressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested In tho Important and growing trado with Australia that an Increased provision should lie made by Congress for the represen tation of our Industries at the Melbourne Ex hibition ot next year, and the subject is re- spect fully ! sldcratkm. suutnnteu to your tavorauie oou- The assent of the Government has been given to the landing ou the coast of Massa chusetts of a new and Independent transat lantlo cable lietween franco (by way of the French Island of St. Pierre) and this country, subject to any future legislation of Congreet on the subject. The conditions Imposed, be fore almwtng this connection with our shores to bo established, are such as o secure Its competition with any existing or future lines of marine cable, and pre clude amalgamation therewith, and to pn vide for entire equality of rights to our Government and people with those of France iu the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive poesslon of theprlvflego as accorded by France to the disadvantage of any ruture cable communication between France and the United States which may Ikj project ed and accomplished by our citizens. An im portant reduction of the present rates of com munication with Europe, felt to bo too burden some to tho Interests of our commerce, must necessarily Howfrom theestatdishment of this competing line. The attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety of somo general regulation by Congress or the whole subject of tratwniarlne cables by my predecessor In his message of December 7, 1K and I re spectfully submit to your consideration the Imimrttinoe of Congressional action lu this matter. The questions of grave importance with Spsjn, growing out ot tho incidents of tho Cuban insurrection, have been forthe most part happily ami honorably settled. It may reasonably bo anticipated that the Commis sion now sitting In Washington for tho de cision of private caoa iu this connection will soon bo able to bring its labors to a con clusion. The long-standing question of the East Florida claims baa lately Iwcn renewed as a subject of correspondence, ami may pos sibly require Congressional notion for Its final disposition. A treaty with tho Netherlands with respect to Consular rights and trivll eges similar to those with other powers has been signed and ratified, and tho ratiflcatious were exchanged on the 81st of July last. Negotiations ror extradition tn-:itios with J tho Netherlands and with Denmark are now In progress. Isomo questions with Switzerland In regard to pauper and convict emigrants have arisen, but It Is not doubted that they will bearranged upon a Just and satisfactory basis. A ques tion has also occurred with respect to an as serted claim by Swiss municipal authorities to cxerclso tutelage over the jwrsons ana property of Swiss citizens jiaiuralrzod in this country. It is possible this may require ad justment by treaty. WitH the German Em pire frequent questions arise in eonneettou with the subjects of naturalization and expa triation, but the Imperial Government has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipula tions lu regard to them. Iu consequence of the omlslon of Congress to provide for a dldomtle representative at Athens, tho Legation to Gieeco has been with drawn. There is now no clmuncl of diplo matic communication between tho two coun tries, and the expediency of providing for one in some form Is submitted to Congress. Relations with Austria, Hussla. Italy, Portu gal, Turkey nnd llelglum continue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial Impor tance. A change of tho personal head of the Gov ernment of Egypt has taken place. No change, however, has occurred In the relations between Egypt and tho United States. The notion of tbo Egyptian Government In presenting to tho City of Now York ono of the ancient obelisks which possess auch historical interest Is highly appreciated as a generous mark of International regard. If prosperity mould attend tho enterprise of its transporta tion across the Atlantic, Its erection In a eon inlcumMnosition lu the chief commercial oltv t of the Nation will lie soon accomplished. t Tho treaty recently madebctween Janan and It tho United States In regard to tho revision of former commercial treaties, it Is now lielleved, , ?migrat on ot us suojecw to tno uniteu htates with a jtllspasslonate fairness, and toco-oierate la suob measures as may tend to prevent Injurious consequences to the Unit- sd 'States. Tho negotiations are still pro cedlng, and will lie pressed with diligence. A jucstlon having arisen between China and Ja- ran about the Loochuo Islands, tho United tales Government tms taken measures to In- 1 form those powers of its readiness to extend ,ts good offices for the maintenance or peace, f they shall mutually deem It desirable, and Smj k practicable to avail themselves of tha THKHoamcH KAtna, tr is ft rrsttHestiou to be able to announce 1 under tho Instructions, .of under tno uiitructHms. m inen; n spectJw Udvvmmunti, raids nnd depre dations have greatly decreased nmu In locali ties whOro they were rormerly most destruc tive, have now almost, wholly ceased, lit vluvr of this result, I entertain a confident nxpecta lion that tho or.ntlniwnco or thH prcvalente of qukit on tho bonier will soon beeonio ti) as sured as to JitdUy a mmtlflCiUloM or the pres ent orders to mir military commanders as to oreselfHr the border without eeiHfltHf.tb HsWUIlMUUMfesl U WJIM III f bo tsf thetwf eowitrtos. i ne itHrai mm mum Mexlei Master CMi I, iw wj duly wild, eounw of dlstrlbutHMi nfrress provWmg for the tame.

I earnestly oommend to the wisdom of Congress the provision of suitable legiatar tintihMiklngtothlsressstt. , , Dlldomatlu intercourse with Colombia la again fully restored by the arrival of the Minister from that emwtry to the United States. This is especially fortunate in a lew of the fset that the question of an Inter-oeiMiale eanal has recently assumed a new and impor tant aMMfct ami in nOw under diseussmn with the Central Amenesn con ntries,th rough whose terrltor" tho oansl by the Nicaragua route would have to pas. It i trusted that enbght ened statesmanship on their tmrt will see that the early prosecution of sneb wirk will largely inure to the ben efit, not only of their own citlsens ami those of the United States, but of the commerce of tno civilized world. It is not doubted that, shouhl the work beundertaken under the pro teetive unsplces of tho United States, and upon satisfactory concessions fr the right of way and Its security by the Central American Governments, the capital for it cow plot lea would readily tm furniehei) from this eountry and Europe, which might, failing aach guar antees, prove inaccessible. Diplomat le rela tions with Chill havoalso been strengthened by the rt'oeptlon of a Minister from that etmnlry. The war lietween Peru, Hollvla ami Chill still continued. The United States have not deemed It proper to lntcnmse In the mat ter, further than toeonvey to all the Gov ernments concerned tho assurance that the friendly cittce of the Government or the United States for Ihe restoration or peace upon an honorable bast will lie extended in case the liclligcrents fball exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cordial relations lontlnue with Ilrazll and thn Argentine lteimlHle, and trado with those countries is improving. A provision for regular and more frequent mull communication in our ships between the liorts of this country and tho nations or Soath America seomstonie to ikwerve tho attention of Congress as an essential precursor of an enlargeineutof ourcommeroo with them and an extension of our carrying trade. A recent revolution In Veneruela has been followed by thu establishment of a Provisional Government. This Government has not yet been formally recognised, ami it is deemed desirable to await the projweed action of the people, which is expected to give it the sanc tion of constitutional forms. A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan Islands to make surveys and tako possession ot the privileges ceiled to the United States by Samoa In the Harbor or Pago-Pago. A coaling nation is to lie etabltebed there, which will be conveclcnt and useful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic rclatlona trlth HoumanUt and Servla, now become Inde pendent soTcrelirattes, Is " present under consideration, and lathe subject of dlpkunatle eorresponde oo. There is a gratifying Increase of trade wltb nearly all European and American countries, and it it believed that with Judicious notion in regard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced, mid that American IHwJucts and manufactures will nnd new and expanding markets. The reports of diplomats and consular officers upon this subjeet. un der the system now adopted, have resulted in olttalnlng much valuable information, which 1ms lieen and will continue to be laid before Congrees and the public from time to Un,e . ALASKA. The third article of the treaty with Iltissia of March 3), 187, by which Alaska was ceded to the United States, provides that the inhab itants or the ceded territory, with the excep tion of the uncivilized native tribes, shall ba admitted to the enjoyment of all tne rights of citizens of the United States, ami shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoy ment of tbelr liberty, of property ami re ligion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may from lime to time adopt In regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country. Both the obligations ot this treaty and the necessities of the pcirnte require that some organized form of government over the Territory of Alaska lie adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of persoas charged with common law offenses, such as assault, robbery and murder, nnd no magis trate author! seil to Issue or execute p recess ia sacli case. Serious difficulties have al ready arisen from offenses of this chftraeter, not only anions; the original inhabitants, but among citizens or the United States and other countries who have cugaged in mining, Ash ing and other business operations within the Territory. A bill authorizing tho appoint ment of Justk-esof the Peace and Constables, and tho arrest aim detention of jiersons charged with criminal offenses, and providing for an appeal to United States Crntrts for the District ot Oregon In suitable cases will, at the proper time, be submitted to Congress.
