Wire Dally iQjtt Qlvee All the Looal News AMERICANISM CREED, "I Ldieve in the United States of America, and the prin ciples of freedom, justice, equality and humanity upon which it was founded and for which American patriots have given their lives and fortunes. " "1 believe it is my duty towards my country to love it ; to support its constitution; to obey its lawi; Jo respect hi flag; nnd to defend it against all enemies." KNOW YOUR NE'CHBORS. Mr. K. li. Waitc, secretary of the Shawnee Hoard of Com iiick'c, has been asking more pertinent questions. Here is his latest : Did you ever stop ,to think? Tliat a "Know Your Neighbor" movement should be started in snuie cities. 'lint in smaller cities and towns such a movement is not necessary, because in such towns it is a customary thing for fam ilies to know each other. That it would be interesting for all persons to check up today aud see how many families they know in the block in 'which they live. Th.'t in some instances some people do not know all the people living in their own boarding house, let alone knowing the people living next door. That if such a cheek were made and if neighbors would make it a point to meet each other and be neighborly, there would be a great influence in the spirit of good will in' the community and a greater co-operation for the common good. o T . .RESfECTFOR.LAW.. . v "' Every citizen will do well to ponder the following passage from President Harding's annual message to congress: "There is a call to make the alien respect our institutions while he accepts our hospitality. More, there is a demand for every living being in the United States to respect and abide by the laws of the Republic. - 1 "Let men who are lessening the moral fiber of the Republic, through easy contempt of the prohibition law, because they think it restricts' their personal liberty, remember that they set the example and breed a contempt for law which will ultimately dest oy the Republic." , t o JOB FOR A 

STATESMAN, Lloyd George, who has his moments of vision, said in a recent speech : "The supreme task of statesmanship at this hour is the paci fication of nations so that the p :oplc shall have leisure to devote themselves to the peaceful vocations of life, to fill the depleted reservoirs from which we all draw." So say we all of us. Hut where is the statesman equal to Jhat task? ( Or where, is the nation ready to support him, when hc submits his peace-making program which will necessarily ignore old prejudices and wrongs and put the soft pedal on narrow and short-sighted nationalism? o Whatever one may think about the message which Clemen ttVnu has brought to America, it is difficult to understand how anybody cati withhold admiral ion from him as a man. That a man past eighty years of ag-: should undertake such a task as "The Tiger" assigned to himself is amazing in itself. His physical vitality and mental energy mark him as a man the like of which the world has seldom seen. Long before they reach his age, most men have lost the fighting spirit and are ready to let the world go as it will, but not so with Clemenceau. Possibly it is because he has been so preoccupied with the things that have .constituted his life's interest that he has apparently, lost sight of time and is still young and vigorous despite Jhe tale which the calendar tells. His one absorbing passion is France, and if jiis mission to America should have no other effect, the example which he affords should serve as an inspiration to the loftiest patriotism. f ' ; o t The road to normalcy presents perils for publishers as well as to practically all other lines of business and industry. One of the large daily newspapers at Amarillo, Texas, was sold under the sheriff's hammer last week. Details were not disclosed by the press dispatch, but the trouble was probably clue to over-expansion fhiring the period when the peak of prosperity prevailed." In many instances, publishers,. Jike- other business men, lost their heads during those exciting days, existing plants being expanded and new ones established, which "were far in excess of requirements of the variousi fields after the business slump set in. As a conse quence, during the last two years there have been many failures, while in a number of cases consolidations have been effected. These movements have been inevitable in the process of readjust ment. With the single exception of paper, which still sells at pore than double the pre-war price, there has been jio reduction m the cost of producing newspapers, and this condition, coupled with a largely reduced volume of business, has caused difficulties 'jvhich have taxed the resources and ingenuity of publishers, every where. ,' :' ,. . i ; That Grady county is regarded as the most promising of all the prospective new oil fields now, is the opinion expressed by the .Oil editor of the Daily Oklahoman, in a news article which was printed last Sunday. In addition to the remarkable development that has taken place in the gas field which was opened when the h'g Nichlos No. 1 was brought in last July, the leasing by large $il companies in the southeastern part of the county is now Attracting much attention. The general opinion among oil men jow seems to be that Grady county is a "good bet." . 1 ? o .. ...
