A very smart wool anlndle wu perpetrated recently between Pittsburgh >n<l Washington aoanty, by wbioh Homebody wu ohleeled out or (3,060, tlie ptloe ol tetin thousand ponnds or An* wool. A young nun, niime Bud plaoe unknown, went to Barker & Co., wool denier* or Pllisbortr, und repre ented himself ten ion o( John Dinsmore, of Washington county, who wu about to remove from the counly end bed despatched the eon to negotiate the aule of * large lot of fine wool. The price was agreed on and the firm delivered hlui ssolcs to pot the wool Into. This sharp youug man then vis iieu Mr. uinnmore, represented hlmlelf iih tbe agent of Barker A Do., bought Mr. Dlnsmore's wool, furnished Barker A Co 'a. saoks and took it away, with Uia un daring that Mr. Dinimore wonld call on he llrm in a few days for hla pay, offering Mr. D. a check on Pittsburgh If he preferred. Sharp youug man look the wool to Barker A Co., deliverMl It aa Dlnttmore'a aon, received the money for it aud left. The result was Lhat wlion Mr. Dlnsmore oalled for hla money there were a good many explanations to make, and a good deal of as* Lonishtneut wheu they were made. Dinaraore had sold hia wool to a fellow who watt not the agent of Baker A Co., ad itiey had bought hla wool of a fellow who waa not hia Hon, and paid for it; and this tellow had disappeared with the inouey. Mr. Dlnsmore claims the wool because he never got any pay for it, and Barkor A Co. claim It because they paid for it. The result la a autC In the courta to see whose wool 1L la. WAHUHKiTOM. Wabhiwoton, Dec. 15. TIIF.ouuan question in thb brnatb, The Cuban discussion In .the Senate to day drew out a pretty good attendance of intereated persona. Mr. Car* penter's speech waa carefully prepared, and abounded in felloltous phrases. He read it with force and feeling, but hardly came up to the popular expectation ontheaooreof oratory. Mr. Sumner briefly supported the posltlpn taken by the President on the question of belligerency, and held that ihere waa no legal way for preventing the departure ot tbe Spanish gunboata. It la learned that tbe queattonaoonneoted with them were Informally talked over between Secretary Fish and tbe membera of both tbe Congressional Foreign Committees at a dinner he gave to them last night lie la reported aa having BtHted all the pointa of the correspondence about the gunboata, bnt it does not appear there ia anything of special importance in it beyond what la already generally known to tbe public. He expressed warm sympathy for tbe Cubans, but said there was no way of aiding them without violation of law. He la making ont a copy of many ol tne documents on ille in the Department for (he Senate, which will undoubtedly furnleh Bome correct Information on the affairs of the island. Mr. Sumner said to-day that he does not know whejjier tbe Cubans have or have not declared for the abolition of slavery, and censured Spain lor having failed to take steps In that direction. He read a dispatch stating that many of the gunboata wero expected to uo to Ben this afternoon. lNOIlKARK OF 

BANKING FACILITIES! There in strong probability that a majority of tbe Southern and Weatern members, who insist upou a redlstribution of tbe National Bank cnrrenoy, will agree Instead to a plan of tbe Secretary of tbe Treasury for withdrawing (he three per cents, and issuing nation* al batik notes, while the Eastern States would oppose the redistribution doaired, aa tbe amount would mostly be taken front Massachusetts, Connecticut and lihode Island. It ia believed the Seorotary's plan will meet the wantH of those who demand Increased banking faolllties. JODGR HOAK'fl NO HI NATION, The nomination of Judge Hoar to the Supreme bench will undoubtedly be confirmed before tbe holiday recess. Nobody knowa wbo will be appointed to his place lu the Cabinet. Quite a number of names are mentioned out* eide, but it in mere guess work und speculation of little value. THH OBNBUS BILL Will be Antshed by tbe House to-morrow. It was got out of the Committee of the Whole to day. Only one amendment of any Imporlanco waB carried against tho opposition of tien.

Prominent county oSlceri present remonstrances to partlea calling nn business and Insist on the same being signed before any business can' be transacted. Tns Watt to Sbttlb ii.?We suggest the following plsn for settling at onoe the oonnty seat question, viz: hot an Informal vote be taken In each township, on a day to be agreed upon, and II a majority favor removal, let It be oonslitpred settled, that the Legislature U to pass a law removing the county seal; which law must, of course, take effect on being submitted to a vote snd having a majority, Korthe purpose of taking this vole, let Judges and oltrks be agreed upon lor each township by the contending partlee, and let the vote betaken by ballot and returned to a oommtuee oompoeea or men representing both localities, and If It Is found tbat a majority of tboae voting favor removal, lot II ba nuderaloooU tbat there la to be 110 oppoaltlan to the paahhr? of the law; mid If n majority vote against removal, lit the matter be abandoned.

Mr. Randell said: I am utterly opposed to repudiation. The moment Allowed to me gives me the opportunity tc remonstrate against the enunciation ul any scheme or legislation which I bellevo would place my country in a dishonest attitude before the world, Not only do I believe that we should pay the debt, but I bolleve, whai is of vastly more importance, that the country has the ability, the disposition and the resources to pay it, 1 agree with the gentleman from Obiu that this debt was negotiated at ruinous rales. That in a matter of jaal criticism against the party who then controlled the Government and made the negotiation, but as those who sold bonds upon which is stamped the faith and credit of the country. I say repudiation stands in no other light except the light of dishonesty. Messrs. Wood, of New York, Kerr, Potter, Cox and Woodward expressed similar sentiments during the discussion. The .Republican members gathered around the speakers, evincing Intense interest in tbe proceedings. Mr. Pitch addressed the Committee in favor of the immediate recognition of the Independence of Cuba, aud Mr. Wlllard defended tbe position takeu iu the President's message ou the aubjeoi.
