BURNED OUT BUSINESS MEN were busily engaged to-day ln locating themselves ln new quarters. A. S. Pratt & Sons dug out their safe from the ruins and found the contents uninThey secured an office at 420 9th street. Ir. Adler, whose loss Is said to be very large, estimated ut $20,000. has opened In Seaton halL across the street. Mr. Shedd Is located at 428 9th street. Prof, and Mrs. Spencer have quarters at the Waverly and this morning their business college was going on as usual, only ln more limited quarters. ORIGIN OF THE FIRE. Mr. A. S. Pratt was inclined to think this morning, In talking with a star reporter, that the fire was not due to defective heating apparatus, as that was entirely new. He thought that the fire originated ln the lumber room, beneath the stage and while not positive, he was inclined to think that the building was set on fire. The Insurance men think the fire was due to the theater ln the building. As soon as the theater was started the rate of Insurance was advanced $4 on the thousand on the building and from 7.~> cents to $2 50 on the stock ln the stores. The high rate of insurance caused many of the merchants to carry leas. NOTICE FROM THE BUILDING INSPECTOR. Building Inspector Entwistle lias a letter to A. S. Pratt ? sons, agent for the burned building, stating that the walls are ln danger of being blown over, and-notifying him to have them immediately taken down sufficiently to prevent accident, as at present they are endanatflhtf the life and limbs of the citizen*. He notfllesthem that the owners will be held responsible for anv accident that may occur. IDE

Sergeant Ami mm Made a Police Lientenant To-day, c Now that the rush at the District buildings, In- J cident to getting documents ready for congress is over, the Commissioners have time to consider * police matters, and begun this afternoon to fill r the vacancies brought about by the commission- * ers'action In the Arnold case. The first appoint- * ment made by them was announced at two ? o'clock this afternoon. It w;is that of Sergeant T. li Brooke Amiss to be lieutenant, vice Arnold, dismissed. 4 Acting Sergeant Robey, of the seventh precinct, i was promoted to a full sergeancy, vice Amiss, pro- n moted. s "Will you appoint a new major and superintendent to-day?" asked a Star reporter of Commissioner i Wheatley. 1 "No, I think not," said Mr. Wheatley. J "Can you give a tip as to who will be appointed?" * "No, I cannot," said Mr. Wheatley, "for I do not know myself." The vacancy made by Private Edelln's dismissal t will be filled as usual on the recommendation of c the acting major. The new lieutenant, T. Brooke Amiss, Is one of the best known officers on the I force, and the selection Is generally approved In *' the police department. For several months he ? has been the sergeant In charge of the detective J office at night. 1' The action of the Commissioners In making the ? appointments to-day Is notice that they do not 1 propose to reopen the Arnold case.

J THE WASTE OF WATER. |j Since the cold weather set In the District water J office has been the recipient of a great many complaints of the scarcity of water In various parts of i the city. This arises from the many thoughtless r people all over town who allow the water to flow, f with a view to prevent freezing. "In the name of \ many thousands thus deprived of water," said an i official of the water office to-day, "an appeal is f made to all not to allow the watei*to run to waste. { but if there is danger of their pipes freezing, to ; turn it off In all cases. Tills is much the safer plan. Every householder who allows the Potomac water to run to waste may have the guilty satisfaction that he is depriving tome other persons of their supply and causing great Inconvenience, n Let every resident take a personal interest in stop- ii ping all waste." \

Innnal Report of the Secretary of Ute Treasury* The annual report ot secretary of the Treasury Wanning to Congress, Is mainly devoted to the consideration of the sliver question and currency md taxation reform. In regard to the silver ques-Ion, he says: "The act of 1873, which Me monetized' the standard silver dollar, and he act of 1878, which "remonetlzed" It, ire so nearly Identical that a common authorship night be suspected. The act of 187:1 has been denounced and praised for demonetizing silver, which it did not do. The act of 1878 has been praised and denounced for remonetlzlng sliver, which It did not do. Both took a sure way to fceep our fractional silver at home. Exportations would only be possible at a loss on the stiver coin d under either acs. In both acts monetlzatlon Is denied except to Treasurv purchases. The Secretary reviews at length the action of rnivlgn governments on the silver question, and shows how they were forced Into their present attitude towards silver. the silver qcesti0m. Is an International one, and both our own silver question and surplus problem are involved In It, The f rec-sll ver-colnage prescription for the monetary dislocation satisfies but one of several Indispensable conditions. General free coinage would put us at once on a silver basis, the gold dollar would be at a premium, ana would be exported, and silver would be used exclusively in legal tender payments. And yet even this would not tend to restore the world-wide use 3f silver. The free silver coinage prescription and the silver basis prescription are like amputation >f an uninjured leg to cure temporary lameness in | th*? other. The Secretary Is of the opinion that the time for another conference has not arrived, ind the moment for diplomatic interference is not felicitous. Treasury silver purchase is characterized as "an expense and a taxation demonstrated t?y experience to be of no avaiL" to stop thk pckchase of silver is our only choice, our duty, and our Interest. It will stop a wasteful and injurious expense, and the taxation which defrays It, It will commence md promote reform In the sum and the methods )f federal taxation, It will recover to the Unlt>-d States an equality of position (non-coinage) with 'orelgn powers, which will give us due influence n negotiation. To increase our stock is :o Increase the difficulties of t he Treasury, iliegitmate and abnormal difficulties;" To stop pur- 1 phasing will enable the Treasurv to maintain wit h certainty and greater ease the present stock of i silver coin at par with gold in all our fiscal and iocal uses. "Another year's delay In stopping the silver purchase is the loss of retnunerai ive prices upon ; mother wheat crop of the United States. * It is for congress to consider whether a pollcv I which does not prevent the loss or 25 per cent off ; )f our silver output to a few thousand mine-owners, but prolongs the loss to many million farmers 3f 25 per cent off the price ot their annual wheat tod, should not now be abandoned and the only policy adopted which promises to restore the former prosperity of both." surplus taxation. Employment for the proceeds of our surplus taxation, reasons for delay In reducing our surplus taxation, can no longer be found In a rapid payment of the debt. Setting aside the vanishing three per cents and the unfunded debt of fcHO,J00,000, the residue of the public debt has been in such wise funded by our predecessors ! that $250,000,000 cannot be paid except Py purchase at a high premium to he bondholder, before September l, 1891, and that $7:57, * <0,400 cannot be paid, except bv purchase at a high premium to the bondholder, berore July l, 1907. To continue the present surplus taxation, and to employ Its proceeds In giving to the bondholder premiums by anticipatory purchase 3f those bonds before they are due .and payable at par. Is a fiscal policy unnecessary, extravagant md merciless to the Industrious toilers of our laud. compliance with the provisions or the sinking "und and the public debt will jeffect the payment )t the whole public debt, greenbacks and bonds, ay the year 1908 without a continuance or our present surplus taxation. He recommends the repeal or the clause In the act ot February 28,1878, naklng compulsory Treasury purchases of silver, in order to reduce surplus and mnecessary taxation $24,000,000 a year. I. Further reduction of surplus taxation close lown to the necessities of the government ecolomlcally administered. 3.

"What surplus we expend in paying off the greenback debt will diminish by so much the immediate reduction of our tariff taxation; for, wliile the funded debt stands, certainly it is not wise to discard the taxes on whisky, tobacco and t)eer. Indeed, it is my own belief that whenever we begin taking off the shackles if war-tariff taxes on raw materials, we shall see our Income from Imported manufactures dwindle so fast as not only to compel t he reentlon of these most fit items of revenue?whisky, .obacco and beer?but, perhaps, to drive us back X) getting ten millions of revenue from two cents l pound tax on coffee and half as much from tea. protection and free trade.

Fire was discovered In the upper * ston- at 9 o'clock last, night, and Mr. Evans started ? an alarm which brought together a number of J neighbors, who extinguished the flames with little 1 trouble and small loss, but early this morning the ? flames broke out again, and before help could ar- < rive the building was burned to ashes. The house was a new one sit uated In a largo open field nearly ? half a mile from any neighbors, and had been occu- ? Died but two months. Valuable assistance was ren- J dered the distressed family by Mr. F. A. Holden, ? who with Ids boys went and fought the Ore on ? both occasions, and whose house is now affording ? shelter to Mr. Evans and family. The loss will be c particularly hard on Mr. Evans, as the place was but partlv paid for. The dwelling was partly in- ? sured. Mr. Evans is the president of the board of comndssioners of Hyattsvllle.

Few questlons liave arisen during the past year with other governments, and none of those an'beyond the reach of set t lenient In friendly counsel. We are a.4-, yet without provision for the settle. m< nt of claims of citizens of the Untied states against Chile for Injuries during the late war with Peru and Bolivia. The ml x?*d commissions, organ* Iwd under claims conventions, istnduded by the Chilean government wit b certain Riimpem states, have developed au amount of friction which we trust can be avoided In t he convention which our representative at Santiago is authorized to negotiate. OFTSAGES ON CHINKS*. The cruel treatment of inoffensive Chinese has, I regret to shj", been repeated in some of the far western states and territories, and acts of violence against those people, beyond the power of the local constituted authorities to prevent, and difficult to punish, are reported even In distant Alaska. Much of this violence c?n l>e traced to race prejudice and competition of labor, which cannot, however. Justify tne oppr>*ss|on of straugers whose safety is guaranteed bv our treaty with China equally with the most favored nations. In opening our vast domain to alien elements, the purpose of our lawgivers was to Invite assimilation. and not to provide an arena for endless antagonisms. The paramount duty of maintaining public order ana defending the Interests of our own people may require the adoption of ineastm-s of restriction, but they should not tolerate the oppression of Individuals of a special race. I am not without assurance that the government of _ china, whose friendly dls|MMilon towards us 1 aiu most happy to recognize, will meet us half way in devising a comprehensive remedy, by which au effective limitation of Chinese emigration, jolm-d to protection of those Chinese subjects who r?v main In this country, may be secured. Legislation Is needed to execute the provisions of our Chinese convention of 1880 touching the opium traffic. While the pood will of the Colombian government toward our country Is manifest, the situation of American interests on the isthmus of Panama has at times excited concern, and Invited friendly action looking to the performan<v of the engagements of the two nations concerning the territory embraced In the lntemoeaalc transit. With the sul*4genceofthe Isthmian dlsturhanoes, and the erection of the State of Panama into a federal district under the direct government oi the constitutional administration at Bogota, a new order of thing"* has been Inaugurated which, although as yet somewhat expert mental and affording scope for arbitrary eierelH? of power by ths delegates of the national authority, promises much Improvement. The sympathy between the people of the United States and France, born during our colonial struggle for Independence and continuing to-day, has received a fresh impulse in the successful completion and dedication of the colossal statue of "Lib* erty Enlightening the World" in New York harbor?the fHft of Frenchmen to Americans. A convention between the 1'nlted Slates and certain other powers for the protein Ion of submarine cables was signed at Parts on March 1^ 1884. and has been duly ratified and proclaims) by t his government. By agreement between the high contracting parties this convention Istogc into effect on the 1st of January next, but th< legislation required for its execution In the rnlted States has not yet been adopted. I earnestly recommend its enact menu Ca.s??s havecontlnuedtooccurln Germany giving rise to much correspondence In relation to the privilege of sojourn of our naturalized citizens of lierman orlglu revisiting the laud of their birth, vet I am happy to state that our relations with that country have lost none of their accustomed cordiality. The claims for Interest upon the amount of tonnage dues illegally exacted from certain German steamship lines were favorably reported In both Houses of Congress at the last session, and I trust ?lll receive liual and favorable action at an early lay. THE USHERV QrESTION. The recommendations contained in my last innual message in relation to a mode of settlenent of the fishery rights In the waters of British V'ortli America?so long a subject of anxious dlference between the United states and Great Britain?was met by an adverse vote of the Senate m April 13th la-st, and thereupon negotiations vere lnstltuttd to obtain an agreement with Her irltannic Majesty's government for the promulgation of such Joint interpretation and definition ?f the article of the convention of 1818, relating o the territorial waters and Inshore fisheries <?f he British pr vines, as should secure the Tamilian rights from encroachment by 1'nlted states Isl.ermen, and, at the same time, ensure th- enoyment by the latter of the privileges guaranteed jo them by such convention. The questions Involved are of long standing, of rrave consequence, and from time to time for learly three-quarters of a century have given 1se to earnest International discussions, not unaccompanied by irritation. Temporary arrangements by treaties have served to allav friction?which, however, has rived as ea<h treaty was terminated. The last ar'angeuiettt, under the treaty of 1871, was abro. fated after due notice by the United States on lune :W, 1885, but I was enabled to obtain for our lshernien for the remainder or i hat season, enjoynent of the full privileges accorded by the termlaated treaty. The Joint High Commission by whom the treaty lad been negotiated?although Invested with denary pow er to make a permanent settlement? vere content with a temporary arrangement,after he termination of which the question was rel?. rated to the stipulations of the treaty of 1818, as 0 the first article of wldcb no const ruction sail*. a dory to both countries has ever been agreed tpon. The progress of civilization and growth of popuatlon In rhe British Provinces to which the hsheies in question are contiguous, and tbe expansion if commercial Intercourse bet ween them and the nlted states, present to-day a condition of affairs carcely realizable at tbe date of the negotiations if 1818. New and vast Interests have been brought Into xlstenee; modes of Intercourse between the r^ neutlve countries have been invented and multiilied; the methods of conducting the fisheries bars ?een wholly changed; and all this is necessarily ntltled to candid and careful consideration in ths djustment of the terfns and conditions of Intercourse and commerce between the I'nlted states nd their nelgnbors along a frontier of over 3J>00 nlles. This propinquity, communitv of language and ccupatlon, ana similarity of political and social Dstltutlons, Indicate the practicability and obvlus wl sdom of maintaining mutually beneficial rlendly relations.* Whilst 1 am unfeigned I y desirous that such rela? Ions should exist between us and the inhabitants f Canada, yet tbe action of their officials during he past season towards our fishermen has beeo uch as to seriously threaten their continuance. Although disappointed in my efforts to secure s at lsfactor)' settlement of tbe fishery question. legotlatians are sUll pending, with reasonable tope that before tbe close of the present sessiona( ongress announcement may be u>?t an ao ept able conclusion has been reached.
