District affair* are not neglected in the Prsa dent * message. Attention is called to the urgent need of a revision or codification of District law*. After commending to careful consider ation proposed legislation concerning the liquor traffic. the proper assessment and col lection of taxes. Ac., the President *???: "I again call attention to the preeent incon venience and the daoger to life and property attending the operation of steam railroads through apd across the pablic street* and roads of the District. Tne propriety of rach legisla tion as will properly guard the use of these railroads and better secure the convenience and safety of <*itizsns is manifest." The Dis trict s'-cerely hopee that the propriety and neceaaity of this corrective legislation, so mani fest to a President who uses his eye*, will also be clearly aeen by Congress. The legislative body might also be encouraged to provide ad ditional legislation concerning the railroads, by a more vigilant enforoement of existing law* by the Commissioner* and the United States district attorney. The President also refer* to the neglect to provide for the erection of a po*t-offlc* build ing at the national capital, the propriety and neceaaity of which are not disputed, while ?core* of public buildings have been erected where their necessity for public purpose* is not apparent That shot hits the center of the target. There are no resident voter* here to cause the erection of this building to become a matter of personal or partisan interest to a single member of the national legislature. K broad, public-spirited, statesmanlike view of proposed legislation is required to raise advo cates for such measures. Consequently the necessary legislation is lacking, and the post office of the national capital continues to occupy unhealthfnl. tumble-down, rented quarters. A truly royal way is that is which King Milan, of Servia. goes about the task of getting rid of a queen who no longer amuses him; and in truly a woman'* way doea she contest his movement, step by step, refusing to recognise the authority by which he thrusts her aside. Bis latest stroke is to publish her as henceforth plain Mme. Natalie de Keczko.and make a de posit in the bank for her benefit, after the fashion of a grand seigneur pensioning off a companion who has wearied hln. but whom, for association's sake, he is unwilling to caat adrift utterly. It may not be so easy to dis pose of a woman of Natalie's tenacity. It is a queen she means to be. not a private female subject of the king with two hundred thousand dollars to live on. It is possible that the only way he can end the troublesome business will be to trump up a charge of high treason, or something of thut sort, and chop off her head. That may be a distressing necessity, but king* have been driven to it before. The Bfconl asks. "Why not eat corn?" Be cause. esteemed contemporary, in this land of protection wages are high ehoOMi for every body to have iour.?PhUadrlphdP Prtu. Just so; but wouldn't a good many people be as well or better off if they should use more corn than they do, and apply the difference be tween the cost of wheat flour and corn meal to the procurement of other comforts of life, or -ay it by for a rainy day? Wheat flour i* cer tainly a very good thing, but it isn't an abso lute necessity to anybody. Why are not the White Caps of Ohio bronght to justice and punished? That is the question with which a large part of the northern press would ring if the scene of the outrages were transferred to the other side of the Ohio river, und the victims were black instead of white. Gov. Foraker has now an excellent opportunity of exemplifying some of the principles which he has often urged upon the chief magistrates of Southern states, and cleansing his splendid commonwealth of the stain which such lawless proceedings alway* fasten upon the communi ty where they occur. And if Mr. Foraker will not move in the matter, what is to prevent Mr. Chandler from offering a resolution in the Sen ate for the appointment of a committee with full powers to investigate and report? President Cleveland will do well to go slow in the matter of criticising the occupancy of the streets and reservation* of Washington by steam railroad tracks, or he may find the "usual courtesies" of the Pennsylvania syitem with drawn for the remainder of hi* term. These big corporations are not in the habit of per mitting free di*cus*ion of matter* affecting their relation* with the public. If the police are really '-shadowing'' Dr Tumblety in New York, they are taking a very certain way of letting him know it by publish ing the fact in the newspapers. Evidently the President still view* civfl serv ice reform as an accomplished fact, concerning which no farther discussion on hi* part is nec eesary. His failure to consider this subject in the previous message, and to make pledges in respect to it in his letter accepting the second presidential nomination, were explained on the theory that no more words were required. He ?eems to adhere to that theory. Thi* absti nence is specially remarkable, since political history teaches very clearly that elaborate dis cussion of civil service reform with profuse as surances in respect to it is characteristic of an outgoing administration, as well as of candi date* in the doubtfnl state before election, and that extreme reticence on the subject is to be expected only from the luccessful party and candid.te. who are soon to be called upon to keep their promise*. Some complaint i* heard that the President'* message is too long. But it must not be for gotten that he had a two year*' review of the state of the nation to write. In 1887 he had nothing to *ay on any subject except the tariff. Waahington'* new morning newspaper, the Prt*?. issued by the Messrs. Fox, is well printed and newsy in appearance. It declare* itself devoted to republican principle* and policies, including protection to home Industrie*, and to th* elective franchise in every part of the re public. If the Canadian question is settled in favor of annexation, where will the political boodlers and defaulting bank-cashiers and delinquent trustees skip to? It is safe to say on which aid* the vote of that element mar be counted, if the matter ever has to be decided by the popular voice north of the border. It is unwise on the part of the friends of vs rious statesmen who aspire to places in the next Cabinet to suggest that this one or that would, by ssch elevation, be enabled to get into train ing for the Presidential race of 1892. It would be more than human to expect Gen. Harrison wittingly to invite men of eminence to occupy chairs in his council chambeV, whence they covld make preparations for the defeat of any aatiition he may have now, or acquire later, to socc*ed himself.
