V- Vol. 31 V President William H.Taft's Message to Congress IS A VERY TAME DOCUMENT. HE SIDE STEPS MANY .VITAL OR IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. WHICH ARE OF GREAT INTEREST TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT WILL NOT COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH SIMILAR STATE PAPERS. WHICH HAVE BEEN PROMULGATED BY MANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS. On last Monday, both houses of con gress convened for the short or the holiday session and on the following day President "William H. Taf fs mes to congress was read and to say the least, it is a very tame document and he side eteps many vital or important questions, which are of great interest to the American people: The president, in what might be called his maiden message touches upon the Canadian Boundary Treaty, the international conference at Brus sels, he praises Turkey's progress, the improvements in Cuba. In speaking of the unrest" in" Central America, the president sets forth his views as fol folwB: 31nce the "Washington conventions of 1907," he says, "were communicated to the government of the United States as a consulting and advising party, this government has been al most continuously called upon by one or another, and in turn by all of the five Central American republics, to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions. Nearly every com plaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America in constant ten sion or tunnon." "I need not rehearse here the pa tient efforts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these republics, efforts which are fully appreciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true interests. It would be no less unnecessary to rehearse here the sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya government. "Recently two Americans were put to death by order of President Zelaya himself. They were officers in the organized forces of a revolution which had continued many weeks and was in control of about half of the repub lic, and as such, according to the modern enlightened practice of clvill zed nations, they were entitled to be dealth with as prisoners of war. . "At the date when this message Is printed this government has termin ated diplomatic relations with the Ze laya government, for reasons made public In a communication to the for 

8HERIFF OAVIS OF ALEXANDER COUNTY, ILLINOIS REMOVED FROM. OFFICE IN DIS GRACE. It is gratifying to state, that Gover nor Charles S. Deneen comes up with! the right thing, when, he put one over on Sheriff Davis of Alexander County, UL, and removed Mm from office in disgrace, for falling to bravely and manfully protect the lives of the two prisoners whom he permitted to be mobbed and lynched a short time ago, by the eminently respectable Christian; ladles and gentlemen of Cairo. The badge of shame fastened upon Sheriff Davis, for yielding to.race pre judice sad practically Joinng hands with the mob in Its Moody work of murdering -msa. who had sot been tried sad convicted of conmlttfBg any crime, should he & wholesome warn Jag to other sieriJEs of 4Us state sad peace acers that they mast Botehlrki their datyaad that they aast always" BUETW TO TELES mer Nlcaraguan charge d'affaires, and is intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American In terests, and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may be necessary for me to bring this subject to the attention of the congress in a special message." He successfully plows around the great scandal In connection with buy ing and constructing the Panama Ca nal; he also dislikes to touch upon the many glaring frauds which have been committed by some of the cus tom house officers at New York City, for the benefit of the American Sugar Refining Company, and others who gave up some of their money to as sist to elect him president of the United States. The president, like president like President Roosevelt, is a etrong advo cate of speedy Justice, which Is noth ing more nor less than mob and lynch law, and ht also favors curtail ing the powers of the courts; he is also in favor of compelling congress men who are candidates for re-election and their managers, to file a statement with a proper officer of the United States government as to the amount of money they receive and expend In their campaigns and where the money comes from, but the president Is very careful not to ask congress to pass a law to punish by imprisonment all the head captians of industry and the bosses of the gigantic trusts and mon opolies, who chucked hundreds of thousands of dollars into his campaign fund in 1908, and for some cause or other the president Is silent on this point. The president favors a commission of not more than seven persons to consider the feasibility of an exposi tion to show the progress of the Ne gro since his emancipation. The other subjects or questions touched upon by the president are very shallow not weighty by any means and they will excite but little Interest in the hearts of his countrymen. On the whole his mesage does not compare favorably with similar state papers, which have been promulgated by many of his Illustrious predeces sors. shoot to kill, regardless of whom the bullets hit and hill, in order to pre serve law and order.

Elijah J. Fisher, in the Apellate Court. Mr. Justice Smith in rendering the opinion in the above cause in the Appellate Court recently found as follows: "After a careful consideration of the evi dence we think that the plaintiff in error E. J. Fisher is justly indebted to William Bruner in the sum of $108 the 'judgment j)f the lower court is therefore reversed and the cause re manded unless the defendant in error, William Bruner shall remit in ten days down to $io8jOO in which case a judgment win be affirmed for this amount" It seems that Mr. Bnmers attorneys con cluded that they would be able to show another jury that Mr. Fisher even owed more than Judge Smith had allowed and they permitted the case to be reversed.
