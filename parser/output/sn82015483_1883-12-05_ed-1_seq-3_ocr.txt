The haokneyed phrases of "selling at ooat," "the manufacturer's price for everything," and many other obsolete devioes and cheap clothing tricks are no longer tolerated by firms who are keen enough to drop them -Several years ago, when this country was in a oondition bordering on poverty, so to speak, the catchy announcements were read and be lieved by nine-tenths of the people, when in reality the statements contained about twen ty per cent, of troth and eighty per cent, of exaggeration. At the present time we are glad to say that only one tenth of the people are led to believe that the so-called great re dactions of thirty to forty per cent, are gen- nine. Like charity, we will admit that dealers who indulge in this style of advertising have made truthful statements. Their customers who bought eoods previous to the time of reduotion mnat have paid thirty to forty per cent, profit, and perhaps a little more, not deducted, to help pay a large rent or incident al expenses. It most be borne in mind that expenses govern prices, especially in this city, where competition is quite strong, and the volnme of trade limited to its own precincts, including a few ooontry towns. Therefore we believe that all thinking people will read ily perceive that Oak Hall is a olothing store of the happy medium order, and the manage ment ifl proud in being able to truthfully an nounce that the business np to the present time has been exceptionally fine, which is partially dne to the fact, that expenses gov era, prices, and both are low in OA.I 85 Church Street, NEW

While no action was taken on this resolution the general im pression is that no change in the Senate as now organized will be made other than to elect a secretary to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Burch.

What Shall tne Harvest be. Washington, Deo. 4. Two hundred and twenty-seven bills were presented in the Senate to-day. A System of Postal Telegraphy. Washington, Deo. 4. Mr. Edmunds intro duced a bill in the Senate to-day to provide for building and establishing under the di rection of the Postmaster General, the Sec retary of State and Secretary of War postal telegraph lines throughout the country. The Secretary of War is authorized to condemn property for right of way. Clerks and telegraphers are to be appointed through the civil service commissioners. Two million dollars are appropriated for the work daring the next fiscal year. Private individuals or corporations are not to be interfered with in carrying on their telegraph business. In A( jieailvt Warfare Against Polyga my. Washington, Dec. 4. Senator Lapham, of Ksw York, proposes to introduce a bill at an early opportunity to abolish the territo rial government in Utah and to appoint a commission of five persons to administer the affairs of the territory. A very aggressive movement against polygamy will be begun. Another Move for Porter's Relief. Washington, Dec 4. Mr. Slocum, of New York, presented in the House to-day a long memorial of the Fifth Army Corps associa tion in favor of a bill for the relief of Gen eral Fitz John Porter and . the letter of Gen eral Grant of November 3, i8s, giving his reasons for his change of mind regarding the Porter case. The memorial embraces a rec ord of the action of the association at its meetings at Harriaburg in 1874 and at Wash ington in 1883. In the White House Again. Washington, Dec. 4. The President has moved into the executive mansion for the winter from his summer residence at the Soldiers' Home. His sister, Mrs. McGlroy, and other relatives will probably spend the Christmas holidays with the President. Forty-Eighth Contress First Session. Washington, Dec. 4. Senate After the journal had been read the chair laid before the Senate the report of the clerk of the court of claims, memorials from tbe legislative council of Montana on the subject of theYollowstonePark and of tbe New York chamber of commerce in memory of the late Governor Morgan of New York. Mr. Cooke presented a memorial of the United States attorney of Texas on the sub ject ef the administration of justice in that district. He asked that the memorial be printed in the Record. Mr. Ingalls called attention to the large amount of matter print ad in the Record, which was designed to be a suocinot statement of the debates of Con gress. He looked upon the introduction of other matter as a vioious praotice and thought it was time to call a halt. He therefore ob jected to the memorial being printed in the Record. To overcome this objection the memorial was read. Mr. Miller, of New - York, presented the petition of the chamber of commerce and several maritime, associations of New York asking for the construction of a marine hos pital in that city. The following bills among many others were introduced: By Mr. Ingalls to amend the arrears of pensions act by removing the limitations named in the act. By Mr. Beck to remove all disabilities imposed by the four teenth amendment of the constitution; to authorize the payment of customs duty in le gal tender. By Mr. Hoar to provide for the performance of the duties of the executive in case of the death or disability of the Pres ident; in relation to tbe eleotoral vote; to provide a national bankruptcy law. By Mr. Williams to prevent the spread of infectious and contagious diseases among oattle. By Mr. Piatt to establish sohoola ia Alaska. By Mr. Sherman authorising national banks to issue bills to 90 per e.nt. of the market val ue of the bonds deposited to secure circula tion. Mr. Garland introduced a bill to amend the section of the revised statutes in refer ence to the election ot Senators in Congress. He stated that of the twenty-six Senators sworn in yesterday there were thirteen who would not stand the test of the act of July 2S, 186S, if objection had been raised. He thought it time something should be dons to remove this difficulty and thought it was as well to proceed to amend the act while there was no political excitement in the Senate ; referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections when appointed. Mr. Edmnnds introduced a bill to amend sections 1,756 and 1,757 of the revised stat utes. He said this bill wag covered by one of the bills introduced by the Senator from Kentucky (Beck,) but it contained what that gentleman's bill had not hitherto contained the security of the United States treasury re garding the claims which might be msde against it and the penalties which might be imposed for false swearing. He was quite willing to substitute for what is called the oath provided by seotion 1,757 for those Sen ators who could not properly take the ironclad oath. Mr. Edmunds also intro? duoed bill for the further protection of oitisens of the United States against the violation of certain rights secured to them by the constitution. This bill wishes to pro tect colored persons against the prejudicial distinction still made against them in cer tain States and to protect them consistently with tbe lata decision of the Supreme court. He also introduced a bill to protect the con stitutional right of citizens and to secure them he said a free ballot and a free count. Mr. Edmnnds introduced a bill to provide for the establishment of a postal telegraph system. The Senate took a recess until 2:30 o'clock and at that hoar the recess was extended un til 8 o'clock. At three o'olock the President's message was read. The reports of the Sec retary of the Treasury, Attorney General and other heads of departments' were laid on the table. Mr. Jjogan obtained leave to introduce a bill to devote $50,000,000 derived from the internal revenue taxation and the sale of pub lic lands to the education of children in tbe Unfted States. V The Senate adjourned at 4:05. , Houss. No chaplain having been elected the House was opened a second day without prayer. After ths reading of the journal Mr. ?-i . ... rt.i : -v.? . to refer the question of the primm fade ri jht j of Mr. Manning to the seat for the Second Mississippi diutriot to the Committee on Elee- tions with instructions to report immediately without prejudice to the final rights to .said : IS "' " - ' " ? At the suggestion of Mr. Keifer, of Ohio, the motion, was amended so as to Include Mr. Chalmers and adopted without dissent. The delegates from the territories were then sworn in.

At the conclusion of the drawing, on motion of Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, the House at 2:10 p. m. took a recess for thirty minutes to await the Presi dent's, message. At 3 o'clock the committee to wait on the Presi dent - reported that duty . performed, and Mr, Pruden, private secretary to the President, appeared with the message. Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, had moved a ref erence of the papers in the contested election case from the First Virginia distriot to the Elections committee for a decision of prima facie rights to the seat and demanded the previous question, tie onargea iraua in tne returning board. Mr. Calkins, of Indiana, submitted as a parliamentary point that the prima fade question had been settled by the swearing in of the member. Mr. Keifer, of Ohio, contended that such action was without precedent and could be used to unseat a member and debar him from the right of contest. Mr. Springer insisted that though circum stances made it necessary to leave prelimi nary questions to others, the House when or ganized had foil power and it became its duty to inquire into this and all other ques tions. Mr. J. S. Wise, of Virginia, said the state ments of Mr. Springer were not borne out by the record. The only returning board frauds from Virginia were in the oase of Goods vs. Piatt. In that oase Piatt was elected, but a Democratic House gave the seat to Goods. Mr. Mayo, the contestant, asserted the va lidity of his election and asked tbe House not to pronounce against him without a hearing: Mr. Tucker, at the request of Mr. Randall, allowed the subject to go over until to-morrow in order that the President's message might be read. The message having been read Mr. Morri son, of Illinois, moved the usual resolution referring the message to the Committee of the Whole and that it be printed, whioh was adopted, and the House at 4:50 p. m. ad journed.
