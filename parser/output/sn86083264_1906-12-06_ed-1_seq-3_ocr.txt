PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE I'rgt-s Same Justice in Black and White Races—Educate All Class es —Against Corporation Cam paign Funds —Preachers of Dis content Scored. ' Washingtan, I). C . l>ec. 4 President Roosevelt in his annual message again urges the enactment of n law prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign funds. He : Iso urges ihe passage of the measure i >nferring upon the government the right of appeal in criminal cases on • |iiestion< of law. Continuing, the president says: I cannot too strongly urge the pas age of the bill in question. A failure to pass it will result in seriously ham pering tlie government in its effort to • htain justice, especially against wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong, aud may also prevent 'he government from obtaining justice for eworkers who are not thetn elves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of au inferior •out has been against them. I have spe< ilic: lly in view a recent declelon by a district Judge leaving railway employees without remedy for viola tion of a certain so called labor statute. The i ;nportauce of enacting into law the particular bill iu question Is fur ther increased by the fact that the gov eriMi'ent has now definitely begun a pol •> of resorting to the criminal law iu tl ose trust and Interstate commerce case where such a course offers a rea sonal le chance of success. Proper Ise of injunctions. In my lust message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunctions, attention having beeu sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of ap plying injunctions lu labor cases should be wholly abolished. It la at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of Injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts, in which case, of course, the legislation would be Ineffective. More over, I believe It would be wrong alto gether to prohibit the use of Injunc tions. It is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hacdi iu upholdiug the law, and If men seek to destroy life or property by ir.ob violence there should be no Im pairment of the power of the courts to deal with them lti the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated lust year Affalnst Lynching. 1 call your attention and the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us and, above all, to the epidemic of lynching aud mob violence | that springs up now in one part of our j country, now in another. Each sec tion, north, south, eust or west, has | ""Its ovn faults. No'section can with ; wisdom spend its time jeering at the faults of another section. It should be busy trying to amend its own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption it is necessary to have an awakened public conscience and to supplement this by whatever legisla tion will add speed aud certainty In the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more is neces sary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime is peculiarly frequent In respect to black men. The greatest existiug cause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black 1 men, of the hideous crime of rape, the most abominable in all the category ' of crimes, even worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon. und when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lynchings are not for rape at all, while a considerable proportion of the individuals lynched are innocent of all crime. There is but one safe rule In dealing with black men as with white men. It is the same rule that must be ap plied lu deuliug with rich meu aud poor men—that is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed or his so cial position, with even handed Justice on his real worth as a man. White people owe ii quite us much to them selves us to the colored race to treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves such treatment. There Is no question of social equality or negro domination involved. In my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as is the case with murder. Assault with intent to commit rape should be | made a capital crime, ut least in the discretion of the court, and provision should be made by which the punish ment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense. No more shortsighted policy can be Imagined than In the fancied Interest of one class to prevent the education of another class. The white man, if he is wise, will decline to allow the negroes in a mass to grow to man hood and womanhood without educa tion. "Preachers of Mere Discontent." In dealing with both labor aud cap ital, with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there Is one matter more Important to re member than aught else, and that Is the Infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite a violent class ha tred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ment® for the better control of corpora tions and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth Into a campaign or nysiericai excuemeui auu falsehood iu which the aim Is to in flame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogues and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to as sociate themselves with those worklDg for a genuine reform in governmental end social methods and sometimes mas ouerade as such reformers. Iu reality they nr» the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors of sensational slander In newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies of all meu who are engaged in au honest effort to better what Is W In our social and governmental condi tions. Corruption is never so rife as In com munities where the demagogue aud the ; 'itator bear full sway, because in Mich communities all moral bands be come I >osened, and hysteria and seusa l m.il : i replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between j man an I man. lu sheer revolt against j flie squalid anarchy thus produced men are su;v in the end to turn toward any n der v ho can restore order, and then 'r relief at being free from the In -'c burdens of class hatred, Ylo ience ami deuiagogv is such that tuey cannot for some time 1 >«» aroused to in dignation against misdeeds by men of wealth, so that they permit a new growth of the very which wore lu p-irt responsible for the original out lne.iU The one hope for success for our people lies in a resolute aud fear less but sane and cool headed advance alonn the path marked out last year by this very congress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled Into fol lowing either that ba«e creature who appeals ami panders to the lowest lu stiucis end passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or that other creature, equally base, hut no baser, who in a spirit of greed or to accumulate or add to an already huge fortune seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous dis regard to their welfare of aoul and body. The man who debauches others In order to obtain a high office stands 011 an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit, and when hatred is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. The plain people who think—the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors—owe it to them selves to remember that the most dam aging blow that can be given popular government is to elect au unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Kullroail Employees' Honrs. I call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. The measure is a very moder ate one, and I can conceive of no seri ous objection to it. Indeed, so far as it is in our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general In troduction of an eight hour day. There are industries in which it Is not pos sible that the hours of labor should be reduced. Just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, if in the tropics, so situated that there is no analogy between their needs and ours In this matter. On the isthmus of Panama, for instance, the condi tions are in every way so different from what they are here that an eight hour day would be absurd, just as it is absurd, so far as the isthmus is con cerned. where white labor canuot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. Rut the wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely industrial .standpoint and front the civic standpoint it should be our object to do what we can in the direc tion of securing the general observance of an eight hour day. Let me again urge that the congress provide for a thorough investigation of the conditions of child labor and of the labor of women In the United States. The horrors incident to the employment of young children In fac tories or at work anywhere are a blot on our civilization. In spite of all precautions exercised by employer* there are unavoidable ac cidents and even deaths involved in nearly every line of business connect- | ed with the mechanic arts. It is a great social injustice to compel the em- j ployee, or. rather, the family of the killed or disabled victim, to bear the entire burden of such an inevitable sacrifice. In other words, society shirks its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas the injury comes from what may l>e called the legitl- j mate risks of the trade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due in auy line of Industry to the actual conditions un der which that industry is carried on should be paid by that portion of the community for the benefit of which the industry is carried on—that is. by those who profit by the Industry. If the entire trade risk is placed upon the employer, he will promptly and prop erly add it to the legitimate cost of pro duction and assess it proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity It is therefore clear to my mina tnat the law should place this entire "risk of a trade" upon the employer. Capital and labor Disputes. Records show that during the twen ty years from Jan. 1, 18*1, to Dee. 31, 1900, there were strikes affecting 117,- 509 establishments, and (i,100,»i94 em- | ployees were thrown out of employ ment. During the same period there were 1.005 lockouts, involving nearly 10,000 establishments, throwing over 1,000,00u people out of employment. These strikes and lockouts involved au estimated loss to employees of $307,- 000.000 and to employers of $143,000,- 000, a total of $150,000,000. The public suffered directly and indirectly prob ably as great additional loss. Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had the par ties to the dispute been required t<i appear before an unprejudiced bod} representing the nation and, face t« face, state the reasons for their con tentlon. The exercise of a Judicial spirit by a disinterested body repre senting the fecjral government, such as would be provided by a commission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to crei'te an atmosphere of friend liness and conciliation between con tending parties. Control ol lurpuratloii*. It caunot too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shown the j Impossibility of securing by the actions j of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not oper ate exclusively within the limits of uny one state. In some method, wheth er by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, n far more complete control than at present over these great corporations—a coutrol that will, among other things, prevent the evils of ex cessive overcapitalization and that will compel the disclosure by each big cor poration of its stockholders and of its ! pr ipertlea mid business, whether own ed directly or through subsidiary or a filiated corporations. This will tend to put n stop to the securing of Inor dinate profits by favored individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders or the wage workers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to see that It results in no harm to the people. Combination of capital, like combina tion of labor. Is a necessary element of our present industrial system. It Is not possible completely to prevent It, aud if it were possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic. What we need Is not vainly to try to prevent all combina tion. but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their injuring the public or existing In such form as Inevitably to threaten Injury, for the mere fact that a combination has secured practically complete con trol of a necessary of life would undvt Ouj circumstances snow such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to the public interest. It Is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid all combinations instead of sharply discriminating between those combinations which do good and those combinations which do evil. Re bates, for instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers (as was shown In the investigation of the Standard Oil company and as has been shown since by the investigation of the tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the initiative of big railroads. Often rail roads would like to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and of the general public. Such a combina tion, Instead of being forbidden by law, should be favored. In other words, it should be permitted to railroads to make agreements, provided these agree ments were sanctioned by the Inter state commerce commission and were published With these two conditions complied with it is impossible to see what harm such a combination could do to the public at large. Inheritance and Income Tax. The national government has long derived its < hief revenue from a tariff ou imports and from au internal.or ex cise ta\. In addition to these, there is every reason why, when next our sys tem of taxation is revised, the national gorernmc if sh ntld impose a graduated inhc it i! c tax and. if possible, a grad uated income tax. I mii v..-II aware that such a subject i i iii needs 1 >ng and careful study in orde;* that the people may become fa miliar with what is proposed to be done, iii y clcar'y see the necessity of l-rocec lug with wisdom and self re .-ira'nt aud may make up their minds ju. t how fur they are willing togo in tite matter, while only trained legisla tors can work out the project lu neces sary detail Rut I feel that lu the near future our national legislators should enact a law providing for a graduated inheritance 112 :x by which a steadily in creasing rale of duty should be put upon ad iii j.seys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest or devise to any indivi lual or corporation. There cau be no question of the ethical pro priety of the government thus deter mining the conditions itpou which nu.v gift or inheritance should be received. As the law now stands it Is undoubt edly difficult to devise a national in come tax which shall be constitutional. Rut whether it is absolutely impossible is another question, and if possible it is most certainly desirable. The first purely income tax law was passed by the congress In 1801, but the most im portant law dealing with the subject was that of 1594. This the court held to be unconstitutional. The question is undoubtedly very in tricate. delicate and troublesome. The decision of the court was only reached oy one majority, it is me urw oi mc land and of course 's accepted as such and loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Nevertheless the hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when considered to gether with previous decisions on the subject, may perhaps indicate the pos sibility of devising a constitutional in come tax law which shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. The difficulty of amending the constitution is so great that only real necessity can justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made in dealing with this subject, as with the subject of the proper control by the national govern ment over the use of corporate wealth in interstate business, to devise legis lation which without such action shall attain the desired end. but if this fails there will ultimately be no alternative to a constitutional amendment. Industrial Training. Our Industrial development depends largely npou technical education. In cluding in this term all industrial edu cation, from that which fits a man to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter or blacksmith to rhat which fits a man to do the greatest engineering feat The skilled mechanic, the skilled work man, can best become such by tech nical industrial education. The far teaching usefulness of Institutes of technology aud schools of mines or of engineering Is now universally ac knowledged, and no less far reaching Is the effect of a good building or me chanical trades school, a textile or watchmaking or engraving school. In every possible way we should help the wage worker who tolls with his hands and who must (we hope In a constantly increasing measure) also toil with bis brain. Under the ooustitu tlon the national legislature can do but little of direct importance for his wel fare save where he is engaged in work which permits it to act under the In terstate commerce clause of the consti tution, and this is one reasou why I so earnestly hope that both the legis lative and judicial branches of the gov ernment will construe this clause of the constitution in the broadest possi ble manner. The Farmer. The only other persons whose wel fare is as vital to the welfare of the whole country as Is the welfare of the wageworkers nre the tillers of the soil, the farmers. Several factors must co-operate in the improvement of the farmer's con dition. He must have the chance to be educated In the widest possible sense, in the sense which keeps ever in view the Intimate relationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. Organize t m has become necessary in the business world, aud It has ac complished much for good in the world of labor. It Is no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement Is good in itself and is capable of a well nigh Infinite fur ther extension for good so long as It Is kept to Its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the as sociation of farmers for mutual ad vantage are partly economic and part ly sociological. IrrlKHtlou HII* Korent I'renervation. Much is now beinjt done for the states of the Rocky mountains and great plains through the development of the national policy of irrigation and forest preservation No government policy for the betterment of our inter nal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. Divorce Legislation. I am well aware of how difficult it Is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless, in my judgment, the whole i|uestion of inarriaire and di vorce should be relegated to the au thority of the national congress. The change would be »od from every standpoint. In particular it would be good because it vould confer ou the congress the pow« r at once to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy, aud I his should be done whether or not marriage anil divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper to leave the question of polygamy to be dealt with by the several stale*. Merchant Uni-tiie. Let me once aga i<i cull the attention of the cougress tj two subiacts con- I cerulng which 1 have frequently We ' fore communicated with them. One Is the question of developing American shipping. I trust that a law embody ing In substance the views or a major part of the views expressed In ttie re port on this subject laid before the house at its last session will be passed. It seems to me that the proposed meas ure is as nearly unobjectionable as any can be. The Currency. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aid lng the enormous business develop ment of the country, and witiiin ten years there has been an Increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has i been accumulating that additional leg islation is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the de fects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to in cur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary of the treasury had to step ! In and by wise action put a stop to the j most violent period of oscillation. I do not press any especial plan. Va rious plans have recently been pro posed by expert committees of bank ers. Among Die plans which are possi j bly feasible and which certainly should ' receive your consideration is that re ' peaieuij orougnT IO your attention ov the present secretary of the treasury, l the essential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According , to this plan, national banks should be permitted to issue a specified propor tion of their capital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes b:ick when not want' 1 in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional prof its. but to meet the emergency present ed by times of stringency. I do not say that this is the right sys- I teni. I only advance it to emphasize I my belief that there is need for the adoption of some system which shail ■ be automatic and open to all sound ' bank; «o as to avoid all possibility of | discrimination and favoritism. I The law should be amended so as I specifically to prov'de that the funds I derived from <-r, t ni's duties may be j treated by the s<» r< t iry >f the treas j ury as he treats '"iimls obtained under i the internal revenue laws. There j should be a cousV.-rnide increase in j bills of small deno: lijutions. Permis- I sion should ' • given banks, if necessa ry under settled restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger amount than three millions a mouth. Our OutlyinK ro**«***ion*. I mosr earnestly h ipe that the bill to provide a lower tari V for or else abso lute free trade in Philippine products will become a law. No harm will come to any American industry, and, while there will be s ene small but real mate rial benefit to the Filipinos, the main benelit will come by the showing made as to O;T; - purpose to do all in our power for their welfare. I'urlo Iticnu Minim. American citizenship should be con ferred on tiie citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan, in Porto Rico, should be dredged and improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. 

HIWHII. The needs of Hawaii are peculiar. Every aid should be given the islands, and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the lines of a com munity of small freeholders, not of great planters with cooly tilled es tates. AlaNkn. Alaska's needs have been partially met. but there must be a complete re organization of the governmental sys tem, as I have before indicated to you. I ask your especial attention to tills. Our fellow citizens who dwell on the shores of Puget sound with character istic energy are arranging to hold in Seattle the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific ex position. This exposition in its pur poses and scope should appeal not only to the people of the Pacitic slope, but to the people of the I'nited States nt large. MiKlila of Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with justice and good will all immigrants who come here under the law. Whether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or gentile, whether they come from England or Germany, Russia, Japan or Italy, mat ters nothing. All we hare a right to question is the man's conduct. If he Is honest and upright in his dealings with his neighbor and with the state, then he Is entitled to respect and good treatment. Especially do we need to remember our duty to the stranger within our gates. It is the sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against or in any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and who is con ducting himself properly. To remem ber this is incumbent on every Amer ican citizen, and it is of course pecul iarly incumbent on every government official, whether of the nation or of the several states I aui prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there as sumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility is sporadic and Is limited to a ver.\ few places. Never theless it is most discreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught with the gravest cot, sentiences to the nation I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would ask fair treatment for Ger mans or Englishmen. Frenchmen, Rus sians or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity and civilization. I ask it as due to ourselves, because we must act uprightly toward all men. 1 recom mend to the congress that an act be passed specifically providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come here Intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrass ments attending the performance of our International obligations is the fact that the statutes of the United | States are entirely inadequate. They j fail to give to the national government I sufficiently ample power, through Unit ; ed States courts and by the use of the j army and navy, to protect aliens in the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. 1 I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the I'nited States bp so amended and add ed to as to enable the president, acting *t >r the United States government. which Is responsible in our interna ! tional relations, to enforce the rights 1 of aliens under treaties.

CUIMIII Mailer. Last August an insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grew evi dent that the existing Cuban govern ment was powerless to quell. Thanks to the oreunrtMiness of our nnvi I was able immediately to send enough skips to Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless, and I fur thermore dispatched to Cuba the sec-' retat \ of war and the assistant secre tary of state in order that they might , grapple with the situation on the 1 ground. 11l accordance with the so called I I'latt amendment, which was embod ied in the const it ution of Cuba.

When the ! election lins been held and the new government inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashi >n the provisional government will come to an end. The tinted Si ntes wishes nothing of Cuba except that it shall prosper mor ally and on terially ?nd wishes nothing of the I'ltban- :ive that they shall be able to pi 'i-ve older among them selves and ' refore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce and it' the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed on the island it la absolutely out of the question that the island should continue independent, and the I nited States, which bus as sumed the sponsorship before the civ ilized world for Cuba's career as a na tion, would again have to intervene and to <ee that the government was managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. Tlic llio Conference. The second international conference of American republics, held in Mexi co in tlie years l!>nl-02, provided for the holding of the third conference within five years and committed the fixing of the time and place and the arrangements for the conference to the governing board of the bureau of American republics, composed of the representatives of all the American nations in Washington. That board discharged the duty imposed upon it with marked fidelity and pains taking care, and upon the courteous invitation of the I'nited States of Bra zil tin' conference was held at Rio da Janeiro, continuing from the 23d of July to the 2!tfh of August last. Many subjects of .-0111111011 interest to all the American nations were discussed by the conference, and the conclusions reached, embodied in a series of reso lutions and pro.i >sed conventions, will be laid before you upon tlie coming of the final report of the American dele gates. I'll un ma Trip. I have just returned from a trip to Panama and shall report to you at length later on the whole subject of the Panama canal. Tlie AlgeciriiN ( (invention. The Algeciras convention, which was signed by the I'nited States as well as by most of the powers of Europe, su persedes the previous convention of lsso, which was also signed both by the United States and a majority of the European powers. This treaty confers upon us equal commercial rights with all European countries and does not entail a single obligation of any kind upon us, and I earnestly hope it may be speedily ratified. Senliti if. 1 lie destruction of the Pribilof Is land fur seals by pelagic sealing still continues. The herd, which, according to the stirve y made in 1574 by direc tion of the congress, numbered 4,700,- 000, and which, according to the sur vey of both American and Canadian 1 ,tMiii.ii'iti. has now been reduced to about 180,000. This result has been brought about by Canadian and some other sealing vessels killing the female seals while in the water during their annual pilgrimage to and from the south or in search of food. The proc ss of destruction has been accelerated during recent years by the appearance of a number of Japanese ves-els engaged ill pelagic sealing. Suitai.i- representations regarding tlie incident have been made to the gov •ruivent of Japan, and we are as sured that all practicable measures will be taken by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage. We have not relaxed our efforts to secure an agreement with (ireat Brit ai:i for a >■ a ate protection of the seal herd a ill ii ■ .rations with Japan fori the same pm'p are iu progress.
