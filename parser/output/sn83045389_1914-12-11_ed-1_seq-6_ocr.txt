French Government Back In Capital THERE is an Impressive significance in the return of President Poincare, the French Cabinet and the members of the diplomatic corps from Bordeaux to Paris. It proves the strength of the French conviction that the German onslaught has reached its crest, and from now on is certain to ebb. Three months ago German guns were thundering within sound of the French capi tal. Then came the dramatic counterattack, the swift retreat of the Invaders and their decisive defeat in the battle of the Marne, followed by a further retreat close to the Belgian frontier. Now the government feels sufficiently se cure to end its period of exile and return to the ancient city on the banks of the Seine. In French official circles, at least.,' there is no doubt that the war has been decided. Illness of the German Emperor. THE illness of the German Emperor will excite the sympathy even of those who hold him responsible for the tremendous con flict that now rocks Europe, and for all the blood that is being shed. Even his enemies recognize the strength of his personality, the vigor of his intellectual equipment and his intense and patriotic devotion to the interests of his country. The seriousness of his illness remains in doubt. Yesterday a rumor that he was dead spread throughout the world and gained mo mentary credence. It is conceivable that death at this time would prove merciful, far more easy for the Kaiser to face and endure than what now appears inevitable?the abandonment of the offensive in war, the disintegration under attack of his proud and gallant army and the shackling of the empire to which he has consecrated his life. ,i88a 1850 Published every day In the year by The Tlmea DUpateh Publishing Company, Inc.

Edi Bon 6poke while he watched the destruction Wednesday night of his great plant at West Orange, N. J. Tho loss is estimated at be tween $3,000,000 and $5,000,000, and in cludes the destruction of machinery and ap paratus-that were unique and can be re placed with difficulty. But thiB did not discourage Mr. Edison. "Although I am sixty-seven years old," he said, "I'll start all over again to-morrow. I will go right to work to reconstruct the plant." There spoke the American epirit! At an age when most men aro considering retire ment from aetive affairs, and when many highly successful men have retired, this sturdy citizen greets disaster with a smile and rolls up his sleeves for a new bout with destiny. Even at this early stage it is safe to say that alt" is over but the shouting. Edison will win. "Get Back the Land" ' IF IT were not for the exciting times in 1 which we live, It is probable that the report Just submitted to Congress by the United States Commission on Industrial Relations would receive more of the attention which it deserves than is likely to be the. case when so many other matters that look more im portant, but are in reality less so, claim notice. The report embraces testimony taken all over the country from representatives of both tho employes and employers in every class of industry. The chief recommenda tion made is that a Federal employment bureau be established to co-ordinate and su pervise all other major employment agencies, but outside of this the commission does not do much except to report the testimony, which is intended as a guide in suggesting legislation'. The commission's report does, however, lay stress on the fact that labor unrest is as widespread on the farm as it is in the factory. As a substitute for "back to the land" the commission suggests "get back the land," and it proceeds to point out that a gradual alienation ot the worker from the land has taken place. This most menacing condition Is attributed mainly to the uncertainty and Irregularity of employment, the large hold Ings in the hands of corporations and indi viduals and the "marked growth of the tenant system of farming." Tfils testimony only corroborates what Im partial students have been telling the people for years?that the United States Is travel ing the same road to the same monopoliza tion of land In a few hands as has been traversed by the great nations' of Europe. In England this process of alienating the mass of the people from the soil has reached such an acute stage that within the past few years the most radical legislation-? called confiscation by some?has been adopted, with apparently little hope of effect ing a solution. In Germauy, the Junkers, or large landowners, are charged with pre venting the democratization of the empire, and so with being responsible for the present war. Patriotic Americans are furnished with ample food for anxious thought in the re port of the Industrial Relations Commission. In the South, the question of land tenure has a particularly vital Importance. Germany Vanishes Prom Southern Seas 

GERMAN sea power vanished practically from the Southern seas with the de struction in the naval buttle off the Falkland Islands, on Tuesday last, of the armored cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau,.the for mer the flagship of Admiral von Spee, and the light cruiser Leipzig. The Leipzig was of no great military importance, save as a destroyer of commerce, but the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau were powerful vessels of war, whose heavy batteries had proved quite competent to the destruction of Admiral Cradock's fleet. The Nurnberg was sunk later in the day, and the Dresden, which also look part in the battle on Tuesday, is said to have been cor nered. It, however, is of the class of the Leipzig, and even if it makes good its flight, little of Germany's naval strength on this side of the ocean will have been preserved. It cannot put up a fight against the heavier units of the British cruiser squadrons; it can only continue to harass British and allied commerce, and itB capacity even to do that becomes very doubtful. It is more than likely that in a few dayB it will be report ed destroyed, captured or interned in some neutral port. , One significant feature of this latest naval action, which it holds in common with others rjof the present war, cannot escape attention. That is the almost total loss of life on the vessels destroyed and sunk. In the old days, wooden men-of-war kept afloat at least long enough to permit a merciful victor to rescue the vanquished. At the worst, the vanquished took to their boats. To-day the boats go overboard when the ships are cleared for action, and the great craft themselves sink when their steel hulls are riddled. There is rejoicing in London that British naval efficiency lias been vindicated. There had been a train of disasters that the destruc tion of the Emden and other minor successes had not served to offset In the British mind. Now there is revived and justified confidence. Britannia still rules the waves! American Army's True Function 

SECRETARY OF WAR GARRISON'S recom mendation that the army be recruited to its full war strength, which will involve the addition of about 1,000 officers and 25,000 men to tho existing personnel, is in entire accord with the views expressed by Presi dent Wilson in'his message to Congress. The President declared that the army and navy should be kept In a condition of preparedness and efficiency, and that condition for the army Is what. Secretary Garrison wants to attain. That does not mean that the country should prepare for war, or that it would be pre pared for war after the suggested enlistments | had been obtained. An army of 120,000 men, distributed over continental United States, Alaska, the Isthmus of Panama, Porto Rico, Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines, would not be likely to prove a formidable antagonist to any strong military power that chose to attack this country. The nation must still rely, as It always I has relied, on a citizen soldiery. The stand ing army is a mere nucleus of the nation's defense. It will remain so intll those ideals on which the fathers builded an American Commonwealth are surrendered to the jingo, the blusterer, tho "forceful aggressor" and the international swaggerer and bully. Belgian Immigration for the South 

MATTERS of great importance to Virginia and the South will be considered to morrow at Washington, where the sessions of the Immigration Conference will be held. Governor Stuart is expected to attend and to contribute to the discussion. It is taken for granted that the wisdom and practicability of inducing the immigra tion to Southern States of Belgian artisans and agriculturists, especially the latter, will be treated by some of the speakers, and it is not impossible that some tentative plan for dealing with this situation will be framed. Thero could be no finer illustration of con structive benevolence than the bringing of eome of these unfortunate people to this country and (he South, establishing them on farms and permitting them to rebuild their shattered fortunes. The subject is a ditftcult out, however, and requires wise handling. It would be a stupid policy to urge the im migration here of men and women unfitted to cope with difficulties and survive iuitial dis appointments, and tho proposed settlers should be selected with sound discretion. Connie Mack says he will "stick to Phila delphia," which is a Christian spirit to dis play, because Philadelphia, last season at any i rate, showed no particular determination to j stick to him. Despite tho statements of the elongated manager, the rumor that he will manage the New York Highlanders will not down and may be verified by the fact. Perhaps it's a pity that the country should pay its President $75,000 a year when so many newspaper paragraphers would take the job for considerably less. It will be hoped that,the antiadministration Congressmen will not try to prove that their constituencies are made up exclusively of calamity-howlers. Gold coins are disappearing from Cali fornia. They can't blame that on Governor Hiram Johnson. It is silence that is golden. The only class of European exports which shows an increase is that which sends men from life to death. It shouid not be forgotten that'tho Army and Navy were inherited from the Republi cans. As Christmas gifts, cannon balls are all the rage this year among European royalties.

Chats With Virginia Editors "Tho Storm King Is also at the front," Is the way the Norfolk Ledger-Dispatch comments upon his heavy reign In that city the past week. " 'Surgeons Build New Faces,">eads headline; and It must be admitted that the average face could not be made the worse looking by being built anew," says the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot. The situation is not so had as it looks, however. The faces within that writer's range of vision are made in Norfolk. Says the Danville Bee: "Having the blues used to be regarded chiefly as a feminine habit, but there are many men who will confess to spells of despondency and a morbid, unusual view of things generally." The fellow with plenty of red corpuscles can't have the blues. Cheerful George Qreen, of the Clifton Forge Review, has discovered another opportunity for singing the praises of that man's town. He says: "Clifton Forge is unique in that there is no other town or city in the United States bear ing the same name; therefore, when the name of Clifton Forge is mentioned, everybody knows without the asking that it Is In Virginia, Not so with Covington, Richmond, Lexington, Ports mouth, Danville and numerous other places," Clifton Forge is not unique in having an editor who believes in boosting his town to the limit, but It is conspicuously fortunate. Editor Ople, of the Staunton Leader, admits that he is eagerly waiting for an explanation from Champ Clark. He says: "Many persons will bo surprised to learn that Champ ^31ark, Democratic Speaker of the House of Represen tatives, has been charged with appearing on a platform to lecture in Detroit while drunk." Per haps Champ knows Detroit audiences better than Editor Ople. Not every orator would voluntar ily appear before a Detroit crowd sober. "There are several alleged governments In Mexico, but the Vlllalstas. Zapatistas and Gutl errezistas hold the capital," the Bristol Herald Courler observes. Some American investors, who have paid Presidents of Mexico for conces sions, are well aware of the capacity of those fellows for holding capital. Says the paragrapher of the Norfolk Ledger Dispatch: "Some family trees are not much more than a gooseberry bush." Others better developed could stand a great deal of pruning. Current Editorial Comment Since Paris, the second son of Whitman Priam, dreamed of by Hecuba as i> ? -oo Hio a firebrand, met Hera and Athene i roves riis and Aphroditu face to face, and Bravery. balancing their offerings, award ed the golden apple of discord to the Goddess of Beauty, no male person has ever been put in so embarrassing a position as Charles S. Whitman accepted when he in vited the suffragists and the antisuffragists to his home, and let them talk it out with him; tlnally announcing that he would not stand in the* way of suffrage. Mr. Whitman Is recog nized by all the policemen and all the gunmen of New York City as a brave man. He proved it yesterday. The mouth of a cannon, as we believe the late Miles Standish once remarked, is as nothing, compared with the mouth of one woman. The fellow who can face fifty at once, divided into two hostile groups and seeking to drag him apart, to disintegrate him, is Indeed courageous. Thq Judgment of Paris, A. D. 1914, has been rendered. We anticipate none of the old Trojan horrors, though more than one anti is ready to take the role of Cassandra. In the Celestial minds of to-day, so much of wrath is missing. Whitman will not have to call in the Albany Fire Department. But that he will escape some minor annoyance, 1b not to be hoped. They are the penalties of fearlessness In politics.?Brooklyn Eagle. The Kaiser sowed to willing AVntterson soil- Yet> Instead of fruitful r.n \v.i?.'o harvest, he shall reap desolation ? and ruin, which wiser men?even Uiuccmie. instinct of the people? might have foreseen. On this account Germany represents tho elements and agenclts of war, and war alone, while Eng land?we may for the present leave Russia and France out of the reckoning?stands for what ever of peace \aid in public opinion the future may have for the stricken sons of men; the triumph of Germany meaning that tho world must become and remain an armed camp, tho triumph of England meaning the readjustment of Its affairs upon some agreed basis shaped by the enlightened interests of "Chrlstondom. Grant for the sake of tho argument, that In religion and morals England is as great a hypocrito as her enemies say she is; in her policies as great a glutton. Yet the people of England have their say in the government of England. Absolutism has as poor standing there as it has hero. Eng lish statesmen, like American statesmen, must consider and consult the voters. In tho final equation, they, must and will defer to us. Germany, on the other hand, will only turn to us In dire need. The warp and woof of Ger man society, which Is the German government. Is aristocratic. The autocracy of the Kaiser, never much questioned, would be unchallenged If hta armies should come forth victorious. That would spell world conquest, and God has thus far denied world conquest alike In nations and men. The law of force against force will de termine this war, the greater against the less, however, superior in equipment and fighting quality tne less may be.

War News Fifty Years Ago From the Rlohmond Dispatch, Dec. 11, 1864.) The snow oontlnues to fall In Richmond and on all of the military lines frontiug Richmond, and snow has a tendency to suspend military operations for the time being. An attack by the Federals on the Confederate lines was con fidently expectod yesterday, but the Interdict of Old Winter was effectual, and probably will be again to-day. It Is true that the enemy crossed a small forco of Infantry to the south side of the James a few days ago. They crossed' at Cox's Landing, near the mouth of the Dutch Gap canal and below Battery Simms. but they got no further. They are upon the neck of the low grounds where they can do nothing, and certainly can not advance. General Pickett is closely watch ing thetp. He realizes that there can be no good to hold this position with our forces, excep't to keep the enemy In cheok should their purpose be to make a hurried advance on Richmond. There Is no truth in the report that the enemy had crossed the James River at a point higher up than Dutch Gap. The latest Information from Petersburg is to the effect that tho force sent by General Grant towards Weldon consists of an entire army corps. There Is no reason why every man of them should not be killed or captured before they get fifty miles from Petersburg. The latest news from Georgia Is several days late. It tellB us that Sherman's marching army Is now not over 20,000 strong, counting muskets as strength. At last accounts thesp men were on the east side of the Ogeechee River, and were marching ? slowly, making less than eighteen miles per day. The latest Information is that former informa tion to the effect that Sheridan had joined Grant is untrue. Sheridan, with the most of his army is still in the Valley, and Early proposes to keep them there. It may be that some of Sheridan's troops have been sent to Grant. So much the better for Early. The Washington Chronicle, a copy of which is just to hand, says: "Harding, the man who, In England, recently married Belle Boyd, the famous female Confederate spy, was caught the other day at Martinsburg, Va., and is now in carcerated In the Old Capitol Prison, He says that since he married .Belle Boyd In England she has been discarded by the Confederate sympa thizers in that country, and he has Instructed her to have nothing further to do with the Confederate cause." Harding explains his trip to Martinsburg by saying he went there to bring away Manie Boyd, his young sister-in-law. Snow is on the ground and more of it coming; the soldiers are fighting to a finish on the front; Christmas goods are scarce, and money is scarce, and Santa Claus Is tabooed, but all the same the theatres and all of the places of amusement are open, and one of them advertises Itself as being the "Carnival of Fun." A very curious time in which to have a carnival of fun. Sam Clarke, a hard-up Confederate soldier, was arraigned in the Magistrate's Court yester day morning, charged with stealing a hog from Henry Smith, corner of Cary and Virginia Streets, the same hog being valued at |800. Clarke quietly and composedly confessed his guilt, saying he was hard up and had to raise the wind in some way to feed his family while he was on tho front defending Richmond. He sold the hog to J. H. Lambert, a butcher on the market, for 5300. To keep the record Btralght, Clarke was 'sent on to the grand Jury, but no bond was required, and this will be the last of the case. A Confederate soldier who takes a hog to feed his family while he fights need have no fear. The Voice of the People \Vork of Confederate Hmeum. To the Editor of The Tlmes-Dlspatch: Sir,?As president of the Confederate Me morial Literary Society, I am deeply Interested in all matters pertaining to the Confederacy. The article in the Sunday issue of the Rich mond Tlmes-Dlspatch of November 22d, entitled, "Home of Jefferson Davis Attracts Many Vis itors" has pleased me immensely. It Is certainly a most admirable article, and one that will greatly enlighten many of our young people who probably do not know that the Confederate Museum exists. It Is most important that this museum be endowed In this generation, and If more of our newspapejs would do us the honor to describe the work as well and interestingly as The Times-Dispatch has done, public Interest might be sufficiently aroused to push the endowment forward to completion. Please allow me to extend to you my personal, as well as my official, thanks and appreciation. 

SALLY ARCHER ANDERSON'. Richmond, December 7, 1914. Wan to a Good Fellow Club. To the Editor of The Times-Dispatch: Sir,? The splendid response of Richmond to the call for help for the strlokon Belgians, and now for the needy in this city. Is worthy of the highest praise. It is not too much to say that the public will Justify the reputation of Rich mond for Its generosity, albeit the burden is heavy. There is wanting at this time a co-op eration of all who can do so in order that the help provided for the needy may reach as many as possible. To accomplish this, a Good Fellow Club should bo formed, as In many other" cities. It is obvious that a few hundred men, ao or ganized, from every part of Greater Richmond, could be of great value to the various dis pensers of food, wood, coal and clothing. As an instance, the writer knows of one family in South Richmond that needs, and must have, help.. It is no reflection on the Associated Chari ties, Salvation Army ai?(T the many church societies to say that they cannot cope with the overwhelming demands that are certain to be made upon them this winter. A band of goo<i fellows can, however, make it possible to reach tho maximum of sufferers, which is so much to be desired. .

One Is from a for mer Confederate soldier; the other from a woman In one of Britain's distant colonies. Captain Edgar .T. Franklin, who fought for the Confederacy In the War Between the States, writing from ! London on October 12, says: "Pray accept, on behalf of the allies | and your sincere friend, the warmest j thanks for your and your dear country men and countrywomen's sympathy with us In this dreadful war brought on us by the Huns.

"That was great the way the Indian troops were brought across Canada, and - j they are the soldiers the Germane need against them. The Indians plan for themselves and have worked some nice" little surprises and tricks on the Kais er's troops, already. Our own Maoris are so anxious to go, a few will be sent, but the government does not wish them to go, as they are a fine race, dying out fast enough already. "You will say my letter 1b all war, but it Is all we live for now. Wa are fighting for what is dearer than life?'our flag'?tho dear old .flag "of England. Long may it float!

It makes us proud over here, and our hearts thrill to think we are one with such an | empire. My little ones pray every day i for our armies." . THE COMMAND OF THE SEA "The command of the sea" Is an ex pression that has been so long familiar that we aro, surprised to realize that we have had an entirely Indefinite corn prehension of how this power would be applied in case of necessity, and how it would operate. As a matter of fact, there are many ways in which ' such domination can make itself ef fective. and in the present hostile oper ations it has come as a complete block ade of Germany and her fleet, In spito of tho actually formidable power of I the latter. What this means to Ger many, and the vital results of such a blockade to Germany, are told in anedi torial In the Scientific American, as follows: The command of the sea! Let us con sider what the acceptance of the block ade of her main fighting fleet has meant to Germany. In the first place, it haB resulted in the complete disappearance from all the seven seas of her vast merchant marine, such of her ships as escaped : capture having fled to neutral ports or i to her own protected bases on the North I Sea and the Baltic. Her colonial pos- j sessions, In the acquisition and up- | building of which she has expended ; so much energy and treasure, being ab- I eolutely Cut off from any military or i naval assistance. have passed one by i one to the enemy. Hor warships on J foreign stations,, after a series of ex ploits In commerce destroying and en gagements with the enemy, which will form one of the brightest chapters iiv the history of her navy, are being grad ually sunk or driven Into neutral ports. Finally, her oversea trado, except through a few neutral ports, has ceased : to.exist. But it Is not In these respects that ! the sll?nt victory of the war Is mak ing Its pressure most keenly felt In Ihls. lifo-and-death struggle of the great Gorman empire. It Is In St3 hearing upon the military operations in France and Belgium that the Brit ish command of the sea Is oxerclslng an influenco, so dominant that It al ready promises to be tho decisive fac tor In the whole situation. Had the conditions been reversed; had the Oirman fleet been superior in strength; or had the weaker fleet, by virtue of its superior materia), personnel strategy- and tactics, been able to de feat the British and French in a series of decisive engagements, not a single regiment of British troops could have been sent to the western theatre . of wav.
