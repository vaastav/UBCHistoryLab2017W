The House bill to. repeal tho resump tlon act was read and referred. Consideration was resumed of the re solution to discharge the Committee on Privileges and Elections from further consideration of the credentials of M. C. Butler claiming a Beat as Senator from South Carolina. Senator Davis, or Illinois, made a speech, saving that the delay of the Com mittee in reporting on the Keuogg case had given the Butler case precedence. lie was answered by senator lultnunds. ofVt. Senator Patterson spoke, claim ing that Gen. Butler was elected Senator bv a Legislature which the highest courts of his State had declared to be a legal body; the people of South Carolina be lieved him to be legally elected; he him self believed that If Hampton was elected Governor, by the same vote the legisla ture which elected Butler was constituted the legal representative and law-making power of the State, senator cenover also made a speech in explanation 01 ma vote. In the course of the debate Mr Ed munds read a Washington dispatch to the New York Tribune of Friday last in regard to Mr. Patterson's vote, .and a consultation between him and Butler in the cloak room of the Senate, in which the latter ordered Patterson to go in and vote. Mr. Edmunds thought this mat ter worthy of inquiry, and therefore moved a committee of Inquiry to report whether any unlawful arrangement had been made by Butler to influence the vote of any Senator. Mr. Edmunds' proposition was defeat ed, yeas, 27 ; nays, 30. Messrs. Matthews. Davis (111.), Patterson, and Conover voted with the Democrats, in me negative. Various flllibustering motions' were then made the object of the Republicans being to postpone a vote until Tuesday, when the report in Kellogg's case would come first in order. The Republicans managed to get in the reading of the evi dence and brief of Corbln in tho Butler case containing-fifty or sixty pgos of closely printed matter, which carried tne session over until morning. If the Republicans cannot carry the motion to adjourn, they favor a continua tion of the session till 12 o'clock to-morrow, when Mr. Kellogg's case, reported upon by the Committee on Privileges and Elections vesterdav. will le called up and a motion made to give it precedence over the Buflcr case.

Sherman has Issued a general order from the headquarters of tbe army, in which he says : MThe Pres ident is much concerned to nod before him for action proceedings of court- maruais in several cases where the of fences have been tried for violation of the 38th article of war, which provides that any omcer found drunk on uuty shall be dismissed from the service. The President desires it to be made known to tbe army that he cannot be led to underrate the magnitude of the evil which the crime alluded to is like ly to produce in the publio service. No person addicted to it can expect to be trusted with any responsible duty and a person who cannot be trusted bad better not be continued in ofllce. It must therefore be understood that any clemency which may have been heretofore extended, by mitigation or commutation of sentence, cannot here after be relied upon as a basis of hope ror use ravorabie action. After this solemn warning, a vigorous execution of the sentence imposed in due course by the court martial may be ex pec ted." Tne Commissioner of Internal Key enue has handed In his report to riec retary. It shows, during the last fis cal year, 4,902 distilleries registered. and 4,510 operated. The net aggregate increase receipts rrom tne several sources relating to distilled spirits for ine nscai year is i, 03,31. The tax on deposits, capital, etc.. circulation of banks, etc., in the fiscal year ending June 3U, 1877, was 93, 437 less than in the previous year. The total collections from tobacco for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877. were C4i,iuu,o40. There was a hand-to-hand fight In tne Benate on Thursday ,over tbe South Carolina and Louisiana election cases. The Democrats desired to bring for ward the case of M. C. Butler before that of Kellogg, and by admitting But ler obtain a majority by which to reject iveiiogg. Tho iiepubiicans wished to admit Kellogg first, thereby retaining their supremacy in the Senate and power to reject Butler. It was plainly a fkrht for political supremacy. Hen- of Florida, voted with the Democrats. giving them, in the absence of Senator H baron or isevada, a majority. Final ly, uonover voted with tne Kepubll- cans for an adjournment until Monday giving a tie vote, wmcn was decided by the casting vote of vice President Wheeler in the affirmative. This vote of the Vice President's is said to be the first deciding vote cast by a vice President, on a political question, since Millard Fillmore pre sided in 1849. The reason given by Senators Pat terson and Conover for their action is that they must concllliate the ruling power in tne tsoutn. On the Repeal bill 30 Republicans voted aye and 23 Democrats voted no. Alabama, Arkansas, Ueorgla, Indiana, Kansas. Kentucky. Mississippi and West Virginia were solid in favor of the repeal, and California, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota. Nebraska, Nevada, New York, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont were solid against it. Tbe commissioner of internal reve nue, lr his annual report, says that not less than 3,000 illicit stills have been operated in the Southern States in inaccessible points, generally by ig norant and armed men. illicit tobacco manufacturers are of a different class. lie recommends strengthening the force of collectors and marshals in these districts, and favors no change in the tux on spirits, tobacco or fruit brandy. He thinks tbe law taxing matches could with propriety be re pealed, and aisoir tne nnanciai inter ests would warrant it the tax on bonds and checks. The collections for the past fiscal year were $157,043,840. University Hospital The faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery desire to an nounce that the University Hospital is now open for the reception of patients. Bv the generosity of the last Legis lature great improvements have been made in the equipment and accommo dations of the hospital, so that every provision lias been secured for the comfort and treatment of the sick and afillcted. An efficient resident physician has been appointed by the Board of Re gents and the services of thoroughly qualified nurses have been secured The hospital will now continue in full operation throughout the entire year, and members or the faculty of the De partment or Medicine and surgery will be in daily attendance. From October 1 to July 1. the fore noon of each Wednesday and Saturday will be devoted to the examination and treatment of patients at the clinic, and patients arriving on the morning of those days may proceed directly to the Medical College on East Uuiverslty avenue. Those arriving on other days mav go directly to the hospital, where their wants will be at once attended to by the resident physician. All services rendered by the medical faculty are absolutely free of charge. Patients will be charged for board dur ing the time they stay in the hospital at the rate of (5 per week. The attention or tne supervisors or the various counties is Invited to the opportunity which is here afforded for tne reuer or caes sucn as are ire- Juently met with, in the County louses, and which are permitted to languish and sometimes to die for want of those special appliances for their relief or cure which can only be furnished by a .well equipped public hospital. it is respectfully submitted mat iy the trivial expense of transportation and board much human suffering may in this way be relieved, and an Im portant saving to the State be secured.

Showing the results of scientlflo farming, while Austria produces on one square mile 3.70G head of stock. Prussia, within the same limits, raises 5,637, France 5,070, Ureal Britain 11,447. In Belgium, where agriculture is most naturally pursued, a square mile produces means of nourishment for 7,345 persons, whereas in Poland tbe farming produces food for only 2,229 persons per square mile, and tak ing the world at large, a far Jess aver age than this is obtained. A good deal of Interest has been felt by scientific men in the experiments made by rroressor ciark, or the Am herst Agricultural College, on the lift lng power of growing plants, and one or tne results which has attracted as much attention as any, is his discovery that the greatest weight lifted by a growing pumpkin, in the course of its development, is nearly two and a half tons. To facilitate the parturition of cows. the administration of a few handfulls of linseed with their drink for three or four weeks before their calving, is strongly recommended by a writer in the Lindwlrth, a German agricultural Eaper.

HOW TO 

HAVE HEALTHY PIC1S. Prof. Law of Cornell University writes as follows iu regard to the prop er treatment or swine for the preven tlon of disease:' "Keep your hogs clean. Protect them from the hot, reeking bed of manure and close sleep ing place, where the emanations rrom decomposing dung, urine, straw, and other organic matter, are added to those of their own skins and lungs when huddled together in great num bers. See that both food and water are clean, iu the sense of being free from disease germs, and from the mi croscopic particles of decomposing or ganic matter, which, within the sys tem as wen as outside it, rurnisn ap propriate food for tbe disease poisons. and favor its increase, while they de press the vital powers, and lessen the chances of the virus being thrown oif. And it is here that the pork-raisers are most frequently at fault. Fifty or an hundred pigs are allowed to crowd to gether in a filthy manure heap, a rot ten straw stacks or under a barn, sub jected to the droppings of other ani mals, as wen as their own products. Their feeding-troughs and drinking water are so supplied that they can get into them with their filthy feet, and they must devour the most obnox- iuuo UAa.bva va dm t v M uuuvi 10 abuse, disease is developed,the healthy are left with the sick, as 'they will all have it anyway and the result is usually a clean sweep." Tlio Temptation to Overstock. It is often hard to resist the tempta tion to overstock our farms, and yet is a very great mistake to do so. It is not eare to conclude that because a few cows or chickens give a certain re turn; double the number would yield double the profit. There is a limit which It Is not safe to pass, as beyond that the animals receive proportion ately less food and care. When over stocked, the question natarally is, how far can I make my feed go? The re sult is a stinting policy, which never pays. In my own experience, 1 am convinced that I kept too much stock, considering the conveniences, and the amount of food I could grow for them. Not that I stinted my stock, butonthe contrary purchased every winter large quantities of hay and grain, but could not realize any profit with nay at $25 and meal at $40 per ton. Young, grow ing stock, especially, need an abuud ance of nutritious food, good water and warm winter quarters. Yet those, and the dry cows, are most likely to suffer when feed is scarce. It is expensive raising such stock where hay and grain bring a high price. Better butcher a poor calf than attempt to raise it ; but when a first-rate one Is preserved no pains or expense should be spared to develop It into a superior animal. . A tun ted calf wlir never grow to be a rofl table cow. I have, upon several occasions, visited tho herds of noted breeders of Jersey cattle, and could but notice the difference between their young stocK, comrortamy nouseu, cleanly kept, abundantly fed, and the stock of many farmers, depending for both nourishment and shelter upon a straw stack, or perhaps an open shed for shelter and over-ripe hay ror food. I cannot understand how any man can, with a clear conscience, partake of warm, appetizing food, and enjoy the comforts or a cneenui nre ana warm bed. while his cattle are shiver ing with cold and trying to fill them selves with trash only fit for the manure heap. I'll never have that sin to answer lor, but always fill up the mangers with early cut hay, and bed the stock knee-deep with clean straw, before leaving the barn at night. Wm. iv. Ucekman, in JS. r. Tribune. AVoocl Ashes. r A series of experiments detailed In the American Agriculturist by Prof. Atwater, of the Wesleyan University, Mlddletown, Conn., speaks volumes as to the value of ashes, both unleached and leached. Ashes brought the best returns for the money expended, and horse manure the next. The Professor Is of the opinion that even leached ashes, costing from 18c. to 28c. er bushel, are more promauie man super phosphate at $45 per ton, or guano at $00. In many localities leached ashes ran be had for the trouble of hauling, an J 20c. per load is the highest price we have known to be demanded when 1 a charge Is made for them. A dressing of GO bushels to the acre, about two wap on loads, will produce very per centlble and profitable results. In view of such facts as these, is it not surpris ing that fanners will aver rsll a bi:;h tl cf txhes, cr nrrtt to avtll them- lr:a cri:-r.:3 r--j r7:n tr.rr tra in rr-i-zihl Va tL:: v.! 1 Lira never tried this fertilizer, we earnestly commend at least some experiments with It, firmly believing that It rankc high among neglected manures. - THE HOUOEHOLD. BOITSO 91 MBS aO. XATOa. To most cooks the presentation of an old fowl as a foundation for the mor row's dinner, is the occasion for sharp comment, or satirical reflection, some times even starting a theological dls cussion regarding its antidiluvlan his tory, etc. But a writer In the Fancier's Journal disputes the Idea that only young and tender fowls are fit tor table use. He says: "You may talk about your Spring chickens, but give me setting hen, or rather a hen that has hatched three broods successively, and Sot down to skin and bone, and has een fed liberally, until the bones are covered with flesh. When she Is in condition, ready to begin laying, off with ber head. You will have the chicken flesh iu its prime." The rea son is obvious. The flesh of the old fowl which has been rapidly fattened Is newly made, and largely composed or rat, consequently mucn better tnan that of a young fowl, which has been slowly made and the muscles tough ened for serviceable strength. The same thing is well known by butchers, in regard to all animals slaughtered for food. Many a dealer has been ac cused of untruthfulness, from a lack of knowledge of this fact, by tbe con sumer of meats expecting the flesh of a young animal must necessarily be juicy and tender. Fricasee Chickens. Wash the chickens and divide them into pieces, put them in a pot or stew-pan, with several slices of salt haw, or pork, and sprinkle each laver with salt and pep per, cover them with water, and let them simmer till tender, keeping them covered. Then taKe inem up and mix with the gravy a piece of but ter the size of a hen's egg, and a paste made of two tablespoon fuls of flour wet up with a small portion of the gravy. Put back the chickens and let them stew five minutes. Then spread crackers, stale or toasted bread on a platter, lay tho chickens on It, and pour the gravy over. In case it is wished to nave them browned, take them out when nearly done, and fry them in butter till brown, or pour oil all the liquid and fry tnem in the pot, in which case you can. make a nice gravy or the liquid. Chicken Croquets. Take an or dinary sized chicken ; let it be tender. Boil in as little water as possible until done ; reduce the broth to about a cup full after you have taken up the fowl. Mince the meat very fine, rejecting all the skin. Chop one small onion very fine and fry in two tablespoons of butter and one or nour, stir three min utes, add the meat, broth, one tea- spoonful of fine chopped parsley, half a ooiieu sweet ureau, miuceu, sail, pepper, and twenty drops of extract of nutmeg ; stir all together three min utes over the fire. Take up and stir in the yolks of three raw eggs until it Is a gelatinous mass. Spread out in a dish and when entirely cold mould into forms, using one tablespoonful for each. They may be formed like a sausage, a small biscuit, or a tiny sugar loaf. Dip them into beaten egg and roll into very fine bread crumbs. Drop carefully into boiling lard, and let them remain just long enough to get a light brown color, then they will be crisp outside and soft inside. Gar nish with sprigs of parsley. Fried Chicken. Cut up young chickens, put them in a pan with u very little water, cover closely and put them in a hot oven ; let them cook until tender, then remove, roll them well in flour, and brown nicely in but ter, in a frying pan on top of stove. . Chicken Pie. Take two full grown chickens, or more if they are small, disjoint them, cut the backbone, etc., as small as convenient. Boll them with a few slices of salt pork in water enough to cover them, let them boll quite tender, then take out the breast bone. After they boil and tbe scum is taken otf, put in a little onion cut very fine, not enough to taste dis tinctly, but Just enough to flavor a little: rub some parsley very fine when dry, or cut fine when green this gives a pleasant flavor, season wen wnu repperand salt, and a few ounces of good fresh butter. When all is cooked well, have enough liquid to cover the chicken, then beat two eggs and stir in some sweet cream. Line a five quart pan with a crust made like soda biscuit, only more shortening, put iu the chicken and liquid, then cover with a crust the same as the lining. Bake till the crust is done and you will have a good chicken pie Chicken Pot-pie. Cut up and par boil a pair of large fowls, seasoning them with pepper, salt and nutmeg. You may add some small slices of cold ham : in which case use no salt, as the ham will mako it salt enough. Or you may put in some pieces of the lean of fresh pork. You may prepare a suet- Easte; but ror acmcKen pot-pie it is est to make the paste of butter, which should be fresh and of the best quality. Allow to each quart oriiour a small half pound of butter. There should be enough for a great. deal of paste. Line the sides or the pot, two-thirds up, with paste. Putin the chickens with the liquor in which they were par boiled. You may add some sliced po tatoes. Intersperse the pieces of chicken with layers of paste in square slices. Then cover the whole with a lid of taste not fitting very closely. Make across slit in the top, and boil the pie about an hour or more. Dressing for Roast Fowls. In stead of stuffing In the usual way, take three or four thin slices of salt pork, and put them in alternately with the heart, liver, ana gizzard, 'men tie the wings and legs down closely, and boll in water with salt and pepper, un til about half an hour before serving. Then have a quick oven, put it In and let it brown nicely, and we think you will try it again. Another dresslng.to be used on "extra occasions," will be found Incomparable. Spread pieces of stale, but tender, wheaten bread liber ally with butter, and season rather highly with salt and pepper, working these condiments into tbe butter k little ; then dip the bread in wine, and use it In as large piecesas is convenient to stuff the bird. The delicious flavor which the wine gives is very penetrat ing, and It gives the fowl a rich.gamey character, which is very pleasant. A South Bend man. of non-church going habits, recently strayed into a church at Niles. He entered just after the services began, and just as he pass ed into the aisle the congregation rou to sing, but thinking It was out of courtesy to him, he exclaimed, in a voice heard all over the church : "Sit down, sit down, I can find a seat' The bible says there Is a time to laugh. nnd that congregation thought the time had come. A man should never be ashamed t own he has been in the wrong, whicl is but saying in other words that he t wiser today than he was yesteruay Some women love to praise their husbands.

CCISNTUFIO NOTES 1 1 Is understood that durlngthe Paris International Exhibition there will be tests made of the various msthodj cf lighting streets and buildings with electricity, and the relative value of the different systems, will be deter mined. One division of ths Exhibi tion is to be devoted exclusively to electricity. Although it is considered that the light afforded by electricity is rar superior to any otherwise available, some difference of opinion exists re garding the superiority of the several apparatus now introduced, and the comparative expense, -Measures are to betaken to insure tho utmost im partiality in the experiments, and the result will be anticipated with great interest. A Liverpool correspondent of the English Mechanic describes an engine In which gunpowder was to give the motive power. There was a cylinder, etc.. like the corresponding parts of a high-pressure steam engine. Outside the cylinder was a brass wire, heated by a lamp. The supply of gunpowder was in a hopper rrom which a plug tap revolving with the fly-wheel, carried a small quantity of gunpowder, and at a certain point in the movement dropped the portion of powder on tbe rea not wire. Tne worstng or tne en gine is thus epitomized : "The theory was beautiful: but upon the first trial unfortunately the whole aflalr 'went off so completely,' (very nearly taking father's head along with it), that he 'let it went,' and did not make any mnrn II If the descriptions are not overdrawn a remarkably convenient small steam engine has been Invented In Phlladel phla. It la an oscilllating engine, at tached to a tank holding about two gallons of water. The boiler is of about a quart capacity: the steam chest about half that size: the whole concern occupies a space of about ten inches square and eighteen inches high, and weighs S5 pounds. It is designed for use with any sort of light machinery, ana is said to be suit able for a variety of domestlo work. The details of the contrivance are not yet stated, but assurances are given that it cannot, under any circum stances, explode, that it is as manage able as an ordinary gas burner, sluce the inventor has succeeded in dispens ing with water and steam gauges and automatic floats, so that the whole ap paratus is simple, and no skill is required to operate it. The kitchen ot the future is expect ed to contain one or these en gines to chop hash, turn the coffee mill and the roasting jack, sift ashes and mangle the family linen. Girls' Attitude to Young Men There Is a thing of which I want to speak, and that is the behavior of girls to-wara young men who are not lovers but simply friends. Let me tell you Elainly that our sex were not meant to e wooers. The custom prevalent among a certain class of young ladles asking, directly or indirectly, the at tention of young gentlemen Is not an admirable custom. "My son," said a lady to me not long since, is much pre- judiced against a certain young girl, wnom 1 aamire, because she is con stantly sending him notes inviting him to be her escort here and there. and planning to have him with her.'' A modest and dignified reserve, which is neither prudery nor affectation. should distinguish your manner to gentlemen. Too great familiarity and too evident pleasure in the society of young men are errors Into which no delicate and pure minded girl should fall. A Lady' a Letter. WHY HE SUCCEEDED. THE MYSTEUY SOLVED (Shakespeare tells us that "Some men are born great, some achieve greatness, while others have greatness thrust upon them." Still tbe Bard of Avon foreot to mention that some men are born low in tbe social scale, some achieve poverty, while others have "hard-up-neas" thrust upon them. The latter was the cose with Solomon J. Stebbins, who, from the hour of bis birth, was one of thoss unfortunate individuals whom nature had destined to live in a chronic state of luinfortune. Nervous as a kitten and untidy an the man who tums off your gas if the bill is not paid to the second, he obtained a situation as advertising agent foi a weekly periodical. He got one contract in two months and was to receive fifteen per cent commission, but the firm went up, and Solo mon went down sorrowful to his home. . After being out of employment about five months, during which time he was provided for by a maiden aunt, his Btepmother died, leaving him heir of some two or three hun dred dollars. Solomon was no fool and did not follow the example of the notorious nrodieal son who snent his money in riotous s.iving and bad tobacco. On the contrary, he invested his capital in a cigar store, but. like many other foolish men in his business, bought a large assortment of meershaum pipes and high-priced cigars. He very soon found out his mistake and was beginning to look like a sick cat that had been left on a doorstep by a moving - family, when a tra veller called, and, taking a small package from his vest pocket, invited Sol to try a little, lie did so, and Mr. fcaxbr (not of the Western Era but the original of 'Saxby's Pride") felt somewhat alarmed to ee the face of Air. Stebbins change from the hape of an elongated frying pan to that of a married man who had been presented with twins for the first time. How do you like ihatV' asked the traveler. "Like it?" said Sol, "why I never tasted anything half so delicious. Mock turtle soup is a fool to this and Point Look Out oysters sink into insignificance by its side I What do you call ltr "That is the Walker, McUraw Co't Globe chewing tobacco." "Heavens I" exclaimed the astonished vendor of the weed that cheers but not inebriates, "I thought it was candy 1" To make a long story short, Solomon purchased some Qlobo and gave it to his customers who were unanimously of the opinion that it was the finest they had ever tasted. He now employs twenty-eight hands, and has built an elegant store, over which you can read the following sign: As you pass by, my gentle friend, No matter what you're doing, . Jut step inside to nave a treat, And buy some Globe for chewing. A few days ago a robust looking individ ual entered the store of the Walker, McGraw Company on Atwater St., and was Intro duced to Mr. Saxton and Mr. Elliott, who were, of course, pleased to see one of their beMt customers. Mr. Elliott shook hands very warmly but, having two thousand boxes of Globe Fine Cut to ship before four (it wasthn more than half-past three) begged to be excused, and sat down in his chair with the usual , bump, aa though he wm trying to have revenge either on his paoU or the leather covering of his easy chair. Mr. Saxton gave Sol one of those mercantile a gency-ui rectory -looks, as if he were say lng (in his mind) "credit good." "Un doubted credit." "Refer to office," or "good for any amount4" as the case may be. After congratulating Sol on hia success they all weut round to the " Elk " dining rooms, and, after an elegant repast, Sol invested five thousand dollars in Glole Tobacco and went on his way rejoicing. And now for the moral of the story : Men generally buy a worthless lot of articles that bring no profit as they command no sale. It Is the opinion of all that the Walker. McGraw Company keep the finest tobacco in the world and you will be doing your family an injustice not to pro cure some at once. I AN ACROSTIC. Go wher you will Around tht CLt, '. .
