It was posted, brined a semicircle, and ! lapping aronnd as if to inclose the Tunnel LIill. Y hen on Sherman's right you were west of Tnnnel Hill. "When you were on Sherman's left, you were east of the hill. The center was so thrown out and retired that, like tho wings it remained at a respectful dis tance -from the enemy who formed the centre, while Sherman formed the arc of the circle. It will be readily under stood from this that making separate Attacks from his right and left, Gen. Sherman aj proathed the rebel position on different sides ef the hill. So far separated were the columns that tho hill prevented them from seeing eftch other's movements. They were hence uuablo to act in concert a fact which may have had something to do with the result of tho attacks. The first attack was mado by the brigades of Generals John W. Corse and Col. Jones, 4th Virginia, from ti e left of the line. The movement began at eleven o'clock in the morning and the assault lasted only ten minutes. No sooner had our men appeared ou the top of the hill than they re ceived with a tretnenduous volley of musketry. But nevertheless they ad vanced rapidlj', charging a rifle-pit of the enemy , and after a baud to hand conflict retired in somo disorder, leav ing their dead and woundel inside the enemy's outer work. Brc it must not be supposed that our ineu fled to the foot of the hill. tTo sooner had they reached the protecting slope of the hill which hid them from the view of the enemy, than they reformed in good atyle and laid down under the Lrow of the hill to await an attack in return. But the enemy did not dare to attack, but contented himself with the repulse .he had succeeded in at quite heavy ost to both parties. The two bri gades remained quiet for some time. At half past eleven Gen. Giles Smith, with his brigade, among which is the 57th Ohio infantry, went to tho assis tance of Gen. Corse, and after a short delay, the wholo proceeded to make A SECOND ATTACK. This attack did not differ from the first in movement or result, but it was more desperate and was persisted in much longer, the final retirement of our men not taking place until half-past twelve, an hour having thus been con sumed in tho assault. There have been but few more desperate encounters in the war, than was this engagement of an hour, and it speaks volumes in praise of the men engaged, that, at its end, though much broken, they rallied at the slope of the hill and held the posi tion gained. The rebel fire was very heavy. They brought several pieces of light artillery to bear on our men, and poured into them incessantly a stream of grape and canister that did great execution-. Generals Corse and Giles Smith were severely wounded in this charge, and Col. Walcot, of the 46th Ohio, took command of the troops. In this assault the 37th Ohio and 6th Iowa suffered very severely, losing many valuable men and officers. While this was going on the left, a force of QMi brigade from the right of Gen. Sh jpan'8 line advanced to the attack on"the westeru side of the hill. They met with some decided opposition at the foot of the hill, from a force posted behind tho railroad bank, but dislodged them by an admirably exe cuted movement. They then began to ascend the hill, and marched up, under heavy fire, to a point over half way to the summit, where an abrupt ledge of rocks protected them. litre they baited to rest, hut they were not al lowed much of this, as tho rebels be gun, not only to fire upon them, but, fiuding the ledge of rocks too great a protection, they threw huge stones dowu the hill, and thus upon tlie men. About ten minutes past one a second brigade (Mathias') moved up the hill, aud formed under a heavy fire, in the Tear and on the left of the first brigade. Here this also halted, but, like the first, was not permitted to rest. Indeed, about this time the first brigade, Col. Loomis, unable to bear the attack of stones neaped upon them, rose from its position and advanced, but to receive 6uch a heavy fire that after a moment the line wavered and broke, falling back rapidly and in considerable dis order. But no sooner had it met, in descending the hill, the ascending bri gade, than the men rallied as if by magic, and moved up the hill again iu admirable good order, and upon a line with the other troops. These also ad vanced to the protecting ledgo of rocks before mentioned, and here the whole force laid down as before. It was r.early two o'clock when it was discovered thaC a third brigade Kanne'6 was moving up thb hill to the assistance of the other troops. This brigade formed on the left and rear of tbe two others. It was evidently in tended, at first, to form line of battle, echelon on the right, but tho circum stance of the falliug back of the first brigade, prevented the carrying out of this intention. This whole force was soon "in readiness and moved to the at tack. But the enemy had not been idle. Seeing tho heavy preparations making f r tbe assault, he was forced to mass his troops upon his right. It now ap pears that he marched them down the west slope of the ridge, and formed a line of battle at right angles to that of our forces. It was at tho very moment our troops, elated with the chances of success now presented to them, were moving forward to tho attack, aud had reached to within twenty-five yards of the enemy's fort, i hat this flanking force appeared around the spur of the hill, and began to pour in upon our right flank a most treraeudous fire. Our foroes attempted to change front, but it was to late. After a short and des perate, but ineffectual effort, the line wavered, broke, and retreated in dis order, The enemy pursuing some por tions of our troops who fled in tho di rection in which lay the brigade which had made the first assault, came upon that brigade, and after a few minutes fighting were repulsed and pushed into their works. Gen. Sherman sent Col. Walcot word to entrench himself, and thus ended the assaults by Gen. Shcr mm TUB ATTACK 15Y THK CENTER. In massing on the right to oppose Sherman the enemy had been com pelled to make the error of the day, and which was to ruin them. Gen. Grant, standing on Bald Knob, plainly saw their movements to the right, and felt that the movement to strike had come, anticipating as a result of Sher man's presistent efforts, this massing of Bragg's forces on tho right, Grant had formed in the valley on either side of Bald Knob two strong storming j parties. The right one was under the! immediate command of Gen. Palmer i and consisted of tho division of Gen. I Sheridan and the two brigades of Gen. ! Johnston, uot hitherto engaged. On the left the sterming party consisted of Gen. Baird and Wood's divisions, un der the immediate command of Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. These had been lying for some hours awaiting the word of attack. It was three o'clock whn Gen. Grant pronounced that word, and in five minutes after, the two graud columns moved gradually to tho attack. They were ordered to strike the mountain at poiuts about a mile apart, and to make the ascent as rapidly as was consistent with good order. Im mediately on reaching tho summit, the two forts were taken possession of and held. The enemy was encountered in con siderable force in his rifl-pits at the foot of the mountain, but after a weak resistance, the rebels turned and fired, endeavoring to reach the summit of the hill. In this few were successful. Many laid down in the trenches and surrendered, while many others were shot down as they ran up the hill. Our men pushed on, without halting, through the deserted rebel camps, and began the steep and difficult ascent of the jidge. It was now that the weakness of the rebels in the center displayed itself. The line of musketry fire was not heavy : and it was soon seen that they had but few supports for their artillery. General Grant soon saw that this was composed of numerous pieces, for from every point along the ridge they belched forth grape and canister at the heavy columns, now so rapidly advanc ing. But this did not serve to 6tay the fresh, eager men, who had Chicka mauga io revenge. Upon the hill there stood the fifty guns they had lost at Chickamanga, and interest on them of twelve pieces more : As if inspired with strength and vigor the HHrO pushed forward, each striving with tho other as to who should reach the sum mit first. This rivalry extended to regiments, brigades, divisions. It has become a question which will never be settled. It is enough that they reached the summit, and they secured sixty two iron and brass and brass and steel proofs of that fact. Gen. Turchin's brigade, of Bird's division, on reaching the summit imme diately proceeded to occupy the center fort, while one of Gen. Palmer's divi sions secured the one on the rebel left. Gen. Turchin had not yet gotteu his entire brigade into the work, before he was attacked most furiously by the enemy. He hastily pushed forward the rest of his regiments, to the sup port of those engaged with an over whelming force, for the enemy, finding us in possession of the ridge, made a desperate effort to recover from his disaster, and charged Turchin with all fhe force he had to spare from Sher man's front. But no sooner bad the reinforcements of Turchin gotten into position, than the rebels, recognizing that all was lost, turned and fled down tbe mountain, seeking safety in dis ordered flight. The Ufittle was over and at 5 p. m., 'on Wednesday night. Thus ended in a magnificent feat of arms, a series of as brilliant operations as this war has yet witnessed. The re sult to us can hardly be calculated. The siege of an important stronghold has been raised by the almost complete destruction of the besiegeing force. The enemy in our immediate front driven to seek safety in flight, the rear of the no less dangerous enemy in front of Gen. Burnside is so exposed that he can only protect himself by retiring. Already the telegraph inform? us that he is retreating to Dalton. Ti;e ene my who but yesterday was offensive has now been forced to take the defen sive. Our communications are intact, and last, but not least, our army has been enabled to push forward, and will doubtless soon strike the flying foe. Our losses are estimated at 600 killed and 2,500 wounded. We have lost no prisoners. Tho losses of tho enemy have been mentioned at 2,000 killed and wounded, and 7,000 prisoners. Gen. Grant's latest dispatch says we have taken sixty-two pieces of artillery. We have received, and published below a number of casualties in Ohio, Indiana and other Western regiments. We are daily expecting from our cor respondents full lists of the killed and wounded in the remarkable battles of CLickamauga. The War in Tennessee. Washington, Dec. 7.

President Lincoln's M essage, December 1st, 1&62. From Washington President's Procla mation. President Lincoln has issued a proc lamation extending a free pardon to all residents of the insurgent; States, ex cept those who have been civil or de plomatio agents of the so-called Con federacy ; those who have left judicial stations under the United States, or who have been officers in the rebel army with tho rank of Colonel or in the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant, upon condition that they take and keep inviolate an oath, which binds them henceforth to support and maintain the Constitution of the United States, and support all acts of Cougress passed during the rebellion and all proclama tions of the President during the same time. The Message, The President's message was proWa bly sent in yesterday (Wednesday.) It discusses mainly the quesitons of slavery, reconstruction, military and naval movements, and the progress of the war. The President holds that by virtue of his Proclamation Slavery is Dead in all but the excepted States. He recounts our victories, and dwells upon the present hopeful aspect of the war. We shall publish it in full in our next. " lii am The Organization of Congress, The 2Sth Congress convened at noon on the 7th. Tho Senate was called to order by. the Vice-President. The cre dentials of iho members from West Virginia, and of Senator Conncse, of Cal., and Henderson of Mo., were pre sented. Mr. Lane, of Indiana, gave notice of the introduction of bills to repeal the $300 conscription feature of the En rollment Act, and to increase the pay of non commissioned officers and pri vates in the army fifty per cent. The daily hour of meeting is fixed at 2 o'clock. In the House considerable difficulty was apprehended, from the threatened refusal of Mr. Etheridge, the old Clerk of the House, to recognize as bona fide members those w'ho have failed to pre viously present their credentials in due form, but thanks to his timidity rather than to any lack of dishonest efforts. He went just far enough to demon strate his capacity for high handed outrages, but got frightened and stop ped befoie going far enough to realize any benefit from it. After considerable discussion in ref erence to the matter, the certificates of the members whose names were left off the roll, were read and the names or dered to be put on. In his anxiety to defeat the organization of the House, this model Clerk, who was elected by Republicans for his patriotic services, had omitted names of all members from Maryland, Virginia, West Vir ginia, Kansas and Oregon, all from Missouri, save two copperheads, and had put on the names of three bogus members from Louisiana. But to his dismay, quite a number of Democrats, disgusted with the barefaced fraud, voted for the resolution requiring Etheridge to put tbe names on, while others refused to vote against it ; so it was carried by twenty odd majority, and the five Maryland men, four of them Administration men, were put on the roll. Tho House then proceeded to the election of speaker with the following rcsnlt. Whole number of votes, .... 181 Necessary to choice, 82 Colfax - - - - 101 Stebbins, , - - - 8 Cox, 42 King, 4 Dawson, - - - - 12 Blair, 2 Maltory, - - - - 10 Stiles, 1 The Clerk declared Speaker Colfax, of Indiana, duly and legally elected. The announcement was greeted with vociferous applause. Messrs. Dawson and Cox were ap pointed a committee to conduct the Speaker to the chair. Tho Speaker, on taking the chair, delivered a brief eloquent and patriotic address, which was received with general applause. On Tuesday, the organization of the House was completed by the election of Mr. McPherson, of Pa., Clerk ; Mr. Goodnow, Doorkeeper ; Mr. Ordway, Sergeant-at-arms; and Mr. King, of Minnesota, Postmaster. Both Houses are now ready for business-. S'The Richmond Enquirer has a j report that General Jo. Johnson has ! been assigned to the command of Bi -agg'sarmy, Hardee being only in tem porary command. From the Army ol the Potomac, The brief campaign of the Army of tho Potomac is over. Having success fully crossed tho Rapidan, driven Lee back upon the Orange and Alexandria road, fought ono brisk battle on our left wing, and noarly used up their lim ited supply of rations and forage, a counsel of war was held, to which it wascoucluded that a return to the old camping-ground was dictated by every aspect of the ca6c. The main reason for this course are these: Short rations and difficulty of bringing up more; the enemy strongly intrenched in a positi on which could not be carried in any svent without great loss; evry cold weather, making it certain that our wounded, in case of assault, would suf fer and diejby hundreds before they could be cared for. These faets led to the order for retreat. There was no fighting not even a skirmish; and the entire army recrossed the river with all its transportation intact. Tho entire loss of the campaign is 600 killed, wounded, andmissing, of whom 60 only were killed. The railroad and telegraph is in orderfrom Washington to Rap pahannock Station. Special Dispatch to the N. T. TrVrae. The Siege of Knoxville. General Attack on Sunday Night. Impetuous Assault on Fort Saun ders on Monday Morning. The reb el Column Broken in Fragments and Scattered. They leave Over One Hundred Dead on the Field. Burn side Grants a Truce to the Bebel to Bury their Bead. Knoxville, Monday, Nov. 30. 1868. During Saturday night Nov. 28, the enemy made a general attack in force ou a large portion of onr skirmishing line, and about midnight succeeded in driving in our pickets. This was in tended as a feint to confuse us and con ceal the real point of the contemplated assault. Cannonading and skirmishing continued all night. Early in tho morning the enemy charged in strong force Gen. Ferrier's position, Fort Saunders. They were met midway by a murderous discharge of grape and cauistcr and the steady fire of the rifle-pits, onder which they faltered and finally fell back in broken fragments, leaving two colonels, sever al captains, and iu all over ono hund red dead on the field. A considerable force reached the foot of the parapets, only to tumble into a ten feet ditch surrounding the fort, where the wound ed and dead and living were piled in an nndistinguishable mass. We cap tured 234 prisoners. The enemy's loss is not far from 700 in the assault; the Union loss less than 25. Gen. Burnside humanely offered o truce to Gen. Longstreet until 5 p. m. to afford time for the removal of the enemy's wounded and burial of the dead, which was agreed to, and alter ward extended two hours. The wound ed were brought into our hospitals and conveyed on our arabnhnces to the enemy's line. Threo stand of colors were captured. This (Monday) morn ing it is clear and freezing weather, with quiet around the line. Mansfield's Dispensatory 6ays that most of the Sarsaparilla of the shops is inert and worthless. Dr. Ayer in his writings on this drug states that not only is it inert as found in the shops, but so also aro most of the pre parations from it, or bearing its name. He shows, however, that this fact arises from the use of worthless varieties, or unskilful preparations by incomp etent men; that tho true Medicinal Sar saparilla (Tarza Smilax off.) of the tropics, when freshly gathered in the bud, is one of the most effectual altera lives we possess. Combined with other substances of great alterative however, like Iodine, Stillingia, Dock, &c, it makes Ayer's Comp. Ext. of Sarsp., which we have reason to believe is one of tho most effectual remedies for humors, 6kin diseases and for purifying the blood which has ever yet been for nd by anybody. Bangor (Me.)

OFFICIAL. Executive Mansion, ) Washington, Dec. 7. 1863. J Ke'iablc information having been re ceived, that the insurgent force is re treating from East Tennessee, under circumstances rendering it probable that the Union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important posi tion : and esteeming this to bo of high national consequence, I reccommend that all loyal people do, on receipt of this information, assemble at their places of worship, and render special homage to Almighty God, for this great advancement of the national cause. (Signed) A. Lincoln. From the Army ol the Potomac "Washington, Dec. 6. The Times'' special say6 : Rumors from the front to-night say that Lee's whole army is on this side of the Rapidan. It is also believed that ho has been reinforced of Longstreet's corps. The impression prevails, notwith standing Bemi-official denials, that our army will winter on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, some distance this side of the Rappahannock. The reward for the apprehen sion and delivery of the rebel John H. Morgan, has becu increased to $5,000, by the authority of the Governor of Ohio. BgPTbe arrest of Major General French, of the Army of the Potomac, on a charge of grave misconduct du ring the late movement south ol' tho Rapidan, is a'siieucca How John Morgan Escaped. A Columbus paper says that Col. Diok j Morgan, and the six Captains who were j confilned in the lower ranges of cells, I had, by menas of two small knives, dug ; through the floor of their cells, which lis composed of cement and nine inches i of brick-work. Underneath the cells is an air chamber, extending the whole length of the building. Of this fact jthe prisoners seem to have been ' aware. Once in the air-chamber, one ! of them could crawl to its termious and dig down in the soft earth with their knives until the bottom of the foundation of the wall was reached; then, digging out under,the thing was completed. Meanwhile, ropes had been manfactured of the bed-ticking, and all arrangements were complete for their final escape Everything being ip read iness only a little strategy was neces sary for tho escape of Gen. Morgan. He occupied a cell ou the second range just over the one occupied by his broth er Dick. On Friday evening, as the prisoners were being locked up for the night, the Morgans were allowed to exchange cells with each other. After Dick had seen everything prepared, he permittod bis brother John to take his place. Some time during tho night the prisoners crawled through the hole they had dug under the wall, but had skillfully con cealed, taking their rope with them. They escaped from the prison imme diate between the main building and the female department. Once in the yard, and their escape was compara tively easy. They went to the outer wall, near tho big gate, and threw their rope over the top, where it secured it self on one of the spikes. On this rope, and by the aid of some timbers near at hand, they clambered to the top, and easily descended on tbe outside. There are no guards on the onter walls after a certain hour. Tbe prisoners were dressed in citizens' clothes and not in prison habiiments. Capt. Hines, who is a ma6on and bricklayer, seems to have had charge of the work which resulted in the escape of the prisoners. A note was lefr for the Warden of the prrison, of which tho following is -a copy: "Castle Mkrion, Cell. No. 20, Nov. 27th, 1863. Comenccment. Nov. 4th, 1863. Conclusion, Nov. 20th, 1863.

The Philadelphia North American gives some excellent advice to those who wish to invest money. It is well for all those who are in funds to heed the counsel: "Though money has been temporarily scarce, capital con tinnes abundant; and the recent tum ble in the stock market has brought capitalists to a realizing sense of the unreliable character of many of tbe se euiities dealt in. It is greatly to the credit of the Government that its loans, of all the securities daily dealt in on the market, have maintained their integrity of price better than almost anything else. Its Five-Twenty year six per cent, loan, tbe interest on which is promptly paid in gold, has been sub scribed to, all through the pressure of the money market, at an average of more than two millions per day. And what is not the least gratifying fact in connection with the daily large sub scriptions to this popular loan, scarcely any of it is returned to the market for sale. It is taken for investment, and is held with unfaltering confidence in its reliability. And why should it not be ? It is seen that the Government now, after two years of tbe most gigantic war that tbe world has ever known, experiences no difficulty in command ing the necessary means to prosecute it, or in paying regularly the interest in gold as it falls due. If this caa be done while the war is being waged, who can anticipate any difficulty in readily accomplishing it when the war is ended? What better investment then, for capital, than the " Five Twenty" Government loan ? But if any doubt, let him refer to the statistics furnished by tbe census tables of the various nations of the world. Tho facts which they present will prove the most satisfactory mode of dispelling the'numberless gloomy apprehensions which are being continually conjured up by those who are disposed to exag gerate the extent of tbe calamity oc casioned Ly our rebellion. A reference to the state of most of the prosperous nations of the old world clearly dis proves such a position, and 6hows that tbe highest conditions of national ad vancement have uot been materially affected by the extended wars in which those nations have been immemmofial- ly engaged, and that a heavy national indebtedness has not proved an unmiti gated evil. "For instance, Great Britain, France and the Nertherlands will undoubtly be conceded to represent the highest prosperity that has been attained by any of the European nations. And yet no nations have been called upon to endure fiercer or more prolonged wars, domestic and foreign, than they. The effect has been, unquestionably, to in cur an enormous national indebtedness; but neither their wars nor their indebted ness have had the effect to destroy their elasticity, nor to check the prog ress of their general prosper ty. The result would have been different, proba bly, if these nations had been falling into decay, instead of being, as they really were, in a state of development ; and in this respect their case resembles our own, with enormous advantages in our favor. These nations, while under going the trials of war, were oppressed by tbe evils of an immenso exodus of their people, caused by the density of their population, the impossibility to pro vide occupation for them, the low price of labor, and the scarcity of territory. Compared with our own country, they possessed slight room for future devel opment; they were) settled iu every part, and no vast territory lay invit ingly open to encourage enterprise and settlement. Their great problem has ever been what to do with their surplue population, which, in its turn, has sought new fields for adventure and self-suport in countries like our own, where mi illimitable territory waits te be developed, and where incalculable resources invite industry snd energy. The encouragement to be derived from those facts and comparisons of circum stances is very great, and to the mind of any dispassionate reasoner is con clusive that the course of this great country is onward and upward, and that its credit will live unimpaired to the end."
