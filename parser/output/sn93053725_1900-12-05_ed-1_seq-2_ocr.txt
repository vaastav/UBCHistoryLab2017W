The president's- message has been discussed more or less by newspapers, politicians and people generally, and the verdict1 reached in most cases is that .the paper was. too lengthy. It said a good deal without saying much. If it could only be published as a ser ial the people who have not read it could then have a chance to do so, a little at a time. The Jackson Democratic association of Washington Is arranging' for its annual celebration of Jackson day, January 8th next, with as much en thusiasm as its members could pos sibly have displayed had the party- been victors in the late campaign. The Jacksonians are of the same undaunt ed brand as was '"Old Hickory" him self, and the result. of the-campaign- cuts iro figure in their calculations when compared with the principles they value far more than triumph. The amusement committee in Hart ford refused to grant Manager Par fcoiH, his regular monthly license the tirrt of December and as a consequence i . .V the manager is running his house with out a license - since that time. The committee has brought suit .again; tile manager. Some of tlie Hartford papers are unkind enough to say that the cause of the trouble is because Manager Parsons cut oil' seme of the free tickets former! v iriveii to the mem- . r - . - bers of the amusement committee. The affair promises to make a radical change in the manner of granting amusement licenses In : the Capitol city. .The sensational stories printed in seme of -the state papers about the Rev Father Slocum's sermon last Sun day are so absurd and ridiculous that a denial of them seems unnecessary. It only goes to show that some of the men who follow the profession in Wa terbury are just as yellow as the. New York Journal's Kid. Father Slocum's discourse was highly edifying, as all his sermons are. Not even once did he mention th? name Tammany, neither did he even hint at the organization. The men who are leading the reform crusade in New York and elsewhere had better, while they ar? about it. get after the newspapers that will delib erately libil a man who is doing his duty as he s:es it. Father Slociim needs no champion in the -Democrat. He is well able to fight- his own bat tles, and it would be well for thos? persons who are constantly distorting and twisting his sermons to beware. In ail probability the newsgatherer that seat out the story never heard the reverend gentleman preach any sermon much less the one iu -question. , The trust magnates are riding high Ijorses just at present, and if .the people-, are' not made to. realize this fact moje thoroughly than ever duriujhe next few Jears it will not 1; the fault cf tlie great mcnopolies.- , One writer says that whilst the coal: trust, 4he beef trust and other trusts aru; robbing the wage worker" in' his character -' of consumer.', still other trusts" are . plun dering him in -;hls -'clja.racteL-;gf . pro ducer. He is ground between." the up per and nether stones 6rreducedvages and increased cost of t evBiythihg he and his family have to use. In this way "the -full dinner pall'' which played so prominent a part in the re cent election is growing beautifully less; It is only about a month since William McKinley was re-jeleeted, aud already the. trusts, t which gave him such financial "support! are' beginning to turn the screws. ,sThe steel trust, known na the Rational Steel company, of Mighon Junction, O., leads the way by a sweeping redtiction 'of 33 per cent and, anticipating trouble', is converting its works into a sort of a. fortification. A special dispatch to the New York World thus refers ;to these prepara tions: ,; "The" conipaiiy has made pre cisely the preparations Carnegie made. Theplant Is" inclosed iy' a high fence, surmounted By barbed wires "and elec tric wires?, except 'here.-an .entrance is' left at the ri ver and where the rail-. roads pass throngh.

Few events iu the official life--of our present executive have given him such genuine pleasure "As this graduation. Miss Grace stood at the head of her class, while her recod, during the en tire course, had been one of praise worth endeavor. The president.' to show his appreciation of -her success, bestowed vm an. niece- a oeuuu ful diamond pin. ' The: gradua tion dress, a dainty creation of white chiffon and lace, was' Mrs McKinley's gift. It was made at the white house, under the personal supervision of its gentle mistress. It . was after this great event that the president offered to adopt Miss Grace, formally, and thus make her the reigning belle of the nation. the social leader of the capital, the only young girl ill the great pres idential niansion.at Washington. This was surely a tempting offer, but It did not swerve this beautiful and brilliant girl from a long cherished -aspiration. She wished to use her gifts in a tit tfiig way. in one to which she had endeavored to train herself during her long and severe probation at Mount Holyoke. She chose the arduous pro fession of a school teaoher, and this -falfc on her own application, sustained by her record at college, .she secured .a position in theliigh school of Mid dletown. Conn.
