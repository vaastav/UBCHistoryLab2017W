The President's message does not men tion Hearttt aud Bryan by name, but the demagogue politics he denounces is easily identified with those partners. Possnu.Y the woman who wrote the book thought that marriags on probation would be an improvement over the pres eut plan of marriage on suspicion. A mono the 0000 Americana on the Isth mus not a death occurred during the pant three months. The sanitation enforced by the United States in tropical regions under its coutrol is a marked success. "It Is not wise," says the President in the message, "that the nation should alienate Its remaining coal lands." The trusts so eager to complete their monopo ly bare struck a snng in this new form of government reservation. Wildcat mining stock Is being sold to the easy marks. About once in live years a new harvest of this kind is reaped by various kinds of confidence men, and the Fiauklin News has figured out that this is the appointed year. No knii of the unprecedented prosperi ty is seen by the President unless there is "reckless speculation and disregard of legitimate business methods on the part of the business world." In a word, busi ness will be good if business men, along with their energy and enterprise, are upright and prudent. The Legislature at the coming session will be asked to pass a law forbidding any unnaturalized resident of Pennsyl vania to possess a gun or other firearms. The bill is being prepaied by Joseph Kalbfus, secretary of the State Game Commission. Duiing the bunting season which closed last Friday four game war dens were murdered in this state, seven were shot and the killing of two was at tempted by foreigners. Congressman Smith, of Puuxsutaw ney, who did not ask to be re-elected, says Uncle Joe Cannon will easily be re elected to the Speakership of the Sixtieth Congress. He is an excellent presiding officer, and betides he has a lot of good committee places to give out. The old members who were re-elected, and most of them were, are already getting matters fixed for themselves, so that when the new Congress meets the new members will be entirely welcome to what there is left. A treaty is in process of negotiation between the United States and Japan which It is thought will be acceptable both to the Japanese authorities and to the people of San Francisco. It isbelieved by many that the strongly conciliatory language used by the President toward Japau and the Bcolding he gave San Francisco was part of his scheme of di plomacy to get the matter adjusted with out a serious rupture. Japan'a represen tatives appear to take a rational view of the situation and manifest a willingness to do anything within reasoo to facilitate the conclusion of a treaty that will relieve the stress on both sides. Punxsutawney Spirit. Referring to the project to provide for the publication of the laws of the Commonwealth, the Norristown Herald illustrates its points by citing the act of April 20, 1005, which makes it unlawful to throw waste paper, sweepings, ashes, household waste, nails or rubbish of any kind into any city, borough or township street, and inquires: "How many pepole of Norristown actually know that If they throw a piece of paper upon the streets of the borough they are breaking a statute and are making themselves liable to ar ras taud perchance imprisonmentthereby? How many fishermen or hunters are fully aware ol all the restrictions which the law has imposed? It hazards the opinion that "the game and fish wardens would have much less revenue if honest citizens were kept posted by a general publication of laws." It mnst be conceded by every philo sophic and unprejudiced observer that nothing that President Roosevelt can do will serve to abate or lessen bis dignity in the eyes of the people, says the New York Sun. It is the most inscrutable and wonderful of his many gifts. Before it the power and the right of impeach ment have become an obsolute tradition. He can no more make himself ridiculous than the Senate cau resuscitate the pas sions with which it assailed Andrew Johnson. Not since the great figure that held the whole stsge ot Europe a hun dred years ago has there been another in history so magically endowed. There is no mystery iu all humanity like the mys tery of genius. Therefore, all criticism is futile, and only aciu iescence is the safer and wiser part. It is unprofitable, if not indeed abject folly, to urge that while the President cannot make himself ridiculous it is possible that he should make the country ridiculous. It is the same Providfcnce that watches over both. Expenses of Candidates. Edwin S. Stuart, the successful Repub lican candidate for Governor at the re cent election, expended (6,1'J1.9 in his campaign. Mr. Stuart filed a statement in the office of the Secretary of the Com monwealth last week which shows that ha contributed $5,000 to the Republican State Committee. The balance ol his ex penditures were for car fare, clerical ser vices and othor personal expenses, Robert K. Young, the successful Re publican candidate for Auditor General, expended t?S8, of which (.00 was a con tribution to the Ropiiblican State Com mittee. Lowis Emory, Jr., spent $25,661.40 in his campaign for Governor on the fusion ticket, as shown by his statement filed. The Lincoln Party Committee got 18,000; the Democratic State Commil'.eo, (5,000; the Pittsburg Lincoln Committee, $1,500, and his personal expenses were (11,770. W. D. Shields, the successful candidate for Assembly in Forest county, has filed his account at the court house here, and swears to an expense nf$o(0,21, divided as follows: Printing, (70 M); hotel bill $106.88; liyery bills, (182.45; transport tion of voters, (115 88; telephone ftt.fiO; making poll book, fii.OO.

HANDEL'S OBSTINACY. An Incident of the Greet Maslplnn'a 1'hlldhcod Darn. A child's obstliincy dors not always bring ns fortunate results as wits the case with Handel, the great musician, lii extraordinary resoluteness us a boy doubtless led to that great success which crowned the later years of liis life. When he was some seven years of ago his f.sUier had occasion to visit ft son by a former wife, who was valet to the Duke of Suxe Weissenfela. Traveling in those days 200 years ago was tedious and expensive, and Dr. Handel did not de?lre to be delayed with the care of nu "Infant" during a Journey which the demands of a tq- sponsible profession would probably make as short as possible. Rut the future giant of music would go. He cried, bellowed nnd eventually rau nlong the road after the vehicle, until the tender feelings of the doctor could refuse no longer. In an evil mo ment for his jurisprudence scheme he took the child with him. Xo sooner did the little fellow reach the ducal residence than lie gave rein to his fancy on the keys of every in strument that he found open. The re markable music that came from the finger tlp.T of the i-hild's hands was soou the object of wonder and conver sation throughout the palace, and all this was intensified when he Recured an opportunity of touching the keys of the chancel organ within the hearing of the duke. Such a throb started from that chap el organ when little Handel's tendriled fingers chose the keys, and the soul of the duke was touched as It never had been touched before truly n momen tous occurrence, since but for It Han del's sacred music might never have bceu written. The duke's attention having been ar rested, he Inquired of Dr. Handel con cerning the child's future, nnd eventu ally succeeded In placing linn for three years' study under Zacbau, the organ ist of Hallo cathedral. This was the be ginning of II;ndei's musical education. The Poison of AVcnlth. Great riches, currying with them enormous possibilities of self Indul gence, may fairly be' considered as a sort of poison which ruins a certain proportion of those who are exposed to it, though strong constitutions sur vive. As rum destroys savages, 60 wealth tends to destroy persons espe cially young ones, whom use and train ing have not gradually made Immune to -Its effects. How that is may readily lie noticed in observing the effects of newly won wealth on the families of the winners. It Is a rare man and usu ally one very much blessed In his wife, who ran combine with the ability that wins hiin riches the sagacity to train children born In comparative poverty so that they will benefit by a rapid uud radical Improvement In his circum stances.

WHEN VACCINATION FAILS TO TAKE Health Commissioner Dixon Ex plains Provision That Is Made la Such Cases So That Children May Not Be Debarred From School WHEN CLAIM IS MADE THAT "CHILD IS UNFIT In Exceptional Cases, Where Careful Investigation By Local or State Health Authorities Justifies Admit' tion to School, It It Authorized, "After three carefully performed but unsuccessful attempts to vaccinate child have tailed, that child should not be debarred from school privileges, but should be admitted, and the Depart ment of Health has provided for this,' snld State Health Commissioner Sam' uel G Dixon In an Interview. "The Supreme Court ot Pennsylva nla." continued Dr. Dixon, "called at' ter.tlon In the recent opinion It banded down reaffirming the validity of the so railed vaccination law of June 18, 1895, to the hardship Involved In the twelfth section of that act when it is beyond the power of children of school age to be vaccinated, although they may Dot previously have had smallpox nor pre viously been vaccinated, and even re peated attempts to perform the oper ation upon such children are without effect and vaccination will not take. In such cases, as the court pointed out, the physician cannot certify that such child has been successfully vac cinated so as to meet the requirement of admission to school. The court's de cision suggested the possibility of the health authorities, state or local. mak ing a regulation setting forth the con ditlons under which a child upon whom vaccination will not take, may be per. mitted to go to school. The court also suggests that the health authoritlei would have to consider whether such a regulation would be undesirable as affording opportunity for the evasion of the statute. "The Department ot Health," con tinued Health Commissioner Dixon, "has taken this tendency to evade the law Into consideration, as It was obliged to, and yet we have endear- ored to nee that those children who could not be vaccinated should be ad' mitted to school. Our method of aO' complying this from the first has been as follows: "When the cases that we received Inquiry about were within the limits of a borough or city having a Board of Health of its own, we suggested that after two unsuccessful attempts to vac cinate a. child, the third attempt be made by or in the presence of the physician of the Board of Health. If this attempt failed, then the physician of the board, acting In his official ca pacity, should authorize the admission of the child. In the rural districts, where there are no Boards of Health to pass upon such cases, I have always asked that after three unsuccessful attempts to vaccinate a child have been made, the name of the child and the physician who made the attempts be referred Im mediately to the State Department of Health. The cases have then been at once Investigated by our County MedU cal Inspectors or some one deputized by them, so that the child might not unjustly be debarred from school privi leges. These methods of dealing with the situation have been In conformity with the Supreme Court's suggestion that the health authorities assume the responsibility of authorizing the ad mission to school of children upon whom, after a reasonable number of attempts, vaccination does not take. Taking advantage of the spirit of this part of the Supreme Court's opin ion, we have also endeavored to deal with the cases of children where there was reason to believe that the child's physical condition did not make vac cination at the present time advisable. The Attorney General of the State had given an opinion that a teacher was not authorized to accept a certificate from a physician stating that the child was not in a physical condition to be vaccinated. It is reasonable to be lieve, however, that although the sim ple giving of such a certificate by the family physician would not be suffi cient, the spirit of the Supreme Court's opinion would permit the recognized health authorities throughout the state, after careful Investigation, to pass upon such cases. Therefore when such cases are now brought to the attention of our depart ment, we have suggested that inside borough or city limits, the local Board of Health, through Its physician, de cide whether the child Is well enough to attend school and yet not in a fit condition to be vaccinated. In the dis tricts where there are no Boards of Health we are having such cases In vestlgated and passed upon by our regular County Medical Inspectors. 'It will thus be seen," concluded Dr. Dixon, "that the State Department of Health Is doing everything possible to prevent any child from being unjustly deprived of its schooling. If the par ent or guardian, however, refuses to permit a child to be vaccinated simply through prejudice, the health authori ties certainly have no power to Inter fere with the operation of the law. In such cases we have done everything we could to overcome this prejudice by education, so that the Innocent child might not be made to suffer be cause the parent desired to leave It exposed to the ravages of smallpox rather than undergo vaccination, which the Legislature of Pennsylvania, In the exercise of Its police power, has made one of the requisites of admission to school."

In the first months of the Rusaia-Japa war we had a striking example of the ne cessity for preparation and the early ad vantage of those who, so to speak, "have shingled their roofe in dry weather."
