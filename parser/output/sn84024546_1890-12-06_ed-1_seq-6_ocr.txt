"I think it safe to say that we'll set the fiew club organized on Mondaj" were tbe words of Manager Hanlon last evening, nt the close of the meeting of the local 1. L. stockholders. The meeting was held at the Hotel Duquesne, and lasted about two nonrs, and although every detail was not definitely settled, the business transacted warranted the assuring statement of Mr. Hanlon. Director H. B. Ilea was also extremely cheerful at the prospect, and said: "Every thing is in first-class shape. There are two stockholders yet to hejr from, Fred Carroll and one in the East. The latter, however, is willing to forfeit his stoct it he does not pay the 30 per cent assessment. However, we are all right." According to the opinion of the stock holders last evening no more meetings of the P. L. stockholders will be necessary, and the next meeting will be to organize the new club. At last evening's meeting the plan of dissolution sgreed to was for each stockholder to pay his share of the club's debts. This most assuredly is the best way, and one that will be in the long run the most harmonious. At any r.ite, it is less cnen to objections than any other. Satis factory arrangements will, at once, be made with tfce creditors and, as Manager Hanlon sid, the new club may be formed on Monday. Both parties are anxious to have the new club organized so that definite and safe action can be taken in the way of signing new plavers. Mr. Hanlon is exceedingly anxious on this point, as it is probable that after Monday clubs can commence signing players. On Mond.iv the Conference Com mittee is expected to meet in New York, and that body bus the power to tay that everything between the X. L. and 1. L is settled or declared off. In either event it is likely that permission will be given to clubs to sign player. In anticipation oi this Mr. Hanlon desires that the Pittsburg club be in a position to be in the field as soon as anybody eise. Of course, Mt. Hanlon is not yet elected manager, hut jt is certain that he will be, jadgiug from the general opinions of stocuholders. Mr. O'Xeill will be elected President of the club. The experiences gone through of ljtc will certainly cause lany man appointed to the office tobe very cautious and fair to everybodv concerned. The debts of the P. iu club amount lo 59.G90, and ah of this amount, except ?G00, is due one gentleman. He is interested in the club and has made very gcneious terms tif payment. IT

Killing GIVEN HIM-BT SECKfiTARI BLAINE. Official Uorrerpondence of the Cass Sent to Congress. NO EXCDSli FOE THE MISISTEU Washington, Dec. 5. The President to-day, transmitted to the House oE Repre sentatives the correspondence growing out of the killing of General Barrundia by Guatemalan officers on board the Pacific Mail steamer Acapulco in the port of San Jose. The correspondence was called for by resolution of September 21 last, declaring that Mr. Blair,?, in his letter laying the cor respondence te'ore the President, says: "It will be observed the last report of Minister Mizner contains matter essential to a full and accurate understanding of the case," and was dated September 23, and not re ceived at the department until October 9, several days after th: adjournment of Con gress. The correspondence consists often in cisures, the first of which was a telegram from Mr. Mizner to Mr. Blaine, dated August 28, and the last a letter from Mr. Blaine to Minister Mizner, dated Novem ber 18,aunouncing that he can see no justifi cation of Mr. Mizner's course, that this Government disavows his action, and di recting him to turn over the attain of the legation to Mr. ICimberly and return to the United States. Mizner's Side of It. In his telegram announcing General Bar ruudia's death, Mr. Mizuer says he had ad vised the steamship officers that be guaranteed General iJarrundia's personal safety, and that he had joined the United States Consul General in advising the Captain to permit the arrest, on the charge of being an enemy, martial law being in forge. Under the date of August 30, Act ing Secretary Wharton telegraphed Mizner regretting that he (the Miuister), had ad vised or consented to the surrender, as no specific charge of violation of the ordinary lawot Guatamala appeared. Minister Minner's first letter to Secretary Blaine with regard to the killing is dated August 29, and was received September 18. He relates the circumstances already stated and then quotes a communication to Cap tain Pitts.dated the lilth, stating that Guata mala, like any other nation, has the right to arrest a peison on a neutral ship in its waters in time of war for any cause deemed an offense under international law. The Order to Captain Pitts. In a later telegram to Captain Pitts, Min ister Mizner says: If your ship is' within one league of the terri tory of Qnatamala and you have on board Gen eral Barrundia it becomes your duty under the law of nations to deliver him to the authorities of Guatamala upon their demand. Allegations lutving been made to this legation that Bar rundia is hostile to, and an enemy to this He public, guarantres have been made to me by this Government that bis life shall not be in danger or any o';her punishment inflicted upon him other than for the causes charged. The allusions to Barrundia' personal salety, Mr. Mizner says, were at his request promised the night before by the President. Subsequently he received a telegram from Commander Keiter, ot the navy, acknowl edging Guatamala's right over the steamer, and requesting the Minister to obtain per mission irom the Government to return Bar rundia to Mexico in the Thetis. The Minis ter of Foreign Relations positively declined to accede to this, request. All the circumstances and Barrundia's well-kown hostility to the republic, aud his attempted invasion of Mexico,. Mr, Mizner says, decided his course, and hene-J cordingly, in response to a request for writ ten and not telegraphic orders, sent Captain Pitts a letter advising the Captain to sub mit to tbe arreat of bis passenger. The fol lowing day Commander Keiter telegraphed Barrundia's death while resisting arrest. Guatemala Beady to Fight. Under date of September 23, iu a letter from Mr. Mizner to Mr. Blaine, which was received October 9, and in which the Minis ter justified his course, he says he called on the 18th ou the Minister ot Foreign Rela tions .or an explanation of the affair. Iu this interview the Minister stated with em phasis that his Government had given posi tive orders to take Barrundia from the Acapulco even to sinking the ship, notwith standing it might have involved a conflict with our two war vessels. This, he said, would have been in the ex ercise of the undoubted right of his Govern ment over its own waters, in which he was confident the law of nations would hive sustained him. Mr. Mizuer says he had never heard of these orders before. He then gives the decision of Secretary Bayard in the Gomez, Mexican, case in support of his action, and concludes: "I confidently add that nothing will tend so much to the establishment of a permanent peace in these republics as a plain declaration that our fleet ot steamers cannot be used in local. waters as an asylum for revolutionists. Blaino Censures the Minister. The correspondence closes with a letter from Secretary Blaine, to Mr. Mizner, dated November 18th, in which he reviews the case at length iu all its bearings, and says that "the more the question is examined in the light of important facts, tardily dis closed, the deeper becomes the regret that you so far exceeded your legitimate author ity as to sign the paper, which in the hands of the officers of Guatemala became their warrant for the capture of General Barrun dia." The Secretary contends that the claim that the Government of Guatemala had ihe right to arrest B irrundta under its con tract with the Pacific Mail Steamship Com pany is untenable, and attacks each of the specific demands of Guatemala upon the representatives of the United States" in this case as improper and illegal. The case of Gomez, which Mizner offers as an excuse for his conduct, the Secretary dis cusses at length and fails to find in it any support of Mizner's action. Secretary Blaine then continues: Mizner Wholly to Blame. I am aware that it may be said that after all you merely advisod the Captain of his duty. lJut the Captain did not simply seek advice. In his telegram from Champcrico, be sass that op his arrival at Sau Jose he will place himself "under tbe orders of the American Minister." He again telegraphed to you later from Chaui jicricn that he was "awaiting yunr instruc tions," anil that at San Jose he expected "your written orders." In his last telegram to you. dispatphed from San Jose on arriving at that port on the evening of August 27, he cate gorically inquires: Shall I deliver General Barrundia to the authorities here7 If so, please send me a letter with yoursignature to that efTect." There is not hero the slightest suggestion that Captain Pitts proposed to act otherwise than by your orders, and under your lesponsi Uility. It was under these circumstances that you wrote the letter which became, lu tbe hands if a Guatemalan official, the pretext of the at tempted seizure of General Barrundia. The naval force of the United States in those waters thus became an acquiescent spectator of events, although a merchant vessel or the United States was then lying under the muzzles of guns manned by men who, as you state, you hart every reason to believe wero prepared to resort to any act of violence, even," as Scnor Anguiano has Blnce declared to you, "to sink the ship, notwithstanding it might' have iu. volved a conflict with our two vjar vessels then and there." Little Begard for Threats. I am not disposed to pay undue regard to these post facto threats, which" are now re ported to the department, I prefer to think that by extravagance of language, Uncontrolled by tbe actual presence of the problem which he was permitted to solve so much tn his satisfaction, Benor Anguiano has done this in justice to his own sense nf humanity. To have sunk the Acapulco, with her freight of Innocent lives. In the execution of a purpose for tbe accomplishment of which nothing but unlawful and Invalid excuses have so far been advanced, would have been an act of warfare, and of savage warfare. . Ana I am instructed by the President to say that he earnestly trusts the time will never come when the course of events in Guatamala or tbe declared purpose of her rulers will con strain this Government to insure the safety of its merchant vessels entering the waters of Guatamala, by stationing naval vessels along the coast and oppostte, the ports of that country. Secretary Blaine informs Mr. Mizner that if. instead of accepting the lawless and tur bulent condition of affairs as the ground of his advice and consent to the surrender of General -Barrundia, he had made it the basis of a suggestion to Commander Keiter to offer him hospitality on board of the Ranger, witnin or without the waters of Guatamala, and with or without the conseut of her government, his action would have bad the sanction of humane and recognized precedence. Invited to Come Home. Mr. Blaine closes his letter as follows: On more than one occasion this Government has permitted its legations and ships ot war to offer hospitality to political refugees. This is done from motives of human ity. Its views would not have been less pronounced if, in addition to tho humane aspect of tho subject, it had also been confronted with tbo duty of preventing tbe decks of its merchant vessels from being made the theater of illegal violence, upon groundless and unlawful excuses, and without even tho pretense of legal formality. For your course, therefore. In intervening to permit the authorities of Guatamala to ac complish their desire to capture Gen eral Barrundia, I can discover no justifica tion. You were promptly informed that your act was regretted. I am now directed by the President to inform you that It is disavowed, Tho President is moreover, of opinion that your usefulness in Central America is at an end. You will therefore leave vour post with all convenient dispatch, turning over your lega tion to Mr. Kimberly as charge d'affaires ad in teritn, through whom your letter of recall will subsequently be presented the Gautcraalan Government.
