Mrs. Maria N., wife of Josiah W. Gitt, of Hanover, Pa., died suddenly on Tuesday last, of apoplexy, aged 63 years. W. L. Crawford has erected a building on the Hanson Franklin property, near Taylors ville, and opened a general country store. During the revival services held in Cente nary M. E. Church, in this city, 54 persons have professed conversion. The meeting will be continued. Christmas shopping is in full blast. Large stocks, attractive prices and liberal advertis ing has brought crowds of people to West minster from every part of Carroll and seme from adjoining counties. Rev. S. D. Hall, rector of Christ P. E. Church, Denton, has decided to go to Sykes ville, and will remove there as soon as the opening of navigation makes convenient the transportation of his household goods. Mrs. Anna Mary Sellman, whose illness was chronicled in the Advocate several weeks ago, died at her residence at Warfields burg onThursday of last week. Her remains were interred at, Stone Chapel on Sunday morning. Do not throw coal ashes in the streets, nor allow any member of your family or employe to do so. They are not only blown into the doors and windows of your neighbors, and thus become an annoyance, but it is a finable offence under a city ordinance. Mr. John N. Lineweaver, a native of Manchester, this county, died in Baltimore last Sunday, in his 61st year. He had been a resident of-Baltimore for forty-two years, and for the past ten years in the wholesale liquor business, on North Paca street. There was a rumor in Westminster last Monday that Thomas Caltrider, who had been shot by Rezin B. F. Warehime, at Mechanics ville on Sunday, November 28, had died of his wounds. The report was entirely un founded, and Mr. Caltrider is doing well, with every prospect of speedy recovery. Last Saturday President Cleveland appoint ed two Appraisers of Customs at Baltimore, Messrs. B. F. Laurenson and Thaddeus S. Sbarretts. The former is father-in-law* of Mr. Thomas R. Myer, of this city, and the latter was recommended by the Advocate several months ago. Salary of each is $3,000 per year. To day closes the fifth week of Court, and yet the civil docket has scarcely been touched. If the business laid out for this term be all concluded, it will be the longest session ever known in the county. This week the Court has been a sort of criminal machine, with State’s Attorney Henning as chief engineer. The average convictions a day amount to four or five. The cold snap of last week formed ice about four inches thick, and on Saturday the ponds vwere covered with merry skaters. On Tues -day ice cutting began and good ice, about four .or five inches thick, has been housed. Snow Tell at intervals from Saturday night until 'Tuesday morning, and reached a depth of ; about five inches. Sleighing was indulged in for several days. Salem Lodge, I. 0. 0. F., this city, on Monday night last elected the following offi •cers: Paul Tingling, N. G.; Joseph Turfle, V. G.; H. B. Grammar, R. S.; John J. Reese, P. S.: F. A. Sharrer, Treas.; Dr. J. W.

Irwin celebrated ibe twentieth anniversary of their wedding, at their commodious residence on East Main street, this city, last Saturday evening. About seventy guests were present to tender their •congratulations and to enjoy the pleasant oc casion. An elegant supper and refreshments were served in excellent style by the Bruce Brothers, caterers. The bride and groom of twenty years ago were the recipient* of more than a hundred presents, consisting of china ware of all descriptions, handsome and use ful as well as ornamental. The damage to our press, which broke two •weeks ago and compelled us to avail ourselves of the courtesy of the Sentinel in working off our edition, was promptly and effectively re paired by Mr. John A. Shower, our skillful local machinist, at his establishment, corner of liberty and Green streets, this city. A printing press is a complicated piece of ma chinery, and it is not otten that others than those engaged in their manufacture, with the necessary facilities in a press factory, can re pair a break. We cordially recommend Mr. Shower to all who have need of his services. His shops are an invaluable addition to West* minster industries. The fall of snow has delayed the taking of photographs of buildings in Westminster, and this will necessarily delay the issuing of the Directory. The Directory will certainly con- ' tain cute of the Court House, Ascension Church, M. E. Church, M. P. Church, Odd Fellows’ Hall, Albaugh Building, Orndorff Building, Advocate Building, Mon tour House, Lutheran Church, Western Ma ryland College and Theological Seminary. It is desired to have St. John’s Church, St. Paul s And the Dunkard Church, and about four or five private residences, and several more business houses. The cuts wiU cost $9.00 •each, and those ’who are thinking over the matter will please decide to-day as it is de sired to have the photographs taken before more snow falls. Those wanting two cuts will get a reduction. By having a consider able number made, we hare been enabled to get them at a lower figure than first supposed, j 

PLEASANT VALLEY ITEMS. Improvements—Festival—Heavy Porkers. Emanuel Myers is erecting a handsome dwelling here, which, when completed, will add greatly to the appearance of our little village. Chas. D. Wanlz recently purchased a lotot land from Joseph Helwig, and is now engaged in building on it. Jeremiah Koontz has built a dwelling on the land purchased from Samuel Lawyer. Levi Myers, who recently purchased bis father’s property, has had extensive re pair* made to the dwelling, remodeled the t*able and put up new outbuildings. John Senft is erecting a furniture establishment, 20x30 feet, on the lot adjoining the church, here, he recently purchased from H. B. Al baugh. Joseph P. Tingling has commenced the foundation for a new store house, 20x35 feet. The ladies of St. Matthew’s Church will hold an oyster supper and festival in the base mentof the church, commencing on Tuesday night after Christmas, to be continued the balance of the week.

A fire of mysterious origin occurred in this city about 8 o’clock Wednesday night last, at the residence of Rev. Chas. A. Reid. Mrs. Nelson Mitten, a neighbor, detected smoke in her house, and in looking out for the cause *aw smoke issuing from the roof of Mr. Reid s house. The alarm of fire was quickly given, and soon the fire department was on hand. The family being at church, the house was .opened ;U)<l ike fire speedily extinguished. Tne fire only needed air to have done great damage. It originated in a bureau in a second etory back room, where there had not been a fire for more than year. The supposition is that a match must have been ignited by open ing or shutting a drawer, or by a mouse. Ihe report of a lamp exploding is incorrect, as there was none in the room at the time. Mr. Eeid’s loss is about $75 in furniture, carpets, bed and table linen and other contents of the bureau. A hole was burned m the floor and the wails damaged by water and smoke, Tbe building was insured m the Carroll county company, and Mr. E. Manning, the secretary nod treasurer, viewed the property on Thurs day morning and at once gave orders for re pairs. The repairs will not likely cost over $25. PATAPSOG ITEMS. Temperance Meeting-Large Hogs, &c. A temoerance meeting was held at the Pa tapsco M. E. Church on Saturday evening last, the object of which was to arouse * a temper ance sentiment in our neighborhood, ana to , obtain members and a charter for a division i of the Sons of Temperance at our place. Dr. Charles Billingalea, of Westminster, the G. . W. P., Wm. L. Whittington, of Anne Arun del county, and Rev. W. C. Babcock, were the speakers. The meeting was opened by singing and prayer, after which Dr. Billings lea was introduced. He said that the tem > perance issue was-at hand, and the time had | come in this country when every citizen of 1 both sexes was called upon to take sides. That there was no middle ground and should be no neutrality in the issue. The liquor men were organizing and holding secret sessions > and we must organize also in every district, town and hamlet, and be ready when the fight comes. And the best way to do it was to or ganize divisions of the Sons of Temperance all over the country. He appealed to the audience, which was large and respectable, to know upon which side of this great issue they would be found acting. He spoke of the origin of the Sons of Temperance and of the good effects of the society in moulding public sentiment. He spoke earnestly and laid a strong foundation for Mr. AV hittington, who followed in a forcible and truthful exposition of the evils of intemperance. He had come a long way for no other purpose than to try to show to his fellow man the evils of strong drink, and to recommend a remedy. The liquor traffic in this country was fraught with so much evil, and was the growing cause of so much misery that no human language could defend it and no conscientious man could sell it to his fellow-mau to ruin and de grade him. No drunkard can enter the king dom of Heaven, therefore it damns the soul. He said whiskey was made to support a class of lazy fellows (the liquor seller) who grow fat upon the hard earnings of the poor labor ing man. He drew a contrast between the boy sent to the store with twenty-five cents to buy sugar, muslin or stockings and thq one sent with the same amount to the rum shop to buy whiskey. In the one case the family had the benefit of the money. In the other it was worse than thrown away. It was use less, however, to waste time to prove the evils of strong drink, as every sensible person knew its tendency. And no person ever became better off by using alconolic drink, and no argument under heaven could be produced to prove it beneficial. How to cure it: The best way he thought was for the people to place themselves under some restraint or in some position wherein they could use an influence to improve public sentiment and thereby elevate the human family. He thought that the organization of , temperance societies throughout the country wherein the members thereof could hold stated meetings and inculcate a temperance senti ment would exert the greatest influence in that direction, and that a division of the Sons of Temperance in this neighborhood would be of great benefit, wherein the energies and influence of beautiful woman, conscientious men, and down to fourteen year old boys, could be enlisted in the cause. Rev. Bab cock closed the exercises in a few very ap propriate remarks. He showed that the great expenditure of money for intemperance even among the laboring classes, and the wage workers, bred most of the discontent now so rife in the country. After which several per sons gave their names as charter members of a temperance organization. Lewis Leppo killed two hogs which weighed 398 and 434 pounds; Salem Martin, one, 458, Mrs. Bolte, one, 291; Jno. Harman, two, 312, i 321; J. A. Bush, six, agregating 1196, and one weighing 328; David Abbott, three, 373, 419, 473: Nicholas Leppo, two, 170,180; Jno. Taylor of T., two, 280, 325; Wm. Taylor, two, 331, 356. Last Wednesday over 2600 pounds of pork were shipped from our station to Baltimore. Alesia Items. Edward Lucabaugh, who has been clerking with our merchant here for the past two years, is now confined to bed with rheuma tisra. While riding home in a buggy, and near their residence, on December 2d, Hon. S. H. Hoffacker and wife met with an accident by the breaking of a spindle. Their horse began to run, but Mr. Hoffacker succeeded in stop ping him, but not until a fence rail had made its way through the top of the buggy, just above the heads of the occupants. The buggy was a total wreck, but Mr. and Mrs. Hoffacker were uninjured. J. H. Blocker, our merchant, seems to be doing a thriving business this season in grain and general merchandise. Unless he gets help soon he will probably be laid up like his clerk. We learn that H. L. Fringer, of Arcadia, last week killed five hogs, fourteen months old, that weighed respectively 500, 4SZ, 480, 435 and 429; also five six months’ old pigs, weighing 182, 172, 170, 169, 162. I. M. Blocher, while driving a span of horses over a county road on Wednesday evening, had the misfortune to break a spindle. This end of Manchester district is noted for its large Democratic vote, but has about the worst roads in the county. Before the snow fell mud was nearly axle deep, and now snow is piled in places as high as the fence posts. The County Commissioners are respectfully requested to give this section a little more at tention. Tyrone Items. Fanners are done their fall plowing prepar atory to another corn crop, and now are directing their attention to threshing grain, getting wood for winter and butchering.

Fritz four spring pigs, 696; Amos Fowble three about 5 . months old, 383. Jos. Myers has a Jersey red hog which he intends to kill about the middle of January, and jt is thought it will , weigh about 700 pounds. Rev. Mr. Senders has a class or 26 cate chumens, which he meets once a week at Baust Church. Geo. C. Harman, an ex-soldier of the late war, is writing his recollections of the T ilder ness battle of May 5—6 to Laurel Hill, May 8, 9 and 10, 1864. He was a member of the sth Corps, commanded by Gen. Warren. When completed he intends having the recollections published in the county papers. Rev. Mr. Delp will preach on bunday, De cember 26, at Baust Church, ftt 10 o clock, a. m. Hampstead Items. Since our last report on the weight of a porker we have received a chalenge, accord i ing to Marquis of Queensbury Rules, without gloves, but owing to our conscientious scruples fn regard to capitol punishment (remember the O,) we respectfully declined. However we will venture again by being more careful in giving the names and exact weights handed us bv Chas. W. Richards, who killed four, weighing 405, 395, 380, 383; Wm. Buchraan, . two, ten months old, weighing 412 and 376; John Armacost, three spring pigs, 326, 288, 278; George Rupp, one, 390; Elijah Arma cost, five, 1,540. George W. Keller has a cow that pulls the beam at 1,260 pounds. Diphtheria has broken out in our town and the first victim was buried on last Saturday, in the person of Mintie Wilson, daughter of John Wilson, aged about five years. If we were a poet we would write some thing on the Beautiful Snow; but then we would run the risk of being taken put and shot by order of the staff. Taneytown Items. The great Lillian Alexander Dramatic Com pany exhibited on Monday evening in Ecken rode’s hall. The drama played was “Lady Audley’s Secret” and was given with great success. The troupe will remain all the week. The trial of Josiah Adelsperger, burguess of Taneytown, for stoning a serenading party, was held on Wednesday, before Henry Galt, Esq. On last Sunday night Rev. D. N. Dittmar filled the Reformed pulpit to the satisfaction of all present. Mr. Dittmar is a fluentspeaker, fresh in thought, free and graceful in his manner. After singing the first hymn, the infant son of Rev. Mr. Ditzler was baptized. The service was impressive and should be followed by all who have children to conse crate to the Master, as the church is the proper place for the service as well as that of the Holy Communion. December. Aquarius rules the frozen skies. Deep-frowning clouds on clouds arise, Fraught with the winds loud roar; With fury heaves the raging main. When foaming billows lash in vain The hoaree-resounding shore. When the year was divided by the Romans into ton months, this division was called De cember, in referenpe to its numerical place in the calendar. It is from the Latin decern , meaning ten. By the ancient §axons it was called Winter-monat , or Winter-moptbi but after their conversion to Christianity, tljey designated it as Heligh-nionqt, or Holy month, fro the anniversary which occqrs in it of the birth of Christ. From the sme gircucostance the modern Germans distinguish it by the epithet of Chrwf-iuonat. In this month occurred the old Roman Saturnalia , a period marked by general license and mer rymaking. The same is now our Christmas. CIRCUIT COURT PROCEEDINGS. When the Advocate’s report closed last week Court was engaged in hearing the case of Byers vs. Maulsby.

BtJRKE AND KENNEDY 4 They Get Nearly theFuU Extent of the Law- The Jury’s Eecoxnmendation Ignored. The Advocate last week announced the conviction of James Kennedy and John Burke, Jr., of murder in the second degree for killing John Curran at Locust timore,* on October 16. The jury on all the ballots, except the last, stood six for man slaughter, four for murder in the second de gree and two for murder in the first degree. The jury, in rendering their verdict, com mended the prisoners to the mercy ot the court. The verdict differed from the general sentiment of the community, most people who heard the testimony believing that the accus ed were gnilty of manslaughter, and regarded five years imprisonment as ample punishment The affair grew out of a political disagree ment, and the killing was done in a fight. On Saturday the prisoners received the judgment of the court The hour for sentence was" not known, as it depended upon the action of the counsel for defense, and the court house almost looked deserted as com pared with its appearance during the progress of the trial. About 11 o’clock Mr. Pearson, accompan ied by a representative of the Advocate, called at the jail to see the prisoners, and . found them surrounded by eight or ten of their relatives, who had been with them dur ing their trial. They looked a hundred per cent, better than on the day previous, when they listened with depressed spirits at the able argument of State’s Attorney Henning, as he contended for a verdict of murder in the first degree, and afterward waited nervously for the conclusion of the jury. In reply to questions as to what they thought of the ver dict, they said that they regarded it as unjust, but concluded not to lake any further legal steps and would accept whatever sentence the court saw proper to pronounce and serve their terms like men. As the visitors were leaving the jail Mr. Pearson received a telegram from Messrs. Heuisler and Cook, iu reference to withdraw ing exceptions noted during the trial, and re turned and told the prisoners to prepare for Shortly before 12 o’clock Mr. Pearson ap peared in court, and stated that counsel for defense concluded to withdraw all exceptions. At this Judge Miller requested Sheriff Lyrico to bring in the prisoners, and a few minutes later they stood in the dock. When asked by the court whether they had anything to say,both Burke and Kennedy answered “No. ’ The judge then imposed almost the extreme penalty of the law, sentencing them to seven teen years and six months in the penitentiary, 1 conceding only six months out of respect to the jury’s recommendation of mercy, eighteen years being the limit of imprisonment for 1 murder in the second degree. The entire proceedings did not occupy three minutes, and the prisoners were back to their cell in the jail within ten minutes from the time they 1 left it. The prisoners did not expect such a sen tence, thinking the jury’s recommendation ' would certainly count for something in their ! favor. Their friends spent Sunday with them. On Monday morning the prisoners were 1 taken to the penitentiary by Deputy Sheriff Zeiber. They were taken on the 7 o’clock train, and thus avoided a crowd at the depot, which certainly would have collected had the hour of their departure been later. At Baltimore, too, the crowd assembled at Hil ‘ len Station was avoided, by leaving the train ‘ at Union Depot. The report in the Baltimore papers that Kennedy broke down and wept ; bitterly on the cars is declared by Mr. Zeiber to be utterly without foundation. The prisoners are now safely confined. For ; good behavior they get a reduction ot two months on every year, and by complying with , the rules their sentence can be reduced to about fourteen years. NOTES. John Burke, father of John Burke, Jr., is i much depressed by the verdict and sentence. He is well advanced in life, and is possessed of a considerable fortune. John is his only i child, and he will likely be long in his grave , before his son is liberated. His money and : home, he says, are nothing to him without his b °y- ~. o A row occurred at Locust Point on baturr | day afternoon, and first reports attributed r the origin to the bad feeling engendered be tween the friends of Curran and Burke and Kennedy. Pete Leary and Michael Divers, two witnesses for the State in the recent trial, > were run out of a saloon, and Leary knocked ; down, by Thomas Knox. The affair bad ;* nothing to do with the trial here. i • NEW ADVERTISEMENTS. [ Mortgagee’s Sale of Valuable Property, ! Machine Shops, Machinery, Ac—Jeremiah ! Rinehart, Mortgagee.

NOTHING SUCCEEDS LIKE SUCCESS. j The maxim above is one which in every 1 sphere of life a human being should always remember, and concentrate his ideas in con ; formity with the same, and no matter what circumstances to the contrary should at first present themselves, they should always re member that nothing succeeds like success. We therefore with pride point to the fact, and ■ would illustrate that Messrs. S. Kaon, Son A Co., the popular Dry Goods Merchants of this city, are imbued with the spirit of our maxim, i. Coming to our busy city but a few weeks ago they started a big enterprise, opening an es tablishment and displaying therein a line of Dry Goods, Notions and Carpets which to-day is the largest of its kind in any of the counties in the state. By fair dealing they have in gratiated themselves in the good graces of our community, and as their goods are the cheapest, their stock the largest, they have further studied how to merit the approval of the public, and will therefore during the coming holidays offer, so we have been in formed, extra inducements in every line in their store, and especially in their Cloak De partment. We know that no merchant wishes to carry from season to season any stock in that particular line, and therefore we can say boldly that we know Messrs. Kann, Son A Co. will offer- special prices in Ladies’ and Cfiilfireq’s Cloaks. But to come back to our starting point, we would'say in conclusion that we offer to Messrs. Kann, Son A Co. our admiration in which they have so successfully started their new venture, and we wish them a continued success. The largest assortment of Christmas Candies can be found at Hurley’s new store, Albaugh Building. 2t

Berret expresses “regret at inadvertence in senseless, fruitless controversy” of our eternal process. Well, Berret was further from our thoughts than the scene of earth quakes, of which we were writing, when we said they were the result of eternal process moving on. Berret quoted the latter sentence and then intruded as follows; “This takes our breath. Is there no balm in Gilead ? Does not omniscience see, and omnipotence guide?” But more later. And now he says we have mania iu saying we were arraigned. He says we “speak truthfully in saying he had night-mare when he blundered across the danger line of ceaseless, self-propelling process.” We never could see any legitimate reason why he intruded and obtruded, the senseless, fruitless controversion at our eternal process. His saying we have eternal process on the brain is but proof that we have kept to the point he fruitlessly attempted to con trovert; while on his part, it has been this thing and that thing, one thing and another thing, something and nothing, and everything and anything oat of which he could manipu late a “conglomeration” which he would hurl at us and then change base. In proof we we give what Berret now says, as follows: “The only point at issue is, whether polar contraction is the cause of equatorial disten tion or the latter the cause of the former?” Why this point has not been mooted—can not be—has no existence only as the result of eternal process, hence is not pertinent to the first issue. And if Berret hugs the belt while we compress the poles, it would be just as fruitless as arguing the question, “If a fence rail has too ends, how has it any beginning? ’ For an end cannot be a beginning, and the intermediate is neither beginning nor end. If we say one and two make three, Berret demurs and says n—o —not that way —two and one make three; and so be has bandied us about all around creation. In fact when he so hor roringly gasped—“breath taken—more later” —raising his first point, approaching which we found him at another, so has he continued till he has made a few less than the points of the compass; and when we would have him come back to the point that took his breath, he says, “not at all, for after all, it amounts to nothing at all, but eternal process, and that is all.” And we say, if it is all after all, that Berret has knocked all the bottom out of eter nal process —no not at all; but according to his own showing, eternal process knocked all the wind out of Berret Day. [For the Democratic Advocate] Mathematical. Union Bridge, Dec. 7, 1886. Messrs. Editors :—Several weeks ago there appeared in your paper this problem, viz: “A and B buy 100 acres of land for $200; one part suits A better for his purpose than the other, and he agrees to pay 50 cents per acre more for it Each, however, invests SIOO. How much did each get, and what was the price paid by each per acre?” A week or two following its insertion the answer appeared as follows: A took 40 acres at $2.50 per acre and 860 acres at sl.66£*. In j this solution the author has failed to state the cause of the discrepencies that at sight appear, for the difference in two prices according to the conditions is not 50 cents, nor do the prices make an average of $2 per acre, the buying price. This being so, a student just learning mathematics is not benefited much by what has been stated. The author of it may have forgotten this part. This proposi tion and similar ones ought not to be passed without accompanied with further explana tion. The following example is one of the same class, viz: A B and C buy 300 acres of land for S9OO, each paying equal amounts. B agrees to pay $1 per acre more than A and C, $2 per acre more than A. How much does each buy and at what price per acre ? I have not given this example to test anyone s skill, but as it is one of class referred to, would be pleased if some one would give a solution and describe the difference that exists between the two examples. Student. Our correspondent is mistaken. That is not the answer. The exact answer cannot be i given, as was stated two weeks ago. —Bns. Proceedings of Congress. Congress reassembled last Monday.
