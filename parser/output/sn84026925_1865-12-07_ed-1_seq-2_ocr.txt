Hie hirer agreed, in writing, to convey to ' the substitute a tract of land, for whioh suit was brought. Chancellor Steele, of Tennessee, has annulled the oontract. He declares that the recognition of the Confederates as "belligerents was induoed by considerations of humanity, and in no wise invest a ed the "so-oalled" with rights of nationali. fcy. Henoe oontraota made in oontemplation of the existenoe of suoh Government, in obedience to its exactions, and to promote its ends, are in derogation of publio morals aud law, and are void. 1 The United States -Gazette relates ?the following inoident: A gentleman hid V &n nlrT And Dnined V)r\raa mknDA j. | - *"v" OlfiUK wno uotective.

When in the stable the spectacles are removed. * The Secretary of the Pennsylvania Steel Works has deoided to accept what ii known as the Feeker Farm, two and a hall miles south east of Harrisburg. The ground at that point is contiguous to the Suusqehanna River, and immediately on the Pennsyl vania Railroad. Engineers were on th? plot surveying the neoessary lines for the area required for the erection of the works K is admitted by all practical machinists that this enterprise Mil be the most exten sire of its kind ever ereoted in America and is to be on this continent, what tb< celebrated works of Wade and Butcher, ai Sheffield, are to Europe. Une toousanc experienced workmen in steel will bi brought from England, while fifteen hun dred other skilled mechanics will be requir ed for the fall operation of these works. The rale applies to the redemptioi .of the United States Treasury notes thai all should understand?that is, if a portioi pf the note be* taken off, and the principa part be presented for redemption, deduotioi is made in proportion to the amount of thi note that is missing j if only a oorner is ton off, deduotion is made aooordingly. Wheth er this is a matter of law, or mere regulatioi of the Department, we do not know; but i is well for all, e9peoially the laboring mass es, to bear is mind. Latterly the Chemucj Canal Natiuuul Dauh of Elatira, New York has adopted the same principal in the re demption of its notes. If the banks are t adopt it as a rule, the announcement Bhoul be distinctly made, that those who can i! afford to bp deprived of any part of wba they have or reoeive, may know what to de . pend on. i A correspondent pf the Baltimor Gazette, is responsible for the following "Mr. Davis sinoe his imprisonment, ha twioe had his hair cut. On the first occa sion General Miles took possession of th hair whiob was shorn. On the second oc oasion Mr. Davb carried off his hair to hi quarters, bat soon an orderly came dashing np from the General and demanded th< hair, but Mr. Davis had already destroyed it. The late Confederate President is al lowed to walk upon the ramparts. Recent ly a large number of ladies, friends of Gen Miles, posted themselves in such a way thai Mr. Davis would have to pass them. Mr Davis seeing their object, turned baok tc his quarters. The ladies tferenot'to be that deprived of a close inspection, so they followed after him at a good pace, whereupon Mr. Davis seated himself and lit-bis cigar, the odor of which must have been offensive to their delicate senses, for General Miles sent word next day that Mr. Davis was not to be allowed any more cigars." In a speech at Monnt Carbon (Pa. j on the 21st ulti no, Senator Sherman made the following remarks; "During the war the Government was oompelled to resort tc the utmost limits of taxation; but I am i happy to say that the business of Congress j will be, after securing peace upon the basis of universal' liberty, to relieve ourselves from taxation no longer necessary. In ma- ' king this reduotion we naturally look to J those articles, the ohief oost of which is low labor. The foundation of wealth is, and ] should be, as free from burdens as the air. ( The oheerfulness with which all classes and oooupations bore taxes during the war, makes it doubly the duty of Congress to 1 lessen and equalise the taxes now.

Thii institution formed the wealth of the South It was the base of credit at home anc abroad. 'Heretofore, a man in" the Sort! was considered rich, not because he v/ai possessed of coffers of gold, but because b< owned a large number of negroes. Hence by the abolition nf slavery, the South hai been made poor?emphatically poor. All the other resources of the South weri exhausted in carrying on the. war, or des troyed by the enemy. What have we lef us ? Nothing except tbe soil. This, it 1 Raid, is rioh io resources. It is readii' granted.' Bat it has to be patiently cnltiva ted; and where ia the laborer ? Is it tbh fre negro? No I no, is responded >by all th' antecedents of the African race. His idea of freedom are narrow and contracted mean and grovelling.

Little need we expect fropi tb freedmen of the country. Whence then it is asked, is the Sooth to look for redemp tion from her miserable state of poverty From the Yankees ? No, most assuredl; not!

Fames L. Ore, Governor elect, aocompalied-hy bis Excellency B. F. Pebby, Provisional Governor, and the Joint Committee )f Arrangements, entered the ball.^ The Provisional Governor then addressed the Members of the General Assembly - as follows : iSenators and Membert of the l A House of Representatives : . I have come here to-day to bid you farewell, as Provisional Governor of South Carolina, and to oongratnlate you on the restoration of the State, once more, to Tsolf gov* ernment and independence, as a member of the Federal Union. Like the leader of God's ohosen people of old, I had the honor of oondnotinfc yoa tbroagh the wilderness, within sight of the promised land, bat am not permitted to enter it. Tiiat great boon has been reserved for my distibgnished friend, who is now abont to be inaugurated as the first Chief Magistrate of the State ever elected by the sovereign people. If oot withio "three days/' be will witnin a, very short time'be able to pass yon over tbe coo fusion and * military rale, noder which you have sd long lived; to that happy state in which yon will be able to govern yourselves, and to enjoy all tHe rights and privileges of a free and enlightened people. Under* hw-idae and able administration, I hope to see the good old State revive, prosper, and be onee more happy. I am sore, gentlemen, that I may say with perfect propriety, as the representative of tbe Federal Government in Sooth Carolina, that the State has done enongfa to entitle her to be received back as a member of tbe Federal Union, with all of her Constitutional rights fully restored. She was > 1 i_ ? if. ...i ?f JanAMW in' ioreujoat iu tuauuiiug tuc poot ui u?ug? <u the recent revolution, and in ber appeal lo afms in defenoe of what she honestly believed to be ber reserved rights as a State. Gallantly and nobly her sons fought through the war, pouring out their blood and sacrificing their lives on almost every battle field throughout tbe Southerp States.? When conquered by overwhelming numbers, seeing their towQ^and villages nothing but smouldering ruins, their beloved State a wide-spread desolation, their wives, and sisters, and little children, and aged parents at the point of starvation, like brave men they accepted tbe deorecs of God, and" thomBAloAB tn (ha itira frtrtnnfifl* of thewar. Sad and silent, With manly fortitude and firmness, they awaited the terms of the conqueror. When those terms .were made known, they wefe first, with a generous pride and high chivalry, to assome the humiliation with which their State had been foremost in brihging on onr common country. As soon as the President's Proclamation was issued, the people of South Carolina went cheerfully forward, and took the amnesty oath. They promptly assembled in Convention, under the order ofthe Provisional Governor, and reformed their State Constitution, as was desired by the President. They.abolished slavery, and freely gave up their two hundred millions invested in slaves. When advised to adopt the Congressional amendment to the Constitu: tion of tbe United States abolishing slavery, South Carolina was the first Southern State wbicn raimea toe same, ana set an example for her sister States to follow:? She has been first, also, in preparing a wise and humane oode of laws for the .protection of the freedmen in all their rights of personal property, and allowiog them to give testimony in her Conrts of Justice. She has now elected her Representatives in both Houses of Congress, and commissioned them to take their seats in that body. She has organized a perfect State Government, jritb Legislative, Executive and Judiciary Departments, all republican, in .their character, and the members of each swearing to sop ?? - it.

UUIVCU Her Ordinances of secession have been repealed, and she now pledges herself to stand by the Union in good faith, and with 1fll sincerity. Having done all this, yon and your State I have done your doty, gracefully and faith; folly, as becomes a gallant aod generous I people, who are ueverafraidto assume any position where honor and patriotismprompt. I know the President desires to relieve you of military rule, and see your Representatives once more seated in the. councils of the nation. I cannot believe that Congress I will exolade them, by a test oath, which does not apply to members of Congress, for they are not members of the Federal Government, as was early deeided in the history of our Government. Nor has Congress any power to impose on its vemben any other oath than that prescribed in the Constitution. To admit a contrary doctrine, would enable a majority in Congress to exolttde the minority, because they were Democrats, or States Rights' men, or professed any oth er principles^repugnant to the breed* of the majority. The Constitutional oath was wisely ordained, and; excludes all other oaths. The powers of Congress are delegated and specific, and they have no otbejn. The reason for the passage of. this test oath has passed away, aod~if' not repealed, nc hue io South Carolina cau fill a Federal of fice till a new generation has sprung up, foi all now Hvincr. men. women and children. did, io some way, couoteuaibe the:w4r. It is known to yon, gentlemen, that ] was opposed to the secession of South Caro Una. No mate in America regretted nion deeply than I "did this fetal movement, fo I thought 1 foresaw ail the evil consequgn ces which have resulted from it. But, wbei the issoewas made, my feelings in sympa tby were all of my native State. And yet I conscientiously believed that even tb ? . .-ft r^VWVMi* V* tn? 'y.v rlisastrous. The jealoneiee and errors of A -he Grecian States were (instantly in my WBB mind. Disintegration once commenced in. ?. fl a confederation of republics, no One could . K foresee where it wonld end, except ropet- ^Qj ty tyrannies, or a consolidated military dee- . %5B potiom. BsBb Henceforth, no,.on/rvirilI repudiate the MB farewell advice of Washington, aa to the Ji importance and perpetuity of the Federal |^8| Union. It has shown a power and strength, fl moral and physical, whioh defy dissolution, till some extraordinary change bee taken I place in the condition of -thepeople. The ffigjsl tendency of divilisatioti is to enlarge Gov- B e rumen ts, and not to disintegrate then.
