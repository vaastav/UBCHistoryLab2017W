U, 1803- It mokes us smile to hear the Toledo Blade talk about MoKlnley's simplicity- Mr. Van Allen has shown bimnelf to be a more manly man than any of his traducers. What has become of those fellows who charged Secretary Carlisle with being Ignorant of finances? The ODDositiou to the Wilson tariff bill is mostly where it was expected to be in the Republican party. The Holgate Timet dubs the Signal "the alleged Republican paper of Hen ry oounty." In order: PiHtols or cigars, The man who argues that the "hard times" would not have come had Har rison been reelected, may be ingenious, but be isn't honest. Gov. McKinley hasappointed John W. Knaubof Dayton as chief inspec tor of workshops and factories, vice W. L. McDonald, removed. A New York preacher bas discover ed or rather he thinks, thai there is no hell, except that which exists in the living mind. How did he find out? Instead of wasting time trying to explain how it happened, the Demo crats should get right down to work and see that it don't happen again. If Ambassador-noi-to-be Van Alen has displomatic ability equal to his letter-writing talent, his failure to go to Italy as U. 8. Ambassador is a public Iosb. Thos. Axworthy, the defaulting treasurer of Cleveland, who has been sojourning at Hamilton, Ontario, for some years, died last week of Brlght's disease. The annual report of President Cleveland's "boy Comptroller of Cur rency" shows the wisdom of the selec tion of Mr. Eckels for that important position. If it took the citizens of Maine seven months to raise $15 towards the erec tion of a monument to the late James G. Blaine, how long will it take to build the monument? Republicans In Congress may as well understand that the country Is In no humor to stand any unnecessary lengthening of the tariff debate, either in the House or the Senate, There is one highly commendable feature about the annual report of very member of the cabinet the en tire absence of any attempt to secure notoriety by the advocacy of some Ideal scheme. President Cleveland's message is a corker. Its length' should not pre vent every Democrat becoming thor oughly acquainted with its contents; It is thoroughly patriotic and thorough . ly Democratic. . Nova Scotia miners and Canada coal dealers are loudly protesting against that section of the Wilson tar lffblll which puts coal on the free list they will endeavor to secure legislation from the Canadian parliament that will prevent their trade being absorbed by Americans.

BANKER Tberb has been - lot of fool talk about the change In the head of the Knights of Labor. When that or any other organitation reaches the stage In which one man Is necessary to Its ex istence, Its end is not far off. Thb man who spends his money liberally for Christmas presents Is doubly a philanthropist; he makes the receivers of the presents fcappy and adds his money to that in active circu lation, thus benefiting trtrybody, ninv self included. Thb most diligent canvasser of the House has only found two Democrats who will acknowledge their Intention to rote against the new tariff bill. Still editors who have no regard for the truth contiowe to fill their papers with ridiculous stories about 'Demo cratic opposition" to that measure. Some Republican employers of labor are jumping at the chance to make po litical capital and money at one aod the same tim, by reducing their em ployes wages and charging the reduc tion to the new tariff bill. Keep your eve on that class of men. It may be necessary to teach them a needed lesson in the near future. - The day has gone by when you could haul a man over the coals for his religious opinions. Two hundred years ago men were -tortured o aeain or burned at the stake for believing what is preached by some preachers to-day There are a few blind bigotsstill in ex istence, who would like to burn a vic tim at the stake if they only had the power. The postotlleo department of the government has decreed that all post offices whose names have heretofore ended with "tre" shall hereafter be spelled "ter" and that all offices whose names ended with "burgh" shall here after be spelled without the "h." Oth er changes have been authorized as the administration believes in simplicity in all things. Judge Norms of Marlon was In the city on Saturday, circulating around among the boys, looking up his pros pects for the nomination for Circuit Judge next year in this district. Our sanctum was honored with a call from the Judge and we round him an ex ceedingly pleasant gentleman. He has the reputation of being quite popular upon the Common Pleas bench in the Marion district, and is considered one of the best Common Pleas judges in the State. He would honor the Circuit bench. It costs just 12.00 more per ton to manufacture steel rails In the United States than it costs In England. A tar Iff of $4.00 a ton would shut out foreign competition unless the price of foreign rails be reduced, but Carnegie and his fellows, who have made millions out of govern men t bounty., predict destruc- tion of the American steel rail busi ness, it would nave been cheaper for the Government to have put Carnegie and his whole gang on the pension list at the outset than to have given them such a chance as they have had to handicap railroad building by exorbl tant prices for rails. Congress Bnould lose no time making the Wilson tariff bill a law. not a perfect measure, but it Is such a great improvement on the McKinley law that it should be put into effect at the earliest possible time, as the soon er the period of business stagnation which necessarily accompanies the change is over, the better it will be, That prosperity will follow the adop tion of the new tariff, and that it will be general prosperity, not the prosper! ty of favored classes, is as cereal n as that day follows night. But Demo crats in Congress must remember that this prosperity will not come until the new law is an accomplished fact. In the early part of the present cen tury the American flag floated in every part of the civilized world; her hardy seamen braved the storms or every ocean: England's supremacy of the high Beas was challenged: America with her thousands of miles of sea-girt coasts, her world-famed harbors, and the undaunted spirit of her free people, had almost the commerce of the world at her feet, until the accursed trade re striction, the Chinese wall of Com merce, has frozen the life blood that formerly coursed through the arteries of trade. Like a pestilence it has driven the American flag from the seas, until to-day all our carrying trade is done upon foreign bottoms. The Republican parly endeavors to build up the marl time commerce upon the same policy it applied to the internal affairs of the Dation. In order to have one trans-At lantic liner fly the American colors the City or Paris Is paid $50,000 per year to fly the stars and stripes. It proposes to replace the colors on the ocean by subsiding ships to carry our flag and proudly points to the fact that if the money holds out we will have plenty of ships that will claim American al legiance. They claim this is the policy of "protection" the "American plan It Is the policy of infamy, the pathway of disgrace.

Mon day a man hailing from Kentucky, agreed to buy one of Crone's farms for (60 an acrs, and gave) Crone 910 to bind the bargain. He then went to Mans field, leaving Crone his address there, and promising to return in a week. The same day a second real estate dealer fell in love with the same farm, and wanted to buy it for (100 an acre. Crone explained how he had already sold it, but agreed with . the second stranger that perhaps the first might be induced to withdraw from his contract. Crone accordingly went to Mansfield and paid stranger No. 1 $500 to withdraw from the contract. When he returned stranger No. i was not present, nor is he yet. OLD FEUD SETTLED.

A Qvat Tnnnel. Denver, Dec. 12. A wonderful piece of engineering has just been accom plished in the boring of the Busk-Ivan- hoe railway tunnel -under the continent al divide of the Rocky mountains at Haeeerman Pass, Colo. The tunnel is almost two miles long 9,289 feet; and is through solid gray granite. It took three years and 29 days, of 24-hour days, to bore the bis hole, 10,800 feet above the sea level, through the top ridge of the continent. The water draining from one side ef the mountain, under which it is driven, runs to the Atlantic ocean and from the other to the Pacific. Its con struction has cost $1,000,000 and 20 hu man lives. The tunnel, which is on the Colorado Midland railway, the Santa Fs's central route to California, substi tutes two miles of track for Vf, and does away with one of the most expensive railway climbs in the world.

It can b stated positively that Japan has no pur pose of assuming a protectorate over Ha waii in case the United States should abandon it status there. At the Japanese legation here this theory is declared to be visionary. A Japanese warship was sent to Honolulu some time ago in order to insure protection, during these critical times, to the 20,000 Japanese on the isl ands. This, it is stated, was not a step toward acquiring or controlling Hawaii, as it is not to the interest of Japan to extend her present government relations with the islands. They Wont Hots 1.11. Yokohama, Dec 12. The China, which left Honolulu Nov. 28, has ar rived. When the steamer left the island the provisional government was in power. The action of the United States govern ment was awaited with the greatest anx iety. The members of the provisional government, however, were resolute in their declarations against the restoration of the monarchy. All Quiet I'p to December 4. ' Victoria, B. C, Dec. 12.

Since the arrival of the last reports there have been but two things of a sig nificant nature. The annexationists held a massmeeting on Saturday, Nov. 25, and adopted reso lutions in effect appealing to congress over the address of President Cleveland, Secretary Gresham and Mr. Blount. iour days preceding the sailing of the steamer the troops of the provisional gov ernment were busy fortifying and barri cading the government house or castle. Doesn't Meed Any Help. San Francisco, Dec. 11. The steam er Transit brought news from Hawaii up to Nov. 20. During the afternoon the Alameda sailed Minister Willis made a state ment, virtually as already published by the Associated Press, that nothing defi nite would be done here until he had received a reply to the dispatches sent to Washington by ths Alameda. This statement was published in The Star, The Bulletin published a letter from Minister Willis, in which he said he wished his remarks in The Star to ap ply to the entire press of Honolulu. The stand taken by Minister Willis in his interview with The Star which was revised in proof by him before publica tion caused considerable anxiety in government circles owing to the inti mation that any breach of the peace would be punished by the American minister. To the Associated Press his words were: "Any trouble precipitated on the other side would be stopped at once by the United States forces. On the morning of the lTth, the day after the Alameda left. President Dole called upon Minister Willis to learn how far the authority of the United States was expected to be carried in case of an emergency. Upon his return it was learned that the provisional gov ernment was fully satisfied with the explanation and limitations made by Minister Willis. Conveyed More Than Was Intended. It is the general opinion that the original language used by the United States minister conveyed more than he intended it should.- It is understood that President Dole very clearly in formed the minister that the provision al government commanded the situa tion and would require no aid from the united btates unless it was called tor. The president assured tne minister that any breach of peace which might occur would be speedily dealt with by the Hawaiian government. The piovisonal government received assurance on tne points mentioned which were perfectly satisfactory, it is understood that Minister Willis said be would stand hack of the nresent gov ernment until the present difficulty wfcs settled. The tension in political mat ters since the departure of the Alame da has only partially relaxed. Minister Willis stated be made the public state ment that "nothing immediate would be done" to ease matters down, as he believed a crisis was approaching. His remedy worked for a few hours. but it now appears he has divulged just enough to stimulate speculation. and both sides interpret his explana tion favorably which, in the end will doubtless add fuel to the political fire, When the attention of the United States minister was called to the fact that the provisional government would aid him itfkeeping the peace, he replied that he did not expect trouble unless it came from irresponsible persons on either side. Would It Mean Warf The provisional government expresses ths opinion that the use of force on the part of the United States would be equivalent to a declaration of war, Resident Americans have at least 1.500 rifles and ammunition in private hands which it would ne impossible to seize in case of restoration. Those best post ed say the throne would not stand an hour after the withdrawal of Ameri can troops. The theory of restoration, however will not be believed here until the last moment. Should it then provel true serious trouble will likely follow. This much is admitted by the clearest heads on both sides. In conversation with the Associated Press reporter, Minister Willis said he was confident that legislation favorable to the Hawaiian Islands would shortly take place in the united states.
