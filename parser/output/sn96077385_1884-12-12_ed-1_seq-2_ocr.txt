Tfie Times OWOSSO. FRIDAY, DEC. 12. 1884. GEO. M. DEWEY. Editor.. , THE MESSAGE. In ihc last issue of The Tim em wc placed be.'ore our readers the very conservative and ' business like uus sije of President Arthur, with a prom ise of tome editorial notice in thi issue; and yet, the. message as a whole evinces such a good comprehension of the National needs, and so many valuable suggestions that a brief re view, fuch as we have space to give, will hardly do its able, and candid author justice. Speaking of the perils of a compul sory silver coinage, the necessity of improving our harbor defences, a:id rebuilding our navy, and the impera tive duty of providing a bankrupt law the President repeats with em phasis his previous recommendations whicii Congress has hitherto disre garded or only partially adopted; but which from year to year becomes more urgent. There are other recom mendations which are renewals of past suggestions or endorsements of views set forth in the department re ports that are ol much public interest, but the most striking portion of the message is that which outlines a policy for the extension of our foreign trade. This policy involves four dis tinct features: First, a series of re ciprocal commercial treaties with the other countries on this continent, with a view to securing unhampered conditions of trade; second,' the es tablishment of our consular service on a salaried footing; third, fostering a steam carrying marine under our flag; and fourth, the establishment of a uniform currency basis for the countries of America, regulated by a monetary union. This policy is at once very broad and decidedly positive, and is well deserving of the most careful consid eration. On the basis of the fust proposition treaties arc already ne gotiated with Mexico, and with Spain regarding her Cuban possessions, and are in one form or another pending before Congress, and should be stud ied with careful reference to its effects on our industrial interests. The people should remember that the end sought to be accomplished is the free admission to this country of such merchandise as we do not produce, in return for the admission free or under a favored system of duties, of our own products, these conditions to apply only to goods carried in vessels belonging to the countries concerned. It is claimed that this system would open an outlet to many of our pro ducts, and would at the same time foster and develop our carrying trade. This policy thus outlined by Presi dent Arthur has many points of re semblance to that entertained by Mr. Blaine when Secretary of State It is a policy essentially American, and yet inviting free and mutual ad vantagious relations with other countries. Probably the main difficul ties to be encountered in its execution would be the arranging of the details. Just how these mutual consessions are to be so arranged as to secure the largest possible cood and inflict the smallest possible injury is the problem which will have to be considered tin der varying conditions in different cases. And while from our past ex perience we are inclined to believe all recipiocity treaties are to the detri ment of our industrial interest, yet the policy suggested presents for the . consideration of the people a definite course to be petsucd, and it may be possible that our legislation can be so shaped as to secure a close friendship and more prosperous commercial re lations with the countiies upon this continent, to the great advantage of our commerce and to the building up of an extended carrying trade flying the flag of the United States, without doing injustice either to the interests of capital or labor, though we doubt whether this can be done under any recipiocity treaty with any nation either American or on the other side of the great Ocean. The Times notes with congratula tions the marriage ofOrin Starr, of the Howell Republican, and Florence Johnson, of Saline, on Thanksgiving day. Among late interesting news paper events of the past week was the consolidation of Chaff with Every Saturday, the best society papers ever printed in Michigan. WIT AND

"You are very lato sending your evening male out," 6aid the editor to his daughter when lio came home at two in the morning and met a timid, shrinking young man between the front door and gate. "Jfot at all," answered the thoughtful girl; "Charles Henry Is now a morning edition." "I don't like these shoes," said a lady customer, "because the soles aro too thick." "Is that the only ob jection?" blandly asked the shop keeper. "Yes," was the reply. "Then, madam, if you take the shoes, I can assure vou that the objection will gradualfy wear away." A young widow with a genius for ad vertising herself had inscribed upon tho tombstone of her late husband, "Sa cred to the memory of Mathusin Uenuchct, who departed this lifo aged sixty-eight years, regretting tho necessity of parting from the most charming and best of women." A New York physician says that a baby must not bo allowed to sleep with its mother. Must not be allowed! Did, anybody know of a baby that ever slept witii its mother or anybody elseP This New York physician ought to know that a baby never goes to sleep until it is time for everybody else to get up. Then how tho littlo darling will sleep. "Yes, brethren," says the clergyman who is preaching tho funeral seimon, "our deceased brother was cut down in a single night torn from tho arms of his loving wife, who is thus left a dis consolate widow at the early age of 24 years." "Twenty-two, if you please," sobs tho widow, in the front pew, emerging from her handkerchief for an instant. Paris rapcr. She evidently was in great distress. "What is the matter?" asked an in timate friend. "Why, Pvo lost my pocketbook, and it had my card and address in it." "Then it may bo re turned to your residence." "Oh, gra cious, I hope not. There's nothing in it but a receipt for a face-powder and two unpaid dressmakers' dunning let ters, that I would not have George to see for the world." It is very strange how quick some people will change their minds. A man in Vermont imagined that ho was inspired to kill Mrs. Adams, a school teacher, and after thinking it over for some timetlecided to do so. Ho called upon the lady and acquainted her with his mission, when she seized a club and knocked him down, after which sho broke nearly every bone in his body. Then he concluded ho didn't want to kill her. Feck's Sun. Tho coat was a very bad n't too full in tho back. "That'll never do," said tho customer; "it's liko a shirt on a bean-pole."

"What is the meaning of that red lino above the fourth story of your house?" asked a stranger ol a man near Pittsburg. "That is a water mark. That mark shows how high tho water was during the great overflow about a year ago." "Impossible! If the water had been that high the whole town would have been swept away." 'The water never was that high. It only came up to the first-story window, but the ciysed bovs rubbed it out three or four times, so 1 put it up there where they can't get at it.

Yesterday an old horse being driven along High street before a wagon loaded with dirt fell down, and. in stead of being at all concerned about it, the negro driver got a rest for the small of his back, and tilled his pipe for a smoke.

"There's no use talking boys," re marked a traveling man, "there is a thing that travels faster than a railroad train or the telegraph. It is slang. A few months ago I left New York for an Indian agency way down in tho Indian Territory to look after the filling of a contract our house has there. Tho night before I left town I was walking up U roadway, when I heard for tho first time the latest greeting slang of the street. It was then fresh and new. Well, the night of my arrival at the agency, hundreds of miles from civili zation, I took a littlo walk. Imagine my surprise to hear a little half-breed squaw whom I passed, accost us with: "Ah, there, my dear. I'll abduct you." At the entrance to one of the promin ent dry goods stores on Federal street, Allegheny, lust evening, a lady, remarkable for the wax-like appearance of her complexion, stood waiting for a car. A young man, accompanied by two ladies, passed in and came out in a few minutes. The lady was still stand ing like a statue in the same position. The young man said, "Now just look nt this," and raised his hand and struck the supposed figure a smart slap on the cheek. Tho statue turned a pair of Hashing black eyes on him and wilted him with a look. Ho stammered inco herently.

Tho Secretary of a Western railroad corporation, who laid his report on tho desk of tho President tho lirst of tho ?'ear, was asked what kind of a showing 10 had made. "Taking tho whole year wo have run 75,000 behind ex penses, sir." "How about tho lirst six months?" "Why, wo cleared about $30,000. The lirst six months of tho year with us always shows a prolit, but the last six months pulls us down." "Exactly. Please cut your report in halves. Wo'll publish tho lirst six months for the benelit of people look ing for paying stocks, ana we'll keep tho next six months hero to show to stockholders who come to inquiro why wo don't pay dividends."

"Ue causo they won't have half a chanco to get husbands in England; that's tho reason. Why, one of 'em was telling mo that, out of 100 women folks in her native village between tho ages of 20 and 35, there were husbands for only 66 of 'em. Fourteen of tho other 54 had owned husbands once, but they had died. Tho remaining 30 never had any, and had no hopes of getting any. Sho seemed to have made a study of tho question, for sho told mo that there wcro less than .four million wom6n be tween 20 and 40 years in all England and Wales, and of them nearly two mil lion were unmarried. So when tho En glish women learned about Utah, and tho glorious opportunities it afforded them in a marital way, they became im pressed with tho placo at once; and that's why they keep coming over with tho Mormon missionaries. N. Y. Sun. Against Insects. Scie)iee has an amusing paper upon lawsuits in tho olden times against grubs and caterpillars, and dwellers in the Jersey marshes may well wish that such could be enforced against mosqui toes. A jurist of tho seventeenth cen tury takes up tho subject of such pro ceedings with calm gravity, and enters a protest against tho want of legal ac curacy in the measures taken. He de clared himself pained by the lack of knowledge displayed bv the advocates of excommunication. Very amusingly he concludes his protest by tho follow ing words, "But of what use is all this against disgusting beasts?" Still ear lier, in 1471). a great plague of grubs having devastated tho fields in Switzer land, an advocate was selected by the Uishop to pronounce an anathema on tho part of tho people against tho ob noxious insects. Thus it ran: "Ye hideous and degraded creatures! Yo grubs! There was nothing like yc in tho ark of Noah. I command yo one and all to disappear, during the next six days, from every part where fc grows for tho use of man. If not obed ient, I enjoin you to appear the sixth day before tho Archbishop." Then a Erocess began and judgment was given y tho Archbishop of Lausanne, 'who excommunicated the grubs with much unction and condemmed "all of them except such parts as can be useful to man." A llemarkable Kyeslglit It is recorded by Humboldt that ho was traveling in Sout h America under conditions which rendered it necessary for the party to divide, and to reach their destination by different routes. As Iiv and those who remained with him approached the appointed meeting dace, ho said to the Indian guide that ic wondered what had become of tho others. The guide looked at him with tome surprise, and pointing across a wide mountain gorge, one side of which they were traversing, replied: "There they are." Humboldt himself could see nothing but rocks and verdure, but ultimately, being assisted by tho guide as to' the position of tho other Early, succeeded in discovering them y the aid of a telescope; and then, by making the guide describe the order of march and the relative position of the several individuals, obtained proof that he actually saw them plainly with his unaided eyes. An experience of equal significance, if of a less striking char acter, may be had in any Highland deer forest, where deer, which aro con spicious to the eyo of the keeper, can only be seen with difficulty and un certainty and after much pointing out of neighboring land-marks by visitors who are habitual dwellers in towns. In other words, tho acutcness of sight of tho average citizen is much inferior to that of the average Scotch forester; while the acutcness of sight, of tho forester is probably much inferior to that of the savage. People arc too prone to accept this as something necessary or inevitable, and to think of the forester or the savage as the pos sessor of some special acutcness wfiich has been conferred upon him by train ing and practice, instead of thinking of the citizen as n person who, by reason of unfavorable , circunutaneos, falls short of tho acutcness of vision which he ought to possess. London Tin'cs. "Suppose," said an examiner to a student in engineering, "you had built an engine yourself, performed every part of the work without assistance, and knew that it was in complete or der, but when put on the road tho pump would not draw water, what would you do?" "I should look into the tank and ascertain if there was any water to draw," replied the student. A physician of Brighton, England, hit upon an ingenious method of mak ing himself popular among tho middle aged ladies who visit that watering place. Until his idea took possession of him, and he carried it out, ho trudg ed on foot to his patients, who general ly resided in tho back streets in tho hilly part of Brighton, but now lie drives one of tho best broughams seen along tho King's road. This eminent gentleman announced thathehadmado a profound study of tho effects of tight lacing, and tho conclusion he had ar rived at was that for middle-aged la dies, especially under his treatment, tight lacing is positively beneficial both to tho health and tho complexion. He is now the fashionablo physician on the Mr. Blyth, of London, has a new plan for disposing of tho dead. It is to abolish all permanent cemeteries, and allow each pieco of agricultural land to take its turn as a receptacle for tho bodies of the dead. After live years as a cemetery, ho would uso tho ground for agriculture on tho theory of a ro tation of crops. Ho remarked in his argument that "beneath tho wavwig porn or tho stately pines the remains of the dead would bo forever free from desecration." 

WASHINGTON. Fortho first timo sluco July, lS7t, the moil t lily statement of tho nub! ie debt shows an Increase, mainly caused ty tlio disburse ments for pensions. Tho opinion prevails at Washington lhat the subieet of a revision of tlio tariff will be referred to a commission composed of r electecl members of the house, us recom mended by Secretary McCulloch. Secretary Lincoln reports that durln? the past year no soldier has lired a musket at an Indian. 1 In states tiliat constant hand lini? ot the" rolls In tho office of the adju tant general has made their recopyinif nec essary, a task which will require tho ser vices of one hundred clerks for tli roc years.

FINANCES. The annual report of United States Treasurer. Wy man shows that the revenues of the Government were less than in 18S8 by $49,767,712. The decrease In receipts from customs was 19,i;8'.),0O7, In receipts from internal revenue $28,134,296, and in receipts from miscellaneous sources $8,849, 248. From the aggregate of these items should be deducted an increase of $1,854,840 in receipts from tho sales of public lands, leaving the net reduction as stated above. The net expenditures aggregated $244, 13V 244 a decrease from the amount in 1888 of $21,281,898. The surplus applicable to tho reduction of tho public debt amounted to $104,398,625 a decrease of $28,485,818 from that of the previous year. The items of ex- enditures showing a decrease aro as fol ows: On account of tho War Department, $9,481,779; Interior Department, $11,409, 980; interest on public debt, $4,581,752. There was an Increase of $2,243,411 in the expenditures on account of the civil imd miscellaneous list and $2,009,164 in the ex penditures on account of the Navy Depart ment. Disbursing officers of the United States had to their credit on the books of the Treasury at tho close of tho year $83, 468,980. The statement of assets and lia bilities for Sept. 80, 1884, shows the general balance was reduced from $168,282,468 in 1X88 to $149,525,062 in 184 a reduction of $13,707,400. CIVIL-RKItVICE TEST. The civil-scrvico commission finds it is grinding oui: a supply of clerical material that is somewhat in excess of the demand. Therefore It will In future examinations re duce the number who pass successfully by being somewhat less liberal in tho marking. Tho minimum w ill not at present bo ad vanced from 6 per cent., but tho markers will bo a little more severe in tho credits they give. Therenilt will be to raise the average capac'ty of the list ofcligibles. The change will make it easier for persons well qualified for tho government service to get places, and a littlo more difficult lor those of inferior capacity. 'Ihc scholastic tests aro not severe, and one does not have to be a graduate ot Harvard, or even a re cent graduate lroin a high school, in order to pass; but lie has to have some capacity for thinking and exrios-dng himself. One of the regular tests Is the writing of a short letter on a subject named by the examiner. The subject Is generally an easy one, but knowledge ol' it is not required. The in formation and opinions in tue letter do not count. The sole object is to test the appli cant's ability to express himself. In a re cent examination a very intelligent-appearing young man gave up in despair, and re fused even to attempt -tho exercise. He said he never could write a letter, and it was of no uso for him to try. Though marked zero on that, ho might answer oth er questions well enough to get an appoint ment, but for the future tho examiners do not mean that a general average shall save a candidate who won't even try the difficult intellectual feat of writing a letter. TUB 

WHISKY MEN. Although there aro indications that an earnest effort will be made this winter to extend the bonded period for the benefit of persons who are carrying stocks of spirits, tho occasion for any such relief Is rapidly diminishing. Exportation has afforded some relief, and is now going on at the rate of about 20 per cent, above tho exportation for the previous vear. During the first sev en months of 1885, 24,617,593 gallons will have to be withdrawn, but during tho last live months of the year only 2,178,594 gal Ions will have to bo withdrawn, making 20, 781,186 gallons for the year. During the first oeven months of isSii, 13,900,109 gallons will have to be w ithdrawn. Tho total amount to be withdrawn in 1885 is less than 40 per cent, of tho average amount with drawn and tax paid, cxclimve of the amount withdrawn from export during tho live years 18SM. .So that with a restricted production for the next six months tho dif ficulties the whisky men havo been com plaining of for the last two years will bo iretty well over. The internal revenue mreau was favorable to tlio extension of relief to tlio distillers, but it is now believed in the bureau that the special occasion for relief has passed. If tlio tax on whisky i3 left undisturbed by the next congress, tho bonded period Is likely to bo made Indefi nite Tobacco does not havo to pay t ix till It goes on the market. The same was true of all the other articles on winch Internal revenue taxes wcro levied. The theory of the internal revenue system is to collect the tax when the goods are sold, mid to tills spirits have been tho only exception. If spirits could be bonded Indefinitely, distil lers could take full advantage of low prices in grain. This is one of tho first modifica tions of the internal revenue system that Is wanted m tlio splrit-produdiu region. THE NATIONAL HANKS. The annual report of tho comptroller of the currency shows that during tho year Nov. 1..1S84, 191 banks havo been organized, with an aggregate capital of $16,042,280. Circulating notes have been Issued to these new associations amounting to $3,8C6,230. These banks are located by geographical divisions as follows: Kastern states, 10 banks, with a capital of $810,000; middle states, 25, capital $1,812,250; southern states, 80, capital $2,991,000; western states, 103, capital $8,905,880; Pacific states, 5, cap ital $3so,oo0: territories, 19, capital $1,14:1, 000. Since tlio establishment of the nation al banking system, Feb. 25,1863, Micro have been organized 8,261 national banks. The total number In existence Nov. 1, ISM, is 2,671, tho largest number in operation at any one time. Eleven national banks.with an aggregate capital of $1,285,000, have failed and been placed in tho hands of re ceivers during the year. The different Items of resources and lia bilities, as tabulated indicate that (he busi ness of national banks during the past elev en years has generally Increased. The items of United States bonds and circula tion thereon have decreased during the past two years. The aggregate liabilities of na tional banks to depositors and correspond ents were reduced timing the year upwards of $94,000,000. This reduction of liabilities and tho general reduction of loans by banks, which amounted to over $03,000,000 during the year, the comptroller says, was doubt less occasioned by financial troubles in May and a general depression of business. Dur ing the same period the national banks In creased their cash resources by about $21, imnccAIn nnrrln. and Xlt.0rju.000 In leal tonnes ana uniiou Mates eei lineal es or ue posit tor the Baine. The total number of banks still in operation, organized under the act of June 8, 1864, and provisions of the Keviacd Statutes and their periods ' of suc cession, which will terminate, unless here after renewed during years previous to 1900, is 1,4-8, with a capital of $321,461,145, and a circulation of $194,74:J05. IUI.I.H IlKKOUE CONGItESS. The following bills relating to tho tariff aro awaiting consideration In committee of the wholo in tho house, having been favor ably reported by the committed on ways and means: To amend the act to prevent tho Importa tion of spurious and adulterated goods. To abolish the discriminating dutyon wrti ks of art by foreign artists. To refund duties upon goods on ship board when tho tariff act of March 3, 1888, went into effect. To modify existing laws relating to du ties on imports and the collection of the revenue. Tho last-named bill is the one prepared at tho treasury department and reported by Mr. Hewitt, of New York, June 25. . Tho bill to carry into effect the Mexican reciprocity treaty is also on the calendar. The McPherson bill, which authorizes na tional banks to issue circulation equal to the par valm of bonds deposited, passed the senate, Feb. 20, and is on tho speaker's ta ble; but a bill in identically the same lan guage is No. 33 on the house calendar. If at any timo a motion should prevail that the house go into committee of the wholo on revenue bills, tho first one to be taken up would bo Mr. Green's bill for the relief of fruit-growers, which repeals the tax up on fruit brandy. The consideration of tills would involve discussion of tho whole in ternal revenue system. The modified and amended Lowell bank ruptcy bill passed the senate at the last ses sion and lies on tho speaker's table. Its. opponents admit that a majority of the house is in favor of the bill, and ft will bo passed if it can be readied In due course on the calendar. This is unlikely, and the op ponents of the bill are numerous enough to prevent a suspension of the rules in its be half. There Is small prospect, theretore.of its passage. 'the Hoar bill to regulate the counting of the electoral br.llot Is also on the speaker's table, and while tho democrats do not es pecially object to it they will certainly not pass it at the present time. Tho next con gress will not have tho same excuse for ig noring tho subject, but tho next election will then be too far off to mako tho elector al vote a matter of interest. At tho begin ning of an administration neither party can be induced to take much interest in the presidential count. Just before a general election, or the casting of the electoral vote, one party or tho other is sure to be afraid of any chanare. The bill which Mr. Eaton, of Connecticut, offers as a substi tute for the Hoar bill could not get through the house even, and the senate would never discuss it. 

CONGUKSSIONAI. SENATE. Dec. 1. When the senate was called to order, the secretary read the credentials of William P. Sheffield, appointed by the gov ernor of Khode Island to fill the vacancy caused by tho death of Henry D.Anthony. Mr. Cullom introduced two bills in regard to retirements from the army, and one to light navigable rivers by means of electric ity. Mr. Ingalls offered a resolution to bring about tlio removal of fences illegally constructed on the public domain. Mr. Hoar introduced a bill to givo Dakota two new supreme court Judges. After the read ing of the President's message the death of Mr. Anthony was unnounccd and tho sen ate adjourned. Dec. 2. In the Senato Mr. Vest offered a resolution directing an investigation into all leases of lands in Indian Territory tor grazing or other purposes by Indian tribes; the number of acres embraced in said leas es, their terms, and the persons or corpora tions becoming lcs?es. Also, all circum stances under which the leases were made, the means used in obtaining the leases, and whether they are authorized by law. Mr. Vest said Ik had information that these leases were obtained from Indians by corruption, fraud, and bribery, and that some Jndian councils hail been infiuenced by the wor.-t practices of civilization. Mr. Vest criticised the course of tho Interior Department in protecting such leases, they being, he claimed, in direct contravention of the Kevised Statutes. Mr., Da wes.said ; these leases of Indian lands, while wrong, were no more outrage ous than tho authorized inclosure by wire fences of thousands of acres of public lands. Of one tract of 1(2,003 acres of Indian lands, 85,000 acres were in exclusive posses sion of outsiders, whose herds consumed ev erything that grew on It, while tho Indian Bureau had been obliired to advertise for beef to support the Indians on whose res ervation theso herds were feeding. Had the Indians used ihc re-ervatlon for them selves they would havo supported them selves. In ono instance tho Indians had lu one year sold 17,000 bushels of wheat from a reservation now occupied almost entirely by private individuals, without any power on the part of the Government to dispos sess such individuals. The evils consequent on leasing Indian lands and fencing in pub lic lands, Mr. Dawes continued, imposed a grave duty on Congress. If remedial ac tion were not taken in time tho public do main would pass Irrecoverably into the pos session of largo land-owners, foreign and native. He hoped the matter would not'be allowed to end in talk or be confined to In dian lauds alone. Congress had the power to clothe the executive officers of tho Gov ernment with ample authority in the pre mises, and should do so. 

HOUSE. Dec. 1. The house of representatives commenced business with 2-J2 members in attendance. Mr. Shevely was sworn in for the Thirteenth Indiana district, Mr. Cal kins having resigned. A bill making tem porary provision for tho navy was reported by Mr. llutchins. An ad journment follow ed the announcement of the deatn of Messrs. Duncan and Evans. Dec. 2. Tho houso adopted a resolution presented by Mr. Follett. of Oliio, for an in vestigation int the conduct of Lot Wright, marshal at Cincinnati, and his deputies at the October election. Mr. lteasan offered as a substitute for the bill reported by the Committee of Commerce last'season. the bill generally known as the llcagan bill, and entered into an exhaustive comparison of tlio two measures. Under tho committee bill, lie said, tho liability of a railroad corporation to any person suffer ing wrong by its action was actual damages sustained, while under the substitute it was liable for three times the amount of dam ages. Tho bill of tho committee did not I irohibit discrimination in freight charges, ml the substitute prohibited companies from charging more lor a shorter than for a longer distance for the same quantity of freight. The substitute gave complete legal and equitable remedies to a citizen for ev ery Injury, without delay nnd through tho courts of the country. The committee's bill failed to do this. Another great im provement in the substitute over the com mittee bill lay in the fact that, while the latter directed the commission to inquire into tho method of pooling, and to report what legislation was needed on the subject, the former absolutely prohibited such pool ing. FOllKION. The French senato has passed a bill abol ishing public executions. A court In IiOiidon refusal to grant an in junction to restrain the Great Eastern from sailing for New Orleans. The national council of Switzerland elect ed M. lloessel president of the republic and M. Bezzola vice president. The late duke of Brunswick bequeathed to the duke of Cumberland an Iron safe in ids villa at Heitzing, which was found to contain coin and currency to tho amount of $500,000. The French chamber of deputies voted Tonquin credits aggregating 59,000.000 francs, which will permit the sending of V 000 fresh troops and several cruisers. Dur ing the debate Clemenceau said Bismarck Is a most dangerous enemy, but is still more dangerous as a friend. t!!imiuuiiULUi....,.....:. ...:::.::!
