CO. Tin: Philadelphia news Ih author ity for tho Htntcmciit thnt "tho democratic Coinmitteo has returned to Mr. Cleveland liln $10,000 check." In Mexico public Bentiment does nut limit tho term of tho president of tho nation to' two torniH. l'roai dunt Diaz on Saturday took tho oath of ollicc for tho third term. Tin: UHoof upon tio water dur ing u storm, to prevent tho heavy homh front, breaking Is growing in favor, and al vessels liavo been ad vised to provide themselves with thin h tfeguard. Ah usuaij, "tho worst wlorins over known" aro reported from tho Eaut. It la Foveral years since Eastern winters bankrupted language, and itisnow a eloso race between the bllzztinN and mutliematles, with tho olianees In fuvor of tho blU-zitrdn. Pit. Tvsim.in'Y, wlio Is suspected of tho Whltoehapel atrositles, has arrived in New York from Havre. Inspector llyrnus had two men at tho pier when Tunibloty ar rived, who traced him to his board ing hoiiBo. Thoy will keep him under surveillance for kouIu time. Mycologists tell us that Minerva threw away her ilutc when she found It pufled up her cheeks; but If In this age we cast away the flute lb 4s otfly to take ,up Borne more oolsterSua 'installment, The pen- I'mefa as avclass, however, are willing tojk'JutJllHo'Miticrj-a iii'the rhatftr of "cheek," if any inflation of tllis feature will give greater volume to the notes of their trumpets. But remember, young men, there Is a greater distinction between ' niere .hollow trumpeting aud self, adver tising that is proclaiming to the world what you really 'can do. The sum of the whole matter Is, self confidence nulkis ability available; and e'ven riiorc; it frequently leAds to the possession of the quaUtfcs only a't first uf-sumed. A man of meager powers held up and pushed forward by this principle will ofteil nerfcWm a L'iatit's labors, while with out It the noblest Intellect will' ck- nelid Itself In thd trivial wdrk of a d Willi", aud be ccllpfecd by inferior talellt, endowed With 'llltle merit beyond that of mere assurarJce. You cannot expect the worjd''tb cramor for your services while you sit dreaming with your arms fold' ed in secluded 'comers. If, you feel yourself qualified to' fill the position you would like, strike out and as sert yourself. Tho'tyorld Is to busy to dig for' diamonds Ih tlie rough, when so many pollslied ones nre to be found on every hand, rut your self forward If you would be known. Blow some kind of a horn, or at lpast a penny whistle, to draw the public's eyo upon yon; but bo dure you aro what you pretend to bo be fore you turn on tho wind. l'.OlTOKIAr. 

C'OMMKNTS. Tin: Post editorially 'says: "The President's message of last Decembei' gave tho country a surprise' by Its' oomnese, aim 1110 present win no hardly less. Jfthat pottlon of tho 'message which treats of tho commu nism of capital gives a shook to tho capitalistic class it is precisely what thoy need." Tlie Commercial Advertiser (Inde pendent) says: "Tho message is n notuble State paper, and will profita bly direct popular thought, aud, if Congress is not wholly given over to mere partisan wrangling it will aid lu securing wise legislation in tho noxt Congress." Tho Mall and Express says: "On tho whole we think most Americans will bo glad as thoy read this mes sage that it Is tho last ono which will elnanilto from tho present chief magistrate." An editorial in tho Evening Sun (Dcm.) says: "Tho second bcsslou of tho Fiftieth Congress met at noon to-day to explain how Itgotbounced by tho American people Tho pris oner at tho bar said Unit American Justice was moro honest than elo quent. God lias given him a. gopd constitution mid sense, instead which you go about tho country stealing ducks, alas, for any Con gross that has a good chance and wastes It by stoning ducks, or chas ing rainbows, or conducting an ed ucatloual campaign."
