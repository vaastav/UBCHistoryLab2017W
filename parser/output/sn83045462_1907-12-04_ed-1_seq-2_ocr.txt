England Not Disturbed. 6p?cl*l Ctblrffrim to The St*r. LONDON. December 4.?The foreign of fice regards Marquis Aoki's return at this juncture as merely a coincidence. It is not viewed with anv alarm. Indeed the foreign office Is taking very little notice of the matter. SENATOR PILES, PROBABLY. He May Go on the District Com mittee to Succeed Mr. Allee. Senator Samuel Henry Piles of Wash ington will probably be the new repub lican member of the committee on the I>lstrict of Columbia to succeed J. Frank Allee of Delaware, who is no longer a member of the Senate. Senator Piles wag elected to the Senate January 28, 1905. to succeed A. G. Foster, and his term of of fice will expire March 3, 1911. Since coming to Washington he has evi denced a great deal of interest in local affairs. For over twenty years he has re sided in the city of Seattle and for a large part of that time has been engaged in the practice of law there. He has al ways been deeply interested in municipal ahairs and has taken a very prominent part lo the government of his home city. From 1887 to 1889 he was assistant prose cuting attorney for the district composed of King. Kitsap and Snohomish counties, and in 1888-80 was attorney for the city of Seattle. These are the only offices which Mr. Piles ever filled or sought be fore his election to the Senate. No city in this country has grown any more rapidly within the last twenty yeara than Seattle, and Senator Piles has been in close touch with this growth and in fact has played one of the most promi nent parts in it. While, of course, the action of the re publican committee on committees to be appointed by Senator Allison cannot be forecasted with respect to the vacancy on the District committee with absolute cer tainty, it Is. nevertheless understood at the Capitol that Senator Piles has asked for and will get the assignment. Senator Piles is chairman of the com mUi.ee on coast and Insular survey and a member of the committees on Canadian relations, commerce, pensions, territories. Pacific islands and Porto Rioo and the committee to examine the several branches of the civil service. There Is nothing at present to indicate who will be assigned to fill the three dem ocratic vacancies on the committee. MAY 

REAWAKE CRITICISM. Another Coin Appears Without "In God We Trust." Another of the Roosevelt-St. Gaudens coina?minus "In God we Trust"?has Just made its appearance, and will in all prob ability create great criticism. It is the double eagle, or twenty-dollar gold piece, a much handsomer coin than the $10 coin that has caused so much furor. For forty years, however, the reverent motto has appeared on the twenty-dollar gold pieces. and It was not until St. Gaudens drew the design leaving it off, and the President approved it. that the mint un dertook to depart so far from precedent. The obverse side of the new coin contains the figure of the Goddess of Liberty, holding in her right hand a torch and in her left an olive branch. Above her head Is the word liberty and near her feet Is the date 1907. Down In one corner Is ths dome of the Capitol, barely discernible. The reverse aide contains an eagle flying In the air?this time without trousers, as in the 110 coin?and above the bird are tha words "United 8tates of America. Twenty Dollars." Around the edges are "E Pluribua Unura" and stars. The mint bureau is much better satisfied with the new coin than with the last one. A number of bills are penoing in Con gresa to restore "In God We "iruat" to American coins. TO

THE 

SENATE AND HOUSE | | Committees to Work Together to Perfect a Bill. ALL HAVE SOME OBJECTIONS Perhaps, However, Out of the Lot There May Be- Ideas <m Which Agreement Can Be Made. Congress ha# settled down to an at tempt to solve the currency problem. The House committee on banking and cur rency was appointed yesterday by Speaker Cannon, and the Senate committee on finance held its initial meeting. Hard work is ahead of both committees, and no man can foretell what the outcome will be?nor when. Tllere are sir general propositions for the relief of the currency situation which have been advanced from various sources. Among them a choice will be made?per haps. There are a score of other sug gestions, and undoubtedly more will be forthcoming as discussion in Congress and the press proceeds. The six leading plans which have been advanced may be summarized popularly as follows: The Central Bank of Issue. This is a suggestion which originated with the New York Chamber of Com merce. and has the indorsement of that body. Tt is favorably entertained by some prominent senators and representa tives, and will be freely discussed. It authorizes the organization of a central bank of issue, capitalized at not less than $30,000,000, which will carry a large gold reserve. This bank will be custodian of the government reserve of metal. It will act as the government's agent in re deeming all kinds of money, and as its receiving and distributing agent. It will perform the functions now delegated to the subtreasuries. The bank is to be owned In part by the government, by other banks and by private stockholders, but the government Is to have control and ab solute management. American Bankers' Association. The plan which has been indorsed by | the American Bankers' Association con templates an "emergency" credit cur rency. It permits any national bank which has been going for a year and which has a surplus of 30 per cent of Its capital, to Issue additional circulation notes in amount equal to 40 per cent of Its bond-secured circulation. This is to be done without putting up security, but the issue is to be subject to a tax of 24 per cent per annum on the average amount outstanding. If necessary, it may issue a further amount, up to 124 per cent of Its capital, subject to a tax of 5 per cent. i The Asset Currency Plan. j This Is also a recommendation of the New York Chamber of Commerce. It provides that any national bank whose bond-secured^ circulation equals 90 per cent of lta capital stock may issue addi tional circulation equal to 65 per cent of its capital, subject to a tax ranging from I per cent to ? per cent. | Mr. Shaw's Proposition. j Mr. Leslie M. 8haw, former Secretary of the Treasury and now president of the Carnegie Trust Company In New York, favors an "emergency" currency circula tion. He would authorize national banks to Issue additional circulation up to SO per cent of their capital, without deposit of security. Jft order to assure its re- I demptlon when the emergency which called Jt forth had passed he would Im-1 pose a tax of 5 per cent upon the Issue. I Treasurer Treat's Idea. j This It opposed to the credit currency I system. It contemplates bond-secured emergency notes. It would authorize national banks to issue SO per cent of their circulating notes on security other than government bonds. This clrcula-1 tion would be regarded as emergency circulation and would be compulsorily re tired In four and six months from Sep tember 1 of each year, after the crop moving demand had been satisfied. The Credit Currency System. This would authorise national banks to issue additional circulation with tbelr "credits" as security. That Is, to con- l vert bank book credits or deposits sub. I Ject to checks Into credit currency. j The foregoing are the essential prop osltlons for currency reform over wblch the lawmakers differ. Each plan has Its advocates, and in the opinion of op ponents. each has Its weaknesses. Bank ers themselves are wide apart in opin ions and there Is wrangling and dissen s.on among them th? extent to which conservatism ought to be exercised and the amount of laxity which might be permitted without endangering the sta bility of the national bank currency, j Bankers Widely Divided. j A very striking illustration of the di versity of views among bankers is fur nlshed by the Wall Street Summary, a' financial publication, which is making a poll of the banks of the country on their choice of these propositions for currency reform. The second day's returns show ed replies from 'J88 banks, scattered all over the country. The answers were di vided as follows: For the central bank 00; for the American Bankers' plan, $7* for the asset currency, 12; for the Treat plan. 18; for the 8haw plan. 35; for the credit currency. 4; declined to answer, 24. In addition to the foregoing, sixteen "other plans" were suggested by the bankers And the polling has Just be gun. Meeting of House Committee. The House committee on banking and currency met today for the first time since Its reorganization. Before the com mittee was called to order Chairman Fowler stated that the only object of to day's meeting was to permit the old mem bers to get acquainted with the new ones and possibly to briefly discuss the situa tion In an Informal way. He declared that he had no financial bill in prepara tion. Contrary to general expectation. Sena tor Aldrlch. chairman of the committee on finance of the Senate, will not intro duce a currency bill. His plan is to re ceive all suggestions for currency legisla tion. to lay them before his committee and to have them fully discussed, in or der that the committee itself may frame a bill which may be reported to the Ben ate. The House committee on banking and currency, which was appointed by Speaker Cannon yesterday, whs In session for several hours today, and during that time had a general free-for-all exchange of views on the present financial situation, the needs of the government in the way of financial legislation and the Important phases of the various remedial proposi tions which have been put forward. The only action taken by the committee was to authorise Chairman Fowler to appoint a subcommittee of five to draw up a bill to be reported back to the full commit tee as quickly as possible. This bill. It is understood, will embody currency legislation desired by the admin istration and Congress leaders. Mr. Fow ler sa'd this afternoon that he had not yet selected the subcommittee. a?d would not make announcement of the names un til this evening or possibly tomorrow. It is understood that Representative Bur ton of ohlo. formerly chairman of the House rivers and harbors committee of the Fifty-ninth CongY-ess and now a mem ber of the banking and currency commit tee, win be one of the subcommittee mem wrs. 

MANY BILLS INTRODUCED REPORTS \ND PETITIONS RE CEIVED BY THE SENATE. Immediately after the prayer of the chaplain the Senate today began routine Business by receiving a large number of reports from tha executive departments. This order of business was followed by the presentatl6n of many petitions and the introduction of innumerable bills bearing upon all conceivable subjects. Senator Frye was the first to secure th? recognition of the Vice President for the introduction of bills, and he was followed in rapid succession by most of the other members of the Senatei Senator Jefferson Davis of Arkansas, who recently was quoted as saying that he would make, a speech the first day after his admission to the Senate, failed to koep his word exactly, but he gave notice today that he would speak on the lith instant on a bill which he presented for the abolishment of trusts, pools, etc vmftur Jh* rearIln* of the titles to the 1 Progressed for some time Sen ator 1 illman made an effort to relieve the Senate of the tedious routine by suggest ing the application of the Senate rule per mitting senators to withhold their peti tions and bills until after the morning hour, and then hand them to the clerk without formality. He said such a pro cedure would answer all the purposes of senators. This suggestion, however, did not appear to be taken with favor, and the dull routine continued. A vast major ity of the-bills were private pension meas ures, and many of them were bills which had failed of success In former Con gresses.

HUNDREDS OF DELEGATES Opening Address by the Secretary of State. HATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY Speaker Says American People Stand Squarely Behind the Improve ment of the Waterways. ^ ith every state in the Union, as well a-i Alaska and Hawaii, represented, and with tho broad object of promoting1 the improvement of inland waterways, the fourth annual convention of the national rivers and harbors congress was opened tor a three days' session here today. The meetings are being held in the ballroom of the New Wlllard Hotel, and the ca pacity of even that great hall Is taxed to afford accommodations for the hundreds of delegates in attendance. Fully 1500 members of the congress were assembled In the hall when President Joseph E. Ransdell's gavel fell for the opening at 10:37 o'clock this morning, and more are coming into the city on each train today. It is expected that fully 3,000 delegates will be registered and participate in the discussions and the adoption of resolu tions looking to the extension of the ob jects of the convention. Delegates from subsidiary organizations, from trade associations and civic bodies, all seeking expression of their views on the national policy regarding the work of providing navigable streams and deep water harbors to accommodate the ship ping Interests of the country and of the world, mingled with the individual dele gates and formed part of the gathering that crowded the New Wlllard. The movement is national in scope, and has for Its object the securing from Congress of larger appropriations for the Improve ment of the Inland waterways of the United States. "Not less than $r<0,000.000 a year for waterway development"' is the slogan of the delegates. Particular emphasis was laid on this object of the association by President Ransdell In a brief address at the open-1 ing of the convention. Railroad Interests Represented. Railroad interests are represented in the congress toy James J. Hill of the Great Northern railroad and W. W.. Finley of the Southern railway. Governors Hoke Smith of Georgia, Cummins of Iowa, Johnson of Minnesota, Deneen of Illinois, Folk of Missouri, Warfleld of Maryland and Dawson of WeBt Virginia also are on the list of speakers. Other governors who will be present and probably make ad dresses are Glenn of North Carolina, Cut ler of Utah. Mead of Washington, Gil lette of California, Klbby of Arizona, Guild of Massachusetts and Cobb of Maine. The Washington Chamber of Com merce in represented in the convention by the following delegates: President Robert N. Harper, Norman Gait, Chapin i Brown. John Weaver and Allen D. Al bert. Delegates from the local Hoard of Trade include M. I. Weller, chair man; Thomas W. Smith, Scott C- Bone and E. D. Shaw. Addressee this morning were made by Ellhu Root, Secretary of State; M; Ju's serand, the ambassador of Trance; Francis G. Newlanda, United States Sen ator from Nevada, and' member of the inland waterways commission: Joseph E. Ransdeli, representative from l^ouis iani and president of the congress, and Martin S. Knapp, chairman of the In terstate commerce commission. Gavel for Presiding Officer. Before the congress formally convened President Ransdeli was presented with a sliver-mounted gavel by the Upper Mis sissippi! Improvement Association. Presi dent Ransdeli In opening the congress referred to the work of the national ad ministration in promoting trade relations between America and foreign countries, particularly those countries lying to the south of the United States,' and referred In complimentary terms to the achieve ments of Secretary Root of the State Department In promoting those relations. He then presented to the congress the Secretary of State. Secretary Root was received with great applause, the delegates rising to greet "It is a great pleasure to me to extend to you a welcome from the national ad ministration," Secretary Root said, "and i pleasure to note your entrance upon the duties you have to perform iri the National capital. I can assure you of the sympathy and support of the admin stratlon for the great interests you are seeking to subserve. The attitude of the idminlstratlon toward rivers and har bors has been a subject of much mis understanding. It seems that the inhabi tants of each section of the country un derstand but little the needs of ? other sections. Ideas are taken from the most cursory glances at the headlines of the i^wsoape^s. "Now it is time that something should be done. Something positive and com pelling public attention. Making the pub lic understand that this movement Is no mere bartering of interests between poll policy8" ,S a gFeat matter ot Public Prepared a Veto Message. Secretary Root related an Incident of a rivers and harbors bill of which he had prepared a veto message while he was Secretary of War. That bill was not passed, but was talked to death in the Senate. He said that if the measure had been vetoed it would have been not be muse the proposed improvements were unjustified,' but because of the proposed improvement of certain mountain streams which President McKinley believed was net warranted. This irrigation scheme, the Secretary said, was sought under color of river and harbor improvements. He felicitated the convention on the fact that the river and harbor bills of this day were relieved of temptations of the kind referred to. He spoke of the able and devoted work of Representative Bur ton of Ohio, the chairman of the rivers and harbors committee, whose achieve ments had been of the most able and painstaking character. j Continuing, the Secretary said that the policy followed by the United States must be considered truly as a policy and not as a project. He referred to the construction of the Panama canal and to the improve-1 ment of the Erie canal as Instances show ing that the American people stand I squarely behind the improvement of wa- f terways, and he expressed the hope that they would assert that policy in the fu ture. Time to Cross Bridge. "In your last convention," Secretary Root added, "there was some reference that we should not cross a bridge until we reach It. We now have reached the bridge. There Is no greater achievement than the transportation of articles which are value less at one point to another point where they are valuable. The railroads of the country no longer are able, physically, to carry the traffic of America, and the one avenue open to such traffic is water trans portation. Wo must move forward or we will go backward. This particularly ap peals to me because I am interested in the promotion of the foreign commerce of America. I see American production hand icapped by two things: First, the groat cost of getting the goods to the seaboard and, second, the absence of an American merchant marine. ' Secretary Root made an appeal for farii ltles to get American products'to the American seaboard and for the upbuilding of such an American merchant marine as would be able to carry America? products to the uttermost parts of the earth. Work During Past Tear. At the conclusion of Secretary Root s Gov. Post of Porto Rico Gives Satisfactory Explanation. 

DINNER TO BEAR HUNTERS Quite a Gathering to Be There Fri day Night. PROHIBITION IN DISTRICT Representative Campbell Thinks That the People Here Ought to Express Their Wishes. Gov. Post of Porto Rico has triumphed over his enemies. He has told his side, of certain remarks to the President and the latter ha* decided that the governor is all right. At any rate, Mr. Post's name Is to be sent to the Senate for confirma tion as governor. Gov. Post was charged with having made some vicious remarks about the school superintendents and mis sionaries In the Island, accusing tljem of retarding progress and standing in the way of the Island administration. A Porto Rican newspaper, edited by a P0,ltlcal enemy of Gov. Post, spread the alleged remarks all over the island, and charges ^ followed. An investigation was mad# by Secretar> Garfield and other government officials, and tyr. Post came here and made an explanation. His statement to the Presi dent was that his remarks had been gar bled and greatly exaggerated, and that they had been made at a private house and tn a private conversat.on. He did not attempt to deny that In his talk lie said that mistakes had been made by mis sionaries and by the school superintend ents, but he did deny that he had said some of the things attributed to him. Al though settled at the White House. It Is presumed that the tight will be carried to the Senate. Dinner to Bear Hunters. Bear hunters of great renown will feastat the White House Friday night and .rehash the storied of their adven tures* The dinner, so far as official In formation goes. Is a great mystery. Among those who will be present are John M. Parker of New Orleans, whose guest the President was on the recent Louisiana bear hunt; Harley and Cllve Metcalf of Greenville, Miss., members of the same party; Dr. Alexander Lam bert of New York and Surgeon General Rixey, also participants In that mem orable occasion; Cecil Lyon, republican national committeeman from 'i exas, a member of the party that hunted bear with the President in the Colorado mountains, with several others whose names are not known. John Melihanny, civil service commissioner, was a mem ber of the Louisiana party, but he Is on his wedding trip and cannot be present. According to an Alabama dispatch there will probably be plenty of bear meat for the hunters. A fat bear was shipped to the President from Mobile a few days ago and is now on Its way here by express. The animal weighs about 200 pounds, and Is expected to get here by tomorrow after noon. It was killed In southern Alabama. Let the People Vote. Representative Campbell of Kansas, a prominent member of the House District committee In the last session, believes that If the prohibition question is to be forced to an issue at the coming session the best .thing to do will be to let the people of the District decide by vote what they want. "No law of this kind should be forced upon a people without their beingr permitted to decide for themselves," said Mr. Campbell. "Prohibiton was not brought to Kansas until after a vote and It will be nothing but fair that 'Washing ton people shall express themselves. The difficulty about this, however, will be In defining who Is entitled to vote. I sup pose that can be arranged, though. Vice President and Methodists. Vice President Fairbanks introduced to the President a number of distinguish, ed Methodists, headed by Dr. Herbert Welch, president of Ohio Wesleyan Uni versity. The visitor* last night organ ized a Methodist Federation for Social Service, which has for its object the application of Christian principles to so cial and industrial life. The organiza tion proposes to do considerable slum work. Inheritance Tax Problem. Representative Perkins of New York, who lias given much study to Inheritance tax problems and the necessity for em ployers' liability legislation, discussed these subjects for some time with the President today. "Just as sure as we are living.'' said Mr. Perkins, "legislation providing for in heritance tax will be enacted by Con gress. It may not come this year or even next year, but It will come. So will legislation providing for liability of employers in case of injury to employes. In both these matters we are far behind avery country of Europe. Germany, to instance, takes away from the courts the settlement o.r damage suits growing out of injuries sustained by employes and fixes the liability of employers. ? i'he United states is the only country without an Inheritance tax. I Introduced a bill in the last Congress providing for such a tax and will Introduce It again. The suggestion is made that taxation of Inheritances should be left to the states, but this would mean no uniformity. My Idea Is that Congress should enact a law providing that where states tax inheri tances the national government will de duct fifty per cent of Its tax. This would have the effect of making state laws on this subject uniform. We will say, for Instance, that the United States taxe6 a five million inheritance at twenty per cent. Should the Inheritance pay tax In a state there would be deducted ten per ;ent. This would induce every state to provide a uniform rate of taxation." National Committee Reception. Members of the republican national committee, which Is In session here, will be received by the President Friday aft ernoon at 2:30 o'clock. Some of the mem bers of the ^ommlttee were visitors at the White House today. Harry New of Indiana, chairman of the committee, ac companied by Secretary Dover, Gen. Powell Clayton of Arkansas, Solomon Luna of New Mexico and Cecil Lyon of Texas, were among those at the executive offices. A large number of senators and repre sentatives called at the White House to day to pay their respects. Some of them had visitors, while others were alone. Representative Davis of Minnesota In troduced C. M. Buck, president of the Citizens' National Bank of Faribault, Minn. Mr. Buck talked to the President about financial matters, and the Presi dent expressed the belief tte^t Congress would pass satisfactory currency legisla tion at this session. For Collector at New York. The President today sent to tha Senate the nomination of Col. Edward S. Fowler to be collector of castoms at the port of New York in place of Nevada N. Strana nan, resigned. Collector Stranahan of New York re signed his position because of 111 health. It was with great reluctance that the Treasury Department accepted h:? resig nation, and only upon his insistence. During the eighteen months Col. Fowler has been appraiser of thj port he has given an administration that has been satisfactory alike to the business Inter ests and the business rnen of the port of New York. He has been energetic, watch ful and fair.

Sensation in Caleb Powers' Trial in Kentucky. , 

VICTORY FOR THE DEFENSE Damaging Evidence Repudiated and Thrown Out by Conrt. AFFIDAVIT WAS A BOMBSHELL Entire Court Journeyed to Frankfort Today to Inspect Scene of (foebal Murder and Points. , Speci?l Diflpatrb to Tbe (>t?r LEXINGTON", Kv? December There was no session of court in the Caleb Pow ers trial at Georgetown this morning, the Jury having been taken to Frankfort on a special train at 10 o'clock to inspect the scene of the murder of Goebel and the location of various points. The whole court made the trip. The taking of testimony was resumed this afternoon at 2 o'clock. The most startling event of the trial so far came last night when Robert Noake, star witness for the prosecution, had fin ished his testimony, at which he con nected Caleb Powers with the plots to as sassinate Goebel. The defense Introduced an affidavit' by Noak*. made at D*nvi:ie. III.. December 0. 1008, In which he swore that the testimony he had before g'.ven In the Powers case, which was similar to that given yesterday, waa wholly false and had been secured by bribery and In timidation brought to bear on him by Thomas C. Campbell of New Tork. chief attorney for the prosecution, who etarvod to death In the Bahama Islands two years ago, and by Arthur and Justus Goebel, brothers of the rourdersd senator. Noaks in this confession swears that there was absolutely no truth in his testimony against Powers, and that Powers knows absolutely nothing about the Goebel killing. Noaks further sa>s witnesses were corralled by CampbtU an<1 Goebel on a farm near Marietta, Ohio, and there coached on what to say. Statement Refused Jury Last Trial. Judge Robbins. at the last trial of Powers, refused to allow the statement to go to the Jury, claiming It was not prop erly witnessed, but yesterday Judge Mor. rls admitted the statement, and it was read to the Jury. Noaks had during the morning yester day given testimony similar to that at former trials, making his statements somewhat -stronger, in that he said yes terday that he had told his men, under instructions from Charles Flnley, Caleb rowers and John L. Powers, that they were to go to Frankfort and hang the members of the state election commis sion unless the republicans got Justice; that Flnley had asked him If two of his men could be depended upon to kill ,i man, and that Flnley nad said tbe beet way would be to get Jim Howard to kill Goebel, which would end the oonteet. Bombshell Effect. The introduction of this affidavit pro duced a bombshell effect In the camp of the prosecution. They were frtn*led In their protestations that It be-not admitted to record, but Judge Morris admitted it. Noaks wilted like a wet rag when this affidavit was introduced, and beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead. The defense then placed Noaks on the stand and forced hhn to admit that the statements made in the affidavit were true and that his testimony of yesterday was wholly false. Noaka admitted he hed lied. Powers then took the st#nd and Identi fied the affidavit as original. The securing of this affidavit oif record was the greatest victory Powers has ever won during his four trials, and wholly ruins Noaks' testimony, so far aa its wee to the prosecution la concerned, and pre duced one of the greatest sensation* of all the trials.
