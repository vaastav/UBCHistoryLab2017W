' ' The first annual messageof President G rant was read to tlic two Houses of Congre33 on Monday week. It is much more lengthy than we had anticipated, and is, for the most part, an exceedingly common-place document. \\ e append such portions of it, as relates to qucs- j tions in which the people and the couutry generally, are most direc ly interested, with out indulging in further comment: ? THE 

LATE REBELLION AND ITS EFFECTS. Emerging from a rebellion of g'gantis mag nitude, aided, as it was, by the sympathies and assistance of nations with which wo were at peace, eleven States of tlie Lnion were, four years ago, left without legal Stuto govern ments ; a national debt had been contracted ; American commerce was almost driven from the seas ; the industry of one half of the coun try had been taken from the control of the capitalists, and placcd where all labor right fully belongs?in the keeping of the laborer. Tlia woik of i rsf ofitiK St;;(>v<?rM 1 "1 to the Union , of protecting and fostering free labor, and providing means for paying the interest on the public debt, has received ample attention from Congress. Although your ef forts have not met with the success in all par ticulars that might have been desired, yet on the whole they have been mere successful than could have bccu reasonably anticipated. Seven States which passed ordiuanccs of se cession have been fully restored to their places in the Union. The eighth, Georgia, held an election, at which she ratified her Constitu tion, republican in form, clected a Governor, members of Congress, a State Legislature and all other officers required. The Governor was dulv installed, and the Legislature met and performed all the acts then required of thrill by the reconstruction acts of Congress. Sub sequently. however, in violation of the Con stitution which they had just ratified, as since decided by the Supreme Court of the State, they unseated the colwied members of tlie Legislature and admitted to seats some mctli b.t's who are disqualified by the-third clause ; of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Consti tution. an article which they themselves had contributed to ratify. Under tbeso circum stances I woulii submit to you whether it j would not he wise, without delay, to enact a j law authorizing the Governor of Georgia to convene the members originally clcctcd to tl.c Legislature, requiring each member to take tho cath prcscribeil by the reconstruction aefs. and none to he admitted who are ineligible i under tho third clause of the Fourteenth j Amendment. The freedmon, under the pro tcctiou which they have received, are making : rapid progress in learning, and no complaints j are heard of lack of industry on their part j when they receive fair remuneration for thcii j labor. Tho means provided for paying the interest on the public debt, with all other expenses of Government, arc more than ample. The. loss <f our commerce is tho only vesult of the late rebellion which lias^ cot rccjivcd sufficient attention from you. To t his subject I ealLyour earnest attention. I will not no^t suggest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if ncccssary. make it the subject of a special message during the session of Congress. At the March term Congress by joint resolution authorized the Executive to order elections in the States of \ irginia, Mississippi and Texas, to submit to them the constitutions which cacli had _ previously. in convention, framed, and submit the constitu tions, cither entire or in separate parts, to l.e j voted upon at the discretion of the Executive. Under this authority elections were called ? j In Virginia the election took place on the Gth | of JulyTlSCn. The Governor and Lieutenant j Governor elected have been installed. The j Lepi-lature met and did all required by this resolution, and by all the reconstruction acts of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful aittlior'tTy. I recommend that her Scnatovs j and Representatives and that Stale be fully restored to its place in the family of States, i Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas to commence on the 30th of November. 1SG0. and to last two days in Mississippi and four days in Texas. The elections have taken place, but the result is not known. It is to be hoped that the acts of tho Legislatures of these States, when they meet, will be such as to receive your approval and thus close the work of reconstruction. THE CURRENCY. Among the evils growing out of the rebel lion, and not referred to, is that of an irre deemable currency. It. is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest attention. It is a duty and one of the highest duties ol I Government to secure to the citizens a medium of exchange of fixed unvarying value. This implies a return to specie bnsis. and no sub stitute for it can be devised. It should he commenced now and reached at tho earliest ^practicable moment consistent with a fair re gard to the interests of the debtor class. Immediate resumption, if practicable, would not be desirable. It would compel tho debtor class to pay beyond their contracts the pre mium on gold lit tho date of their purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and ruin tothous atids. Fluctuation, however, in the paper value of the measure of all values, gold, is detrimental to the interests of trade. It makes the man of business an involuntary gambler, lor in all sales, when further payment is to bo made, both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be paid and received. Srr.CIE PAYMENTS. I earnestly reenniuieuJ to you, then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments, and put an immediate stop it is not desirable that the people should bo taxed 4o pay it in that time. \ear by year the ability to puy increases in a rapid ratio, but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly a3 can be done without the violation of contract. The public debt is represented in great part by bouds having from xfiva? to Twenty, and from ten' to forty Jfcarf to run. bparing interest at the iale of six j or ccut. aud five per cent, ^respectively. It is optional with the Goverumrut to pay these bouds at any period after the expiration of'"0 loist time mentioned upon their face. The tiuiu has already expired when a great part of them may ba taken up, nudj'is rapidly ap proaching when all may be. It is believed that all which arc now duo uiay be replaced by bonds bearing a rate ol interest".not exceed in" four and one-half per ccut., aud as rap idly as the remainder becQmc due that they may bo replaced in the same way. T>J ac complish this it may be necrssary to authorize the interest to ba paid at either of three or four of the money centres of Europe, or by any assistant treasurers of the United States, at the option of the holder of the bond. I su2"C*t this subject for the consideration ot Congress, and also simultaneously with this the propriety of redeeming our currency, as be fore suggested, at its market value at t.ie time the law"goes into cffc ct, increasing the rate at which currency will be bought and sold from day to day or week to week, at the same rate ?n,laiCr^c%utV(& ation will ticccssarily receive your attention. The revenues of the country are greater than the requirements, and may with safety bo re duced ; but, as the funding of the debt in a 4 or 4i per cent, loan would reduce the an nual current expenses largely, thus, after fuu din'*. justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would"be now expedient, I sngsest the postponement of this question until the next meeting of Congress. It may be advisable to modify taxation and tho tariff, in instances ( where unjust or burdensome discriminations i are made by the pres. nt laws, but a general revision of the laws r< gu'ating this subject I recommend tho postponement of for the pres- j ent. I also sucgcst the renewal of the tax on incomes, but at "a reduccd rate, say of 0 per cent., and this tax to expire in three years. I With ihc funding of ihe natioual debt, as hero suggested, I feel sale in saying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduccd safely from SGO.OOO.OCO to S80 000,- ! 000 per annum at once, and may be still fur- j ilicr reduced from your to year, as the rcsour j ccs of ibe countiy are developed. RESOURCES OF THIS COUNTRY. The report of the Secretary of the Trans ury shows the receipts of the Government for Ihe fiscal year ending June 30th, 1S8.), to be j $370,943,7-17, and the expenditures, includ ing interest, bounties, Sc., to be v?j_1,4J0, 597. The estimates for the ensuing year are j more favorable to ihc Government, and will, i no doubt, show a much larger decrease ot tUo public debt. Tho receipts in tho j rcasury I beyond expenditures have exceeded te amount necessary to place to the credit ol the sinking fund, as provided by law. lo' lock j up tho surplus in the Treasury and withhold ? it from circulation would lead to such a con traction of the curreucy as to cripple trade j and seriously affect the prosperity of thceoun- | try. Under these circumstances the . ecreta- ; ry of the Treasury and myself heartily con curred in ihc propriety of using all the sur plus currency in the Treasury in tho purchase of Government bonds, thus reducing the m tercst-bearing indebtedness of tlie country aud of* submitting to Congress the question of the disposition to be made of the bonds so j purchased. The bonds now held by U.e , Treasury amount to about S7o,000,000, in cluain" those belonging to the siukios lund. j I recommend that the whole he placed to the : credit of the sinking fund. our attention j is respectfully invited to the recommendations , of the Secretary of the Treasury for the crca- j tion of tho officc of Commissioner of Customs - revenue, for the increase of salary to certain classes of officials, and the substitution of in creased National bank circulation to replaco tl>e outstanding three per cent, certificates, and most especially to his recommendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines penalties, forfeitures. &c , Jo officers of the Government or informers. 1 he officc of C ou - uiissioncr of Internal Revenue is one of the most arduous and responsible under the Gov ernment. It falls little, if any, short of a Cabinet position in its importance and respon sibilities. I would a>k for it. therefore, such legislation as in your judgment will place t..e office upon a footing of dignity commensurate with its importance and with a character and qualifications of the class of men required to fill it properly. THE AI.AI5AMA CLAIMS. Towards the close of the last Administra tion a convention was signed at London for the settlement of all outstanding claims between Great ISritain and the United State?, which failed to receive the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification. The time and the circumstances attending the negotiations of that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance by tl e people of the United States, and its provisions were wholly inadequate for the settlement of tlie crave wrongs that had been sustained by this Government as well as by its citizens. The injuries resulting to the United States by rcasou of the course adopted by Great Britain during our late civil w.-.r. in the increased rates of insurance; in the diiuinu* tion of exports and imports and other obstruc tions to domestic industry and production ; in its cffcct upon the foreign commerce of the country ; in the decrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine; in the prolongation of the war and the increased cost, both in treasure and in lives, for its sup pression, could not be adjusted or satisfied as ordinary counccrcial claims whieh continually arise between commercial nations, and if the convention treated them simply as such ordi nary claims, frotn which they differ more widely iu the gravity of their charactcr than in the magnitude of their amount, great even [hat difference, not a word was found in )d rot an inference could be drawn 4vc the sense of unfriendliness Great Britain in our struggle f/which had so deeply and uni irc?sed itself upon the people of ^hat a convention thus mLscin scopff, and iaadeqnate in its pro Id not have produced the hearty, cuieut of pending question*, which istent with the relations I desire blished between the United States Britain. I regarded the acticn of the Senate, ia rejecting the treaty, to have been wisely taken ia the interests of pcace, and as a necessary step in the direction of a perfcct and cyrdial friendship between the two countries. ; A sensitive people, conscious of their power, are more at esse under a great wrong wholly . unatoncd for. than under the restraint of a i settlement which satisfies neither their ideesof ? jtiSiicc nor their grate sense of the grievance : they have sustained. The rejection of the treaty was fallowed by n state of public feeling, , ou both sides, which [ thought not favorable pto au immediate attempt if renewal of nego j Nations. I accordingly so instructed the Min | later of the Uuitcd States to Great liritaic, i .and found that mv views in this regard were j shared by Ilcr Majesty's Ministeis. I hope j that the time may soon arrive when the two j Governments can approach dissolution of this j momentous question with an appreciation cf what is due to the rights, diguity and honor I of each, anil with the determination, not only I to remove the cause of complaint in the past, but to lay the foundation of a broad principle | of public Jaw, which will prevent future dif i ferenccs, and tend to firm and coutiuued peace and, friendship. | Ihis is now the only grave question which i the United States have with any forei"n nation. | the president's policy. I .v& Qi* asking the responsible duties of I I I Jlagistrata ?i the United States, it was with th" conviction that three things were es j sential to its peace, prosperity and fullest de [ velopmeut. First among these is strict in tegrity in fulfilling all our obligations. Seo | ond?To secure protection to the person and [ property of the citizen of the United States in each and every portion of our common cauntry, wherever he may choose to move without reference to original nationality re ligion^ color or politics, demanding of him only obedience to the Jaws and proper respect ! ? ',,,e J'sI,U ?f ?tl,0!"3- Third?Uuion of all the States, with rqual right3, indestructi ble by any constitutional means. To secure the first of these,"Congress has taken two es sential steps; first, in declaring by joint res- I oiution that the public debt should be paid, j principal and inteiest, in coin; and second.' | by providing the mcati3 for paying. Pro- ; vtding the means, however, could not secure j the object desired without a proper adminis- ! (ration of the laws fur the collection of the , revenues, and an economical disbursement of ? them. To this subject the Administration has most earnestly addressed itself, with re- ' suits I hope satisfactory to tho countiy. SWArri.NG 

CABINET OFFICERS. There has been no hesitation in changing officials in order to secure an efficient cxecu" tion of the laws, sometimes, too. where in a mere party view undesirable political results were likely to follow, nor any^hesitation in sustaining efficient (flicials against rcmoa- ' stranees wliol'y'political. TIIE TENURE OF OrFICE~ACT. It may be well to mention here the embar- ' rassment possible to arise from leaving on the statute books tho so called tenure-of-office acts, and to earnestly recommend their total repeal, it could notjbave been the intention I of the frauiers of the Constitution, when ! providing that nppointmcuts made by the I'rcsidcut should receive the consent of tho ! Senate, that tho latter shculd have the pewer to retain in cfliee persons placed there by Federal appointment against tho will of the ! President. The law is inconsistent with a ' faithful aud efficient administration of the j Governoieut. What faith cau the Kxecutive put in officials forced upon him, aud those, j too, whom he has suspended for reason ? ' IIow will such officials bo likely to serve an Administration which they know does not 1 trust them ? For the second requisite to cur growth atid prosperity, time aud a firm but hu- f uiane administration of existing laws, amended j from time to time, as they may prove ineffee- , tive or prove harsh and u a necessary, are prob ably all that arc required. The third cannot ' be attained by special legislation, but must be legardcd as fixed by the Constitution itself, and gradually acquicsccd in by force of public opinion, from the foundation of the Govern ment to the present management of the orig inal inhabitants of this continent. 

SALARIES OF GOVERNMENT OFFICERS. I desire respectfully to call the attention of Congiess to the inadequate salaries of a uum- j bcr of the most important officers of the Gov- | eminent. In this mescagc I will not enumerate ; them, but will specify only the justices of the Supreme Court. No change has been made iu their salaries for fifteen years. Within that time the 1 !bors of the Cuurt have largely in creased, and the expenses of living have at least doubled. During the same time Con press has twice found it necessary to increase largely the compensation of its own members, and the duty which it owes to another De partment of the Government deserves, and will, undoubtedly, reccive its due considera tion. COXCLLSIOX. There are ninny subjects not alluded to in ibis uicssag} which might Lo with propriety introduced, but 1 abstain, believing your pa triotism and statesmanship will suggest the topics and the leui-lation most conducive to the interests of the whole people. On my part I promise rigid adherence !o the laws and their strict, enforcement. U. S. Grant, President. JtfEWSPAPKES.?The following wo extract from a long article on newspapers :?
