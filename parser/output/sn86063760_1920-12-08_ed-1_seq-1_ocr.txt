C., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1920 N 1 PRESIDENT WILSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE READ TO CONGRES Independence of Philippines and Loai to Armenia Among Recommenda tions-Wants Budget System an( Income and Profit Tax Laws Sim plified-Has Faith in Democracy Washington, Dec. 7.-President Wil son's annual message to Congress to day follows: When I addressed myself to per forming the duty laid upon the Presi dent by the Constitution to present ti you an annual report on the state o the Union, I found myself dominate< by an immortal sentence of Abrahan Lincoln. "Let us have faith that right make: might, and in that faith let u sdare t< do our duty as we understand it." A sentence immortal because it em bodies in a form of utter simpliciti and purity the essential faith of thi nation, the faith in which it was con ceived and the faith in which it ha: grown to glory and power. With tha faith and the birth of a nation foundet upon it came the hope into the work that a new order would prevai throughout the affairs of mankind, at order in whi&i reason and right wouk Uke p.recedence of covetousness an( force, and I believe that I express thi wish and purpose of every thoughtfu American when I say that this sen tence marks for us in the plaines manner the part we should play alik< in the arrangement of our domestii affairs and in our exercise of influ 'en-e upon the affairs of the world By this faith and by this faith alone can the world be lifted out of thi present confusion and despair. It wa: this faith which prevailed over thi wicked force of Germany. You wil remember that the beginning of th< end of the war came when the Germat people found themselves face to fact with the conscience of the world an( realized that right was everywhere ar rayed against the wrong that thei1 government was attempting to perpe trate. I think, therefore, that it i: true to say that this was the faitl iwhich won the war. Certainly this it thelfaith with which our gallant mei went into to field and out upon th< seas to make sure of victory. Mission of Democracy This is the mission upon which De mocracy came into the world. De mocracy is an assertion of the right o the individual to live and to be treate< justly as against any attempt on thi part of any combination of individual! to; make laws which vill overburde, him or which will destroy his equal ity among his fellows in the matter o rigth or privilege, and I think we al realize that the day has come whet Democracy.is being put upon its fina test. The Okd World is just now suf fering from a wanton rejection of th principle of democracy an(d a substitu ,ion of the principle of autocracy a. usserted in the name, but without au thority antl sanction of the multitude This is the time of all others whet dlemocracy should Prove its purity an< its spiritual power to Prevail. It it surely the manifest destiny of th( U~nitedl States to lead int the attempt t< make this spirit preCvail. 'There are two ways in wvhich the United States can assist to accomiplisl this great object: First, b~y off'ering. the example within her ownm bordern of the will and power of democracy t< make and enforce laws wvhichi are un. questionably just and which are equa in their admninistratont, laws which se cure its full right to labor and yet a: the same t imae saflegua~ird the integrty Of property, andl partcularly of thal property which is devoted to the deC velopmoent of indhustry andl the increas of the necessary wealth of the worb Second, by standing for right andl jus. tice as toward individual nations. Th< law of dlemocracy is for the prtectiot of the wveak, an~I the influence of every democracy in the world shoulh be fo rthe priotect ion of the wveak tn. tion, the nation which is struggling toward its right and towardl its priopei recognition and privilege in the faim. ily of nations. The Unoited States "an, Rt refuse this role of champion with. out putting thte stiymta of reject im upon the great and devoted tmenm wh<i brought its govertnmen(It in to existenc< and established it in the fact of al most universal opposit ion andi in. ttrigue, even in the face of wantom force, as for example, against th< ordetrs in council of Great Britain atm 1arbitrary Napoleonic decrees which in olved us in what we knoam as th War of 1812. I urge you to considei that the display of an immediate dis position on the part of the Congres to remedy any injustices or evils that may have shown themselves in oui own national life will afford the josi effectual offset to the forces of chaos and tyranny which are playing so (is astrous a part in the fortunes of thi free peoples of more than one pait o the world. The United States is 0: necessity the uample democracy of th< world, and the triumph of democrac3 depends upon its success. Serviceable Acts of Legislation Recovery from the disturbing an< sometimes disastrous effects of the lat< wari has been exceedingly slow on th< other side of the water and has givei promise, I venture to say, of early completion only in our own fortunat< country; but eve nwith.us the recovery halts and is impeded at times and there are immediately serviceable act6 of legislation which it seems to mc we ougth to atteipt, to assist that recovery and prove the indestructibc recuperative force of a great govern. ment of the people. One of these is to prove that a great dlemocracy can keep house as successfully and in as business-like a fashion as any other government. It seems to me1 that the first step toward proving this is t( I supply ourselves with a systematic I method of handling our estimates and expen(litures and bringing them to the I point where they will not be an tin I necessary strain upon our income 3r necessitate unreasonable taxation; in other words, a workable budget says tem, and I respectfully suggest that two elements are essential to such i system; namely, not only that tile pro posal of appropriations should be in the hands of a single body, such as a single appropriations committee in each house of tile Congress and also that this body should be brought into such cooperation with the departments of the government and with the treas ur'y of the United States as would enabel it to act upon a complete con spectus of tile need of the government and the resources from which it must draw its income. I reluctantly vetoed tile budget bill passed by tile last session of the Congress because of a constitutional objection. Tile House of Representatives subsequently nodifie( the bill in order to meet this objec tion. In tile revised forni I believe that the bill could with action al ready taken by the Congress to revise its rules and procedure, furnishes the foundations for an effective budget system. I earnestly hope, therefore, that one of the first steps tiken by tile piresent session of the Congress will be to pass the budget bid. The na1ltiol's finances have shown mllarked imlprovelent during tile past t yeor. The total ordinary receipts of $6,694,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920 exceeded those for 1919 by $1,542,. 000,000 while the total net ordinary explen(litures decreased from $18,514, 000,000 to $6,403,000000. The gross pulic debt, which reached its highest point On August 31, 1919, when it was $26,596,000,000 had dropped on Novem her 30, 1920, to $24,175,000,000. 'ihere haks also been a marked decrease in hoild ings of government warLI securities b fy tile banking institutions of the( counltry as well als in the amlount of bills held by thle federal reserve bianks secured by governmen(It wa~ir obliga tionls.

SENDS FROM Mr. Editor: For some time I have been think ing I Would write a letter for the columns of your valuable paper; but just about the time I reached a de cision as to wyhiat my subject would be conditions financially would be so changed that my subject would be inappropriate, so I have decided to scramble up my subjects together and write something any way. In the outset we want to picture a man with a long face, a downward look, really looks like he was born in crab-apple time and pickled in vine gar; and, allied with thi man, is a great brnch of followers romping up and down the country crying out: ."Hard times. Abusing high officials in our government and declaring that our country is going to the (logs if something isn't done quickly to re lieve the financial situation, all of which may be true. But if the above is true let us look around and see what brought about such a condition of afTairs: After making a survey of the situa tion, say, for the past three years we find that many of our people imagiln ed themselves rich and well to do and didn't give a doggone whether they worked any more or not, money was plentiful and the majority were on a ihigh horse and preaching to ourselves and others that what we had to sell would always be high, and at the same time, appealing to the authori ties in Washington as well as filling the newspapers and street arguments for a reduction in the cost of living. Nonsense, how in the name of the Lord could the stockraisers and wheat growers andl others who could not grow cotton and cot.tonseed buy our commodities at a sky high price and give us their products at a low figure? Inconsistent, impossible; but as a re sult of such opinions and arguments lands lay idle, an( industrial plants lay idlle, when as a matter of fact everything should have been running in full blast placing the manufactur ed goods on the market at a high *price whereby many would have been benle fitted. Now to draw a picture to offset all I have said above, let us picture a man vith a shining face, a happy ex pression and a broad smile peddling sunshine into every nook and corner of the American continent and crying out: Plenty of work to do suflicient funds to pay with. Whereby every sane man or wvoman can make a live lIihood ant1d let every man and woman, boy and girl who believes in keeping the wolf away ally themselves with this man and we don't give a doggone about high priced cotton, lumber or anything else we have to sell. Either cheap butt-meat or blue hominy or anything else we have to buy if' we will just allow ourselves to get busy and quit looking for obstacles we will soon find that we are inl il atmos phere of what. was spoken of by King David, "Trust in the Lord, do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed." TheIre are many other things we woul love to mention, but for feat of asking you too much space we will end this chapter on the above subject. In spite of the fact that in the latter part of August and on tbrotigh the first part of the fall it appea red that this section of the country was infest ed with billions of boll weevils and the farmers were very m-ih afraid that their cottoll rops would e(- con siderably reduced, has proved to the Contra ry. Up to this date about six thousand bales of cotton have been gin ned here m id hot h gioneries are still rutnnin~g on fuill time. A inumber' of tields arec still whtitec withth the ecy staple anid it is a certainty that this yeatr's cotton crop in this sect ion will be fat' ablove the ave'rage.

John Hunsucker, Bismarck Godwi, Ernest Walker and Luke Ridgill spent Sunday afternoon and evening in Suniter as usual. The Northwestern railroad people are placing new ties up and down their road for rebuilding purpose, and it is understood that the light rail now used, will be replaced with a much heavier rail in the near future which is very encouraging news to the patrons of this road. Mr. C. L. Godwin spent Sunday in Scranton. We would like to say in conclusion soil-thing about the Summerton graded and high schools. Professor Gist Gee and his eflicient corps of teachers; but to make a long story short, I believe I can repeat a story I heard about a man and his sweet heart who went to a rifle range to see the soldiers practice rifle shooting: When the rifles began to rattle the young man became somewhat excited and fell against his sweetheart and exclaimed. "O please excuse me," She replied quickly: "0 that's all right, let's go where they're shooting can non.'' When Prof. Gee took charge, of the school here and found the need of an . up-to-date library and the beautLiyming of the play ground and fel back on the patrons of the school with his common voice and raised a little excitement with one or two shows, oyster suppers, etc., he shook u1) enough entihusiasmn and loosened up enough "kale" to almost accomliis What was planned.

Washington, Dec., 6.-Representa tive James F. Byrnes, of Aiken, to day introduced a concurrent. 'esolu tion in the House requesting Secretary; of the Treasury louston to cause the xVar F'inance Corporation immediately to resume its functions. A similar resolutioni will be introduced in the Senate by Senator Gronna of North Dakota. A concurrent resolution does not reqiuire the President's signature. Senator lloke Smith today intro duced an amendment. to the federal reserve act specifically providing for the rediscount by regional reserve banks of (otton factors notes. lie said he had no doubt that the act now authorizes such rel discount, but the Federal Rteser'e Board has rl to the contrary. On the general subject of the reserve Ibank rate, Senator Smith made the following statement for publication: "A iiumber of Sen:Itors have been in con ference considering the propriety of a rosolution directing a -1 per cent rate for the regional reserve banks. It is very probable that this resolution -will be introduced in a few days. I believe all the Senators from the cotton growing States will favor it. We are seeking lea-lership f'or' the loveient from Republicans in order to strengthen our fight." Washington, Dec. 6.-Revival of the War "Finance Corpora tion and action by the Federal Reserve Board periiit ting extension by banks of "liberal" credits to farmers would be dir cted in a joint resolition drafted late totday by the Senate agricultural committee. The resolititm will be reported to be Senate tomorrow by Senator Gromm. of North Ibakota, the agricultural committee chairman, who will ask for immediate consideration. Members of the committee drafting the resolution expressed con fidence that enough votes were assured to bring about its prompt passage, but members of the finance committee in. dicated that they would ask that it first be referred to them for consider atioii, iltSinmuch Is the War Finance Corporation was create under a bill drawn by their committee. Restoratiol of the War "iinance 'orioration to furnish financial aid to farimers also would be directed in a cICoicu rreint resolution presented todlay in the Hlouse by Representative 3yrne's Democrat, of South Carolina. The Senate agn euitural connittee decided to report its resolution as a Committee measure, hoping thereby to save time. With unanimous consent under the Senate rules the resolution -could be read twice in) 01te day a1l plaed on the calendar for pms.lge. Senator Norris, of Nebraska, a mem her of the agricultural coininmittee, first proposed a concurrent Iesolut ion which does not reqiire approval by the President, but other Ime inbers ohjertel on tle ginond that such a resoluition would not he strong enotigh.
