SNTEG (Reprinted from the Boston Post, Dec. 3.) In response to a request for his opinion on the report of the New Hampshire Public Service Com mission, which was made public earlier in the day, President Charlees S. Mellen said: "I have not had an opportunity to read the very voluminous report just submitted by the commis sion, and so I am not prepared to discuss the recommendations of the commission. "I have noticed, however, certain things in the report which are exceedingly gratifying, especially at this time, when there seems to be a renewal of the statements that the New Haven has not dealt fairly with the Boston & Maine, and a general agitation started against the New England railroad lines, which by false charges against the integrity of the management might become demoralizing to the railroad organization and harmful to the entire transportation and business interests of New -England. "It should be remembered that the Public Service Commission of New Hampshire has been inves tigating all matters relating to the Boston & Maine Railroad and its control by the New Haven for more than a year and has probed into every feature of rail road management. "On the question of the effect of New Haven control, the following statements are interesting: Particular attention was devoted to the divlion of joint rates enjoyed by the Boston & Maine Railroad and to the gateways of exchange on joint business with other carriers, and especially with the New Haven Company, to determine whether full advantage and fair treatment was be ', ing obtained by the Boston & Maine Railroad in those cases where it had the right to protect its long haul business and revenues. The result of these investigations it should be conceded, indicates that the acts of the New Haven Company, since its dominant control, offered little ground for criticism in this par ticular, as it appears that where new joint rates have been established the basis of division is sub stantially that of a strict mileage proportion, or, where changes in the routes have been inaug urated between the two systems, resulting in a shorter haul for the Boston & Maine, that the old divisions have been continued through the new gateways of interchange, and the Boston & Maine , has suffered no diminution of revenues. "In the light of charges which are being loosely made as to coal contracts and other purchases, the following statement is particularly significant: Special attention was given by the commi ssion to the contracts for coal supply, and al though it developed, there was a close interlockin g relation between those interested in the Vir ginia Iron, Coal & Coke Company, and the Keystone Coal Company and the New York, New Ha ven & Hartford Railroad or its officers, and that these two coal companies together held con tracts for 1,080,000 tons of the 1,500,000 tons needed to supply the Boston & Maine Railroad's an nual requirements, it appeared from the best ou tside information obtainable from those experi enced in coal business that both the terms and prices were advantageous and favorable to the railroad company. "The report further continues: "In general, however, it was found that all efforts by those in immediate control of purchases were being bent to secure the best and most economical results, and espe cially is this true at the present time."

Therefore, before the first accumulation of snow, it should be the resolve of every person responsi ble for a certain portion of the walk to maintain that portion in as good condi tion as at the present time. If not, what is the use of so much outlay in new walks? Smooth sidewalks covered witn snow and ice are no improvement over rough walks similarly coated. At least a third of the year the snow falls, and the city cannot afford to have its im provements nullified for one-third of the year. Let us resolve to show our appre ciation of the city's efforts by keeping the walk clear of snow. YOU CAN
