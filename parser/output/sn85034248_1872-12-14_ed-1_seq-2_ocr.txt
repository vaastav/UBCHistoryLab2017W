SCopies of the Cnuaz maiy alway be had Sthe Jost-O and at W'Vitnsoo's News MATUIRDAY, DEC.14, 1879. Men of mark-Those who can't write their names. Horse cars are once more to be seen upon the streets of New Orleans. The epizootic is rapidly abating. The veritable P. T. Barnum, of world-wide museum fame, will visit New Orleans during next week with his grand combination museum, men agerie and circus. Six monstrous tents are required for his exhibition, "and, ladies and gentleman, all can be vis ited for one price of admission." The New Orleans Times seeks to create the impression that great ex citement and indignation exist among the people of New Orleans over the political situation. Such is not the case. New Orleans has been very quiet all along. Her people have become accustomed to bloodless revolutions. Is it not a significant fact that in every parish where the result of the election was ascertained and com piled in the presence of U. S. Super visors Mr. Kellogg ran ahead of his ticket, while in those parishes where the federal Supervisors were ex eluded the opposite is the case t The last number of Harper's Weekly received contains a. supplement upon which appears a splendid pictorial representation of the burnt district of Boston. The picture is alone worth the price of the paper. The publishers of the Weekly promise a large portrait of the late Horace Greeley in the next issue. The Iberville News of last week comes out on the "lhalf shell," but its editor vigorously denies that the cir cumstance can be regarded as evidence that the lifoe of the News is waning. A lack of printing paper was the sole cause of the irregularity. We are glad to know that the spicy little News is to remain a fixture in the journalistic world, and will always welcome its weekly visits to our sanctum. We find the argument we u~ed against the legality of Gov. Warmoth's second coup d'etat-the promulgation of the amended election bill of 1872 also used by the New York Tribune. The ideas expressed by the CHIEF anid the Tribume re very similar, and in some cases the language of the two editorials is almost identical. Our article on the coup d'etat was published December 7th, that of the Tribune De cember 9th. Â«. No one can regret more sincerely than ourselves that the State Legisla lature should have found it necessary to impeach Gov. Warmoth in order to put an end to the political complica tions which surround the State Gov ernment and clog its machinery. We have often pictured a brilliant future, full of great struggles and triumphs, for Gov. Warmoth, and it is disagree able to have the anticipation so rudely blasted. -- . :.: ,, We rejoice in the re-election of State Senator T. C. Anderson from the Opelousas district. Mr. Anderson ran independently and outstripped both the regular Democratic and Re publican candidates. This is evidence of his great personal popularity among his constituents, and shows they ap prove of his past course in the Legis lature. Senator Anderson gives his adherence to the General Assembly in session at the Mechanics' Institute, and recognizes Pinchback as Acting Governor of the State. Jacob Hawkins, Esq., a member of the State Board of Returning Officers, has, been appointed by Governor Pinchback judge of the Superior Court of Orleans parish, a tribunal created by the Legislature a few days since to replace the abolished Seventh and Eighth District Courts. Mr. Haw kins is spoken of as a prominent, able member of the bar, unconnected with politics, and it is thought his selection for the important position he has been called to fill will meet with general approbation among the mass of the people of Now . rlean:s. THE POLITICAL MUDDLE I Gov. Warmaoth Impeached. Two Governors and Legislatures. Kellogg is Returned Elected. MILITIA AND POLIOE IN ARMS. Apprehemsloms of a Comniet. Uncle Sam Ready o Interfere. Miscellaneous EveuqtJ . It would take a readier pen than, ours to write a clear and complete statement of the various startling po litical incidents that have occurred at the State Capital during this week, and more space 'than we can spare would be required for the publication of such statement. A condensed sum mary of the more important events is all we can give. Saturday last the Board of Return ing officers decided to ie the legal board by Judge Dulell, issued a proc Slamation giving the result of the election so far as members of the Gen eral !Assembly was concerned, and these returns showed a large Repub lican majority in both Houses. On Monday the Assembly convened at the State House, and upon the refusal of Gov. Warmoth to recognize its or ganization, impeachment resolutions were offered in the Houseand adopted by a vote of 58 to 6. The Senate was organized into a court of impeach ment Monday evening, Chief Justice Ludeling of the Surpeme Court of the State presiding. The court adjourned to next Monday, when the trial of H. C. Warmoth for high crimes and mis demeanors in office will be com menced. The impeachment of the Governor of course made Lieut. Gov. Pinchback Governor pro teml. That official took immediate possession of the Gubernatorial office and. has re tained it since. After several ineffectual attempts, a number of the candidates for the General Assembly who had been de clared defeated by the legal Board of Canvassers, succeeded, with tlhe aid of a few bona fide members of the Assembly, in organizing another Leg islature at the City Hall. This body of course refused to recognize the acts of the other, and Warmoth coincided with them, so Louisiana was placed in a worse predicament than her sister Alabama, by having not only two Legislatures, but two Governors. Af ter holding a couple of sessions the Lyceum Hall body again found itself without a quorum, by reason of deser tions to its rival, and was compelled to adjourn, after a last appeal to the federal authorities for assistance and countenance. The Mechanics' Institute General Assembly pursues the even tenor of its way day after day, and shows some sign of accomplishing some legislation that will prove of benefit to the State. The assembly is recognized by the President and his Cabinet as the legal Legislature and Pinchback as Gov ernor. U. S. troops still guard the State House, and the commanding General has orders from the President to interfere with his force and quell any disturbance or riot. Gov. Pinchback removed Gen. Hugh Campbell, a Senator who clings to Warmoth and Lyceum Hall, from the position of Major General of the State militia and appointed General James Longstreet in his stead. Orders were issued to all officers of the militia force to yield obedience to Gen. Long street and turn over to him such arms and munitions of war as were in their possession. This demand was refused by the officers in charge of the ar mory in Davidson's court on Caronde let street, and the Superintendent of Police was ordered to proceed with a force of men and take possession of the armory. When the building was reached it was found to be garrisoned by a force of some three hundred militiamen, well armed, and surren der was refused. The Superintendent massed and armed the force under his command and placed them on guard around the armory, and our latest accounts find them awaiting orders to make an assault upon the beleagured building or to follow the more peaceful method of starving out the inmates. The only entrance of the court is guarded by two cannon shotted with canister, and the bold ' milish" say they will surrender to none but the U. S. soldiers. Uncle Sam's blue coats may interfere to lay and demand the surrender of the armory, but if they do not, bloodshed is not improbable. It is to be hoped the sacrifice of human life will be ivoided, and that the disgraceful po itical troubles of our suffering State will tlnd a peaceful en ding l.lFrtler intelligence from the State Capital will be anxiously awaited. Kellogg a"d the entire Republican ticket'bave been declared 'elected by majorities ranging from twelve to six teen thousand. The State is given to Grant, and the whole Congressional delegation to the Republicans. 0-0 Hon. W. A. Elmore, Judge elect of the New Orleans Eighth District Court, has been ranting around like a jack in a clover patch since his rather premature induction into his office. He has disregarded the mandates of the Supreme Court and issued injunc tions in defiance of an act of the Gen eral Assembly, and for these playful stretches of judicial authority has come to grief. On Monday he was fined and committed to prison by the Supreme Court for contempt, being barely saved incarceration by an Ex ecutive pardon. Following close up on the heels of this degradation came an act of the General Assembly abol ishing the Seventh and Eighth District Courts and creating in their stead a Superior Court, and investing Acting Governor Pinchback with au thority to appoint a Judge and Clerk of the new tribunal. Officeless officer Elmore remained defiant in spite of these rebuffs, and continued to grind out injunctions from his defunct legal mill. One of these bombastic and harmless orders was issued against Mr. Pinchback, directing him not to assume the duties of Governor, and another against Mr. Charles Clinton, seeking to frighten him from taking possession of the Auditor's office. Of course neither of the injunctions were obeyed, and when Elmore's deputy Sheriff sought to take the disobedient officials into custody the tables were turned and he was marched off to jail by the police. Pinchback isGovernor, Clinton is Auditor, Elmore an &xtin guished luminary. His career was a brilliant one, its brilliance being ex ceeded only by its brevity. He shot across the judicial heavens like a rocket, and disappeared as suddenly. We caution the victorious Republi cans of Louisiana that there is great danger of their present triumph prov ing their everlasting death, and this danger lies in an unscrupulous use of the power fate has thrown in their hands at a critical moment in the political history of their party. Let not the voice of the people be drowned altogether; let not representatives of the people who were fairly elected to office be denied the possession of the same because of their political opin ions; let not might take the place of right; for if this be done, the present political victors will find themselves shortly overwhelmed by the terrible and crushing force of popular opinion before which not even the almost in vincible blue coats and bright bayo nets of Uncle ram's soldiery can stand to defend them. If the Republicam will profit by the opportunity they are now given to redeem our State from her present deplorable condi tion, they will see the day they shall be blessed by those now loudest in denouncing them. It was characteristic of the New Or leans Times to bestow praise upon the legal ability, personal integrity, etc., of Judge Durell the day before his decision in the case of Kellogg vs. Warmoth was rendered, then turn round and abuse him in the most vio lent and obscene manner the day after. A more vacillating, worthless, venal sheet than the Times has never dis graced the journalistic profession in our State. From a bitter and unrea sonable denunciator of Gov. Warmoth it has transformed into his especial champion and supporter; and this at a time when the warmest friends and adherents of his Excellency-who defended him from the attacks of the Times and its kind-have been conl pelled to desert him because of his arbitrary official actions. The Times will always be found with its mouth wide open ready to denounce even suspicion of corruption among its en emies, yet the saintly and immaculate sheet can be bribed to the support of the mostiniqditons scheme imaginable. It has became notorious that the New Orleans Times is a blatant Falstaff of the press, a vendor of cheap brag gadocio and self-conceit, an assuming, hypocritical publication, a gross fal sifier of public sentiment and patent facts. Among decent and honest peo ple its abuse will prove more benefi cial to the person or thing abused than its praise possibly could, angi Judge Durell shows his appreciation of this fact by treating its slimy attacks upon his official and private character with silent contempt. These are not only our sentiments, but those of numerous others. Gov. Warmoth has been so unfor tunate in his course during the elec tion trPublu as' to provoke the al most universal condemnation of the Northern and Western press. Even the New York World and Bun, both of which supported the Liberal move.. ment, have naught but unkind words for him, the former advising the Dem ocrats of ,Louisiana to give him no countenance, the latter calling him an ambitious and unscrupulous carpet bagger. The President's message, which was transmitted to Congress on the` 2nd inst., is characterized by the leading newspapers an able review of the im portant events of the year and a bud get of wise suggestions for reformation of old and enactment of new measures. The document is of too great length to allow of publication in the columns of the 

CHIEF, else we should be happj. to present it to our readers in full. We 'solemnly protest in advance against the selection of James F. Casey as United States Senator to succed Mr. Kellogg. Mr. Casey's only claims to the position must be based upon his manipulation of the Custom-House patronage in favor of the Republican party, and his relationship to Presi dent Grant, and these are poor claims indeed. He is notoriously deficient in those qualities of mind and manner which should be possessed by an oc cupant of the exalted position to which he aspires, and the Republican mem bers of the General Assembly will re flect no credit upon themselves by giving him a seat in the United States Senate. For the sake of our State let the Senator elect be at least a man of some talent and brain, if he is a politician. When the Republican majority has such men as ex-Gov. Michael Hahn, for instance, to choose from, they will display a criminal folly in bestowing the Senatorial honor upon inefficient and simple minded James F. Casey. Peterson's Magazine for January, 1S73, is already on our table. Never was there a handsomer or better num ber. In spite of competition "Peter son" more than holds his own. It is hard to tell which of its two steel en gravings is the best, " Cherry Ripe" or "The Initials on the Tree," they are both so beautiful. There is a large-sized colored Berlin pattern for a sofa cushion, or foot-stool, in more than a dozen colors, which, at retail, would cost a dollar. The mammoth colored steel fashion plate is exquisite ; l3eterson is now the only magazine that gives these colored steel plates. The stories, as always, in this lady's book, are the very best. Two pow erful iovelets are begun in this numn ber. By all means subscribe to Pe terson's Magazine, that is, after you have subscribed to your local paper. The price is but two dollars a year, with deductions to clubs, and a five dollar engraving to those getting up clubs. Specimens are sent gratis. Ad dress Chas. J.
