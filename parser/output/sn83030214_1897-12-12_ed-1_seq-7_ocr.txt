.VANT TO BUILD THE ROAD. .J-J?RE? SYNDICATES INTERESTED IN THE RAPID TRANSIT SCHEME. J^PT TO BID FOR THE CONTRACT - THE PtCTSCHB BANK SUPPOSED TO BE CON KZOTED WITH ONE OF THE COM? PANIES- EXTENSIVE PLANS ALREADT MADE. farse syndicates are making active prepar 'lons BJ bid for the contract for the construction and ' Iteration of the underground rapld-tranalt rall- I j^sd, the plans for winch have been formulated t*y the Rapid Transit Commlaslon. One of these [ gjredkdtes ia said to be principally backed or rep- | ??jrtented by the Deutsche Bank, of Berlin. This j syndicate Is believed to have advanced much | further In Its preparations to make bids than either j ot the other two. Its reported plan is to deposit j UOOO/00 *w?th the United Statea Trust Company, to be drawn upon for the carrying out of the work, this ?um to be maintained by fresh de? posits when drafts are made upon It. Th* other tiro syndicate? whleh are actively preparing to mak* bids for the contract' are not known, but goisip In Wall Street Include? the names of J. < Pierpont Morgan as well as the Vanderbllt inter? ests 1n the scheme A representative of the firm , of J P. Morgan & Co.. however, said the firm had nothing to do with the underground scheme W. B. Parsons, chief engineer of the Rapid Tran f-ft Commission, said yesterday afternoon to a Trib? une reporter: 'Thera are three separate syndi? cates who have actively prepared to bid for the contract when bids aro advertised for, as they -gil] be If the Appellate Division of the 8upreme Court should decide favorab'.y upon the report of its Commission. One of the*e syndicates has gone ays ft*piStlfj?llT to work to retain counsel and en? gineering experts to examine the plans Charles Sooysmlth is their chief engineering expert, and he has examined the plans ani specifications in my office, and reported upon them to hi? employers. These employers ha\e been BO well satisfied with the report made by their engineer that they have taken suvh ?:eps that they will be able to proceed at i on^e upon the work if tha Commission should award the contract to them. They have obtained j bids upon various portions of the work from sub? contractors, and have awarded those contract? con? ditionally upon their receiving the main contract from the Commission. They have also made ar? rangements to secure the necessary bond?, and have agreed with the Carnegie Steel Company upon a price for the steel to be used in the work, although the price is considerably less than ?53 a ton. the amount ment.oned In some quarters. Thu? this syndicate s-.ands reidy to proceed to the work with small delay should It get the contract." tVISH TO KEEP IN THE DARK When asked who were the persons behind the three syndicates. Mr. Parson? replied that he really did not know. Inasmuch as those persons naturally wUhed to keep as much In the dark a* possible until they knew where they stood "The two syndicates other than the one whose methods I have described." continued Mr Parions, "have proceeded about their preparations In a different manner. They intend to make their bids, I believe, without going to tne length of letting their conditional BUb-contracts. leaving that for later developments. The persons securing the con? tract will n?"it have to use such an enormous amount of money as some people seem to think. The city will pay for the work. The contractors will have to deposit $1.000,000 to demonstrate their good faith. to ?.. ure the necessary bonds, to advance tha money for the equipment, and for beginning the work, but the finances needful are not ao enorfw?us as they have been represented to be in ioma quar? ters. But everything hangs fire now until the de? cision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has been made known. The Rapid Transit Commission has nothing to do until they get that decision. The plan? and specifications are finished and printed. Everything is ready for advertising for bids. But the public may rest assured that there will be responsible bids for the contract If the CommisMon's report is approved." CHIEFLY AMERICAN CAPITALISTS. Lewis L. Delaneld, secretary of the Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners, would say nothing with regard to the story, except that there would not only be a bid. but bids, for the contract, it is balleved by many, however, in Wall S:reet that the Deut.-, he Bank of Berlin is not at the bottom of any one of the syndicates, but will Rtand as trustee for prominent American interests. Mr. Parson? ?aid, In confirmation of this report, that, while he did not know anything about the individual makeup of the varlou? syndicate?, he had reason to believe that the men chiefly interested in the syndicates were Ameri, an capitalists. A B. Boardmaji, on? of the Commissions counsel, said that there was no doubt that a strong syndi? cate had been formed to bid for the contract and had eondl?ontlly let it? sub-contracts, as well aa made arrangements to secure the needful bonds in case tha contract should be awarded to it. Mr. Boardman doubted that the incomln;r municipal ad? ministration would be hostile to the plans of the Rapid Transit O-immiaaion. WORK OF C. SOOY8MITH. Charles Sooysmlth, who has prepared the estimate upon which one of the syndicate Is prepared to bid, snd who. if the bid is accepted, teil be the engineer of construction for that syndicate, said to a Tribune reporter last night, in answer to queries: ' It is true that for several month? I have been giving most careful study to the problem of an ac? curate estimate of what It will cost to build and complete the underground railroad ayetem aa ap? prove 3 by the Rapid Tranalt Commission. It Is true also that I ha\e been acting for a combination of men wbo propose to bid for the contract. All I can say now about this combination is that It In? cludes the necessary element? to con?truct ?uch a system as this, and also to take over and operate ? a.'-cr it has been built. In computing the prob? able cost I hav? trusted solely to my estimates, but have divided the work to be done Into a large num? ber of section?, and my negotiations have been con? fined to the most competent contractors in the coun t-y Each individual or firm ?elected to build theee sections has been chosen for his special fitness to do the work and to cope with the conditions on the particular section allotted to him From all of these men or firms so selected I have received the requinte evidence of their ability to carry our, prop? erly and expeditlously. the work awarded to them Thus I am confident that my estimate wl.l be auf Helen? for the whole work, and I am also con vlnced that If the members of the syndicate In whose behalf I am acting are the successful bidders the work of making the road will be done In the Bios; satisfactory manner." 'Being a competitive bidder, you would not. of course, give any hint as to the amount your syn? dicat? is prepared to expend, but may I ask If your estimate as to the cost of building the road comes within that of the Commission'"' was an inq'iiry addressed to Mr Sooysmlth by a Tribune reporter. ESTIMATES WELL WORKED Ol'T "I hardly like to say anything In that direction," Mr. Sooysmlth replied, but I can say that Mr. Parsons'? estimate of $35,000,(X?0 was well worked out. and I can say further that our bid will not be In exceaa of Mr Personas flg-irea." Mr Sooysmlth declined to make known the r.ames of those who form the combination. "Al? though I am wau aware," he explained, of the makeup of the syndicate. It ?loee not come within my province to allude to that part of the .*ch?me. Ail that I am willing to say In thl? connection i? that before joining the combination I satisfied myself that it wa? backed by bankers of the high? est sutiding. Charlea C. Beaman, of the well-known law firm of Evans, Choate St Beaman, haa appeared before the Commissioners as the representative of a syn? dicate of capitalist?., it la aald. who desire to bid for the raliway. Mr Beaman la said io have as? sured tha Board that hi? principals were men of high standing and were financially ?bia to carry through any scheme, no matter how great Its mag? nitude. But Mr. Beaman was entirely uncommu? nicative when he was approached last night by a Tribune reporter at his horn?-. No. li East Forty fourth-st.v "I am not prepared to say anything Upon the ?ubject." he ??id. "I am simply tho con? sulting counsel of a few men who are Interested In big constructions, such as the rapid transit run? way would be. More than mat I have no Informa? tion to give." John O. Stewart 1? the president of the Vnlled States Trust Company, and Edward D. Adams Is the representative of the Deutsche Bank. Both emphatically refused to answer any tnquirtaa laai evening. 

DOES NOT KNOW THEIR NAMES President Alexander E. Orr ot the Rapid Tr?n Slt Commission, when aeen at hie home In Brook? lyn, last evenina aa.d the Commissioner? had re? ceived requests from representatives of aavoral (troapectlve bidder? for .he contract for building the underground tunnel Mr. Orr denied, however, .liai he knew who tha applicants were, and added that be would not feel at liberty to give their Sames, even if he knew thora. "We think." be added, 'that they are people of responsibility . Ot tne visits the Commissioner? have received tra?? Pro?pr*.cHvo speculator? m the tunnel project, Mr. mt J. . *L w^?n?ver any person has expressed a de? sire to be informed of the general plan? for the proposed tunnel, with a view of bidding for the worn, we have requested our civil engineer to fur? nish ?very facility tor a thorough examination, ?nd to tell the applicant for Information all he wished to know. There Rave been several appll canta for auch Information. When we laid cut the previous route we also had several applicants for similar Information, and also invited many experts to give us suggestion? on our plans. We adopted the same course In making out our second plans. Some of those to whom we have explained our plans came en our general Invitation to look over our plana and maka ?ugtreRtiona. and so I am not able to say how many of thoae who hav? lnveatt gated the plans did so with the purpose of fur? nishing the information to persona ready to un?ler taka tn* work of constructing the tunnel TO 

HAVE AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE. "One of our object? In Informing engineer? and contractors and prospectiva sptculatora about our general plans waa to have as little delay as possible in calling for bids as soon as we have the permis? sion of the courts to proceed with our work. For six or eight months we have been furnishing In? formation on our second plan, and every little -while we would receive a new request. Out of this larg? number, wa knov that several parties are lookintc for Information with a view to bidding on the work. "If we now have a favorable decision from the Appellate Division, we can go on almost immedi? ately to advertise for the contract 1 am willing to say that we have reason to hope that we shall have more than one or two bids." Mr. Orr say? that several newspaper stories of conference.? he had held with prominent financiers on the subject of the contract for building the tun? nel were erroneoue. MARTINELLI GOING TO ST. PAUL. A STATEMENT THAT HE IS TO V1PIT IRELAND DENIED IN wASHINOtON. Rome. Dec. li.-The Vatican. It Is seml-officlally announced, has approved of Monsignor Martlnelll. the Papal Delegate to the Roman Catholic Church In the United States, visiting ireland for three weeks. It la pointed out that ?his approval is re? garded as a sign that Hlbernlanlsm Is reeaining favor at the Vatican. Orber signs of this are said to b* th? retirement of Monslgnor Schroeder from the University at Washington, and the high moral fiosltlon gained at Rome by Archbishop Keane, who s considered likely to be made a Cardinal Washington, Dec. 11-Monsignor Martinelli is not at present in the city, but it wa? said at the Papal Legation to-night that he has no intention of going to Ireland. The opinion was expressed that the statement from Rome grew out of the fact that Monsignor Martinelli. accompanied by Dr Rooker, hla Beemery, w11! go to St. Pau .

PRACTICAL STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY. DR MACVRACKXN 8 ADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF THE SCHOOLMASTERS' OTU**. The annual dinner of the Schoolmasters' Club of Naw-York waa held at the St. Deni? Hotel last evening Walter B <?unni?on presided, and among the one hundred and twenty-five who were pres? ent were the Rev. Dr. Henry M. MacCracken, chan? cellor of New-York University, George G. Ryan. Abner B. Holley. Charles A Dorsey, Martin H. Ray. Richmond R Elliott. Thomas 8. O'Brien. William C Hess and James Lee. After dinner Dr. MacCracken gave an address on the study of sociology In schools and collfc?. and recommended that in every high ??-hool and academy the students, at any rate those In the higher classes, be given practical Instru? tlon In social subjects. To do this properly It was neces? sary to study human activities at first han?l by means of visit? to Industrial and other en!irprls??s Pr. MacCracken suggested that the pupils devot" on? afternoon a month to this "field work." Half of the twelve afternoon? ?pent In this way during the year might bo occupied In \lsitlng humanity In Its normal condition, the other half In studying Its abnormal conditions. By normal condition, the speaker explain?,.* that he meant mill? an?l factories for men and women, the great exchange?, and perhaps occasionally club? and place? of amuse? ment I'nder the head of abnormal conditions would be included houses of refuge, prisons, ulms houses, hospitals, and schools for the deaf, dumb and blind. The members of these clisses should write reports on what they had seen, which should be read to the younger students. Dr. Mac'ra ?ken ?aid he thought that this system would result In immense gain to the students, by ptvlng them an insight into th<? conditions of modern life, and thTefore teaching them sociology in the most practical manner. After the address the subject was discussed by a number of those present. "IF YOU SEE IT IN 'THE SUN,' IT IS\T SO" From The Evening 8v*n The Hon. Whitelaw Reld'a new?p?p?r Inform? It? few readers that the P. and O. line meana "Pacific and Oriental." This does not demonstrate an ac? curate knowledge in the brick tower of either Mr. Kipling's works or the old overland route. [Once upon a time there wa? a little boy who ?aid: "My father and mother have both broth? ers and sister?, but I have neither uncle nor aunt." The simple explsnatlon of this mystery was that the little boy lied. So doe? "The Even? ing Sun." So does Its morning degenerate. If you see anything In either of them about any? body or anything they could have any motive for lying about, the presumption alway? is that they lie.]_ 

CURRENCY LEGISLATION IN THE SENATE. Senator Richard F. Pettigrew, of South Dakota, says that outside of the appropriation bills Con? gress wi.l enact practically no legislation this ses? sion. He came to the city yesterday to stay over Sunday, and Is at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. "Of course," he said, ' strenuous efforts will be made to enact some currency legl?lailon. but I do not think any bil) can pass, owing to the wide diver? gence of opinion in the ?Senate as to what should be done. I do not think that one-third of the mem bera of the Senate would support President Mc? Kinley? financial plan If It came to a vote. His plan regarding the greenbacks is ?Imply a scheme to make all the note? gold certificate?, and I do not think hi? ideas w11 be supported " Senator Pettigrew aald that he did not know Just how the Senat? stood uoon the Hawaiian question, but hardly thought a large enough vote could be mustered to Insure annexation.

Hubbard, a director In the Bell Telephone Company, and well known to public men. ?dentists snd financier?*, died St Twin Oak*, his suburban home, a fan mU? from th? city, at an early hour this morning Hi death waa due t) a complication of diseases and to agc. being in lils feveny-slxth year. He had been In poor health for ?onie lime, but It waa not until yes'erday that his condition became alarming.
