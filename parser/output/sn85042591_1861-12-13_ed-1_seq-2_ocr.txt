Knit mitton8 are far preferable if they can bo furnished in time; but if not the sewiug machine might be called into requisition. The Boston Journal says: An officer in the army requests os to aak the ladies to make mittens for the Soldiers with one finger as well as a thumb. Without this they can not handle the locks ot the mus kets. 1'ieces of soft leather sewed upon tbe ball of tbe finger and thumb will add to their durability. New Advertisements.
