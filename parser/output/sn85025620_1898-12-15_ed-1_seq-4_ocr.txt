Every face is plainly recognizrble. Lind's election is no surprise at all. Old soldiers voted for him because he was a soldier.

The follow­ ing from his editorial columns: "The editor of the Gazette isnot a candidate for the position of postmaster at St. James. A review of the political situation has dis­ closed the fact that had he been successfull in securing a petition signed by every man, woman and child in the village, aside from four men who have a string at­ tached to the appointing power,he could not secure the appointment. The fact is the writer never really was a candidate. He simp­ ly went into the game to gain an insight into the methods employed by Mr. McCleary in "making post masters." Several good men in various parts of the Second dis­ trict who have worked for years for the republican party and,much to their chagrin, for McCleary, have been "tnrned town" and post office appointments given to men of doubtful political reputation. Notable instances in this turning down process are the appoint­ ments at Windom, Worthington, Blue Earth City and Pipestone. In every one of these places ap­ pointments were made con­ trary to the wishes of the people and in defiance of petitions. It was merely to get at the. cause of this unacountable slaughter that the writer placed himself in a po­ sition to be crushed by the jugger naut. In the past two weeks he has learned enough of the Mc­ Cleary methods to make a book as big as the bible. When the jug­ gernaut rolls over the candidates for the St. James postoffice the edi­ tor of the Gazette will not be numbered among the victims. He will set on the fence and watch it roll over men who are unwise enough to throw themselves in its pathway." Washington Letter. (From Our 3 is) list the nutritive tonic you need.

Washington, December 9,1898 President McKinley by the wise omissions from his annual message to congress has greviously disap­ pointed the democrats. That is why the whole menagerie is snar­ ling.

He dosn't make up his mind upon any sub­ ject blindfolded,least of all upon such an important one as the fu-, ture of 8,000,000 helpless people. He has delivered them from the evils of Spanish rule,and will give them a military government that will be far betterthan any govern­ ment they have ever known. That is far enough to go for some time to come. He will know more about the subject before recommending the next step. There are other omissions equally wise, aad they are equally as nagging to the dem ocrats,who have no other hope for future success than the mistakes they expect the republicans to make.

Senator Vest has offered a reso­ lution declaring that this govern­ ment has no constitutional right to acquire or govern colo nies, and given notice of his intention to make a spech on the resolution The resolution is clearly intended as a "feeler" of the public as well as the senate to ascertain how partisan democrat fight on expan­ sion would be received. Some dem ocratic Senators will follow Vest, but Senator Morgan, who is. not one of them,said ofthe Yest resolu tiin: "The resolution is a little late. The constitutionality of ac­ quiring territory was settled when we took Alaska.The annexation of Hawaii is another fact accomplish­ ed^ that no fact for considera­ tion remains. For one,I do not propose to see the republicons get all the glory of the results of the war. It was not a partizan war to begin with,and the American flag having been planted in the Philip pines,I want to be a participator in the glory which attaches its presence there." That congress will provide for a revival of the grades of Admiral and Vice Admirrl in the Navy seems reasonably certain. It has been reccommended by the Presi­ dent and the Secretary of Navy Senator Hale has offered a resolu­ tion adopted by the Yerment legis lature,asking that the grade of Ad miracle be revived, and that Rear Admiral Dewey be promoted there to. There is no such opposition in congress to the revival of these na val grades as there is to the recom mendation of Gen. Miles that in the reorganization of the army one General and two Lieutenant Gen­ erals should be provi ied for.Simi lar reccommedations have been made in the past by Gens. Sher­ man and Schofield, but oppsition in congress has always preAented action. Speaker Heed had a very pleasant Conference this week with Presi­ dent McKinley and arranged for Another to take place as so in as the Speaker has conferred with his republican colleagues on the House oommitte6 on rules and 1he Republican leaders in the House, and they have agreed upon the legislative programme to be follow ed at this session. As soon-as that program has been determined up­ on the Speaker will submit to the ^President for approval and amend ment The same harmony tbat existed at the last session between Executive and legislative branches 'jf the government is |o be contin- ued,so far as it is in the power of the republicans in the House to continue it. The Senate,on account of its present make-up-no party with a majurty-is necessarily an uncertain quantity in the legisla­ tive program. The only material difference be­ tween the government of Hawaii and New Mexico, Arizona, or Ok­ lahoma, after the bill carrying out the recommendations of the Hawa­ iian commission has become a law, as it is cure to in due time, will be that in the former territory there will be property and an edu­ cational qualification for suffrage. The bills which have been intro­ duced to both House and Senate for the reoaganization of the army do not follow the recommendation of Gen. Miles,because it is not be­ lieved that a bill carrying as many of the high officers as he rec commends could get through con­ gress. The bills introduced pro­ vide for a Lieut.Gen.,six Maj.Gens and twelve Brig. Gens.
