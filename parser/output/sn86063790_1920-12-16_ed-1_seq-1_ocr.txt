Jester, of Greenwood, second vicepresident. W. C. Allen, cf Dillon, was re-elected treasurer and Dr. C. E. r Burts was reelected treasurer. The entire session today and tonight was fraught with interest. Tne convention formally took over Limestone College as a convention school during the morning session. The board of ministerial education was abolished and this work will be taken up by the commission of mis' siona. ^ The convention also decided to insure the lives of all ministers and by " the policy adopted when a preacher 1 dies his beneficiaries will receive a ! sum equal to the salary of the minis- 1 ter in question for one year up to $2, 500. It was decided to establish an acad- 1 ?*mv fihpstprfipld. another at Scran ton, and another in Horry county, and another in Colleton. The definite lo* ' cations of those not already mention- 1 ed will be left to the committee on 1 education. The academy at Ridge dale will be taken over by the con- 1 vention. i During the afternoon session a 1 resolution ~ was introduced by Z. T.

MOKE CONGRESSMAN. Tinkliam Bill Also Introduced to Cut Down Southern Representation. Washington, Dec. 9.?As predicted the fight in congress over the question of whether the representation in the house from Georgia and South Carolina shall be increased one member each, giving Georgia 13 members and South Carolina 8, or whether the present number shall be reduced because of the negro question, has already come to the front. The situation may as well be clearly and thorouighly understood from beginning. The bill of Representative Siegel, of New York, would increase the membership of the house from 435 to 483, Mr. Siegel being chairman of the house committee on census. Mr. Larsen, of Georgia, is also a member of this committee from the Democratic side. ' This increase, Mr. Siegel said, is proposed as a basis of discussion and does not at this time represent anything definite that has been agreed upon. . If this bill is passed it will be necessary for the states of Georgia and South Carolina to have their legislatures redistrict the states, that is ' make over the state lines and reararrange the present disticts as they are laid out at this time. However, Congressman Tinkham, of Massachusetts, will reduce the j present number of members from the south if a resolution which he has ^ just offered is passed. He claims that . because of the suffrage laws working against the negro in the south, the . colored men are not being given^ a . square deal and that he will insist . ;hat not only shall no additional mem- , bers be added to the house roll from that section but that some of those already in the house shall be eliminated. c Had the Republican majority in J the house foeen small it is possible that something of this kind would have been perfected but it is not be- . lieved that with such a large majority they will waste much time on seating a half dozen or more negroes from the south. j Other southern states affected un- j ler the Siegel bill would be as follows: Alabama from 10 to 11; Ar- r kansas from 7 to 8; North Carolina, ^ 10 to 12; Oklahoma, 8 to 9; Tennessee, 10 to 11; Texas 18 to 21; Vir- j ?inia, 10 to 11. From a southern viewpoint this s tvill undoubtedly be the most inter- ^ *sting legislation to come before con- j *ress at this session. 3 Losing Age Rapidly. .

WILL ANNOUNCE DECISION LATER COMMISSION ENDS HEARING ON TELEPHONE RATES. Hot Fight Develops. Chamber of Commerce Opposes Effort of Company to Increase ( liarges in This State. Columbia, Dec. 10.?The South Carolina Railroad commission concluded its two day hearing of the petition of the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph company for a statewide increase in telephone rates yesterday afternoon, reserving its decision to permit further investigation of the question by the commission. The company in its prayer is asking on increase of slightly over 25 per cent, for the telephone charges in South Carolina. This average increase is not, however, to be applied generally, the town and cities under the new schedule being divided into eight groups with the same, rates applied to all exchanges in the group. In this way the charges in at least one town, Cowpens, which now has a rate out :>f proportion with exchanges of similar size m the state, will be reduced. The present charge in Cowpens for cne party lines is $3.50, while under :he group plan the rate for these lines will 'be only $2.25. Allendale, Barnwell, Blackville, | Denmark, Honea Path, Johnston, Leesville, Liberty, Pelzer, Pickens/ Piedmont, Prosperity, St. George and Whitmire are grouped together, with :he following proposed rates: One party business lines, $3.60; two par:y business lines,. 3; four party 5ion telephones, $1.50; one party -esidence lines, $1.80; four party -PQidpnpp linps $1 50 rpsidpnc.p * ' extension sets, $1.25. The exchanges n this group number subscribers "anging from 67 to 114 for a single jxchange. The proposed rates for Bamberg, 3atesburg, Belton, Cheraw, Clio, Dilon, Easley, Edgefield, Greer, Hartsrille, Latta, Marion, Mullins, MoColl, rimmonsville and Summerville are: Dne party business lines, $3.90; one )arty inward lines, $2.50; two party )usiness lines, $3.30; four party busiless lines, $2.7.0; business extension >ets, $1.50; one party residence lines. ?2.40; two party residence lines, ?2.10; four party residence lines, >1.80, and extension sets for resilence lines, $1.25. Subscribers in ;he exchange of this group range torn 107 to 369. Only two witnesses have been leard during the hearing, which be?an Wednesday morning, J. M. B. 3oxsey, of Atlanta, first vice presilent of the Southern Bell company n charge of finances, and George J. iToundt, vice president in charge of operations. Testimony offered has linged largely upon the financial condition of the Southern Bell system, particular reference being paid o the revenues derived from and he expenses incurred by the exchange in South Carolina. The com>any claims that notwithstanding increase in rates the revenues are not iufficient to pay the necessary cost >f maintenance and operation of he lines in this territory. The cor)orate affiliation of the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph com>any and the American Telephone tnd Telegraph company, the parent company, and the contractural relaions of the Southern Bell with the /Vestern Electric company, a subsiliary of the parent company, were ,lso discussed. Twenty of the 52 >xchan.ge points in the state were epresented at the hearinlg. Mass of Statistics. Both witnesses for the company ntroduced a mass of statistical .nalyses and efficiency charts in sup>ort of their contention that the ompany needed more money to pro'ide extensions and improvements, lemanded in this territory. The louthern Bell, according to the testinony, was controlled by the parent nmnonr TrVnVh nU'TlS tVlP SfOPk of he Southern company. The parent ompany, according to the evidence, hrough contracts with the Southern Bell company, collects 4^% of the :ross revenue of the subsidiary com>any for "assistance, advice and fitancial aid." This, the officers of the Southern Bell system claimed, was of ;reat assistance to their company -nd w*as also an economic business ueasure. Attorneys for the chambrs of commerce, opposing the inrease, contended that the practice $25,000,000 BE 

NECESSARY. For Relief of Armenia, Accorcling to State Department. ,Washington, , Dec. 7.?President Wilson's suggestion in his message to congress today that a loan be extended by the United States to the Armenian government brought to j light that the state department has I had the question under consideration : and that it has arrived at the conclusion that a credit of $25,000,000 would be necessary. The Armenian question and the acceptance by President Wilson of the task of mediating between the j Armenians and the Turkish Nationalists was understood to have been discussed today at the regular week ly cabinet meeting,- at which the state department was represented by ! acting Secretary Davis. ! Officials of the state department I supporting the suggestion of a loan ! declared today that the rehabilitation of Armenia could not be expected merely as a result of kind words and an extension of moral support. Reports to the department of conditions in the country have indicated clearly, it was said, that without money the population could not go far in achieving a stable adjustment. ^ in m* Habitual Salutation. "How do the people of Kay See address each other?" asked an acquaintance who seldom left the old home town.

The relation of the Southern Bell company with the Western Electric company, which acts as its purchasing agent, was also attacked as only another measure used by the parent company to control and coerce its subsidiary. John J. McSwain, of Greenville, attorney for 'the chambers of commerce, did not put up any witnesses when the company closed its case with the cross-examination of Mr. Hoxsey yesterday morning, contending that the company had failed to make out its case. Its witnesses, he pointed out, had admitted that there had been a decline in the price of the materials which go into the construction and maintenance of telephone systems. This Mr. McSwain said would necesQQrilxr roHiiPP thp nnprfltir?Pr pyDPTISPS. Other representatives of the chambers of commerce laid particular stress on the strained financial condition of the state, contending that the proper course for the telephone company to pursue was like all other businesses, to take their losses, retrench and await a more favorable time for their proposed expansion. Request for Audit. Mr. McSwain requested the commission to have an audit made of the books of the company, and also an efficiency survey made of the entire corporation to settle the question of waste, offered to pay for the audit and survey, provided the commission would put into effect the proposed schedule of rates, the company to make a refund of the overplus to the subscribers if the charges after investigation were found exhorbitant. This offer was refused by Chairman Frank W. Shealy of the commission, who explained that while there was | no appropriation provided for this purpose, he would consult with the governor to devise some way to have the survey and audit made. Attorney General Wolfe also offered* his assistance. The commission, Mr. Shealy said, did not propose to authorize any increase for the purpose of increasing wages of employees. The company in an exhibit filed with the commission contended further wage increase must be made by the company during 1921, the increase for South Carolina being at an annual rate of $82,000. The increase in rates was asked, Mr. Hoxsey explained, for the primary i purpose of raising its earnings to a point above expenses, where it could borrow money for proposed expansion and maintenance. |: i 

CORN AND PORK IN ABUNDNACE GOVERNOR COOPER ISSUES REASSURING STATEMENT. Can Eat Cornbread. Hogs Plentiful and Hay, Potatoes and Home Canned Goods on Hand. South Carolina today has more corn, hogs, hay, syrup and other articles of food than the state has had in many years, and although the conditions are* depressing, there is no reason for alarm and the facts that must be faced indicate that the state is fundamentally sound economically, according to a statement issued by Governor Cooper. The corn crop of 42,500,000 bush els is enough to furnish one-half of a bushel a week to each of the 325,000 families in the state for 12 months and besides furnishing 60 bushels each for the 200,000 mules and horses in the state, the statement says. "We have in the state at present 1,100,000 hogs, a greater number than we have had since 1860. It is estimated that we can butcher$700,000 of these and if each of the hogs averaged 125 pounds, which give us 87,500,000 pounds of pork or 270 pounds per family, an amount which will furnish about 75 per cent, of our meat supply," the statement says. Below is the statement: Plenty of Corn. "The director of the extension service of Clemson college and the United States department of agriculture have called my attention to agricultural conditions that should be known and impressed at this time as they have a decided bearing upon the economic conditions of the present and the near future in South Carolina. I understand from Director Long that we have produced this year in South Carolina the largest corn crop in the history of the state. This crop of 42,500,000 bushels is sufficient to furnish one-half bushel per week for 12 months to each or the 325,000 families in the state, totalling 10,000,000 'bushels, and at the same time furnishing 60 bushels each, a liberal year's supply, to our 290,000 mules and horses, aggregating 17,000,000 bushels. This makes a total of 27,000,000 bushels for human and animal consumption, 'leaving 15,500,000 bushels for seed and for fattening our stock. "We have in the state at present 1,100,000 hogs, a greater number than we have had since 1860, from which it is estimated that we- can butcher 700,000. If each of these 700,000 averages 125 pounds, which is a reasonable estimate, this will give us 87,500,000 pounds of pork, or 270 pounds per family, an amount which will furnish about 75 per cent, of our necessary meat supply. "We have also one of the largest hay crops saved in a number ol 1 years, and we have one'of the largest acreages of recent years in sorfghum and cane, furnishing us considerably over an average yield of syrup.' We nave, 100, an increased aciecise m sweet potatoes with an indication of an increased yield. Our homes are stocked with a generous supply of i home-made canned goods. Labor to be Better. "The above facts are obtainable from the bureau of statistics of the i United States department of agriculture, our most reliable . source of such information. These figures in themselves are encouraging in any consideration of our general econoic condition. "If in addition to the above facts labor situation is sure to make decided improvement and that the cost ; of fertilizers and other material and expenses of producing the 1921 crop will be lower, we can more fully realize that the future is not as dark as it might otherwise seem at pres- ' ent. Labor is almost sure to be more plentiful, less exacting, and consequently more efficient than it has , been during the past year or two. ] Fertilizers will undoubtedly decline, * 1 1 ^ ^ A* -m O f AT'lO 1 1 as Will 111*3

Tells Why He Favors Revival of War Finance Board. Washington, Dec. 8.?Congressman Byrnes, of South Carolina, who is leading the fight in the house for resumption of operations of the war finance corporation in the interest of cotton, today issued the following statement, showing clearly what is intended to be accomplished and what w/41 be the result if the present movement is successful. "I have in-' troduced a concurrent resolution merely requesting the secretary of the treasury to immediately cause the War Finance Corporation to function. No legislation is necessary because under the act of March 3rd, the congress provided that the corporation could continue in business until one year after the ratification of the peace treaty. "The reason it .is not functioning today is because the secretary of the treasury, who, under the law, must approve all loans, issued an order on May 1st, 1920, suspending all operations of the corporation. The secretary states he issued the order because at that time our exports had increased and he deemed it unnecessary and further believed that the government should not stay in the banking business. The act, however, is not a war act, as it was not passed until four months after the armistice the congress discussed the question of the government staying in the banking business and decided that this particular activity was necessary * during the period of reconstruction: and should continue for a year after ratification tfie peace treaty, again our exports, which on May 1st showed an increase, have not decreased. "I am satisfied that the secretary of the treasury notwithstanding his stronlg views against the operation of the corporation, will obey a request . from congress, and it is the most practical assistance now available. All the machinery exists and it can aid in promptly increasing the exports. When in New York investigating this matter I learned that Liverpool interests had oversold the future market to a geater extent than ever before. In a short while Liverpool will begin buying spot cotton at the depressed price. An increase in price should result but the man who most needs help will not' look with much hope for any greater extension of credit from the Federal Reserve Board and the finance corporation offers in my opinion the best opportunity for assistance." >;
