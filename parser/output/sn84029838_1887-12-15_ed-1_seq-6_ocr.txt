'Hfio THE MESSAGE. A BriofEut Pointed Moe3aso Sent to Congress. Tariff Ksdnntion the Main Question Xrcaleil JJy tins President A Docu ment Tiiat the lipl Will Bead With Interest. "WAcnixoTOX, Dec. G. The President's message was ready for both houses of Congress as soon as business commenced this morning. The document is unique in that it deals with oniy one subject the necessity or a reduction of taxation. The President felt that th:s necessity was so urgent that he departed from the ordinary custom and devoted his whole message to impress upon Congress the danger ol de luy. The address plunges into the ques tion at tho si art as follows: To the Congr.'ts of the Unifcd Stctf: You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a condition of the na tional finance which imperatively demands im mediate and careful consideration. The amount of money annually exacted, through the opera tion of picsent laws, from the industries and necessities of the people, largely exceeds the sum necessary 1 meet the expenses of the Government. When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his Industry and enterprise, with only such de duction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Govern ment which protects hint, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible ex tortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the burden of National taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The public treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding-place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crippling our National energies, suspending oar country's development, preventing Investment in pro ductive enterprises, threatening financial dis turbance, and inviting schemes of public plun der. Tli is condition ofourtreasury is not altogether new; and it has more than once of late been submitted to tho people's representatives in the Congress, who alono can apply a remedy. And yet the situation still continues, with ag gravated incidents, more than ever presaging linancial convulsion and widespread disaster. It will not do to neglect this situation because its dangers arc not now palpably imminent and apparent. They exist none the less certainly, and await the unforeseen and unexpected occa sion when suddenly they will be precipitated upon us. Oa tho 80th day of June, 185, the excess of revenues over public expenditures, after com plying with the an.ual requirements of tho Sinking Fund act, was l,S.W,?35.8t; during the year ended June 30, lSSO, such excess amounted to $19 4U3,ri5A'0; and during the year ended June 30. 18S7, it reached the sura of $Tm,567,&49.50. The annual contributions to the sinking fund during tho three years above specified, amounting in the aggregate to ii:W,().8,3.'0.01, and deducted from the surplus as stuted, were made by call ing in for that purposi: outstanding three per ceut. bonds of the Government. 1-jr.ng the six months prior to June .TO, 1837, the surplus revenue had grown so large by re veated accumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of the country, that tho sum of 79,Sil,lGO of buch surplus was anpliod to the payment of the principal and interest of the three per cent bonds still outstanding, an'l which wliere then payable at the option of the Government. The precarious condition of financial affairs among the people still needing relief, immediately after the :i)th day of Juue. 1Ss7. the remainder of tho three per cent, bonds then outstanding, amount ing with principjl and interest to the sum of ?1 8,377,.' !!:i, were called in and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding theso operations of the Treasury Department the representations of distress in business circle) not only continued but increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these circumstances the contribution to the sinking fund for the current fiscal year was at once comploted by the ex penditure of vJ7,05t,.tJ..-M in tho purchase of Government bunds not due bearing 454 per cent, interest, the premium p:id thereon averaging about twenty-four per cent, for the former and eight per cent, for the latter. In ad dition to this tho interest accruing during the current year upon the outstanding bonded in debtedness of the Govcruincnt wus to some extent anticipated, and banks selected as depositories of public money were permitted to somewhat increase their deposits. While the expedients thus employed to re lo ise to the people the money lying idle in the treasury served to avert immediate danger, our surplus revenues have continued to accu mulate, the excess for the present year amount ing on the flr.t day ot December to ?.".Vi8, 701.19, and is estimated to reach the sum or 

8'113,(XX),OJO on the 0-)lh of Juue next, at which date it is expected that this sum. added to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus in the treasury to $140,000,000. There seems to bo no assurance, that, with such a withdrawal from use of the people's cir culating medium, our business community may not in the near future be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately produced from the same cause. And while the functions of our National treasurv should be few aud simple, and vhile its best condition would bo reachod, I be lieve, by its entire disconnection with private business interests, yet, when, by a perversion of its purposes, it idly holds money uselessly sub tracted from the channels of trade, there seems to bo reason for tho claim that some legitimate means should be devised by the Government to restore in an emergency, without waste or ex travagance, such money to its place among the people. If such an emergency arises, there now exists no clear aud undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption of three per cent, bonds, which were payable at the option or the Government, has afforded a means for the dis burscment or tho excess or our revenues: but these bonds have all been retired, and there are no bonds outstanding the payment or which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution to the sinking fund, which furnishes the occa sion for expenditure in the purchase of bonus, has been already made Tor the current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. In the present state or legislation, tho only pretense of any existing executive power to re store, at this time, any part or our surplus rev enues to the people by its expenditure, consists in the supposition that the Secretary ot the Treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of the Government not yet due at a rate of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of law from which such a power could be derived is found in the appropriation bill passed a number of years ago, and it is subject to the suspicion that it was intended as tem porary and limited in its application, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and authority. No condition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single offloial, upon his judgment of its necessity, to withhold from or release to the business of the people, in an unusual manner, money held in the treas ury, and thus affect, at his will, the linancial situation of the country: and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary of the Treasury the authority in the present juncture to pur chase bonds, it should be plainly vested and provided as far as possible with such checks and limitations as will define thts official's right and discretion, and at the samo time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means or restoring to circulation the surplus money accumulating in the treasury it should be borne in mind that premiums must be paid on a large part of these bonds held as in vestments which can not be purchased at any price, and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell may unreasonably en hance tho cost of such bonds to the Govern ment. It has been suggested that the present bond ed debt might be refunded at a loss rate of in terest, and the difference between the old and new security paid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the treasury. The success of this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon the volition ot the holders or the present bonds; and it is cot entirely certain that the induce ment which must be offered them would result in more financial benefit to tho Government than the purchaso of bonds, while the latter proposition would reduce the principal of the debt by actual payment, instead of extending it. The proposition totleposit the money held by the Government in banks throughout the coun try for use by the people is, it seems to me, ex ceedingly objectionable in principle, as tat lishlng too close a relationship between the operations of the Government treasury and the business cf the country, and too extensive a commingling of their money thus fostering an unnatural reliance in private business upon public funds. If this scheme should be adopted it should only be rtone as a temporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and executive effort should generally be in the op posite direction and should have a tendency to divorce, as much and as fast as can safely be done, the Treasury Department from private enterprise. Of course it is not expected that unnecessary and extra vagant appropriations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation or an excess or revenue. Such expenditure, besides the demoralization or all just conceptions or public duty which it entails, stimulates a habit ot reckless improvidence not in the least con sistent with the missionr our people or the high and beneficent ideas of our Government. I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge or my countrymen as well as to the attention ot their representatives charged with the responsibility or legislative relicr the grav ity of our financial situation. The failure or Congress "heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature or the difficulty must necessarily pro duce, caused a condition of financial distress and apprehension since your last adjournment which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within executive control; and these appear now to be exhausted. ir disaster results rrom the continued inac tion or Congress, the responsibility must rest whore it belongs. Though the situation thus rar considered is fraught with danger which should be fully real ized, and though it presents a feature of wrong to tho people as well as peril to the country, it is but a result growing out of a perfect and ap parent cause, constantly reproducing the sae alarming circumstances a congested National treasury and depicted monetary condition in the business of the country. It need hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like pre dicament in the future by the removal of its cause. Our scheme of taxation, by means or which this needless surplus is taken from the people and put into the public treasury, consists of a tiriff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors. It must be conceded that none of the things subjected to internal revenue tax ation arc, strictly speaking, necessaries. There appears to be no just complaint of this taxation by tho consumers or these articles, and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion or the people. But our present tariff laws, the vicious, in equitable and illogical source of unnecessary taxation, ought to b3 at once revised and amended. These laws as thoir primary 'and plain effort raiso the price to consumers of all articles imported aud subject to duty by pre cisely the snm paid for such duties. Thus the amount or the duties measures tho tax paid by those who purchase for use theso imported articles. Many of these things, however, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and the du ties now levied upon foreign goods and products are called protection to theso home manufac tures, because they render it possible for those or our people who are manufacturers to make these taxed nrticlcs and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the imported goods that have paid customs duty. So it happens that while comparatively a few use the import ed articles, millions of our people, who never use and never saw any of the foreign products, purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country and pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the imported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into the public treasury, but the great majority of our citizens, who buy domestic ar ticles of the same class, pay a cum at least ap proximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. This reference to the operation of our tariff lasvs is not made by way of instruc tion, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestic prod ucts as well as those who consume imported articles, and thus create a tax upon all our people. It is not proposed to entirely relieve the coun try or this taxation. It must be extensively continued as the source or the Government's income, and in a readjustment ot our tariil the interests or American labor engaged in manu facture should bo carefully considered, as well as the preservation of our manufacturers. It may be called protection, or by any other name, but relief from the hardships and dangers of our present tariff law should be devised with especial precaution against imperiling the ex istence of our manufacturing interests. But this existence should not mean a condition which, without regard to the public welfare or a National exigency, must always insure the realization of immense profits instead of mode rately profitable returns. As the volume aud diversity of our National activities increase, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuance of the advan tages which thoy conceive the.prcscntsystem of tariff taxation directly effects. So stubbornly have all efforts to reduce tho present condition been resisted by those of our fellow-citizens thus engaged, that they can hardly complain of the suspicion, entertained to a certain extent, that there existed an organized combination all along the line to maintain their advantage. We are in the middle of centennial celebra tions, and with Incoming pride we rejoice in American skill and ingenuity, in American en ergy and enterprise, and in the wonderful natural advantages and resources developed by a century's National growth. Yet when an at tempt is made to justify a scheme which per mits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers quite beyond a reasonable demand for Government regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to call our manufactures infant industries, still need ing tho highest degree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from Federal legisla tion. It is also said that tho increase in the price of domestic manufactures resulting from the present tariff is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our worKingmcn em ployed in manufactures than are paid for what is called tho pauper labor of Europe. All will acknowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our workingmen. Labor is honorable in the eyes of every American citizen; and as it lies at the foundation ot our development and progress, it is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy. to the ut most regard. The standard of our laborers' life should not be measured by that of any other country less favored, and they are entitled to their full share of our advantages. By the last census it is made to appear that of the lT.SO.'.Uffl of our population is engaged in all kinds of industries, 7,670.493 are employed in agriculture, 4,074,23$ in professional and personal service, (2,9'f4,87o or whom are do mestic servants and laborers.) while 1,810,26 are 'employed in trade and transportation, and 3,837,11" arc classed as employed in manufac turing and mining. For present purposes, however, the last num ber giveu should be considerably reduced. Without attempting to enumerate all. it will be conceded that there should be deducted rrom those which it includes, 373. 143 carpenters and joiners, 235,401 milliners, dressmakers and seamstresses, lTii.T&j blacksmiths, 131,750 tail ors and tailoresses, 103.473 masons, 70.341 butch ers. 41,309 bakers. 23,033 plasterers, 4,831 en gaged in manufacturing agricultural imple ments, amountkg in the aggregate to 1,314. 033, leaving 2.023,089 persons employed in such manufacturing industries as are claimed to be benefited by a high tariff. To these the ap peal is made to save their employment and maintain their wages by resisting a change. There should be no disposition to answer such suggestions by tho allegation that they are in a minority among those who labor, and there fore shorn forego an advantage in the in terest or low prices for the majority. Their compensation, as it may be affected by the operation of tariff laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept in view; and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook iw fact that they arc consumers with tho rest; that they, too, have their owa wants and those of their families to supply from their earnings, and that the prices of the necessaries of life, as well as the amount of their wages, will regulate tho measure of their welfare and comfort. But the reduction of taxation demanded should be measured as not to necessitate or justiry either the loss or employment by the workingman or the lessening or his wages; and the profits still remaining to the manufacturer, after a necessary readjustment, should fur nish no excuse for the sacrifice or the inter ests of his employes either in their opportunity to work or in the diminution of their compensa tion. Nor can the worker in manufactures fail to understand that while a high tariff is claimed I to be necessary to allow the payment of remun erative wages, it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sorts of manu factures, which, in almost countless forms, be needs for the u-e or himself and his family. He receive at the desk of his employer his wages, and perhaps before he reaches his home is obliged, in a purchase for family use ot an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of the increase In price which the tariff permits, the hard-earned compensa tion ot many days of toil. The farmer or the agriculturist who manu factures nothing, but who pays the increased price which' the tariff imposes upon every agri cultural implement, upon all he wears and upon all ha uses and owns, except the increase or his flocks and herds and such things as in his hus bandry he produces from the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining tho present situation; and he is told that a high duty on Imported wool is nec essary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear, in order that the price or their wool may be increasod. They, or course, are not re minded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, in his purchases or cloth ing aid woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fallow farmer as well as to the manufactur er and merchant; nor is any mention made or the fact that the sheep owners themselves and their households must wear clothing and use other articles manufactured from "he wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must return their share ot this increased price to the tradesman. I think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion or the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small Mocks numbering rrom twenty-five to fiy. Tho duty on the grade of imported wool which those sheep yield is ten cents for each pound if or the value or thirty cents, and twelve cents ir or the value or more than thirty cents, ir the liberal estimate or six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be sixty or seventy-two cents, and this may be taken as the utmost enhancement of the price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dol lars would thus represent the increased price of the wool from twenty-five sheep and thirty-six dollars that from the wool of fifty sheep; aud at present values this addition would amount to, about one-third of its prii-e. If upon its sale the farmer receives this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precise ly that sum, which in all its changes will ad here to it, until it reaches the consumer. When manufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use its co3t is not only increased to tho extent of the farmers' tariff profit but a further sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws In tho meantime the day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe himseir and family for the winter. When he faces the tradesman for that purpose he discovers that he is obliged not only to return in the way or increased prices his tariff profit oa the wool he sold, and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is aroused to tho fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of the tariff scheme, which, when he sold his wool, seemed so profitable an increase in price, more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged in wool-raising is compared with all the farmers in the country, and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered: when it is made apparent that, in case or n large part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the present taritf on wool is illusory: and, above all, when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate means and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the young and old, and that it constitutes a tax, which, with relentless grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man, woman and child in the land, reasons arc suggested why the removal or reduction of this duty should be included in a revision or our tariff laws. In speaking of the increased cost to the con sumer of our home manufacture, resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact is not overlooked that com petition among our domestic producers some times has the effect of keeping the price ol their products below the highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this compe tition is too often strjngled by combinations quite prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which have for their object the regulation or the supply and price or commodi ties made and sold by members or the combina tion. The people can hardly hope for any con sideration in the operation ot these selfish schemes, ir, however, in the absence of such combination, a healthy and free competition roduces tho price of any particular dutiable article or home production below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our tariff laws, and if, with such reduced price, its manu facture continues to thrive, it is entirely evi dent that one thing has been discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation. The necessity of combina tion to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept 1 wer prices for such com modity, and that such prices are remunerative and lower prices produced by competition prove tho same thing. Thus where either of these conditions exists, a caso would seem to bo pre sented for an easy reduction of taxation. The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues ot the Government be pre vented by the reduction of our customs duties, and, at the same time, to emphasizu a sugges tion that in accomplishing this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our people by grant ing to them a measure of relief from tariff taxa tion where it is most needed and from sources which it can bo most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can the presentation made or such consid erations be, with any degree or fairness, re garded as evidence of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing interests, or of any lack of ap preciation of the value. These interests constitute a leading and most substantial element of our Nutional greatness and furnish the proud proof or our country's proarcss. Butir. in the emergency that presses on us, our manufacturers are asked to surrender something for the public good and to avert dis aster, their patriotism, as well us a grateful re cognition of advantages already afforded, should lead them to willingly co-operate. No demand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of governmental regard, but they can not fail to be ad monished of their duty, as well as their enlightened selMntcrcst and safoty, when they arc reminded or tho fact that financial panic and collapse, to which tho present condi tion tends, afford no greater shelter or pro tection to our manufactures than to our other important enterprises. Opportunity for safe, careful and deliberate reform is now offered, and none of us should be unmindful of the time when abused and irritated people, heedless or those who have been resisted timely and reasonable relicr, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification ot their wrongs. Tho difficulty attending a wise and fair revis ion of our tariff laws is not underestimated. It will require on the part of tho Congress great labor and care, and especially a broad and na tional contemplation or the subject, and a patri otic disregard of such local and selfish ciaims as aie unreasonable and reckless of the welfare or the entire country. Under our present laws more than four thous and articles arc subject to duty. Many or these do not in any way compete with our own manu factures, and many are hardly worth attention as subjects or revenue. A considerable reduc tion can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries presents no features of hardship, but the neces saries of life, used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheap ened. The radical reduction of the duties imposed upon raw material used in manufactures, or its free importation, is of course an important fac tor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries. It would not only relieve them trom the iucrcased cost caused by the tariff on such material, but the manufactured product being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such product, as a compensation to our manufacturers for the present price of raw material, could be accordingly modified. Such reduction, or free importation, would servo beside to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a change can have any injurious effect up on our manufacturers. On the contrary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen their wares by free material. Thus our people might have the opportunity of extending their sales beyond the limits -.f home consumption saving them from the depression, interruption in business, and loss caused by a glutted domestic market, and affording their employes more certain and steady labor, with its resulting quiet and contentment. The question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached in a spirit higher than partisanship and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those intrusted with the weal of a .confiding people. But the obliga tion to declared party policy and principle is not wanted to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political patties now repre sented In the Government have, by repeated ana authoritative declarations, condemned the condition of our laws which permit the collec tion from the oeoole of unnecessary revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised IU correction; and neither as citizens or partisans are our countrymen in a mood to condone the deliberate violations or these pledges. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection and rree trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It is a condition which conrronis us not a theory- Relief fom this conpition may involve a slight reduction of the advantages which we aw.ird our home pro ductions, but the entire withdrawal of such ad vantages should not be contemplated. The question or free trade is absolutely irrelevant; and the persistent claim made in certain quar ters, that all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free traders, is mischievous and far removed from any consideration for the publio good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary ex penses of an economical operation or the Gov ernment, and to restore to the business or the country the money which we hold in the treas ury through the perversion or governmental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our industries without danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor which our workingmen need and with benefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of subsistence and increasing the meas ure of their comforts. The Constitution provides that the President shall from time to time give to the Congress in formation or the state or the Union." It has been the custom or the executive in compliance with this provision, to annually exhibit to the Congress, at the opening or its session, the general condition or the country, and to de tail, with some particularity, the operations or the different executive department. It would be especially agreeable to follow this course at the present time, and to call attention to the valuable accom plishments of these departments during the last fiscal year, but I am so much impressed with the paramount importance of the subject to which this communication has thus far been devoted that I shall forego the addition of any other topic, and only urge upon your im mediate consideration the "State or the Union" as shown in the present condition or our treas ury and our general fiscal situation, upon which every clement of our safety and prosperity de pends. The reports of tho heads of departments, which will be submitted, contain full and ex plicit information touching the transaction of business intrusted to them, and such recom mendations relating to legislation in the publio interest as they deem advisable. I ask for these reports and recommendations the delib erate examination and action or the legislative branch or tho Government. There are other subjects not embraced in tho departmental report demanding -legi-lativo consideration, and which I should be glad to submit. Some ot them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous messages, and as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recom mendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the Department or Slate, a brier history of tho transactions or that important department, together with other matters which it may here after be deemed essential to commend to the attention of the Congruss, may furnish the occa sion for a future communication.

AMIABLE SENATORS. Harmonious Action of Democratic and ltrpultlicun Senators. Washington, Dee. 0. After the adjourn ment of the Senate the lleimblicans hold a short caucus upon tho question of filling committee vacancies, but nothing was done beyond supointing a Caucus Committee of. seven, of which Senator Hoar is chairman, to arrange the matter. Senators Blair, Al lison, Evarts, Riddteberger, Dolph and Sherman are tho other members of tho committee. It will have its first meeting this morning. The Democratic Committee, having the same subject in charge, also held a short meeting, but a quorum was not present. It is not proposed to make any demand for a division of committee chairmanships, ac cording to party strength, the Democrats holding that the chairmanships belong to the majority. The Democrats will take no positive action in arranging minorities on the Senate committees uutil they get the Republican lists. The tendency of events upon both sides points to a harmonious arrangement of all party matters iu connection with the or ganization of the Senate and its commit tees. The seating of Senator Tutpie and the objection to Senator Faulkner were the re sults of an understanding to which both sides assented. NOMINATIONS.
