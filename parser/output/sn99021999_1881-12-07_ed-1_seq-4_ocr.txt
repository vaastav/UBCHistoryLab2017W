Ptestdent Arthur's first message will bo clashed among the ablest nnd most compruhunsivo state pnpurs that have ever omnnalcd fiom the pen of nny national chief executive. It em bodies the views held by the presi dent on nearly every measure and qt'tistioti with hih congress will be ctiled on to grapple during his admin istration. It pri'HCtiU to the American people a compict review of thu opor.ii lions of every department of govern- mutit and contains many timely and wlioleao'iio lecommondations that can not foil to command popitlnrapproval. While wu cannot give nn unqualified uiidorarmunt tt ovary rocoinmondiilion made by the president , his mcjsigo iw n whole cannot bo too hiuhly com mended for its cniulor and breadth Aniont , ' the moU striking features of the president's message nro his recom mendations for the abolition of all internal revenue taxe.s uxcupt those imposed on the fnlo and ninnufaturo of tobacco and lujuora , his undoreo- moiit of Postmaster ( ioneral James' [ iroject for postal uavingi banks and reduced letter pontage , his urgent up- po.il to congruen to enact laws to dc- line presidential inability , provide safeguards for the caiivun'i of tliu ulectotal vote1 , dovisu measures for thu suppression of polygamy in the ter- ritoiies , reconsturct our navy and to- orKani/.u thu United SLutes judiciary.

KANSAS EPIDEMIC Since the time whan the dreaded diacaso of "corebrospinal monihgotis" irst appeared on the scone to frighten patients into convulsions and to afford a safe refuge behind which medical gnoranco could conceal itsulf , nothing quito so extraordinary has occurred aa the "boil on the arm" epidemic which ia now swooping through every county in Kansas and attacking all classes of persons without respect to size , sex or color. The insidious nature oftho disease , its singular origin and the rapidity with which it is di.ssominat- inn itself has put o"ory doctor in the state at lopgcrheads and broken up four hitherto harmonious medical socie ties. The Lcavunworth medical socie ty nt their October mooting appointed a committee of nix to investigate the causes and nature of this extraordina ry epidemic the history of it's course as a disease and the remedies which have proved most elllcacious in arrest ing its progress. Thuir report which WIIH presented at the last mooting of thu organi/.Uion must bo of absorbing interest to every Katisan no lesi to our Nebraska people on the Kanias border. Tour members of tlio committee presented a majority report giving the following singular facts. It appears that the firs aymptoms of "boil dn the nrm' ' put in theirnppoarancu shortly after the passage of the pro hibition amendment to the Kansau constitution nnd its enforcement in the town of Emporia. Dr. Nobles who is practisingphysiqian in that sequestered little villngo reports that tin August lOih n workman named Glodd applied to him for medical treatment , Upon examination ho discovered that ho wns suffering from n Bovore case of "boil on thu nrm" which ho stated had fii-at exhibited itsulf upon the day inliich the loca ] saloons had been closed. Doctor Nobles immediately prescribed "dpiritus frumunti" nnd bottled bcur in , largo medicinal , dosi-j with im mediate effect. Dotwcon August 10th nnd August Sfitli ton pints of , " piritus frumunti" and thitty bottles of beer wore administered nttho und of which time the disuaao disappeared. Tlio most singular circumstance connected with the case is the rapidity with which other localities in Lyon county become innoculntGd with the discaso. It swept through Kniporin like wil'- lire , Inking jw its ' aconi } victim "Iho" worthy doctor anil invading the homes and arms of near- ly every prominent citixun in tin-place. From Kmporia it lotiDod to Morton , Atticitft nnd Hartford nnd within the space of two works eight hundru'i residents of Lyor.a county were suffer ing from the "boil on the arm" epi demic and nllnying < huir pain by medi cinal closes of "spiritus frumunti" and bottled beer. The inijorily report of the Lu.ivonworth Mo.lical Society states tint in thuir investigation into tlio disoiso they thomielvcn bocamu affected and foiled that tfio only reme dy which at all met the roqiiirciirjntM of the occision wns the original one uiod by Djctor Noble i. Thuy ropott that "boil uii thu nrm" is without doubt a unique disease which had it *

Itemody , close drug Htons This report was evidently so bi.iaud by thu peculiar opinioim of the minority that it was voted down by nn over whelming vote nnd t'io majority re port accepted. Kansas can now rjjoicu over hiving discovered n now disuaso , invuitigi- ted the C.UIHJ and found out a rumedy. Horoaftcr "boil on the arm" will take its placu in the list of human ailinoutii caused by prohibitory legislation and and which can only bo at all miccesi- fully mot under tbo operations of thu saving clause "apiritun fruiaonti" for "medicinal " purposes. Jt'nac POIITKII'H riddling cross-ex animation of Guituau exposed in its true light the feigned insanity of the cowardly assassin.
