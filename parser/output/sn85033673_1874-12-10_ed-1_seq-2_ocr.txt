AIOTBIX CAKfi-T BAGeil II 61IAf ' T&OUBLt. Tke Hob. Wa H. H. Stowell. of M8&-cVnuei:t, settled in Vireioia after tke war ojneotibly to practice law, but really to ran for cSce. He tacceeded in getting to Concrei ty tbe negro ote from tke Foarth DittricC IJts been elected twice, if w mistake not, auj if the aon io-law of General AreriH, of Minnessota. The a) Stowett it a pure cpecimen of tke lank, hungry New En gland Yankee, with cheek, impader.ee, ranity and enpidiiy enough to carry a dozen men through the world. It teemt that bit pay aud the back aslary grab only tharpened hit appetite for raore money, and that be vtnt into the cadet peddling buiinesi. It it charged that for the consideration of flOOO, be Lad one Schoolcraft appointed at cadet midshipman to the Uni ted States Naval Academy at Annsipolig, although 9fchoolcra(t wat never a resident of Sloirell't district Mr. John T. Brady, a member pf tbe Virginia Legislaturt, formally presenud charge against Stowell to the Speaker of the House of Representatives to Congress latt Tuesday, lurnishiog at the game time the names of responsible witnesses, including til at of George W. Graham, a State Senator, who was the attorney that made the negotiations Stowell agrees to demand committee of investigation, and an attempt will doubtless be made to whitewash hi but it will he a difficult job, as Stowell it a very contemptible character. Mr. Beck, of Kentucky, succeeded in getting a bill through the House of Re preventatives prohibiting Senatars and Representatives from appearing as coun eel against the United States. That is tbey shall not appear ou both aid.i. Jf it becomes a law it will prevent a great deal of downright stealing. The Courier Journal's special says: "General But ler insisted that it should be referred to the Committee on tbe Judiciary, of which be is chairman. Mr. Beck protested insisting that the Committee of Ways and Means should control it, if referred at all He showed the urgent necessity of the law by producing the record in the case of the New York and Harlem river rsilroad against the Uuited States, in which Senator Couklin appeared as coansel for the railroad before a judge whe ha re cently been appointed on bis own re commendation, and obtained judgment for over 00,000 of internal revenue col lected from the company, lie referred also to the Farragut prize cases, the taxed cosU in which amounted to nearly tlOO.OOO, of which some 80,0rt0 was paid to Gen. Butler as counsel. The ia troduclion of the bill created quite a Butter, but me uncieaa oirm wuo wen fob affected by it thought t best to keep quiet, at they were est strong enough to beat the measure. They will, however, do their level best in tbe Senate, when CoD kling cracks bit whip over tbe dominan t party." , 

ABKAHSAS AFFAIRS. It 8F,ems doubtful whether Congress will interfere in Arkansas affairs. Tbe more thoughtful members know that it would be exceedingly inconsistent to do so after declining to investigate the un lawful government that has existed in Louisiana for two years. In the House of Representatives yesterday that por tion of the President's message relating to Arkansas was referred to the select committee on that subject appointed at the last session. The portion referring to Louisiana affairs was referred to a select committee of seven members to be appointed by the Speaker. The Re publican Senators held a caucus yester day to consider Arkansas affairs. Very few of them favored intervention in the affairs of that State. A desperate effort will be made by this Con cress to do aomethine toward restoring the ltepubli can party to the favor of the people, and no doubt tome ot tut more aiscreet leaders will favor a very mild and con ciliating policy. They will not urge the claims of V. V. Smith and the Clayton party if their restoration in Arkansas would injure the Republican party at large. Thk Courier-Journal eay the Presi dent' tneuage is to weighty with errors that it can only be digested a slice at a time, and further that it is a message with which the people of the United States nsicht well feel ashamed and mor tified. This fully justifies tberowm"nu of the Lvrwita- rw EbkI-w4 RAWifcera Pr anai-InU . Ie tb Editor of th Ldr: Your correspondent, " Another of the Sixty Teachers," hope there it but oae of the sixty who doet aot admire Mr. Pickett't habit of pronanciog.

Befjre the convening of court, Judge Kite wat fcieu to Bnder stand that all the men in the klan desired to give themselves np, that they could be assured of being lightly death th. In Lis charge to tbe grand jury File took occasion to call the attention of tbe jury to tbe fact that those who had simply prowled in mask over tbe conn try at night, and who had been guilty of no sreat offense, would only be sub ject to trial for misdemeanor under the farst section of wbal was known as tne Kuklux act, which imposed aCne of f 100 and imprisonment at the discretion of tbe jury, lbe members ol toe Man soon after began to pour into Carthage aau to submit their cases, lbey were re quired to take an oath that tbey would Beve' after go in mask, nor ia any man ner to connect themselves with any organisation of the nature of Kuklux, and they did so, beside giving bond to keep tke peace for one year. On a petition signed by the Indue and jury. Governor Brown remitted tbe Caes and taraonea lDe misdemeanors. Most of tbe members ol the Klan were between the ages of 1-S or Jtj years. They did not counteuace tbe deeds of blood ocmm'uted by a few men in the killing of Dick Mc.iiley and llall the informer, and they propos.a o do everything in their power to bring those desperadoes to justice. There will be no pardon or leniency slicffn them. Kukluxism in the counties mentioned, and in fact in any other of tha counties where hands existed, is now a thing of the oast, the murder of llall and Dick fttcrviniey startled all who Hud worn a mask, and they were glad enough to accept the pardon granted them and be done with it forever. fJronwd sad .ft?

At first he tried to catch the parky running after it backward. Then he sought to balance himself on one foot, and tried to throw his bat over the post office, while he kopped wildly down the grade. Then he put both his feet upon a level with tbe top of the departing car, broke his cane aud pounded th Crm, hard boulders with his head and eve- glasses, and then he tried to slide down the grade on his shoulder-blades, with only partial success, and finally caught hold of tbe track with his teeth and hands, to keep himself from Hying to pieces.

FOKEIGX. London, December 10. The following dispatch has been received from Prof. Davidson, chief astronomer of the Amer ican expedition to Najasaki: "During our observation of the transit of Venu the weather was unusually cloudy an unpromising. The time at which it was calculated the transit would begin passed away without our being able to record the exact moment of the first contact with any trustworthy result. After about a quarter of an bour and before Venus reached the stage of her aenon contact the observer caught glimpse of the sun and planet and was quite successful in taking several measure' menu of the planets. Further measure ments of tke distance between Venus and the sun' western edge were made with the micrometic. In all there were 150 micrometic measurements of line taken between the casps. Besides these thirty-one micrometic observations were made of the passage of both edge of the sun across the meridian of the ita tion, and similar view of the right and left rims of Venus in crossing the tame line. Eigteen micrometic surveys were made of the respective declination of the sun and planet by observing both upper and lower licbs while passing tbe meridian. About sixty excellent photo graphs of the (ransit during various period of its occurrence were taken. Extreme good fortune attended tho as tronomers, for just as Venus departed from the sun the clouds began to gather and threaten rain. Toward the close of November we were enabled to telegraph the difference of longitude to Vladivos tok, so that the location of the position here is definit'ly determined." The transit of Venus was successfully observed at Uobartstown, Adelaide, Mel bourne and at point in India, China and Japan. The American party only partly succeeded at Uobartstown. Tbe storm of yesterday was very dis astrous to shipping. A dozen vessels are ashore at -Whitby, and one is report ed suuk with all on board. Mails from France were several hours behind titue. eavy damage was done to the works in tbe harbor of Jersey. Two hundred yards of pier were swept away, and blocks ol concrete weighing several tons, ere displaced and broken. The storm was very severe on the continent. The telegraph lines between Italy, Switzer land and Prit are down and communi cation interrupted. Tbe bullion in the Bank of England increased 303,000 pounds the past week. Tbe proportion of the bank reserve to liability, which last week was 37 J per cent., is now U per cent. Kisijstox, Ji.iiCA, December 10.

One of tbe methods adopted by the authorities of Paris or the encourage ment of birds in the parks of that city is the manufacture and placing of artin cial nests so cunningly constructed that each variety ot bird will recognize its home at once, and suppose it to b tha vacated mansion of a bird family just moved out. lbe nests are made by wo men, and L Illustration says: they make them for the thieving and quarrel some sparrow, tbe titmouse, tbe warbl the kingfisher, the chaffinch, cuckoo blackbird, magpie and others.

The larirer the fund to be diatriliuted in ifu the greater will be the (iftl awarded to each lucky ticket-holder and the more tbe amount realised by the Library. To have a full drawln is so manifestly to the interest of those interested that, rather than have a fractional drawing on tbe 30th inst., I deem it due te the trust conffded to me by th' nk.t-hnldara and tha Public Library of Ken turky, that a short postponement be made to enable me to dispose of the unsold tickets and have a full drewinr. Though the very large amount now in bank would enable as to dis tribute handsome gifts, yet we should feel disappointed to tni. our last concert snouia we e compelled to make fractional draw in. hnw.vr IkrH.
