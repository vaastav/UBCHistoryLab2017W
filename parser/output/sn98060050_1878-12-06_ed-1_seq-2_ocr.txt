THE VERMONT PHCENIX & BllATTLEBOKO, E11IDAY, DECEMBER G, 1878. THE ritKSlDENT'S MESSAGE. Ftllnw VitlttM nftif ft wife mid Haute of IttprtntntttUttt :Onr licnrtfclt gratitudo is duo to tlio Dlvino llcing, who holds In His hands the destinies of nations, for thn contill. tied bestowal during tho past year of count lens blessings iiDoii our country. Wo aro lit pence with all other nations. Our public credit linn grcntly Improved, nnd is, perlinpii, now stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests havo rewarded tho Inborn of thoso Mho till tho noil, our manufacturing Indus trim nro reviving, and it in believed that gen eral prosperity, which has been ho long aux. lously looked for is at last within our reach. the vellow rr-VEn. Tho enjoyment of henlth by our peoplo generally has, how6ver, been Interrupted, during tho past season, by tho prevalence of n fatal pestilence, tho yellow fever, in somo portions of the Southern States, creating an emergency which calk it for prompt aud ex traordinary measures of relief. Tho diseaso appeared as nu epidemio nt New Orleans and at other places on tho lower Mississippi, soon nfter miil-summcr. It was rapidly spread by fugitives from tho Infected cities and towns, and did not disappear until early in Novem ber. Tho States of Louisiana, Itississippl and Tennessee have suffered severely. About one hundred thousand cases nro believed to have occurred, of which nbout twenty thous and, according to Intelligent intimates, proved fatal. It Is Impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy tho loss to the country occasioned by this epidemic. It is to bo reckoned by tho huudred millions of dollars. Thu suffering and destitution that resulted excited tho deepest sympathy In all parts of tho Union, Physicians nnd nurses hastened from every quarter to tho assistance of tho nlHicled communities. Voluntary contribu tions of money nnd supplies, in every need ed form, were speedily and generously fur liishcd. The governnunt was able to re hpoud in soma incnsuro to tlio call for help, by providing tents, medicines, nnd food for tho sick and destitute, tlio reipiisitu directions for tho purpose being given, in the confident vxpectatiou that this action of tin Executivo would receive tho sanction of Congress. About eighteen hundred tents, nnd rations of tho valuo of about twenty-five thousand dol lars, were sent to cities and towns which ap plied for them, full details of which will bo furnished to Congress by tho proper depart ment. Tho fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened a very general public sentiment in favor of national sanitary administration, which shall not only control cpinrautine, but huvc tlio sanitary supervision of internal com merce in time of epidemics, and hold an ad visory relation to tho Stain and municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whatever endangers tho public health, and 'which tho municipal and State authoritits aro unable to rigulate. Tho national ipiarautino net approved April 'J'.), 1878, which was passed too late in the last session of Congress to pro vide the iiiians for carrying it into practical operation, during the past scaton, is n step in tho direction hero indicatid. In view of the necessity for the most effectivo measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for tho protec tion of our seaports, and the country geuer nlly, from this and other epidemics, it is rec ommended that Cougress give to tho wholo Mibject early and careful consideration. TUB CONDITION OF THE SOUTH. The permanent pacification of tho country liy the complete protection of all citizens in very civil and political right continues to bo of paramount interest with the great body of our people. Every step in this direction is welcomed with public approval, and every interruption of steady nnd uniform progress to tho desired consummation nwnkens gener al uneasiness nnd widespread condemnation. The recent congressional elections havo fur Jiishcd a direct and trustworthy test of tho udvauco thus far made in tho practical estab lishment of the rights of suffrage, secured by the constitution to the liberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences, leal or imaginary, had been removed from all of these States. Tho throe constitutional amendments, which conferred freeelom nnd equality of civ il nnd political rights upon tho colored peo ple of tho South, were adopted by the con current action of the great body of good citi zens who maintained the authority of the na tional government and the integrity and per petuity of tho Union at such a cost of treas ure mid life, us a wise and necessary embodi ment in tho organic law of tho just results of the war. Tho peoplo of tho former slavo lioldiug States accepted theso results, and Have, in ev ery practicable form, assurances that the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth limeudmeuts, and laws passed in pursuance t hereof, should, in good faith, be enforced, rigidly and impartially, in letter and spirit, to thu end that tho humblest citizen, without elistiuction of ruco or color, should, under them, rcceivo full and equal protection in person and property and in political rights nnd privileges, lly tliesecoustitntioualameud lut'iits, tho boiitheru section of the Union ob tained n largo increase of political power in Congress nnd in tho electoral college, nnd tho e'ouutry justly expectid that thu elections would proceed, as to tho enfranchised race, upon tho sumo circumstances of legal and iiiisliliitioiiul freedom and prote-ctiou which obtaiucd in till tho other States of the Union. Tho friends of law and order looked forward 1o tho conduct of these elections, as offering to thu general judgment of the country an important opportunity to hictistiru the degree in which the right ot suurtigo coma ho exer cised by tho colored people, aud would be ro-rqiect- d by their fellow-citizens j but n more general enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by tho colored people, and n more just vnd gen erous protection of that freedom by tho com munities of which they form a part, were generally auticiputed than the record of tho elections discloses. In somo of thobo States, in which tho colored people have been una Mo to miiko their opinions felt in the elec tions, tho result is mainly due to influences not easily measure-dor remedied by legal pro tection; but in the States of Ijonisiaua and South Carolina ut largo, and in some particu lar congressional districts outside of tlioso States, tho records of tlio elections seem to compel tho conclusion that the rights of tho colored voters have boen overridden mid their participation in tho elections not permitted to bo cither general or free. It will ha for the Congress for which theso elections were held, to make such ex. amiuatious into their conduct ns may bo ap propriate to determiuo tho validity of tho ckiiins of members to their seats. Ill the nienuwhilc it becomes the duty of the execu tive aud judicial depurtme-uts of the govern ment, each in its province, to inquire into mid punish violations of the laws of the Uni ted States which havo occurred. I can but repent what I said in this connection in my last message, that whatever authority Tests with me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, nnd I am unwilling to forego a Ttniewed appeal to the legislatures,the courts, the executive authorities, and the people of tho States where these wrongs have been iierpetrutcd, to give their assistance towards iriuging to justice the offenders and prevent ing n repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged crimes, and to secure the conviction and just puuishmeut of the guilty. It is to be observed that the principal ap propriation made for the elepartmeut of jus tice at the last session, contained the follow ing cUuse; "And for defraying tho expenses -which may be incurred in the enforcement of the act approved February twenty-eighth, 4'ightoeu hundred and seventy-one, entitled 'An act to amend an act approved May thir tieth, eighteen huudred aud seventy, entitled 'an act to enforce the rights of citizens of the UuiUd States to vote in the several States of tho Union,' and for oilier purposes,' or any nets amend itory thereof or supplementary thereto." It is tho opinion of the Attorney General that the expenses of these proceed ing will largely exceed tho amount which -was thus provided, aud I rely confidently up on Cougrcss to make adequate appropriations 1o enable the executive department to en. furee the laws. I respectfully urge upon your attention th.it the cougn Ksiou.it dictions in every elis. trici, in n very iuipoituut sense, are justly n xuittt-r of political interest nnd concern throughout the wholo country. Each State, very political ptrty, Is entitled to the share of power which Is conferred by the legal and T.)u-titutio;uI suffrage. It is the right of ev ery oilizeu, possessing tho qualifications pre. KerilH.il by U, to cast oue unlntiulidated bal lot, au to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right aro common and equal, practically as well as formally, sub mission to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all tho alepartnieuU of government will (eel the true vigor of tho popular will thus expressed. No temporary or administrative Interests of gov ernment, however urgent or weighty, will ever displaco tho zentof our peoplo in tho de fense, of tho primary rights of citizenship. They understand that tho protection of liber ty requires tho maintenance, In full vigor, of tho manly methods of free speech, f rco press, nnd free suffrage, nnd will suststn tho full authority of government to enforce tlio laws wnicli nre frnmcit to preserve tneso inestima ble rights. The material progress nnd el- lure of tue Mutes depend on mo protection nfforded to their citizens. Tlure can be no pence without such protection, no prosperity without peace, ami tlio wiioie country u deeply interested in the growth aud prosper! tv of all Its narts. While tho country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling and reciprocal con flelenco between tho communities so lately nnd so seriously estranged, I feel nu nbsoluto nsstirnuco that tho tendencies arc in that di rection, and with increasing force. Tho power of nubile oiiluion will override all no- iitical prejudices, and all sectional or State attachments, in demanding that all over our wido territory tho namo and character of cit izen of tho United States shall menu one nnd tho sauio thing, nnd corny with them iinchal- lengcil security and respect. 1'OnEION BELAT10NS. Our relations with other countries continue peaceful. Our neutiality in contests between foreign Dowers has been maintained and re spectcd. Tho universal exposition held at Paris during tho past summer has been at tended by largo numbers of our citizens. Tho I t.. ! 1 ll 1 il. i! l unci periuei iiuuwcu lur iiiu preparation uuei arrangement oi mo contributions of our citi zens to this great exposition was well employ cd in energetic nnd judicious effoits to over come this disadvantage. Thesu effort, led nnd directed by tho commissioner general, were remarkably succcssiui, ami tlio exlubl tion of tho products of American industry wascrcditablciindgraliiytugln scopoaml char acter. Tho reports of tha United States coin- nusstoners giving its results iu detail, will lio duly laid before you. Our participation in this international competition for the favor nnd the trade of the world may bo expecti'd to proiluco useful ami Important results, iu promoting intercourse, friend-hip and com merce with other nations. Iu accordance with tho provisions of tho act of February 28, 1878, three commission. crs wero unpointed to an international confer dice on the subject of adopting n common rntlo between gold nnd silver, for the purpose of establishing, internationally, thu use of bimetallic money, nua securing tlxity of rela tive valuo between theso metals. Invitations were nddressed to the various governments wnicli una expressed u witiingucss to partici pato in Its deliberations, Tho conference held its meetings iu runs iu August List. The report of the commissioners, herewith sub. nutted, will snow its results. No common ratio between gold aud silver could be ugreeel upon by tho conference. The geneial con elusion was reached that it is necessary to lnuiutaiu In thu world tho monetary (line lions of silver as well ns of gold, leaving the sclcc. tion of the use of one or tho other of theso two metals, or of both, to be mado by each Shite. Cougrcss having appropriated nt its last session ine sum or ij..i,.i(M1,(K)U to pay tue nwai-a oi me joint commission nt Halifax, if. after correspondence with the llritish govern nieut, on tho subject of thu conformity of the nwnra io mo requirements of me treaty, nud to the terms of tho iiucstiou therebv submit tcel to tho commission, the Prcsielcut shall deem it his duty to make tho payment, com munications upon these points wero address ed to tlio ilritisn government through the le gation of the United States at Loudon. Fail ing to obtain the concurrence of the llritish government in the views of this Government respecting the nunrel, I have denned it my duty to tender the sum named, within thu year fixeet by the treaty, accompanied by a nonce oi me grounds or tlio payment, and n protest against any other construction of tho same, Iho correspondence upon this subject will be laid before you. The Spanish Government has officially an nounced tho termination of tho insurrection in Cuba, unit tho restoration of peaco through out that island. Confident expectations are cxpresseu oi a rev ival oi irado and prosperity, which is earnestly hoped may prove well founded. Numerous claims of American citi zens for relief for injuries or restoration of property, have been among the incidents of tno long-continued lOstuitic. Konie of these claims are iu process of adiustmeut bv Spain. aud the others are promised early and careful consideration. The treaty made with Italy, in retard to eeciprue-ui cuustuur privileges, uas ueeu cllliy ratified and proclaimed. No questions of grave importance have arisen with any other of the ruropenn power. llie Japanese Government has been desir. ous of a revision of such parts of its treaties wim loreign powers ns relate to commerce'. and, it is understood, has aildressed to each of the treaty powers a requst to opcu nego. tuitions with that view. The United States Government has been inclined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions up. on iraeie wiin japan nro louiut injurious io mat peoplo cauuot but affect injuriously nations holeliug commercial intercourse! with litem. .Japan, nfter a long period of seelu siuu, uas wiiiuu tm past lew yt iirs made rap id strides in mo path ot enlightenment and progress, mm, not unreasonably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be as. slmilatcd to those which they hold with each oiuer. a ircaiy looking to tins eiiet 1ms been made, which will be submitttd for the- consid eration of tho Senate. After au iutervul of several year, the Chinese Government has again sent envois to tho United Slides. They have been received, and n permanent legation is now established hero by that Government. It is not doubted that this step will be of ailviiutugu to loth na tions iu promoting friendly relations aud re moving causes of difference. The treaty with the Samoan Islands, having been duly ratified nnd' accepted on the part of both Govern ments, is now In operation, nnd a survey nnd soundings of tho harbor of l'ago-I'ago have been made by ft naval vessel of tho United States, with a view of its occupation as a na val station, if found desirable to tho service. Since the resumption of diplomatic rela tions with Mexico, eoncspoudenco has been opened and still continues between the two Governments upon tho various questions which at ouo time seemed to endanger their relations. While no foimnl agreement has been reached as to tha troubles on the bor der, much has been done to repress anil di. niiuish them. The effective force of United Stales troojis on the Hio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance) with instructions, lias done much to remove the sources of dispute, and it is now understood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other sido of the river is also making au energetic movement agaiust the marauding Iudiau tribes. This Govern ment looks with the greatest satisfaction up. on every evidence of strength iu the notional nuthority of Mexico, nud upon eve ry effort put forth to prevent or to puuihh incursions iqiou our territory. Itcluctant to nssumo any action or attitude in the control of these in cursions, by military movements across the border, not imperatively demauded for tho protection of the lives and property of our own citizens, I shall tako tho earliest oppor. tunity consistent with tho proper discharge of this plain duty to recoguiza the ability of the Mexican Government to restrain effectively violations of our territory. It is proKseii to hold next year au International Exhibition in Mexico, nud it is believed that the display of the agricultural and manufacturing products of the two nations will tend to better uneler standiug aud iucreased commercial Inter course between their people. With llrazil nud the republics of Central aud South America, some steps have been taken toward tho development of closer com. mercial intercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Colombia and with llolivia. A boundary question between the Argentlno ltepublio and Paraguay has been submitted by those government for arbitra tion to the President of tho United States, aud I liave, after a careful examination, given n elecUion upon it. A naval expedition up tho Amazon aud Ma deira rivers has brought back information valuablo both for scientific and commercial purposes. A like expedition Is about visiting tho coast of Africa and the Indian Ocean, The reports of diplomatic aud consular offi cers iu relation to the development of our foreign commerce have furnishes! many facts that have proved of public interest, and have stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise of our people, the tkeascbt. The report of the Secretary of the Treas. ury furnishes a detailed statement of the oj e rations of that department of the Govern. J incut, and of the condition of tho pnblio ft. nances.

It has been tlio policy of tlio Department to place tho four per cent, bonds within easy reach of '-'"J iiiiavu wiiu ue-MrtH lei mvesi 111s tav. ings, whether small or great, in theso securi ties. The Secretary of the Treasury re-coin ineiiils that tho laws bo so modified that small sums m.iy bo invested, and that, iiirougu 1110 post unices or other agents or tlio Government, the freest opjior tunity may bo given in all parts cf the coun try for such investments. The best mode suggesteil is mat llie department be author, izi'd to issue certificates of denusit of 11m .1... nomination of ten dollar, buiriug interest at thoiateof ft.

Such u provision of law. suniiorlr,! l,v .,it.. ble regulations, would enable any person rendily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into au inte nst-beaiiug security of tile United States, anil the money so r civ.l could be applied to the rediinptiou of six per eeui. uuiiecj. The coinage of gold during tho l.ut fiscal year was j.".2,7!l8,'.l80.

With views unchanged with regarel to the act n.,iuiuc vuiimc ui saver proceeeis, it has been the purpose of tho Se'critaryto faithfully execute the law, and to afford a fair trial to the measure. Iu tho present linan ciul condition of the country, I am persuaded that tho welfare of legitimate business aud inuusiry 01 every description win be best pro moted by abstaining from nil nttemjits to make radical ehanges in the existing fiuau- viim jt-Kismuuii. u ue uueiersiooei mat during tho coining year tho business of tho country will bo undisturbed by governmental interference with tho laws uflectiug it, aud vye may confidently expect that tho resump. tion of specie puynieul, which will take place at the appointed time, will bo success- ienj mm i hsiij iiiaiuiuiuc-ii, and mat it win be followed by a healthful and enduring re vival of business prosiierity. het tho heal ing influence of time, the inherent energies of our peoplo und the boundless resources of our country have n fair opportunity, nud re lief from present difficulties will surely fol. low.

In pro viding for tho jiotal service tho following questions aro presented: Should Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely In excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage bo csUibllshcel as will make the I)e)nrtmont self-sustaining V Should the postal service bo reduced by excluding from tho mails matter which does not pay Its wayf Should tho number of post routes bo diminished? Should other methods bo adopt cd which will iucreaso tho revenues or dimin ish the expenso of tho postal service f Tho International Postal Cougress, which met nt Paris, May 1, 1878, nud continued In session until Juuo I ot tho sauio year, was composed of delcgat.'S from nearly nil the civilized countries of tho world. It adopted it now convention to take the ptaco of tho treaty cone lude-el at Kcruc, October 'J, 1874, which gods into effect ou the 1st of April, 18711, between tho countries whoso delegates have signed it.

A synopsis of this Uulversnl Postal Convention will be found in tho report of tho Postmaster-Geuoral, aud the full text ill tho appendix thereto. Iu its origin tho Postal Union comprised twenty-thrco coun tries, having a population of throe hundred and fifty millions of p.-ople. On tho 1st of April next it wilt comjiriso forty-three coun tries and colonies, having a population of more than six hundred nud fifty millions of people, and will soon, by the accession of the fow remaining countries aud colonics which maintain orginizeel postal services, constitutu in fact ni well as in nun -, as Its new title in dicates, a Universal Union, regulating upon n uniform baeis of cheap postage rates tlio pos tal intercourse between all civitizcel nations. Soun- embarrassment lnu nris 11 out of the conflict b tween the customs laws of this country and the provisions of tho Postal Cou-ventio-i, in regard ti tho transmission of foreign books and n.weiip,'rs to this country by mail. It is hoped that Congress will bo able to ilovise souio moans of reconciling tho elifih'ulties which have thus be m created, so as to ilo jiisticu to nil parties involved. THE COUllTS. Th 1 bnsiu ss of the Supreme Court and of the Courts Iu many of tho circuits has In. creascel to such nu extent during tho past years that additional legislation is imp -ratUo to rcliuve ami prevent tho d -lay of justice nnd tiossihlo oppression to suitors, which is thus ojcasioued.

The ilise-emt.-i.t among the Ilauucck-i, which led first 1 1 some acts of violence on the part of soul.- lm-mbers of the tr.be nud fiuullv tu the outbre'iik, appears to have been eauseel by an iusiillk-ie hey of fooel 0:1 the reservation. and this insullieieiiey to have bee n owing to tho inaileiriaev eif the appropriations, made by Congress, to the wants uf the- Indiaus, at 11 time when the Indians were jireventeil from supplvinq the efficiency by hunting. After au arduous pursuit by the troops of tho Unit- eel States, and several engagements, tlio hos tile luel. uus were reduceel to subjection, ami the larger part of them surreuelercil them selves as iirisoners. In this connection I de sire to call attention to thu recommendation made by the Secretary of tho luterior, that a sulucieut fund be placeet at the disposal of the Exe'Cittive. to be Used with proper accounta bility, at discretion, in sudden emergencies of the Indian service. The other case of elisttirbauce w as that of a band of Northern Cheyenne a, who sueldeiily left their reservation iu the Indian Ten itory and marched rnpUIr through the States of Knusas anil Nebraska in the elirectiou of their old htiutiiig.grouuels, committing murders ami other crimes 011 their way. From ilocuments accompanying the report of the Secretary of tho Interior it appears that this disorderly baud was as fully siqqilitil with the neces saries of life as the four thousaiiel seven hun dred other Indians who re-uueiniil epiietly 011 thu reservation, nud that the disturbance wus citiseil by meu of a restless and mischievous elispeisittou among the ludi.il a themselves. Almost the whole of this band Lave surren elered to the military authorities, nnd it is 11 gratifying fact, that, when som of them hud taken refuge iu tho eiimp of the Keel Cloud Sioux, with whom tlu-y hud b en In friendly relations, tho Sioux held them ns pri-oners nuel nudity gave them up to Ihe oifieers of the United States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, nUrming rumors to the con trary uotwithstamliug, they lmvu uniformly shoeiu ever siue-e the wislus theyexpresseelnt the Council uf September, 1877, had been coiuplieelwitli. Hoth the Secretary of the Interior and tho Secretary of War unite iu the ree-ommeuehi-lion that provision be; made b) Cougress for Iho organization of u corps of mouuteel "Iu ili.01 auxiliaries," to be under the control of the urmy, ami to be usoel for the purpose of kei p lug tho Iudiaus on their resenutious nuit pre. venting or repressing disturbance ou their jiart. I earnestly coucur iuthisrii-omuienela. tiou. Itisbelieveel that the organization of such a body of Iudiau cavalry, receiving a uieHlerato pay from the Government, wouMcousielerubly weaken the restless element uniting tho lit eliaus by withdrawing from it a number of young men and giving them congenial em ployment under tho Government, it being a matter of exjiorience that Inelians in our ser vice, aluiost without exception, are faithful iu tho performance' of the duties assigned to them. Such uu organization would material ly aiil tho army in the accomplishment of a task for which its liuiiurie-aWtriiigtli is some times found insufficient. Hut, while the employment of force for thu prevention or repression of Iudiau troubles is of occasioual pecessity, auel wise preparations should be made to that cud, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing agncies for the ultimatj solution of what is called tho Indian problem. It may be very difficult and require much patient effort to curb the unruly spirit of thu savage Iudiau to the restraints of civilized life, but experience shows that it is uot impossible. Many of tho tribes which are uow quiet anil orderly and self-supporting, wero once as savage as any that at present roam over the plains or iu the mountains of the Far West, anil were then considered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the whito populaiou of tho United States, but we should not forget that they aro the aborigines of the couutry, and c-illeel tha soil their owu on which our people have grown rich, powerful and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to help them iu attaining at least that degree of civilization which tuey may be nblo to rench. It is not only our duty it is also our interest to do so. Indians who nave become agriculturists or herdsmen, aud feel an interest iu property, will thenceforth ceaso to be a wnilikunud dis turbing clement. It is also a well autlitnti-e-uteel fact that Indiaus aro apt to be peaceful and quiet when their children are nt school ; nud 1 am gratified to kuow, from tho expres sions of Indians themselves, nud from niauy concurring reports, that there is a steadily in. creasing desiro, oveu nnioug Indians belong, ing to couiparatively wild tribes, to have their children educated. I invite attention to tho reports of the Secretary of the Interior and tho Commissioner of Indian Athens, touchiug the experiment recently Inaugurated, iu tak. ing fifty Indian children, bojs and girls, from different tribes, to the Hampton Normal Ag ricultural Institute in Virginia, where they uro to receive eleiucntnry Euglish education nud training Hi agriculture and other useful work, to be returned to their tribes after tho com pleted course, as Interpreter, instructors aud examples. It la reported that the officer charged with tho selection of those children might have had thousands of young Indiaus sent with him had it beeu possible to make provision for them. I agree with tho Secre tary of the Interior in saying that "the result of this interesting experiment, if favorable, may bo destined to become au iuqwrlant fac tor Iu the advancement of civilization amonc the Indian." Tho question whether n change In tho con trol of the Indian service should bo mado was. nt tho Into session of Cougress, refcrreil to a Committee for inquiry and report, Without desiring to antlclpato that report, I venture to express tho hopo that In tho ilocislou of so important n question, tho views expressed nbovomnyuot bo lost sightof,nnd that tho de clslou. whatever It may be, will arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to proiluco n disturbing effect 011 tlio scr. vico ns wen ns 011 1110 inuiun themselves. the hot nrniNns commission. In tho enrolment of tlio bill making appro pnations for sundry civil expenses, nt the IubI session of Cougress, that portion which provided for the continuation of tho Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As tha CoiiimUslou had completed the work of tak ing testimony ou tho many eonllicliug claims, the suspension of their labors, before detenu. lulng tha rights of claimants, threatened for a tinio to embarrass the interests, not only of thu government but also of a largo number 01 1110 citizen 01 not springs, who were waltlug for final notion 011 their claims bo. foro beginning contemplated improvement.

TIMllKn I.AMiS. I Invite tho attention of Cougress to tho rocomuieudations mado by the Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the timber oil the public lauds of the United StuU s. The protection of tho public property is ono of thu first duties of tho erov. crnuieut. Tho Depaitiiieiit of tho luterior should, therefore, be enabled by sufficient approptiations, to enforce tho laws iu that 10- spett. Hut this matter appears still more iin, portent us a iiuestion of nubile mmmiiv Tho rapid destruction of our forests is au evil fraught with the gravest consequences, (specially in Ihe mountainous districts, where uie rocsy siojies, once denueled uf their trees, will remain s forever. There tho injury, once done, cannot bu re-paired. I fully con. cur with the Secretary of tho luterior iu tho opinion that, for this reason, legislation totiehing the public limber in tho mountain, ous Slates .-mil Territories of the West should ne specially wed considered, aud that exist iug laws, iu which the elestructlou of tho for. ests Is not sufiieie nlly guarded against, should be speedily modified.

Iu projKjrtion oa nations advance 111 population aud other circumstances cf ma. tunty this truth becomes more apparent, and renders tho cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage. Insti. tulious for promoting it grow up suportcd by the public purse and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the me-ans which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than tho establishment of Hoards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting ami diffusine- infnr. matioti, and enabled, by premiums and small pecuuiary aid, to encourage and assist the spine in discovery ami improvement, Ihm sjiecies of establishment contributing doubly to the improvement by stimulatinc? to enter. prise nuel experiment, aud by drawing to a common c.-utre tho results everywhere of in dividual skill and observation, and spreading them thence over tho whole nation. Experi ence accordingly has shown that they are cij i-uenji iiisiniiiieiiis oi imuieuso national bniefit." The iris it preponderance of thn nr. ricultural over any othor interest iu the United States entitles it to all tho considera tion claimed for it by Washington. About one. half of the population of the United Stutes is engaged iu agriculture. Tho v aluo of thu agricultural products of tho United States for the yeur 1878 is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. Tho oxiwrts of agricultural products for the year 1877, as appear from tho report of the llureau of .Statistics, were five hundred aud twenty-four millions of dollurs. The great extent of our couutry, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce within our own bor elers and by our own labor, not only tho nec essaries but must of the luxuries that are con sinned in civilized countries. Yet, notwith standing our advantages of soil, climate and intercommunication, it appears from the sta tistical statements in the reiiort of tho Com niissiouer of Agriculture that we import an uually from foreign lauds many million of dollars' worth of agricultural products which could bo raised in our own country. Numer- uus ijucsviuuH arise iu me practice 01 nuvauc eil ngriculture which can only lie answered by experiments, often costly aud sometimes fruitless, whicli are beyond tho means of nri. vute individuals, and aro a lust and proper charge on tho whole natlou.

Tho efforts of the Depart, incut of Agriculture) to stimulate old nud iu. troduce new ngricultural industries, to im. prove tho quality auel increase the quantity of our products, to determine tho valuo of old or establish the importance of now methods of culture, are worthy of your careful nud fa. vombie cousieleration, ami assistance liy such appropriations of money nuel enlargement of iiie-iiiiie-s as may seem to ne aeuianded by tho prcsout favorable conditions for the trrowth and rapid development of this Iniporttut In- terest. 

CRUELTY TO ANIMALK. The abuse of animals iu transit is widely attracting public attention. A notional cou. veutiou of societies specially interested in tlio subject has recently met nt Baltimore, and tho facts developed, both in regard to cruelties to animals aud tho effect of such cruelties iqwu tho public health, would seem to demand tho careful consideration of Con. gress, and the enactment of more efficient laws for the prevention of theso abuses. EDUCATION. Tho report of tho Commissioner of the Uu. reau of Education shows very gratifying progress throughout tho country, in all the interests committed to the care of this im portant office. The report is especially en. couraglug with respect to tho extension of the advantages of the common school system in sections of the couutry -where the general enjoyment of the privllego of free schools is not yet attained. To education more than to any other agency are we to look, ns the re. source for tho ndrnucement of the peoplo, in ,uu inmjBHo Auuwriruge uuu lipprcciuuon OI their rights and responsibilities as citizens : aud I desiro to repeat the suggestion contain, cd in my former message in behalf of the en. actinent of appropriate measures by Con. gress ior tue purpose 01 supplementing, with uatiouhl aid, the local systems of eduoation in tho several States.

As iuis iiurary is national in its character, and must, from the nature of the case, increase oven more rapidly in thn future than in the past, it cannot bo doubted that tlio people will sanction any wise expenditure to pro. servo It nnd to enlarge Its usefulness.

It. II. Hayfji. Eilcutive Mansion, Dec. 2, 1878. IHtATTLEIiOKO: 

FHIDAY, DECEMllElt C, 1878. It is beyond question that Gov. Proctor made an excellent selection in tho appoint ment of Col. John 11. Mead of Itandolph as su perintendent of agricultural affairs, under the new law. Instead of a reduction, tho November pub lic debt statement shows au iucreaso of three million two hundred nnd odd thousand dol lars. For this we linvo to thank the gener ous Fisheries Commission. Since June last tho debt has been reduced nearly eight nnd a half million dollars. In accordance with tho suggestion of tho Secretary of tho Treasury. Mr. Morrill of this State has introduced a bill in tho Senate providing for tlio issue of certificates of de posit ns low ns ten dollars iu exchange for coin or United States notes bearing interest at tho rnte of :i n.100 per cent per annum nud convertible into four per cent bonds. Provieled the preseut status is not nltereel by contests, tho total number of Itepublicans electid to tho next Congress from Southern State1, exclusive of Maryland nud Missouri, is five ono from Florida. Tcuuesseo nud Vir ginia respectively auel two from North Caro lina. Compared with the present Congress, this is n loss of ono In Tennessee, one iu Ioiiisianu nnd threo In South Carolina. Hon. E. II. Powell, the new State auditor. gives notice that his main office will be kept nt Moutpelier, from which all salaries nnd fixed allowances w ill bo paid by order, nnd where nil matters of routine will bo attended to. Tho Auditor will be nt Moutpelier on tho first nnd third Thurselays of tnch mouth, when ho can be consulted upon matters re ipiiring a personal iutcrview, aud at other times nt Ilichford. Mr. Illaine introduced a resolution in tho Senate, on Monday, prov iding for an investi gation into the Southern election outrages. At a caucus of Democratic senators held in tho evening it wns decided to ngreo to this, provided the scope of the inquiry be mado to cover tho Northern elections ns well. The ltepuhlicaus will not object to this feature. nud the investigation will probably bo mado by a special committee, with Senator lllaino at its head. Freel Douglass takes a candid and sensible view of the Southern situation. He tells au interviewer that "time, uot bayonets," is tho remedy; "exhaust all civil processes, bring cases into court, even with a certainty of fail urethey then will attract attention, bo tried out of court, nnd public opinion will bo edu. cate-d." Already he sock improvement in the condition of his race in tho border States, nml the same change must come, sooner or later, further South. As for tho "solid South," ha pronounces it n bugbear; "now that the southern whites havo rcgameel lKiht- Ical power, it is impossible that they can long agree." The only business of pressing importance before the Congress which met for its closing session ou Monday, is the possago of the ap propriation bills necessary to keep the ma chinery of tho government iu operation, lloth houses, however, havo full calendars. and what with the possibilities involved in fi nancial questions, aud with tho discussion of political matters pretty suro to arise from tho President's referenco to Southern affairs in. his message, the session promises to be livoly enough, and Its members can hardly bo ex pected to obligo and relievo tho country by adjourning beforo tho body ceases to exist ou the 4th of March next. President Hayes evidently believes that tlw tinio has como when useless repining for tlw past, and equally useless and uncalled-for ap prehension for the future, should be laid on side, and the people should awake to a com fortable enjoyment of the blessings of peaca and returning prosperity, which they actual ly have, and are likely, with reasonable pru dence and energy, to keep. This sentence from the opening of his message, should bo posted In every household : "Abundant har vests have rewarded the labors of those wlu till the soil, our manufacturing interests aro reviving, and Uas btliCTed thatscneral prosy perily, which has so long been nnxlously looked for, Is nt last within our reach." After tlio President's messngo hnd been rend In tho Honso, on Monday, Fernando Wooel of Now lork, In moving thnt It bo rc fcrrcd to tho Committee of tho Whole, nnd printed, mndo a bitter attack on that portion of tho mcsMigo which refers to tho outrages In tho Southern States, paying that ho failed to sco nny disposition on tho part of the South to annul tho recent constitutional amendments. Garfield of Ohio nnd Halo of Maine mado vigorous replies, assorting that tho President would have been gullly of neg lect had he failed to call tho nttcntion of Congress to tho fnctet, This ntlnck of Wood 011 tho President Is not endorsed by tho Southern members nnd is generally disap proved of by his party colleagues, as they bclievo that their, best course lies In ignoring political discussion ns fnr ns possible. Hon. J, li. Martin of Londonderry seems to havo oven moro than fulfilled tho brilliant anticipations entertained of him by his friends upon his election to the Speaker s chair in tho recent Legislature. Tho testi mony of tho members is uniform to tho fact thnt ho enjoyed tho fullest confidence nml gooel will of the wholo House throughout tho session, thnt his ruliugs wero invnrinbly just and Impartial, nnd Hint ho exhibited n faculty for tho prompt and rapid discharge of busi ness which has not been surpassed by any predecessor In that office. The handsome and valuable gifts which wero presented him during tho closing night of tho session wero evidently a geutiino expression of cordial re gard and good feeling on the part of his fel low members. This record is one in whicli a young man may justly cherish n feeling of honest pride nnd satisfaction. Tlir lrrldrnt'. .Ties. !--. President Hayes's second aunual message, given iu full in our columns to-day, is notablo for its caution, moderation, and gooel sense, rather than for its bolducss nnd origiunlity. On tho Southern question its languago is frank aud explicit. Tho facts compel the conclusion that iu Louisiana aud South Caro lina, ns well as in certain districts outsido of thoso States, tho rights of tho colored people in the recent elections wero overridden, nnd thnt their participation in theso elections wns not permitted to bo either general or free. Asa matter of simple) justice to itself, to tho col ored peoplo nud the country, tho President calls on tho next Congress to enquire, strictly into the claims of those who have been elect ed to seats under theso circumstances, while for himself ho avows nepiiet de-termination to enforce the laws sustaining the equal rights of all citizens to the best of his ability. Tho evident spirit of regret In which the subject is treated, and tho entire disregard of all con. sidcratious of party advantage nnd partisan feeling, should disarm the question of all feeliugs of bitterness, and secure for it the candid nud unprejudiced attention of falr mindeel men of both parties. Excepting the Southern question and the recommendation of precautionary measures against the intro duction of pestilence, tho niessago is chiefly devoted to a brief history of our foreign in tercourse nud n recapitulation of the leading points iu the several department reports aud indorseuicut of their recommendations. The President expresses n firm and confident be lief iu tho success of resumption uuder tho laws as they stand, and elocs not desire any importaut changes iu them at this session. "Iu Iho present financial condition of the country," hu says, "I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate business and industry' of every description will bo best promoted by nbstaiuiug from all attempts to make radical changes in the existing financial legislation. Let tho healing influence of time, the inher ent energies of our people, and tho bound less resources of our couutry have a fair op portunity, and relief from present difficulties will surely follow." Tho tone of tho message is cheerful and courageous, and tho careful reader will rise from its perusal with renew, cd faith in the future of the country, both from a material and political point of viow. Tlir IVurle oflbr LrrUluture. Tho supplement which wo publish this week, containing the laws enacted by the Legislature of 1878, will give our readers au opportunity for judging as to the practical re sults of the late session. The boely which adjourned last week has been subjected to about tho usual amount of fault-finding and adverse criticism, but wo suppose tho real fact to bo that it contained an average amount of ability aud intelligence amoug its members, aud that as gooel work was douc as we can everexiiect while the present practice pre v ails of sending men to the legislature who, with very few exceptions, aro entirely new to their work, lliat this Legislature was sincerely desirous of showing itself au econom ical boely there can bo no iiuestion, but the trouble seomeel to be to know where to be gin to economize, aud the total result of its efforts to reduce Stato expenses apparently consists iu a small reduction which has been mado in the salary of certain Stato officers, iu the regulation of certain court expenses, nud in n cutting down of the cost of the State printing. We uotico that in several emarters charges arc mado that, toward tho closo of tho session, tho Se-nato refused, through jeal ousy or otherwise, to concur with tho House in attempts at lopping off expenses. Amoug tho most important measures enacted are the law taxing deposits Iu Savings banks, the tramp law (which seems to us needlessly weak iu its provisions), tho act providing for mort gages of personal property, tho act regulating divorces, aud tho act abolishing tho Stnte Hoard of Agriculture aud substituting in its placo a State Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs. Tho control of the Stato Prison and Workhouse is now cousolieltteel iu ouo boarel of trustees to be appointed by tho Governor. The trustees of the Itefonu School nre also to be appointed by the Governor hereafter. Heretofore these officers have been elected by the joint assembly. Of the prcciso nature of the legislation enacted relative to the Stato insane, and the insane asylum, wo nre not yet fully informed. It is understood, however, that a law was passoel at the last moment, ap propriating an additional fifty cents per week, for tho care of the Stato insane, as asked for by tho asylum managers, and providing for a boarel of supervisors, iu placo of a Stnte Com- missiouerof tho insaue, who havo authority in the matter of tho commitment of persons to the asylum ami their elischargo from it. Drs. Harrington of Halifax, Cramptouof Col chester aud W. II. Walker, Esq., of Ludlow, were chosen such board of supervisors. A very excellent law was passed relative to tho general organization nud management of tho savings banks of tho State, an abstract of which we shall give in a future issue. Tho people of Memphis, in a lame and enthusiastic public meeting held iu that city ou Thanksgiving Day, passed resolutions of thanks to thoso peoplo, organizations and corporations who aided the stricken city in its hour of need. General Humes in his speech said 1 "The recent liberality of the North, showing one ot the brightest illustrations of tins rare nobility of conduct to bo found In history, was so free, so prompt, so ample, so beneficent, and tho appreciation, by the peo pie of Memphis, of this conduct on the unrt of their Northern aud Southern friends, so keen, so fervid, that languago cannot add a single tint to the beauty of the former nor a ray to the warmth of the latter."

Tho chancel of tho church was beautifully decorated with autumn leaves, grasses, fruits nud vegetable. At the closo of the service tho rector made a brief address suitable to tho day. Many acceptable and useful gifts wero sent to the church by differ ent parishioners for tho rector's family. Sav ings bank depositors may not nil be nware that the recent legislature enacted a law which requires all the savings banks iu the Stato to pay all the tax on deposits. This tax is one-half of ono percent., auel is all the tax which can bo collected by Stato or town. Under the new law depositors can have .2000 in tho bank in oue name, but this provision . does not affect deposits already made which exceeel this amount. All deposits are now exempt from individual taxation. Wo have every assurance that Siguor Patrizio, who appears at the town hall next Monday evening, accompanied by Mine. Pa trizio iu her remarkable feats of iustantauo ous memory, is ouo of the most marvellous of conjurors, and the entertainment which he will give will be by far the most wond.-r-ful of its kind ever offered here. Tho Buffa lo Commercial Advertiser, a careful and reli able journal, says of Patrizio that "he is ful ly the eipial of the world-renowned Hermann and far more startliug than Heller." At the session of the U. S. District Court, held by Judge Wheeler at ltutlaud on Wednesday, an application was made to have a elecreo for the orator entered in the organ case. Judge Wheeler said, however, that, as the ensa was heard by tho circuit and district judges sittiug together, the question ns-totho decreo should bo heard by them both. By consent of counsel the matter is to be hennt at New York on the 17th iust., when, at the same time a motion of the defendants for a re-opcuiug of tho cuo to hear further evi dence will also come beforo Judges Illatch foril and Wheeler. It would trouble tho "oldest inhabitant" to tell w hen moro water has fallen hereabouts iu the same length of time than fell last Mon day afternoon and evening. Duriug the lat ter part of the afternoon aud early ejvetiing tho rain cniuo steadily down in torrents, and tho result was a rapid rise of Whetstone brook nud more or less damage to all tho roads in this vicinity. Tho bank wall on Canal street was washed out for a distance of :io or 40 feet, a break was caused iu two of the nque ducts nenr cave bank, Frost's meadow was overflowed, the wnter coming up to Flat street, a bridge nenr Curtis' shop nt West Ilratlleboro was carried away, aud both Cur tis'B and Fisher's dams at that placo wero in jured, while uumerous minor losses nnd elatn ages aro rejiorted. Somo fears were enter tained for the safety of Estey's building near the bridge, aud the battery removed their guns from its basement. A bad washout is reported ou the stags road near tho Marlboro line, and there were numerous holes and gul lies mado on tho river rood to West Duin merslou. Tho storm subsided as unexpected ly ns it came up, nnd whereas, at 7:!t0 in the evening the rain was fulling heavily, at 8::i0 the moon was shilling brightly aud mild and balmy airs prevailed. Wednesday brought tho first snow storm of the season, but the snow melted nearly as fast as it fell. It has seemed to us, as we kuow thnt it has to many impartial aud fair-minded citi zens, that au excellent opportunity off 1 red on Monday evening, iu the nomination of Mr. A. J. Siraonds for first bailiff, to quietly Ig. noro the factional feeling which has so loug divided and disgraced this community, aud to elect a man of whom it could bo safely said that ho wets nobody' "man" or "adho. rent." Aud we believe that, as a beginning in tho right direction, it was a mistake that tho opportunity was not" accepted. Tho question at issue was not by any means as to tho fitness of Col. Fuller for tho chairman, ship of the board of bailiffs. It has never beeu disputed that, two years ago, ho made a faithful aud efficient village officer, nor Is it doubted that he will this year exhibit tho namo qualities as then. It may havo been perfectly natural that his friends should wish to see him "vindicated" but all such imper tinent considerations aside, the real question was whether tho sympathizers of both sides should not for once drop all personal feeling and uuite to elect an independent man on his own merits, or becauso the community in general had confidence iu him. That ono man was elected and another defeated is no cau6o of grief or disappointment to us, but wo feel It to be high time that every self-re. spectiug citizen should once and for all sink tho question of factional interest or support
