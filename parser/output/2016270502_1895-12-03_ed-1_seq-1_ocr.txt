VOL. VIII. NO. 308 WATERBUHY, CONN.. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1895. PRICE TWO CENTS PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. DEVOTED MAINLY TO FINANCES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS. Conrinced that the Only Remedy For Our Trouble is to Cancel United States Notes and Treasury Notes Under Free Coinage the Wage Worker "Would Find the Dollar Scaled Down to the Foint of Disappoint ment or Frivation The Tariff Folicy Based on Sound Principles. "Washington-, D. C, December 3. The president's message to congress, which was read to-day, was a shorter document than usual. It contains be tween 13,500 and 14,000 words. The following is a carefullj' prepared digest of the message, embodying all the salient points touched upon by the chief executive : To the congress of the United States : "The present assemblage of the legis lative branch of our government occurs at a time when the interests of our peo ple and the needs of the country give a special prominence to the condition of our foreign relations and the exigencies of our national finances. The reports of the heads of the several administrations fully and plainly exhibit what has been accomplished within the scope of their respective, duties, and present such recommendations for the betterment of our country's condition as patriotic and intelligent labor and observation sug gest. I, therefore, deem my executive duty adequately performed at this time by presenting to the congress the im portant phases of our situation, as re lated to" our intercourse with foreign nations, and a statement of the financial problem which confronts us, omitting, except as they are related to these topics, any reference to departmental operations. Referring to the tariff bill passed by the fifty-third congress, the president says : "By amendatory tariff legislation in January last, the Argentine Republic, recognizing the value of the large mar ket opened to the free importation of its wool under our last tariff act has ad mitted certain products of the United States to entries at reduced duties. It is pleasing to note that the efforts we have made to enlarge the exchanges of trade on a sound basis of mutual bene fit are in this instance appreciated by the country from which our woolen fac tories draw their needful supply of raw material." Referring to the Chinese-Japanese war, the president says : "Although but one American citizen was reported to have been actually wounded, it plainly be hooved this government to takes the most prompt and decided action to guard against similar, or perhaps more dread ful calamities befalling the hundreds of American mission stations which have grown up throughout the interior of China." The president says the customary cor dial relations between this country and France have been undisturbed, with the exception that a full explanation of the treatment of John L. Waller by the ex peditionary authority of France still re mains to be given. He believes that the matter will be satisfactorily adjusted. Referring to our trade relations the president says that the halting tardiness of this country in inviting a freer ex change of commodities "and by this means impairing our looting in the ex ternal markets naturally open to us, has created a situation somewhat injurious to American export interests, not only in Germany but in adjacent countries. The exports affected are largely Ameri can cattle and other food products, the reason assigned for unfavorable dis crimination being that their consump tion is deleterious to the public health, although no European state is as jealous of the excellence of its exported food supplies as the United States. The presi dent suggests that congress take some steps to right this wrong. Our relations with Great Britain, al ways intimate and important, have de manded during the year past even a greater share of consideration than usual. Several vexatious questions were left undetermined by the decision of the Behring sea arbitration tribunal. Much correspondence has been exchanged on various subjects pertaining to the trouble and in most cases the results have been satisfactory. The president recommends that the slaughter of seal herds be effectively checked and says that unless this is done their extinction within a few years seems a certainty The president says he is still of the opinion that the refusal of the last con gress to confirm the understanding by which the United States was to pay Great Britain a lump sum of four hun dred and twenty-five thousand dollars in full settlement of all British claims for damages arising from our seizure of British sealing vessels was injudicious. The president goes into the bouudarv dispute between Great Britain and the republic of Venezuela concerning the limits of British Guiana, and the part the United States has taken in the matter. He says that the British government has not yet replied to the dispatch sent by the United States, asking for a definite answer to the question whether it would or not submit the territorial controversy i j. : 1 ' j -- i J ueiween iiseu. uuu v euezueia to impar- uai aruiirauon. The president refers to the uprising against the government of Hawaii last January, reviewing the part taken in it by an alleged American citizen. He mijs niuu me iauis in fume cases war ranted claims for indemnity which have not yet Deen received. The presidpnt. says further that Mr Thurston, the Ha waiian minister, furnished this govern ment abundant reasons for askincr that, he be recalled, and that course was pur sued. He suggests that legislation be en acted to wipe out the pernicious padrone i. i . i . i .. . By&icui wiucn orings so manv-worthless Italian emigrants to this country. lie reters to the trouble in Cuba and says that there was an earnest effort made to enforce obedience to our neu trality laws and to prevent the territory of the United States from being used as a vantage ground from which to aid those in arms against Spanish sov ereignty. The president says that no matter what the S3'inpathies of the people of this country may be for people struggling for their liberty it is the plain duty of this government to observe in good faith the recognized obligations of international relations. The massacres in Turkey are referred to. The prescuce of our naval ves-i sels which are now in the vicinity of the disturbed localities affords us, the president says.opportuuities to acquire a measure of "familiarity with the condi tion of affairs, and will unable us to take suitable steps for the protection of any interests of our countrymen within reach of our ships. On the demand of our minister, orders have been issued by the Sultan that Turkish soldiers shall escort ; to the coast all American refugees. - j The question of improvement of the consular service is treated at length. A j higher average of efficiency is urged and j legislation providing for consular in spection is, in the opinion of the presi dent, imperatively required. Fully three-fifths of the message is devoted to the question of finance. The president says : "By command of the people a customs revenue system designed for the benefit and protection of favored classes, at the expense of the great mass of our coun trymen, and which, while inefficient for the purpose of revenue, curtailed our trade relations and impeded our entrance to the markets of the world has been superceded by a tariff policy which, in principle, is based upon a denial of the right of the government to obstruct the avenues to our peoples' cheap living, or lessen their comfort and contentment for the sake of according a special advantage to favorites and which, while encourag ing our intercourse and trade with other nations, recognizes the fact that Ameri can self-reliance and ingenuity can build up our country's industries and develop its resources more surely than enervating paternalism. "The compulsory purchase and coin age of silver by the government un checked and unregulated by business conditions and heedless of our currency needs, which for more than fifteen years diluted our circulating medium, under mined confidence abroad in our financial ability, and at last culminated in dis tress and panic at home,has been recent- j ly stopped by the repeal of the laws ; which forced this reckless scheme upon the country. The things thus accom plished notwithstanding their extreme importance and beuificent effects, fall far short of curing the monetary evils from which we sutler as a result of long indulgence in ill advised financial expedient.-'' The president then reviews the his tory of the greenbacks and refers to the issuance of gold bonds. , "In July, 1890, an act had been passed directing larger governmental purchases of silver than had previously been required. It was declared in the act to be 'the established policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity.' In view of the same it was not deemed permissible for the secretary of the treasury to exer cise his discretion by refusing to pay gold on tnese notes when demanded, because by such discrimination the parity of the two metals would be de- stroj-ed and grave and dangerous conse quences be precipitated. It thus re sulted that the treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the law of lb'JO were necessarily treated as the gold obligations at the option of the holder. These obligations are the instruments which, ever since we have had a gold reserve, have been used to deplete it." '1 he president says:- "It has from April, 1S93, gradually reduced the re serve up to the present time except as it has been temporarily replenished by the sale of bonds. Among the causes for this shrinkage is the great falling off' of exports under the tariff law until re cently enforced, and necessitated to some extent the payment of our bal ances in gold. The unnatural infusion of silver into our currency, and increas ing agitation for its free and unlimited coinage which have created apprehen sion as to our disposition and ability to continue gold payments, and the conse quent hoarding of gold reduced our gold reserve and made an issue of bonds ne cessary." He says the third issue of bonds restored confidence. How long, the gold reserve will remain large enough to render its increase unneces sary is a matter of conjecture. Every one of the 346,000,000 United States notes is still uncancelled. Added to this the government has in curred a bonded indebtedness, the annual interest or which is more than . eleven million dollars, and the continuance in our present course raav result in further bond issues. We are threatened with all this for the sake of supplying gold for foreign shipment or facilitating home hoarding, a situation exhibited which ought to arrest attention and pro voke immediate legislative relief. "I am convinced that the only thorough and practical remedy for our trouble "is found in the retirement and cancellation of our United btates notes and the out standing treasury notes issued in pav- mem oi suver purcnases. this could be accomplished by exchange for United States bonds of small as well as larsre denominations, bearing a low rate of in terest. They should be long term bonds. postponed to a period removed from present financial dilhculties." "Authority should be given the secre tary of treasury to dispose of bond? abroad for gold is necessary, permitting him to use the proceeds for the cancel lation of notes or received by the cov ernment. The increase of our bonded debt would be compensated by renewed activity in business circles and retored confidence at home and renewed faith in our monetary strength abroad. I think national banks should be allowed to issue circulation equal to the par value of bonds deposited by them, and that the tax on their circulation should be re duced to of one per cent. They should be allowed to substitute in lieu of the bonds now required those which would be issued for the purpose of retir ing United States and treasury notes." The cancellation of the treasury notes issued under the silver act would leave the treasury owing 8178,000,000 in silver dollars, which might be slowly con verted into fractional coin and put into circulation. It would be impossible for the secretary of the treasury to buy gold on any terms above par, as it would break down the parity between gold and silver. The president vigorously opposes the free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1. There is certainly no ' ground for a belief that congress could bring an equality of 50 per cent between gold and silver nor is there the least possibility that our country could by its action alone raise silver to its lost ratio with gold. Every wage worker would find the dollar in hand scaled down to the point of disappointment or privation, and there would be a collapse of the entire system of credit. "Those who advocate a blind plunge to free coinage in the name of bimetallism are certainly reckoning from a cloudy standpoint. While the value of gold as a staudard is steadied bv almost uuiversal commercial use, it does not despise silver nor seek Its banishment." "I cannot rid myself of the belief that there lurks in . the proposition for the free coinage of silver so- enthusias tically made by a multitude a serious menace to our prosperity and an insidious temptation of our people to wander from the alle giance they owe to public and private integrity. I cannot refrain from beg ging them to re-examine their .views in the light of patriotic reason and familiar experience and to weigh again the con sequences of such legislation as their efforts have invited. Even the contin ued agitation of the subject adds greatly to the difficulties of a dangerous finan cial situation. "In conclusion I especially entreat the people's representatives . in congress, who are charged with the responsibilitv of inaugurating measures for the safety and prosperity of our common country to promptly and effectively consider the ills of our critical period. "I have suggested a remedy which my judgment approves. I desire, how ever, to assure congress that I am pre pared to co-operate with them iu per fecting any other measure promising thorough and practical relief, and that L will gladly labor in every patriotic en deavor to further the interests and guard the welfare of our countrymen, whom in our respective places of duty we have undertaken to serve.

FELL INTO A CHARCOAL PIT. Five Men Kendered Insensible ly Deadly Fame, and Three Will Die. Bf.ooki.tn, Dec. 3. Three men will die as the result of a remarkable accident in the Mollenhauer sugar refinery at the foot of South Kleveuth street, Williamsburg. Two others narrowly escaped with their lives and may be laid up for some time. Mollenhauer's refinery shut down last Thursday to take account of stock and put the machinery and boilers in condi tion. It was announced that the refinery would' resumo operations today. Last evening at 7 o'clock a number of charcoal workers were "ordered to begin work in the underground charcoal pits, which, when in active operation, are generally closed. Five men went into the pits, which are 20 by 50 feet in oxtent, the roofs being 18 feet above the flooring. As the thick fumes of the charcoal, which had accumu lated for several days, struck the men they fell down insensible, one after the other, in single file. The two men nearest the sunken door were pulled out and revived after a time and went to their homes very ill. All in formation being refused by the officials of the refinery, the names of these two vic tims could not be learned until a late hour last night. Fellow workmen broke the windows from tho outside of the pits, and after the atmosphere had cleared hauled out the following: Herman Fuchs, 28 years old, 75 Morgan avenue. Thomas Kohlmann, 27 years old, 148 Malborn street. Thomas Levy, 38 years old, 229 Lea avenue. To all appearances they were dead, but were attended by Ambulance Surgeon Shaw of the Homoeopathic hospital and Dr. John Mahr of the Eastern District hospital. Fuchs and Kohlmann were taken to tha hospital first named and Levy to tha Eastern District hospital, and it was re ported late last night at both of those in stitutions that the men would surely die.
