IT i- api a-ent that IHE Call has turned the attack on Judge McKerma r.ni that its promoters are in retreat. Publicity in sucU a matter brings the issue to the test, and publicity, which secured wiae attention to the insufficiency of the charge-, ended the movement. It may now le calmly examined and treated in an admoni tory spirit. In the attack was an inspiration opposed to genuine Americanism. At bottom tie objections to Judge MeKenna were based upon his self-culture and the tact that from his childhocd to tnis n-ument he has been bravely reliant upon himself for his advanc ment in life. Without a wealthy or powerful patron, with no inherited material resources, with as bieak a start in life as any Ameri can boy ever made, he has never from the beginning taken a false step nor a backward one. A consistent member of his party, he was allied to none of its various machines nor found trading with any of itsbos-ts. For personal advancement In public life he depended solely upon his cwn presentation of the principles of his party and his cause tv to educate the people into their adoption. When f.entiment wbs against those prin ciples he was :oierant to its manifestations, but continued his campaign of education with an earnestness and fairness which did not fail at last to bring victory to him and his party. Ob jection was made that he had been in politics. Pray, what men were mon in politics prior to their elevation to the bench than Taney, Chas-e, Levi "Wocdbnry, Da\id Davis, John If. Hnrlan, Lamar, Howell Jackson, E D. White or PecKham? It is not that a man has bten in poetics, but his bearing therein. It is a peculiarity of American politic* that it calls for law yers, and Rreat lawyers, 100. This is not the casein England, where every act of Parliament is a part of the constitution and where there is no written fundamental law. Here we have the system of written constitution?, Federal and Slate, and tarty issues and legislative acts must be dis cussed and considered in the light of their conformity to those written instruments. This involves continual construction and interpretation of the constitut on in politics and legisla tion, and is a necessary invitation to lawyers to enter politics and brine training in the rules of legal construction into tbe discussion of policies and laws. Hence it is that in politics a lawyer has a great field in which to display the judicial mind. Therefore a man may give the Inchest evidence of judicial fitness In the most active participation in politics. All m«n who recall Judge Me- Kenna's career will remember tnat through it all he showed the even working of a mini judicially poised. Those who have known him best know that he would not have hesitated to an tagonize a policy of his own party if it were flagrantly in capable of reconciliation to the just principlej of constitutional construction. It is in essence a training for the bench to have been in that fashion in politics, and for that reason wise men In the Presidency have never hesita'ed to take men with long re cords iv active politics for the b?nrh. 

NATIONAL DEFENSES. REPORTS from Washington are to tbe effect that compir atively small appropriations will be made this year tor navy and coast defenses. Leading members of both houses are quoted as savin? the increase of the navy wilj probably b° limited to one battle-ship and a few torpedo-boats and expenditures for defenses will be reduced much below the amcuists ai-ked for by the administration. Several reasons are assigned for the proposed reductions. The controversy between the Government and the manufac turers over the cott of armor plate has caused many memoers of Congress to hesitate about providing for more armored ships until the plate can be obtained on bet:er terms. The lack of sufficient docks to care for the ships already built has Influ enced others, and the lack of trained artillerymen to handle th c guns of the coast batteries* now erected is urged as a rea«on why i«o turlher batteries should be establish ed until the uttt* 1 cry arm of tue military service has been increased sufficiently to man them. In addition to the reasons cited there is the further one that in the opinion of many Congressmen the expenditures of the Government should be limited to strictly necessary works until the deficit caused by the Democralic depression shall have been paid eff and the revenue of the country restored to the normal Republican basis. It is regarded as well nssured that two regiments of artillery will be added to the army, the enlist ment ol a thousand additional men in the navy will be authorized and s me of the docks recommended by Secretary Long; will be provided, but very little more in the way of coast defense or naval increase will be undertaken. This being the tone aad temper which prevail in Congress, it is a gross absurdity to enter upon any scheme ior annexing Hawaii If we cannot afford coast defenses on our own shores we certainly cannot afford them on aa island 2000 miles away. If we most delay the fortification oi ports wnere we already own the ground on wnich to e.ect the batteries, it would be lolly to assume the Hawaiian debt of $4 000,000 and then ex pend another large sum to fortify Honolulu. The great naval station the British have erected nt Esqui raalt and the strong batteries they have constructed to defend it constitute the only point from which the Pacific coast of the United States need fear ageres*ion, and no guard against that aggression would be afforded by torts or navy-yards at Hawaii. We need a h.r.jer navy, better navy-yards, more batteries and more guns along our own shores; and until we are able to pro vide for them on a scale cumnn'nsurate with the importance of our coast ciues the expenditure of money on far-off islands would be a military folly of the worg' kind. The re-election of Chief Lees did not come to him in the nature of a surprise. When he kissed and made up with Commissioner Gunst he was not doinj ii just for fun, or because of the winning naiuie of (Junst. If the ppectacular suijide realized what a tiresome exhibi tion his exit constituted, in pity for the rest of the worid. who can't help noting the display, he would consent to live for pty's sake if nothing else. What an opportuniiy for greatness President McKinley overlooked in not announcing that he had changed his mind and no longer regarded the looting of Hawaii en statesmanship. Final adjudication of the Byttie property has occurred again. It lias occurred so often that tne public feels ac quainted wi:h it and always welcomes it a* an old friend. Judge Morrow's act in disbarring an attorney does not meet unanimous approval. It h understood that the altorney objects. THE SAN 

FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, IS9T. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. CONSEkVATISM is the dominant characteristic of tbe President* message. It oontains nothing of a nature to disturb the business interests of lha country, and much to strengthen and promote the alr.-ady well-advanced movement toward prosperity. There will be, of course, d fferences of opinion concerning the recommendations made in reeard to the main issues of the time, and soineol them are justly sub ject to criticism even from the most loyal Republicans, but in the main the message will be read witb gratification and approval. The President begins by congratulating the country upon the disappearance from our politics o! sectionalism and the parti sanship that grew out of sectional antagonism. He then etiiers at once neon consideration of the pressing issues of the time and puts currency reform rirst among tne acts to be expected of this session of Congress, this constituting the salient and mo*i important feature of his recommendations concerning strictly domestic policies. The Cuban quostion is elaborately reviewed and the an nouncement made that, while the administration does not deem it ad vifabe nt this time to recognize either the inde pendence or the belligerency of Cuba, it will carefully guard the rights of American cit zens endangered by the war and use earnest efforts to bring abuut a speedy restoration of peace on terms that will be just and honorable to both Spain and Cuba. As was foreseen, the President recommends the annex ation of Hawaii, but charges Congress to provide for it in such a way ai to prevent the "abrupt assimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet tilted to shara In the highest fraochisea of citizenship." Recognition is given to the importance of an early com pletion of the Nicaragua canal, but recommendations in regard to it are defined until the commission appointed to make surveys, pans and estimates shull have :e; orted. The work of the monetary commission appointed tone.otiate an inter national conference on the silver question is commended, and the Prcsiaent expresses the earnest hope thai ''their labors may result in an international agreement that will bring about recognition ot both gold and silver as money upon bticn terms and with iacb safeguards as will secure the use ol boih metals upon a basis which shall work no injustice to any class o; our citiz >ns." Rapidly, but with sufficient f'Jllness to make his recom mendations clear and comprehensible, the President deais with the issues involved in the organization ot Aiatka, recip rocity, the upbuilding of our merchant marine, the protection of the seal fisheries, the increase of the navy and coast defenses, the Paris exposition, the debts of the Pacilic railroads, tr.e controversy with the Greater Republic of Central America over the appointment of Minister Merry, tne conditions of Indian Territory and the improvement of tho civil service. Comparatively few of the recommendations of the Presi dent involve issues ot party politics. Nearly all of them are matters to whose consideration the people will come with impartial minds. It is in that way The Call win discuss them iv detail, each as it arises, until tbey are finally settle!. For the present it is suOuient to say the President has added to our record ol Presidential state papers a strong and able document, and even those who disagree with his recommenda tions will find in its earnestness and its vigor unmistakable evidences of his genuine statesmaiishiu and thorough Ameri canism. 

EVIDENCES OF CONSPIRACY. GRADUALLY the details of the corporation conspiracy to thwart the adoption of a charter for this city are being niadu public. An account of tlie difficulty among Mr. BucKley's "businessmen," published in The Call of Sunday, gives tue people a clear insight into the plans of the associated villainies for bringing the proposed charter into disrepute. It is evidently the intention to produce by foul means the public disgust necesiary to render the defeat of any instrument cer tain. The Buckley Democrats, who now call themselves the "Citizens' Democratic Party," took part in the last campaign as "anti-charter Democra s." Not only did they openly op pose the adoption of the charter eubmitted at the election of 1596 but they ran aii anti-charter candidate for Mayor upon an anti-charter platform. These Democrats are managed by Chris Buckley. They comprise the remnant of the political machine with which he formerly ruled the city, but which went lo pieces upon his indictment by the Wallace Grand Jury and his flight to Europe. Recorder Glynn is Mr. Buckley's stage manager. He is charged by ?ome of bis own "business men" with having turned their organization over to the Examiner in consideration of future support I y that sheet. As the latter is advocating the election of the Freeholders' ticket nominated by the Citi zens' Charter Convention, the first contract fulfilled by Mr. Glynn has been the indorsement by the Buckleyite- of a por tion of that ticket. This indorsement hns produced an open revolt. To t c credit of some of the "business men" it must ba said they object to an alliance with the yellow journal. They know that t at meet is a confidence organ; they know th.it it will seil them to the associated vulanies just as it sold its readers to the Southern l'acitic; hey Know that it must hnve some job in supporting the charter convention Freehold ers, for it never drew an honest breath in its life, and so they have revolted aeaiu-t Mr. Glynn's rule. Being "business men" the Buckley Democrats are too clever to be fooled by the yellow sheet. How this Democratic difficulty results, however, is of little consequence. The combatants are few in number and possess small influence. But the trouble they are now fomenting is of inestimable significance to the public. It demonstra es to one who reads between the lines that I lie Examiner is at the head of a corporation conspiracy to defeat a new charter; that in or der to carry out itn nefarious contract — for which, doubtless, it will, in due time, receive a fat fee — it does not scru; le to unite with liosx Buckley and his "business men,' 1 of whose meetings it is now giving long and respectful reports; thai it is support ing the Freeholders of the Charter Convention merely to give its movement a respectable fliror; that, in short, it is putting up a Job on tLe people not only to defeat any charter, but to bestuiich and discredit the decent men of the Citizens' Co mmittee who are accepting its cilice-. The burning question now before the public is thi<: What do the members of the Charter Commi t cof One Hundred pro pose to do about it? Are they willing to accept the support of the Examiner and the Buckley Democrats without questioning their motives in forcing themselves into respectable society? Do they wish the people to understand that this disreputable sheet is their acknowledged organ? Is their campaign ior re form to be made on the batii of a $30,000 contract for editorial silence? The public is anxiously awaiting answers to these questions. The members of the Cit zens' Committee canno' expect anybody to vote their ticket until they have either an swered thorn or repudiated the leadership of the scurvy crowd which Is now heading their movement. Cubans are assured by Spain that the autonomy granted them is a first-class article, warranted not to rip, ravel or tear, but somehow they do not seem to credit it. Thi9 Jack of faith i* not to be wondered at. bnanis i tfficiais i avc been lying ever since the war began, and if they expect to be believed now they must give a toad. Not that a priz?- fighter is of any importance save as a nuisance to be abate 1, yet Stiarkey's recent remark that he has whipped ev.-ry man on the earth worth whipping does excite intere t. How he happened to do this without anybody having found it nut is well nigh inexplicable. Boys in Cincinnati schools nre being taught how to cook. Perhaps this is a good idea. Since the girls are being trained to every manner of work formerly done by males, it is only fair to give the boys a show in one of the few fields now left to them. German Runs are trainel upon Haytl and the peop'e of that community are beginning to cxi e.-ience a foeling of dis comfort. However, the interference whicu Uncle Sim was to project into the situation is still on col 1 storage. It seems after a!l that there are two sides to the story of Armenian outrage*, but the Turks were backward about rush ing their side into print. PERSONAL.

London Tit- Hit*. Tne recent experiences ol I'rinco Max of Sax ony In the ranks of misMoners in tht> East-end of Lotiduu have draw: attention to the fact that ho is not the flr?t, oven in modern days, of princes who have taken to the ministry of tho church as their life* work. Prince Max of Saxony comes from an ola Catholic family, and came to work among the lar,-e band (f German Catholics in the Whitecnapel district. Speaking both German and E lglish fluently, he has bean of great ser vice to stranded foreigners in that overcrowd ed part of London. Hi* sermons aie of an average length, extempore of course, persua sive and indicative of much thought. There i* un exmnpeoi an English I'rinc 1 becoming a clergyman. Cardinal Yorke, the rin l twin Roman Catholic prelate, who died in 1809, .mi- i be son 01 int.- O.d Pretender, James 1-M .Mir i Stuart, aud hence the grandson o. our James 11. lie was the i«st Prince, direct and legitimate, of the Stuart family, but gave up hit political life and ambition;; tv wore for the Calm ■lie church as a priest, and filial. be came a cardinal. One of the mosteffec'iveof the royal preach ore of to-day is Prince Oscar, nephew of the King of Sweden, who has joined tba Salvation Army division in that country. Botn he and h s wife, the Prlnce-s, conduct meetings in ihj open air in Stockholm and elsewnere, which, of c< ur«e, draw immense crowds. I'll nee Oscar preaches and prays at these meetings, while the Princess leads the ring ing. He is said to have a capital voice, a very Uucnt delivery, and to b ' especially keen upon putting his points before his audience in the cieareit possible manner. It may be tresh in the memory of our readers that *orne lew years ago the Prince attended the Jubilee of the Young Men's Christian Association la London anJ addressed a meeting there. That famous man of many parts, the German Kaiser, is suit to have more than once "preacned" to his own privates family, though there is no record of his having done so pub licly from tne pulpit. hut it is well known tint he has on several occasions given the Court chaplains both subjects and directions lor their sermons. Of English peers there are several well known members, the heads of famous families, who are either clergymen or who frequent. address religious meetings. Oae of the beat-known and most widely re spected of the M th; venerable Earl of Devon, who is the rector of I'owderhnm. near Exeter. His lordship had been a clergyman for some years before, by the deatn of tne last Earl, he became possessor of his present title. Like most younger relative ; ol a peer's family, he had entered holy orders as his profession, i and in due course- been inducted into one of | the fa.nlly livings. The Marquis of Norra&nby, of Mulgrave I Caste, Whiibr, is not only a clergyman who I preacue* eloquently, bat is a private school master of high repute in the north. Probably j his a.id (ski to youth* of pood position have ; laid the foundation of h s effective sermons to . older people. At any rate, few aristocratic preachers have equal renown in Northern England. Lord Kadstork has long been known for his deep interest In all kinds of evangelistic work, He has had a wide experience of mission wortc ; in large towns and In slum districts in many pans of the country, and there are few preach* ers of the aristocracy who are listened 10 by worklngmen with more respect and attention. His sermons are marked by thoughtful treat ment, by their clear lucidity and by their in tense earnestness In setting form Gospel truths L >rd Overtoun's name is well known In fcotland, and no Scottish peer has more prac tical experience of preaching than his lord ship. 

BRITAIN'^ MINERAL WEALTH. Mature. An account of the quantity and value of the minerals obtained from the mint 8, quarries, brine-works, etc , In the United Kingdom dur ing the year 1896 is given in a Bluo Book just issued by tic lit me Office. Many fac.s 01 in terest are co .tamed in the report, in addition to the Ma;iMic.tl i. (formation, tat the limita t ons of spme will "nly permit us to rei*r to a tew 01 them. In 1890 the tow 1 output 01 com was 196.381,260 tons; of this amount 930!) tons were ob aincd irom open quarries. Tna ser.ms worked in England vary irom eleven to twelve incuc. to thirty icet in tnicknes*. and in Scotland seams ot rannel coal Oily six inches In thicfene«s are being worked. Tho only mine worked tor cobnlt and nickel ore is in Flintshire, and after being idle for several years it has lately been reopened. The mine nrT.rds an instance of the occurrence of the mineral absolane with red clay in irregu lar cavities in the carboniferous limestone. Copper mining is rapidly decreasing in im portance In Britain, only 9108 tons having . i-«»n produced in 18'JG, whereas the output in 1803 was '210,000 to.is. F.i Nt mining Mia survives at Brandon, in Suffolk; the produce tit a few shallow mines wonted in a most primitive fasnion suffices to supp'v the gradually diminishing demand lor gun flints, which «re exported to savage co'in tr.es. Ref.-rring to cold ore the report points out that compared with the yield of the colo nies nad many countries the amount of gold obtained in Britain Is Insignificant; neverthe less mineral veins In North Wales liave irom time to time furnished considerable quanti ties of rich numerous auariz. In 1896 the five mines in Merioneth ire produced 8700 tons 01 ore, from which 1352J-£ ounces of gold, havirta a value oi £5035, were obtained. This, however, is a muci> lower output than that of th previous year. The pr ncipal iron-producing districts at the present time me Cl-vrland or North York shire, yielding over 000,000 tons annually, and Cumberland m.d N-rtfi Lancashire, with an output of over '.2, oOiU>oo tons. Tne Cleve l»na ore» is an ear.ny c.iroonate. containing about 30 per cent of metal, while the red hem atite «j| the two other cou ties yields 50 to 60 percent. The total quantity oi iron ore ob« tamed :rnm on' mines and quarries last year was 12,500,000 Ml I
