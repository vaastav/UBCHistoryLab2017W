The rumor of great loss by death from j.h'iint jmetiimmht among the cattle of Texan, is almost without foundation.

An evidence of the condition of the money market may lie had by referer.ee to the raid on a railroad train in Texas on the 11th inst. Two men boarded a train near IVlleview, and after searching the p:.senger-. succeeded in getting only $liM).

A great aruiy, w hich had cotjiiuere-l in a series of battles tint finest troops of the age, was disorganized and ruined by the luxury an 1 leisure won by its own victories. So the Democratic party of the South stands in danger of destruc;-. tion by its overthrow of the Republican opposition. Kvery where the house is becoming divided against itself, ami when that is an accomplished fact it re quires no prophet to predict the result. To us who U-lieve that the principles of Democratic policy are essential to the well-being of our government, such a future seems full of danger to the whole country, anil the thoughtful Democrat looks earnestly for shelter from the com ing storm. In Virginia it has already burst. In Tennessee and (Jeorgia the clouds are plainly visible; in Mississippi anil Alabama the rumble f the thunder is in the ears of a people divided and Jismayed; in Florida we see no cloud and we hear no thunder as yet, but the air is full of electricity. Despite the im mediate and immense benefits which have accrued to the State, the Dis?ton sale is stilt condemned; the railroads which were lately hailed as saviors, are reproached as tyrants; the destruction of the enemy has invited to u? the camp followers whose fingers only itch for spoils, and the disgust felt for these strangi companions are learning many, who nto:l staunchly during ditliculty and danger, to look elsew here for deliv erance than to the iclitical gods of the past. It is vain to preach unity to u-, as the cry ot "peace, jieacc" was vain in the ears of Patrick Henry. There can lie no unity based solely on n !f interest. tlie preservation u jMiwer or tin suc cessful manipulation of convention and elections. A great party must have a common tie touching the constant faith and daily practice of all, or it becomes a mercenary army like that of Hannibal, and, like it, liable to disorganization and destruction at the llrst moment of leiri ure or immediately on the removal of a pleasing dang r. i'nlike that army, we jiossc-s no great leader whose ability we can trust, who is easily lirst in our con fidence and airection, in whose rise or fall we can lake an abiding interest : s partisans. In the South the common in ed of help against a common enemy has lieen removed by the departure of the earjiet-lMggcr and the elimination of the negro vote. Something must take the place of this common tie or the party will fall to pieces as a ImmIv decays when the principle of life departs. What shall touch the heart f each Democrat, with tnc vivifying truth essential to party life, bind him to his fellow- and separate him from h:senemv'r Some of our contemporaries U iieve that this e immon ground for all Demo crats is marked out in the President's message. I'.ut we m ed much more than this. Within the lines there laid down Mr. Cleveland may conduct a siicces- fill administration, lb can improve the business methods of the dilIVret:t do pai tmeiits, lift us from the sl ugh of ex travagance into which the Republicans had fallen, secure the modification and reduction of the tai'll'. and probably command a re-nomination. I hit even all this and much mote of the a un kind, will only insure the building up of one man's jMiwerand usefulness, rot the growth of the IVmocratie party nor the rehabilitation of parly l iu s. Mr. Cleve land may le tin Moses who has led us from the wilderness and g"ve us rules for jxditical molality, but he is surely not the Joshua who can lead us to new conquest and blow down the walls of the enemy's strongholds. When he leaves us on the hound try of the land of promise, . n , we stand where we did liefore. and must tlu u make t he light if we would not wander yet again in the desert.

In the allotment of seats in the House Mr. Cox si cured a des:rnble seat in the fronl row. He was kept busy most of the time in nceivipg the congratulations of his former associates, and his countenance woie a look of contentment which clear- ' ly indicated that he w as pleased to find himself once m re upon the lloor of the I louse.
