If you can show them you are right, they will stand by and support you. But the difficulty is in being able to "show" 1 them. Unless you can call upon each one individually—which is an absolute impossibility —you must resort to some means of publicity. There is no :. publicity equal to or so effective as newspaper publicity. It is better than ^circular letters, pamphlets posters or anything else. Besides when the cam paign is on voters are deluged with that sort of publicity and they are forced to lay much of it aside.

ONLY DEMOCRATIC DAILY NEWSPAPER IN NORTH DAKOTA The Devil's Lake Journal Is the only democratic dally newspaper in the state. It is now in Its seventh vear and is firmly established.

Xo doubt we shall all wish, and the country will .expect, this to be the central subject of our deliberations during the present ses sion but it is a subject so many-sid ed and so deserving of careful and dis criminating discussion thijt I shall take the liberty of addressing you up on it in a special message at a later idate than this.

I mean the method of selecting nomi nees for the presidency of the United States. I feel confident that I do not misinterpret the wishes or the expec tations of the country when 1 urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections throughout the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the presi dency without the intervention of nominating conventions. I venture the suggestion that this legislation should provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formu lating the platforms of the parties and I suggest that these conventions should consist not of delegates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the senate of the United States, the senators whose terms have not yet closed, the nation al committees, and the candidates for the presidency themselves. In or der that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people for carrying them into effect. Philippine Policy. These are all matters of vital do mestic concern, and besides them, out side the charmed circle of our own na tional life in which our affections command us, as well as our con sciences, there stand out our obliga tions toward our territories over sea Here we are trustees. Porto Rico, Hawaii, the Philippines, are ours, In deed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such territories, once re garded as mere possessions, are no longer to be selfishly exploited they are part of the domain of public con science and of serviceable and en lightened statesmanship. We must administer them for the people who live in them and with the same sense of responsibility to them as toward our own people in our domestic af fairs. No doubt we shall successfully enough bind Porto Rico and the Ha waiian islands to ourselves by ties -of justice and Interest and affection, but the performance of our duty toward the Philippines is'a more difficult and debatable matter. We can satisfy the obligations of generous justice toward the people of Porto Rico by giving them ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own citizens in our own territories and our obliga tions toward the people of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions for self government already granted them, but In the Philippines we must go further. We must hold steadily in view thtflr ultimate independence, and we must move toward the time of that inde pendence as steadily as the way can be cleared and- the foundations thoughtfully and permanently laid. Perfect Plan Step by step. Acting under the authority confer­ it 1 .v '. S and a strong champion of decency and law enforcement. It has been a suc cess from the day it started, and has been steadily growing. It is recogniz ed as one of the leading newspapers of the northwest. The Weekly Jour nal was established in 1904, two years before John Burke was elected gover nor, and John Burke is one of the original stockholders of the paper. The Journal has never had to ask for gratuitous contributions or "help" from the democratic organization. It has-only asked democrats to sub scribe for it. 

BEST NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED IN CITY SIZE DEVILS LAKE The Journal is not the largest news paper published in the world, or in North Dakota, but it is* the BEST newspaper published in the world in a city the size of Devil's Lake. This statement is made without fear of successful- contradiction—not In a boasting way, but as a simple state­ .u •. THE EVENING TIMES, GRAND FORKS, N. D. red npon the president by congress, I have already, accorded the people of the island^ majority In both houses of their legislative body by ap pointing five hlqtead of four native citizens to .the sft»embershlp of the commission, ijfoliievc that in this way. we shall make proof"of their ca pacity in counaef and their sense of responsibility In Tthe exercise of poli tical power, and, tha 1 the success of this step will be sure to clear our view I for the steps which ure to follow. {Step by step we should extend and perfect the system of self-government I in the islands, making test of them and modifying them as experience I discloses'their successes and their fail lures that we should more and more put under the, control of the native {citizens of the"archipelago the essen tial instruments of their life, their local instrumentalities of government, their schools, all the common Inter jests of their communities and-so by counsel and eperience set up a gov ernment which all the world will see to be suitable to a people .whose af fairs are under their own control. At last, I hope and believe, we are be ginning to gain the confidence of the FlHpino peoples. By their counsel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn how best to serve them and how soon It will be possible and wise to withdraw 011 rsupervlsion. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and confident tread upon it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it. Government Railroads In Alaska. A duty faces us with regard to Alas ka which seems to me very pressing and very imperative perhaps I should say a double duty, for it concerns both the political and the material develop ment of the territory- The people of Alaska should be given the full terri torial form of government, and Alas ka, as a storehouse, should be un locked. One key to it is a system of railways. These the government should itself control in the Interest of all who wish to use them for the serv ice and development of the country and its people. Rut the construction of railways is only the first step is only thrusting in the key to the storehouse and throw ing back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is an other matter, .to which I shall take the liberty of from time to time call ing your attention, for it is a policy which must be worked out by well considered stages, not upon theory, but upon the Unes of practical. expe diency. It is part of our general prob lem of conservation. We have a freer hand In working out the problem in Alaska than In the states of the union and yet the principle and object are the same, wherever we touch it. .We must use the resources of the coun try, not lock them up. There need be no conflict rjealousy as between state and federal authorities, for there can be no essential direrence of pur pose between them- The resources in question must be used, but not de stroyed or wasted used, but not mon opolized upon any narrow idea of In dividual rights as against the abiding interests of communities. That a pol icy can be worked out by conference and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopard or dissipate them, I for one have no doubt and It can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less ac ceptable to the people and govern state ments of the states concerned than to the people and government of the nation at large, whose heritage these resources are We must bend our counsels to this end. A common pur pose ought to make agreement easy. Three or four matters of special im portance and significance I beg that you will permit me to mention In clos Ing. Improve Mine labor Conditions.
