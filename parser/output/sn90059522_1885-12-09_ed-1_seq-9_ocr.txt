To the Congress of the United States: Your assembling i.- clouded by a sense of public bereavement caused by the recent and sud den death of Thomas A. Hendrieks, vice president of the United States, His dis tinguished public services, his complete integrity and devotion to every duty, and his personal virtues, will find honorable record in his country's history. Ample and repeated proofs of the esteem and confidence in which lie was held by his fellow countrymen were manifested by his election to the offices of the most important trust and highest dignity, and at length, full of years and honors, he has been laid at rest amid universal sorrow and benediction. The constitution, which requires that those chosen to legislate for the people shall annu ally meet in the discharge of their solemn trust, also requires the president to give to congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as ho shall deem necessary and expedient. At the threshold of a compliance with the constitutional directions, it is well for us to bear In mind that our usefulness to the people's interests will be promoted by a constant appreciation of the scope and the character of our duties as they relate to fed eral legislation. While the executive may recommend such measures as he shall deem expedient, the responsibility of legislative action must and should rest on those selected by these laws. The contempiation of THE 

GRAVE AND RESPONSIBLE FUNCTIONS assigned to the executive branches of the government under the constitution will dis close the partitions of power between our respective departments and their necessary independence, and also the need for the exer cise of all the power intrusted to each in that spirit of comity and co-operation which is es sential to the proper fulfillment of the patri otic Obligations which rest upon us as faith ful servants of the people. The jealous watchfulness of our constituents, great and small, supplements their suffrages, and be fore the tribunal established every public servant should be judged. OCR FOREIGN RELATIONS. The Government on Amicable Terms. With Ail Powers. It is gratifying to announce that the rela tions of the United States with all foreign powers coutiuuo to bo friendly. Our posi tion, after nearly a century of successful constitutional government and the mainte nance of good faith in all our engagements, the avoidance of complications with other nations, and a consistent and amicable atti tude toward the strong and weak alike, fur nish proof of a political disposition which renders prole— of good will unnecessary. Then are no questions of difficulty pending ■with any foreign government. THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT lias revived the long-dormant question of the Falkland islands by claiming from the United States indemnity for them. The loss is at tributed to the commander of the sloop-of war Lexington in breaking up a practical col ony on those islands in I*3l and tlieir subse quent occupation by Great Britain. In view of lie ample justification lor the act of the Lexington and the derelict condition of the islands before and after their alleged occupa tion by Argentine colonists, this government considers the claim as wholly groundless. A question has arisen with the government of Austria-Hungary touching the representa tion of the United States at Vienna. Having under my constitutional prerogative ap pointed our estimable citizen of unimpeached probity and competence as minister at that court, the government of Austria- Hungary Invited this government to the cognizance of certain exceptions based upon allegations against the personal acceptability of Mr. Keiley, the appointed en voy, asking that, in view thereof, the ap pointment should be withdrawn. The reasons advanced were such as could not be acqui esced In without violation of my oath of office and the precepts of the constitution, since they necessarily involved a limitation in favor of a foreign government upon the right of selection by tiie executive, and re quired such un application of a religious test as a qualification tor office under the United States us would have resulted in the practical disfranchisement oi a large class of our citi zens and the abandonment of a vital principle of Our government. The Austria-Hungarian government finally decided not to receive Mr. Keiley as the envoy of the United States, and that gentleman has since resigned his com mission, LEAVING THE POST VACANT. I have made no new nominations, and the luterests of this government at Vienna are now in the care of the secretary of legation, acting as charge d'affaires ad interim. Early in March last war broke out in Cen tral America, caused by the attempt of Gua temala to consolidate the several states into v single government. In this contest between our neighboring states, the United States forebore to interfere actively, but sent the aid of their friendly offices in deprecating war and to promote peace and concord among the belligerents, and by such a council con tributed impartially to the restoration of tranquility 111 that locality. Emergencies growing out of the civil war in the United States of Columbia demanded of the government at the beginning of this administration the employment of an armed force to fulfill its guarantee under the thirty tlfth article of the treaty of Is4tl, in order to keep the transit open across the Isthmus of Panama. Desirous of exercising only the powers expressly reserved to us by the treaty and mindful of the rights of Columbia, the forces sent to the isthmus were instructed to confine their actions to '•POSITIVELY AND EFFICACIOUSLY" preventing the transit and its accessories from being '-interrupted or embarrassed." The execution of this delicate and responsi ble task necessarily involved police control where the local authority was temporarily ' powerless, but always iv aid of the sover eignty of Columbia. The prompt and suc cessful fulfillment of its duty by this govern ment was highly appreciated by the govern ment of Columbia, and has been followed by expression of its satisfaction. High praise is due to the officers and men engaged in this service, the restoration of peace on the isth mus by the re-establishment of the consti tuted government there being thus accom plished. The forces of the United States ■were withdrawn. Pending these occurrences a question of much importance was presented by decrees of the Columbian government pro claiming the closure of certain ports and then in the hands of the insurgents, and iv declar ing vessels held by the revolutionists to be pi ratical aud liable to capture by any power. To neither of these propositions could the United States assent. An effective closure of the ports, not in the possession of the gov ernment, but held by HOSTILE PARTISANS, could not be recognized; neither could the vessels of the insurgents against the legiti mate sovereignty be deemed hostis huma ni generis, within the precepts of international whatever might be the definition and pen alty of their acts under the municipal law of the state against whose authority they ■were In revolt. The denial by this government of the Columbian propositions did not. bow ever, imply the admission of a belligerent status on the part of the insurgents. The Columbian government has expressed its willingness to negotiate conventions for the adjustment by arbitration of claims by foreign citizens arising out of the destruc x±E ST.

The interest of the United States iv a prac ticable transit for ships across the strip of land separating the Atlantic from the Pacific has been repeatedly manifested during the last half century. My imniwUate pie.ieoet hor caused to be negotiated with Nicaraugan, a treaty for the construction by and at the sole expense of the United States, or a canal through the Nicaraugan territory, and laid before the senate. Pending the action of ■ thai body thereon. I withdrew the treaty for re-examination. Attentive consideration of ■ Its ptpvisions leads me to withhold it from re- 1 submission to the senate. Maintaining as I ! do the Tenets of a line of presidents from Washington's day, which proscribe entan irliinr alliances with foreign states. Ido not favor a policy of acquisition of a uew and distant territory or the Incorporation of remote interests. Our own laws of progress are vital and or ganic, an.l we must be conscious of that irre sistible tide of commercial expansion which, as the concomitant of ourown activo civiliza tion, duy by day is being urged onward by those Increasing facilites of production.lraus port;ition and communication to which steam and electricity have given birth. But our duty in the present instructs us to address ourselves mainly to the development of tha vast resources of the great area committed to our charge, and the cultivation of the arts of peace within our borders, though jealously alert In preventing the Amer ican hemisphere from being involved in the political problems and complications of distant governments thereon. 1 am unable to recommend propositions involving para mount privileges of ownership or right out side of our own territory, when coupled with absolute and uulitnited engagements to de fend the territorial integrity of the state where such interests lie. While the general prospect of 

CONNECTING THE TWO OCEANS by means of a canal is to be encouraged, I am of opinion that auy scheme to that end, to be considered with favor, should be free from the features alluded to. The Tehuautenee route is declared by engineers of the highest repute, anl by competent scientific men, to afford an entirely practicable transit for vessels and cargoes by means of a ship railway from the Atlantio to the Pacific. The obvious advantages of such a route, if feasi ble, over others more remote from the axial lines of traffic between Europe and the Pa cific, and particularly between the valley of the Missouri and the western coast of North and South America, are deserving of consid eration. Whatever highway may be con structed across tho barrier dividing the two greatest maritime oceans of the world must bo for tho world's benefit, a trust for man kind to be removed from the chauce of domi nation by any single power, nor become a point of invitation for hostilities or a prize for warlike ambition. An engagement corn- Wining the construction, ownership and oper ation of such work by the government with an offensive and defensive alliance for its protection with the foreign state whose responsibilities and rights we would have, is, in my judgment, inconsistent with such dedi cation to universal and neutral use, and would, moreover, entail measures for its re alization. Beyond this scope our national policy or present means do not extend. THE 

LAPSE OP YEARS ha 3 abundantly confirmed the wisdom and foresight of these earlier administrations, winch, long before the conditions of maritime intercourse were changed and enlarged by the progress of the age, proclaimed the vital need of interoceanic traffic across the Ameri can isthmus and consecrated in advance to the common use of mankind by their positive declarations and through the formal obliga tion of treaties. Toward such realization, tbe efforts of my administration will be ap plied, ever bearing in mind the principles on which it must rest and which were declared in no uncertain tones by Mr. Cass, who, while secretary of state In 1856. announced that "What the United States wants in Central America next to the happi ness of the people, is the security and neu trality of interoceanic routes which lead through it." The construction of three transcontinental lines of railway, all in successful operation, wholly within our territory and uniting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, has been accom panied by results of a most interesting and impressive nature and has created new con ditions not only in the routes of commerce, but on political geograpy, which powerfully affects our relations toward and necessarily increases our interests in any transisthmian route which may be opened aud employed for the ends of peace and traffic, or in other contingencies, for uses inimical to both. Transportation is a faction in the cost of com modities scarcely second to that of their pro duction and weighs as heavily upon the con sumer. Our existence has already proven the great itnportauce of having the oom'pe tition between land carriers and water car riers fully developed, each acting as protec tion to the public against the tendencies of monopoly which is ineerent in the consolida tion of wealth and power in the hands of vast corporations. These suggestions may serve to emphasize what I have already said on the score of necessity of neutralization of any interoceanic transit, and this can only bo ac complished bj- making the use of the route open to all nations aud subject to the ambi tions and war-like necessities of none. Tne drawings and report of a recent survey of the Nicarauga canal route made by Chief Engineer Menacal will be communicated for your information. The claims of citizens of the United States for losses by the means of the late military operations of Chili in Peru and Bolivia are the subject of negotiation for a claim convention with Chili, providing for their submission to arbitration. Tbe Chinese Question. The harmony of our relations with China i s fully sustained in the application of the acts lately passed to execute the treaty of 1880. restrictive of the immigration of Chinese lab orers into the United States. Individual cases of hardship have occurred beyond the power of the executive to rem edy, and calling for judicial determination. The condition of the Chinese question in the Western states and territories is, despite this restrictive legislation, far from being satis factory. The recent outbreak in Wyoming Territory, where numbers of unoffending Chinamen, indisputably within tbe protection of the treaties and the law, were murdered by a mob, and the more recent threatened out break of the same character in Washington Territory are fresh in the minds of all. and there is apprehension lest the bitterness of feeling against the Mougoliau raoe on the Pacific slope may find vent in similar lawless demonstrations. All the Dowerof this government should be exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of these men, and the inflexible sternness of the law in bringing the wrong-doers to justice should be insisted upon. Every effort has been made by this government to prevent these violent outbreaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation if these out rages, and it is but just to say tnat they are traceable to the lawlessness of men, NOT CITIZENS of the United states, engaged in competition with Chinese laborers. Race prejudice is the chief factor in originating these disturb ances, and is. in a large part of our domain, jeopardizing our domestic peace and the good relationship we strive to maintain with China. The admitted right of a government to pre vent the influx of elements hostile to its internal peace and security may not be ques tioned, even where there is no treaty stipula tion on the subject. That the exclusion of Chinese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions prevail is strongly evinced in the Dominion of Can ada, where Chinese immigration is now regulated by laws more exclusive than our own. If existing laws are inadequate to compass the end in view, I shall be prepared to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measures, within the treaty limits, which the wisdom of congress may devise. THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF CONGO, The independent state of the Congo has been organized as a government, under the sovereignty of his majesty, the king of Bel gium, who assumes its chief magistracy, in iiis personal character only, without making the new state a dependency on Belgium. It is fortunate that a benighted region, j owing all it has of quickening j civilization to the beneficience and philanthropic spirit of this monarch, should tiave the advantage and security of its be nevolent supervision. The action taken by this government last year, in being the first to recognize the flag of the International as sociation of the Congo, has been followed by formal recognition of the new nationaliity. which succeeds to its sovereign powers. A conference of delegates of the principal com mercial nations was held at Berlin last winter to discuss methods whereby the Congo basin might be kept open to the world's trades. Delegates attened on behalf of the United States, on the understanding that their Dart should be merely deliberative, without im- I parting to the results any binding character ! so fur as the United States was concerned. ■ This reserve was due to the indisposition of j the government to share in any disposal by '■ an international congress of jurisdictional i questions in remote foreign territories. The results of the conference were embodied in a ' formal act of the nature of an international convention, which laid claim to certain obii- ' gatious purporting to be binding on the sig- I natories subject to ratification within one year. Notwithstanding the reservation un der which the delegates of the United States attended, their signatories were attached to the general act in the same manner as those of the plenipotentiaries of other governments, thus making the United States appear without reserve or qualification as signatory to a joint international engagement imposing on the signers the conservation of the territorial in- j , togrity of distant regions whero 'we have no j established interests or control. This govern ment does not, however, regard tlio reserva j tion of liberty of aotion in me premises us at all impaired, and holding that an engagement ; to share iti the obligation of enforced neutral . ity In the remote valley of the Congo would be I an alliance whose responsibility we are not in ; a position to assume, l abstain from asking the sanction of the senate to that general act. ■ The correspondence will be laid before you and the instructive and interesting report of tho agent sent by this government to the ■ Congo country, and his recommendations for : the establishment of commercial agencies on , the African coast are also submitted for your i consideration. The commission appointed by my pre decessor lust winter to visit the Central and South American countries and report on the methods of enlarging the commercial relations of the United States therewith has submitted reports which will bo laid before ' you. I No opportunity has been omitted to testify ! the friendliness of this government toward i Corea, whose entrance into the family of I treaty powers the United States was the first I to recognize. After elaborate correspondence, repeated i and earnest representations on our part Mr. ■ Santons was, after an alleged trial and con- I viction, eventually included in a general do ' cree of amnesty and pardoned by the Ecudor j ian executive and released, leaving the ques tion of his American citizenship denied by the Ecuadorian government, but insisted I upon by our own. FRENCH CLAIMS. The amount adjudged by the late French and American claims commission to be due from the United States to French claimants ou account of injuries suffered by them dur ing the war of secessiou having been appro priated by the last congress, has been duly paid the French government. The act of Feb. 25, 1805, provided for a preliminary search of the records of the French prize court for evidence bearing on the claims of American citizens against France for spolia tions committed prior to 1801. The duty has been performed, and the report of the agent will be, laid before you. The interpretation of our existing treaties of naturalization by Germany during the past year has attracted attention by reason of an apparent tendency on the part of the imperial government to extend the scope of the residential restrictions to which return ing naturalized citizens of Gorman origin are asserted to be liable under the laws of the empire. The temperate and just attitude taken by this government with regard to this class of questions will doubtless lead to a satisfactory understanding. The dispute of Germany and Spain relating to the denomina tion of THE CAROLINE ISLANDS has attracted the attention of the govern ment by reason of extensive interests of American citizens having grown up in these parts during the past thirty years, and be cause the question of ownership involves jurisdiction of matters affecting the status of our citizens under civil and criminal law. Whilst standing wholly aloof from the pro prietary issues raised between the powers, to hoth of which the United States is friendly, this government expects that nothing in the present contention shall unfavorably affect our citizens carrying on a peaceful commerce or there domiciled, and has so informed the governments of Spain and Ger many. Marked good will prevailed between the United States and Great Britain during the past year. The termination of the fishing clauses of the treaty of Washington, in pursuance of the joint resolution of March 3, 1883, must have resulted in the abrupt cassation oa the Ist of July of this year, in the midst of their ven tures, of the operations of citizens of the United States engaged in 

FISHING IN ' BRITISH-AMERICAN WATERS but for the diplomatic understanding reached with her majesty's government in June last, whereby assurance was obtained that no in terruption of those operations should take place during the current fishing season. In the interest at good neighborhood, of the com mercial intercourse of adjacent communities, the question of North American fisheries is one of much importance. Following 1 out the intimation given by me when the extensory arrangement above described was negotiated. 1 recommend that congress provide for the appointment of a commission, in which the governments of the United States and Great "Britain shall be respectively repre sented, charged with the consideration and settlement upon a just, equitable and honor able basis of the entire question of the fish ing rights of the two governments and their respective citizens off ' the coasts of the United States and British North America. THE FISHING INTERESTS being intimately related to other general questions dependent upon contiguity and in tercourse, consideration thereof in all their equities might also properly come within the view of such commission, and the fullest lat itude of expression on both siaes should be permitted. The correspondence in relation to the fishing rights will be submitted. The inadequacy of the exciting engagements for extradition between the United States and Great Britain has been long apparent. The tenth article of the treaty of 1842, one of the earliest compacts in this regard entered into by the United States, stipulated for sur render in respect of a limited number of of fenses. Other crimes no less inimical to the social welfare should be embraced and the procedure of extradition brought in har mony with the present international prac tices. Negotiations with her majesty's gov ernment for an enlarged treaty of extradition have been pending since 187<i, and I entertain strong hopes that a satisfactory result may be soon attained. The Arctic exploring steamer Alert, which was generously given by her majesty's gov ernment to aid in the relief of the Greely ex pedition, was.after the successful attainment of that humane purpose, returned to Great Britain, in pursuance of the authority con ferred by the act of March 3, 1885. The fron tier line between ' " 

ALASKA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA, as defined by the treaty of cession with Rus sia, follows the demarcation assigned in a prior treaty between Great Britain and Rus sia. Modern exploration discloses that this ancient boundary is impracticable as a ge ographical factor in the unsettled condition of the region. The question has lacked importance, but the discovery of mineral wealth in the territory the line is supposed to traverse admonishes that the time has come when an accurate knowledge of the boundary is needful to avert jurisdictions! complica tions. I recommend, therefore, that provision be made for preliminary recounoissance by officers of the United States to the end of ac quiring more precise information on the sub ject. I have invited her majesty's govern ment to consider with us the adoption of a more convenient line to be established by meridian observ* tions or by known geo graphic features without the necessity of an expensive survey of the whole. The late INSURRECTION MOVEMENTS IN HAYTI having been quelled, the government of that republic has made prompt provision for adju dicating the losses suffered by foreigners be cause of hostilities there, and the claims of certain citizens of the United States will be in this manner determined. A question arose with Hayti during the past year, by reason of the exceptional treatment of an American citizen, Mr. Van Bokkelen, a resident of Port au Prince, who on suit by oreditors residing in the Uni ted States was sentenced to imprisonment, and under the option of a Haytian statute was denied relief secured to a native Haytian. This government asserted its treaty right to equal treatment with the natives of Hayti in all suits at law. Our contention was denied by the Haytian government which, however, while still professing to maintain the ground against Mr. Van Bokkelen's right terminated the controversy by setting him ;at liberty without explanation. An international conference, to consider the means of arresting the spread of cholera and other epidemic diseases, was held at Rome in May last and adjourned to meet again on further notice. An expert delegate on behalf of the United States has attended the session and will submit a report. OUR 

RELATIONS WITH MEXICO continue to be most cordial, as befits those of neighbors, between whom the strongest ties of friendship and commercial intimacy exist, j as the nature and growinir consequences of our I institutions and geographical propenguity. The relocation of the boundary line between the United States and Mexico, eastward of the Rio Grande, under tbe convention of July 29. 1882, has been unavoidably delayed, but I apprehend no difficulty in securing a pro longation of the period for its accomplish ment. t The lately concluded commercial treaty with Mexico still awaits the stipulated legislation to carry its provisions Into effect, for which one year's additional time has been secured by a supplementary article signed in February last and since rectified on both sides. As this convention, so important to the commercial welfare of the two adjoining countries, has been constitutionally confirmed by the treaty making grounds to express the I hope that legislation needed to make it effec- I tive may not long be delayed. The large in j flux of capital and enterprise to Mexico from ' the United States continues to aid in the de i velopment of the resources, and in augment j in? the material well-being; of our sister re ' publics. Lines of railway penetrating to the ; heart and capital of the country bring the ! two people into mutual beneficial intercourse, ! and enlarged facilities of transit add to profit able commerce, create new markets and fur nish avenues to otherwise isolated communi ties. •-.-_, ■■-!•■ ■ I have already adverted to the suggested construction of a snip roadway across the narrow formation of the territory of Mexico and Tehuantepec, with the gradual recovery of Peru, from the effects of her late disas trous conflict with Chili, ana with the restora- I tion of ■ civil - authority /in ;, that distracted country. It Is hoped that pending war claims of ourWhizcns will be adjusted.: : In conform ity with notification given by the government of Peru, the existing treaties of commerce and extradition between the United States and that country will terminate March 31. 1886. .■ .■ . . . •• RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. Our good relationship with Kussiacontiuos. The officer of the navy detailed lor the pur pose is now on his way to Siberia bearing the testimonials voted by congress to those who generously succored the survivors of the un fortunate Jeannette expedition. . It is grati fying to revert to the : cordiality our inter course with Spain. The long pending claim of the owners of the ship Unmasonic for loss suffered through the admitted dereliction of the Spanish authorities on the Phil lipine islands has been adjusted by arbitration and an indemnity award. The principle of arbitration in such cases, to which the United States has long and con stantly adhered, thus receives a fresh and gratifying confirmation. Other questions with Spain have been disposed of or are un der diplomatic consideration with a view to just and honorable settlement. The opera tion of the commercial agreement with Spain of Jan. 2 and Feb. 13, 1884, has been found Inadequate to the commercial needs of the United States, and the Spanish Antilles and the terms of the agreement are subjected to conflicting interpretations in those islands. An international copyright conference was held at Berne in September on the invitation Of the Swiss government. The envoy of the United States attended as a delegate, but re frained from committing this government to the results, even by signing the recommend atory protocol adopted. The interesting and important subject of international copyright has been before you tor several years. Ac tion is certainly desirable to effect the object in view, and while there may be a question as to the relative advantage of treating it by legislation or by specific treaty, the matured views of the Berne conference cannot fail to aid your consideration of the subject. INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT. The termination of the commercial treaty of 1863 between the United States and Turkey has been sought by that government. While there is a question as to the sufficiency of the notice of termination given, yet, as the commercial rights of our citizens in Turkey come under the favored national guarantees of the prior treaty of IS3O, and as an equal treatment, is admitted by the porte, no inconvenience can result from the assent of this government to the revision of the Ottoman tariff, in which treaty the powers have been invited to join. Questions concerning our citizens in Turkey may be affected by the porte's non-acquies cence in the right of expatriation and by the imposition of religious tests as a condition of residence. In which this government cannot concur. The United States must hold, in their intercourse with every power, that the status of their citizens is to be respected and equal civil privileges accorded to them with out regard to creed, and affected by no con siderations save those growing out of domi ciliary return to the land of original allegi ance, or of unfulfilled personal obligations, which may survive under municipal laws after such voluntary return. . . VENEZCELIAN AWARDS. . "', The negotiation with Venezuela' raktfve to the rehearing of the awards of themfjftsd Com mission constituted under the treaty of .1866 was resumed in view of the recent ' acquies cence oi the Venezueliah envoy in the princi pal point advanced by this government, that the effects of the old treaty would only be set aside by the operation of a new convention. A result in substantial accord with the advis ory suggestions contained in the joint resolu tion of March 3, 1883, has been agreed upon and will shortly be submitted to the senate for ratification. Under Section 3659 of the revised statutes all funds held in trust by the United States, and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not otherwise required by treaty of the United States, bearing a. rate of interest not less than 5 per cent, per annum, there being now no procurable stocks paying so high a rate of interest, the letter of the statute is at present inapplicable, but its spirit is sub served by continuing to make investments of the nature In current " stocks bearing the highest interest now paid. The statute, however, makes no provision for such accretions, it being contrary to the general rule of this government totallow in terest on claims. I recommend the repeal of the provision in question and the disposition, under uniform rule, of the present accumu lations from investment of the trust fund. 

NATURALIZATION. The inadequacy of existing legislation touching citizenship and naturalization de mands your consideration. While recogniz ing the right of expatriation, no statutory provision exists providing means for re nouncing citizenship by an American, natural or naturalized, nor for terminating or vacat ing an improper acquisition of citizenship. Even a fraudulent decree of natural ization cannot now be cancelled. '. The privilege and franchise of American citizenship should bo granted with care and extended to those who intend in good faith to assume its duties and responsibilities when attaining its privileges and benefits. It should ,be withheld from those who merely go through the forms of naturalization with the intent of escaping the duties of their original alle giance, without taking upon themselves those of their new status, or who may acquire the rights of American citizenship for no other than a hostile purpose towards their original governments. These evils have had many flagrant illustrations. Negotiations have been instituted at Madrid for a full treat}' not open to these objections, and in the line of the general policy touching the neighborly intercourse of proximate com munities, to which I elsewhere advert, and aiming moreover at the removal of existing burdens and annoying restrictions, and. al though a satisfactory term nation is prom ised, I am compelled to delay a definite an nouncement. ■ 1 regard with favor the suggestion put forth by one of my predecessors, that pro vision may be made for a central bureau of record of the decrees of naturalization granted by the various courts throughout the United States, now invested with that power. The rights which 1 spring from domicile -in the United States, especially when coupled with a declaration of intention to become a citizen, are worthy o f definition by statute. The stranger coming here with intent to remain, establishing his residence in our midst, con tributing to the general welfare, and by his voluntary act declaring his purpose to as sume the responsibilities of citizenship thereby gains inchoate status, which legisla tion may properly define. Tho laws of cer tain states aud territories admit a domiciled alien to the local franchise, conferring on him the rights of citizenship to a degree which places him in the anatna lous position of being a citizen of a state, and yet not of the United States, within the pur view of federal and international law. It is Important within the scope of national legis lation to define this right of alien domicile as distinguished from federal naturalization. THE COMMERCIAL RELATIONS of the United States with its immediate neighbors, and with important areas of traffic near our shores, suggest especially liberal in tercourse between them and us, following the treaty of 1883 with Mexico, which . rested on the basis of a reciprocal ■ exemp tion from customs duties. Other similar treaties were initiated by my predecessor. Recognizing the need of less obstructed- traffic with Cuba and Porto Rico, and not by the desire of Spain to succor languishing interests in the Antilles, steps were taken to attain these ends by a treaty of commerce. A similar treaty was afterward signed by the Dominican republic. Subse quently overtures were made by her Britanic majesty's government for a like mutual ex tension of commercial intercourse with the British West India and South American de pendencies, but without result. On taking office I withdrew for re-examination the treaties signed with Spain and Santo Domingo, then pending before the senate. The result has been to satisfy me of the Inexpediency of entering into engagements of this character not . covering tho entire tariff. These treaties contemplated the sur render, by the United States, of large rev enues for inadeauate considerations. Upon sugar alone duties were surrendered to an amount far exceeding all the advantages offered in exchange. Even were it intended to relieve our consumers, it was evident that, so long as the exemption but partially cov ered our importation, such relief would be illusory. To relinquish a revenue so essen tial seemed highly improvident at a time when new and large drains upon the treasury were contemplated. Moreover, embarrassing questions would have arisen under the favored nation clauses of treaties with other nations. As further objection it is evident that tariff regulation by treaty diminished that inde pendent control over its own revenues which is essential for the safety and welfare of any government. The emergency calling for an increase of taxation may at any - time arise, and no engagement with a foreign power should exist to hamper the action of the gov ernment. By the 14th section of the shipping act, approved June 26, 1884, certain reduc tions and contingent exemptions from ton nage dues -were made, as to vessels entering ports of the United States from any foreign port in North and Central America, the West India islands, the Bahamas and Bermudas, Mexico and the isthmus as far as Aspinwall and Panama. The governments of Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Portugal and Sweden and Norway have asserted under the favored na tion clause in other treaties with the United States, a claim to like treatment in respect to vessels coming to the United States from their home ports. This government, how ever, holds that the privileges granted by the act are purely geographical, enuring te any vessel of any foreign power that may choose to - ENGAGE TS TRAFFIC • " : "-> between this country and any part within the defined zone, and no warrant exists under the inost-favorel-nation clau-e for tho extension of the privileges In question to vessels sailing to this country from ports outside the limita tion of tho act. Undoubtedly the relations of coimnerco with our near neighbors whose ter ritories form so large a frontier lino, difficult to be guarded, aud who find in our country, I nnd equally offer to us, national markets, de- ! mnud special and considerate- treatment. It rests with congress to consider what action may increase facilities of intercourse which | coutinirencj makes natural and desirable. 1 1 earnestly urge that congress rcoist the ap propriations for the maintenance of the diplomatic and consular service ou a footing commensurate with the importance of our national Interests at every post where a representative Is necessary. The salary should bo so graded as to permit to live with comfort. With tho assignment of adequate salaries, the so-called national extra official fees which our officers abroad are now per mitted to treat as PHRSOIfAL PERQUISITES should be done away with. Every act re quiring the certifljation aud seal of the offi cers should be taxable by a set schedule of rates, and the fee therefor returned to the treasury. By restoring these revenues to the public use, the consular service would be self-supporting, even with a liberal increase of the present low salaries in further preven tion of abuses. A system of consular in spection should be instituted. The appoint ment of a limited number of secretaries of legation at large to be as signed to duty whenever necessary and in particular for tempoiary service- at mis sions, which for any cause may be without a head, should also be authorized. I favor also authorization for the detail of officers of the regular service as military or naval attaches at legations. Some foreign governments do not recognize the union of consular with di plomatic function. Italy and Venezuela will only receive the appointee in one of his two capacities, but this does not prevent the re quirement of a bond and submission to the responsibilities of our officer, whose duties he cannot discharge. The separated titles of consular general should be abandoned. I deem it expedient that a well-devised measure for the reorganization of the extra 

TERRITORIAL COURTS in Oriental countries should replace the present system which labors under the dis advantage of combining judicial and execu tive functions in the same office. In several Oriental countries generous offers have been made of premises for housing the legations of the United States. A grant of land for that purpose was made some years since by Japan, and has been referred to in the annuaj messages of predecessors. The Siam gov eminent has made a gift to the United- States of commodious quarters in Bangkok. In Corea the late minister was permitted to purchase a building from the government for legation use. In China the premises rented for the legation are favored as to local charges. At Tangier the house occupied by our representative has been for many years the property of this government, having been given for that pur pose in 1823 by the sultan of Morocco. I ap prove the suggestion heretofore inado that in view of the conditions of life and administra tion in the Eastern countries the legation buildings in China, Japan, Corea, Siam and perhaps Persia, should be owned and furnished by the government with a view to permanency and security. To this end, I recommend that authority be given to accept the gifts adverted to in Japan and Siam. and to purchase in the other coun tries named, with provision for furniture and repairs. A considerable saving in rentals would result. THE 

WORLD'S INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITION held at New Orleans last winter, with the as sistance of the federal government, attracted a large number of foreign exhibits and proved of great value in spreading among the con course of visitors from Mexico and Central and South America a wider knowledge of the various manufactures and productions of this country, and their availability in exchange for the productions of those regions. Past congresses have had under consider ation the advisability of abolishing the dis crimination made by the tariff iaws in favor of the works of American artists. The odium of the policy which subjects to a high rate of duty the paintings of foreign artists, and exempts the .production of American artists residing abroad and who receive gratu itously advantage and instruction is invested upon our citizens engaged in art culture in Europe and have caused them with unanim ity to favor the abolition of such an ungra cious distintion and In their interest, and, for other obvious reasons I strongly recommend it. THE FINANCES. A Surplus of Nearly $25,000,000 for the Fiscal Year. The report of the seeietary of the treasury fully exhibits the condition of the public finances and of the several branches of gov erument connected with his department. The suggestions of the secretary relating to prac tical operations of this important department and iiis recommendations in the direction of simplification and economy, particularly of the work of collecting custom duties, are es pecially urged upon the attention of con gress. The ordinary receipts f ram all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1885, were $322,690,706.38. Of this sum $181,471,939.31 was received from customs and §112, -498,725.54 from internal revenue. The total receipts as given above were $-4,829,163.54 less than those for the year end ing June 30, 1884. This diminution embraces a falling off of $13,595,550.42 iv the receipts from customs, and $»,687,346.07 in the re ceipts from internal revenue. The total or dinary expenditures of tae goveantnent for the fiscal year were $260,226,935, leaving a surplus in the treasury at the close of tho year of $63,463,771.27. This is $40,929,854.32 less than THE SURPLUS REPORTED at the close of the previous year. The ex pend.tures are classified as follows: For civil exoenses, $23,826,942.11; lor foreign inter course, 85,439,609.11; for Indians, $6,552, -494.63; for pensions, $56,102,267.49; for the military, including river and harbor improve ments and arsenals, $42.(570,578.47; for the navy, including vessels, machinery and im provements of navy yards, $16,021,079.69; for the interest in the public departments. $51,386,256.47; for the District of Columbia, 53,499,650.95; for miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, lighthouses and collecting the revenue, $54,738,054.31. The amount paid on the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 30. 1885, was 545.993, -235.43, and there has been paid since that day and up to Nov. 1, 1885, the sum af 83(59, -828, leaving the amount of the debt at the last named date $1,514,475,860.47. There was, however, at that time in the treasury appli cable to the general purposes of the govern ment, the sum of 5(56,818,292.38. THE TOTAL RECEIPTS for the current fiscal year, ending June 30. 1886, ascertained to Oct. 1, 1885, and esti mated for the remainder of the year, are $315,000,000; the expenditures ascertained and estimated for the same is $245,000,000, leaving a surplus at the close of the year estimated at $90,000,000. The value of im ports from the United States to foreign coun tries during the last fiscal year was as follows: Domestic merchandise, 8726, -682,946; foreign merchandise, $15,506,809; gold, $8,477,892; silver. $33,753,633; total, $784,421,280. Some of the principal exports, with their values and the percentage they respectively bear to the total exporta tion, are given as follows: Per- Articles.

The fact that our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of the government justifies a reduction in the amount EXACTED FROM THE PEOPLE for its support. Our government is but the means established by the will of a free peo ple, by which certain principles are applied, which they have adopted for their benefit and protection, and it is never better administered and its true spirit never better observed than when the people's taxation for its support is scrupulously limited to the actual necessity of expenditure, and distributed according to a just and equitable plan. The proposition i with which we have to deal is the ! reduction of the revenue received by tho \ government and Indirectly paid by the people from custom duties. The question of free j trado is not involved, nor is there now any occasion for the general discussion of the wisdom or expediency of a protective system. Justice und fairness dictate that any modifi cation of our present laws relating to revenue, tlu; industries and interests which have been encouraged by such laws, and in which our citizens havo large investments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subject in such manner as to protect the interests of Ameri can labor.which Is the capital of our working men. Its stability and proper remuneration furnish the most justifiable pretext for a pro tective policy within these limitations. A certain reduction should be made on our cus toms revenue. The amount of such reduction having been determined, the inquiry follows where can it best be remitted and what arti cles can best be released from duty in the in terest of our citizens. I think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived from a tax upon the imported necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen the cost of living in every family of the iand, and release to the people in every humble home a larger meas ure of the rewards of frugal industry. National Banks. During the year ended Xov. 1, 1885, 145 national banks were organized with an aggre gate capital of $16,938,000, and circulating notes have boen issued to them amounting to $4,274,910. The whole number of these banks in existence on the day above mentioned was 2.727. The very limited amount of circula ting notes is iuuil by our national banks com pared with the amount the law permits them to issue upon a deposit of bonds for their redemption indicates that the volume of our circulation medium may be largely increased through his instrumentality. Nothing more important thau the present condition of our currency and coinage can claim your attention. Since February, IS7B, the government has, under the compulsory provisions of law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at the rate of more than 2.000,00) of dollars every month. By this process up to the present date 215, -759,431 silver dollars have been coined. A reasonable appreciation of a delegation of power to the general government would limit its exercise without express restrictive words to the people's needs and the requirements of the public welfare. Upon this theory the authority to "coin money," as given to congress by the constitution, if it permits the purchase Dy the government of bullion for coinage in any event, does not justify such purchase and coinage to an extent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circulating medium. The desire to utilize the silver pro duct of the country should not lead to a mis use or the perversion of this power. The necessity for such an addition to THE 

SILVER CURREXCV of the nation as is compelled by the silver coinage act, is negatived by the fact that up to the present time only about $40,000,000 of silver so coined have actually found their way intocirculation, leaving more than $165,000,000 in possession of the government, the custody of which has entailed a considerable expense for construction of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver certifi cates amounting to about $93,000,000. Every month $2,000,000 of gold in the public treas ury are paid out for $2,000,000 or more of sil ver, to be added to the idle mass already accumulated. If continued long enough this operation will result In the substitution of silver for all the gold the government owns applicable to its general purposes. It will not do to rely upon the customs receipts of the government to make good this drain of gold, because the silver coined having been made legal tender for all debts and dues, public and private, at times during the last six months 58 per cent, of the re ceipts for duties have been in silver or silver certificates, while the aver age withiu that period has been 20 per cent. The portion of silver and its certificates re ceived by the government will probably in crease as time goes on, for the reason that the nearer the period approaches when it will be obliged to offer silver in payment of its obligations, the greater inducement there will be to hoard gold against depreciation on the sum of silver, and for THE 

PURPOSE OP SPECULATING. This hoarding of gold has already begun. When the time conies that gold has been withdrawn from circulation, then it will be apparent that there is a difference between the real value of the silver dollars and a dol lar in gold, and the two coins will part com pany. Gold is still the standard of value, and is necessary in our dealings with other countries. It will be at a premium over silver. The banks whioh have substi tuted prold for the deposits of their cus tomers may pay them with silver bought with such gold, thus netting a handsome profit. Rich speculators will sell their hoarded gold to their neighbors who need it to liquidate their foreign debts, at ruinous premiums over silver, and the laboring men and women of the land, most defenseless of all, will find that the dollar received for the wages of their toil has sadly shrunk in its purchasing power. It may be said that the latter result will be but temporary and that ultimately the price of labor will be adjusted to the change, but even if this takes place the wage worker can not possibly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the price he is compelled to pay for his living will not only be measured in a coin heavily depreciated and fluctuating and un certain in its value, but this uncertainty in the value of the purchasing medium will be made the pretext for an advance in prices be yond that justified by actual depreciation. The words uttered in 1834 by DANIEL WEBSTER in the senate of the United States are true to-day. "The very man of all others who has the deepest interest in a sound currency and who suffers most oy mischievous legisla tion in money matters is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil." The most distinguished advocate of bi-metalism, dis cussing our silver coinage, has lately written : "No American citizen had as yet felt the sensation of cheapness, either on receiving or expending the silver act dollars." And those who live by labor or legitimate trade never will feel that sensation of cheap ness. However plenty silver dollars may be come they will not be distributed as gifts among the people, and if the laboring man should receive four depreciated dollars where he now receives but two he will pay in the depreciated coin more than double the price he now pays tor all the necessaries and com forts of life. Those who do not fear any dis astrous consequences arising from the con tinued compulsory coinage of silver as now directed by law, and who suppose that the ad dition to the currency of the country, in tended as a result, will be a public benefit are reminded that history demonstrates that the point is easily reached in the attempt to float at the same time two sorts of money of dif ferent excellence when the better will cease to be in circulation. THE HOARDING OP GOLD, which has already taken place, indicates that we shall not escape the usual experience in such cases. So if this silver coinage be con tinued we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field of oirculatiou to silver alone. This, of course, must produce a severe contraction ot our circulating medium instead of adding to it. It will be disputed that any attempt on the part of the government to cause the circula tion of silver dollars worth 80 cents side by side with gold dollars worth 100 cents, even with the limit that legislation does not run counter of laws of trade, to be successful must be seconded by the confidence of the people that both coins may re tain their same purchasing power and be interchangeable at will. A special effort has been made by the secre tary to increase the amount of our silver coin in circulation, but the fact that a large share of the limited amount thus put out has soon returned to the public treasury in pay ment ot duties, leads to the belief that the people do not now desire to keep it in hand, and this with the evident disposition to hoard gold, gives rise to the suspicion that there already exits a lack of confidence among the people touching ou r financial practices. There Is certainly not enough silver now in circulation to cause uneasiness.and the whole amount coined and now on hand might after a time be absorbed by the people witbont ap prehension, but it is the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the laud which causes fear and uncertainty. What has been thus far submitted upon this subject relates al most entirely to considerations of a home na ture unconnected with the bearing which the policies of other nations have upon the ques tion, but it is perfectly apparent that a time of action IN REGARD TO OUR CTRRENCr cannot wisely be settled upon, or persisted in, without considering the attitude of the subject of other countries with whom we maintain Intercourse through commercial trade and travel. An acknowledgement of this fact is found in the act by virtue of which our silver is compulsorily coiued. It provides that "The president shall invite the governments of the countries comprising the Latin union so called, and such other emperor's nations as he may deem advisable,to join the United States in a conference to adopt a common ratio be tween gold and silver for the purpose of es tablishing internationally the use of di metallic money and securing fixity of the relative value between those metals. This conference absolutely failed, and a sim ilar fate has awaited all subsequent efforts in the same direction, and still we continue OUR 

COINAGE OF SILVER at a ratio different from that of any other nation. The most vital part of the silver coinage act remains inoperative and unex ecuted, and without an ally or friend we battle upon the silver field in an illogical and losing contest. To give full effect to the de 9 sign of congress on this subject I have made careful and euruest endeavor since the ad journment of the last contfre>*B. To this end I 'I ■■••._, iti'd a gentleman well instructed ia fiscal science to proceed to the fiuancial cen ters of Europe and in conjunction with our ministers to England, France and Germany to obtain a full knowledge of the attitude and intent of these governments in respect to the establishment of such an International ratio as would procure free coinage of both inetula at the mintH of those countries and our own. By my direction our consul general at Paris has given close attention to the pro ceedings of the congress of the Latin Union in order to indicate our interest in it« object,. and report its action. It may be said in brief, as the result of these efforts, that the attitude of the leading powers remains substantially unchanged since the monetary conference of I**l, nor Is to be questioned that the views of these governments are for instance sup ported by the weight of publio opinion. The views thus taken have, there fore, only more fully demonstrated the use leseness of further attempts at present to arrive at any argument on the subject witia other nations. In the meantime WE ARE 

ACCUMULATING SILVER COIS, based upon our own peculiar ratio, to such an extent and assuming so heavy a burden to be provided for in any international negotia tions, as will render us an undesirable party to any future monetary conference of na tions. It is a significant fact that four of the five countries composing the Latin union men tioned in our coinage act, embarrassed with their silver currency, have just completed an agreement among themselves that no more silver shall be coined by their respective gov ernments, and that such as has been already coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the country of its coinage. The resort to this expedient by these countries may well arrest the attention of those who supposed that we can succeed without shock or injury in the attempt to circulate upon its merits all the silver we may coin under the provisions of our silver coinage act. The condition in which our treasury may be placed by a persistence in our present course is A 

MATTER OF CONCERN 1 to every patriotic citizen who does not desire his government to pay in silver such of its obligations as should be paid in gold. Nor should our condition be such as to oblige us, in a prudent management of our affairs, to discontinue the calling in and payment of in terest-bearing obligations which we have the right now to discharge and thus avoid the payment of further interest thereon. The 60-called debtor class, for whoso benefit the continued compulsory coinage of silver is insisted upon,are not dis honest, because they are in debt and they should not be suspected of a desire to jeop ardize the financial safety of the country in order that they may cancel their present debts by paying the same in depreciated dol lars, nor should it be forgotten that it is not the rich nor the money-lender alone that must submit to such readjustment, forced by the government and their debtors. The pittance of THE 

WIDOW AND THE ORPHAN and the incomes of helpless beneficiaries of all kinds would be disastrously reduced. The depositors in savings banks and in other institutions which held in trust the savings of the poor, when their little accumulations are scaled down to meet the new order of things, would in th ir distress painfully real ize the delusion of the promise made to them, that plentiful money would improve their condition. We have now on hand all the sil ver dollars necessary to supply the present needs of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish to see them in circula tion, and if their coinage is suspended they can be readily obtained by all who desire them. If the need of more is at any time ap parent their coinage may be renewed. That disaster has not already overtaken us furnishes no proof that danger does not wait upon a continuation of the present silver coinage. We have been saved by THE
