THE PRESI1ENTS' MESSAGE. NEWS FROM WALTER. LAST ANNUAL MESSAGE. SOUTHWARD, HO! Opportunity Is Knocking Now with the Hind of Fate at Our Door, Investment of Northern and West ern Capital Dependent Upon Evidenced Public Senti ment and Legislation. The last tormal message that Presi dent Roosevelt wilt send to Congress was. read before both, branches of that body yesterday, and covered 44 print ed pages; the average reader, therefore, will hardly peruse it throughout, con sequently the Aruos publishes for our readers a condensed but salient syn opsis of the voluminous document. The message is vigorous, eompre- hensive and positive, and will' cause the country at large, and the politicians purely ot both parties, who batten on the party fealty of the people,to "sit up and take notice." - It is fortunate for North Carolina that with the dawning of the new yer, that holds so much ot promise of re turning confidence and prosperity, the Legislature convenes in Raleigh, through which the business world, and especially large invested capital and large capital seeking safe and sane investment, may be tar nishad expression of the equable sentiment of the people of this State and assurance that the day of the dem agogue rampant is passed, whose brief, blatant occupancy of official place wrought such devastation in the estop pel of development and the shrinkage of industrial values.

Opportunity is now knocking with the. hand of fate at our door. Let us open to that knock and welcome what it portends. The Baltimore Manufacturers' Ree ord has been interviewing, broadcast, reputable Northern and Western finan ciai magnates and in last week's issup publishes many expressions largely directed toward the South, which the Record is always assiduously laboring to develop, and of the many views published, we are paiticularly struck with the truth, wisdom and opportune ness of the following expression from Messrs. Watson & Alpers, brokers, of New York: "There can be no question that the South piesents many attractive possi bilities for the investment of Northern capital, but whether this capital will move in that direction depends, it seems to us, upon popular sentiment and the attitude of the legislative pow ers. Not even at the West was there such a display of animosity toward the railroads as was shown in many of the Southern States during the crusade ol last winter. This seemed to be all the more strange to the people of the North, because up to that time our Southern fiienls had apparently been holding out tlia hands of welcome to investors fr im the North and, in fact, from all pa.ts of the world. If South ern Legislatures show a different spirit than that which seemed to animate them in the last year or so, and confi dence can be felt that fair and honest returns will be allowed upon all iorms of investment, there is little doubt that your great section of the country will bo able to command in timo all the money needed to double-track and otherwise improve its railroads, to in. crease its cotton manufacturing indus try and to develop its great mineral resources that bare yet, it may be said, "been merely scratched on the surface. Sectional and political prejudices are rapidly dying ont, and if security can be assured to investments, we look to see much surplus Northern funds free ly put at your service for expansion and improvement."

"A good many people imagine that it is ooming some time in the distant future (they can't tell just when,) and that in some un known way they can somehow escape giving up any money to boy presents. Now, you. may as well face the music. Christmas is coming a little less than a month from now, and the days will spin around before yon know it. You bnow yon want to give them all presents they will appreciate and enjoy the wife, the children, daughter and son, father, mother and your sweetheart, if you are in the true lovers' class. "Buy your presents now. You have more time to mane your selections. you can shop with comfort; you get first choice of the fine stocks ot Christ mas goods; sney will not cost you a cent more. By doing your shopping early you give the storekeeper and the clerk a chance; you distribute bus! ness over a longer period; you aceom modate them' and they accomodate you. It is of mutual benefit to buyer and seller. "Just at this time early Christmas buying would help to revive business and should be a substantial aid in the restoration of prosperity. "Join the prosperity promoters the wise men and the considerate men and bay your Christmas presents now. And" you will rejoice and be exceeding' ly glad when you .find you will not have to fight your way, through the surging throngs that crowd the streets and . stores just before-the holidays fighting for goods, and at last taking not what pleases them, but what they can get.

From the number of new tobacco barns in the course of construction in this section, one might infer that the farmers are preparing lo increase their aereage in tobacco next year. They evidently think it cheaper,and decided ly mere neighborly to give the trusts a cham tobacco than to give the specu lators a bale of cotton, and we are of the same opinion. But the salvation of the farmer will never be complete until he increases acreage in hog and hominy.

C, Dec. 9. In I oth Houses of Congress yesterday interest centered in the President's message. Senator Aldrich and Representative Payne, for the Senate and House com mittees, appointed to notify the Presi dent that the two bodies were in ses sion, informed their respective Houses that they had performed this duty. Secretary Latta followed closely upon their heels and the reading ofthe mes sage began in the Senate at 12:15 and in the House a few initiates after. The galleries of both Houses were well fitt ed and almost all the seats Jot Senatois and Bepresentativeswere'occupied. All of them were supplied with printed copies of the message, which proved to be a document of forty-four printed pages with an elaborate appen dix, showing the vorkgol the forestry bureau. Members immediately busied themselves with the printed copies be fore them. In the course of his message, the President makes clear the need tmr sotne form ot currency reform; de Clares that the Federal government alone can deal properly with corpora tions and suggests that some agency of the National government be given supervision and full control over them He also recommends that jthe railways be removed entirely from the control ot the anti trust law and placed under the interstate commerce commission: He urges that swindling stock specu lations be halted. Mr. Roosevelt also recommends that the telephone and telegraph companies doing an inter state business be placed under the in terstate commerce law. He ' reiterates his recommendation for recompense for injury to employes ef the govern ment; old age pensions and the enact ment of a model labor law for the Dis trict of Columbia. He favors and again recommends . a progressive in heritance tax; industrial education, eight-hour day for Federal employes. He favors the middle ground in court decisions in industrial disputes, with equitable decisions toward each party to the controversy. The power of injunction, declares Mr. Roosevelt, is a great equitable remedy and on no account should it be destroyed. But safeguards should be enacted against its abuse. Based upon tbe experience of China, ke makes a powerful plea for the pre servation of our forests. He urges the admission of Arizona and New Mexico to statehood as two states, and favors oitirenship for the Porto Ricans. Mi, Roosevelt stands by his guns in the matter of keeping a medical officer in command of the hospital ships. MR.
