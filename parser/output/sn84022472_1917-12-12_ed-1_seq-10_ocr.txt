Ouiterres, It Is said, had no trouble In .winning the people over to his cause, t n ivi r. ooover s MR. HERBERT HOOVER, National Food Admin istrator, had the right idea when he recently said in an official statement:, "Those who. wish brewing entirely suppressed should bear in mind that if such a course were pursued THE COUNTRY WOtJLD BE PLACED UPON' A WHISKEY BASIS entirely." That is the crux of the True Temperance question Which Prohibitionists in their over-zealousness fail to see. Mr. Hoover's statement was made in connection with his recommendation that, as a food conservation measure, the alcoholic content of beer be reduced to 23A per cent In the brewing of beer, alcohol is riot sought by the brewer, but is an incident to the process' through natural fermentation. The new 2 3A per cent. American beers will be similar . to those so popular in Norway, Denmark and Sweden, where, on account of their low percentage of alcohol, they are classed among the True Temperance drinks, and, to en courage their consumption, ARE MADE TAX FREE. , The Uitft&d States Brewers' 4&soci&tion.
