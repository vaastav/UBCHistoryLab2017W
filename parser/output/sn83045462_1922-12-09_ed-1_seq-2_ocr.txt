u. mm NAVAL RIVALRYKFEARED Failure to Ratify Washington Treaties May Result in Building Contest. TORIES SUSPECT AMERICA Figures Quoted in Effort to Show United States Plans Sea Supremacy. BY HAL O'FLAIIERTY. By Cable to The Star and Chicago Daily News. Copyright, 1922. LONDON, December 9.?Such overpowering Importance is attached by the conservative elements to the necessity of bringing the British navy up to and beyond the American naval j strength that another naval building contest between two great nations may occur in event the Washington treaty snouia remain u:iratuieu uy an the powers concerned. Statements emanating: from Washington and from American representatives at Lausanne furnish the basis for belief by British minds that the United States is already well advanced on plans for naval supremacy. This belief has been strengthened by figures brought out during a debate in the house of lords and published widely as showing a rapid decline in Great Britain's naval strength as compared with that of the United States. Anxiety In England. These figures have created unusual anxiety in this country, and if the Washington treaty remains in Its present inoperative state violent British suspicions may be produced that may render fruitless all past efforts at disarmament. Loyal Britons who were taught at their grandfathers' knees that "Britain rules the waves'* have been startled beyond measure by cleverly arranged figures which show possibilities of an American fleet far superior to the British. As a matter of fact, the same figures could be taken in the United States to prove the superiority of the British navy. As the situation stands, however, the British cabinet has only to sanction plans to bring the British naval strength up to the naval ratio agreed on in Washington. Under the terms of the treaty it is provided that Great Britain may lay down two battleships this year for completion in 1925. The estimates for these ships were approved by the last parliament, but the Lloyd George nviriiiuioiik |iuiipuaru uie uuiiaiflf to allow a committee to investigate 1 alternative proposals. The resigna- j tfbn of the coalition government left 1 settlement of the question to the Bonar law ministry, which has com- i pleted plans for the new vessels, and undoubtedly Intends to sanction their construction. Object to Scrapping. "What aroused the Ire of the eonaervatives is the haste displayed by the coalition government in destroy- ( ing ships without waiting ratification ] of the treaty, especially since the United States has destroyed only ob- \ solete ships. They complain that i Lloyd George threw away Britain's J reserve strength without hastening < measures for the development of ; dreadnaughts of the post-Jutland , type. The tories claim that If the treaty r remains unratified the relative j strength of the three great powers j will be: United States, forty-one c capital ships: Great Britain, twentythree; Japan, twenty-three. Even <5 if the treaty is ratified, they say, the t United States still will lead with a live post-Jutland ships, while Britain will have only one partly up-to-date.

Great Britain's naval policy, as influ- p enced by her ratification of the Washington agreement, the Saturday Review, under the caption of "The Washington Fiasco." says that France and Italy t: have no; yet ratified the agreement, and ? there seems good reason for thinking | p that France does not intend to ratify it I v and that this course will most probably b be followed by Italy. p "If they refuse ratification,'- the paper a continues, "the treaty will fail, and the ti program, of course, will become inoper- j atlve. This Is tantamount to saying that the scrapping of ships and the suspension of construction should not be undertaken. F "The plain business of the interested g powers was to do nothing until the treaty was ratified by all. What " is now to be done in view of the almost certain failure of the naval treaty to q protect the interests of Britain and the h empire, which depend for very existence c, on adequate sea power? What has been K done cannot, we suppose, be undone, e but there should be no more scrapping ? of ships and the building of two new " capital ships of 35.000 tons each should ? proceed forthwith."

He refused to let the Russians sil in on discussions of questions purelj concerning the allies and Turkey, bul the Russian experts are at liberty tc talk with the allied experts. Declarations Are Contradictory. Commissar Tchltcherin's declarations are contradictory. Here is ar example: "Regarding generally the Turkish proposals as to the disarmament ol the straits, the Russian delegation approves. but as to practical propositions Russia reserves final declslor until after a detailed examination by a commission or subcommission. or by a commission of experts. We demand the right to ask for explanations under reserve as to the maintenance ol the Russian point of view as to the closing of the straits to warships under Turkish sovereignty and the right to fortify to conserve peace in the Black sea." This is equivalent to saying that the Russians accept without accepting. They must soon see that the Turks have left them and that they must find a way of getting in line.

The colonel's idea was that the citizens' associations might come to the District building at stated intervals for serious-minded and constructive discussion of the needs of their respective sections, so that the Commissioners might know what they desire and the citizens at the same time become familiar with what the Commissioners have in mind. In opening the hearing Col. Keller referred to the sums of money for wnicn me ^uiuiuibsiuiioib nave aancu to pave various parts of Connecticut avenue next year, and then outlined what he and hla colleagues have In mind for the treatment of that part of the avenue which the Capital Traction Company Is required to maintain. Statement fey Keller. On this subject he said: "As to this portion of the avenue we wish to explain that we regard the existing track construction of the Capital Traction Company as merely temporary. It ought eventually and probably soon, to be replaced by a more permanent type, better adapted to city conditions. "As all of you know, however, no definite conclusion has been reached by thoughtful people who really understand the Interests of the public in the matter as to whether the permanent construction shall be of underground type or whether the public will not in reality be better served by the overhead trolley type so designed as to carry the minimum number of overhead wires, the feeder cable being placed underground. We are proposing in the near future to present to the public a statement, showing Just what the cost will be for each type of construction on Connecticut avenue and what the effect will be on the pocket of the car rider. It may be said that the underground type costs perhaps three times as much as the other, and that If this more expensive type is chosen the car rider will for all future times be obliged to pay as part of his carfare a fair return on a considerable sum for something that adds nothing to the convenience or to the quality of the service." * Would Save Expenses. Col. Keller stated that until it is decided what should be done with the car tracks it is in the public interest to avoid Expenditures for paving the car tracka Continuing, the colonel said: "We are all anxious to see car fares reduced and this can be done only when the income of the companies thus combined exceeds a just return on their legitimate investment. We cannot control the number of car riders, who, by the way, are decreasing. so that the only way the net : return caa be increased is by keeping down expenses."

Col. Keller said: "These curbs were installed as a confessedly temporary expedient to separate the roadway from the track space, because It Was not desired to force the traction company to improve this portion of the line until we were sure that improvement' would be permanent and its cost in carfare to the public therefore pustiflable. Whenever these conditions 1 are settled, as previously stated, the : railroad right of way will be im- i proved and properly surfaced and the I curbs removed." Opposes Laying Others.

CLEMENCEAU BEGS U.S. 10 RECONSIDER New World Parley and Revised League Covenant Urged. Georges CTemenceati's address in Coninental Memorial Hall yesterday afterloon was a diplomatically worded Inflation to the United States to call the treat powers to a new world conference vhere a new league of nations, acceptible to this government and yet capable >f Insuring permanent peace, might be ramed. This was the view taken today >y persons here who studied the French var premier's words. M." Clemenceau left no doubt that Europe cannot hope to find Its way out >f Its present international dilemma vithout at least the moral help of the United States, and he seized upon Presdent Harding's reference to the four>ower pact as an indication of the American government's willingness to ipen discussions on an International igreement to which the United States vould be a party. President's Words Quoted. "I was very greatly comforted," the French "Tiger" said, "when I read .his morning in the message of your President, President Harding, the 'ollowing lines. They are not very ong. but they are very suggestive: "'The four-power pact, which abolshes every probability of war in the Pacific, has brought new confidence n a maintained peace. We have had expressed the hostility of the American people to a super-government or o any commitment where either a rouncil or an assembly of leagued lowers may chart our course.' "So you see that those w ho are sup-1 >osed to disagree really agree at the rery bottom of the feeling and reasoning powers. That Is what I ask. ind I hope this is something like an iverture; that some light will be loming. And I will be very glad if it omes from America. I hope that Itplomacy will have something to say ibout it and talks may be engaged In, vhich I am sure can bring nothing >ut good for all of us." Reference to Geneva. Swinging Immediately around to a liscussion of the present league of lations, M. Clcmcnceau suggested hat It had already done much for Austria and Siberia, and did it "in a. ather good way." He diplomatically emarked that the league was always here ready to accept the United j Slates as a member?"maybe with j lome reservations to keep yourself i 'ree of Its dangers." He observed hat It was altogether probable that his government already has an obi^rv^r "watphin?- fnr vnii " The ever-growing need for the reurn of America's moral assistance n European affairs, Clemenceau de lared. might readily be seen in conlltlons abroad today. The Turk, he leclared. has assumed the role of a llctator; Germany insolently refuses o obey the provisions of the treaty >f Versailles and Russia is storing up ter gold as ammunition for purposes hat need no explanation.

"But it is not so much that I deend on that. I simply say that if he moral assurance is given that imericA does not disinterest herself rom the execution of the treaty, hat is enough. Then the Germans rill keep quiet. And the Turks?I annot suffer the Turks. I do not hlnk any one can. But they. too. rould keep quiet. And Russia will nderstand that it she wants to come ack to the civilized world she has nly to perform civilized acts. That 5 all I say." Clemenceau was addressing an inernationally distinguished audienoe. tefore him sat the representatives f virtually every civilized government in the world, high American ofiliala and even some of the men who .ad kept America out of the league f nations and created the separate eace with Germany. But he did not pare this country from blame for onditions in the world today.

"If the American soldier had been he last to join us in the war," he eclared. "the American statesmen ook the lead in the way of the rmlstlce and of the treaty.

The two street railway linos of th* District carried a total of 197,374,924 passengers during the calendar year 1921, according to the annual report of the Public Utilities Commission for that year, just transmitted to Congress. Of that total the Washington Railway and Electric Company hauled 103,602,136, while the Capital Traction transported 93.872,789.

Proposed Kates Held I p. The commission tells Congress that at the close of 1921 the proposed rules to govern the setting up of depreciation accounts by the several utilities were still being held up. The delay, the commission explains, was caused by the fact that th?* Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company and the Washington Railway and Electric Company took exception to the jurisdiction of the commission to fix such rules. Thes<? companies contended they were required to follow the rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission on depredation. The commission states that it referred the dispute over jurisdiction to the I. C. C. for report The Commissioners remind Congress that during 3921 a number of bil were introduced providing for a .uerger of the street railway companies, but that no legislation has been enacted.

I DIES OF COAL GAS POISONING. I Charles H. Hutchinson, fifty-seven I years old, of 610 I street southeast. was found dead by workers of the government heating piant at Garfield i Park, near New Jersey avenue and K street southeast, yesterday. Deatli was due to coal gas poisoning. because I am here as a man who has been charged with imperialism and militarism. And to explain my position I must say that your country helped to make it. I am asked foi what precise object I came to America. "I came to ask you why you went to war. Did you go to war to help France reject the enemy? It is no: dt>ne. Did you go to make democracy safe? Look afar and you see the barbary of Turks and the anarchy of Russia and the need of revenge .?f Germany grouped and met together under the treaty of Rappola that sets them together, these three powers. Krupp Busy In Russia. "Krupp is working in Russia and a British general not long ago w ho was in Asia has told me that he received his pay in Russian gold. It is easy 10 understand what that means." Ciemenceau found no escape for America in the excuse that when President Wilson accepted the league of nations and promised Americas participation in a three-power defensive treaty between Great Britain, France and the United States, he did not represent the spirit or wishes of the American peopit. Wilson, he said, came to Europe as the chief executive of the American government and the peace conference couid not. refuse to accept him as the official representative of this nation. He paid high tribute to the sincerity of the former President. "I have but one message, only one message." he said. "It is the plainest that can be conceived. Peace. I care for all men I do not ask for money. 1 do not ask for protection. I do not ask for help. I ask for nothing but friendship and good heart and good will. These are more valuable to me than all your gold, although y u have a great deal of it. My message is peace?peace by any means. "Whatever you do, beforehand we want peace. Our country has its soldiers, but we do not like to keep them; we do not like to see our young men In the ranks when they ought to be in the workshops and in the bureaus. We would be very glad to disband these young men. We are not a militaristic nation. But for fifty years we have been suffering the results of a hard peace, and for fifty ycsro wo Ileal u will mm 11 cfCB rv u i us and of his dry powder." Referring to the German reparations. Clemenceau said he did not know what France would do. The negotiation there would be hard, he said, since the points of view are not the same. There is some talk of France accepting a lump sum and ending that controvery. the "Tiger" declared. "I hope." he continued, "the French will defend the right cause, for if we are left without money, without power, what can you reasonably expect of us'."" "During the war." ho said, "we were fighting, and before you had begun to fight we were spending lavishly of our blood and our gold We had given of our blood, we had given of our gold. And with your great, good help we won the day. Ill the meantime, however, we had been obliged to borrow money from America to apend in American markets. Wilson's Karne Applauded. "That is the case of our debt to you. That debt we owe. we do not overlook it, but don't you understand that under the conditions that I have described, unless Germany pays us. and If Germany Is not allowed to pay us. what cut we do. I have niv natch and my sold spectacles, but that Is all 1 can offer." Frequently the "Tiger" was interrupted by outbursts of applause, and particularly when he mentioned Prttident Wilson and America's part in framing the peace treaty. He spoke for more than an hour. Clemenceau entered (he hall at 3:07 o'clock. The place was crowded by that time. On the stage were the entire official family of the French embassy, members of the House of Representatives committee on foreign relations and other high government officials, besides officers of the- International Lyceum and Chautauqua Association, under whose auspices the meeting was convened.
