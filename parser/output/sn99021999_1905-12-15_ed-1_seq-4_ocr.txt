T.DCCATIMi THE 1SD1AX The present commissioner ' of Indian affairs, Francis E. Lenpp, has Ideas re- g-ardlng the method that should be rur tied In educating the Indian which If not altogether novel are certainly Inter eUuj(. In his annual report he points out that the Indian has as distinct an Individuality as any type of man who ever lived and In order to Judge him aright we must learn to measure him by bis own standards. Little can be done to change the Indian who has already passed middle life. He Is likely to re main an Indian of the old school to the last. But something can be done with the younger adults, though the main hope lies with the youthful generation, who are still measurably plastic We must educate the-, boys and srlrfs. rather than merely Instruct them, Is the admonition of the commissioner. He thinks the ordinary Indian boy is better equipped for his life struggle on a fron tier ranch when ho can read the simple English of the local newspaper, can write a short letter which la intelligible and knows enough of figures to discover whether the storekeeper is cheating him. Having aciuired this bis time could be put at its best in learning how to do those practical tasks which are likely to fall to him. A like method of instruc tion should apply to the Indian girls. Give them the rudiments of an educa tion and then let them learn the ordinary domestic tasks and duties, so that they may be qualified to take care of a home. This is a common sense view and there can be no doubt 'that had it been adopted long ago the condition of the Indian generally would be better than It is, though on the whole it Is now com paratively satisfactory. Commissioner Leunp has made a moat careful study of Indian character and therefore what he says merits attentive consideration. RtSTMCTlXa 

COTTOX PRODUCTION. The acreage planted in cotton this year was less than the preceding year and of course there was a corresponding decrease in the ctod. with result In ir higher prices for the staple. The plant ers are advised by the president of the Southern Cotton association not to in crease the acreage next year, It being urged that the present estimated 27,000, 000 acres is sufficient under normal cli matic? conditions to produce enough cot ton to meet the demands of the spinners. It is declared that the legitimate law of supply and demand is the only true me dium of regulating fair and legitimate prices of cotton. The matter is one in which all con sinners of cottou goods are more or less Interested. It Is also one which 1ms a very Important relation to our foreign commerce, in which the exports of cot ton occupy the leading place. It is very probable that the planters will heed the advlcv not to Increase the cotton acre litre, and if so the Increasing demand miiHt inevitably raise the price. If this should go on for a few years the effect would be to make cotton goods almost a luxury, materially reducing the -'t- elgn demand for It and also the home consumption. Then would come a reac tion and in the end the planters would be no better off. Moreover the policy ad vised would stimulate efforts in new fields of production, so that the southern producers might find themselves con fronted with a formidable competition. The counsel of the president of the cot ton association Is of questionable wis dom. 

TARIFF US PHILIPP1SK PRODUCTS. The house committee on ways and means has entered upon a hearing re garding the question of reducing 'the tariff on Philippine sugar and tobacco. President Roosevelt in bis message and Secretary Taft In his annual report urged a reduction to 25 per cent of the Dlngley rates on those products of tho Islands, all other products to come Into the United States free. The proposed reduction on sngar and tobacco is oi- posed by the domestic Interests. In an interview a few days ago Mr. Thomas F. Walsh of Colorado declared that if sugnr is admitted to the Amer ican market at '5 per cent of tho Dlng ley duty the effect will be to kill the beet augar Industry in his Ktate. .He paid that Cuba and the Philippines could soon produce all the &ugar consumed In the United States and that the cheap labor there would starve the American sugar beet raiser out of business. He expressed the opinion that the proposi tion is merely a design on the part of enormously rich, greedy speculators, who are Milling to adopt any means for the accumulation of more money. They propose to exploit the Philippines for their own selfish euds. "It means." said Mr. Walsh, "the ultimate ruin of an In- dustry that is full of the brlghest prom ise for thousands of Americans. It means that the people of the United States shall pay tribute to a trust for- ever for one of the necessaries of life." He believed that if the beet euxar in dustry is protected against this danger it will aoon be able to furnish chean sugar to the people of this country, mat- lng a home market for home labor and consequent prosperity for all. But If the beet augar industry Is wiped out the Sugar trust wUl repeat in the Philip pines what It has done lu Cuba and every pound of 'augar will be under lu control. The represeatatlvea of the American sugar-growing Interest who appeared Derore Uie ways and mean committee pointed out the great difference in the wage paid in the Philippines and here and declared that the producers In the Islands art not in need of anr assist- anea from congress. Undoubtedly there win oe Heard an eouaUr earnest otmoal.

OMAHA DAILY BEE: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1003. American tobacco Interest by allowing the tobacco of the Philippines to come Into the United States at the reduced rate proposed. President Rmmevelt said In his an nual message: "I do not anticipate thnt free trade between the Islands and the United States will produce a revolution In the sugar and tobacco production in the Philippine islands. So primitive are the methods of agriculture in the Phil ippines, so slow is capital In going to the Islands, so many difficulties surround a large agricultural enterprise in the islands, that it will be many, many years before tho products of those Islands will have any effect whatever upon the markets of the United States." Unquestionably if the proposed legisla tion should be enncted It would be a long time before It would have any ap preciable effect upon domestic interests, but it Is altogether natural that those in terests should endeavor to secure them selves against the possibility of future Injury, however remote, and there is every assurance that they will make a" vigorous fight against the proposed re duction of duties.

BAXD RETRAIN, A year ago) this winter a traiuload e Bn,,ti. r.. i ii. i j of South Omaha politicians and ward """'in wuu a Drass oana accompani - ment went down to Lincoln to remon- strata aT.in.f iii...i.. strate against any legislation that would enable the people of South Omaha to decide for themselves whether they wanted that town annexed1 to Omaha or not, and they were successful In fright ening the Douglas delegation into cut ting the annexation clause out of the Omaha and South Omaha charters. Since then public sentlmeut in South Omaha in favor of annexation has grown from day to day, and It is ad mitted on all hands that if the proivoal tion for a consolidation of the two cities were now submitted It would cany by an overwhelming majority. The true Inwardness of the brass band demonstration was the anxiety of the South Omaha real estate speculators and grafters to plaster a few more mort gages on the town before they let go their grip on the municipal machinery by which they have managed to filch money from the taxpayers and fill their own pockets. It Is a matter of notoriety that every bond deal In South Omaha has been more or loss tainted with cor ruption and graft. It was perfectly natural that every proposition looking to the issue of more bonds was viewed with suspicion by the rank and file of South Omaha taxpayers and that was doubtless the reason why the sewer bond proposition was defeated at the last election. But the South Omaha grafters and rlngstersare not easily dis couraged. Within less than six weeks after the election they are hard at work to con summate, a scandalous real estate deal by which a site that Is not worth over $7,500 la to be uuloaded upon the city for 115,000 for a city hall. With this end 1n view they have, offered $1,000 to the party that has Invoked the power of tho courts to enjoin tho hsue of city hall bonds as an inducement to drop his suit, and they do not even make a secret of It. "We are working to build up South Omaha," they cry, "and even If there is a side graft In the sale of lots and a rake-off on the bonds, and an other rnk'e-off on the contract for build ing, the town will have something to show for it." This may placate some people in South Omaha, but should uot be sub mitted to by the great body of South Omaha - taxpayers without a remon strance much louder than the brass band that went to Lincoln. And now It transpires that the Doug las county board has not yet adopted the resolution to reduce the price of feeding prisoners in the county Jail from 43 to 30 cents a day, but tho reso lution is still under consideration. Very naturally the question suggests Itself. Why so much procrastination, when the couuty is paying $150 a week more than the city Is paying for tne city is paying ror a like service? Can .anybody stand up and face the i mu . . , i community In defense of this Jail-feed lng graft? The 8t. Louis Board of Education has adopted a resolution prohlbltlnz the playing of Itugby foot ball by students of the public schools, including the high school, either at home or abroad. Thbi is a good beginning of the movement to suppress the brutal sport that has been popularized in the United States almost aa much as bull fighting in Mexico. The executive committee of the Com mercial elub has taken it upon Itself to expedite the removal of Mr. Iler's tenant from the premises he now occu pies. The next thing the executive committee may be expected to tackle will be the more expeditious construc tion of the Her interurban trolley line from Omaha to Lincoln. City officials seem to have had little trouble in finding a way to get around the charter provision prohibiting over laps and transfers of funds, and county officials may be depended on to find a way to get the money to keep the ma chine running.

"The only question Is how to secure It" It seems to be the opinion of most of the generals and admirals and of a good many civilians who want things that be long to other people that the only way to secure it is for every country to spend Itt last dollar in setting ready to make a Kil kenny cat fight for It.

It has been held by some of the etrons; courts of the nation that the acceptance of a free pass by a Juror disqualifies him In a case where the railroad company it Inter etted.

BITS Or WAIHHOT01 IJFE. ' Minor Scenes and Incidents sketched oa the toot. Congressman Huff Of Pennsylvania Is one of the few men In the house of representa tives who does not worry himself about committee assignments. He knows It does not pay. He had an experience with the late Thomat B. Reed which he passed up to younger members (who sought to Im press their Importance on Speaker Can non. "At a dinner one night," he tsld, "Red asked me In a severe tone of voice If I didn't want to get a good committee assignment to that I could work. "No, I came here to rest," raid Huff. When the committee assignments came out Huff was down as a member of the committee on postoftlcet and pott roads. That year the committee worked four hours every day and the colonel scarcely had time to an swer letters from hit constituents. Mem bers that pestered the speaker got as signments to the committee on ventflstlnir and acoustics. The Oklahoma boomers have set a mark In the line of mascots.

Instead of doing business, he Is putting work off on others, a iimni. i... of Inquiry to a department has been known to bear on Its face over twenty references before the information desired by a cltlsen was forthcoming. Coincident with this mighty work of "reference," are many, many letters, and wordy letters at that. In each of which the case Is restated In Its entirety. The worst thing that can befall many an ablebodled man, ordinarily industrious. Is to find, on assumins- office, thnt thr i. - stenographer at his disposal. This stenog rapher must be kept busy. It would never do for him or her to be Idle. The official would be false to his trust. So he dlctotes letter after letter, and weary are those wha have to read what Is written at hit dictation.

If he dared to do so the commissioner of pensions at Washington ....... , . wumpiie a delightful volume, putting therein the strange applications for pensions that como to his office. Some of these letters belong to the "too good to keep" class and they find their way out Into the world, where they add a good deal to the hilarity of na tions. Some applicants for pensions mani fest the most childlike Ignorance regarding the method of procedure necessary when applying- for a pension. They teem to think that all they have to do la to send an application to the pension office and Uncle Sam will forward a check by return mail. Borne go ao far as to send personal letters to President Roosevelt, and the writer has knowledge of at least one ex-soldier who feels confident that he had his pension rls ' from $10 to $13 a month by a letter sent to the, president telling him mat If the pension was not "rlx" by a certain time the applicant would "Jlne the dimmy crats." Soon after the close of the civil war there came to the pension office In Wash ington the following unique and poetical application for a pension that went the rounds of the newspapers at least thirty years ago, for a copy of it is In a scrap book that old: hi3LFJ!!lm'M,on'r .f Pennons Washington. these many years I've tried In vain an honest Pentlon to obtain For wound received In Sixty one at first Battle of Bull Run one of ohioes tons so brave An'S hlLt0rth froJlti the unlon ave Ajid whilst Engaged in above said fiaht a rebel Shell took liulf my sight Not content by taking an Eye this treacherous shell In Passing by took my Eye Brow Clear of the bone and Left me as unconscious aa a stone from Hill. uiiaier 01 urvsial I te.a i rrom tho jaw bone to the Ear thanks to god my life was snared Cheek and Kve hm. hm -i a and one Kve w.. ir t n,. for to wris-ht and read Poetre I hope that with that Eye to see the day when unkel Sam his Cripples will pay.

Senator Proctor's determination to resign In 1909, two years before his term expires, may be the result of political heredity, lie succeeded George F.

Advancing years can hardly be the reason for Senator Proctor's proposed retirement, and his friends are all clinging tenaciously to public life. Although he was born In 1S31 and will be seventy-eight years old In isos, nobody would regard seventy-eight ns.an advanced age for a United States senator. Justin 8. Morrill, who came from Mf.

He was born back In 18a, while 1 James Monroe was president, and his term does not expire until 1909. He Is ten years older than Proctor. His colleague, John T. Morgan, Is even more youthful, for he was not born until 1824, snd consequently is only 81 years old. Uncle Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois, who has been looking like Lincoln for the last four decades. Is two years older than Mr. Proctor, and does not regard his senatorial office as especially burdensome. William B. Allison of Iowa. Is nine months older than Mr. Cullom and outranks sit hi. colleagues In point of continuous service. Even Senator Piatt and Senator DeDew are not much younger than the senior sen ator from Vermont, for Mr. Piatt was born In 1833 and Mr. Depew In 1831. Henry M.

He hat been repre senting Colorado in the senate ever since Colorad.0 was admitted to statehood except for the three years that he served In the cabinet of President Arthur.
