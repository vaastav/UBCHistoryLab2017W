There may have V*"en some iingerlog hofe in the breaats of sim ple persons wbo are not aware of the superior l'y of p rty considerations over all others? ev? t. with men who are far above the common n.n of politi:tiia- that the republican electors would hesitate for a moment before they as sumed tbii awful responsibility, aud took the J risk of break!r? rip the con'edera ^y. Bit they | not only cast their votes formally for Lincoln, but, according to the correspondent of the leiser blacl: republican v.r.r?n in this city, they and other leading u: '.rl s o' party tool ?trVBf ground itnt the c ncllia'or . po!i.y j sagges;^?

Lincoln would be in a minority. Ills majority In the Northern Stat* Is little orer a quarter of a mlllhn In tiree millions of ro'e?. and as many as a half a million of his supporters bare deserted him sis :e tie election.

All these persons were misled for the moment; I they are now sincerely sorry for what they | hare done and ex reedingly anxious to recede | from the extreme' position into which ths bh:k republican leaders enticed tbem. And n w tha'. the work has been finished, , now that the last straw has <*caped from the Clutch of the drowning man. the general in quire i.-, what of tbe future? We can see but j little hope in the signs of the time*. The . black republicans do not purpose to act , until after Lincoln bn been Inaugurated. This is evident from the facts that tbe President eleit ' has failed to indicate la any official way his , probable policy; that the general tone of the presses in his interest Is defiant rather than con- j cillatcry; 'hat the leaders of the party, almost . without exception. condemn the course of Weed; that Grow, at tbe outset of the session, 1 lafgtd in his Homestead bill, in order to stare j off diecussion upon the topic which was upper- j noet In the mind of every member, and that thirty-eight repibll:ans voted against Bjteler's revolution. We do not envy such aen as Grow, Darlingame, Sherman. Hickman, How ard and Lovejoy their , aoe in the history of tbe country. They hare now taken the second step In a career of political Infamy mcst aptly begun by tbe endorsement of tbe Helper book In this state of things ? the So.ith preparing to go out of the Tnion? tbe friends or tbe new *la:L:4traUon sitting aitb folded hands ?the materia Interest! of &?> COuutry par ?d? It beboo%e? every good titi/eu to look the d .u ger in tbe face. If there Is a doubt as to the tmmicence of tbe crisis it may be reach rtl by tbe letteri aod spec*** of *!?? corcf rvative tree, like Mr Stephens, of GeorgU aid Senator llnnter, of VirgibU. The formi>r lately giw to the country a speech which will live forever wi'h the beet efl-irte of the pttrio'a and s*ge?of every epoch LI a now write* a short private letter, by which it is evident that he fan* the most serious apprehensions. Senator Hunter reviews the whole question, and shows th it coercion is out of the question. The Senator's letter is Ion*, bat it will be attentively real notwithstanding. As to whit is before a- no man cm tell. Much depends upon tbo ao ion of the Congressional Ceramittee of Thirty three. No bod; of men since the world began has had a greater, a more solemn and t more important responsibility in its charge than this oominlttee. If the cotton Slates can be induced to keep quiet until an amendment to the consti tution bat been acted upon, all may jet be well. But the cotton States cannot be expected to do this while the domi Daiit party in the North id obstinate, indifferent, sullen, or defiant. We call upon our black republican frlendi to give their special uttea tii -n to n ni'iht important point in Mr. Stephen*' infer. Be takes the only tunable ground, i e., that recession is revolmion, and that revolu tioc would be even more disastrous to th? North than to the Woo lb. Mr. Stephens is quite right. In the event of eecession, the real bat tle cf the South would be fwnght in the North, where there are (If teen hundred thousand voters arrajed in opposition to the doctrines of the republican party. Tne government would have its hands full hi endeavoring to suppress au arcbj and treason at the North, and therefore could not carry out Webb's idea an* whip the South into eubuiisHon. We have also, in all our large cities, what are called the dangerous classes- thieves, rowdies and vagabonds ? na tive and foreign, wko would seize upon the disorders of the State ai a pre text lor wholesale plunder, and would receive large reinforcements of laborers made reckless and desperate by hunger. Thus we should find both the federal and the lccal governments altogether inadequate to protect the life and property of the people, who would prooeed to resume the power? de egited to them; committees of safety aud vigilauoe would be established, military dictators would arise, and the free States be separated into halt a dozen petty sovereignties. The South would suffer in a less degree, a* tbe people in that section are united upon he principal point in the controversy. There is a difference of opinion as to the ques'lou of ?e cesrton; but, once outside of the Union, the South would be even more firmly united than wete thti old Thirteen after the Declaration of Independence. Compared to ours, their task is tin easy one. M<-n and brethren, ponder well upon these things We live In times when no step should be taken without the most serious, almost reli gious, consideration Tit* Administration of Criminal Jaattc* In Kcw Yi>ri-Tn? nnil||H l*??. Tbe ewe of William Mulligan, who was con victed tbe other day of obstructing an officer in the tibrburge of his duty and of attempilug to kill him, i* rather a singular one in mioy mpecta. Ab Mulligan's oounsel have brougot the whole matter before the Supreme Court on review, it ntaj be as well to refresh the I'ubyc memory with the facts in the case. Mulligan, the accuied. belongs to that pecu liar cIum of the community known as fancy men. althjugh the general public has no great farcy for them. He stated in court that be was ' a cooper by trade, but hod not worked at it for many years," leaving us to conclude that be jbimd that noble armj? the soldiers of which toil not, neither do they spin, and yet outshine Solomon in the bravery of their appa rel. They are often to be seen in Broadway on a fine afternoon; they never miss a horse raoe or a prize fight; they are habit ui's of gambling houses and other ditreputable places; they always have on hand a very large stock of political Influence, which they are ready to dispose of at the lowest cash ptice. They have, once in a while, a fight or two umong themselves, aud occasion ally get into the hands of the police. The lat ter gentiy, however, are either very thick with the "sports'' or very much afraid of them, as the number of times they are arretted bears a very small proportion to the sum of occaaiona when they deserve it. One of these gentlemen, John Morriseey? ha baa achieved a certain sort of reputation keeps a common gambling bouse, and is there fore liable at any moment to be sent to Sing Sing for two years. Mulligan comes to the bower of Morriseey, and inflicts various and sundry wounds tipon the delicate feelings of that perron. Murrb>?ey sends for the police, and direct* the officer to put Mulligan out when the latter draw a pistol and threatens the officer's life. Mulligan thinks better of the matter, however, and does not resist the law i any further. On this atn*e of facts, it is alleged, be has been convicted under aa indictment which charge* that the pistol was actually dis charged at the oflijer, and the counsel for the accused asks for a new trial, on the ground that the conviction was against evidence. There is a curious underplot to this dr.ma. Mulligan has been, in bis halcyon days, the in timate friend of many distinguished people Senators, lawyers, journalists and politi.iaBs of all degrees, lie incurred the wrath of the .>ju> Francisco Vigil?Mico Committee, and wa^ kind ly presented to the city of New York by our fellow citiMfca on the Pacific coast lie Is sup posed to be wall acquainted with all the iuside operations of the strikers, both in New Yotk and California, and when brought up lor sentence he declared to the Court that he desired to make an affidavit to prove that the will of the late Senator Broderick, just admitted to pro bate in San Francisco, ia a forgery. Tbe will was contested on this ground, but the Probate Judge did not deem the evidence sufficient to set it aside. The late Senater by this will de vised tbe whole of his property, valued at something like $100,000, to the editor of a sporting paper in this city? a warn friend, it is said, of Mulligan. Tbe will case goot to the Supreme Court of California on appeal, and Mulligan declared that he wlahed hi* affidavit to go before that tribunal. Judge Gould de nied the request of the accused, and proceeded to sentence him. We are of '.be opinion thfct the facie above recited need no commentary at out hands. Tbe public will, however, note tbe cltrnm ?bM that Morriseey had no hesitation in calling for tbe aii of the police, although, if they bud tinte tbrlr duty, he wonld have been owct'd < f to p-leoo Tfcey *-Hl peroHre too, tic,'. Mllfgar wfec hue often been in the hands of the police ou Mrtoua charged, hu c )dw to grief for a comparatively alight offeuce. This ia on the old prinoiple, give a dog a bad Dame, tie., and it should serve as a Earning to youog men who think it a fine tbing to follow in the wake of the fancy men like Mulligan. It will give the "governing clauses" a hint, to the effect that thej cannot have everything their own way, and will teaoh them to walk etr&ighter than before. As to Mulligan's very extraordinary state ment with regard to the Broderick will, we presume the contestants will take measures to ascertain how mnch truth, if any, there is in it If the will was forged? it bears date the day beftre the Senator left New York for San Francis o the last time? there must be other witnesses than Mulligan; if not, there yet re mains a way to secure bis evidence through a pvrdon, wbich might be made out a day or two before the time for him to pay his legal adieux to Sing S ng comes around. Of course tbe matter will be propeily Investigated, and the public will expect eorae rich developements lu ibe meantime, Mulligan, though sentenced to tbe State Piison, remains in the Tombs. Wby ? The PnrsrpKvr on Our Foreign Relations ? In remarkable contrast with the discordant and revolutionary condition of our domestic nffairs, our relations with foreign governments, from England and France to China and Japan, ?re cheeringly represented in the President's Menage as of "the moBt frien'dly character.'' There is muoh to console us in this. that at ?ea*t in tbe midst of our present overshadowing domestio troubles and dangers we have no ap parent cause to fear, should disunion be preci pltated upon us, it will involve a hostile descent upon our seaboard of European fleets of bombarding gunboats. But bow. at tbis crbia of dlpanion, are we to iccount for the reiteration bj Mr. Buchanan of bis recommendation of 1S58 and l&f>9 "in ftvot of the acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purchase." Be believes that the acquieitian would result to the advantage of both countries ??tor all future time," atd that it would ' prove ? he certain means of immediately abolishing the African slave trade throughout the world.'' Hut upon what hope does Mr. Buchanan reiterate tbis recommendation at tbis time? Manifestly upon tbe hope, wbich he has Mibs?antially expressed, that tbis fearful Htorui ot dissolution will blow over, and that the Union will emerge from it not only unbroken, but stronger than ever. Perhaps, too, tbis proposition to buy Cuba is 'bro*n out as a contingent makeweight in the work of restoring peace between the North and the South. We fear, however, that the day for the con sideration of this item of acquisition in the re construction of tbe balances of sectional pow er within tbis Union is gone, and that the pro position in our Congress for the purchase of Cuba will never be heard of again. But, as npon no other basis than tbe perpetuity of the Union could the President make up bis annual Menage to Congress, he consistently reproduces our domestic and foreign relations as those of an established and enduring government. Hence tbis recommendation concerning Cuba, and hence bis renewed appeal to the Senate for the ratification of certain treaties, comprehend ing important commercial concessions to us trom tbe liberal government of Mexico. In the event of disunion, however, the North inty relinquish all hopes of Mexico, for its " ma nifest destiny " will be absorption into the Southern confederacy. Mr. Buchanan congratulates the two bouses on the fact that, since last De cember, "not a single slave haa been im ported into the United States, in vio lation of the laws prohibiting the African slave trade," and that filibustering has been suppreseed. Under ordinary circumstances, these things would command the public atten tion, but at this extraordinary crisis, in spejk iDg of U?-m, Mr. Buchanan's voice is lost in the roaring storm which is aroand us. S3, too, touching his suggestions in reference to a Pacific Railroad, and to a naval force for the protection of American interests in Central America. Ever} thing is swallowed up in this awful question of disunion; nor, 'henceforth until this question ia settled, one way or the other, can we expect an} tbing elae for tbe country'e government to command the atten tion of Congresa or the Amerioah people. Orn Rkitiujcan Cormroautui on thi PiuuiXT'a Mm&uon. ? It vu not to b? ex pected that Mr. Ituch mau'? view* upon the flavor y question, and tb?> ciutfs which he might H?ign. and the remedies which he might propose, for this disunion agitation in the South, v. ould be satisfactory to our republican news paper cotemporarles Cnt some of them are even more violent thin we had anticipated they would be in their denunciations again <tths President and his Menage on this occasion. Our impetuous philosopher of the TrSbum opens his commentary upon the Message with this refreshing rsntenoe:? "Let us devoutly thank God that, for the ensuing four years, th? people of the United States are relieved from the annual vMttttion of a long Presidential lec ture wherein reason is iosulted, humanity out raged. history traveetied and oomaon sense defied, in the interest of human slavery and for the gratification of Its upholders." This be tx.ys the amiable temper of Masea Greeley; but the 'iittle villain" of the quadrilateral in quite as refractory, for be fltt.ly says that "the llfssage. In our judgment, is an incendiary document, and will tend still further to exisp^ ratethe sectional dissensions of the day." But Thurlow Weed is open to conviction. The scales have fallen from hi? eyes, and he can see that the Union is in danger, and that only conciliation can save it lie rather likes tbe Message. He says:? "There is evidence in its structure and upon its face that it was con ceived and written in a patriotic spirit, and with a lofty purpose," but that "to arguments so strong tad clear, to conceptions so elevated, conclusions so illogical and lame have no fit Dees or affinity " Bat still, says the thinking Tharlow, "of good taken separately, there is enough In Um Message to brighten the darkened skies, enough to build sanguine hopes upon, enough even to avert tbe threatened danger.'' Tburlow Weed has some comprehension of this ciisia lie is, therefore, inclined to drop Sambo to save the Union and Llnooln's adml nistration. Greeley continues intractable; but he wDl In dne season discover that over a Soatbern agitation which Is shaking tbe Uuion to its foundations, this Northern repnblioan party must abandon Its antl slavery platform or that It will ap eedtly fill to pi?o?9 S*??itt<erB PriptrMl?? hf ??t?| Omt ?f tlii Union, Hd NortU?ra tffMVM to PrtTtBl It. It is with great pleasure we refer to the ac tion of leading Uuion men ia New Jeraey, who have lemed a call for a mass convention to be held on the 1 1th of thia month, to take inte consi deration the present alarming condition of the politic H affairs of the country. Thia is the first move at the North to meet the crisis, and we hope to see it followed up immediately by simi lar calls In other States. The danper is imminent and pressing, and thero is not a moment to be lost Six Southern 8tates are to hold their conventiona all within a month, to decide upon going out of the Union. South Carolina leads tbe way on the 18th inst, while she is making active armed preparations to maintain her independence, and the same U true of Georgia and other Southern States. The tact of South Carolina alone going out would he comparatively of small consequence; but when it is taken' into consideration that she is merely in the van of secession, and that the other States have stipulated to follow her lead, then the act of revolution on her part assumes an importance the magnitude of which cannot be over estimated. It is like the first devoted regiment that assaults a fortress ?it has despe rate courage because it knows that other brave battalions are advancing at It* back. The South Carolina Convention, as we have said, meets in twelve days; the Florida Con vention in a fortnight alter, on tho ;id of Janu ary. In four days more two State Conventions meet on the same day ? Alabama and Missis sippi? on the 7th of January; on the the next day a Conveu'lon is to be held in Texas, on the 8th of January; and on the next day after a Convention in Georgia, on the i'th of January. Now. all these are sovereign conventions of the people, regularly called by the Legisla tures, with one exception, and possessing high er powers than the Legislatures themselves. There is an Idea prevalent at the North that because they are conveuiiocs they ate of lii-tle consequenoe. while the Legislatures do no! act. But this is a grave error. These meet ings are formidable just becau?e they are meet ings of conventions and not of Legislatures; for in our system of government the sovereignty resides ultimately in the people, solemalv as sembled in convention, and in the constitution that sovereignty is exprecsly reserved to the people. It was by convention that the citizens of each State, one after another, ratified the Uuion. and it is now by the same forms that the people of the Southern States are proceeding, one by one, to arnul the acta by which they adopted the constitution. Nor is the movement confined to the six States we have named. The other slave States aTe preparing to follow their example. On the 10th of December the Legislature of Louisiana is summoned to meet for the purpose of calling a convention; on the 7th of January the Legis lature of Virginia will assemble for the same purpoee: and the people of Maryland desired to have the Legislature called, but the Gover nor refused to respond. What tfcey may do in this contingency is no' yet determined. In Texas tbe Governor. Sam Houston? who is a strong Union man, and whose term of office has a year yet to run? declined to act incompliance with the wiehes of the people; but they took the power into their own hands, and called a Ccovention. as we have already stated, for the 8th ot January. It is probable that the Governor will yield in the end to the popular pressure. But whether he doee or not, bis action cannot affect the result The revolution will po on with or wi'hout fclm. From tbe fajt that in that State Breckinridge? who received the Domination of the iecessioQisto- obtained a majority of 32,000, It is very evident what the people of Texas will do. Aud what all the other Southern States, who are about to hold Cos ventioDs. will resolve upon was distinctly intimated by their representative* in Congress, I alter the reading of the President's Message, with tbe addition of North Carolina, on whose behalf Mr. Ciingmao, hitherto a Union man, endorsed the course of South Carolina, and de clared that in bis own State there were really only two parties? those who were in favor of immediate secession and those who desired to wait fot a short time to sea whether any new guarantees would be presented for safety. He added that, in his opinion, if something of this kind was not immediately done, Congress would see not only North Carolina, but moat of the other Southern States "ia motion at an early day." Aod wherever I here is any appearance of the Union sentiment at the South it U of the same conditional character as that described by Mr. CUogman as exUtirg in North Carolina. There could not probably be found throughout the whole extent of the Southern States Ore hun dred iron who are in favor of remaining in the Union at all hazards. Wherever any resolu tions have been passed, or spee hes uttered, or articles or letters written, at the South in far or of the Union, they hare been invariably cha racterized by a demand for new guarantees and securities for Southern protection, in de fault of which the I'alunists declare they are with the secessionists, come we*I, com* woe. The only dlfTsrenoe of opinion, therefore, at the South ia whether the States will go out now, or wait for a rery brief time to see what Congress and the North will do. The people of six of the Sta'es appear determined not to wait any longer, and the dances are that if six slave S'ates " secode the other nine will Immediately follow. Judg ing from the tone and temper exhibited on the part of the republican members of Congress, and from the benighted politician* and presses of the party, there is but little prospect of any thing being done in time to arrest the deep and rapid current of sece?lon, which, from all hu man appearances, seems as irresistible a? the onwatd march of the mighty Mississippi, King of Floods. Meantime It ta gratifying to see the move ment in New Jersey to which we hire adverted above It if a symptom of returning reason; and though to hope for its success is almost to hope sgainst hope, yet let us hope on and never despair. Recent eventt in Boston show that tiere Is a revolution already commenced In the Northern mind against abolition ism aod black republioaaism; but the great misfortune Is that then Is scarcely time tor the developement of the publio sentiment, so as to preeent it in a tangible, legalized shape to the Southern peo ple before the act of revolution Is ct usumm i'rd aod a Southern confederation is ai ?conmpti?b i d hct We fear the Northern e? mjaunit'es ?ill have repented of their folly ? o ?*??*. ?vl that the f'itur? is pregnant with >tamlty snd distress anrt suffering such as thciy hivo uwrer expert* nr?d sift the fn'inds'or 'j tVfmri uerrt. C?i|om Bc?C>u of Uu Dhtrtwr UwtMb Lest the ptit.Hio should not be iwu* o( tl* fact, we take iMi opportunity to inform then that we had a oharter election in this city i d the day before yesterdiy. On thla occasion the voters of the metropolis wwe siiMioned to elect the men to govern it for the com tag 7?*r? t0 disburse its finances, to make its municipal laws, to educate its youth and to attend to all Its interests in as far as they fall within tfce pro vince of the thing called government T bit duty ww mechanically performed, according to law, by a comparatively small number of votes* who are not politicians, and a pretty largv number of those who are; but the oltizens at large, the merchants, bankers, property owners, and tax paying portion of the pnblit generally, ne'tber participated in the election nor took any interest in It. TMb fact will strike any one as very extraor dinary, when we consider the position which the city of New York occupies in the Union, and, indeed, we may s<y, in the civilized world ? Its immerse wealth. Its overshadowing influenoo, its large population, the intelligence of it* people, its national character, and the vastnea* of the interests which hinge upon all these. New York, in the present political orisis, it looted upon with anxiety from every quarter of tbe country, from th? known national and conservative character of her people, and thould the difficulties which surround us termi nate in a division of the two sections of tbo ceunlry, the will have a prominent part to play and a large share of suffering to endure. Tbf ?vreseed property within the oity in real and personal estate amounts to six hundred millions; the commerce can be counted by hundreds of millions annually; the taxe* amount to ten millions a year; the youth to be educated dc not fall far short of a quarter of a million, at an annual expenditure of nearly *a million of dollars, and the population, com bining resident citi7ens and strangers, is never U se ttmn a million of soula at any one time. Looking at all these faots. one would suppoee that the election of persons to fill the place* in tb?- government of so great a city would Ho a matter of momentous importance to every one who bad a voice in it, and that the selection of proper and efficient men would bo a duty of ibe Cist consequence to every citizen within its limits. Yet, strange to eay. out of the hundred said twenty thousand registered voters on the poll books, of whcra some ninety-six or ninety eight thousand voted at th? Presidential elec tion on the 6th of November, not more than thirty or forty thousand voted on Tuesday at the charter election. Thousands of people, we will venture to say, never thought of the event at all, and many were ignorant that any election was taking place in the city: and. for the benefit cf Suoh, we will state that an election did take place, and tha?, with very few exceptions, not the be?t men In the community were chosen to fill the offices vacant under the charter? to disburse the ten millions of taxes fbr the en suing year, to make the ordinances, to appoint or confiim officials in all the departments and bureaus, to control In a great measure the eduj cation of the rising generation, and. as an addi tional duty, to pilfer a large amount from the city treasury. Many of our merchants and other prominent citizens who lave a stake in the city, when asked on Tuesday if they had voted, inquired In astonishment if there was an election g.->ing on; they bad voted on the <>th of November, tbey knew, but they were quite unconscious ihat tbey bad a similar duty to perform on that day. In fact there wa* no evljcnce throughout the entire city, except at the voting pi ices and out little even there, thai wo vrero elec-in? a large portion of the city government for the next year. And what is 'he- result of this unac countable apathy to their own interest* on tb* psrt of our merchant* and property owners? The very same class of men. and In m-iny in stances the identical men, whoa* course baa been heretofore so scandalous and fl gltioua, h*ve been re elected as Aldermen, Council men. School CommiM>iocer6, Inspectors and Trustees. Four of the Aldermen most notorious in tha Ja panese affair have been re elected; and trom the list of Councllmen it is impossible to select more than three or four individuals of .ny -i pscity or fitness for the po tion. Tir same is truea'iool the member* oi tLe School Board. Now what are to be the consequent's oi this and what does it indicate? The result, courte, must be that the city will be worse governed than hitherto ; that the taxes will bo higher and the plunder larger thin before, for these n??o will be more bold thin ever; and It Indicates v#ry strongly either that our ctti*ea* are satisfied to be heavily taxed and Bcnnd* lotuly plundered, or that they despair of mend ing matters in the least ss far as the municipal go; eminent is concerned Vising it in asy light, the result of the charter election is very curious.
