SUBSCRIPTI0N-S5.00 PER ANNUM PLAN TO CREATE COUNTY ASYLUMS. An effort will be made at the coming session of the legislature to force the adoption'of the county plan for the care of the state's in- sane population. The state board ot visitors has approved of the propo- sition. "The board of visitors will recom mend that the present hospitlas and asylums remain substantially as they are, but that no appropriations be made for additions to either ttie Fergus Falls, Anoka or Hastings Hospitals" said a county officer yesterday. "The board will recom mend that in addition to the present system there be a greater system of county assylums, under charge of the board of control. The buildings and equipment must be approved by the board of control as well as the plans before the buildings are con structed. "Such institutions, when author ized by the board of control, shall receive the inmates of that county or of a group of counties combined back from the state hospitals The state will pay to each county $3 per week for the care of the patients. If the time should ever come when a part of the expense of the care of the insane should be charged back to the counties as is done in Wisconsin, this finan cial arrangement would be modi fied." Dr. David Graham of Duluth will introduce the bill to cover the proposed change, at the coming session of the legislature. 

CAUSTIC COMMENT. LA. G. Rutledge Play is work that you don't have to do. Heroship is the first station on the road to oblivion. Every man knows his faults he is told about them often enough. A backslider gets the most criti cism from the crowd he backslides into. When poverty knocks at the door the neighbors look out of their windows. A great deal of fun is poked at the selfmade man, but just the same he can stand almost any climate. A woman takes as much pride in having a family physician as a man does in knowing a millionaire. Ambition has a queer way of mak ing the ordinary person think that reputation, fame and notoriety are the same thing. Explanations are made by beaten prize fighters, losing ball teams and people who make mistakes twice in the same place. Beggars on Horseback. 'Whoa, thar,' he says, jrallin' up his hoss, and then he whines: 'For the love o' charity, kind gent, would ye be so good as to gimme a crust o' bread for meself and a handful o* oats for the old mare?'" The sailor smiled thoughtfully and stirred his ice cream soda with a long spoon. Tes, Hal," he resumed, "there's ac tual beggars on horseback in Roosia. They travels from town to town in caravans. They beg grub for them selves and fodder for their nags, Just as I been tellin' ye. "O' course, In the Argentine, where a hoss don't cost a song, it's only nat ural ye should see beggars on horse back, and I ain't sayin' nothln' about that But in China they ride, too, while there's a Maltese beggar down Malta way what even drives a spring wagon an' takes his gal along. Inter rupts his canoodlin' to ask you for a copper to stave off starvation, then starts right in again where he left off." New Orleans Times-Democrat. An Unaccountable Failing. It was a severe trial to Mr. Harding that his only son's memory was not all that could be desired. "Where in the world he got such a forgetful streak from Is beyond me," said the exasper ated father to his wife on one occasion. "What has he forgotten now?" asked Mrs. Harding, with eyes downcast and a demure expression. The figures of the last return from the election on the bulletin board." And Mr. Harding inserted a finger in his collar as if to loosen It and shook bis head vehemently. "Looked at 'em as he came past not half an hour ago, and now can't tell me. "As I said to him, 'If you're so stu pid you can't keep a few simple figures In your head, why don't you write 'em down on a piece of paper, as I do, and have done all my life, long before I i your age?"" tAKES EFFECT IN JANUAftV Advance in Transcontinental Freight Traffic. Washington, Dec. 11.Transcon- tinental freight tariffs, beginning Jan uary next, will be advanced on all eastbound traffic both by rail and by rail and water. The class rates on westbound traffic will remain as they are now. The commodity rate on west bound traffic from Atlantic seaboard points to Pacific coast terminals will be increased approximately 10 per cent. On eastbound class rates there will be' a decrease on first class shipments from $3.70 per hundred pounds to $3 per hundred pounds. On claw? rates on Chicago and Central Trahic asso ciation territory from the Pacific coast terminals there will be a decrease on first class shipments from $3.40 per hundred pounds to $3 per hundred pounds. This will equalize the class rates on both east and westbound traffic. The eistbound commodity rate from the Pacific coast to Atlantic sea board points will be advanced about 1 per cent on the average, some of the items being as high os 60 per cent advance and some as low as 3 per cent. It is notable that the bulk of the traffic moves under the commod ity rates which show a decided in crease. This announcement was made by the interstate commerce commission. GREAT NORTHERN TRAIN HELD UP Action of FiremanPrevents Loot ing of Express Gar. Spokane, Wash., Dec. 11.Three men held up westbound Great North ern train No. 4 a mile and a half east of Hiltyard, this state, robbed the mail car and made their escape. Only the presence of mind of W. Perrin, the fireman, prevented the looting of the express car, which carried a large amount of money, including $20,000 consigned from a Spokane bank to a Montana town. The train had slowed down in the yard at Hillyard when three men, all armed with revolvers, crawled over the tender and, covering the engineer and fireman, ordered the train to be brought to a stop a little over a mile from the station. The enginemen obeyed and when the train had come to a standstill the bandits forced the engineer and fireman to leave the cab. While two of the robbers stood guard over the engineer the other took Fireman Perrin back to uncouple the mail and express cars from the rest of the train. In the darkness the bandit failed to note that the first car Tvas the mail, while the second was the baggage, and that the express car, which con tained the desired booty, was third in the train. Perrin saw his mistake and, quickly taking advantage of it, in spite of the menacing revolver held close to his head, cut off the mail and baggage cars, leaving the express car attached to the dead train. The robbers then left the engineer and fireman with the train and board ed the locomotive and themselves ran it several miles east, where they brought it to a stop, rifled the mail car, then again boarded the engine, uncoupling it from the cars, and pro ceeded three miles to Mead. There a rig was awaiting them and they made their escape. CALLS IT LUST OF BLOOD Colorado Official Condemns Presi dent's African Trip. Denver, Dec. 11.Secretary B. W. Whitehead of the state bureau of child and animal protection, in an article printed in the monthly publi cation of the Colorado Humane soci ety, entitled "Protect the Deer," says "President Roosevelt as a sportsman is furnishing to the American nation an example of ruthlessness and blood lust as farreaching as it is pernic- ious." Continuing, the article says: "No one more deeply and sincere ly appreciates the merit and good qualities of our president than we do, but these vacation trips of his are not worthy of a president nor of the true American man. Many of his truest admirers, regret his heralded hunting trip in Africa. It is not necessary, it cannot reflect credit upon him, he runs little risk and if there is any it is a needless one in an unworthy cause. If reports are true he looks forward eagerly, exultantly, impa tiently to the excursion to the other side of the world whose prime object is to slay. We regret the lust of blood, the thirst to slay." First Appropriation Bill. Washington, Dec. 11.The legisla tive, executive and judicial appropria tion bill was reported to the house from the committee on appropriations by Representative Bingham of Penn sylvania.

ACCUSES LILLE* OF ILLEGAL ACTS Complaint Against Governor Elect of Connecticut SERVED WITH SUBPOENA Called on to Answer the Allegation of Distributing Money for Campaign Purposes Through Saloonkeepers and Others in Violation of the Cor rupt Practices Act Recently Enacted In That State. New Haven, Conn., Dec. 11.Repre- sentative George W. Lilley, governor elect of Connecticut, has been served with a subpoena to answer the com plaint that in the recent ante election campaign he himself, or through a financial agent, violated the corrupt, practices act passed by the general assembly four years ago. The com plaint, which is made by George L. Fox of this city, who drafted the cor rupt practices law, enumerates alleged acts of Mr. Lilley or his agent, Colo nel I. M. Ullman, in distributing money for campaign purposes through certain saloonkeepers in Waterbury for the purpose of treating electors on the day of election and of placing cer tain sums with certain individuals in GEORGE L. LILLEY. social clubs for "treating" purposes. The complaint further alleges that the sworn statement of Mr Lalley's expenses do not set forth the expen ditures alleged as being illegal and that there were other acts by either Mr. Lilley or Colonel Ullman which were contrary to law. Mr. Lilley's statement of expenses filed under the corrupt practices act showed that he spent over $23,000 b} financial agents to be elected gov ernor. His Democratic opponent, Judge A. Heaton Robertson, swore to having spent $33,000 in his campaign, while the anti-Lilley Republicans spent $15,000. Detectives who were employed by Mr. Fox claim to have secured evi dence of alleged illegal practices in this city, Waterbury and elsewhere. Congressman Lilley has declined to comment upon the action brought against him except to say: "So far as I know there is nothing to it" OBJECT TO PORTION OF LAST MESSAGE Suggested Congress Expunge Matter From Record. Washington, Dec. 11.Leaders of the senate and house were in confer ence in Speaker Cannon's room to consider what action, if any, shall be taken concerning that portion of Pres ident Roosevelt's annual message Which relates to the secret service. Among those present were Senators Hale and Aldrich, Speaker Cannon and Representatives Tawney and Per kins. The last named has prepared a resolution providing for the appoint ment of a select committee of the house to consider that part of the president's message regarded as of fensive to members of congress. The question of expunging from the con gressional record all of the alleged offensive matter has been suggested. The portion of .he message object ed to declares that the amendment in corporated in the law last year "that there Should be no detail from the secret service and no transfer there from" contained the assertion that this amendment had been of benefit only to the criminal classes. Again, the president said that the chief argument in favor of the pro vision was that the congressmen did not themselves wish to be investi gated by the secret service men and he proposed a restoration of the old law, with a special exception prohibit ing the use of the secret service force In Investigating members of congress Moving Pictures. Moving picture cameras are remark able pieces of mechanism. The film* are only three-quarters of an inch wide. These are in rolls, sometimes 800 feet long. When taking pictures the camera man reels off these rolls just as rapidly as they are unreeled when thrown upon the canvas for the spec tator, at a rate of ten or twelve films a second. Moving pictures are simply a number of views thrown upon a white sheet one after another so rapid ly that the eye cannot detect the inter- bEFERS TO 

HILL INCIDENT Speaker in Reichstag Lauds Amsr S ican Ambassador. Berlin, Dec. 11.Speaking the reichstag Herr Haugsmann, Radical, made reference to the incidents that preceded the coming to Berlin of Da vid J. Hill, the present American ambassador. He said: "We rejoice that Mr. Hill has been appointed ambassador by the United States and that he has remained here. We dare cherish the hope that the reception which he, as an eminent and intellectual personality, deserved ana found In Berlin will serve to prove to him and the United States that the incidents prior to his coming were based on a misunderstanding in which the German people did not share, but which caused the impression that only millionaires are acceptable at Berlin as representatives of a great state. This may be true of St. Petersburg, but in Berlin, as a counter balance to the materialistic conception often con nected with the dollar, we must insist that it is the intellectual pre-eminence of a foreign representative which not only gives him right to such a posi tion, but guarantees an interchange between the two powers much more useful than can be had by the spread ing of the most lavish banquets." 

DAVIS IS ACQUITTED ON MURDER CHARGE Declared Not Guilty ot Killing Dr. Rustin. Omaha, Dec. 11.After thirteen hours' deliberation the jury in the case of Charles E. Davis, charged with the murder on the morning of Sept. 2 of Dr. Frederick T. Rustin, agreed upon a verdict of not guilty. Judge Sears received the verdict and ordered the discharge of the prisoner. It required nineteen ballots to reach an agreement. The first ballot stood eleven to one for acquittal of the charge of murder in the first degree. The lone juror maintained his posi tion for four ballots and after that was joined by another in voting for conviction on a lesser charge. This case has attracted unusual at tention not only on account of the prominence of the victim of the kill ing, who was one of the leading physi cians and surgeons of the city, and the mvstery surrounding the tragedy, but because of the family connections of the defendant. Although himself holding but a minor position in the First National bank Davis is the brother of the vice president and uncle of the president, cashier and other officials of that institution and is related to men prominent in finan cial affairs in New York city. It is not believed that any further prosecutions will be undertaken in connection with the killing of Dr. Rustin unless unexpected evidence should be discovered. Dies After Week's Sleep.
