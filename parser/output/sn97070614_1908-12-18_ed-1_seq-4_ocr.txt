DEWEY, EDITOR. OWOSSO, FRIDAY.DEC 18, 1908 Attorney General Bird received the largest plurality of any candidate in the state at the recent election. This is as it should be for the state never had a more worthy official than John E. Bird. The political surprise of the week is the announcement that the tender to Rep. T. E. Burton of Ohio, of the treas ury portfolio has been withdrawn by Judge Taft and will not be renewed whatever the outcome may be in the Ohio senatorial contest. The official canvass of the state vote gives the republican presidential elec tors an average plurality of 158,695. The average majority for the republi can state ticket below lieutenant-governor was about 150,000. Congressman Fordney had a plurality of 7,262. Through the efforts of Attorney Gen eral Bird three of the railroads of the state have paid into the state treasury $750,000 in taxes ahead of time. Mr. Bird has also induced some of the county treasurers to remit staie taxes collected to date. This will enable the state treasurer to pay the balance due on the primary school fund, salaries due state employees, etc. A re-capitulation of the vote cast last month in the country shows a total of 14,853,230, divided as follows: Repub lican, 7,637,676; democrat, 0,39:1,182; socialist, 447,651; prohibition, 241,252; independence, 83,186; populist, 33,871; socialist-labor, 15,421. The total vote exceeds that cast four years ago by 1.341,531. The republican, democrat and socialist vote shows an increase, whil ethe reverse is true of the prohibi tion, populist and socialist-labor parties. Judge Taft received 14,190 more votes than did President Roosevelt four years ago. The Saginaw delegates to the Nat ional River and Harbors Congress which met in "Washington last week have returned home and express the tope that fayorable consideration will be. given to the bill providing for a twenty foot channel in the Saginaw river, for which Congressmen Fordney and Loud are working energetically, The baglnaw gentlemen also bring home glowing accounts of Cong. Ford neys work, saying that "in an inter view with Col. Symons he said that Congressman Fordney is one of the most influential men in Congress. This estimate was also given by other lead ing men of Washington outside of con gress." Washington telegrams indicate that an agreement Ins been, reached by the Republican members of the vpxyx and means committee and the advocates of free trade between the 'Philippines and the United States on sug.ir whereby 300.000 tons will be admitted free of duty and above that monnt a reduction of 25 per cent stJi. iho given from the Dingley rate. Tbx "Amount agreed upon is 50,000 ton.i than Congressman Ford ney sugjji"! as a compromise basis two years '3o while the advocates of free sugar .would listen only to a hxyi.i of 500,000 tons. The tobacco schedule will bo handed in a similar manner. Both the sugar and tobac co Interests will accept this decision. Congress will adjourn tomorrow until Jan. 4th. Tho ways and means committee will, however, be in ses siori part of the time to work on the tariff bill.

In the discussion of the postal savings bill in the senate, Senator Wm. Alden Smith made clear the fact that he would oppose the bill unless it was so changed as to in clude state banks as depositories for funds deposited at the postoffices throughout the country. The bill now before congress would require this money to be deposited In nation al banks only, thus giving the bank at Durand- the only one in the county a monopoly of the business. Senator Smith's position is right and It Is to be hoped he can secure an amendment to the bill to the end sug gested. In his remarka he said: "Take, for instance a postofflce in a community where there ia no na tional bank. It would seem a little unfortunate If the deposits should be made in the postofflce and then taken away from that community entlrey because of the absence of a national bank, whereas a 6tate bank there might be equally secure. "Take it in the state of Michigan, for instance. The state banks are under an examination a9 thorough and effective and as complete as that of national banks. "I hope there may be some provi sion attached to this bill which will not discriminate unfairly and un justly against the state organizations that are under proper control. If it Is possible under the constitution and under the limitations consonant with safe banking, I want them put upon a fair basis with reference to those deposits. "I can conceive of and I know of communities in my own state where there is not a single national bank. I dislike to think that farmers and laborers and travelers will deposit their money in postoffices in such a community and have it carted away a great distance to be deposited in a national bank."

Contract Vitiated by Local Option Law Judge Miner decided in the circuit court, Tuesday, that Mueller Bros, of this city, could not be held on a five year lease made for a building in Alma be cause the working of tho local option law had made it impossible for Mueller Bros, and their tenant to continue to conduct the business for which the building was rented. The owners of the building had also agreed to furnish bondsmen for the saloon business to be conducted and Walsh & Pardee, Muel ler Bros.' attorneys, claimed that this was also illegal and weakened the con tract. The rent was ordered paid up to the time the law went into effect. The case will probably be taken to the su preme court for a final decision as many others are pending.

Bears tie m ml 100 r,avB lwa's Your Special Presidential Message. Washington, Dec. 15. President Roosevelt today replied to charges of the New York World and other papers that there was corruption In connec tion with the purchase of the Panama canal from the French company. Ills message is as follows: Special Message to the Senate and House of Representatives: In view of the constant reiteration of the assertion that there was some corrupt action by or on behalf of the United States government In con nection with the acquisition of the title of the French company to the i Panama canal, and of the repetition of the story that a syndicate of American citizens owned either one or both of the Panama companies, I deem it wise to 6ubmit to the congress all the infor mation I have on the subject. These stories were first brought to my attention as published in a paper In Indianapolis, called "The News," edited by Mr. Delavan Smith. The stories were scurrilous and libelous In character and false in every essential particular. Mr. Smith shelters him self behind the excuse that he merely accepted the statements which had ap peared in a paper published in New York, "The World," owned by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer. It is Idle to say that the known character of Mr. Pulitzer and his newspaper are such that the state ments In that paper will be believed by nobody; unfortunately, thousands of persons are ill-informed in this re spect and believe the statements they see In print, even though they appear in a newspaper published by Mr. Pulit zer. A member of the congress has actually introduced a resolution in reference to these charges. I there fore lay all the facts before you. Charges Made by The World. The story repeated at various tlmos by The World and by Its followers In the newspaper press, is substantially as follows: That there was corruption by or on behalf of the government of the Unit ed States In the transaction by which the Panama canal property wa3 ac quired from its French owners: tnat there were improper dealings of some kind between agents of the govern ment and outside persons, represent ing or acting for an American syndi cate, which had gotten possession of the French company; that among these persons, who it was alleged made "huge profits," were Mr. Charles P. Taft, a brother of Mr. William II. Taft, then candidate for the presi dency, and Mr. Douglas Robinson, my brother-in-law; that Mr. Cromwell, tne counsel for the Panama Canal com pany in the negotiations, was in some way implicated with the United States government authorities in these Im portant transactions; that the govern ment has concealed tho true facts, and has destroyed, or procured or agreed to the destruction of, certain docu ments; that Mr. W. II. Taft was cecrc tary of war at the time; that by an agreement between the United States government and the beneficiaries cf the deal, all tracer thereof were wir,ed out" by transferring all th archives and ."secrets" to tho Ameri e i- can government, just before the hold ing of the convention last Juno at which Mr. Taft was nominated. False in Every Particular. The statements sometimes appeared In the editorials, sometimes In the news columns, sometimes in the shape of contributions from individuals, either unknown or known to bo of bad character. They are false in every particular from beginning to end. Tho wickedness of the slanders Is only sur passed by their fatuity. So utterly baseless are the stories that apparent ly they represent in part merely ma terial collected for campaign purposes, and in part stories originally concoct ed with a view of possible blackmail. The inventor of the story about Mr. Charles P. Taft, for Instance, evident ly supposed that at some period of the Panama purchase, Mr. W. H. Taft was Secretary of war, whereas in reality Mr. W. H. Taft never became secre tary of war until long after the whole transaction in question had been closed. The inventor of the story about Mr. Dotrglas Robinson had not taken the trouble to find out the fact that Mr. Robinson had not had the slightest connection, directly or Indirectly, ol any kind or sort with any phase ot the Panama transaction from begin ning to end. The men who attacked Mr. Root In Ihe matter had not taken the trouble to read tin? public docu' ments which would have Informed them that Mr. Root had nothing to dc with the purchase which was entirely arranged through the department ot Justice under the then Attorney Cen eral, Mr. Knox. String cf Infamous Ll-bels. Now, these stories, as a matter of fact, need no Investigation whatever. No shadow of proof has been, or can he. nroduced in behalf of any of them. 'JHE

Taft, and Mr. Robinson for instaacg: But they are in fact wholly, and ia form partly, a libel upon the United States government. I do not bslieve we should concern ourselves with i- particular individuals who wrote the lying and libelous editorials, articles from correspondents, or articles in the news columns. The real offender is Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, editor and proprietor of The "World." While the criminal offense of which Mr. Pulitzer has been guilty Is In a form a libel upon Individuals, the great Injury done is In blackmail ing the good name of the American people. It should not be left to a private citizen to sue Mr. Pullzter for libel. He should be prosecuted for libel by the government authorities. In point of encouragement of iniquity, in point of infamy, of wrong doing, there is nothing to chose between a public servant who betrays his trust, a public servant ,who is guilty of blackmail, or theft, or financial dis honesty of any kind, and a man guilty as Mr. Joseph Pulitzer has been guilty In this instance. It is, therefore, a high national duty to bring to justice this vllifler of the American people; this man who wantonly and wickedly and without one shadow of Justifica tion seeks to blacken the character of reputable private citiens and to con vict the government of his own coun try in the eyes of the civilized world of wrong doing of the basest and foul est kind, when he has not one shadow of Justification of any sort or descrip tion for the charge he has made. The attorney general has under considera tion the form in which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought. Information on the Subject. Meanwhile I submit to you all the accompanying papers, so that you may have before you complete information on tho subject. I call your attention to my communications in my messages to the congress of Jan. 20, 1902, Marcn 11, 1903, Dec. 7, 1903, Jan. 4, 1904, and Dec. 17, 1900, in which I set forth at length the history of various phases of the whole transaction. I recall your attention to the report and opinion of the attorney general ren dered to me, dated Oct. 25, 1902, with the accompanying documents ana ex hibits. I call your attention to the correspondence of the officers and agents of the Panama Canal company, with the president and other officers ot the United States,, printed in Senate Document No. 34, Dec. 10, 1902; also to the copy of the official proceedings of the New Panama Canal company at Paris on the 30th of December, 1903, together with a report of the council of administration of that company, printed in Senate Document No. 133, Jan. 28, 1901; and to the copy of the general conveyance by Uie New Pana ma Canal company' to the United States, also copies of certain telegrams from tho president of the company making an offer of sale, and Attorney General Knox's cablegram In response printed In Senate Document No. 2S3, March 23, 190G. I call you;- attention furthermore to the exhaustive testi mony recorded in public document (Senate Document No. 401, Fifty-ninth ' Congress, second session), which con- I tains the searching investigation into tho whole transaction made by con gress for its information and fully considered by th congress before It took action. What Congress Provided. In the Act, approved June 2S, 1902, "To provide for the construction of a canal connecting the waters of the At lantic and Pacific Oceans," the con gress provided as follows: "That the president of the United States Is hereby authorized to acquire, for and on behalf of the United States, at a cost not exceeding forty millions of dollars, the rights, privileges, fran chises, concessions, grants of land, right of , way, unfinished work, plauts, and other property, real, personal, and mixed, of every name and nature, own ed by the New Panama Canal com pany, of France, on the Isthmus of Panama, and all its maps, plans, draw ings, records on the Isthmus of Pana ma, and in Paris, Including all the capital stock, not less, however, than, sixty-eight thousand, eight hundred and sixty-three shares of the Panama Railroad company, owned by or held for the use of said canal company, pro vided a satisfactory title to all of said property can be obtained." Duty to Purchase Property. It thereupon became the duty of tho president, in execution of this statute, to purchase the property specified from the New Panama Canal Company of France, provided he could obtain a satisfactory title. The department of Justice was in Etiucted to examine the title and after such an examination Attorney General Knox reported that a satisfactory title could be obtained. Payment of tho uurchaso urlce was thereunon made to the New Panama Canal company In accordance with the act of the con gress, and the property was conveyed (Continued on page 8.)
