Mty of a bridge over tin1 Potomac Hlvcr nenr Georgetown Uto lougsliicepisicl. Tlioonly question thit roiiialni to bo ilctcrmlntil .Is, Shall the' brtil-o liu properly constrtietoel so tint In tho judgment of those boat (Itto.l to eloclde It shtill bo In every way sife an I suit nlilo? The net of ' Kcuni uy 3:1, llsl, appropriated l140,0Wfor tin; construe lion of n bridge at or near Ooorgntenvn. Tlitit inouoy la now In tho U til tad St.itai TrCMUry nnd could bo moil In tho dis cretion of tho Secretary of War to eruat n bridge. When Secretary Lincoln ndveitiaed for proposils ono bid was received which vvns ufiiclly the nmount npproprlnteil. Hut luvo.stliH tion disclosed tho fnct Hint n bridge costing only 1 140,099 would bo loo weak. Jtr. Aberl, tho civil enicitionr, to whom tho mntter wai referrod, do cldcd that a bridge of tlia proper strength could not bo built for tho ap propriation. Such a structure ni wai proponed by the bidder "would not," ho said, '"possess tho roqustte strength for such loads ns tho froo brldgo might bo called upon to sustain." lio thco foro recommended that tho proposal bo rejected, which was done. In February, TS3, Mr. Abort sub mitted a report to tho Cliiof of Engi neers, Gen. Wright, stating that tho cstlmato for n suitable bridge would bo $220,000, nnd ho rccommundod that nn additional appropriation ba mko.l. Secretary Lincoln transmitted General Wright's report to tho President, with Ills approval, nnd n few days later President Arthur laid the matter be fore Congress. Sinco then every cITort to obtain tho required 530,000 has bean fruitless. Senntor KUldleberger lias vainly endeavored to seenro tho bjg gnrly appropriation, but Congress lint felt too little interest in tho matter to ,'lvo It nny attention. About tho noesi Bityof thobridgo thcro U no question, lint the structuro of doubtful strength which could bo erected for 14),0 )) should not bo built. Let tho work lu done well, Senator Itlddloborgor's bill appropriating 80,000 that a suitable bridgo should bo built should bo promptly passed. It Is astounding that a work of such necessity should have been delayed for llvo years for want of not a titho tho amount srpiniidurcil on dried-up Creoles and snaggy rivers. IHKI.AND'fl 

SUNIIU114T. As it is evident that Mr. Pnrnell will hnvc tho whip hand in the next House of Commons, it is a mntter of interest null somo conjecture as to what shape his demnnds for Ireland will tnkc. Thcro seems, however, not to be very much conjecture about it, for Mr. Par noil's lieutenant, Mr. T. P. O'Connor, lias mado public what will probably be asked of Parliament for Ireland. Thoao demands, if Mr. O'Connor corroctly states them, will bo very radical. It will include tho almost complcto Inde pendence which Canada enjoys nnd tho non-participation of the Irish people In the expenses of tho Imperial government nnd tho payment of tho national debt. Ireland would have tho control of lier militia nnd polico and tho power to tax Ililthli Imports. If such conces sions nro obtained, Ireland will bo practically Independent of England, but It is extremely doubtful If Mr. Parncll will mako all the de mands outlined nt once. To do go would nrouso such opposition lu both tho Liberal nnd Conservative partios as would show that hu was not handling his opportunities wisely. 1'OLITIC.I IN OHIO. Tho.Suprcmo Court of Ohio has de cided thnt there can bo no going be-, hind tho returns and that tho four Democrats whoso election to tho Sou ato was alleged to luivo been caused by gross frauds must bo given their saats. The Senate will bo composed of 29 Dem ocrats and 17 Hopublicans, tho Hoina of C8 Hopublicans and (53 Democrats, nnd there will be n Hepublicau majority of threo on joint ballot. This condi tion of tilings makes it very interesting to Senator Sherman, 113 the prejont Legislature will elect his ettcci'ssor. It yet looks as If Mr. Sherman would be his own successor, but there are mnny possibilities wlioro tho majority Is so small; especially in Ohio, where tho averago politician is thrifty. An other result of the court's decision Is nlso Interesting to tho Hepublleins. It will bo impossible for them to rodUtrtet tho Stnto In favor of their party can didate. Till: INDIAN iiiohi,i:.u, Tho mcinbcm of tho Administration whose duty It Is to superintend In llun iiiTnIra evidently studied tho subject from n standpoint of hard common sense In "which Justice was predominant nnd sentimentality had no place. While In their recommendations there nro somo minor points of difference, yet so far as practicability Is concarnod there Is great unanimity betwoen Com missioner Atkins, Secretary Lamar nnd tho President. General Atkins started tho subject In his report nnd It was fol- lowed up by tho Secretary of tho Into- 1 rlor nnd tho Prosldont In turn. Nutie 1 of them doubt for n momotit that tho 200,000 Indians In tho country, oxolu slvo of those In Alaska, oan bo mn.lu n'HcJf'SUppofllng nnd peaceable people. Work hitherto accomplished in that direction show this, The question of living llio lands to tho Indian in mv ernlty Is ndvorntod by tho Oomtttis .Itmer, the Secretary ntidthe Pftniiloht, but In the final summing up of the vIcwb of these two first -named gentle men In the McsHAgo the first proposi tions linvo been slightly modified. There is every rcaion to bollovo that both tho Commissioner of Indian Af fair mid the Secretary of the Interior will ogrco with tho Executive's digest. Olio circumscribed method of dnallng with all the Indians would not work well. There aro Indlnm for whom It would be bettor to maintain, nt least for tho present, tho tribal system; there nro tlioto for whom it would bo bttor that their reservations bo dlvlde.l mn-iit? tho owners In severalty ; lliero nro others .for whom it would bo bolter th it their reservations bo diminished In ucreii"o; nnd there nro still others for whom It would bo better If the) should have nnro land, Thoao nro undisputed facts. To make thorn nvnllalilo It is proposed that thcro bo appointed n commission of six members, three of whom ah ill beolllccis of tho army, to look Into tho ntTnlrs of till tho Indians, ascertain their exact condition nnd determine, whnt is best for that tribe and for this. This commission is, with tho Secretary of the Interior a a directing ii?ont, to bo clothed with authority to cirry nut tho conclusions that shall be reached. Of tho mnny forcible presentations In the various State papers that Invo gone to Congress lliero is none more forci ble than the maimer In which llio In dian question is hnttdlcd. And the very practical suggestions made cannot but attract tho serious attention of Congress. It looks ns if tho tlmo wore near nt hand when, after a "Century of Dishonor," the Indian question were in n fair way to bo solved. Mil. llr.Aoii of New York is going to make an effort to Incorporate In the new rules a provision that culogios upon nil decensed Members of the House shall bo delivered on Sundays. This is n sensible proposition and should prevail. A great deal of lime is waste I in tho eulogy business by Congress; nnd the business as now conducted is much of n fnrco. As soon as n Member begins to innko Ids speech about tho dead tho other Members rapidly molt through the doors and take n day off. Often there nre ns few ns a dozen listeners on tho floor. If tho addresses were delivered on Sundays thcro is every reason to believe that they could bo heard by large nnd attentive audi ences both on the floor and In the gal leries. Time would bo saved and lh4 occasion become 0110 of dignity, Coi.oNi:n Tom Ociultiiku, who Is now in New York engaged in literary work, he says, manages to get Inter viewed about every time he runs across a newspaper man. Tho Colonel has just tinned his brilliant head of hair upon the silver question, nnd mounting the throne of prophecy, says that thcro nrc millions of people In tho South and West who nro ns strongly convinced that the silver dollar must stay as wero tho Southern people convinced that slnvciy should not go. There people, nccoidlng to Colonel Ochiltree, will not give up silver eoinago without a war or n revolution. The Colonel is ns um jihitlic in tills belief ns Is the color of his tresses. Onv, of tho most remarkable Presi dential contests that this country has ever seen is forcibly recalled by tho death of nn able and eminent man in n tiirburb of St. Louis yesterday. That man was the Hon. U. Grntzllrown.who was Fccond on the Greeley ticket in 1872, nnd it was only n few days ago that Mr. Brown delivered one of tho llnest eulogies ever uttered, ills subject being the late Vieo-Projident, little an ticipating Hint ho was so soon to rejoin his life-long fiiend upon tho further shore. Tun will of the late Mr. Vunderbllt rends like a chapter from tho Arabian Nights. There's millions in It. Mas. Liu.ii: Dnvnimux Hi.aki:, that aprlchtly anil fascinating advocato ot wouinn suffrage, made nn mMross In Nuw York the other day, In which slio paid her respects to tlio President's message Shu does not like tlio nliscncu of any refcrenco to women, except .Mormon women, that Is one of tlio features of tlio message. Mrs. Wake said: "Ilo'snoko about tlio .Mormons, lie spoke about tho Indians, about cattle and mentioned John ltouch, but Ignorod us entirely." Slio than offered n resolution Hint tlio I'reslilent, by his falluro tomcntlon tho demand of tlio women of tlio Nation fur political freedom, neglected an opportunity to uso Ida Influence on tho sldo of justice. This resolution was adopted by tlio Now York State -Woman's Sulfrngo Association, beforo wliloh Mrs. llluko mado her speech. Wo do not think that Mrs. lllako can Invo been reading tlio New York Sim carefully, for If she had noticed Mr. Dana's lojlo slio would scarcely lmvo mado tills Inctaphorlcal and ungraceful kick. According to Mr. Dunn 11 woman bad 11 hand In tlio writing ot the message. Tho ,s'im contends that tho cncigHtlc handling of llio .Mormon question In the menage was tun woilc ot no other tlinn Mfss Jtoso Elizabeth Cleveland, AcronuiNn to Captain Oouch, who lias Jtttt returned to Kansas from Indian Terrl toiy, the enttleineu liavo put a good deal of llnlft Into tliclr spirit ot complying with the l'ristdeut's proclamation to moroon. Tlioy liavo removed from tho rekcrvatlons nil tlit Jr fat tattlcaml shipped them to market, Tho uimiaiKttublo cattle, the cows and tho calves have not been disturbed. When they lire ready formuiket tlioy will bo taken from tlio reservation. Hut that would liavo been done If lliero bad been no Presidential pioelnmntlon. - . SfMV IIiioKm itccclvi'd.
