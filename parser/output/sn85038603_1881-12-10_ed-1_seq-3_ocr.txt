Govern or elect, of Mississippi, made a fine speech at Concordia Hall in Atlanta last Wednesday night, to a fine and select audience. Senator Hill, of Georgia, now speaks with a perceptible lisp, but his physicians assure him that it will wear off, and that the cancer on bis tongue may be considered cured. The cranks who have been prac tising shooting at Guiteau should try their skill for it while at some village, where all the inhabitants have moved out. Maybe a stray shot might strike some of tho houses. Pinchback's idea, according to the New York Bun, is for his colored brethren in politics to aspire to the highest places, but take what they can get. This is the very essence of Republican statesmanship. Mississippi ranks as the twenty seventh as to number of acres and square miles, and the eighteenth in population. In industrial pursuits, she ranks first in cotton, eighteenth in corn and twenty-first in oats. A United States weather observ atory will be put on Kilanea, one of the great volcanoes of the Sandwich Islands. It is considered desirable to know how much the wind and weather affect the sand which is there. A smart little boy defined salt as " the stuff that makes potatoes taste bod when you don't put it on." This was equal to the other boy who said that pins have .saved a great many lives by not being swallowed. The Governor of Massachusetts did not pardon anybody on Thanskgiving day. He must be one of these timid bodies who imagine that we are drift ing to that state off affairs in which there will be nothing left to steal. Two negro men at the insane asylum near Nashville, were sent out to milk the cows, when they quarrel ed about the part each was to do in the work, and one put his knife into the heart of the other, leav ing him dead in the cow-pen. Congress met on the 5th, and the House organized by electing Keifer, of Ohio, Speaker ; McPherson, of Penn sylvania, Clerk ; Hooker, of New York, Sergeant-at-arms ; Brownlow, of Tennessee, Doorkeeper, and Sher wood, Postmaster. Both houses ap pointed committees to notify the Pres ident of their organization. A special, to the N. O. Democrat says Speaker Keifer is preparing for making up the House Committees by ascertaining the qualifications and preferences of new members and is in consultation with his party friends. It is expected that Western and South ern members will be more favored with chairmanships and positions on important committees than they have Deen lor years. President Arthur's message is a credit to his scholarship. Tin.-, all will ad mit who may take time to read it. It is specially to be oommended from a Southern standpoint, because it enun ciates no Southern policy. Of all things, a Southern policy is what the South does not want. The South is as much a part of the government as the North, and a President who has no Southern or no Northern polioy is the kind of a President that the coun try needs. Presidents with Southern policies have well nigh ruined us, aud we trust that they have had their day. As was to be expected, President Arthur is in favor of postponing the payment of the National debt. While he congratulates the country on a surplus oi income to the government, he recommends a reductiou of the revenues, "even if we delay a little the payment of the debt." Wo do not agree with him that the time has arrived "when the people may justly demand some relief from the present onerous bur den" if he means thereby that all the internal revenue laws shall be abol ished "except those upon tobacco in its various forms, and upon distilled spir its and fermented liquors, and except also the special tax upon the manufac turers of and dealers in such articles." The burden from which the people 'may justly demand some relief" is the burden X the iniquftous fWiff sys tem from which President Arthur, from present indications, will uever recommend relief. Congress iu deal ing with the revenue laws might well afford to stop with a repeal of the tax on friction matches. President Arthur, unfortunately for the country, is a representative of the class of people who have large amounts of capital, and desire that the government shall f urnish them an ab solutely safe means of investment. This, we fear, more than any love of the "dear people," is what prompts him to suggest that the payment of the public debt may le postponed to advantage. We do not agree with him; aud we trust that iu this matter the Western and Southern members of Congress; without reference to party, will stand together and insist on the payment at the earliest possible day, of every cent of the national debt. The views of the President on the further issuance of silver, are not novel. We pass them by believing that Congiess will do what is host to he done. He coquets with the question of civil service reform, and as to our "foreign relations," has traced out more than we dreamed we had. On the whole, the message is credit able, and if the President w:h not closely surrounded by most danger ous influences, we would be inclined to look for a wise aud dignified ad ministration of the government dur- iug his term of office. as he is able and willing to discharge the duties of his exalted position, and despite the potiy crossings of the few, we feel certain that our legislature will ;honor the State and themselves by returning him without dissent. 

PUBLIC EDUCATION . Among the many matters that claim the attention of our legislature, at the coming session, 'none is more important than that of the public schools. While much has been done in this matter, there remains yet a great deal to be accomplished. While the impoverished condition of the State prevented from being done that could have been wished, still much has been accomplished, and the good work should go on, and be fostered and encouraged. Every facility that can be, should be provided, to place within the reach of every child iu the State, the facilities of a good coniniou-tseliool education. Even it this should require additional taxation, we think the burden would be cheerfully borne, aud the result would repay threefold the outlay. In many localities the schools are not kept open for a sufficient Jeugth of time during the year. Three or four months session in each year is not enough to make the schools efficient. More than this, the low salaries, coupled witli the short duration of the sessions, makes it impossible to secure teachers of experience and capacity. Thosf who are qualified to teach atusot afford to do so, when they can only secure employment for lour or five months of the year, and hence in localities where the schools arc only kept open tor that length of time, it is almost impossible tosecuresuch teach ers as should be employed. Besides this, there is not pride and energy enough displayed in the loca tion and character of buildings used for school purposes. Here, in the city of Jackson, the capital of our State, we have not a public-school building worthy of the name, and what is true of us, is also applicable to many other localities. We trust tike legislature will take into serious consideration, this all im portant subject, and do all that cau possibly be done, to stimulate public instruction In the State. We should likewise be pleased to see our local authorities take hold of the matter and see if great improve ment cannot lie made in our own midst. We ought to have a first class gradd public-school in this city, cen trally located, and we can have it if we will. We want als to see some action taken by our Senators and Represen tatives in Congress, in securing assist ance from the Federal government for educational purposes. We believe this can and should be done without delay. Let the ball be put in motion at once and kept moving until success is achieved. Heifer Py lrmn1 Oxford Faleon: The noise and smoke of the late po litical struggle in Mississippi have passed away, and the Democrats are masters of the situation. So thorough are they intrenched behind the assure anoe of liberal and good government for the people, that years hiay pass and the times and conditions must materially alter before they can ever be deposed. Then instead of looking alone to fortifying the party outpost i, and making preparations for battles with the enemy yet to be fought, the Democrats should turn a little atten tion to their own household and bring atjout reform in some desmrtmeu ta, that just now stand sadly in need of it. The reform that the Falcon wishes most particularly to bring before the public now, and especially Tp the at tention of the next Legislature, is the poverty stricken policy of the Missis sippi Democracy towards its Demo cratic press. Of all the party hacks in existence, the party organ is the hardest ridden and the least reward ed. Nothing is too much for it to do, no burden or expense is too heavy and no pay too light. In political struggle, the work of one ably edited paper is worth more than fifty ordi nary campaign speakers.

SENATOR- It is the health not the eyesight, which parents with studious children should ever protect, though they should be most merciless in insisting on sufficiency of light, and light which actually reaches the object of attention. You may sit in a room full of light, but have all the while only twilight, or even a deep shadow falling on the work in hand. Light, full light, but light without glare, is the grand preservation of the eyes Scotland seems to be pushing her self into line on the land question. Delegates representing 40,000 Scottish farmers met in London yesterday and adopted resolutions demanding such concessions as have been given to Irish farmers under the Irish Land Bill. These concessions, though scorned in Ireland, would be regarded in Scotland as a boon. A reduction of rents, compensation for improve ments and abolition of the laws of en tail are demanded. Since the election we have heard but little iu reference to the election o a United States Senator to succeed Mr. Lamar. We had thought and still think that there could be no question as t the result. We had been led to believe that Mr. Lamar's election as his own successor, vas conceded by everybody. Some reeent allusions in the Brandon Republican and Canton Mail leads us to the conclu sion that there are still a few dissatis fied spirits in the State who are not iu harmony with the mos of the public and public opinion on this subject. We have before us the Canton Mail of the 3rd inst., in which appears a coiii- munication without note or comment, u which the name of Judge S. S. Cal- hoon is urged for the position which Mr. Lamar now occupies. Judge Cal hoon is a gentleman of the highest character, and would grace any posi tion to which he might be called. He is a good and true man in every walk of life private and public. He is, morever, a souud Democrat. While all this is true of Judge Calhoon it is true also of many others who might be named, and it is pre-eminently true of Mr. Lamar. In order to show the animus which inspired the article to which we refer, we quote the follow ing extract. " A liberal patriotism is about to be born into the world on Southern soil and it as an exponent of these principles that wc wish to suggest to the Deniocrae)', the name of S. S. Calhoon as a successor to L. Q. C. Lamar in the U. S. Senate. That Lamar who talked conservatism North and ultra ism South, who went out of his way to stab at his betters in Mississippi, is not a fit man in view of the impending crisis to represcut us nationally." Curious ideas of Russian military morals are revealed in tho charges upon which a number of high officials are to be court-martialed. In one in stance a company strangled its cap tain; in another, a prince lieutenant in the same regiment shot a civilian for presorting himself znoniontarily in the room of a restaurant where tho prince had made a rendezvous. Another priuce lieutenant is to be tried for shooting a domestic, detach ed from the ranks, on some trivial complaint. Nice country to live in, Russia. Almost equal to Colorado and New Mexico.

Bnmlntr of the Tenneiwee tentlAry- The Vicksburg Herald pays this well deserved tribute to Senator La mar: The prominent figure in Mississippi politics is L. Q. C. Lamar. Never from the time he took the stump in this State was there a doubt of the re sult. When he proclaimed that Lowry might not be for Lamar, but Lamar was Lowry, there was not the shadow of a doubt as to how the cam paign would terminate. He made the most glorious canvass of the State since the days of Bargeant 8. Prentis jen. JLKivis ana v oote never made a stamp speech to surpass those made by uaxaax aurmg cms campaign, and those of Prentiss can lose nothing by being placed on an equality with some of Mr. Lamar's best efforts. And the effect was irresistible. The lead ers of men were inflenced and con vinced by his knowledge, his powerful , ana nis stalwart oratory.

" If bis political friends will bring bins up as a candidate he can carry the Inde pendent vote and be elected." The invitation contained in the lest paragraph is unequalled for its effron tery by anything we have seen lately. There will be but a handful of Re publicans and so-called Independents in the next legislature. With a three- fourth majority in both houses it is scarcely possible that the Democrats will need the assistance of the mere handful of men of the opposition in electing a Senator, and we are satisfied that Judge Calhoon is to good a Dem ocrat to consent to such a course, even if there was a ghost of a chance for success. We sue fully satisfied that Col Lamar will be chosen his own succea sor without opposition among the Democratic members of the legisla ture, and we are glad that such will be the case. Without disparagement to any others we believe that we are justified in saying that he more truly and fully represents the truly liberal, progressive and patriotic sentiment of wie people of this State and of the na tion, than any man we could name. Besides this, his long experience in public life and the position he occu pies among the foremost men of the nation makes it necessary that be should be returned to his place unani mously. No one else, no matter how great his acquirements, or how worthy he may be, could hope to reach the position now occupied by Mr. Lamar, except through long experienoe and laborious service. We owe it to our selves, we owe it to our sister South ern States, and to the nation, to see that his services are retained so long Tiuji "Deuiocft .1. Nashville, Dec. 5. At 3:30 o'clock this afternoon fire broke out in the blacking department of the machine shops at the penitentiary, located in the Western part of the city, and spread quickly, despite the strenuous efforts made by the convicts to sup press the flames. Several alarms were signaled, but owing to a confu sion caused by the reception of the alarms from various, boxes, the en gines did not arrive until the fire bad gained considerable headway. The convicts became panic stricken, but soon got over their excitement, doing excellent service, in many instances voluntarily subjecting themselves to great danger. Hundreds ol civilians attracted to the scene of the confla gration, rendered material assistance to the firemen and convicts, bnt in spite of all that could be done, the flames were rapidly comnunicated to all the buildings, and consumed all but the main prison.

As soon as possible after the fire started, the Porter Kitles, Rock City Guards, and Burns Artil lery, were called upon to protect the prison, and prevent the escape of con victs, and they immediately respond ed, being stationed on the inside and outside, where they did good service. About 6 o'clock to-nisrht, when the fire had burned nearly everything within reach, an ex-con vlct set fire to the east wing of the prison, in which is located the female department. As soon as the flames made their appear ance, the women screamed ana left their cells, passing through the flames that issued from the window on the stairway. All were scorched, more or less, bnt no serious injury was sustain by any. The screams of the females and the Are, created a panic among the male convicts, who, seizing sledge hammers, axes and staves, made a oreak for the mam door ana criea m batter it down, but the guards with heroic firmness drove them back, and finally quieted them.

Harvey-J Appeal from the Circuit Court ot Sharkey county, Boa. B. F, Trimble, Judge. On the 6th day of January, 1880, Dudley rented from Mrs. Harvey a certain tract of land for which she was entitled on the 15th of November, 1880, 9800, less supplies &.., to be furnished to ber that year. On the 13th day of November, 1880, two days be fore the rent was due, Mrs. Harvey made oath before a J. P. in Sharkey county : "That O. F. Dudley will be indebted to her, $800 for rent In arrear on lands situ ated in said couuty and occupied by said O. F. Dudley the year 1880 by virtue of a lease thereof by affiant for a term com mencing on the 6th day of January, and ending on the 6th day of January 1881, for the said sum of money, payable on or be fore the 15th day of November 1880." A writ of attachment thereupon issued and was levied on lGb-c belonging to Dud ley. Dudley replevied and retained pos session. At the next term of the Circuit Court Dudley filed his declaration in re plevin. On the following day Mrs. Harvey filed her avowry iu replevin, to which Dud ley demurred. The demurred was sustain ed and leave given to file an amended avowry. The amended avowry was ac cordingly filed wherein Mrs. Harvey be sides seeking a justification of the distress under the nfllditvlt on whlchjthe writ of at tachment issued further averred "that said cotton had been removed by him with out paying said rent within thirty days next previous to the making said affidavit, aad defedant further avers that at the time of making said affidavit for rent then not due she had just cause to suspect aud did verily believe that said Dudley would re move his effects from the leased premises to some other place within or without the county, before the said rent would fall due, so that no distress could be made therefor, wherefore, &c." To'this amended avowry Dudley demurred on the ground that while the avowry contained the averments neces sary for the justification of the distress, the affidavit upon which the attachment was founded did not contain them. This de murrer was overruled and Dudley then filed his replication. The jury found for Mrs. Harvey, defendant iu replevin (aud plaintiff iu avowry.) Lowry & McLaurin for appellant.-. Nugent & McWillie contra. Campbell, j., Held The Statute (gl304 Code ot '80 entitles the landlord to an attachment for rent, "before it will fall due," on his making the pre scribed oath and giving the bond as re quired. Making oaih and giving bond as required, are conditions precedent to the issuaucc of the attachment, without which it will be illegal and will not be a justification for tak ing the goods of the tenants. In defence of replevin by the tenant of the goods seized, the landlord can justify the seizure only by an attachment for rent duly obtain ed according to law, and, it be fails to do this, the plaintiff in the replevin will be en titled to u judirmeut. The landlord must not only have a right to an attachment for rent, but he must proceed according to law in the employment of the summary aud extraordinary remedies provided for the enforcement of his right. It is not enough that the conditions exist which entitle him to the attachment, but he must do what the law exacts as the foundation for its issuance. It is not allowable to obtain the process without the required oath, and in answer to the declaration in replevin by the tenant to justi fy the taking of the goods, not by virtue of th process, b it by the facts existing when the attachme .t was issued and on which, if oath had been then made of them, a valid attachment might have been obtained. Nothing but a rightful seizure under a lawfully issued attachment can withstand the complaint of the tenant that his goods have been wrongfully taken by the landlord. The demurrer to the amended avowry should have been sustained. Judgment reversed. TO BE

If the formir is the mean ing, It is illegal and avoids the Instruments. If the latter is tbe true interpretation, It is free from objection, for it was allowable for the grantors to secure the compensa tion of counsel who served them in mak ing the assignment, just as they could se sure and other creditor, and the direction to the trustee to pay any fees which might accrue against them " concerning tbe mat tar involved in the assignment," was prob ably no more than to direct him to pay Iust and proper counsel fees for defending ils trust. If any assault should be made on the assignment through the court, and fees were Incurred in resisting it, and tbe assignment was upheld, the fees would be properly paid out of the trust fund, but if the assignment was subverted, no charge could pe made against that fund for fees Incurred in the effort to maiutain tbe assignment. Therefore the direction to pay fees against the grantors " concerning tbe matter involved In this assignment," is harmless to creditors. The whole ex pression may be no more that a pleonasm to express the idea that the Just and proper charge of counsel for services about the assignment, was to be paid. We do not know what it means, and must solve the doubt In favor of the validity of the instrument, with respect to this clause of doubtful interpretation, in accordance with the familiar rule of construction ex pressed by the maxim mt rrt maji raleat quam per eat. A presumption of an intent to defraud is not to be Indulged, but the contrary in the legal intendment which must prevail until overcome by reasonable certainty, thai the thing complained of is such as the law condemn. It is only wheu the au thority h is express to do and illegal act, that the instrument will be held void. Bump on frand, Con., p. 359. Burrill on Assig. p. 421. The court must be able to sav that the power conferred is clearly fraudulent, be fore it can properly condemn an instru ment for containing it. The court is not to ite astute to discover grounds on which to condemn assignments for creditors, but is rather to uphold them, unless they are plainly vicious in their terms. 4. The second instruction for the plain tiffs below was erroneous. It was a cir cumstances be considered by the jury, but it was wrong to say that it justified tue in ference which would condemn the assign ment. The instruction announces the value of the circumstance, and estimates it too highly.

The annual report of the Secretary of War was made public to-day. It is chiefly devoted to the consideration of impor tant reccoinmendations contained in the annual reports of his subordinates. Gen. Sherman's recommendation that the army be increased to 30,000 men receives Secretary Lincoln's earnest endorsement. He also endorses Gen. Wright's recommendation for estab lishing a torpedo system for sea-coast defence. Bureau estimates presented to the Secretary aggregate $39,001,01:0. "This amount." he says, "has been reduced, on my revision, to an aggre gate of $10,68B,000, which sum, if ju diciously allotted by Congress, will be in my judgment, a reasonable allow ance for this class of expenses, during the next fiscal year.

Further, it is my desire that each shall receive it by half a pint at a lime till the whole is consumed, each being likewise pro vided with a 9tout oaken stick ana a knife, and that they shall drink it all on the spot. Knowing what I know of the Irish character, my conviction is that, with these materials given, they will not fail to destroy each other; and when in course of time the race come to be exterminated, this neigborhood at least may be colonized by civilized and respectable Englishmen.

Hoond, of Emporia, Saturday night ; that he offered his guards $1000 each while being brought back to let him escape, and tho remov al of the Caldwell property from the bank on Saturday which Smith took with him to Newton, although depos its were received up to the Tnt min ute. At a meeting of the committee a determined man was sent after V. A. Tanner, with instructions to bring him in at all hazard. Tanner is thought to have something to do with the remov al of the collateral. Danford told the cashier here that he had just disposed of the Carbon dae Bank. The bank building at Bydell was finished but not open for busiuess. It is reported aud believed that Danford has diposed of the Hun- I newel! City bonds for $1,0"0 to some parties in iNew York. Mayor Hughes and K. M. Ford have gone Fst to look after this. The cashier thinks the trouble entireiy uncalled for and blames the Caldwell cashier for not keeping his New York account up,' as a protested draft on the Caldwell bank caused the run. All the banks were doing well, and nothing bnt crooked work could have caused the failure. OPERA IIOIJ H. K.

The Su preme Court of Misssissippi has de cided that the marked ballots used by Lynch, the opponent of Chalmers were under the Mississippi Statute illegal and void, and as they were all marked he did not receive a single eral vote in the district.

From 1831 to 1862 he won money right and left, not only from amateurs, but heavily irom profes sional players. On one occasion he took $36,000 from a party of card sharpers in three days. He was won derfully skilled in handling cards, and invented several of the swindling devices still used by faro dealers. At length he renounced his evil ways, restored a great deal of money to men he had robbed, and spent the rest of his fortune in the advocacy of laws agaidst gambling. The statutes on the subject in Pennsylvania, Mary land and Ohio were largely passed through his exertions. In lectures and books he described the means by which he won, but this after a while failed to yield him a living. His family are now supporteedbygcharity.

He said he intended to put it on the file at the State deoart- ment, asking for the position of Consul-General to Paris.
