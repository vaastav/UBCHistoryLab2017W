' ' . - - ' <-'> "' ^ : - ' ' ' -~ PRESIDED wai Mk ^ I OF RAT ;V By Associated Press. Washington, D. C-, Pec. 5? President Roosevelt's annual message to the Fifty-ninth Congress BpS was received by both branches of pr that body shortly after Congress ' _ convened at noon today, and was read in both the House and Senate. 'i..':- '? Tf IB (IB fnllniiTJ % - *' To the Senate and House of licpreg/'r scntaiirTs : The people of tliis country continne to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb / ?v. and flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community, both by the deserving and the undeserving. Against the wrath of the T?rd| the wisdom of man can not .avail; in times of flood or drought human ingenuity can liut partially repair the disaster. A general failure ofj crops would hurt all of us. Again if the folly of man mars the general well-being, then! those who are in-j nocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the business community would hurt the whole business community. But such stoppage of welfare, though it might be severe would not be lasting. Tn the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country is s the high individual character of the average American worker ,the average American citizen, no matter -whether his work be mental or~t?anual, wliether he be farmer or wageworker, business man or professional man. Tn our industrial and social system the interests of all men are so eloselv intertwined that in the immense majority of eases a straight, dealing man who by his efficiency j> by his ingenuity and industry, benefits himself must also benefit others B?;P ? "Normally the man of great productive cnpaeity who becomes rich by guiding the labor of many other men Sr?'t ' does so bv enabling them to produce Stfe jf iftorc than they could produce witn! out his gafdance; and both he and " they shnre in the benefit, which jjg;'. ' comes also to- the public at large, fcs'v _Thc superficial fact that the sharing " may be unequal must never blind & las to the underlying fact that there is this slinring, and that the benefit jpyVi comes in some degree to euch man concerned. NormaHy the wngeSpa:'; worker, the man of small means, and the average consumer, as well as . the avesnge producer, are all alike fe; helped by making conditions such JSfei that the man of exceptional business - * 'is# _ ability receives nn exceptional reward for his ability. Something can he 11 one by legislation to help tbc general prosperity: but 110 such help of a permanently beneficial character enn be given to the less able and less fortunate, save as the results of a policy which shall inure to the^ advantage of all industrious and omcieni pyojiu.* fflB am and this is only another way of saying that any benefit which comes from the less fortunate must of necessity conic even more to the more able and more fortunate. If ; . therefore, the less fortunate man is moved by envy of his more fortunate flB&g*.' brother to strike at the conditions jmfgijjpS* . undef which tlicy have both, though untf|uallyT prospered, the result will pSfe^ assuredly be that while damajfe may come to the one struck at, it will visit with an even heavier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as HbSSv! a whole we must all go up or go - down together. 

CORPORATIONS Yet, while not merely Admitting but insisting upon this, it is also tmc that where there is no govern? mental restraint or supervision some of the" exceptional men use their energies not in ways that nre for the pSPP';. common good, but in ways which '?. i tell against this common good. The nrtunes amassed through corporate IS^mHjPll'Stgsaxization are now so lnrge, and vest such power in those that wield l&i . . them, as to make it a matter of necessity to give to the severeign? that is, to the Government-'which (Continued on page 6.) IT ROOSE ENGTH ]UESTION OE8ULATION mm AGAINST HAR1 Frederick W. Word, of Pittsburg through his attorneys, V. B. Archer of Parkersburg, and F. C. Piper, oi Ruckhannon, have filed a bill ir equity in the U. S. Circuit Couri igninst John B. HarOgt al., for tin purpose of obtaining a specific performance of a contract dated Nov 4, 1904, by which Hart, trustee, agreed to sell and convey to the plaintiffs, 14,600 acres of timber anil coal land, together with the cnpital stock of the Alexander and Rich Mountain Railway Co., in consideration of $250,000 cash. The bill alleges that after the contract was made, in abstracting titles, it was found that they wefe defective in many points, and that Hart did not have any title to 1,000 acres in Randolph county included in the contract of sale, which the plaintiff values at $3,000. Plaintiff also charges that after the date of contract, Hart, trustee, has endeavored to avoid the effect of his agreement and has procured, without the knowledge of the plain tilt a decree for the sale of thxs property in the circuit court of Upshur county by G. M. Fleming, U. G. Young and J. W. Davis, special commissioners. These commissioners caused the whole tract of land "'to be advertised for sale, as well as all the property of the railroad company, which sale was to take place Tuesday, December 5. at Buckhannon. Judge Dayton entered a decree, enjoining the sale. This is the same property that formerly belonged to the Randolph Coal and Lumber Company.
