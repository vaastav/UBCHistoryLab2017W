In an snilee ou strikes published in the American s Lake Charles, La., anaoT g sthssr interesting and sensible Iting occurs the following : hp right of free lab r is one of tue ni ml SBjcrpd der the coustitu lion. By fine la r we mean the right at ewer? ian to etk employ ees', where pleases and work tor what twice hv I b sea. The right of the employer io dis-! haras incompetent men and replace them by others to suit the contingen cies of the work. The rights of business, dependent spon the railroads, to be fully pro tected so as not to suffer material loss ' fry any failure of the common carrier. The rights of labor, depending upon asinesa, require that they should not be thrown out of employment at the aaprice of some irresponsible third The admission into our American system of labor and business method f force of the most arbitrary and des potic character. A strike on a railroad is criminal because it violently interferes with property it does not own, and it is a blow against the public peace and prosperity."
