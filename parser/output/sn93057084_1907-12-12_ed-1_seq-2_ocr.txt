ROOSEVELT STANDS FOR REGULATION OF BIG CORPORATIONS 'n Messaga Delivered Tuesday He Urges a National In corporation Act. MONEY REFORM IS NEEDED He Leaves it to Congress to Select Plan, but Inclines Toward Guar anty Fund for Protection— Many Points Covered. Washington. V». C„ Doc. 3. Pres ident Roosevelt today sent his annual message to the sixtieth congress, and it was read in liolh brunches ol: tlic iissemhl}. Jn part the message Is us follows: The Senate and House of Represent atives: No nation has greater re sources than ours, and I think it can be truthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess Krealor energy and industrial ability. In no nation are the fundamental business conditions sound er than in ours at this very moment and it is foolish, when such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keeping it in souiul bunks for it is fcucii hoarding that is the immediate occasion of money stringency. More over, as a rule, the business o£ our peo ple is conducted with honesty and pro bity, and this applies alike to farms nnd factories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commercial enter prises. In any large body of men. however, there are certain to be some who ars dishonest, and it the conditions arc sncii that these men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with Impunity, their example Is a very evil tiling for the community. Where these men ar.* busim ss men of great sagacity and of temperament both unscrupulous and reckless, and where the conditions ar. sucli that they act without sujii vision or control and at tirsi without effective check from public opinion, they delude many innocent people into making in vestments or embarking iii kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successfully dis honest men are discovered, suffering comes not oiily upon tin in. but upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it oc curs and, naturally, when it does oc cur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize ihe distress of Uiose who have been misled by the guilty. Yet It Is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ulti mate causes of the sufferings, and. as a means to this end. where possible to punish those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental poli cies but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinch ing perseverence In the war against successful dishonesty. (Here the president quotes from his 1905 message his declaration for the square deal between corporations an*, people and for the regulations of Inter state commerce to this end.) I have called your attention In thest quotations to what I have already said because I am satisfied that It Is the duty of the national government to em body in action the principles thus ex pressed. Interstate Commerce. No small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self-re llance, of Independence in Initiative and action. It is wise to conserve this vir tue and to provide for its fullest exer cise, compatible with seeing that lib erty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately, this Is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation Inevitably breeds. The founders of the constitution pro vided that the national government should have complete and sole control of interstate commerce. There was then practically no Interstate business save such ait was conducted by water, and this the national government at opce proceeded to regulate in thor oughgoing and effective fashion. Con ditions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce by water is insignificant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big business concerns are now en gaged In interstate commerce. As a result. It can be but partially atid im perfectly controlled or regulated by the action of any one of the several states sucli action inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else too lax, and in either case ineffective for purposes of Justice. Only tho national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any exten sion of federal authority, for such authority already exists un der the constitution in amp lest and most far-reaching form but it does mean that there should be an extension of federal activity. Tkis is not advocating centraliisation. It is merely looking facts in t|he face, and realising that centralization in busi ness has already come and cannot be avoided or undone, nnd that the pub lic at large can only protect itself from certain evil effects of this business centralization by providing better methods for the exercise of oontroi through the authority already central ized.in the national government by the constitution Itself. There must be no halt in the healthy constructive course of ac tion which this nation has elected to pursue, and has steadily pur sued, during the last six years, as shown lioth in the legislation of the congress and the- udminlstra tion of the law by the department of Justice. The most vital need Is in connection with the railroads. As to these, in my Judgment there should now be either a national in corporation act or a law licensing railway companies to engage in In terstate commerce upon certain con dltiouv. THE LAW

Moreover, In my judgment Miere should be addkioual legislation look ing to the proper control of the great business concerns engaged 1st later slate business. tbii control to he ex ercised for their own benefit aad pros perity no less than for the protection of investors anil or the general public. As I have repeatedly said in messages to the congress a ml elsewhere, experi ence has detinitely shown not merely the unwisdom but the futility of en deavoring to put a stop to all busi ness combinations. Modern industrial conditions are such that combination is not only necessary but inevitable. It Is so In the world of business Just as it is In the world of labor, and It Is Idle to desire to put an end to all coriMirations, to an big combinations of capital, as to desire to put an end to the combinations of labor. Corporation and labor union alike have come to stay. Each. If properly managed Is a source of good and not evil. Whenever In either there is evil. It should be promptly held to account but It should receive hearty encouragement so long as it Is properly managed. It Is pro foundly Immoral to put or keep on the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of public morality, that really puts a premium upon public immoral ity, by undertaking to forbid honest men from doing what must be done un der modern business conditions, so that the law Itself provides that its own in fraction must be the condition prece dent upon business success. To aim at the accomplishment of too much usual ly means the accomplishment of too '.iltle, and often the doing of positive damage. Forbid the Evil Combination. (Here the president cited previous ex pressions to the effect that the Sher man anti-trust act is so framed that the business ui the country cannot be londuci without, breaking it. The aiiti! in:st law should not be repealed but it should be made both more efficient, and more in harmony with actual conditions. It should be amended so as to forbid only the kind of combin atlon which does harm to the gen eral public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be an Incident of, a grant of supervisory power to the government over these big concerns engaged In In terstate business. This should be accompanied by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjection of books and papers lo the inspection of the government officials. A beginning has already been made for such supervision by tho establishment of the bureau of corporations. The anii-tnifit law should not pro-' Mbit combinations that do no injustice t.o the public, still less those the ex istence of which is on tho whole of beneltt to the public. Hut even if this feature of the law were abolished, there would remain as an equally ob jectionable feature the difficulty and lelay now Incident to Its enforcement. The government must now submit to irksome and repeated delay before ob taining a tlnal decision of the courts upon proceedings Instituted, and even a favorable decree may mean an empty -•ictory. Moreover, to attempt to con trol thest? corporations by law suits means to impose upon both the depart ment of justice and the courts an Im possible burden it is not feasible to carry on more than a limited number of such stilts. Such law to be really effective must of course be admin istered by ar. executive body, and not merely by means of law suits. The de sign should be to prevent the abuses incident to the creation of unhealthy .md Improper combinations, instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to destroy them by uivil or criminal proceedings. Condemns Trusts in N«ceuiti«s. A combination should not be tol erated if it abuse the power ac quired by combination to the pub lie detriment. No corporation or association of any kind should be permitted to engage- in foreign dr Interstate commerce that is formed for the purpose of, or whose op erations create, a monopoly or gen eral control of tho production, sale, or distribution of any one or more of the prime necessities of life or articles of general use and neces sity. Such combinations are against prblic policy they violate the comir.cn law the doors of the courts are closed to those who are parties to them, and I believe the congress can close the channels of Interstate commerce against them for Its protection. The law should make Its prohibitions and permis sions as clear and definite us pos- -. sib'.c leaving the least possible room for arbitrary action, or al legation of such action, on the part of the executive or of divergent interpretations by the courts. Among the points to be aimed at should be the prohibition of un healthy competition such as by rendering service at an actual loss for the purpose of crushing out competition, the prevention of in Ration of capital, and the prohi bition of a corporation's making exclusive trade with itself a con dition of having any trade with itoelf. Reasonable agreements be tween, or combinations of corpora Hons should be permitted, provided they are tii-st submitted to and ap proved by some appropriate gov ernment body. THE 

CONGRESS HAS THE POW ER TO CHARTER CORPORATIONS TO ENGAGE IN INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE. AND A GEN ERAL LAW CAN BE ENACTED UN DER THE PROVISIONS OP WHICH EXISTING CORPORATIONS COULD TAKE OUT FEDERAL CHARTERS AND NEW FEDERAL CORPORA TIONS COULD HE CREATED. License as an Alternative. An essential provision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by somo federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter was an association or combi nation within the restrictions of the federal law. Provision should also be made for complete publicity in all mat ters affecting the public and complete protection to the investing public and the shareholders In the matter of Issu ing corporate securities. If an Incor poration law Is not deemed advisable, a license uct for big interstate corpor ations might be enacted or a combi nation of- the two might be tried. The supervision established might be an alogous to that now exercised over na tional banks. At least, the anti-trust act should oe supplemented by sitecilic prohibitions oi me methods which ex perience has shown have been of most service in enabling monopolistic com binations to crush out competition. The real owners of a corjMiration should be compelled to do business in their own name. The right to hold stock in other corporations should hereafter be de nied to Interstate corporations unless on approval by the proper government officials-, and a prerequisite to such ap proval should be the listing with the government of all owners and stock holders, both by the corporation own ing such stock and by the corporation in which such stock Is owned. To confer upon tile national gov ernment. in connection with the amend ment I advocate In the anti-trust law, power of supervision over big business concerns engaged in interstate com merce, would benefit them as it has benefited the national banks, in the recent business crisis It is noteworthy that the institutions which failed were Institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the national government. Those which were under national control stood the test. Would Help the Railroads. National control of the kind above advocated would be to the benefit of every well managed railway. From the standpoint of the public thero is need for additional tracks, additional terminals, anil improvements in the actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly as possible. Ample, safe and speedy transportation facili ties are even more necessary than cheap transportation. Therefore, there is need for the investment of money which will provide for all these things while at the same time securing as far as is possible better wages and shorter hours for their employes. Therefore, while there must be just and reason able regulation of rates, we should be the first to protest against any arbi trary and unthinking movement to out them down witlioiu the fullest and most careful consideration of all in terests concerned ami of the actual needs of tin. situation. Only a spe cial body of men acting for the na tional government tinder authority con ferred upon it by the congress is com petent lo pass Judgment on such a matter. .*ure Food Law a Success. Those who fear, from any rea son, the extension of federal ac tivlty will do well to study the history not only of the national banking act but of the pure food law, and notably the mcnt Inspec tion law recently enacted. Tho puro food law was opposed so vlo lently that its passage was de layed for a decade yet it has worker unmixed and Immediate good. The meat inspection law was even more violently assailed and the same men who now de nounco the attitude of the na tional government In seeking to oversee and control tho workings of interstate common carriers and business concerns, then asserted that we were "discrediting and ruining a great American indus try." Two years have not elapsed, and already It has become evident that the great benefit the law con fers upon the public is accom pllshed by an equal benefit lo the reputable packing establishments. The latter are better off under the law than they were without it. The benefit to interstate common car riers and business concerns from the legislation 1 advocate would be equally marked. Currency Reform Needed. In my message to the congress a year ago I spoke as follows of the currency: "I especially call your attention to the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aiding the enormous business development of the country, and within ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evi dence has been accumulating that ad ditional legislation is needed. The re currence of each crop season empha sizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them because to leave them as they are means to incur liability of business diS' aster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation in the In terest on call money from 2 per cent, to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary of the treasury had to step in nnd by wise action put a stop to tho most vtalent period of oscillation. Even worse than such fluctuation Is the advance In commer cial rates and the uncertainty felt in the insufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial Interests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call money in New York at tract money from the interior banks into the speculative field. This depletes the fund that would otherwise be avail able for commercial uses, and commer cial borrowers are forced to pay ab normal rates, so that each fall a tax. in the shape of increased Interest charges. Is placed on the whole com merce of the country. "The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system is se riously defective. There is need of a change. It must never be forgotten that this question concerns business men generally quite as much as bank ers e8neclally is this' true of stock men, farmers, and business me in the west for at present at certain seasons of the year the difference in interest rates between the east and west is from 6 to 10 per cent,, whereas In Can ada the corresponding different is but 2 per cent." I again urge on the congress the need of Immediate attention to this matter. We need a greater elasticity In our cur rency: provided, of course, that we recognise the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the national authorities. -v- Should Be Elastic System. Provision should be made foi an emergency currency. The emer gency issue should, of nurse, b« made with effective guaranty, anil upon conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Sucli emer gen! issue must.

No legislation ra.n by airy possibility guarantee the bus-mess community against the results of speculative folly any more than it nan guarantee an Individual against the results of his ex travagance. When an individual mort gages his house to buy an .-mtomobiln he invites disaster and when wealthy men, in men who pose ,*js such, or art* unscrupulously or foolishly eager to be come such, indulge in reckless specula-' tion--espei ially if It is aet-oinp: nieil by dishonesty—they jeopardize not only their own future, hut the "uture of all thfdr innocent fellow citizens, for they expose the whole business communit/ lo panic and distress, Tho Tariff. Tills country is definitely com mitted to the protective system and and any effort to uproot it: could not but cause widespread industrial disaster. In other words, the prin ciple of the present tariff law could not with wisdom be changed. Hut in a country of such phenom enal growth as ours it is probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as to see that no ex cessive or improper benefits urn conferred thereby, that proper rev enue is provided, and thai our for eign trade is encouraged. Thero must always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will at least make good the difference In cost of production here and abroad that is, tho dif ference in the labor cost, here ami abroad, for the well being of tho wage-worker must ever be a card inal point of American policy. The question should be aproachod pure ly from a business standpoint both the time and the manner of the change being sucli as to arouse the minimum of agitation and dis turbance in the business world, and to give the least play for selfish and factional motives. The solo consideration should be to sec tliat the sum total of changes repre sents the public good. This means that the subject call not with wis dom be dealt with in the year pre ceding a presidential election, be cause as a matter of fact experi ence has conclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to treat It from the stand point of the public good. In my judgment the wise "time to deal with the matter is immediately af ter such election. Income Tax and Inheritance Tax. When our tax laws are revised the question of an income tax and an In heritance tax should reeeivo the careful attention of our legislators. In my judgment both of these taxes should be' part of our system- of federal taxa tion. I speak diffidently about the in come tax because one scheme for an income tax was declared unconstitu tional by the supreme court white In addition it Is a difficult tax to adminis ter in its practical working, and great care would have to be exercised to Bee that it was not evaded by the very men' whom it was most desirable to have taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, be worse than no tax at all ns the least desirable of all taxes is tho tax which bears heavily upon the hon est as compared with the dishonest man. Nevertheless, a graduated In come tax of the proper type would be a' desirable feature of federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that one may be devised which the supreme court will declare constitutional. The Inheritance tax. however, is both a far better, method of taxation, and far more Im portant for the purpose of having tfio fortunes of the county bear in propor tion to their Increase in fdze a corre sponding increase and burden of tax ation. The government has the absolute right to decide as to the terms upon which a man shall receive be quest or devise from another, and this point In the devolution of prop erty is especially appropriate for the Imposition of a tax. Lawn im posing such taxes have repeatedly been plf ~ed upon the national statute books and as repeatedly de clared constitutional by the courts and these laws contained the pro gressive principle, that is. after a certain amount Is reached the be quest or gift, in life or death, la increasingly burdened and the rate of taxation is Increased in propor tion to the remoteness of blood of the man receiving the bequest. Behind the European Countries. The principles are recognized already in the leading civilized nations of the world. In Great Britain all the es-1 tates worth $5,000 or less are practically1 exempt from death duties, while the increase is such that when an estate exceeds $5,000,000 in value and passes to a distant kinsman or stranger In blood the government receives all told an amount equivalent to nearly a fifth of the whole estate. In France so mucli of an Inheritance us exceeds {10,000,000 pays over a fifth to the state if It passes to a distant relative. The German law is especially interest ing to us because it makes the in heritance tax an imperial measure while allotting to the Individual states of the empire a portion of the proceeds and permitting them to impose taxes in addition to those imposed by the im perial government. Small Inheritances are exempt, but the tax is so sharply progressive that when the Inheritance is stUl not very large, provided it i» not an agricultural or a forest land. It Is taxed at the rate of 25 per cent, if It goes to distant relatives. There Is no reason why in the United States the national government should fast
