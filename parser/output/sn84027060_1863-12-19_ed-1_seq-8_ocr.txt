God bless you. (Signed:) A. LINCOLN. By order of Major-GeneralU. S. Grant. T. 8. BOWBRS. A. A. a. How GEN. GRANT DEALS WITH RKBEL SYMPATHIZERS.—The following order of Gen. Grant Bhows his way of dealing with rebel* and rebel sympathizers: .CHATTAKOOOA, Tenn., Nov. 5,1863. GENERAL ORDERS, NO. 4.—The habit of raiding parties of rebel cavalry visiting towns, villages and farms where there are no Federal forces, and pillage Union fam ilies, having become prevalent, depart ment commanders will take immediate steps to abate the evil, or make the loss bysuph raids fall upon Secessionists and Seoession sympathisers of the neighbor hood where such actsjare committed. For •very act of violence to the person of an unarmed Union citizen a Secessionist will be arrested and held as hostage for the de livery of the offender. For every dollar's wortn of property taken from such citizens or destroyed by raiders, an assessment will be made upon Secessionists of the neigh borhood and collected by the nearest mili tary forces, under the supervision of the commander thereof, and the amount thus collected paid over to the sufferers. When such assessments cannot be collected in money, property useful to the Government may be taken at a fair valuation, and the amount paid in money by a disbursing of ficer of the Government, who will take such property up on his returns. Wealthy Secession citizens will be assessed in money and provisions for the support of Union refugees who have been and may be driven rom their homes and into our lines by the acts of those with whom such Secession citizens are in sympathy. All collections and payments under this order will be through disbursing officers of the Govern ment, whose accounts must show all money and property received under it, and how disposed of. By order of Major-General TJ. S. Grant T. S. BOWERS, Assistant Adjutant General. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.—The plan presented by President Lincoln in his An nual Message for the restoration of the in surgent States to the authority and rights abdicated by their rebellion, will attract the widest attention both in this country and in Europe. Hitherto the attorneys of treason on the stump, and in the journals of the loyal States, have urged the useless neas of desisting from rebellion as an ex cuse for persistence therein. "If they should withdraw their support from the rebel leaders and return to loyalty and fidelity, you will nevertheless confiscate all their property and divest them of ever"v civil and political right so why should they? What is to be their motive—their inducement?" The President has answer ed the question and silenced the cavil. Every person now within the territory'of the Rebellion, with the exception of two or three thousand of its more conspicuous and determined chiefs, may secure a fall par don to-morrow, and be restored to all his former privileges as a loyal citizen of the United States, with his property intact (save that which may have already been oonfiscated arid sold,) on the easv condition of his swearing allegiance to the United States, and to abide by and acquiesce in the acts of Congress and Executive Procla mations affecting the status of slaves, "s long and so far as not repealed, modified, or declared void by Congress, or by a de cision of the Supreme Court." Here is re quired no assumption of the universal effi ciency and irrevocable validity of those acts and proclamations, but a simple agree ment to respect and abide by them, and each of them, until the same shall be inval idated either by Congress or the Supreme Court of the United States. How can any who mean to be loyal at all, object to these conditions? Ninety of every hundred of the rebels may be restored to every right to morrow without sacrificing or relinquish ing any particle of their property while ninertentns of the residue are required to relinquish nothing but their right to op press and sell their fellow men. We be lieve Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas may be reorgnized and restored to the Un ion on this basis at an early day, and that the residue will gradually follow. Henceforth it can neither be truthfully nor plausibly said that those who have onoe Deen rebels have no inducement to re turn to loyalty, no hope but in the triumph of Disunion. They may oome back to-inor row and enjoy every political or social privilege ana advantage enjoyed or claimed Djr any of us. We proffer them equality with ourselves. Should not that suffice and content them? The country must now realize that naught but Slavery obstructs the way to Peaoe and Reunion. In no metaphoric or poetic sense, the Union and Liberty, are henceforth inseparable. They will either rejoice in a common deliverance and tri umph or till the same bloody grave. Or eoune, the master-spirits of the re volt vriU not be conciliated. They have staked their all upon the cast, and must stand the hazard of the die. But what pos sible motive will a non-slaveholder have for persisting in rebellion after receiving due notioe of the issuing of this Proclama tion? Merciless bands may still scour the region cursed by the revolt, and drag every man and youth into the rebel cainps—often by the help of bloodhounds but to what end shall the non-slaveholding conscripts remain and fight? Wbat thev risk and lose by contumacy is obvious where is the counterbalancing gain? Depend on it, this Proclamation, if hecpuded and sustained in the loval States will go far to break the baok'Off the Rebellion. In Europe, it Will bo even more general ly efficient, The fendish malevolence be trayed bv the Secession oracles is rarely or never exhibited in l^urope through quota tions fKtn- the jwnrnhls yet npjie can fail to realize tho regretful tenderness and kindly charity wherewith the rebel mas ses are contemplated by the President.— Though his official terms of service has been renderad &nxious and troubled by their treason, ho has never ceased to regard them aa deoeived sad misled, and to de sire tbolr apoody return 1o loyalty and eace, The more influential British and Piench journals oonceal this, so far as pos sible, from their readers yet the truth gradually makes itself known and respect ed. But when the loyal North, through the President, proffers amnesty and resto ration on the single condition of acquies cence in Universal Freedom until Oon- §aat rfes& or the Supreme Court shall decide this is a condition which the President had no right to impose, why should any stand-out? And how can Liberal Europe withhold her ardent active sympathy from the cause thafo&ks nothing of its deadly enemies but that they' let the oppressed go free? "The Times will misrepresent and The Saturday Review defame us as usual the aristocracy may still frown or sneer but the masseB of Europe, already instinctively our friends, wtfl be impelled by this proffer to a more general ana hearty enthusiasm in behalf of that Union which now represents, even more emphatically than hitherto, the aspi rations of bowed and struggling Labor throughout the civilized world. Thanks, then, to our President, for the wise human ity and generous impulses which prompted the issue of his Proclamation of amnesty! It must be that in this sign we shall.con quer.—N. Y. Tribune. AN 

INDICATION OF MUTILATING EABNE§TNESS.—The hearts of loyal men everywhere were cheered, almost beyond expression, by the recent action of the Government in rela tion to Smithson, the Washington banker, arid Stetler the Philadelphia contractor.— The former was convicted of holding trea sonable correspondence with the rebels, the latter of defrauding the Government in coffee contracts for the army, and each of the offenders is to have a five years' resi dence in the Penitentiary at Albany, New York. Their conviction and puisbment is particularly agreeable because that in ad dition to their own short-comings they stand as representative men of two classes, large and troublesome, who have been'of incalculable injury to the cause of loyalty since the war commenced. Mr. Smithson was one of those men who, while they gave their hearts andtth?ir sympathies to the rebellion, lacked the courage and the man liness to follow their sympathies in person, aud prudently kept their bodies where nei ther the shock of battle nor Davis' con scription could reach them. Taking ad vantage of the social and business posi tions they occupied they have had rare fa cilities for serving their Southern friends, and all these opportunities have been faith fully improved. It is no wonder that the plans, laid as it was supposed in security and matured with care aud silence at our national capital, should reach the re bels even before they were sent to the army commanders, when we remember that Smithson and many more traitors of the same stamp have been open-eared to gather all such intelligence and Open mouthed to disclose it. The arrest of this £aiue traitorous banker or some one of bis confreres, a year ago, would have been a warning voice to these secret agents, and would have saved us many a dollar and many a precious life. But lor reasons, prudential or otherwise, the axe of justice nas not fall en until now. But it has fallen neverthe less, and it is not yet too late to expect a wholesome and healthy influence to result from the example. Men may as well be gin to learn that the government that has ever nourished and supported them can not always be plotted against with impu nity. It has been long suffering and patient until patience and forbearance have ceased to be desirable, and the hour of earnest ac tion has come at last. Tardily but surely the majesty of law and the power of gov ernment are to be exemplified and vindi cated. The case of Mr. Stetler is none the less instructive. Professing loyalty and busi ness integrity, he was entrusted with con tracts lor the army. A staple article of every day consumption was to be furnish ed at abundant and remunerative prices. But the legitimate gainsof business did not satisfy Mr. Stetler's avarice, and he sought to enrich himself still more by deception and fraud. He sacrificed the remains of a blunted conscience and gave up every lin gering feeling of self-respect, hoping thus to increase his wealth. Good name, honor and all were staked against the almighty dollar, but even the almighty dollar did not shield him from merited punishment. He too has had his reward and the salu tary effects of the government's action in his case have already been seen in the re mittances of ill-gotten gains from con science smitten contractors. The men who are soulless enough to coin money from the sufferings of our brave soldiers and who are strangers to every feeling of honor and every sense of shame, can still be morad by measures of severity. And now tb*t the government has found the lever that can move traitors and thieves we trust the lever will be faithfully used until traitors and thieves shall find that loyalty and honesty are politic as well as jjjgfc— Springfield Repub. OUR DJ AD.—The Chatta­ nooga correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial says: The stories so often published of the mu tilation of our dead by the rebels have us ually been looked upon as gross exaggera tions, invented by correspondents for the purpose of keeping up the hatred of the patriotic people of the North against our common enemy, and inspiring them with a determination of exterminating them. I confess that I was loath to believe the tales of horror. But I am no longer skeptical when I have the testimony of the rebel journals confirming the stories my faith is strengthened. A few weeks ago, the Chattanooga-Marietta Rebel, refer ring to the field of Chickamauga,.admitted that some of the heads of our soldiers lay grinning on stumps, severed from their bodies, and to-day, officers, whose word will be taken anywhere in this depart ment, bring the news that, on visiting the field on Saturday, a number of heads were displayed on stumps and poles, while the mutilated bodies lav on the ground, par tially devoured by birds of prey, hogs and dogs! A large proportion of our dead,left on the field, were found unburied, and their bones bleaching in the sun and rain. Gen. Gross' brigade, of the 4th Army Corps, were yesterday engaged in giving interment to the slain. The sight is de scribed as sickening in the extreme.— Trunks of the slain, minus arms and legs, naked bodies, half decayed, bones, the flesh from which had been devoured by hogs, (probably weeks since, turned into commissary stores for feeding the rebel ar my, i arms in one place, legs in another partially devoured, lay upon the ground, while the vultures and carrion birds held high carnival over the feast of dead men, and the smell was so intense that men of the strongest nerves closed their eyes upon the scene in disgust. The silver product of Nevada Territory will this year, it is estimated, amount to 815,000,000, and in two years more, it is thought, it will be fully $30,000,000, A wri ter in the San Francisco Bulletin, who has studied the subject on the spot, holds that Nevada is the "richest silver-bearing coun try in the world. Unlike California, her wealth'is not where you find it,' but her 'silver runs iu veins.' Th eland Leader states that the son of John C. ttreckenridge, who was taken prisoner at Chattonooga, accompanied the escort of thfc bodies of Colonel Creighton and Crane, as far as Nashville, aud that in conversation with Sergeant-Major Tisdel, ho declarod himself strongly in favor of the .Union. He said that had been forced into the 'Confederate service by his father. The young man thinks it would only necessary to put down the leaders of the rebellion to secure a profipt and honorable peace.— This statement is made on the authority of -:a .wjs^aek^MM "ESCAPED Tb« ship "flnj BURLINGTONj WEEKLY HAWK-EYE' THE PRIVATEERS.
