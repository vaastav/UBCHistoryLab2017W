Raise By Associated Press Chicago, Dec. 2.—Restrictions on the use of coal, already put into ef fect by regional coal committees where the pinch of necessity had been felt, to-day were extended throughout the nation under an or der of the Federal Fuel Administra tor. The most extensive shutdown of industry in history was in pros pect and domestic consumers were preparing to endure privation and discomfort as the strike of bitumi nous coal miners entered its second month. In Kansas, where volunteers work ed in the strip puts under protection of State and Federal troops and in the New River fields of West Vir ginia there was prospect to-day of increased production. In the former seven pits were worked and in West Virginia operators said normal pro duction was in sight by the end of the week. Remain Steadfast Throughout the remainder of the country, however, miners apparently remained steadfast in their deter mination not to return to work un der the fourteen per cent, wage in [ConUnued on Page IS.] First Moonshine Case Brought Before Judge Witmer's Federal Court The first moonshine case ever brought in this district was present ed to-day at the afternoon session of the United States District Court, which Judge Witmer is holding in the Federal Building. Since July 1 numerous instances of this illicit making and sale of liquor have oc curred in other parts of the country, but never before in this judicial dis trict. Vincent Basile, formerly a saloon keeper in Pittston. was discovered by Federal agents to be running a still at Harding. Luzerne county, about five miles from Pittston. Sam Sate, a former barkeeper of Basile's, was operating the place, but Sam was too quick and managed to get away when the Pittston police and Fed eral agents descended on the place. Basile was indicted for aiding and abetting the operation of an illicit still. It is said that the manner in which the still was first discovered was by the tremendous amounts of molasses which were being contract ed for by Basile.

POOR CHILD WORKS HARD TO EARN RED CROSS FUND Youngsters Turn Every Energy io Helping Those More Un fortunate Than Themselves Out near Cameron street at thei edge of what is known as the dump, i in a little two-roomed house lives a i small girl who goes to one of the! third grade schools. When her! teacher told her how the Junior j Red Cross money was used, part of t it to help the little sufferers in other j lands and part of it to help make the j little crippled girls and boys here j at home strong and well, she at I once, proceeded to earn her quarter | to become a Junior Red Cross mem- | ber. Not satisfied with this, this j child, who needs many things her-1 self, worked and earned a dollar! more to buy four other junior Rod !

LA H/S TO COMBA T HIGH COST OF LIVING, LABOR UNREST AND RADICALISM URGED BY WILSON Text of President's Message to Congress To the Senate and House of Representatives 1 sincerely regret that I cannot be present at the opening of this ses sion of the Congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as di rect a way as I could wish the many questions that are pressing for so lution at this time. Happily, I have the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive de partments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly second. In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs growing out of Federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later day of addressing you. Urges Budget T hope that Congress will bring S to a conclusion at this session legis- j lution looking to the establishment i of a budget system. That there I should be one single authority re- I sponsible for the making of all ap propriations and that applications | should be made not independently ; of each other but with reference to j one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly related to the I nation's income there can no no i doubt. I believe the burden of pre- j paring the budget must in the nature j of the case, ft' ilie work is to be J properly done ami responsibility j concentrated instead of divided, rest I upon the executive. The budget so ! prepared should I e submitted to and j approved or amended by a single committee of each house of Con- j gress, and no single aprpopriation i should be made by tlie Congress, ex cept such as may have been includ- | ed in the budget prepared by the | executive or, added by the particular committee of Congress charged with the budget legislation. Highly Trained Auditors Another and not less important I aspect of the problem is the ascer tainment of the economy and effic iency with which the moneys ap propriated are expended. Under ex isting law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether ex penditures have been lawfully made within the appropriations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, economically and effectively. The auditors should be highly train ed officials with permanent tenure in the Treasury Department, free of obligations to or of con sideration for this or any subsequent administration and authorized and empowered to examine into and make report upon the methods em ployed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the government. Their reports should ASH 

COLLECTION BREAKING DOWN, COUNCIL IS TOLD Conditions Are Almost as Bud Now as They Were in 1917 I Charges that the ash collection sys- I tem in the city Is not much better J now than it was a few years ago [ when backyards all over the city were piled high with boxes and oth receptacles filled with refuse, were | made in Council to-day to Commis | sioner S. F. Hassler. | Commissioner W, 11. Lynch, when ! an ordinance was called for final pus sage, appropriating $3,500 more for I ash collections this yenr, said he was | receiving many complaints daily, the 'so me as a few years ago. He told the other Councilmen that the bureau of ash and garbage inspection should follow a regular schedule for ash col lections as required in an ordinance passed last year. Commissioner Hassler explained that ash collections had not been made regularly during the last few weeks because of a lack of equip ment, which had been ordered, but has not been delivered yet. He said llit bureau attempted to do the work for $40,000, but found that it would be impossible to complete the year with that amount, some of it having bten used during the summer to buy horses and wagons. Mr. Lynch and other Councilmen said they were not opposed to pro viding more revenue for the bureau, but did want the collections made on a regular schedule during the winter months, so that there would be no further complaints about mu nicipal service. The ordinance appropriating $3,500 to the ash collection bureau was passed finally. it also appropriated $4,000 to the fire department contln-1 gent fund and $4,000 to be used to pay fdr laying underground police and fire alarm connections for the city. I'. S. SHIP OFF SPALATO Qopenliagen. Dec. 2.—A number of allied warships, including an American vessel, were cruiAing off Spalato, on the Dalmatian const, on Sunday, according to a Luibach dis patch received here.

Ileckert, Ills Market street, was arrested early this uft crnoon and held under S3OO bull for court be made to the Congress and lo the Secretary of the Treasury. Asks Tax Consideration 1 trust that the Congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation. Sim plification of the income anil profits taxes has become an immediate ne cessity. These taxes performed in dispensable service during the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayer incon venience and expense, but in order that his liability may be made cer tain and definite. With reference to the details of the revenue law, the Secretary of tire Treasury and Commissioner of Internal Revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amendments necessary or desirable in connection with the administra tion of the law—recommendations which have my approval and sup port. It is of tire utmost importance that in dealing with (his matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the cal endar year 1920, payable in the cal endar year 1921. The Congres might well consider whether the higher rate of income and profits taxes can in peace times be effect ively productive of revenue, and whether they may not. on the con trary. lie destructive of business ac tivity and productive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point al which in peace times high rates ol income and profits taxes discourage energy, remove the incentive to new expenditure and produce industrial stagnation, with consequent unem ployment and other attendant evils Not an Kasy Problem The problem is not an easy one A fundamental change has taker place with reference to the positior of America in the world's affairs. Th( prejudice and passions engendered by decades of controversy betweer two schools of political and eco nomic thought—Hie one believers i> protection of American industries the other believers in tariff for rev enue only—must be subordinated t< the single consideration of the pub lie interest in the light of utterl: changed conditions.
