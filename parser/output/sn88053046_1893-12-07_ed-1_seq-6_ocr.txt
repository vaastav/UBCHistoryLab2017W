Opinions expressed upon this basis are apt to bo but a refiex of general party feeling, and consequently or small value as an index of the popularity of the message.

The treatment accorded the financial question was also disappointingly gen eral, and the reference to the iucomc tax in advance of tho action of tho commit ways and means w only surprise in the message, which has come to be looked upon budget of live news. only find and ble and the country is to the nature of the side The du the *7"" the and the the du P.

REGARDED AS Nevertheless this particular message as generally regarded by the Demo able State document calculated to secure the united support of the party for the President, ■while, of course, the Republicans took issue with him i portant statements, aud particularly nounced his utterances on tho tariff. Some of the views of prominent legis lators are set out as follows : 

ABLE DOCUMENT. crat8 as being of the most im de CHAIRMAN WILSON. Mr. Wilson, D. (W. Va.), chairman of th6 ways and means committee : "I consider it a very fair and business-like review of all the public questions on ■which the President is called upon to address tbe people of the country, am especially pleased at what he says on the tariff question. Mil. m'creary. "An able and appropriate message," ■was the comment of Mr. McCreary, D., (Ky.), chairman ot the House foreign affairs committee. "It contains much valuable information. He presents for eign affairs, the monetary question and tho tariff with great ability. I regard — the message as one of the strongest he sent to the House of Repre sentatives. Ilis utterances on the Ha waiian question are not persons expected, but I have confidence in his judgment and ability, and hope for a satisfactory adjustment of the Ha waiian affairs." !. i : fall ■: MR. 

BYNUM. Mr. Bynum, D., (Ind.)—"It is a very concise but clear statement of the multi tude of questions which Congress will bo called on to consider. While I would like to read some parts of it before dis cussing them, the principal issues pre sented meet my unqualified approval. 1 am specially pleased with the section referring to the tariff, and thecourgeous manner in which the President comes to the support of the ways aud means committee. The reformation of tiie tariff iB a great task, and cannot bo easily accomplished without the support of the administration." 

EX-SPEAKER REED. Ex-Speaker Reed, R., (Maine): "I dislike to comment on tho message, be cause it would not be seemly to do it in adequate terms. It is exceedingly dis appointing both iu matter and muuner. It is largely uiade up of a weurisomo resume of the reports of tho secretaries, which have hardly been improved by condensation. On the Hawaii tion ever, and must wait the uews of the next steamer, just waiting so long. That part of the mes sage which relates to the tariff is most surprising. It .asseverates that the House committee iu charge of that sub ject has formulated plans aud devised methods of tu.xutiou, which, us a ber of the committee, I have never heard proposed. It is a rather unusual sensation to learn of tiie deeds of the committee not m the committee room, but from the President of tho United Sta'-es. Has that committee ceased, even iu form, to be composed of both parties, and has it, without oven the formality of a word in open committee, informed the President of its determination iu such way that the President can offi cially communicate it to the House." que» much in the dark as •e have been MR. m'i* "It is excellent all through," said Mr. McPherson (N.

HILL. Mr. HUI, D., (N. Y.), also declined to discuss the utterances of the President, but gave no reasons for such declination. ITICISMS. BEIM Republican criticisms «m the message are numerous. Democratic express of approval are, for the most pa pressed iu genoral phrases 5\ entering into specific details, and so the hostile forces for the time seem to make the strongest attack on the public ear. Representative H. K. Johnson (Ind.), a Republican member of tiie committee on banking und currency, says of the financial parts of the message: "A dead silence is maintained on the pen«ling before the banking and currency to Statu bank circulation, proposition committee repeal the tax and which is being advocated by many Democratic Cougr subject upon which, because Importance, there pnety, have beeu some exprès do-nothing policy tion is mentioned, . T : its great gilt, with pro . A the iff^ney ques , but the recommenda tion that power Lie gfteu for thu issue of bonds ami the indifferent treatment of international monetary ''uoference. clearly indicate tUe real policy the President favori." Mr. S. E. Payne (N. Y.), Republican member of the wava and means mittee, said : "The " minority members of tlie ways and means committee have had no information as to the plan of the majority members for internal taxation. The statement by the President that the income of corpo rations are to be taxed is original to us. Now thut tiie President has told us what should bo done in reference to internal revenue taxation, l suppose the committee will adopt his plan." Mr. Grosvenor K. (O.) said the tariff is the only aliirmative portion of the message, and it is thoroughly on the lino of the Chicago platform. The President's defiance of public opiuion is in the tiuture of Résolut!) C. 15. Tho adopted of just and Sunday worth Unions, city, ferred, Wir eugaging has the und rev i elation Christi com appeal to Demo s not to be alarmed at the results of the rcceut elections. It can hardly be lertaiued whether he approves the full or not, but he endorses the radical features. llis upology to soldiers for the action of the becretary of tho Interior sufficient them. The message falls away short of exhibit ing the originality mid ability of Mr. Cleveland's for bill comes too lato and gives reason for tho attack made bers to sisters can be it ments messages. 

SOME DEMOCRATIC COMMENT. Mr. Pattcrsou, D. (Tenu.), said: "It is a comprehensive message and gives tho country a summary of the condition of the government and all its depart ments. it is sound and practical. He is eminently sound on the tariff." Mr. Tracy, D. (N. Y.): "1 am satis fied with it—it is a very good message." Mr. Black, D. (111.): "The message long, so indistinctly and hur riedly road that I cannot now criticize it, so important is the documeut." the work tions will the d eligible the taking name name and ' CAN NOT STRIKE A I1ALANOE. Efforts obtain express!« leading Democratic members of both Senate and House were generally met by appeals for further ti the message. Thus it happened that to consider only those predisposed to criticize aud find fault wore ready to be interviewed, and it was, therefore, found impractica ble to strike a balance of sentiment in message, with only akc immediate protnul the Congre side willing to gatiou of their views. the o WEDDING BELLS.

WILMINGTON PORTRAITS Adoi «tory Hoof» of New York, Virginia and Other Neighboring Slat til« COUNC People have no doubt often wondered what has become of the thousands of gatives remaining in photog raphers' hands. The quantities that ac cumulate in a few years amount in weight to many tons of glass. They take up so much room that the photog rapher at length, after 10 or 12 years' storing of the negatives finds it neces sary to dispose of them any way he can. turned up, just in the nick of time, and he is the builder of conservatory sashes. It seems that the soft gray tone of the negutive is the exact medium of light needed by the people who make a business of rais ing hot-house plants. No other glass suits him so weil for various reasons as the old photographic negative. several years the representative of a big New York manufactory has beeu visiting Wilmington and buying up all the old negatives. Sometimes thoy leave with several tons of glass. Last week 12,000 negatives, varying iu ago from 23 to 5 years were sent from A. P. BeecTier's studio, No. 315 Market street, to New York city. It is understood that the manufacturer the negatives for his couserva sell them cheaper than it would cost others to manufacture the sash alone. This is largely through the fact of the cheapness with which he ob tains the cargo of old negatives. It is an odd idea to think that In an accidental visit to an obscure conserva tory in lower Virginia one may recog nize the negative of an old friend beam ing down on roses, carnations and ferns. As there are at least 300 photographers in Philadelphia alone, the extent of the business and tho probabilities of wide* diffusion of portraits may be imagined. : Someone else has F A who tory sashes : Death uf John II.

Hour the McKinley Oy Envoi*««! the Large Dealers. Editor Gazette : As read tho article in the Morning News Wednesday, I would beg space to ask why the writer of the article in regnrd to tho cigar trade did not start to write up his letters before tho passage of the McKinley bill, f »r he seems to be some, what acquainted with the trade. I agree with him in regard to making such a change as he states is proposed, for it would be far worse than it is at present to make any reduction on the import duties of foreign cigars, oven if tho duties of Sumatra wrappers are reduced; but let me ask the writer if ho was acquainted with the trade before the passage of the McKinley bill V If so, does he know tho loss caused not only to the workmen but to all small manu facturers by tho passage of that bill, and bow many thousands of dollars wero made by the leaf dealers of the United States who asked to have tho bill passed ? 1 don't think the petitions sent to Washington will show that way, but let us go back to beforo the passage of the McKinley tariff. The duty on Sumatra loaf war 35 cents per pound. The leaf dealers sent a petition to have it raised and it was raised to $2 per pound. Where docs the money man come in V As soo% as it was a settled fact that tho duty was going on, Sumatra was shipped into the country its fast as they could buy it, and they only paid the duty of 35 cents per pound op it. As soon as the duty went up to $2 they dvanced tho difference which was only per pound. Now suppose' the wriier had bought about 100,000 pounds what would his protits be after the rise? But the small dealer could not import bis tobacco beforo the rise, so he had to buy from those who did, and the dealers would not pay more for their goods, the manufacturer, to retain his profits, had to reduce wages or not hold his trade, since the consumer demands a9 good a cigar as the large manufacturers furnish, and the large manufac turers had tuo money to import Sumatra and get the benefit of the rise. Now they arc satisfied for a reduction and hope for the Republicans to again get in power and raise it again; byt, 5 tho Eem writer wishes to help the work men let him say give us free tobacco and higher duly on imported cigars. When that time comes, if he wishes to know what the McKinley bill ha9 done I will take them and show them. Experience. havln of of ing, the talk The and of of 3 the 1,00 It

The story is takou from the one of the new books of Wilmington Institute Library. Upon it and the~ iiead of Librarian Tyler the responsibility, of course lies.« 'The inci dent, which is found in a passage in the story of a European lady whose forced residence in India gave her abundant opportunity of observation of men and things, is told in thorough seriousness. The lady in question went out one more ing to see the new cow her hus band had just purchased for the daily milk needs of the household. At the eud of the cowpound, or, as we call it hero tho yard, she found the animal standing in a shed. Back in the recesses of tho structure was what dimly looked like a calf. Tiie cow resented tho lady's presence, and but for the rope with which it was tutherçd, would probably linve made tbe lady regret tho visit. Tuo writer goes on to say : "This was partly on account of the calf which stood a little way off, but well within the maternal vision, and it was quite an unreasonable demonstra tion, as the calf was stuffed, and put there to act upon the' cow's imagina tion only. This is a necessary expedient to ensure milk in India from a cow that has no calf of her own. It is a painful imposition, but one that is uniformly successlul."
