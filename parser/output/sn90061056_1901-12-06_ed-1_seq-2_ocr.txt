Ilia po luteal otipononta were the flrat to bear tha heartiest and moat genernu tribute to the broad kindliness ut nature, the weetnes and genllcne o( character which ao endeared him to hla cloaa asso ciate. To etundard of lofty Integrity In public life he united the tender afTee. llona and homo virtue which are all Important In th makeup of national character, A gallant aotdier In the great wnr for the union, ha alau shoti aa an exempt to all our people because of hla conduct In the moat eucred and Intimate of homo relatione. There rould be no personal haired of him, fnr he never act ed with aught hut ronalderntlon for the welfare or other. No one rould fall to respect him who knew him In public or prltate life. The defender of those mur cttrou criminal who aeek to excuse their rrlmlnnllly by aaavrllng that It la excr clued for political end Inveigh agalnat wmllh and Irresponsible power. Hut for thla aasaaalnatlon even thla hue apology cannot be urged,' The alioc k, the grltf of the country, are Mller In the mind of all who saw the dark it ay a while the prraldent yet hovered tetweeri life and death. At lat the light wna a tilled In Ihe kindly eye, end the brralli went from the lipa that even In mortal agony uttered no word aav of forgiven to hla murderer, of loe for hie frlrnda and or iinraltvrlng trust In the will or the Moat High. Huch a death crowning the glory of aurh a life leave ua with Infinite aorrow, but with audi Rrlde In what ho had accomplished and in la own personal character that we feet the blow not aa atruck at him, but as atrurk at the nation. We mourn a good and great prraldent whn la dead, but while wn mount we are lifted up by the eideiidld achievement of his life and the grand heroism with which he mat hla death." In Ihe aame connection he make atrong recommendation aa to how th nation ahould deal wllh anarchy, urge that th preaching or teaching of nnrrhy te not permit!-), and request (ongrea to enact legislation that will rrttent anarchlsta from foreign countrlea tiding upon our ahorra. He would also have the federal court given Jurisdiction over any man who kllla, or attempts to hill, the president nt the country, or any Jierenn who la In line for aurceaslnn lo he presidency. He has no fear, howsver, that the country will ever fait Into an arrhy. "The federal rourta ahoutd he given Jur isdiction otcr any man who kill or at tempt to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law Is in line of aurceealon for the presidency, while the punUhment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to th enormity of tha offense agalnat our In atltutlon. Anarchy la a erlme against th whole human race, and all mankind ahould band against the anarchist. Hla crime ahould be made an offense against the law of nation. Ilka piracy and that form of man stealing known aa the alave trade, for It I or far blacker Infamy than either. It ahould be ao dacUrel by treat! among all civilised nowera.
