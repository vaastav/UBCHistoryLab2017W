CHICAGO TEIBDKB.-' Chicago, BL Cljicaga Cribmtc. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10,1803. THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE, For reasons referred to elsewhere, the latter andmore important portion of-the Message came to hand at too late an hour for careful and extended com ments in this issue. Happily there arc few authors of State papers so little in need ot commentators as President Lincoln. He evidently does not believe that language was given toconceal ideas. He uses it as a vehiclebfhis plaint earnest, and honest convictions of duty and views of public policy. After devoting the first half of the Mes aageto the disenssion of usual and ordina ry topics of public business, the President gives a calm and thorough review of the rebellion, what has been done for its ex tin guisbrnent in the past year, and then comes to the important topic of its radical cure, .and the wort of hzookbteuction. This having been discussed in the Message, is formally embodied in the Proclamation which accompanies it The Emancipation Proclamation will be sustained by ail the power of the Govern ment Mo slave freed under its provisions ■will be reduced again to servitude. The President holds out the olive branch to the main body of the rebels, excepting only from amnesty and pardon, the more guilty of the conspirators. He wisely places our main present reliance on the sword. Those only can return to allegiance who me able to do so under the protection of our militaiy power. The tender shoots of loyalty cannot put forth where the rigors of rebel rule are as yet unbroken. We must occupy, overshadow and protect all The solution thence on ward is prepared for. The Message of Gov- Pierpont, of Virginia, comes happily in to sustain the position of the President, which is, only to accept and be guided by the votes and action of loyal men, and leave out of the question the disloyal, though they be in the majority. Thus the President fixes the limit at one-tenth of the vote of the returning State, and such share of its inhabitants ram, in due fonn prescribed by the Constitution, re assnme fealty to the Government and the relations sundered by the rebellion. The President does not hesitate to avow ' that the whole question is an open one and without precedent for guidance, but his enunciation of the principles underlying the inevitable settlement will be hailed by nil loyal men, and deepen the conviction that one to whom such duties and responsi bilities are entrusted, whose grasp of the subjects vital to oy na tional existence is so calm, statesmanlike and patriotic, is not lightly to be replaced by a 'fresh- and untried helmsman. The work he has begun and thus far carried for ward, should remain in his hands for com pletion, a completion that shall bring back Peace under Liberty, and Union perpetual because without an element of discord.

NEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE. The evening conservative organ of this city drew an elephant yesterday in the shape of the President’s Message. This document usually costs the press of this city for telegraphic transmission from SIOO 'to S2OO. The Journal, more greedy tb*m ‘discreet, hastened to bespeak it entire for its evening edition, though it should have been warned hy its past ill success in deal ing with bulky telegraphic matter its limited facilities for handlings the some having been repeatedly betrayed by abbreviated and bungled news. The Message commenced being received by telegraph at 1 o'clock a. m. The few cozn •positora of the Journal fell at work upon it and succeeded in getting a petty afnstal ment in type for its first edition, only a lit tle more for its 5 o'clock edition, and then ran completely out of sorts and came to a stand still. Notwithstanding that the Mes sage was in type in several other cities in the West before G o'clock, the Journal was forced to stop short and found itself with a heavy hill (for them) for matter it could not use. The organ of Jeff. Davis came to their relief, and bought out the distressed eve ning organ, assuming a share of its bill with the stipulation between the conspira tors that the Times of thia morning should thus publish the only complete copy of the Message. How well this scheme carried our readers will discover, and they are thus infojmcd why the evening paper in three editions failed to publish the Message. They could not do it They had neither the type or the facilities for. the prompt handling of a dispatch of such length, and were glad to faint away into the arms of the morning sccesh organ, who caught up the fragments and pays the whole bllL It will probably he some time before the frog on Dearborn street attempts to swallow an ox's rations. Wc arc indebted to the Springfield (Dls.) Journal for a telegraphic dispatch furnishing ns with the portions of the Message and Proclamation of which the Journal defrauded its own-readers and sought lo deprive its neighbors. 

EAST TENNESSEE. The reasons why the President gives such prominence to our successes in East Ten nessee, arc not perhaps so well known to nil of us as to him; but there arc some so eminently worthy of special mention, that they can hardly be overlooked by any. It is Past Tennessee which' commands the grcat’raOroad connecting* the meat and grain producing portion of that State and North Carolina with Richmond. It is to this section that the rebels look for the main supplies fbr their Virginia army, and its final loss is a blow almost fatal to their cause. The devoted and enduring loyalty of the people in this mountain region also give them especial claims on the relief and pro tection of the country. The privations, suf ferings and the cruelties which have been caused or perpetrated in their midst by the rebels, moke one of the bloodiest pages in the record of the war; and it is a matter of great congratulation that the hoar of their triumph has at lastoome, and the outrages and wrongs they have endured ore, by our late victories, brought to a dose, we trust forever. These, if there wereno others, would be reasons enough why all loyal people should respond to the request of our good Presi dent, andretum praise and thanks to Heav en for these among its other fnwitblPsrfnmL c®" B ° mc **** “SO. the residence, at Washington, of the famous Dr. Garnett, son in-law of Wise, the man who colled upon thousands of Virginians to help in the hang.

Whebeas, In and by the Constitution of the United States, it is provided that the President shall have power to grantreprieves . and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment, and Wzxsbeas, A rebellion now exists whereby the loyal States and the government of the several States have for a long time been sub verted, and many persons have committed, and are now guilty of treason against the United States; Whebeas, With reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by the Congress, calling for the forfeiture and con fiscation of property and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein sta ted; and also, declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any time there after, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion, in-any State or part thereof; par don andlamhesty, with such exceptions and on sufh trims and of such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare and Whereas, The congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well established judicial expositions of the pardoning power; and whereas, with refer ence to said rebellion, the President of the United States has issued several proclama tions, with provisions in regard to the libera tion of slaves; and. Whereas, It is now desired by some per sons heretofore engaged in the rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States, and reinangurate loyal State Governments within and for their respective States, Therefore, I Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have directly, or by implication, participated In the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardok is grafted to them, and each of them, with restoration of all rights, if third parties shall have inter vened, and upon the condition that they, such persons, shall take and subscribe an oath, and thenceforward keep and main tain said' oath Inviolate, and which bath will be registered for permanent preservation, and shall bo of the tenor and effect following ~ to-wit: 

TSBOATH. I do solemnly swear, in the presence of Almighty God, that 1 win henceforth faithfully support, pro tect and defend the Constitution of the United States and the union of States hereafter, and that J trill in like manner abide by and faithfully gap port aHacts of Congress passed during the exist ing rebellion, with reference to Blares, so long and so far as repealed, modified or held void by Con gress, or by decision of the Supreme Court, and that I win in like manner abide by, and faithfully support, all proclamations of the President made during the existing rebellion haring reference to slares, so long and so far as not madlflaa or declar ed rold by decisions of the Supreme Court, so help me God. The persons excepted from, the benefits of the foregoing provisions, are: -1, All whoarobrhavebecn civil or diplomatic officers, or agents of the so-called Confederate Government. -- • 2. All who have left Judicial stations under the United Stases, to aid the rebellion. * 3. All who are, or shall have been, military or naval officers of the rank of Colonel is the army, or lieutenant in the navy. 4. AUwho-left Beats is the United States Con gress, to aid in the rebellion.’ C. All who have engaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in charge of. such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may be found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity. Ido farther proclaim, declare and make _ known, let That whenever In any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than one-tenth of the num ber of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord 1800, cadi having taken the oath aforesaid, am id not having since violated, it, and being a qualified voter by the Haws of the State, ex isting immediately before the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall establish a State Government, "which shall be republican, and in no wise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true Government of the State, and the United States «bnii receive them under the benefit of the constitutional pro visions which declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State In the Union a republican form of government, and shall! protect each of them from invasion, and on application of the Legislature, or the Execu-. live when the Legislature cannot be con vened, against domestic violence. * Secoitd—l do further proclaim, declare and make known, that any provision which may be adopted by such State Government, in relation to the freed people of such State which shall recognize and declare, their per manent freedom, and provide for their educa tion, and which may yet he consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present! condition as a laboring, landless and home less class, will not be objected to by the na tional Executive, and it Is suggested as not! improper that in the construction of a loyal' State Government in any State, the state Of the boundary, the subdivisions, the Constitu tion and the Federal code of laws, as before the rebellion, be maintained subject only to modification, made necessary by the con-! ditions herein before stated, and such others,' if any, not contravening such conditions, which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new State Government. To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, bo far as it relates to State governments, has no ref erence to States wherein .loyal State govern ments have all the while been maintained; and for the same reason it may be proper to say that, whether members sent to Congress from any State shall he admitted to seats, conventionally rests exclusively with the respective [Houses, and not to any extent with ‘the Executive, and still farther, that the proclamation is intended to present to the people of the States wherein the national authority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been subverted, a mode by which the national authority over every loyal Stategov eminent, may be established within said States, or any of them, and while the mode presented is the best the Executive can sug gest, with his present impressions, It mast not be understood that another possible mode would not be accepted.

FROM WASHIN6TON. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Washikoiox, Dec, 9, 1863. The first reception of the President’s mes sage was quite favorable; as they began to scan it more closely, the radical wing of the Administration party became more cautions in their praise. It is regarded as effectually settling Montgomery Blair’s claim to hare •spoken for the President In his Rockville speech, but, nevertheless, Blair is said to express satisfaction with it. It does not endorse Sumner’s views on reconstruc tion, yet the friends of the latter claim that it substantially includes and embodies them. Th* practical point of the whole message is with the idea that absolute and complete emancipation must attend and be the basis of reconstruction. The.proclamation in itself is supposed to be of but little avail without important Congressional legislation. If Con gress takes np the question at all, therefore the subject of reconstruction must form a large clement in this winter’s debates, not withstanding the efforts which have been made to stave it oft It now seems while Chase’s Mozart speech did not exactlyindicate Mr. Lincoln’s views, It come nearer foreshadowing his policy than any other utterance, either from Cabinet Ministers or others. Mr. 'Lincoln’s friends claim that the message will prove one of the most popular state papers ever penned. The Democrats on the other hand call It a conning trap, smacking rather of the attorney than the statesman, and deny that it origin led with Mm; besides intense radicals ex press something of the same opinion in say ing that it owes its apparent popularity to its avoidance of points on which he knew that anything he would say would mouse differences among his supporters. It is stated that the Secretary of the Trea sury has not called for any authority to issue any more greenbacks, but will depend entire ly upon long bonds for what money will be needed. The only issues recommended will be to replace the defaced and mutilated notes already authorized to be put in circulation. The Treasurer’s estimates and appropria tions ore, for the army and nary, $699,502,- 787. The balance is between this amount and $801,815,088. The. total estimates will be required for the civil service. Newspaper men in Washington propose some evening next week to give a compli mentary dinner to Schuler Colfax, who is the first of professional Journalists ever elec-, ted to the. Speakership of the American House of Representatives. Congressman Blair, of Mo., has a letter from Eli Thayer, referring to Goj. Gamble’s recommendation of on appropriation to in duce immigration into that State. • Thayer says he is preparing for organized efforts to direct emigration Southward, as the war opens the country up, and is ready now to go to work in Missouri- He thinks that with proper co-operation, he could put 50,000 emigrants In Missouri in 1864. • The. Commissioner of the General Land Office has determined that whenpre-emptors hayo'failed to make good their pre-omptlon their land is not subject to entry under the homestead act. The Immigration- Bureau statistics show that the total emigration in forty years pre vious to 1860 has been 5,062,514. Previous to 1800 it was 234,000, and since 1800, 850,000, making 5,040,415, since 1790. At SBO each, the'capital brought into the country by these emigrants has been $494,000,000. Gov. Pierpont of East Virginia, has just issued his message from Alexandria. It goes into the Justification of his Government as the rightful advocates, also freeing all the slaves in the State. The standing committees of the House arc not to be announced before Monday. The pressure for more officers is tremendous. Senator Henderson will, after the forma tion of the committees, go into the Adminis tration canons. WAsnuroToy, Dec.'9.—The Treasury De partment this morning received information by telegraph from an offleer of the revenue, at Portland,* of the recent seizure of the steamer Chesapeake. The State and Navy Departments “_V-at once mode acquainted with the fact The Treasury immediately telegraphed. to Col lector Barney to send a revenue cutter in pursuit of the pirates, but before the message reached him a telegram was received that he had already dispatched the Miami on that business. The State Department telegraphed to onr Consul at St Johns to detain the Chesapeake should she arrive there; and the Navy De partment telegraphed Commander Bhind, at Portland, to take on board light artillery and a detachment of soldiers from the authori ties, and go out in pursuit of the Chesapeake In the U. 8. steamer Agawam.

The Secretary then discusses,' at some Icngth/thc improvements in naval vessels. After speaking of the wonderful revolution that has taken place In naval architecture since tho war broke out, he proceeds as fol lows: The Monitor class of armed ships with revolv ing turrets, and four guns of heavy calibre, has proved itself well adapted for harbor defense, and coast survey In some emergencies. These vessels from their great powers of endurance, have shown themselves efficient and serviceable in of fensive operations. This form and description of vessel which originated in the inventive genius of Capt John Ernes eon, will perform not only all that should bo expected of them to make our haN bors secure, but when of enlarged capacity, may supersede ships of higher pretensions, to main tain our rightful maritime position and predomi nancy on the ocean. Vessels of greater size than any turret vessel yet completed maybe essential. Not only must they carry guns of a heavier caliber than have heretofore been nsedat sea, but In order to make long cruises and to cope successfully with any force, these vessels must have all possible strength, endurance and speed. Their structure most there fore afford space enough for frill sailing power, and for the most powerful” steam machinery, and the large supplies oWnel needful to keep it at work. Being unlike tho other great marine nations without distant colonics where coal depots can be established on the shore of almost every sea, we must conform to the necessities of onr condition and build ships with capacity enough to take on board ftxel sufficient for long anises. The space for other supplies for muni tions of war, for the accommodation of officers and crew, should also he ample, and In addition to this cacbof these vessels must, in order to accom plish its work, present in its construction armor, armament and propulsion all the power that the resources of modern invention and mechanical science and art can furnish for attack, resistance and pursuit, A vessel of this description mast, of course, cost a large price: but then wise statesmanship will not fall to perceive that possession of even very few such unconquerable ships must, while vastly augmenting the force and renown of onr navy, afford ns at tho same time inestimable guarantee of peace with na tions. Nor, counting the cost of such floating structures can wo forget that large as that coat may he, it yet sinks Into Insignificance in con trast with expenditures and sacrifices of a single year, or even amounts of foreign war. In ora*r that we may hare at onr command a navy which shall fulfill these unexampled and exacting condi tions of efficiency, a commensurate public estab lishment for Its construction and preparation is indispensable, for a navy carried on a large scale, and in every respect of a new plan, amply furnish ed with all the proper facilities and aids for its operations where machinery for steamers can be manufactured. Iron vessels' constructed; made and tested, and repairs of every description executed, is an absolute necessity. In view of these facts, I Itad the honor on successive occa sions to urge this matter upon the attention of the last Congress, and tho omissfon of that body of such establishment is a misfortune which the country is now made to feel. Vessels frequently need repairs, and as onr pub lic yards are entirely inadequate for the manufac ture and repair of steam machinery, great delay ana loss of military opportunities have occurred, attended with vast loss of money. . . a l n \ t^e^ore > mo9 t earnestly Invoke the at tention of Congress to the manifest and Inauspi cious fact that our Government has made no suffi cient provision in its pnbllc establishments for tho existing requirements of naval warfare. Our conn try is better prepared for this change than almost any other maritime nation, for we have but few sailing vessels of large class, and these few, to which steam cannot be applied, may be used to advantage for other than fighting purposes. • The disadvantages of wooden vessels are, want of strength as compared with those of iron struc ture, and the mortvrapid decay of the material, par ticularly when covered with iron plating the action of tho immersed Iron armor or copper shearing near it causing the copper to become foul and the plates to waste. The difficulty of keening vessels tight under armor plates, and tho probability of greater strength of Iron permits the construction of ships of greater size and liner lines, and having greater internal capacity. They can be af any time Inspected In all their parts, are safe from fire, and arc better pro tectedfrom great leaks, as they can have water tight compartments. Their repairs r*n generally be more easily made, and from tbeir great dura bility. thev are probably in the end, not more cost ly.' An iron vessel, moreover, can he taken from the water and placed on land for preservation, which, cannot be done with wooden vessels. The disadvantages of iron Teasels arc the serious local weakness or the thin plates composing the bottom of en iron ship, the danger that would re sult from gcttinc on rocks or-submerged: obstruc tions, their liability to rapidly become foul in salt water, whereby their speed becomes greatly im paired, their requiring to be frequently docked for cleaning, the great danger from a snot stri king below the armor plating as they roll; the the injury caused by the splinters of Iron when the plates are broken or smashed; the corrosion inside irem bilge water; the difficulty In making tempo rary repairs of shot holes, ana the limited numner ofartisansyettobe procured having skill In this ■description of employment. It is believed that tho troops at every point have been supplied with an abundance of wholesome food,'and that If in the move ment of the armies temporary want has been felt, it has not been dne to any want of fore sight or attention on the part of the Commis sary General's Department The Paymasters report, and the Acting Surgeon General’s* report, with' full details are also given. * A compliment Is paid to the military tele graph and the valuable services' It has ren dered to the Government, under the superin tendence of CoL Stager and Major Eckert Alter alluding to some claims against that department, saying that further legislation or a larger appropriation will be required to carry them into effect, he concludes as fol lows; “I may be permitted to express the hope that the next annual report from this Department- may announce the complete overthrow of the rebellion and restoration of peace, and the establishment of tho Union on a sure foundation in all the bounds of the United States. 

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR a New Yore Dec. B.—The report of the Sec retary of War is of considerable length. It reviews our victories and pays high tribute to the bravery and skill of our troops. Ho says the combined operations of oar army and navy against Charleston have nol yet accomplished what was expected of them. In Texas a large force operating under Bonks, will give protection to the people of that State, and cut off a chief avenue of the rebels for foreign commerce and foreign aid. The armies of Leo and Meade now occnpy relatively the same positions as they did at the* date of the last aimnni report • West Virginia is now, clear of rebels and the people of that State are enjoying in com parative peace, the blessings of civil govern ment The rebel forces in Missoni! have been driven beyond the Arkansas river, No mllltaiy operations of any magnitude have taken place in Virginia or North Caro lina. The Federal force* are now planted Jlruihj in every rcW State. The success of our armies during the past year has enabled the Department to make a reduction of over 8200,000,000 in the esti mates for the ensuing year. " trouble in regard to the exchange of prisoners is reviewed at length, and the blame for the non*oxchange thrown entirely upon the rebel authorities. He alludes to the good treatment the rebel prisoners have received at one bands; and denounces the rebel authorities for the cruel manner in which they have treated our pris oners in their hands. He then discusses the act of Congress for enrolling and calling out • the national forces, and says that the law hns been enforced in twelve States, yielding 50.000 soldiers and $10,000,000 for procuring substitutes. <■* The 8800 clause is adduded to, as are also the conflicting opinion in regard to its justice and injustice. He says that a large proper tlon of the troops whose terms expire next year, will re-cnlst, It being stipulated by the Government that they shall have at least one month furlough before their present term ex pires. The indications arc that the force required will in a great measure be raised by volun teering, and without a draft. An immediate appropriation for bounties - should bemade. He then alludes to the valuable service the invalid corps has rendered to the Govern ment The corps now numbers 90,000, offi cers and privates. He says, immediately after the issue of the President’s proclamation, diligent efforts were commenced, and have continued until the present time, for raising colored troops. Fifty thousand colored men are now organ ized, and the number will rapidly increase as our armies advance. The freed slaves mako 

CHICAGO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1863. good soldiers, arc easily disciplined, and arc full of courage. The slave has proved his manhood and capacity, and makes a good in fantry, artillery or cavalry soldier, as has been evidenced on several occasions. The colored troops have been allowed no bounties under the construction given by the Department They can only, by the existing law, receive $lO per month for their services, while white soldiers receive sl3, with clothing and daily rations. The fortunes of war have brought within our lines Luge numbers of colored women and children, and some aged and infirm per sons. A solemn trust rests upon the govern ment for their care and protection. The Adjutant General recommends that the term of enlistment in the regular service be fixed at three years instead of five, In accord ance with the act of 1833, which expires by limitation on the Ist of January, 1861. The Secretary gives a list of the principal ordnance materials in tbc control of the De partment at the beginning of the war, &<*., and the quantities of these articles which have since been procured, and the quantities of these articles on hand June 30th, 1863. The figures are immense. The operations of*the Chief Engineer con nected with the survey of the Northern and Northwestern lakes have been continued, and during thopast season have consisted in the surrey of Portage Entry* on Lake Superior, ?°r “resuming the survey of Green Bay and Lake Michigan; also the examinations of the channels of the St Clair Flats and of St George; also of St Mary's river.

As there arc, doubtless, many citizens of the classes contcmplttcd by the statute who are in the military arid naval service of the United States, and' consequently unable to do the personal acts at the district lond : office which the law requires, -remedial legislation Is recommended,-Whereby the wife or.rcpre eentative of any such party shall have the right to take the requisite preliminary steps, with a view to give legal inception to a home stead claim in behalf of the principal, who < may be in the land or naval service of the United States. It is further submitted, that the homestead act bo so amended that parties entering lands under its provisions shall pay the full com missions of the register and receiver, when the entry is made, instead of paying/as re quired by the statute, only one-half of said commissions at time of entry, the balance having to be paid when the final certificate Is Issued, at the end of five years.

Washington, Dec. o. —The Legislature of Vinrfnla completed its organization to-day at Alexandria. Gov. Plerpont’s Message was delivered to both houses. It contains an. argument against secession, and andtber in favor of the eman cipation of all the slaves in the State, with a recommendation that the Legislature shall call a convention of the people to secure the alterations of the Constitution to that end. In answer to the assertion that a majority of the people of the State were rebels, he urges that felons and paupers have no right to vote , nor have rebels. They can’t deprive the loyal citizens of their rights, if the loyal citizens can assert their rights; and he con* tends that no connties of the State should hereafter be allowed a representative in the State Government until they are organized by the election of officers by whom taxes can be collected. In his argument upon the slavery question, he says the President’s Proclamation frees oil in the State except in a few counties. Without ibis amendment to the Constitn- tlon, I foresee endless strife and tunnolL All the State officers are sworn to anpport the Constitution of the Ignited States -and laws of Virginia. The laws of the State, as they now stand, recognize slavery. The officers will be called upon forwarrants to apprehend slaves and commit them to jail. The army of the United States will interpose, thns a conflict will ensne, and the rebels glory in the strife. tr We must cither decide to come into antag onism with the United States or alter our organic law on the subject The Governor says he has reliable informa tion from a large portion of the State that as scon as the domestic violence is suppressed, there will be more than enough of capable men, who have never bowed to secession, to welcome and carry on the government of the State and that of every county.
