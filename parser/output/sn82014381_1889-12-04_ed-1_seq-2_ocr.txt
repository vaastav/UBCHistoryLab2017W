The message of President Harrison ii a very long »nd an able state paper. It length should not prevent any citizen who feels a sincere interest in the affairs of the nation from reading it slowly, carefully and in full. It fairly and exhaustively places before the people the condition of their country and the affairs of the several departments of the national Government. It will take rank among the plainest, clearest and most conscientious of state papers. It is not a great document in the sense that literary brilliancy and politi cal adroitness and fencing, make a state paper remarkable. But it is a message that does honor to the heart of the Pres ident, and testifies to his courage of con viction, the sincerity of his purpose and his patriotic devotion. It is straightfor ward, strong and unmistakable. He does not hesitate to antagonize the silver men, and to point out why he op poses the free coinage of silver. He does not hesitate to declare that the duty of the nation to itself, the claims of common justice and the calls of humanity demand that the black man in the South shall be accorded his full civil rights; that the suppression of his vote shall cease, and that the political towering of the ex-slave shall be brought to a speedy end. He has the courage, also, to protest against the at tempt to drive the black man from his home, and to deprive the South of its chief labor element. He has the courage, fur ther, to speak his mind in unmistakable terms concerning the pensioning of ex soldiers of the late war, and to insist that those who served well and long, and were discharged without disability, but have since become dependent upon their labor for support, but by disease not due to vice, or by accident or age are unable to support themselves, shall be provided for by the Government for which they periled their lives, and be prevented from be coming dependents upon private charity. The President has also the courage to denounce as unfit for the privileges of American citizenship all classes of people who assume obligations antagonistic to social order, in opposition to the laws and their execution, and who are at enmity •with the form of government under which we live —not only would he refuse all such the benefits of the naturalization laws, but he would deny them domicile in the coun try. He quietly but forcibly rebukes civi service radicals who have lately assailed the Administration on the ground that it has proved untrue to the civil service re form laws; he points out the defects of those laws and advises legislation to ex tend and improve them, to render the civil service more efficient, and to remove it more and more from political control. The Democracy will probably assail the message on the ground that it is inconsist ent with Republican pledges in advising reduction in the tariff schedules; but the President has been careful to reassert the protective doctrine to which he pledged himself in the late campaign, and he points out that limitation of inceme to the needs of the Government need not trespass upon the doctrine of the protec tion of home industries. He makes a long and fervent plea for the extension of such governmental aid to ocean mail carry ing lines as will stimulate the reassertion of a prominent position for the flag upon the commercial high seas, and will give us a fair share of trade through the ave nues of a strong merchant marine, bearing the colors of the nation upon all seas and into all ports. He reasserts the wisdom of the Chinese Restriction Act, points out how it is evaded upon the British Colum bian border, and asks Congress to author ize the Treasury Department to employ sufficient force to check the invasion iv that direction, and that steps be taken to bring about an understanding with the Dominion of Canada upon the subject. The demand for the amendment of the naturalization laws so as to insure stricter examination of applicants and the pres ence in Court of a representative of the Government to cross-examine all petition ers for citizenship, and to resist the appli cation in proper cases, will find a respons ive echo in every patriotic heart. The suggestion that the internal revenue be greatly reduced by the removal of the tax upon tobacco, and from all spirits used in the arts and manufactures, will provoke anew the debate upon the internal revenue question. The President will probably find himself supported by the majority of the people in that recommendation. The advice that we proceed at once to greatly enlarge our navy and augment our coast defenses will find only feeble opposi tion. The great mass of tlie people will approve and insist that Congress act dur ing the present session upon these import ant subjects with celerity and upon a broad and distinctly stated policy. The Presi dent advises, also, that the United States follow the example ol Great Britain, and in aiding commercial carriers engaged in ocean mail service, stipulate that they shall be so fitted that on demand they may be speedily converted into armed cruisers, and taken int»the service of the nation as a reserve naval force. He advices legisla tion upon the subject of trusts and injuri ous combinations to "corner" the products of the country to the ippression of the people; that the postal service, which comes into more intimate communication jjrith the people than any other branch of the Government, be still more conserved, and that to a greater extent it be brought within the civil service regulations; that Hawaii be invited to a seat in the Interna tional Conference now sitting in Washing ton ; that the policy of the Government that treats with the Indian as an indi vidual and discourages the tribal relation be maintained; that the National Guard b* encouraged, and aided to occupy the coast fortresses from time to time for train ing; «.hat Government aid be given to fur ther th« enlightenment of the black man, who wa: so recently in a condition of slavery, but that such aid shall not be so extended as to destroy the conviction in the States of tVe duty of self-helpfulness; that a National bankrupt law be passed, and that international copyright be fa vored. These are but a portion of the subjects to which the President has ad dressed himself. The examination of the message in detail and vith delilteration must be reserved for other dates. Senator Stanford, it is said, will re mtroduce his bill providing for the en couragement of co-operative industry. It goes no further than to recognize the asso ciation of individuals for the conduct of business and the division of profits, whether there is money capital or not. In other words, it is a wise and a beneficient scheme to aid the capitalization of skill and labor by association. The thought of the scheme is one born of broad views of human possibilities under union of effort, that will return to each the proportion that is his due, for the labor put forth or the skill contributed. The Southern Pacific Company has manifested its desire to further the Citrus Fair interests at Oroville, by announcing that it will carry all goods for exhibit:on there at half rat<"S. Dom Pedro is a sensible man; arriving off the coast of Europe he was at once be set by reporters—he refused to be inter viewed. 

NOTE AND COMMENT. The New Era, published at Benicia. So lano county, has entered upon its thirteenth volume. The most contemptible coward on the f ice of the earth is he who sneaks into print and assails another under a tuna de plume. Such men are always beneath no tice, and no one is ever injured by their attacks. AMUSEMENTS. At the Metropolitan Theater last night a large and representative audience assembled to hear the J. C. Duff Opera Company ia "Paola," a new production by the authors of "Erminie." The opera was well received; it has few airs that will be stored in the memory or be popularized, but the music is graceful, light, brisk, quite melodious and dramatic. The company is a large one and especially strong in comedy element. At one time the stage was crowded by the numbers of the performers. The chorus is efficient, twenty-four female and seventeen male voices giving it strength. The chorus is also admirably trained dra matically, and gave some very handsome groupings. In costumery the company is brilliant, the variety and richness of the dressing being especially fine. Digby Bell, the low comedian, had such a reception as a comic opera singer but seldom receives from a critical assemblage. The audience was enthusiastic in its applause and recalls, and insisted upon repetitions of his topical songs until he entered protests. Very little opportunity was afforded to hear the baritone, Mark Smith, but his ser enade won him commendatory applause. The soprano, Januscbowsky, is best in her upper notes, the middle tones, while sweet, lack strength. Her voice has, however, the sympathetic quality in a marked de gree. Her presence is attractive and her manner upon the stage the shadow of a charming foreign accent, and her naivete made her a favorite from the outset. From tbe auditorium, when singing, her counte nance bears a resemblance to that of Emma Abbott. Kate Gilbert proved to be a plaas ine singer and a capital actress and gave ex cellent support, as also did Pearson and Fay. To Mr. Pierson was given the only bass solo, which proved him to be a capable member. Laura Joyce Bell, the contralto, was heard to advantage but once and was complimented by a hearty encore. Meas ured by her success here some years ago, her voice, while still a pure contralto, was not heard to such advantage and is less strong and clear, but possesses dramatic qualities that make her a valuable addition to the company. In Yon Suppe's comic opera. "A Trip to Africa, 1' to be sung to-night, it is said she has a role with scores more congenial and better adapted to her vocal qualities. The opera this evening also brings the tenor of the company, Mr. Packard, to the front. If the opera this evening is as full of fine humor, genuine wit and keen satire, and keeps an audience in as merry a vein as tbe opera of last night, there will be full compensation for all who attend, since the company is strong in its ability to entertain. The thirty-fourth annual ball and drill of Company A (City Guard) was held last evening at Armory Hall, which was largely attended. After the drill Colonel E. H. McKee, on behalf of Weinstock, Lubin & Co., presented the company with the beautiful trophy recently won by it as the best-drilled company. The company was under the command of Captain Glas. The Bazar of Days, under the auspices of the ladies of the Unitarian Society, was well attended again yesterday at the Pythian Castle. It has been a very pleas ant affair. The box office for the Antiope season opens to-day. Emphatic denial is given by the management to the stories published in San Francisco of secession from the troupe. SUPERIOR COURT.

To whom it may concern: I hare tried almost every conceivable remedy for bilious ness daring the past five years as I am of a bilious temperament and suffer much from ilomach and liver troubles. But nothing ever gave me the relief that I obtained from using Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. In fact I think it a cure for those ailments. At the time I was using it I had a little girl living In my family whose neck was seriously af fected by a large open sore, and we tried a great many kinds of lotions, salves and blood purifiers to no avail. I gave her some of my medicine (Joy's VegetableSarsapariilajthink ing it might benefit her «nd as it was purely vegetable, knew it could do her no harm. To jny astonishment she began to improve, and within two weeks it was entirely healed and the is now as well as ever. Mrs. B. L.

GLADSTONE'S LIBERAL POLICY. The South Atlantic Squadron is An chored at Kiodc Janeiro—All Quiet in Brazil. IKFICLAL DIKPATCHES TO THZ EKCOBD-UNION.I A CRISIS IN SPAIN. It Looks as Though She Will Follow Brazil's Example. Midrid, December 3d.—There is great excite ment throughout Spain over the agitation in favor of a republic that has been growing since the overthrow cf the Brazilian Empire. It has increased to such a degree within a week that an uprising is imminent. A crisis was averted by the Queen Regent agreeing to a modification of the Cabinet to appease the Republicans. This measjre is only regarded as palliative and of temporary effect, for the Republicans continue to meet publicly and urge their cause. At a recent meeeting congratulatory addresses to the Provisional Government of Brazil were adopted also declaring, "We hope to lound a republic in Spain at an eariy date, emulating your example." A dispatch from Vienna says the news from Spain onuses alarm at Vienna, which was the home of Maria Christina before Bhe became Queen of Spain, and who is regarded with deeD affection. .Emperor Francis Joseph is much disturbed over the concessions made the Spanish Republi cans, aud is quottd as saying the Queen's action would hasten a revolution. FEDERATION OF REPUBLICS. Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, San Salvador and Nicaragua. Managua (Nicaragua), November 12th.—Pres ident Saeasa has signed a treaty admitting Ni caragua into the union of the Republics of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, San Salvador and Guatemala, under the name of the United states of Central America, but it Is believed the Nicaraguau GoDgress will reject the measure. The plan of the Union provides that for the first ten years it will simply be an offensive and delensive alliance, and the President of the Union will have charge only of the diplomatic and foreign relation.- (if the live republics. At the expiration of that period the Union will be cemented by the adoption of a i (.institu tion, which will embrace all the political, com mercial and other relations between the five republics and foreign power> A common monetary standard and common tariff laws will be adopted, but there will be free trade between the different republics. Honduras, Guatemala and San Salvador have already signed the treaty, and it is understood Costa Rica will do the same. 

INSPIRED WORDS. Gladstone's Liberal Policy Well Received at Manchester. London, December 3d —At the Manchester meeting to day Gladstone inspired great enthu siasm by his definite exposition of the Liberal policy. He said Ireland is the leading <iue*tlon of the day, and that the Tories would have been converted to tbe Liberal view subject by this time hut for dissenting Liberals. The split In the Liberal party, he said, would not have occurred except lor the gersonal ambition of some Tories and their allies, who desired more to form a national party than to do political justice. He severely arraigned the Unionist leaders on this point, and said the plan of the campaign was a necessary consequence of the Govern ment's refusal to grant proper relief to Ireland. There was, he said, less crime in Ireland than in England. He was of the opinion the country had clearly expressed a desire there should be a change in the administration of Ireland, and the Liberals might look to the future with con fidence. EDglish Expressions on the Message. London, December 3d.—The I'ost says: If Fresident Harrison carries out in practice the peacetul and progressive principles indicated in his message, the whole world will be gainer thereby The Times welcomes the extradition proposal and expresses surprise that the Western States do not revolt against the heavy exactions of taxation imposed for the benefit of the cotton and iron-workers of the Atlantic States. The Standard thinks tariff reform may mean something real a couple of years hence. Half of the present expenditures is mere extrava gance, that can be dispensed with when the people decide to crush the secret of Tammany. Portugal Will Fight. Lisbon, December 3d.—The Government will send a circular letter to European Powers say ing it is ready to proTe unbroken occupation by Portugal of African territories now claimed by England, and, further, it says Portugal is de termined to maintain her possession ol the dis puted territory.

CRIME IN COLORADO. An Old Lady Murdered—A Strange Family. Dznvek (Col.), December 3d.—A horrible dis covery was made here late to-night, which may vet prove to be a tragedy. About a year and a hall ago Mrs. Ritchie, an old gray-haired woman about sixty years of age, came here from Chey enne, Wyo., accompauied by a young man about twenty-five, wuom she represented as hpr son, and a deal and dumb daughter about fif teen. They lived in various parts of the city until about two months ago, when they engaged apartments at 1621 Stout street, where they lived a very retired life. Three weeks ago the mother and son went on a protracted debauch. The old lady had not been seen for several days, and the landlord be coming alarmed broke open the door of her room to-night, and was horrified by finding the woman lying upon the floor by the side of her bed dead, with her face almost devoured by rats. The body was taken to iho Coroner's olUcc, and there will be an investigation to morrow. The son was found In an adjoining room beastly drunk and taken to the Matiou-house, where he now lies, unable to speak or give an account of himself. The dead woman is reported to have 520,000 on deposit in the First National Bank. The family went to Cheyenne from Texas, and while living in Wyoming, a son was mys teriously murdered. It is said that the deaf and dumb daughter knows who committed the crime, but refuses to divulge the secret, and no arrests have been made. Officers' Raid. At 1:30 a. m. to day a squad of eight officers raided the Lafayette saloon and two others in the immediate neighborhood, and arrested thirty tramps, opium fiends and crooks.
