Jfemocratrt Advocate. i WESTMINSTER, MD. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1886. The Eastern Question. The ‘"Eastern Question,” so called, and ‘•the Balance of Power,” have long vexed the countries of Western Europe. They are leading topics in continental politics, but arc seldom presented in a clear and in telligible light on this side the water. The compilers of the news in Europe, fortrans mission to this country by telegraph, usu ally do it in the most confused and bung ling manner, so that, little reliance can he placed on it. We have been accustomed to read, for years, such annnouncements as —“War Imminent,” “Another TV ar Cloud in Europe,” “The Turkish Army Mobilized,” “Active Military Preparations in Russia,” “The Czar Negotiating a War Loan,” “France and Russia in Accord,” “Germany, Austria, Italy, England and the Porte, forming a quintuple alliance.” In this way the world has been kept upon the ragged edge of uncertainty and suspense, and, the powers concerned, in a state of feverish unrest. For the past twelve month the telegraph has alternately an nounced “war imminent,” and then “more pacific intelligence,” or “the war-cloud has passed away.” Speculation has doubt less had much to do with these rumors of wars and contradictory Statements, but ig norance of the true slate of the case, on the part of those whose business it is to collate these dispatches, is largely responsible for them. Russia is become a colossal power on land, but is comparatively weak upon the sea, for the lack of sufficient coast and ports suitable for the construction and harbor of a powerful navy. The Czar is ambitious to provide himself with these elements of power, and hence is looking towards Turkey to possess himself of them. The other powers, actuated by jealousy and fear, are watching his every move l ' 'lit, resolved that he shall not ag grandize himself, to their own peril, or to the disturbance of the present equilibrium or status. In the event of war, France would be the only one of the western powers to side with the Muscovite. This she will do to be avenged upon Germany and to recover, her lost provinces of Alsace and Loraine, and to wipe out the humiliation of Sedan and the surrender of Paris. A contemporary says that “the practical way to settle the Eastern Question, possi bly for all time, and relieve the TVestcrn nations ultimately from their present pro tection of Turkey against Russian aggres sion, is the establishment of a new European Kingdom, to be made up of the provinces of Roumelia, Macedonia, Thessaly, Albania, Herzegovina, Croatia, Bosnia, Servia, Wallachia, Moldavia, Greece and the Islands of the Archipelago. This would make a large and compact Kingdom with Constantinople as the capi tal; or to make it more compact would be to exchange Moldavia with Austria for Dalmatia, which would then bring it up to and along nearly the whole length of the Adriatic, aud the body of the Kingdom 

JRO2IUI u,- .ihniwft- the 4dcialm the Black Sea. If the people of the present divisions of Turkey in Europe could be made to unite at all, and then with the present Kingdom of Greece and the Islands adjacent, there could be constructed a Kingdom as strong as that of Italy or Austria, it would help the peace of Europe. It would very much assist in disentangling the Eastern question and transfer from Europe to Asia some of the rivalries and jealousies growing out of the present weakened condition of the Turkish Government." Law vs. Anarchy. Minister McLane has been requested by the Municipal Council of Paris to inter cede with the Governor of Illinois in be half of the condemned anarchists of Chicago. Two Assemblies of the Knights of Labor, in Chicago, have passed resolu tions declaring that the trial was an out rage on common justice; and an assault on free speech and the right of the people to assemble for the discussion of their griev ances. Will these Knights of Labor insult the public intelligence so far as to claim that these anarchists were tried for the exercise of free speech and for assem bling to discuss their grievances? Is the throwing of dynamite bombs and the slaughter of twenty or thirty people a right which these people claim to exercise ? If so, then it is the undoubted right of the rest of society to suppress them with powder and ball, and by every other means and appliance known to self-defence. It is understood that these cases have been ap pealed to the Supreme Court, and that the money to pay the costs has been raised by the anarchists. The progress of all these movements is watched with the keenest interest.by the ““ 1 nubile; which is anxious to know if a crime, such as that at Chicago, diabolical in its character beyond all precedent since the days of Guy Fawkes, shall not be avenged by the law. If these condemned criminals should escape justice, by any means whatever, it would do more to un chain the tiger of popular fury than any thing which has ever occurred in this country. Society is bound to protect it self, and if it cannot do it within the forms of law. it will do it without them. The President’s Message. In accordance with the constitutional requirement, President Cleveland on Mon day last sent his annual message to Con gress, giving in detail the operations of the ] government for the past year and such sug- 1 gestions and recommendations as he thought ( were necessary for the general good or for 1 the guidance of the national legislature. The message is written in the President’s j usual terse and vigorous style, and is es- i scntially a business document. It has been , generally commended by the press of both f parties and the independent press. A * good synopsis is published in another s column, the document being too long to 1 give entire in the Advocate. n —————l There is one candidate less in the field r for Governor at the election in 1887. The £ Easton Star announces that Mr. J. Frank w Turner, the present Comptroller, is not a j J candidate. I e 

BULBL 1 Ex (tussive Federal Taxation. Elsewhere in this issue We give an 6k tract from President Cleveland's aribual message, on the subject of taxation and revenue reform. The President expresses himself in no ambiguous terms, and there can be but one meaning extracted from his language. He calls attention to the fact that increased revenue and economy in its collection is resulting in a large surplus over necessary expenses, with no outstanding debt that can be cancelled. This, he says, will not only result in extravagance, and consequent national demoralization, but the exaction from the people of more than enough to meet the expenses of govern ment, economically administered, is ruth less extortion and a violation of the funda mental principles of a free government. The money demanded is exacted in an in direct way, but it is paid by the people as absolutely as though the tax-gatherer col lected the hard cash outright. The rate of federal taxation is about as great now, with a large part of the late war debt extinguished and the balance re funded at a very low rate of interest, as it was twenty-five years ago, when a large army had to be supported, the public debt immense, and when the government paid a high interest. The present condition of affairs, saj-s the President, demand a re vision of the revenue laws so that the re ceipts of the government shall be reduced to the necessary expenses of its economical administration. We call special attention to the extract because the matter of revenue reform is the leading question of the day. Democratic Economy. The Secretary of the Treasury has sent to Congress the estimates of the appropri-, ations for the fiscal year, which will end June 30th, 1888. The total amount esti mated as required for all expenses of the government is §325,185, 1 94, which is §14,403,759 less than the sum called for in the estimates submitted last year, and §3,272,691 less than the aggregate of ap propriations for the present fiscal year. The estimates for tire executive establish ment, the judicial establishment, the mili tary establishment, the naval establish ment, public works and postal service, are in excess of the appropriations for those ! objects for the current fiscal year. There is an increase of about §4,000,000 for * public works, about §3,000,000 for the 1 naval establishment, about §1,000,000 for the military, and about §1,000,000 for the postal service. The estimates are less than the appropriations in the following instan ces : About §20,000 less for the legisla -1 live establishment, over §5,000,000 less for foreign intercourse, about 840,000 less for Indian affairs, over 80,000,000 less for pensions, nearly §2,000,000 less for per manent annual appropriations, and over §2,000,000 less for miscellaneous objects. An Item for Farmers. Forty thousand tons of manilla cord are annually used in the cord-binding harves ters of this country. Manilla hemp pays , a duty of §25 per ton, consequently the t farmers pay one million of dollars per an num on this article alone. In low price of wheat J****- 

VJUMFORTS. bewgUif' '..1 '. . .... ' Hums tax and place manilla on the free list. Everyone can see that a tax of 81,000,- 000 on the cord used by their harvosters, is an odious and oppressive tax. And yet, the Republican party will not touch the tariff because, forsooth, it “protects” American labor! This is the same sortot protection that the wolf gives to the lamb. The Republican party spent, on an aver age, about §13,0110,000 per annum for twenty years, from 1865 to 1885, amount ing to §260,000,000, on a navy, and yet there is scarcely a single vessel afloat, that ( is seaworthy, to show for this immense sum. What did they do with this §260,. 000,000 is a question often asked but never answered. Gov. Lee, of Virginia, has refused to interfere with the decisions of the courts in the case of Thomas J. Cluverius, con victed at Richmond of the murder of Fan nie Lillian Madison. This was the last hope of the condemned man, and he will shortly go to the gallows. A supplement is issued with the Advo cate this week, in order that advertise ments may not encroach too much on space allotted to reading matter. Some interest ing articles will be found in the supple ment, together with a number of adver tisements. The President was so far improved on Tuesday as to be able to preside at the regular Cabinet meeting. “Eternal process” is still “moving on”. The snow storm of Saturday and Sunday extended over a wide area of territory, reach ing from the middle sections of Louisians, Alabama and Mississippi, through the Missis sippi Valley, northeastward, and-the Atlantic coast States, north of Florida. The snow fall in the mountains of South Carolina was G inches; at Chattanooga, 9; at Montgomery, Ala.. 10; at Grenada, Miss., S; at Washington, D. C., 5, and at Baltimore, G. The snow fall in Alabama was the heaviest ever known there. It was freezing all day Saturday at Vicksburg, and in Charleston ice formed in exposed places. The storm was very severe along the New York and New England coasts, with high winds, and on Sunday night it was still snowing at intervals along the coast from North Carolina to Maine. In the interior it was clearing. Heavy sleet and snow contin ued Monday in the Carolinas and Virginia. At Columbia, South Carolina, sleet covered the ground to a depth of from three to six inches, and the street cars and railway trains were stopped. At Asheville, North Carolina, the snow was 26 inches in depth. The Ashe ville Tobacco Works, the Shelton Tobacco Warehouse, and the wholesale provision store of Dickson A Watson were crushed in by the weight of snow upon their roof. In Virginia, snow 15 inches deep is reported at Lynch burg, Harrisonburg and Staunton. Snow, rain and hffil have been almost continuous at Richmond since Saturday morning. Snow fell at Mobile, Alabama, on Sunday from day light until dark. James A. Wales, cartoon artist of Puck, The Judge and other publications, died on Monday in the private office of a restaurant in New Y’ork, after taking a dose of bromide 1 of potassium in some liquor. After drinking the liquor-he stretched himself on a sofa to ' sleep. Some hours later be was discovered i to be dead. A doctor was summoned, and 1 announced his belief that Mr, Wales died of I syncope from organic cardiac disease, result- t ing from an overdose of bromide. In Rending, Penna., Monday, Joseph Sea man met a friend on the street who bad a ■ bottle which he jokingly said contained old t rye and offered Seaman a drink. Seaman * placed tbs bottle to bis mouth, and before be 1 could be slopped drank some of its contents, t which proved to be amonia. His stomach I and intestines were so badly burned that bo t became unconscious. His injuries ate expect- i ed to prove fatal. 1 The Resident's Message. Front the Baltimore Sum The President’s message Id Congress is a comprehensive paper, discussing with special , earnestness and force the leading questions of ( the day, such as the necessity of tariff re form, the interests of labor as affected by ex isting federal taxation, and the suspension of the coinage of silver. After adverting to our , peaceful relations with foreign countries, the Chinese question, the beneficial change effect ed by the Colombian government in erecting Panama into a federal district, the unsettled state of the Canadian fisheries question, the propriety of strengthening our intimacy with Hawaii by renewing the existing treaty, our moral right and duty to assist Liberia in con serving its integrity, the issue of extra terri torial jurisdiction raised by the action of Mexico in the Cutting case, the complaint of the government of the Netherlands in regard to our special tariff impost upon Sumatra tobacco, the Samoan Islands protectorate, our commercial relations with the Spanish Antilles, the international copyright question, and the revision of laws affecting the consular service, the President proceeds to the discus sion of our several national problems. The revenues of the year ended June 30, 1886, show an increase of $13,749,020.68 over last year, there being an increase of $11,434,084.10 from customs and of $4,407,219.04 from in ternal revenue, and a falling off in other re ceipts of $2,092,274.36. The expense of col lecting both customs and internal revenue have been reduced, the net saving being $646,000. The total ordinary receipts were $336,439,727.06, and the total ordinary ex penditures were $242,483,138.50. The ex penses were $17,788,797 less than the preced ing year, and the surplus was $93,956,588.56, an increase over the year ended June 30, 1885, of $30,492,817.29. For the current year the estimate surplus will be ninety mil lions. The income of the government is de clared to be now more than ever in excess of public necessities. The application ot the surplus to the extinguishment of the public debt would retire all the public indebtedness which can be now called in in less than a year. When this is done, either the surplus must be withdrawn from circulation and hoarded in the treasury or wc must engage in wasteful public extravagance. The worst phase of the existing system is the perversion of the relations between the people and the government. When more than is needed to pay the debts of the government and to pro vide for its economical administration is col lected, “such exaction becomes ruthless ex tortion and a violation of the fundamental , principles of free government.” The Presi dent says that those who toil for daily wages are beginning to understand that capital is . sluggish till it springs into activity touched by the hand of labor, and gains the value which 1 enables it to bear the burden of federal taxa i tion, aud they have begun to thoughtfully in quire whether in these circumstances, and considering the tribute they constantly pay i into the public treasury, they receive their fair share of advantages. There is also a suspicion abroad, adds the President, that the surplus ■ indicates abnormal business profits, which, under the system which produces such sur plus, increase, without corresponding benefit ■ to the people at large, great fortunes which are not the natural growth of a steady, plain and industrious republic. The burden to 5 which the agricultural interest, the most im -5 portant of all in the country, is subjected by the increased cost of living caused by the 3 tariff, while its products have to compete r abroad with crops raised by less expensive methods, is pointed out. The laborer will gain 1 by every reduction in the cost of living which r does not involve a reduction in the amount of work or rate of wages. The larger part of our " revenues will have to be collected from cus i toms. Keeping in view all these considera tions, the President recommends that the in creasing and unnecessary surplus of the - national income annually accumulating be re , leased to the people by an amendment to our * revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price 3 of the necessaries of life and give freer en r trance to such imported materials as by American labor may be manufactured into ‘ marketable commodities. The total coinage r of silver dollars since the passage of the Bland bill has been $247,131,549. Of this * amount at the present time the people hold either in coin or silver certificates $166,873,- 041. The recommendation of last year that the coinage be suspended is renewed upon a all the grounds there set forth, reinforced by the significant increase in our gold exporta tions. In treating of array and navy affairs . the President reiterates the absolute necessity ? of better harbor defenses, and the hope is ex * effective steps will be taken > immediately. It is also s ig f the army and navy contract* i purch£ e g 0 un it e d a s to give encouragement 1, or jomestic manufacturers to eat£|vtfie basi- JS& of producing gun steel amfarmor plates. renoct>of tlie Postottufe snow that the present rates ot postage will ultimately suffice to sustain the service, j although our people enjoy now both cheaper , postage, proportionately to distance, and a I vaster and more costly service than any other i nation on the globe. The President suggests that, as distinguished from a grant or a sub sidy, whatever outlay may be required to secure additional postal service, requisite and proper and not otherwise attainable, with the Argentine Republic and the Empire of Brazil ! should be regarded as within the legitimate compensation for such service. The exten- > sion of the free-dclivery system is recommend- I ed. The erection of one or more national penitentiaries for the confinement of persons convicted by the federal courts is urged, and j it is suggested that by employing the convicts in government work they could be made self supporting and at the same time not bo brought into undesirable competition with free labor. The recommendations made last year for an alteration in the organization of federal courts is renewed, as is the suggestion that a change be made in the manner of com pensating attorneys aud marshals. Considerable space in the message is de- j voted to a discussion of the Indian question and the presentation of additional arguments I i in favor of the commission suggested in the last message, which should be able to put in operation different methods of Indian man agement adapted to the different phases of development in which the different tribes are, with tfie ultimate object of alloting to them all lands in severalty and bringing them into the mass of our citizens. The energetic ef forts of the land department under the present administration have succeeded in restoring to the public domain two million seven hundred and fifty thousand acres of land wrongfully appropriated, and almost as much more is now in litigation. The aggregation of public lands in large holdings by persons, many of whom are foreigners, is commented upon as a serious evil. It is recommended that the pre emption and timber culture acts be repealed, ana that the homestead law be so amended as j to make the requirements of residence and cultivation much more strict. Restriction upon the alienation of homestead rights until after patents hayc been issued are also sug gested. Much has been done to secure the removal of unlawful fences from the public domain, but much still remains to be done. The report of the commissioner of pensions shows a net increase of more than 20,000 pen sioners during the year, and the President points out the injustice done by indiscrimi nate pension legislation. The plan suggested by the Secretary of the Interior and approved by the government directors in the Pacific railroads for a change in the method of pay ing the indebtedness of those roads to the government is referred to with the comment that the “only matters” to be considered are the situation of the government as a creditor and the surest way to secure the payment of the principal and interest of its debt. Federal legislation upon the subject of railroad rates for interstate commerce is in the j light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court as a subject worthy of consideration. Upon the question of the relations of labor and capital the recommendations in the spe cial message of last year that the labor bureau be given powers to arbitrate in cases between employers and employes voluntarily referred to it are renewed, and it is declared that after law has done all that it can “much more remains to be accomplished in the rein statement and cultivation of a true American sentiment which recognizes the equality of American citizenship.” The work of the de partment of agriculture is favorably com mented upon and the extension of its function suggested. The application by Congress of such legislation as the constitutional limits will permit to the extinction of the pleuro pneumonia among the cattle of several States is recommended. It is stated that the continued operation of the law relating to the civil service has added the most convincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness, and the cheerful and ungrudg ing support of Congress is invoked for the reform. An increase in the salaries of the civil-service commissioners is recommended. The plain duty of paying the unpaid claims 1 of the depositors in the Frcedmen’s Savings J and Trust Company is called to the attention 1 of Congress, and the message closes with cer tain recommendations relating to the local affairs of the District of Columbia. j The colored men imported from the South I several months ago to take the places of * striking white miners at the Grape Greek Company’s mines at Danville, Illinois, struck ] Monday evening for 75 cents per ton for - mining. They had been working by the day f. but were notified Saturday by the Superin- ( tendeot that commencing on Monday he • would only pay 65 cents per ton. Three e hundred men went out, 1 Excessive* Taxation. j [extract from the president's message.] The income of the government, by its in creased volume and through economies in its collection, is now more than ever in excess of public necessities. The application of the | surplus to the payment of such portion of the public debt as is now at our option subject to extinguishment, if continued at the rate which has lately prevailed, would retire that class of indebtedness within less than one year from 1 this date. Thus a continuation of our present revenue system would soon result in the re- a ceipt of an annual income much greater than necessary to meet government expenses, with 2 no indebtedness upon which it could be ap plied. We should then be confronted with a vast quantity of money, the circulating medium of the people, hoarded in the treasury when it should be in their hands, or we should be drawn into wasteful public extravagance with all the corrupting national demoralization j which follows in its train. But it is not the simple existence of this 1 surplus and its threatened attendant evils 1 which furnish the strongest argument against our present scale of federal taxation. Its worst phase is the Exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of the relations between 1 the people and their government, and a dan gerous departure from the rules which limit the right of federal taxation. Good government, and especially the gov- ] eminent of which every American citizen ( boasts, has for its objects the protection of ( every person within its care in the greatest liberty consistent with the good order of s society and his perfect security in the enjoy- j ment of his earnings, with the least possible i diminution for public needs. When more of the people's substance is exacted through the form of taxation than is necessary to meet 1 the just obligations of the government and 1 the expense of its economical administration, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion i and a violation of the fundamental principles of a free government. 1 The indirect manner in which these exac tions are made has a tendency to conceal their true character and their extent. But we have arrived at a stage of, superfluous revenue which has aroused the people to a realization of the fact that the amount raised professedly for the support of the government , is paid by them as absolutely, if added to the price of the things which supply their daily wants, as if it was paid at fixed periods into the 1 hand of the tax-gatherer. Those who toil for daily wages are begin ning to understand that capital, though some times vaunting its importance and clamoring for the protection and favor of the govern ment, is dull and sluggish till, touched by the magical hand of labor, it springs into activity, furnishing an occasion for federal taxation and gaining the value which enables it to bear ; its burden. And the laboring man is thought- i fully inquiring whether in these circumstances, ! and considering the tribute he constantly 1 pays into the public treasury as he supplies his daily wants, he receives his fair share ot i advantages. i There is also a suspicion abroad that the j surplus of our revenues indicates abnormal j and exceptional business profits, which, under the system which produces such surplus, in crease, without corresponding benefit to the people at large, the vast accumulations of a few among our citizens whose fortunes, rival ing the wealth of the most favored in anti- Democratic nations, are not the natural growth of a steady, plain and industrious re- I public. Oar farmers too, and those engaged directly | and indirectly in supplying the products of | agriculture, see that day by day,' and as often j as the daily wants of their households recur, j ' they are forced to pay excessive and needless I taxation, while their products struggle in for- ! eign markets with the competition of nations, ! which by allowing a freer exchange of pro ductions than we permit, enable their people to sell for prices which distress the American ; ‘ farmer. I As every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly increasing pride of our people in ! American citizenship and in the glory of our | national achievements and progress, a senti- ; ! ment prevailes that the leading strings useful i to a nation in its infancy may well be to a : i great extent discarded in the present stage of , American ingenuity, courage and fearless I self-reliance. And for the privilege of indulg ing this sentiment with true American enthu siasm, our citizens are quite willing to forego an idle surplus in the public treasury. And all the people know that the average rate of federal taxation upon imports is to-day, r in time of peace, but little less, while upon some articles of necessary consumption it is ■- actually more than was imposed by the griev ous burdens willingly borne at a time when k the government needed -millions to maintain : by war the safety and integrity of the Union. It has been the policy of the government to j , collect the principal part of its revenues by a tax upon M>uuris. and no policy is desirable. But the present condi tion of affairs constrains our people to demand that by a revision of our revenue laws the < receipts of the government shall be reduced to the necessary expense of its economical j administration, and the demand should be recognized and obeyed by the people’s repre sentatives in the legislative branch of the | government. 

READJUSTMENT OF THE BURDENS. In readjusting the burdens of federal taxu- : lion a sound public policy requires that such 1 of our citizens as have built up large and im- ; ' portant industries under present conditions should not be suddenly, and to their injury, j deprived of advantages to which they have | adapted their business; but if the public good requires it they should be content with such | consideration as shall deal fairly and cau tiously with their interests, while the just de- ' maud of the people for relief from needless taxation is honestly answered. A reasonable and timely submission to such a demand should certainly be possible with out disastrous shock to any interest, and a cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless action, often the outgrowth of impatience and delayed justice. Due regard should be also accorded in any j proposed readjustment to the interests of ; American labor so far as they are involved, j We congratulate ourselves that there is among us no laboring class, fixed within unyielding bounds and doomed under all conditions to the inexorable fate of daily toil. We nize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of the republic, and we treat those who have it in their keeping us citizens entitled to the most careful regard and thoughtful attention. This regard and attention should be awarded i them, not only because labor is the capital of ( our workingmen, justly entitled to its share of j government favor, but for the further and not j less important reason, that the laboring man surrounded by his family in his humble home, as a consumer is vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost of living and enables him to bring within his domestic circle additional comforts and advantages. This relation of the workingman to the revenue laws of the country, and the manner in which it palpably influences the question i of wages, should not be forgotten in the justi fiable prominence given to the proper main tenance of the supply and protection of well paid labor. And these considerations sug gest such an arrangement of government revenues as shall reduce the expense of liv ing, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work nor reduce the compensation of American labor and injuriously affect its con dition and the dignified place it holds in the estimation of our people. But our farmers and agriculturists—those who from the soil produce the things con sumed by all—are perhaps more directly and j plainly concerned than any other of our citi- i zens in a just and careful system of federal' taxation. Those actually engaged in and 1 i more remotely connected with this kind of i work number nearly one-half of our popula tion. None labor harder or more conlinu ously than they. No enactments limit their hours of toil, and no interposition of the government enhances to any great extent the value of their products. And yet for many of the necessaries and comforts of life r which ] the most scrupulous economy enables them i to bring into their homes, and for their im plements of husbandry they arc obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit which, by the action of the govern ment, is given to the more favored manufac turer. 

REDUCTION OK THE TARIFF. I recommend that, keeping in view all these . considerations, the increasing and unneces sary surplus of national income annually ac cumulating, be released to the people, by an amendment to our revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported material's as by American labor may be man- j ufactured into marketable commodities. Nothing can be accomplished, however, in the direction of this much-needed reform, unless the subject is approached in a patri- , otic spirit of devotion to the interests of the . entire country, and with a willingness to yield j something for the public good. A telegram from the City of Mexico says it is generally believed there “that diplomatic questions of grave importance will sooq arise between the United States and Mexico, growing out of the position taken by Presi- 1 dent Cleveland against the right of Mexico to \ try Aoiericans committing offenses against ( Mexico while on American soil.” The tele gra m adds; “The newspapers of all shades qf opinions stand by the Government in this matter, on the ground that the principle is a sound one and approved by some of the most highly civilised nations of the world,” QHRISTMAS, CHRISTMAS.
