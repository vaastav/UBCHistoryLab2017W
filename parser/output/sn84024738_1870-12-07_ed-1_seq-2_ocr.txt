11 ? 11 r'li' m rmifciiriniini*. . WEDNESDAY DECEMBKS 7. isTO, _ The President's Message. We publish the President's messago in fdll this morning. The comments which we Indulged in yesterday we see no reason for modifying. The Washington Patriot commences its review of the message in almost Identically the same word? we em ployed in a like manner* It says, " the "message sets out with a flagrant perver '? *lon of truth.'* The President's recom mendations are many of them good enough/ but his acts prove him to be a hvpocntc, and therefore all his professions ???st S? for nothing. For instance, in defining policy of his Administration, he says that one feature of it consist? In the " securing "a pure, untramelled ballot, where every 44 man entitled to vast a vote may do so just " once at each election, without fear of mo lestation or proscription on account of "his political faith, nativity, or color." This language from a man who has sta tioned soldiers near every voting place, and done more to corrupt the ballot-box and enable hirelings to vote a dozen times if they please, than all the other Presidents who preceded him, is an insult to the good wnse of the people of this country. It shows that the party in power is as liberal in professions and as derelict in perform ance as ever villains were. We have no patience with such hypocrisy. The President says the amount of taxes has been reduced by some eights' millions of dollars. It is also claimed that the amount of taxes collected has been in creased by a large sura. The two stories cut one another's throats. The amount of tax collected this year is larger than it was last year. There i8 no getting round this fact. It is another attempt to deceive, mis lead, and humbug the voters to say that the taxes have been reduced. The only basis for the statement is the attempt of Congress to reduce it by taking otf the tax imposed upon certain articles and reducing that imposed upon others. The President is eloquent upon the sub ject of tho acquisition of ?an Domingo. We look upon his.recominendatlons in this regard with no disfavor. We approve of the recommendations that the franking privilege be abolished and postal cards be authorized. Tho latter will be carried out ; tbe former will not. We also endorse Air. Boctwell's part of the message. It is in bis best style. Beast Butler's contribution we heartily con join. BtJi enou^* would fain extend our WOifflent* f>ut baVe not spacc Ior ulore 01 them.

ELECTION La. rlnsr to Lewis McKenzie's petty prete^v questioning the right of Col. Braxton* to a seat in tbe next House of Representatives, and for the purpose of correcting any mis apprehensions which might arise from the manner in which the contest is spoken oi' by the Radical papers", we elate that the Virginia election law is as liberal in the matter of contested elections as language could make It. It provides* tint in judging of all contested elections "the court shall proceed upon the merits thereof." Tliis is now. and has been for nearly twenty years, the law of Virginia in regard to contested elections ; and every lawyer knows thai this language means that mere technicali ties are to be overlooked and substantial justice done. In 1852 the defeated Demo cratic candidates contested the election of the successful Whig candidates in Hamp shire county ; and although an inspection of the poll-books showed tbat scarcely one in ten of the many returned to the court nouse from the various precincts of that large county was made out as it should have been or certified as the law required, the court, under the act of Assembly we have quoted, decided that it must look only to "the merits" of the case, and, doiogso, found that the Whig candidates had re reived a majority of all the votes recorded, and for this reason (that is, upon the merits of the case) awarded all the offices to them. The decision was proper, just, right, con sistent with common sense, and a good pre cedent for the courts to follow. ? Congress professes to be governed by exactly the same law. It protends to decide all con* tested-election cases on their own merits, throwing aside technical informalities as unworthy of its notice. If its practice shall correspond with its professions, Col. Brax ton will have no difficulty in getting his fceat. The Revenue Reformers.? A "Washing ton telegram states that 011 Monday, durinp the recess taken to await the message, Sen ators and members indulged in a good (leal of conversation on the recent elections, and Messrs. Trumbull and Schurz stated very promptly that they were in no third party movements, nor in any hostility to the Ad ministration. The latter stated that he had always been a Republican, aud intended to continue one. These politicians are not reliable people. They don't always speak the truth. They ure like the maiden, who, "vowing she would never consent, consented." Schurz and Trumbull will be among the leaders of the new movement, let them protest never so vehemently that they are friends to Gen. Grant. Census of Virginia.? We have taken from the tables of the* census of I860 the statement of the population of each of the fifty counties which constitute the Slate of West Virginia, and added the figures to gether, and have thus learned that they then had a population of 376,688. The pop ulation of the undivided State of Virginia was returned at 1,596,318. Taking the one total from the other, we find that in 1860 the population of Virginia as she now stands was 1,218,630. The ceusus of 1S70 shows her population to he 1 ,'228,672. If this hist census Is correct, Virginia has increased in population in ten years, only 8,?42. Population or Bicbmom>.? The populn tion of Richmond in 1660 whs 37,010. In 1870 it is returned at 51,003? a gain much larger than the entire increase of popula tion in the whole State of Virginia, if tbe new census may be relied upon. But it will be said that the city's limits have been extended since 1860. Then take the population of Henrico county and Hieh mond city together. In 1860 it was 61,616. In 1870 it Is ret urned at 70,276? a still greater gain. Where has all the decrease been felt? POTMarriON.? -Messrs. "W*. H.? Jarvis, JaXBO DlATOJ*, P. C. HiTCHEB; and Irvix P. Hoio. of Petersburg, have been Arrested (the first two for the second time) on the charge of violating tbe enforcement act. It is time this persecution were stopped. Let the General Assembly pass a la^" pun ishing by fine and imprisonment every man concerned in a causeless arrest and pel secu tion of oor people. Tha thing would soon be stopped. The enforcement act is so clearly unconstitutional that It deserves only to be despjs** 9 The "Xew MoVEXEXT" IK TH?k-% have received a letter from II prominent gentleman In Texas nuking that a copy of our last platform be sent to him.

How the Prcsrdoni'H Message wna Rc ceivo<l-Wt?y He Ch?njr?l his Mlu<t Concerning (icneral Amnesty? A Lnrce Proporiion in Congress Fa vorable Thereto? Attacks on Schurs, Etc. [Special Correspondence nf the Dispatch ] Washington, Dec. 5, 1870. The President's message falls rather flat even among his Republican friends. There is as little enthusiasm over it as has ever) been exhibited, even as little as greeted his first Cabinet announcement. Manv of his friends are disappointed that he did not recommend a general amnesty law, which they understood to have been hie Intention when the tirst draft of the message was pre pared. That he has not done so Is taken as evidence suilicient to show the fact that Grant depends upon the Drake-Sumner Butler wing of the party for his renomina tion. These are types* of the ultra Radi cals who would never favor general amnes ty, and it will be seen that duringthe present session, as in every previous one alter the war, their voices will be heard in lavor of proscription and in opposition to every liberal sentiment that nobler men are in clined to advance. The St. l)omin<io part of the message ex cites anything out favorable comment among the President's friends, and the strong advocacy of that scheme is regarded as a ,4 lobby " job of stupendous propor tions. The ?neers at England, and every item of the message savoring of a willingness to get into a row, falls very flat, and it is certain that Congress will not be influenced, as in deed it will not by anv portion of the docu ment. Several of the Republican members In both Houses express themselves very favor ably on the subject of a general amnesty law. This is particularly the case with men professing to represent the Southern and middle States They see the " handwriting on the wall " plainly enough. Tt is certain that the silent consent to the furtherance of h prescriptive policy uiven by the President will not have a similar sympathy in Con gress to the same extent, sis it did last vear. Grant pledges himself to it, but will be found in the minority. The Congressionalcommittee which made the formal announcement to the President to-day that both Houses were ready to re ceive communications were ushered into the Red Parlor bv (General Dent, and the (ceremony of so informing (he President h?? \vuKe tleie' They did not remain at the bite House more than tive minutes, ^mediately upon the announcement of ?eting of Congress, General Porter, secretary of the President, left toe Xu.. ?nsion with the messa?e. the Prnatt . ? ^enutors wiJJ 800?n , the Executive jjw ? ]isU it u sai(f A caucus ol Radicju .. held to revise the committv. ' , The reason of I his is plain euoufc. , | is to be punished, iiis liberal vieWb bad enough before, but, now that they hav*. found no favor in executive circles, they become doubly abominable to Grant's friends. There is some anxiety to know what particular course the proscriptionists will purMie towards Scburz ; but it is a satisfaction to the friends of the latter to know that he, at least, is equal to the emer gency, and ready for the fray whenever his quandam confreres are disposed to inaugu rate it. Timon. Fcneral of Rev. Dr. Bagby.? An Im mense concourse ot people? some of them from a great distance? gathered at Bruing ton on the 4th to hear the funeral discourse in memory of Rev. Richard Hugh Bagby, 1 D. D. It will be remembered that in his last moments he requested Rev. Andrew Broaddus, of Caroline, bis most cherished friend, to discharge this duty, and all felt that it could not be left in abler or more faithful band*. At an early hour the crowd began to gather, aud though the meeting house is unu>ually lar?e, several hundred persons failed to obtaiu seats. Revs, An drew and Luther Broaddus, Baynhum, i<-v ans, Turpin, Land. A. Bagby,* Pollard of Baltimore, Kyland of Alexandria, Scott, Digges, (ireeham, and Shackleford were present, nearly all of whom took part eithfcr in the generafor introductory services. Mr, Broaddus announced for his text : " A good soldier of Jesus Christ," II. Tim : 2 and 3, and for an hour aud lifteen jrninutes dis cussed with con-picuous ability." Horse-Thievrs.? Oflieer Gore, of this ; place, captured a negro man in Prince "Wil liam county on Thursday who bad in his possession a horse stolen from Mrs. Beadles, of Caroline county. The thief refused to give up until after'two shots had been fired at him, one of which took effect in an arm and another in one of his legs. The des perate character of tho thief may be gathered from the further fact that whilst Officer Gore was bringing him back, lead ing the horse on which he was mounted, the negro seized a favorable opportunity, slipped" off, and immediately disappeared in the adjacent woods. Thieves are busy just now. Air. Doswell, near Hanover Juuc ! tion, lost two mules within ten days.? | f Ycdericksburg Herald \ Corporation ?mall NoTEa.-? The small note*' issued by the corporaiion during the Jeriod when K. B. Semple, deceased, and . L. Marye, Jr., were Mayors of Frede ricksburg, have not all been redeemed as yet. The Council has directed that they shall be received for taxes, and as not com ing under the operation of the resolution adopted October 11th, 1870, for the employ ment- of counsel to defend actions brought or to be brought against the corporation for bonds clue or to become due, to prevent uny one creditor from obtaining priority of lien or other advantage. ? Frcdericlcsbura Herald. Judge Bond.? This distinguished jurist came here last summer, it was said, at the instance of Governor li olden, to investigate the Burgin case. After keeping Burgin in jail for two or three mouthy he released him ou Monday night last without letting tue sheriff or the counsel for the prosecu tion kuow of it until alter the prisoner had left and got beyond the bounds ot the State. On Wednesday at 3 o'clock his Honor de livered his opinion in the Burgin case, in which the partisan feeling of the Judge is as visible as it is in his conduct in secretly releasing him.? Raleigh Sentinel. Remarkable Man.? Mr. Ralph Clayton, living near St. Louis, Mo., and tormerly of this county, now on a visit to his friends in ! this county, will he eighty-tbree years old on the 22d of February, and is as aetive in bodv and mind as he ever was in his life. He left this county about twenty years ago, and purchased a "farm for $7,000, wlrich is now worth $250,000. It i? situated within Tour miles of toe city. He takes his gun and hunts through the mountains with as much activity as a young man of twenty years.? Staunton Spectator . Extremely 111.? A letter was received here yesterday from tbe physician who is attending Mr. E. A. Pollard, in New York, which represents that his disease has as sumed a very unfavorable phase, and that there are no hopes of his recovery. His complaint yields to no medical treatment, and nis most hopeful friends are now pre pared to hear of his demise at any moment. Lynchburg Republican. agThe Dispatch has hit it exactly.
