There has not been near so much rain at Big Springs bb there has been at Fort Worth and the weather has been so warm that the stock have not begun to feel the winter A few more facts about sorghum rais ing for cattle were gleaned by a reporter jesterday from stockmen of Fort Worth who have tried it When the cane is to be used for feeding it is sown broadcast like wheat or oats and Is usually cut just before it ripens The only precaution necessary to prevent its spoiling through the winter i3 to allow it to lie on the ground three or four days until it is per fectly dry4 then it can be stacked It is not so good if it is allowed to thoroughly xlpen before cutting as it becomes woody1 and tough It is just as nutric ious if cut a little preen and is liked bet ter by the etock The assertion was made by ope stockman that it was unhealthy but others disputed this saying any grain is unhealthy if fed in too large quantities And that overfeeding sor ghum is the onlv means by which it can be made injurious One of the best informed railroad men in the south said yesterday that the peo ple in every county in Texas should at once organize immigration societies and have prepared

immediately on Mr A C Wilmeth of Scurry county was spoken to yesterday about the condition of stockmen along the Texas and Pacific The range he said west of Taylor county is good The snow which fell west of Sweetwater did no damage to the grass as it dried oft half an hour after it fell The stock is all in good fix The two questions troubling the stockmen now he says are the low prices and tne scarcity of cars on the rail road The matter of prices has less ter rors for them since the firmness of the Cnicago markets set in a week ago and they do not expect them to fall back sgain As evidencing the faith western people have in better markets next year Mr Wilmeth says some of the4 well fixed peo ple are paying Chicago prices for cattle on the range to those who are compelled to sell with the intention of holding them till spring As to the scarcity of cars he says the railroad is 650 cars behind orders at Colorado City One cattle company two weeks ago turned loose 1000 bead from a station where they had taken them to ship see ing there was no chance of getting the cars in reasonable time Mr A P Moore manager of the Rio Cattle Company of Fisher county was seen at the Mansion House last night He had been at Albany when Mathews Reynolds made their first shipment from there in the street stable cars and was favorably impressed with the value of those cars in the future shipping trade They are divided into three sections he explained so that different kinds of stock can be carried in the same car but in separate compartments The facilities furnished for watering en route will be of great value in hot weather and as feeding can be done on the cars the steps between Texas and Chicago will be fewer and shorter for all the cattle will have to stop for will be to rest and one unload ing on the trip will be enough The street stable cars stand in the same relation to the old style that Pullman palace cars do to the ordinary passenger coaches The stock and range of the Rio Com pany are In firstrate condition The only thins troubling the western stockmen now is the scarcity of cars to ship by as there are a great many beeves and feeders being held awaiting the pleasure of the railroads Mr Moore goes to Chicago tonight Mr W H Fasch who has been en gaged in all branches of the stock raising business in West Texas for the past ten years was at the Mansion house yester day and in the course of a conversation gave the reporter some pointers ifjIPM vi iu > iir fi s < i7r of graylSreeye rrOld mares brought 10Marge5g3Faggteare75 an ordinary pinto 75

prices paid and circumstances of the sale give an idea of what the demand is for the Texas horses The San Antonio correspondent of the Tex + s Live Stock Journal says the latest start in the way of Texas refrigeration is at Fnlton a little town on Aransas Bay He says at that point ten or twelve years ago were erected large slaughtersg houses for taking the hide and tallow from the thousandsof cattle that over stocked the millions of teres of open lands of Southwest Texas Subse quently a better market for them was found in the northern drive and the establishments were closed Soon after one of them was remodeled for a cannery by a Boston firm and run for several years but the cattle boom put prices above profitable canning and the establishment was again closed Addi tions must be made for refrigerating and then it will be in proper shape In location it has superior advantages Mr Burke Burnett arrived back In the city yesterday from a trip to his ranches in the Panhandle and the Nation where he had gone to see what had been the effect of the late rains on his range He found everything in good condition up to this time but is not Ijisp certain of the continuance of these of the as are a great many PanfiaBdle stockmen whose opinions have been secured The grass as yet has not been damaged to any great extent and the cattle are in good condition and have drifted but very little When asked how the outlook of the markets appeared to him he declined to say anything as he considered it a matter too doubtful to form any opinion upon He says stockmen on the Fort Worth and Denver road are in as bad or worse condition in the matter of ship ping facilities as are those along the Texas and Pacific Ed Est he says held a large drove of cattle at the road for twelve days through the late cold and wet weather waiting for cars Mr R H Porter of Abilene manager of the St Louis Cattle Company was in the citv last night Mr Porter speaks favoraoly of the condition of cattle and range in his neigh borhood He says the only thing stockmen have to kick about out there is the low prices to be had for their beeves and this he thinks will be remedied in a short time Losses in the northwest the selling out of cattle of all kind3 by str ck men all over the country the number of cows that have been spayed during the last year or two and the small number of cattle being fed this winter owing to the scarcity of feed will create a scarcity of marketable stock nex year that will bring about a firmer market Mr Porter has been raising a great deal of sorghum and millet for feeding and although his crop was rather light this year owing to there being no fall rain in time to do any good he has found sorghum grow ing successful and remunerative He does not think the present rains will do any harm in the west to stock proper ty unless it turns cold immediately after Mr George Wilcox of Seven Rivers N M was in the city yesterday looking for horses He does not speak very favor ably of the condition of the range and cattle there In the course of cinversation Mr Wilcox ex pressed surprise at the large num ber of small stock owners from Texas who were pouring into New Mexico He ventured to say tna within two days after quarantine was raised November 110000 head of stock had passed over into that territory from Texas He did not know how they were going to pull through out there In the winter the crass is very good and the weather generally veryjfavorable to stock interests but when spring comes the only grazing land is along the banks of the rivers and streams and there were already all the cattle in the Territory that the grass on those limited ranges would suppirt Most of the people going there from West Texas are farming stockmen with from fifty to 200 head of stock They calculate to raise hay and feed for the cattle but Mr Wilcox is at a loss to see where they are going to settle to carry out those planB in New Mex co on cattle feeding that are of interest A stockman feeding cattle in Texas J will use from thirty to fifty bushels of corn to the head according to the length of the feeding season That is a reason able estimate Now in those portions of the state where cattle are fed it requires two acres of land to grow these say thirty bushels of corn necessary to feed oue head in a rj a7erage year Now sorghum far J purposes Ql Ceding possesses qualiti J equal to comj and oco acre of land sown WitQ sorghum will in the very poorest year yield feed sufficlPi u for one head of stock r a in a favoraole year enough for four or five head Besides this advantageand what is of great importance sorghum In Texissrcan always be relied upon to fur nish a good yield for the land in this state is in every way adapted to its grow ing The plant
