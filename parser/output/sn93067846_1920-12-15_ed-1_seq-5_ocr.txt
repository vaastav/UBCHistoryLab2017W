The Uur.es for 1920 now being paid are the heaviest which have ever been levied and ihey were required b? eaues of appropriations very much moi.. ? il than any appropriations ever before made, but the appropria ttons proposed for 1921 are more than half as much again as the ai propna tions for 1920.

WILSON AWARDED NOBEL PRIZE Great Work Yet to Be Done, Says President Cbrtstl&nla, Doc lo.?Tho distribu? tion of tho Nobel prison was made lu re this afternoon. The principal awards?the peace prizes for 1919 and IS2i??were given respectively to Leon Bourgeois of France and Wood W Wilson, president of the United States. The peace prizes were presented in the storthing- during the after? noon at a ceremony which was shorn of all ostentation. The literature and <>thor prizes were delivered this even? ing" in the Academy of the Muses In presence of the ro.va 1 family. The document presenting the pOftce nrlse to Pr< sldent Wilson and also the Nobel medal were received by Albert 'I Behmedemann, the American min? ister to Norway who read a message Of thanks from President Wilson. President Wilson m his letter ac? cepting the Nobel peace prize, said that if this were the last peace prize to he offered he could not accept "for mankind has not yet been rid of the unspeakable horrors of war." In the years to come, the president added, there will he "abundant opportunity for others to distinguish themselves in the crusade against hate and fear and war." "In accepting the honor of your iward." said the president's letter. "I am moved not only hy a profcand gratitude for the recognition of my p or nest efforts in the cause of pence, ?ot als.-? by a very poignant humility before the vastness of the work, still a'led for by this cause. "May I not take this occasion to ex? press my respect for the farsighted wisdom of the founder in arranging for a continuing system of awards? If 'here were but one prize or if this were to 1)0 the last I could not. of ?nurse, accept it. for mankind has not vet been rid of the unspeakable horror rif war. I am convinced that our gen ration has despite its wounds made notable progress. But it is the bet? ter part of wisdom to consider our work as only begun. It will be a con? tinuing labor. In the indefinite course af years before us there will be abund? ant Opportunity for others to distin? guish themselves in the crusade against liate and fear and war. "There is. indeed, a peculiar fitness In 'ho grouping of tht se Xobel awards. The cause of peace and the sa?SC of truth are of one family. Even as those who love science and levote their lives to physics or chem? istry, even as those who would cre? ate new and higher ideals for man? kind In literature, even so with 'hcso who love peace, there is no limit set. Vhatever has been accomplished in he past is petty compared to the rlory and promise of the future." Mtnisl r Behmedemann said in his i ddress: "The henor bestowed bn President Wilson is of significance and of the utmost satisfaction to me. To have 'he privilege of accepting on behalf ^f the president the evidence of his ippreclatten of his offort to replace ItSCOrd with harmony by appealing t . the highest moral forces of each Sa? lon is an event to be cherished. He, porhspg as much as any public man. Is conscious of the fact that he time is past when each nation an live only unto itself. His labors have been inspired with the idea gad he hope of making peace universal It is impossible to make a proper SS? mate Of President Wilson and of his rent work for international peace un il time has revealed much of that wh|ch for the present must be a seal d book. No more fitting word Of ppreclation could he voiced than that contained In the presidents message which acknowledges the great honor onferred upon him."
