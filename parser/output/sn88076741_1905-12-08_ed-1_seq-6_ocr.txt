Art and politics may yet 'F-.SFf" Mr, i. 1 h/* go The following is a synopsis of the president's message: "The people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity," says the president in his opening paragraph. He then proceeds to give various con ditions and circumstances which make for or against general prosperity and leads up to the question of corpora tions, of which he says: "The for tunes amassed through corporate or ganization are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of necessity to give,to the sovereign—that is to the government, which represents the peo ple as a whole—some effective power of supervision over their corporate use. In order to insure a healthy so cial and industrial life, every big cor poration should be held responsible by, and accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control its conduct. I am in no sense hostile to corpora tions. This is an age of combination, and every effort to prevent all combi nation will be not only useless, but In the end vicious, because of the con tempt for law which the failure to en force law inevitably produces. The corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored as long as it does good. But each should be sharp ly checked where it acts against law and justice." The president points out the useless ness of any attempt to secure regula tion and control of corporations by state action. Such regulation and su pervision can only be effectively exer cised by the national government, and the president believes proper power can be secured by enactment of laws by congress if the Constitution will not permit this action, then the Con stitution should be amended conferring upon congress full power to enact ad equate legislation. Ke continues: "What is needed is not sweeping prohibition of every arrangement, good or Dad, which may tend to re strict competition, but such adequate supervision and regulation as will pre vent any restriction of competition from being to the detriment of tne public—as well as prevent other abuses in no way connected with re striction of competition. Until the national government obtains proper control oVer big corporations engaged in interstate commerce it will he im possible to deal adequately with the evils. Government Regulation of Railroad Rates Is Strongly Urged—Insur ance Legislation Needed. Control of Railroad Rates. "The immediate and most pressing need, so far as legislation is concern ed, is the enactment into law or some scheme to secure to the aeents ot the government such supervision and reg ulation of the rates charged by tiie railroads of the country engaged In interstate traffic as ptn ll summarily and effectively prevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must, include putting a complete stop to rebates in every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like a'l similar powers over the Ixisin world, should be exercised wit mod eration, caution and self-restrain but it should exist, so that it can be ef fectively exercised when the need arises. "The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be affirmative and should be given to some administration body created hy congress. I do not believe in the gov ernment interfering with private busi ness more than Is necessary. I do not believe in the government undertaking any work which can with propriety be left in private hands. But neither do I believe in the government flinching from overseeing any work when it becomes evident that abuses are sure to obtain therein unless there is gov ernmental supervision. In my judg ment the most important provision which the law should contain is that conferring upon some competent ad ministration body the power to decide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found to be unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be law ful to go—the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly called—this de cision to go into effect within a rea sonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate is too high but that a favored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the com mission would have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum: and it would need only one or two such decisions hv the commission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving improper minimum rates. My proposal is not Mark Twain's first meeting with James McNeill Whistler seems to have been characteristic of both celebri ties. This is how the famous humorist describes it in some of his recollec tions: "I was' introduced to Mr. Whistler In his studio in London. I had heard that the painter was an incorrigible Joker, and I was determined to get the better ot 'c MumW Trl him, if possible. Bo I at once tnt an my most hopelessly stupid air, At .V*. A ... 'v'1 ,//'.N to give the commission power to ini tiate or or originate rates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the roads, upon com plaint and after investigation. A heavy penalty should be enacted from any corporation which fails to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railroad regu lation." "I aslt this legislation not only in the interest of the public, but in the interest of the honest railroad man and the honest shipper alike, for it is they who are chiefly jeopardized by the practices of their dishonest com petitors." Labor. The president devotes considerable space to the discussion of labor prob lems. Regarding the demand for de priving courts of the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes, he says: "Such special limitation of the equity powers of our courts would be most unwise." The president's remedy is to regulate the procedure by requiring the j,udge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to be ex-parte if the adverse party docs not appear at the time and place ordered. He renews recommendations made in his last message for an investigation by the department of commerce and labor of general labor conditions. Insurance. "Recent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question, as to whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than- the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the head of these large corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction between hon esty and dishonesty they draw the line only this side of what may be called law—honesty, the kind of hon esty necessary to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. There is need of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast insurance interests of this country. That state supervision has proved inadequate is generally conceded." The president concludes this subject by urging con gress to carefully consider whether adequate legislation can be had. The Revenues. "There is more need Of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal perfection in the methods of raising revenue and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these methods render such change inadvisable uu less for grave reason. In time of peace the revenue must on the aver age, taking a series of years together, equal the expenditures or else the rev enues must be increased. Last, year there was a deficit. Unless our ex penditures can be kept within the rev enues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. The Currency. The president points out the need of the addition of the element of elas ticity to our currency, so that the cur. rency will contract against specula tion, and will expand for the needs of legitimate business. Reforms in Methods. Congress is urged to consider the question of necessary reforms in the business methods of the various de partments of the government, so as to promote the economy, efficiency and high character of government work. The president repeats former rec ommendations for the enactment of a law directed against bribery and cor ruption in federal elections. Hague Conference. Congress is urged to do all in its power to further the movement for another Hague conference and to make the result of its decisions effec tive. The president hopes that the conference may be able to devise some way to make arbitration between nations the customary way of settling international disputes. Army and Navy. The importance of providing by ap propriation provision for maneuvers of a practical kind to increase the effi ciency of the army is earnestly recommended. Increase in the coast artillery force is also recommended. Of the navy the president says: "We have most wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy. and it has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard of efficiency must not only be main tained, but increased." The president does not think it nec esssary to increase the navy beyond 

„J1IVI1 the present number units, but to sub- president says, are in stitute efficient, for inefficient units as terly inadequate, the latter become worn out. He thinks as I drew near a canvas which Whistler was completing. '"That, ain't bad,' I said. 'It ain't bad only here in this corner*—and I made as if to rub out a cloud effect with my finger—'I'd do away with that cloud If I were you.' this result could be attained by add: ing a single battleship to our navy each year. There is urgent need of a large in crease in the number of officers and enlisted men. Recent naval history, according to the president, has emphasized the fact that the main- strength of the navy lies, and can only lie, in the battle-, ships. The important part played in the naval conflict by torpedo boat de stroyers, submarines, scouts and fast cruisers is also pointed out. The importance of revising our sys tem of naturalizing aliens is strongly urged, as is also revision of the crim inal laws of the United States. Legislation providing for suitable punishment for breaches of trust in public service is urgently recommend ed. Public Land Laws. The president again calls attention to the condition of the public land iaws. He says that the iniquitous methods by which the monopolizing of the public lands is being brought about under the present, laws are be coming more generally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effec tive remedies. I-Ie says the recont mendations of the public lands com mission upon this subject are wise and should be given effect. Civil Service. The president says that any attempt to carry on the great executive depart ments of the government without the civil service law would inevitably re sult in chaos. The civil service com missioners are doing excellent work: and .their compensation is inadequate considering the service they perform. Concluding on this subject, be says: "The civil service law is being ener geticallly and impartially enforced, and in the large majority of cases complaints of violations of either the law or rules are discovered to be un founded. The question of politics in the appointment and retention of the men engaged in merely ministerial work has been practically eliminated in almost the entire field of govern ment employment covered by the civil service law." The Philippines. "During the last year the Philippine islands have been slowly recovering from the series of disasters which, since American occupation, have great ly reduced the amount of agricultural products below what was produced in Spanish times. The war, the rinder pest, the locusts, the drought and the cholera have been united as causes to prevent a return of the. prosperity much needed in the islands. The most serious is the destruction by the rin derpest of more than 75 per cent of the draft cattle. The income of the Philippine government has necessarily been reduced by reason of the busi ness and agricultural depression and the government has been obliged to exercise great economy. The transfer of the friar lands has been effected. "Tranquillity has existed during the past year throughout the archipelago, except in the province of Cavite, the province of Saniar, and in the island of Jolo among the Moros. The dis turbances have all now been suppress ed. The most encouraging feature of the whole situation has been the very groat interest taken by the common people in education. The president earnestly recom mends that the tariff now imposed by the Dingley bill upon the the products of the Philippine islands be entirely removed, except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be re duced to 2G per cent of the present rates that after July 1, 1909, the tar ff on sugar and tobacco produced iu the Philippine islands be entirely re moved, and that free trade between the islands and the United States in the products of each country then be provided for by law.

"After that," adds Mr. Clemens, "we got on very well together." fZ,s .4 In the judgment of the president immediate steps'should be taken for the fortification of Hawaii. Admission to Statehood. The president recommends that In dian Territory and Oklahoma be ad mitted as one state and that New Mex ico and Arizona be admitted as one state. The Panama Canal. "The American people is pledged to the speediest possible construction of a canal adequate to meet the demands which the commerce of the world will make upon it, and I appeal most ear nestly to congress to aid in the ful fillment of the pledge. Gratifying progress has be«jn made during the past, year, and especially during the past four months. The greater part of the necessary preliminary work has been done. The work of sanitation has been thoroughly accomplished. "What is needed now and without delay is an appropriation to meet the current and accruing expenses of the Commission." In Conclusion. In conclusion, the president recom mends more adequate provision than has been made heretofore for the work of the department of state. Neither jit. home nor abroad is there a suffi cient working force to do the business properly.

St. Petersburg,, via Berlin, Dec. 5.— Intense alarm prevails here. Com munication with the outer world by telegraph ceased Saturday morning when the Finnish operators joined their Russian comrades. The imputation is almost in a state of panic, fearing, that the railroads will stop running and that the inhabi tants, therefore, will have no mode of flight in the event of the cataclysm which they seem to fear is imminent. Stories of the spread of disaffection ii^ the guard regiments are in every body's mouth and the revolutionaries continue to boast that the troops will no longer fire on the people. Troops in Open Mutiny. The Associated Press has just /earned from a high authority that the situation in the Baltic provinces has grown exceedingly grave and that, the troops at Reval and neighborhood are in open mutiny. All attempts to secure details of the uprising have thus far failed. Ac cording to reports the attitude of the troops in the Baltic provinces is re garded by the government as the most dangerous factor that has thus far de zeloped. Count Witte continues to refuse to deal with the telegraphers, declaring that for the government to yield would be equivalent to its abdication at their order. Mutiny at Kieff. London, Dec. 5.—The Daily Mail's. Kieff correspondent in a dispatch dated Dec. 2, and forwarded by way of Podwoloczyska, says: "Early this morning a company of sappers, dissatified with their mar tinet. commander, mutinied and per suaded a second company to join them. Numbering a thousand, the mutineers marched to the barracks of the 125t,h Kursk infantry, which, however, remained loyal. Finally the mutineers arrived at the barracks of the aritllery division and the Azoff in fantry regiment. Fifty Are Killed. "The Azoff men answered their ap peal With insults and the rebels opened fire upon them. The Azoffs answered with three volleys. A por tion of the mutineers lied, but the others continued firing. The Azoffs replied with deadly volleys, and finally the rebels fled headlong", throwing down their arms. Two hundred of them surrendered and were conveyed to their barracks by Cossacks. Fifty dead and a hundred wounded muti neers were left on the ground. "A court-martial has been convened "and notice issued that any further at tempt at mutiny will be quelled by ar tillery." Troops Rebel at Odessa. Vienna, Dec. 5.—The Tageblatt. pub lishes a communication from Odessa, which was mailed to Podwoloczyska. Galicia, from which point It was tel egraphed. It reads as follows: "The Ismaili and Donau regiments, stationed at Odessa, mutinied, but the authorities succeeded in disarming alt the men." Warships Disarmed. Paris, Dec. 5.—Undated dispatches from St..

Heavy, Plumb Bob la Hurled Through Window ot ItooMvelt'o Train. Waihington, Dec. 6. Some uniden tified person hurled a heavy iron plumb bob through a window ot one of the cars of President Roosevelt's special train Saturday night on the" run from, Princeton to Washington. The tnlsslle, which was thrown with terrific force, crashed through the glass transom of a window of the combination car Salvlus and fell at the feet of Maj. Webb Hayes, son of the late president Rutherford B. Hayes, who was a guest of the president on the trip to the army and navy foot ball game. Fragments of broken glass fell on Maj. Hayes, who was sitting with his. back to the window, reading, but did not injure him in any way. Maj. Hayes stooped and picked up the iron missile which so narrowly had missed his head, and then arose and exam ined the broken window. Going Slow in Fog. The frame of the window was' brok en where The plumb bob had struck it., so great was the force with which it had been hurled. The train at the time about 7:30 o'clock—was running comparatively slow, owing to a dense fog which had rendered it almost im possible for the engineer to see a train length ahead of him. Broad street in North Philadelphia had just, been crossed, and the train was in the vicinity of Exford street when the crash of glass aroused the occupants of the car. The Salvius was the first car of the train, and in appearance might have been mistaken very easily for the president's private car. That was, however at the rear of the train. It was remarkable also that Maj. Hayes from a profile view strongly re sembles the president, and that sit ting at the window in the position he occupied in reading, he might have been mistaken for President Roose velt. Stones Recently Thrown. Doubt was expressed by Pennsyl vania road officials who were on the train whether the missile was intend ed to be hurled at the train. They said that several times recently stones have been thrown at trains passing through North Philadelphia, and on one recent occasion a man sitting near one of the windows of a train was se verely cut by glass broken by a heavy stone thrown through it. The implement was a most unusual weapon to be in the hands of a boy, who might in a spirit of deviltry throw a stone at a train. It is of cast iron and '•weighs about three pounds. Had it struck Maj. Hayes on the head, as it certainly would if it had' passed through the window a foot lower, he would have been injured very serious* ly, if not killed. A Wanton Act. The president knew nothing of the incident for some time after it oc curred. He made no comment upon it, pqsping it off as the wanton act of some irresponsible person. As a mat ter of precaution the curtains oil the special train were drawn down when the news of the incident reached the passengers. The secret service officials who ac companied the president took charge of the missile and. an effort will be made to apprehend the person who threw it. To Be Investigated. Philadelphia, Dec. 5.—As a result of the casting of a plumb bob ?mo Pres ident. Roosevelt's special as it was passing through the northern part of this city Saturday night, the Pennsyl vania railroad officials and the Phila delphia police authorities have united in a determined effort to break up the practice of throwing missiles at trains. A thorough investigation of Saturday night's incident is in prog ress.
