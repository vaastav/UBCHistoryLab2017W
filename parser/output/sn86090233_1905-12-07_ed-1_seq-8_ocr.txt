NEWS AND NOTES ITE2I3 OF INTEREST BRIEFLY CHRONICLED. DEFICIT TO BE WIPED OUT Custom Receipts Bid Fair to he the Largest for Any Year in the Cus tom Business.. A surplus Will Probably Exist. "If customs receipts continue to come in at the rate they have been coming since June 30, the receipts for this fiscal year will ha the greatest in any year in the customs business of the country, Secretary Reynolds, of the Treasury Department. Up to this time the largest cus toms returns were received in 1903. the tot*l being over $281.000,000. To the end of November this year ous tome receipts have been $124,906,109. against $110,278,693 to the same time last year. Mr. Reyonlds further pointed that not only would the present deficit be entirely wiped out by the end of next June, but there would be a sur plus if customs contine to come in as they have been for the past five months. This is on the theory that expenditures do not grow heavier. November, the fifth month of the fiscal year, closed with a deficit of $12,6ßi,718, against $14.791,387 for October 31. For November receipts exceeded expenditures by $2,129.868. Customs receipts for November were about $2,500,000 heavier than for No vember, 1904. The deficit at the end of November 1905, stands $13.267, 533 lower than November 30, 1904. It is pointed out that the excess in customs receipts since June 30 over customs receipts for the same period last year amounted to $14,627, 416, and that it is mainly because of this excess that the deficit is lower than at this time last year. Internal revenue receipts have run considera bly heavier than a year ago, but the main growth lias been in customs. Mr. Reynolds said today the the in crease in customs this year could he nseribed only to general prosperity and good trade conditions, as each month since July 1 had shown sub stantial increase and the enlarged re turns could not be credited to any one or several lines imports. declared Assisetant »t << » I Diplomatic representatives in Wash ington from Central and South Amer ica countries are manifesting great interest in the possible visit of Secre tary Root to South America next summer, to which place he 1ms an nounced his intention of going if the coming Pan-American Congress is held at Rio Janeiro and the condi tion of public business will permit this absence from Washington.

The report recites that it is understood that there is consid erable apprehension that this will in terfere with the sugar and tobacco in lustries in this country, but the belief is expressed that with possibly one or two exceptions the congressmen who lad the opportunity to study the sub ject first in hand this summer were renerally convinced that there is need less apprehension on the part of the interests that any damage would ob money in am.

He does not be lieve that a man or woman can do a fair day's work if harassed with debts. It has been shown conclusive ly that borrowers of money at 2 per cent per week can not hold up long, and it has also been made public that several of the managers and treasu rers of these money lending concerns have mismanaged affairs, and their friends and families, to say nothing of the stockholders, made to suffer.

BROWN ESTIMATES 10,175,000 BALES AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTI GATION OF PRESENT CROP. A CROP DISASTER PREVAILS States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Ark ansas, Texas and Indian Territory, Show Smallest Crop on Record per Acre. Shortly before midnight last nighty W. P. Brown sen. out the followinw estimate of the cotton crop of 1905 06 and the world's consumption needs : ■ I have recently made a thorough investigation of the present cotton crop, for .be purpose of making an estimate, I have sent inquiries, both by wire and letter, to the very best planters, ginners, merchants and hankers, thoroughly distributed in ev ery cot.on-growing county and parish in the cotton belt, and have also sent out some special agents. Based on tbe information received. I estimate thie 44 year's cotton crop at 10475.000 bales (commercial). This includes this year's growth, linters, city crop, and what old cotton may have been car ried over from last year and marketed into this crop. My estimate by states is as fol << lows: Alabama. Arkansas .. .. . .. 1,125,000 . .. 825,Of !) .... 75,000 . .. 1,650,000 _ 575.000 .. 1 , 100,000 .. 650,000 1,050,000 Florida. Georgia. Louisiana. Mississippi.. .. North Carolina, etc.. .. South Carolina. Tennessee and Oklahoma Ter 575,000 Texas and Indian Territory 2,750,000 10,175,000 Total My investigation shows that we have practically a crop disaster in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, three-fourths of Texas and Indian Territory. Oklahoma, Tennessee and Alabama have fared somewhat bef i ter, though the yield in those states is very light. Georgia, the Carolina? and Florida have good crops, I will say, somewhat above the average, hut taking the belt as a whole I feel sure that the number of pounds of seed cotton produced this year ,per acre, will prove one of the smallest on rec ord. The principal cause for the light yield in the gulf states was aa un precen dented wet spring, which is al ways disastrous to a cotton crop, for the reason that the crop can not he projterlv cultivated. ■ ( i / SIX
