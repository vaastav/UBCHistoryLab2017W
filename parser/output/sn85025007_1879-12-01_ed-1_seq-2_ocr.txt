Trio fir=t rigular session of the 4Gth CoagrOfS omuicaced to day. If its proceedings are to be like those of all pr.vicnssessions immediate !y preceding a presidential cUxtioD, they will bo devoted cl.ii fl/ to purposes calculated to afftot that election, iu this rcspcot it may bethat the democrats 1 a70 the advantage, in that while tho republicans wiil bavo the double duty of endeavoncg to EQ9ke, and striving to avoid lesiog, party capita', the democrats, hav ire lest all that in reason it is possible for then to lose, need bo under no trammels lrom the latter consideration, and C30 coccentrato their efforts entirely upon the former. What the y W3nt now i3 party capital, and their condition is such as will warrant any risk to obtain it. Any change io their prospects must o! ncoossity be for the better. Let them therefore eliminate tho word policy from their vcoibulary, and crediting their constituents with the potsrs tioa of ordinary understanding, propose and advocate a few such measures as oommoD seme and common information teach them will not only bo popular, but whioh must result favorably to tho best interests of tho country. It is not just that tho poor people cf the country should pay a:wost tho entire cost cf the national government, as they are compelled to do by the tariff aDd internal rcveuuo system.'; neither is it fair that the gains of a few monopolists should bo increased at ti e general ex poase, and that the labor cf tho country should be deprived of employment by tho restrictions put on foreign orders by the tariff. Therefore both the93 ryslruis should bo aholith'.d. It wou'd be both just and conducive to the welfare of ibo coanlry if those for tie prct?c'.ioc cf whose property tbu expense of government is knarred, and who aro ab!o to pay r, were com* rolled to do so. Therefore the money for these expenses shoe'd be raised by on income tax. ' Thero is no reason tvhy the people blicull be taxid to pay exborbitaot salaries to luxurious sinecures abroad; thcrofcre the diplotmic servioo should bo abolished. There is neither rhyme nor reason in the oocs'antly rccurrirg bloody and ixpcctdvo lodian wars; therefore tome measure shcu'd be adorted to prevent them. It is mid that resumption <f specie piymoolnha3b.cn oao m pished, and it nray bo so with bankers and brokers, but thero are Ibomanda tf hard workirg and economical men throughout the wholo country whose eyrs have not been gladdrocd with the bight cf gold coin einoe the war; therefore the greenbacks, which must eventually bo redeemed, should be cancried dow. when gold is ff wing into the treasury both from the ru n's ahd from abroad. As Bilver coin it a traditional and really r? useful currency it should he continued as fuch, but its icoonvooionco should bo compensated by its intrinsio vilur; therefore r. bilvcr dollar .should contain a dot':\r'.i w. rtli of ri'.vir. As the 5 res ent g-Deration has bi tnoall tho fluttering nnd hardship incident to t! c orcalion of tho public d iht. and asnolhirg would p'rnso tho oioditora moro than a postpmrmoot 0! tho cfoy Lr iho payment of tho principal rl" that debt, it would bo right ami proj or tor it to bo pea pemrd and bo left to a future generation, upon whom rho settlement wili impose no burden, owing to the comlry'd natural iicrcasc to population acd wealth. Tito Lci.ipti.in ct those and ono or two other mca:-uros like them, cdculated, r.s ail must flto, to promote tii t general wo'hre, may p issibly retrieve tha t rrors tf tho d.uiceratf, being them out cf the n'ough ot despond into which they htvj deliberately walked, and restore them to the oeuGdonoo of the country. A determined and persistent effort to adopt any ono or allot litem eionot possibly plsoo Iho domooraiy in any worse position than it occupies at present. For the good of tbo country, for the prescrvatioi cf constitutional liberty, for the avcidrtci of a chsDgo in iho foim of government and the substitution ci' the oac map power for the will cf tl.c intelligent majority, lot us hopo that the democratic congressmen will eeo too wisdom of thc-sa measures and work hard to huvo them adopted. Tbo President's appointment of Msj. Morgan to tbo presidency of tbo beard of Comaissionors of the District of Coiualr.a will not teed to win him tho spprcbation cf tho stalwart j ridioals, bat will be an cvidecoo to all tho unprejadiocd people t 1" the ccunir/ who knew tbo Major that in some instances at loast tho President is iiflasnocd in meking his appointments by other than partisan motives. Tho Mfjor is eminently cocscrvativo in his politics, and did sabsciibs to the Ohio democratic election fund, but neither is incompatible with bis making a good District Commissioner, and the President. wa aro g'ai to say, w.^ not so bliaded by bia politics as to bo ustblo to see tbo matter in that light, Bod has nfleolod credit upon himself by miking tbo appointment. Had bo been as liberal and cs wise in some of his other appointments he would bavo avoided much of the censure that, ty acting otherwise, ho has justly deservod. Tho President's Message is by no meant: an ablo Stato paper, and bis remarks upon civil sorvioe reform, when cmeidcrcd in connection with his aotioos ia icfercnso to tbo same subieot, and his recommendations respecting tbo freedom of the eleotive frcnofcise, when his oppesitioo to the bill lor preventing tho pnsjneo of eoldiers at the polls is remembered, will striko tho impartial reader as at least remarkable.

On the tufjict of polygamy, tho i'risd.nt says: Utah bus a p.opulaii insufficient Lo entitle it to admission as a b'titc, and the gmural interest of tho nation, as well us tho weil'aro of tho oit ". ics of tho Territory, reqircs its advance from the territorial form of government to tho responsibilities and privileges cf a State. This important change w.ll nor. however, bo ap,proved by tho country, while the citizens of Utah, in very censidcrablo number, uphold a practice which is c.nicmued as a crime by tin laws cf all civil z-d communities throughout the world, lie men bus that the law fur tho suppression cf polygamy has cow Leon decided by tho Supremo Court as to be within tho leg iilative power cf Congress arid binding ts a rule of nc.ion fir all who reside within the Territories. Thero is no longer any reason for dehy or hesitation in its enforcement; it should be firmly and eflcctively executed; it Dot sufficiently strorg in its previsions it should ho amended, and in aid of the purpose io viow 1 recommend that mere comprehensive and inoro searching motheds for preventing as well as punishing tbis orimc bo provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the crjoymcDt and cxtrc sj of the tights and privileges of citiztnship io the Territories cf tho United States may bo withheld or withdrawn from thoso who violate or oppeso the enforcement cf the law on this eacject. Tho elections of Lhc past 5 car, though occupied only with State of5c:rs, have not fiiled to elicit in tho political discussions which attended them all over the country now and decisive evidence of the deep interest which tho great body of eitizeDa take in the progress cf the country toward a mere general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security nnd freedom id the exercise of tho elective franchise. While many topics of political ooccorn demand great attention from our . people, both in tho sphere of National and State authority, I find no reason to qualify tho opin? ion I expressed in mv last annual message that 1 no temporary or administrative iuterestsof gov 1 ernmcnt, however urgent or weighty, will ever < display tho zeal of our people in delcnso of the 1 primary rights of citizenship, nod that tho < power of public opinion will override all political ? prejudices and all seoMonal and Stato attach- t ments in demanding that all over our wide tor- c ?~v> ?

Tho remody suygcsUd by Iho Attorney General is tho r.pPl.inftnQ.a ot additional circuit Judges and tho croalion.cf an intermediate court of orrore and I appeals, which shall roliovo the fcjupremo Court ot a part ot its jurisdiction, v/hiio a larger fcree h r'.eo obtained for tho porforraar.ee ot circuit duties, i e ;mmend Ibis suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would room to afford a complete remedy, and would involvo. in tho appointment of ten additional circuit judges, an expenditure, at the present rale of saisrios. of ml more than .f; U.Ol'J a year, which would corf drily he small in comparison with tho objects to bo attained. Whilo tho recurrences of troubles by tho "White Hivor Ules and Victoria's Indians in New Mexico, in which a comparatively small number of Indians wero engaged, arc most doplorablo, a vsst rm jerity of our Indian population have fully ju3t!?od the expectations of those who bolioved that by humano and peaceful influences tho Indian can bo led to nbaudon tho habits of savage life and. to do vol op a capacity lor useful and civilized occupations. Tho President indorses tho Indian policy akotehod in ticcrotftrv i^clinr^.'o mnnM on.1 "" T ? n a vpwi lutu Ci*J O i. uurii^kj*iy recommend the enactment of a law enabling the Government to givo Indians a titio in fee, inalienable for twonty-livo years, to tho farm lands assigned to Ibem by allotment. I also repeat tbo recommendation mado in my first annual mo&Sfigo, that a law bo passod admitting Indians who c?n givo satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their families for a number of years and who are willing to dolach themselves irom their tribal relations to tho benefit of tbo homestead act, and to grant them patent? containing the samo provisions of inalienability for a certain period- ileforring to his action last spring touching tho movement for tho occupation of lands in tho Indian Territory, tho President s*y3: it is rny purpose to protect tho rights of tho Indian inhabitants of that Territory to tho full extent of tho Kxecutivo power, but it would bo unwise to ignore the fact that a Territory so largo and so fertile, with a population so sparse, and so great a wealth of unused resources, will bo found mere exposed to tho repetition of Buch attempts as happened this year, whea the surrounding States aro more densely settled aud tho westward movement of our population looks still more eagerly tor fresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances tho difficulLv of main. tsinms: tho Indian Territory in its present state will groaUy increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting i; would do well to prepare for such a contingency. I, therefore, fully approve of the advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior to divide among themselves in severalty sii largo a quantity ot their lands as they can , cultivate, to acqu'.ro individual titles in lee in- ! stead of thoir present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the bal- J anco of thoir lands may bo disposed of by tno Government for their bonelit. Ho recommends | that tho decision arrived at at the last session of Congress against a change in tho control of tho j Indian service bo pormittod to stand in order to arrest agitation of the subject. fihorts to arrest the depredations on tho timber 1 lands have been continued, and havo mot with considerable success. A large number of c?ea of trespass have been prosecuted in courts. Others havo been Ec-ttled, tho trespassers offering to ] make p?y*< out lor tho valuoof tho timber taken. , The proceeds of those prosecutions and eottle- ' moots turned into tho Treasury lar exceed in j amount tho sums appropriated for this purpose. J i be destruction ol our public forests by depredation, although such cases still occur, has boon 1 greatly reduced in extent, and it i3 probable that 1 if tho present policy is vigorously prosecuted > ind sufficient provision to that end is made, such ] trespasses, at least those on a largo scale, can bo ] intireiy suppressed, except in tho Territories, j where timber ;cr the daily requirements of tho ] populations cannot undtr the present state of J iho law, ho otherwise obtained. 1, therelore, I sarnsisily invite tho attention of Congress to tho t ecomrner,elation made by tho Secretary of tho ( lnlOiicr. that a 'v" 1 o enacted onr.blir.g tba 1 Ouvcrr.rarr/. to roll timber '.r it. th a iniMie'arda I without conveying tho U*'\ whoro such lands are principally valuable for the timber theioon; such oale& to be so roRulatod s.3 to cor.term <0 domestic wants and business roiuiromonts, vrbilc I at tho sam3 timo fiuvd.-g sgairsta sweeping destruction of forest#. -1 bo enactment of such & law appears to becomo a mere pressing necessity I every day. . . .
