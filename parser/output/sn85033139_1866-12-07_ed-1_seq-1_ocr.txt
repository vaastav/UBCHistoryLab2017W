TOWN AND COUNTRY Our Harbor.—We learn from Mr. Smoke that he is rapidly progressing in his arrangements for beginning the harbor at this place next Spring, having already se •cured 30,000 feet of timber for that purpose. He will be in town next Thursday, ready to award contracts to parties who wish to fur nish stone. Our town authorities have raised a tax of $20,000 for the purchase of anew dredging machine, and are negotiating with mechanics in Chicago for its construction. It is probable they will take the contract for dredging from the United States. Marine. Items. —Although navigation is not closed, the following vessels have al ready made the port of Manitowoc their winter home: Steamer — Xorth- West, “ Planet. Barque —Alice Richards. .Schooner — Addf, “ Byron, “ Experiment, “ Smallotr, Eva M. Cone, “ (Hen Cvyler, “ Anna Thortne , repairing. “ Richard Roe. “ It is probable that more vessels will be llaid up here the coining winter. The schooners El Tempo, Sea Gem, Eb euezer and Sardinia, of this port, are strip ped in Chicago. The schooner Win. donee (whn=e wreck 'we mentioned two weeks ago) now lying at ‘Grand Haven, has been sold to Captain ‘Squired, the owner of the tug S(. Marys, which picked her up, for the sum of SI,BOO. •This is exclusive of a salvage bill of $1,200, but includes about SI,OOO worth of timber in the vessel’s hold. The steamer Comet has been laid up at Milwaukee for the season. The Orion and Sm /tin! are yet making irregular trips between this port and Milwaukee, and will probably continue to do so fora week or two to come. \ new Tin. —Mr. Smoke and other | parties propose to build or purchase a steam I tug the present winter, to be used for har- Lnr purposes, after the building which i she will have enough to do in towing vessels in and out. The speculation will be a pay- i ang one. What the People Want. —We notice that the village authorities arc rc planking the south end of the bridge—a much need cd improvement. Let the same authorities instruct the Marshal to cause the removal of all obstructions from our sidewalks—in cluding ploughs, boxes, barrels, wood, pig pens, ami other rubbish. A timely move incut on their part may save some broken bones to pedestrians, and heavy damages to our tax payors. York street, from Eighth to the Lake, is in a shameful condition, and should be at tended to at once. The property-holders should be ashamed to await the action of any party, for the street and side-walks arc in a pitiable condition. The Weather. —A heavy rain storm on Sunday night and Monday have made our roads impassable— not even jackassable— and as a consequence, our streets arc not over crowded with farmers’ wagons, making business nnn.-unlly dull. Stone, of ihe Island City Timex, has really waked up, and discovered that in a recent little local a.-ticle of ours a comma was left out by the printer. It is a little strange that our neighbor, Tin Horn, Jr., did not get the start of Stone, for those •who know the least about punctuation arc the first to make discoveries of this kind. 

STONE, you’re a “cunning cuss.” •Hibson not Dead.— Our old Iricnd and townsman (the Artist J. S. Gibson) is cre ating great excitement in Milwaukee.

CROWLEY. The North-West. —Col. Ginty, of the Green Bay Gazette , speaks of the new steamer and her builder, as follows : “She is one of the largest steamers on the lakes, and will bo ready for service early next spring. Mr. Hand has the reputation of being one of the best builders the West, and, from what we saw of the Xorth- West, during a recent visit to Manitowoc, his reputation will not be likely to suffer any by this steamer.” Insane. —An insane person, named Chas. Abell, from the town of Schleswig, was brought to the county jail on Tuesday, by Mr. John Barth, Chairman of that town, and placed in charge of Sheriff Glover. Sgk-By advertisement it will be seen that Fechter is prepared for the holidays. He still Lives.— Our friend, John P. Hume, was defeated for Clerk of the Court at the recent election in Calumet county, but notwithstanding his bad luck it seems he lias a host of friends left, for lately he was presented with a ham of fresh pork, a quarter of fat mutton, a plump turkey, several pounds of pork steak, a quarter of a tat hog, and a supply of vegetables. In addition to the above, twelve new subscri -1 hers were added to his subscription list, and a number of delinqi * paid up. If “Hume’s days are nu;u. .cd,” be will not die for lack of fi lends. Wc learn fio.n the Nccnali Times that since the middle of last September to the present time there have been shipped fiom Calumet county to Noonnh over 30,000 bushels of wheat, for which over $50,000 have been paid! The amount brought to Menasha will add to this about one-third.

The Official Vote. —The following is the official vote for Congress in this Distiict, and also flic vote on the Constitutional Convention. It will be seen that the vote j is but 190 more than that of 1804; that j Sawyer received 1,125 more than when he 1 ran before: Sawyer. Martin. Con.

A ForeignThief. —A mannamed Henry Gratcaux lias been arrested in New York, charged with having forged 200 £1 notes on the Union Bank of Glasgow, Scotland. Grateaux was a photographer, and brought with him a young lady employed in his gal lery, leaving behind him a wife and children. Eighteen of the notes wore found in his baggage. He is io custody awaiting ex amination before Judge Newton. The superintendent of the Glasgow police is in New York, asking for the extradition of Grateaux. Sto" Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher, act ing Governor of Montana Tcrritorj*, lately challenged an editor to fight a duel, on ac count of some criticism of the official con duct of the former. The editor refused to fight with leaden bullets, but replied with his pen in such a way that we thing Mea ghcr came out second best, and will not soon be foolish enough to repeat his silly at tempt at duelling. France and Mexico.— A dispatch from Paris to the French Minister at 3Yashing ton states that fourteen vessels would sail immediately from Brest for Vera Oruz, where the French troops in Mexico were re quired to rendezvous for their embarkation to France. Ten additional vessels will leave by the middle of December. By the fifteenth of Januarj-, Mexico will be clear of the French troops. Sudden Death. —We regret to announce that Daniel H. Whitney, Esq., proprietor ot Whitney’s Landing, Ssockbridge, and a prominent and influential citizen of Calumet county, died suddenly of heart disease at Menasha, on the 17th ult Canada.— The whole of the volunteer field batteries in Canada have been supplied with new and complete equipments, guns, carriages, stores, amunition and harness, placing them in a condition to take the field, with effect, at a moment’s notice. — Among those newly equipped are batteries London, Hamilton, Welland, Kingston, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto. Eeported Revolution in Ireland. If the reports from Ireland are anywhere near true, that persecuted country is on the brink of a revolution, which, we pray, may be a successful one. Elsewhere we give stirring news from that country, which our readers must take as it comes. The At lantic cable advises us that many regiments of regular troops, with several war ships of the line, have been ordered from England to Ireland. The London Times thinks that Stephens has effected a landing in Ireland. The advices from Cork, Dublin and Queenstown are to the effect that great excitement and alarm prevails. Detach ments of marines have bean brought to the latter place from Plymouth. The entire Channel fleet has been ordered to Irish waters. The cable advices are more sug gestive than detailed, but no doubt exists that the revolution has finally commenced. The London press are thoroughly alarmed. They say frantically that the rebels be put down, and no mercy he shown. The excite ment in New York and throughout the country is most intene, and measures are taken to assist the cause from this side with men and arms, which should encour age every friend of a long down-trodden country to lend all his power and means to so holy a purpose. According to the latest news, there is no doubt hut that James Stephens is on French soil, glvhg directions for the move ment in Ireland and in this country. His arrival in Paris is known in New York. The present efforts of lii.-htncn to redeem their Isfe has the sympathy of the French Emperor, and it will not be astonishing to learn that Stephens is in clandestine com munication with his compatriots in Ireland at the hands of the French police manipu lated for that purpose. It is reported that notwithstanding the embargo on the cable, a dispatch in peculiar cipher, agreed upon when Mr. Stephens left New York, has been received from the great organizer, containing important infor mation not yet made public, but which will be given it the proper time. It is supposed to relate to the time when Fenian privateers shall start on their mission to cripple the commerce of England. It is also understood that a demonstration is to be made by the Western Fenians in Canada, and a move- j nmnt by the New England Fenians from I Vermont, in the event that the condemned ! Fenian prisoners arc hung. It is said that I Stephens holds the key to the whole move- I ment, and anticipating that the British government would exercise censorship over j intelligence relating to the progress and j preliminary movements, both in Ireland | and in this country, ho provided a success ful plan whereby he is enabled to advise and direct in all important matters. Fenian Uniform. —The new uniforms preparing for the military contingent of the I Irish National organization are now ready j for delivery, and are at once the neatest and 1 most serviceable military dress yet seen.— j The jackets and pants are made ol kersey ! cloth (heavy enough to stand a Canadian j winter), jacket, dark green, handsomely braided, with brass buttons; pants, sky blue, with green cord down the scams ; cap, same as (J. S. regulation, with green band; overcoat, gray, made like U. S. army coats. The whole is handsomely finished, of mate rials as good as the best furnished the reg ular army ; yet, owingto the economy with which is has been got up, it costs only about fourteen dollars. Death of a Prominent Man. —Hon. Cave Johnson, President Polk’s Postmaster General, died on the 23d ult, at his resi dence at Clarksville, Tcnn., aged 72 years. He served fourteen years in Congress, ac quiring a national reputation, and was four years President of the Bank of Tennessee, under Governor (now President) JoKhson' He was, in 1861, elected to the memorial Congress to consider the relations of Tennes see to the Union, which body, however, never assembled, and in iB6O was chosen to the state senate, but was refused the scat, because of aid and comfort he had extended to the rebellion. A Wrong Cook.— The New York Tri bune, mistaking Hon. Isaac Cook, of Chi cago, formerly postmaster of that city, for another Cook, who was a defalter, called him a “full blown knave and a scoundrel.” Isaac sued for libel, laying his damages at 

SIOO,<XK). The case has just received a de cision which gives several points to the plaintiff, though we believe no damages have jet been assessed. It seems that the Tribune is likely to have In pay something for getting the wrong Cook by the ear. Green Bay and Lake Pepin Rail way.—The Green Bay Advocate appeals to the citizens of Brown county to contribute material aid for the construction of a rail road from that city to Lake Pepin. It says the company, at its meeting on Tuesday ? last, resolved to raise $2,000 in money for immediate use. Wabasha guaranteed sl,- 000 in cash, besides SIOO,OOO in city and county aid. The AdtocaU thinks it would be little enough if Brown county gave three times as much. lOU Secretary Stanton has intimated to Gen. Grant that he will retire from the cabinet about January Ist. The news is too good to be tru*' ' f MANITOWOC, WISCONSIN, DECEMBER 7, 1866. Jefferson s Profession of Politcal Faith. Mr. Jefferson’s political principles have ever been the standard of faith with the Democracy of the United States. Nowhere are they more concisey embod ied than in his letter of January 2ith, 1709, to Eldridge Gerry. At a tine when leaders propose to throw princiiles over board for expediency, it is well to go back to the instructions of our old chief. He writes: I do, then, vith sincere zeal, wiih an in violable preservation of our present federal constitution, according to the true sense In which it was advocated by as friends, and not that in which iu enemies ipprehended, who therefore became its enemies; and I am opposed to the monarchisiog of its features by the forms of its admitutration, with a view to conciliate a first transi'; u lIJ ** president and senate for life, and from that to an heriditarv tenure of the offices, and thus to worm out the elective principle. I am for preserving to the states the powers not yielded by them to the Lmon, and to the legislature of the Union Us constitution al share in the division of powers ; I am not for transferring all the Powersoft io sta.es to the general government and all those ol that government to the executive branch. I am for a government vigorous, frugal and simple, applying all the possible savings of the public revenue to the discharge o. the national debt; and not for a multiplication of offices and salaries merely to make p.o tisans., and for increasing, by every device, the public debt, on the principle of its being a public plessing. I a lll for relying, tor in ternal defense, on cur im.iua sorely, til! actual invasion, and tor such a ratal force onlv as may protect our coasts and harbors from such depredations as we have experi enced ; and not tor a standing aimy in time of peace which may overawe the public sen timent; nor for a navy, which, by Us own expenses, and the internal wars in which it will implicate us, will grind us with public burthens, and sink us under them. lam for a commerce with all nations, political connections with none; and little or no di plomatic establishment. And lam not for linking ourselves by new treaties with the quarrels of Europe ; entering that field of slaughter to preserve their balance, or join ing in the confederacy of kings to war against the principles of liberty. lam for freedom of religion and against all rnanoeu vers to bring about a legal ascendency of one sect over another; for freedom of the press, and against all violations of the con stitution to silence by force, and not by rea son, the complaints or criticisms, just or un just, of our citizens against the conduct of their agents. I am for encouraging the progress of science, in all its branches ,and not for raising a hue and cry against the sacret name of philosophy, for awing the human mind by stories cf raw head and bloody bones, to distrust its own vision, and to repose implicitly on that of others— to go backwards instead of forwards to look for improvement—to believe that government, religion, morality and every other science were in the, highest perfection in the days of the daikest ignorance, and that nothing can ever be devised more perfect than wliat was established by our forefathers. Alabama.— Gov. Parsons, of Alabama, in his message to the Legislature ol that State, says what is doubtless true of its peo ple : “Wc are sincerely desirous for a complete restoration of the Inion. \3 e want concili ation, harmony, and national tranquility.- We feel that we have given every evidence which human action can furnish, of an hon est purpose to conform in good faith to the condition of things surrounding us. Ala bama is to-day as true to the constitution and laws ot the general government as any state in the Union. Under the internal rev enue law, and the tax on cotton, the people of this state arc now paying revenue to the general government at the rat? ot nearly ten millions of dollars per year. A Postal Treaty with Great Brit ain.—Postmaster General Randall has finally agreed upon a postal treaty with Great Britain, whereby postages to and from are to be reduced to twelve ccn f s, to be prepaid. The postage is to be collected and kept by the government where the let ter is mailed, and each side is to keep what it gets. This is thought to he an exoccllent arrangement for us. inasmuch as it saves us from paying large sums in gold, the differ ence of the exchange against us in letter transportation, and because wc mail here many more letters than are mailed us for from Great Britain. Change in Fashion.— The announce ment in the fashion plates that ladies' dress’ for street wear are short, and that the crin oline has largely diminished in its cir cumference, will have a feeling of gene ral satisfaction. The long dresses have not only been exceedingly and unneces sarily expensive, but they have been a unisance in the streets, as gentlemen with (he best intentions could not some times avoid treading upon those long trailed dresses. Amalgamation. —The Montpelier Argus says, that, on October 29, a negro 18 years i old was married to a white girl 14 years old, jby Rev. Mr. Adams, the Congregational 1 preacher at Paper Mill Village, N. H., the | bridegroom being Geo. Loord, of Bellows Falls, and the bride Flora Leach, of West minister. It was a runaway match. B®, A teacher is charged with brutally j beating a school boy in West Milford, Mas ! each use tts, on Tuesday. The Boston Trav -1 der states that “it must be admitted that a parent has just cause for indignation when a cut an inch long is made through the skin of a child’s forehead by a heavy ruler in the hands of an infuriated teacher. ’ ’ The Canadian courts have refused to grant the condemned Fenian piPoners a new trial. The President's Message. The second session of the present rump Congress met at Washington last Monday and at 1 o’clock the President sent in hi s Annual Message. It is a very lengthy document, but we give below a correct syn opsis of its important points on the subject of Restoration, Mexican Affairs, Foreign Relations, kc. The message opens as usual with thanks to Providence for peace and prosperity, in the abatement of the pesti lence, and the restoration of civil authority throughout the United States: 

RESTORATION. A review is then to be had of the tacts set forth in the last message, relative to the measures which the executive had taken for the gradual restoration of the Southern States to the Union, such as appointing provisional governors, etc. Only one thing I then remained, the message says, to be I done, and that was the admission of loyal , representatives to Congress. This question was devolved solely upon Congress. In the meantime, the President says, no other plan having been proposed, he continued his effor.s to perfect restoration throughout the judicial, revenue and postal system of the country. The South had also ratified the amendment abolishing slavery, conform- j ed their social laws to the fact, repudiated j the rebel debt, ami proceeded, in good faith, ! to legislate for the amelioration of the col- ] ored race. The President then speaks as 1 follows: “Congress, however, yet hesi- i tated to admit any of these States to repre- I sontation, and it was not until the close of the eighth month of the session that ac hc- ! ception was made in favor of Tennessee. 1 deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus far failed to admit to scats loyal Senators and Representatives from the other Slates, where the inhabi tants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion. Ten States—more than onc-lourth of the whole number—remain without representation. The seats of fifty members of the House, and twenty of them Senate, are yet vacant; not by their own consent; not by a failure of election, but by the refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their admission, it is lettered, would have accomplished much toward the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, and removed serious cause for discontent on the part of the people of { those States. It would have accorded with the great principles enunciated in the Dec laration of American Independence, that no people ought to bear the burden of taxa tion and yet be denied the right of repre sentation. It would have been in conso nance with the express provisions of the constitution, that each state shall have at least one representative, and that no state without its consent, shall be deprived of equal suffrage in the Senate. These pro visions were intended to secure to every state the right of representation in Con gress, and so important was it deemed by the tramers of the constitution that the equality of the states shall be preserved in the Senate, that not even by any amend ment ol the constitution can any state, with out its consent, be denied a voice in that branch of national legislation. It has been assumed that these states, by rebellion, be came territories; but all departments of the government, with great distinctness, refused 1 to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system, and the professed objects of the war. I hroughout the recent legislation of Con gress, the undeniable fact makes itself ap parent that these ten political communities are nothing less than states.” The President then quotes the Critten- ■ den resolution of 1801, on the objects of the war, and reviews the legislation of congress, wherein the states are recognized; and also in Mr. I jincoln’s proclamation. lie then proceeds again, as follows: “In the ad mission of senators and representativesfrum all of the states, there can be no just grounds of apprehension that persons who are dis loyal will he clothed with the powers of leg- j islation; for this could not happen when the constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful congress. Each house is the judge of its own members. A senator or member may be admitted or re jected, or bis credentials referred to a pro per committee. It admitted to a seat, it must be on evidence, satisfactory, that he possesses the requisite loyal and constitu tional qualifications. If refused admission, and sent to his constituents for want of due allegiance, thr-3 r are admonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed in the councils of the nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government, and fidelity to the Union. Upon this question so vitally affecting the restoration of the Union, avd the permanence of our form of government, my convictions heretofore ex pressed have undergone no change, but, on the contrary, their correctness has been confirmed by reflection and time. If the admission of loyal members to seats in Con gress was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and expedient now. If this anamlous condition is right now —if in the exact condii ion of these states at the pres ent time, it is lawful to exclude them from representation—l do not see that the ques tion will be changed by the effect of time.— Ten years hence, if these states remain as they are, the right of representation will be no stronger, and the right of exclusion will be no weaker. The constitution makes it the duty of the President to recommend to the consideration of Congress, such measures as he shall deem expedient. I know of no measure more imparatively de manded by every cootideration of national interest, sound policy and equal jdstfee, than the admission of loyal members from the unrepresented states. It would con summate restoration, renew vi/jor and sta bility, allay doubt, induce emigration, and open new fields of enterprise.” The President concludes on restoration by repeating the warnings of others against a consolidated despotism, and does not make the slightest reference to the pending con stitutional amendment, nor to the touch talked of amnesty and suffrage.questions.— All he says of reconstruction I have given verbatim. 

MEXICAN AFFAIRS. The President speaks As follows on Mexi can affairs; “In the month of April last, as congress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French cxpeditiooiry forte. VOL. B—NO. 20. This withdrawal was to be effected in three detachments —the first of which it tvas un- 1 derstood was to leave Mexico in November, the second in March, and the last in Novem ber, 1807. Immediately on the completion of the evacuation the French government was to assume the same attitude in regard to non-intervention as held by the govern- i mtint of the United States. Repeated assu- ranees hive been given by the Emperor, since the agreement, that he would com plete the promised evacuation within the period named, or even sootier. It wds reasonable to expect that the proceedings thus contemplated would produce a crisis of great political interest in the Republic ol Mexico. The newly appointed minister of the United Stages, Mr. Campbell, Was therefore sent forvard on November Oth to assume his functiois. It was also thought expedient that he should be dttehdcd in Mexico, by the Lieutenant General of the U nited States army, with the view of ob taining such information as might be impor tant to determine the course to be pursued by the ( piled States, in re-establishing and maintaining necessary and proper inter- j course with Mexico. Deeply interested in | the course of liberty and humanity, it seem ed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever inllucnces are possessed fot the restoration and permanent establishment in that country of a democratic and republican form of government. Such was the condi tion of affairs in regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d day of November, official infor mation was received from Paris that the Emperor had some time before decided not to withdraw a detachment of his forces in the month of November, according to agreement ; but that decision was made for the purpose of withdrawing the whole of j these forces in the ensuing spring. Of this i latter determination, however, the United i States has received no notice or intimation, and, bo soon as information was received from this government, care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of France. I cannot forego the hope that France will reconsider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will conform to the existing engagement, and meet the expectations of this government. The documents on the subject will be laid before congress. With the evacuation of Mexico by the French, no subject lor serious differ ence between France and the United States would remain.” OUR 

RELATIONS AVIT.V GREAT BRITAIN. On our relations with Great Britain, the President writes as follows: “It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made towards an adjustment of the difference between the United States aud Great Britain, arising out of the depreda tions on our commerce, and other trespasses committed during the civil war, by British subjects, in violation of international law and treaty obligations. The delay, however, may be believed to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of minis try occurred in that country during the last session of parliament. The attention of the new ministry was called to the subject at an early day, and there is some reason to believe that it will be considered in a becoming and friendly spirit. The importance of an early dispo sition of the question cannot be exaggerated. Whatever might be the wishes of the gov ernment. it is manifest that good feeling and friendship between the two countries cannot be established until a reciprocity in the practice of good faith and neutrahty shall be restored between the respective nations.” THE 

FENIAN INVASION OF CANADA. The President then alludes to the Fenian invasion of Canada as a violation of the neutrality laws and the proclamation winch lie issued, and the trial and sentence of captured Fenians, and says: “Such representations have been made to Great Britain as will, it is hoped, induce | judicious amnesty to all who were engaged in the invasion.” 

CONCLUDING REMARK'S. After referring briefly to the annual re ports, and recommending that the District of Columbia be allowed a delegate in con gress, the President concludes as follows; “In the performance of a duty imposed by the constitution, I have thus submitted to the representatives of the states and the people such information of our domestic and foreign affairs as the public interests may require. Our government is now un dergoing its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is that the peril may be suc cessfully and finally passed without impair ing its oiiginal strength and syramelb*. The interests of the nation arc best to be promoted by the revival of fraternal rela tions, the complete obliteration of our past differences, and the inauguration of all the ! pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts to the accomplishment of these great ends, let us endeavor to preserve harmony between the co-ordinate departments of the govern ment, that each in its propher sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in secur ing the maintenance of the constitution, the preservation of the union and the per petuity of free institutions.
