Carlisle has been in the Laramie Peak country since his escape after robbing the Los Angeles" limited train near Medicine Bow on .Novem ber 18. Letters and telegrams pur porting to have been from the bandit in Denver and other parts of the country were frauds. He made no attempt to conceal his identity. f Frankness His Undoing.

Gayle, chief special agent of the Union Pacific of Omaha, who was in Cheyenne, and a posse was sent Saturday night from Cheyenne by special train. In the meantime, Sheriff Roach had organized another posse and took a train to Dwyer. There the posse obtained teams and drove through a bitter . blizzard to the ranch of Bob Fletcher, at the head of Fish Creelt, on the south side of Laramie Peak. r The snow was so deep it was im possible to go further with teams and the posse proceeded Sunday morning on horseback to the top of the peak.

A diversified program to restore a peace time business status, revise the tax sys tem, curb unrest, reduce the cost of living and rectify labor aud farming conditions was ' recommended by President Wilson today in his mes sage to the new session of congress. The president asked for new tariff laws based on the nation's changed relation to the rest of the world, suggested that the income and ex cess profits tax schedules be simpli fied, advocated steps to improve, rural conditions and promote pro duction and declared for a "genuine democratization of industry" to pro tect both labor and capital. The railroad problem he reserved for a future message and he made no statement of his Attentions re garding the peace treaty or Mexico. Many of his resolutions were the same as those submitted to the spe cial session last spring and several of them are embraced in legislation already being formulated in the two houses. . H. C. of L. Regulation. To meet the cost of living the president asked extension of the wartime food control bill, tederai regulation of cold storage, readjust ment of food transportation and es tablishment of a system of federal licensing for all corporations en gaged in interstate commerce. He declared the causes of unrest to be superficial and temporary and made his only reference to the sen ate s tailure to ramy me peace treaty in saying tnat restlessness was due largely to the nation's hesi tation m determining its peace pol icy. The federal government, he de clared, should be armed with fall authority to deal in the criminal courts with those who promote vio lence. In an extended discussion of labor conditions, he declared, the Workers had just cause for complaint in many matters, and that there should be a "full recognition of the right of those who work in whatever rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision that directly affects their welfare." Against Usurping Power. He asserted that the right of in dividuals to strike must be held inviolate, but added that there must be a firm stand against "the attempt of any class to usurp a power that only government itself has a right to exercise as a protection to all." Finally, he suggested the estab lishment of a tribunal for peaceful decision of industrial disputes. He renewed his recommendation for a buget system of national fin ances, asked for special protection to promote the dyestuffs and chem ical industries and declared the ad ministration bill providing farms for soldiers should De passed without delay. , - The message, about 5,000 words in length, was transmitted to the capitol by messenger, the president expressing regret that his health would, not permit his delivery of it in person. It was read separately in senate and house, where it drew mixed expressions of approbation and disapointment. The democrats generally praised it as setting forth decisively a practical program of re form', while on the republican side there were many complaints that it lacked definiteness and omitted mention of important problems.

TI T- O , , xienry r, apencer, witn neaaquar ters in Washington and chairman of the regional coal committee in Chi cago. Replying to the request for a rul ing on the subject made by Con gressman Jefferis, Mr. Spencer said, that the order of the local fuel ad ministrator refusing permission to Omaha theaters to use kerosene and ether fuel oils for light and heat was unwarranted and that such or der was without the scope of the federal fuel administrator. Congressman Jefferis on receipt of Mr. Spencer's message, wired the Brandeis, Empress and Orpheum theaters, the secretary of the local Musicians union and the secretary of the Stage Hands union, all of whom had petitioned him -to get action, the decision of the coal com mittee on the use of fuel oils.

Stevenson of the musicians' union, conferred yesterday afternoon with the coal committee and urged the point that thefederal fuel adminis tration has not sought to control the use of oils for heating and lighting The coal committee insisted that kerosene' is a "fuel" when used for heating or lighting and therefore the committee would not yield in its or der that all places of amusement here should remain closed. Some of the theater men explained that they could open without using a pound of coal or any electrical en ergy. Reply From Jefferis. Mr. Stevenson received the follow ing reply from Congressman Jef feris: . "Hope the ultimate decision . by central board here sufficient for pres ent. Have Dr. Garfield's assurances the original order not applicable to kerosene, hence jurisdiction does not extend to it." , W. M. Jeffers, chairman of the local coal committee, when shown the information received from Wash ington, replied: "It has no bearing on the situation here." Joy Sutphen, manager of the Bran deis theater, who made a hard fight to remain open by using kerosene, said: "They thought I was bluffing, but I was not. , I told you so."

SUDDEN DEATH TAKES PIONEER IRON MASTER 1 VV'C Jm M V . .A BLHDoes Henry Clay Frick. ' H. . C. Frick, Multimillionaire, Expires Art Collector and Friend of Children. New York, Dec. 2. Henry Clay Frick, pioneer iron master and one of the foremost art collectors in the United States, died suddenly at his Fifth avenue home today in his 70tb year. For three weeks he had been suf fering from ptomame poisoning, but in a statement issued late today; his physician, '! Dr. Lewis Conner, as serted that J.'Mr, Jick for. the ..past month had shown symptoms of an organic affection of the heart, which presumably was the late result of the severe attacks of inflammatory rheumatism to which he was subject in earlier life." Dr. Conner added that Mr. Frick died "in the midst of what seemed to be satisfactory improvement in his condition." Wall Street Shocked. The sudden passing of Mr. Frick shocked' Wall street,' although it had no appreciable effect on stock values. Until the last Mr. Frick detained his interest in business. Once the associate of Andrew Carnegie, and then his implacable business enemy, this master of finance, who from a farm had risen in the world to become possessor of a fortune estimated at $200)00, 000, died less than four'months after the passing of the "Laird Of Skibo." It is probable that a large part of the fortune he amassed by building up the greatest coke business in the world and becoming one ' of the "steel kings'" will be left to the public. Following announcement by El bert H. uary, directing head of the U. S. Steel corporation, that. Mr. Frick's costly art , collections, with his home in this city, would be left to the public, other friends declared he had frequently told them that his children would never be the richest in the world. ' '.' Funeral arrangements provide for a private service at the Frick home Thursday morning, at which Rev. Dj-. Leighton Parks, of St. Bartholo mew church will officiate. The body will be .taken to Pittsburgh . for burial Friday. . ; Friend of. Children. . Pittsburgh, Pa., Dec. 2. Henry Clay Frick was best known to the people here because of his com manding position in the steel, coal and coke industry, but to his in timatev friends- he was known best as the friend of little children. His benevolence in their behalf cov ered a wide area, many of 'them never reaching the public ear. Oc casionally, however, it was neces sary to make them known.' ' It was so in the failure of. the Pittsburgh bank for savings, which was closed a short time before Christmas a few years ago. In this bank had been deposited the sav ings of some 40,000 children, under a plan carried out through the pub lic, schools. When Mr. Frick heard of the failure, he promptly offered to make good every loss on the presentation of the claim at another bank of which he was a director. His. offer was accepted, and the children had their money for Christ mas. U. S. Secret Service Agents Foil Plot to Kill Taft New York, , Dec. 2.

When relating some of the things he had done to help the government, Pignuola made known that an an archistic attempt on the life of President Taft had been defeated.' 

PROMISE ARRESTS OF COAL STRIKERS WITHIN48 HOURS Government Expects to Take Action That Will Solve Acute Fuel Situation. Indianapolis. Dec. 2. Convinced that efforts to bring about a resump tion of operation of coal mines through offers of 14 per cent wage advance to miners have failed and that the injunction issued by United States District Judge Anderson against the strike has been violated, the government has concluded to in stitute contempt : proceedings ' at once, it. was indicated tonight. Federal agents would make no statements, as to when court action might be expected, but it is known that evidence has been collected against alleged violators of the in junction and in well-informed circles it was confidently expected that ar rests would be made within 48 hours. It is understood that the govern ment fias delayed taking action in the hope that some other way out of the fuel difficulty would be found. The injunction, as explained by Judge Anderson, extends to indi vidual v miners, operators or other persons who in any way encourage the strike or interfere with produc tion of coal. Government attorneys, it is said, interpret this to mean that any statement made by miners, or any agreement between two or more men' to continue on strike, consti tutes a violation of the injunction. : Jefferson City, Mo., Dec. 2. Gov. Frederick D. Gardner lias directed Adj.' Gen. Harvey C. Clark to send several companies of the Seventh Regimet, Missouri National Guard, from Kansas City to Barton county, a coal mining centert as an emergen cy measure. General Clark would not say how many companies woula be ordered out,' but emphasized sufficient troops would be sent to control any emer gency that may arise. The troops probably will entrain at midnight under command of Capt. Roger Davis, General Clark said. Barton county adjoins Crawford county, Kansas, center of one of Kansas' largest coal fields, and where disorders have occurred re cently. Governor Statement. Governor Gardner issued the fol lowing statement: "In view of conditions existing in the mining district of Barton county, Missouri, which adjoins Crawford county, Kansas, where dis orders have occurred and troops are now on duty and for the pur pose of . preserving law and order and protecting life and property in the county, I have directed the adjutant general 'to send troops .to Liberal, Minden and other mining points therein. The troops used will be taken from the Seventh Missouri infantry at Kansas City." The governor announced he wold have nothing further to say on the coal situation until tomorrow.

Garfield, United States fuel ad ministrator, a statement which authorizes the operation of. the wartihie priority list in the present coal emergency. The committee has not announced the extent to which Omaha will be affected, but W. M. Jeffers, chairman of th committee, said, 'This order will have the utmost importance on the local situation." . ' ' . "It is necessary that coal shall be used only for essential purposes," Dr. Garfield's order reads. V After a lonz session last nitrht the ccal committee, through" H. L.

The committee has not announced definitely just what industries will first feel the effects of the new or ders. . "We expect to permit the packing plants to continue operating on an eight-hour per day basis," Mr. Sny der said, and he added that he did not believe that food-producing plants in general would be dis turbed. The policy of the committee will be, to directthe Crder first against the least essential industries andl to be guided according to the fuel sit- uation'as it develop, front' day to day. ;. s . .. - "The order specifically prohibits delivery of coal to nonessential in dustries and owing to the steady j, depletion of the 'coal supply it will be necessary to discontinue delivery . of coal to such industries within these terminals," Mr. Jeffers said. Mr. Jeffers however, did not in dicate the industries that he Consid ered as nonessential. Some important announcements are expected to be made today by the committee bn this subject. W. D.

"As far as practicable, until the' conditions warrant a change, the dis tribution of coal will be limited to" the first five classes of the priority list," Dr. Garfield said in hfs order. ' Text of Order. The full text of the Garfield order follows: " - It is necessary that coal shall be used only for essentl purposes. Public. utilities consuming coal . should discontinue- to furnish power, heat and light to non- - . essential industries and should only consume sufficient coal to produce enough lighf, power and heat to meet the actual urgent needs of the people.

Pursuant to this policy I have requested the railroad ad ministration in the distribution of coal now or hereafter in its pos session to limit distribution to these essential, and urgent uses. As far as practicable, until the conditions warrant a change,' thr v. distribution of coal will be limited : to the first five classes of the pri-. ority list.
