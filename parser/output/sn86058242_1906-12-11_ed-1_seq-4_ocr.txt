Several pertinent questions arise in connection witn the President s request th it congress confer upon him the power, upon his own initiative and re sponsibility, to dismiss any officer of the navy whom he thinks unworthy to Jremalu in the service. His complaint concerns naval officers and though in one place ho speaks of "any otlioer," in no place does he di rectly at k the power to dismiss army ou.eei-s. w hy this ambiguity? Or if there be no ambiguity, if, in fact, the message refers to oiUeers of the navy alone, why is it con lined to them? One Of the chief objections that the Presi dent f.nds the law allowing court tnaitlal t;j exercise Mnal authority with respect to naval oilu-ers is that the Xxaval courts ha e no power tho attendance of civilian Put would not the sutuelent reravdy tor this be the conferment of such au thority upon the naval courts? Micht they not be given the power exercised j ty the army of compelling the attend- j aneo of civilians? The army courts! exercise this authority through the fed-j eral district courts. It does not appear' that the courts of the navy could not j exercise it us e:ucie?uly and if need be, t through the same instrumentality. j After all, it may bo that this oonstd-i oration is non-essential.

PROMOTION FOU BELLAMY Di f cussed by to represented. lie did not so then any Pacific coast man who would do. He considered Storer's religion a favorable arset for a cabinet place and would like to have a Itoman Cathoic In the cr.blnet The point In which the cab n':t was weak was in men who were in elese touch with the people, and carried weiphtwhen explaining his pol icies, purposes and acts. Then he takes up diplomatic posi tions and says that he knows of no holder of one of those positions who intends to resign. He says the ap pointment of a Roman Catholic to Ger many or Italy would be a mistake; br.t that difficulty did not exist as to any other diplomatic post. Porter was doing so well In Prance that it would be the height of injustice to turn him that va- or.t. He cioses with the promise if the French post should become cant he would offer it to Storer at once, unless he could offer him a cab inet position. In no place in the letter 1 there any reference to any attack by Mrs. Stor er on any public official, at home or c broad, and Storer's apparent purpose In publishing it is to show that the piesiaeiit was not at ail worried or bothered by Mrs. Storer's anxiety for her husband's advancement.

Storer Says Ireland Can Confirm What He Has Stated. Storer then went on: "The presi dent says 'The assertion that I au thorized him to make such a statement us he says he was authorized to make to the pope is untrue. I gave him no such authorization.' lie omits to note that he himself told Archbishop Ire land that he had done so, and the letter of the latter to me, which I had quoted, I have ready to submit with other letters, of what the presi dent told Archibshop Ireland relative to his message through me to the pope. "lie says and it is supported by Mr. Loeb that he never received my letter reporting in detail my visit to the Vati can. That letter was written and mailed at Meran, within the Austrian frontier, at my first moment of stop long enough to write after leaving Rome. The date is the 4th or oth of IVeomber, 1003, and the letter is; the one referred to by me in my own let ter to the presidut of Jan. 10, 1904, where 1 say 'as I wrote you exactly what I did and said, you may judge whether I overstepped.' It is a pity tho letter In question cannot be found. "The president charges me with 'dis i:genuousness' in the matter of my res ignation in January, 1!XH the one which was refused by him. and says that my resignation was based on an other reason entirely than my going to tic Vatican to convey his message, and Ids treatment of the matter afterward. He had. in the strongest terms, already" forbidden me to refer to that matter, and already forbidden me to quote him again in reference to it. It was there fore quite proper and natural not to speak of it. but pimply to leave it to him to accept my resignation Ou any ground he chose, or on no ground at all, if he saw fit. "The Hurst incident, in which in principle I was right I felt I had been wrong in detail, and was not afraid to say so afforded me a perfect opportunity to tender my resignation without again troubling the president's susceptibilities regarding his messages to Rome. If the word 'Vatican' was not mentioned in my letter of resigna tion the facts were in existence within the knowledge of the president all the same. It was five months only before tho nominating convention, and I was desirous of avoiding any possible embarrassment to Mr. Roosevelt in any way. This now becomes 'particular perfidy' on my part in the view and language of the president of the Unit ed States. As I have already said my original letter is really an answer to everything else that is contained in the president's communication to the press. I ask deliberate judgment on it in reply to whatever he has seen fit to charge upon me and mine." HIS 

AUD1EXCK WITH THE POPE tbo President Letter Sirs. Storer. Storer then gives in full a long let ter from the president, dated Wash ington. Oct. 4, 11X)1, in reply to a let ter from Mrs. Storer, which apparently was a letter urging the promotion of Storer either to another diplomatic po sition or to a cabinet place. The let ter is published, Storer says, to show that his wife's letter "to which this was an answer, now spoken of only with a sneer, was considered differ ently by Mr. Roosevelt at the time it was received." The letter is addressed to "My Pear Maria," and begins "You need never to afraid of writing to me or of ask ing anything." Then he proceeds to discuss the philosophy of appoint ments to cabinet positions; declares Root invaluable, after stating that it is very unlikely that he will make any changes', and that Root's retirement would be really a public calamity.

Secretary Shaw's action in relieving the stringency in thj money market was the panacea for all ills. In consequence the market opened strong and buoyant with prices ranging from one to three points higher than last night's final sales. Canadian Pacific was tho strongest feature on the list, opening live points scoring a new high record in the above yesterday's closing price and history of the road. Tho buying in this stock was again of a high order and it was supposedly for the account of foreign investors who are the larg est individual stockholders in this property. Any t ity of increased dividends or an tional disbursement of stock, they are the first to become cognizant of it. Tho action of the stock during the past ten days denotes something of this nature is more than probable. Of the other high priced railroad shares, St. Paul was the sensational feature. It had a meteoiic rise open ing at 1S4 and selling up to 189. Tran sactions of one and two thousand share lots was of r.o uncommon occur rence. The buying was again of the aggressive sort which was determined j to run the shorts in at any cost. It was also rumored that one of the larger Western operators got caught short a big line of St. Taul and com pelled to cover at a tremendous loss. The same manipulative tactics were pursued in Reading as heretofore. The Prick contingent opened this stock about two points higher, around 152 V2 and proceeded to feed the shorts, all they would absorb any where above 152. Their selling brought about a reaction ot two points irom me eariy high prices. Copper also shared in the general upward movement of prices. It opened around 114 and advanced steadily until it scored an advance cf a point and a half for the day. The buying was of an excellent character. continued prosperous trade conditions is assigned as the cause of the strength in this issue. The market as a whole closed steady and higher with substantial advances discernable throughout the list. morrow: oats, 136; Chieaeo.

Tells Whet He Told His Holiness as from Roosevelt. In the course of an interview bo fore he gave out his statement Stor er said: "In my letter to the presi dent and cabinet I cite letters written by Roosevent to me speaking in the highest terms of Mgr. Ireland and ex pressing the personal wish that the country might profit by his promotion to the cardinalate. Pec. 2. 1903, I had an audience with Tope Pius X, at which I transmitted a verbal note the basis of which had been given me by President Roosevelt. I was particu larlv careful in its preparation, and after transcribing it Into English I translated it into French and conveyed it to the pope. "The communication was as follows: 'He said to me, and authorized me to sav to sav to vour holiness, that the archbishop of St. Paul is his personal friend, and that he possessed his whole co:irkioi:ee as a prelate and as a citi zen: that he earnestly desired for Mgr.
