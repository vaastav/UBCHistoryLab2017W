A resolution Adopted Calling for Information Regarding Pub lic Building Expendi tures at Wichita. Consideration of Section "IT of the Tariff Bill, Covering Earthenware and Glassware, Completed. Mr. Plumb Shows How the Government Saved Money on the Wichita Public Building The Direct Tar and Cotton Tax Consume the i)ay in the House. SENATE. "Washington, Dec 6. A communication from the secretary of state with a certified copy of the linal ascertainment of presi dential electors in Kansas was presented. The presiding officer asked the opinion of the senate (this being an entirely new pro reeding) as to the disposition to be made of the papers whether they should be entered in the journal or placed in the archives of the sen.ite. He added that similar certificates of the states of Mary laud, North Carolina and Georgia had been also transmitted by the secretary of state. After some suggestions, the provisions of the law of February, 1SS7. was found to require the secretary of state to transmit copies of such certificates to the two houses. The letters and comes were re ferred to the committee on privileges and elections. Mr. Sherman moved to refer the papers to the committee on privileges and elec tions and called attention to the novelty of the proceedings. He expressed the opin ion that tiie proceeding, it not an infringe ment of the constitution, wai extra-con stitutional. The constitution nlainly required each state to provide under its oh u laws lor the election of presidential electors and that their action should be certilied to the president of the senate. He doubted whether congress had any au thority to require states to send certifi cates to the secretary of state, but that was a question for consideration. Mr. Edmunds said it was a very simple mutter and that congress in the law of lbs" simply enlarged the degree of security and certainty in regard to the transmittal of these certificates. It was a precaution against the loss of papers or other con tingencies. Mr. Hoar suggested that it was also in tended to have the matter put on record promptly, so that theie shouldbe no tam pering with it under the stress'of political temptation Atter further discussion the papers were referred to the committee on privileges . ami elections. I .Mr. Plumb gave notice that he wouldat I an early da.. ,iaK the senate to consider the Des Moines river land bill. The resolutions tor continuing the select committees on the meat product and the relations with caiman were reported buck from the committee on contingent ex penses and adopted with amendments. Numerous bills were introduced and re ferred. Mr. Plumb offered a resolution, which wis agreed to, calling on the secretarj of luo treasury formrormation as to the ex penditures on the public building at W i eh ltd, Kan The .senate at 1:05 resumed considera tion of the tariff bill, bediming with schedule B, which covers earthenware and glassw.ire, No amendment except as to formal ch.mgfS it phraseology was made to sche.tule 13, and the senate proceeded tothe consideration of schedule C, relating to metals Mr. Plumb called attention to the para graph as to beams girders and joists; spoke of the iron and steel comh nations in this country and instanced the faxs of the government building at .chita, Kan., which had effected a larye wiving by contracting for such work abroad, and of the state house- of Texas, where the savintr he had been informed amounted to 

SJOO, (XK). Ho moved to amend by reducing the rate from 1 1-10 cents per pouud to b-10 cents. Mr. Harris moved to amend the amend ment by lixmg the rate at li-10 cents per pound. . Mr. Allison opposed Mr. Harris' amend ment, waving that it went to the root of whole iron and steel schedule. He had no doubt that if the Dre-sent rate of duty maintained the competition would be snrticient in a very short time to break down the price. The discussion was con tinued by Senators Aldnch, Harris, Hoar, Butler, Plumb and Payne, but no vote was taken on pending amendment and the bill was laid asidt, the progress dur ing the day being about eibt pages. Adjourned until .Monday. HOUSE. Washington-, Dec. 0. The- speaker stated tbat he had received a communica tion from Hon. Perry Belmont, informing Inm that he had sent to the governor of Xew York his resignation as member of congress from the First congressional dis trict of Xew York. The clerk was directed to drop Mr. Belmont's mime from the roll of the house. The resolution for the distribution of the president's message to the appropriate committees was reported from the com mittee on ways and means by Mr Mc Millan, of Tennessee, and adopted by the house. The only debate upon it b?inga sarcastic query from Mr. Geosvenor. of Ohio, as what portion of the message had been referred to the committee on civil service reform and the ouly reply from Mr. Spinola, of New York, that tuat subject could be referred to the Chinese. The order relative to consideration of the din ct tax bill was o modified as to make th- measure a special order for to day, Tuesday and Wednesday next, it Ik ing the de-sirtfof many member thai an 1 adjournment ! taken over Saturday. An eitort wa. mace to reacn mme agreement touching the offenncs and pendancy of amendments, but it proved futile; and without any understanding on thu point, the house on motion of Mr. Caswell, of Wi-cou-in, went Into committee of the whole, '.Mr. Springer of Illinois in the chair), on the direct tax bill. .Mr. Caswell addresd the committee on the bill. Mr. Oates swnt to the clerk's deek and had read for information a venes of amendments which be proposed to otler at the proper time. The first refunds tb cotton tax; the second permit persons who paid that tax to bring suit in the court of claims to recover the amount paid; the third rentes the ncfat of action in the court of claims under the provisions of the captured and abandoned property act, and t& fourth direct the secretary of ;fae treasury, m making payment and set tlement of direct tax to take into account and set off any amount due by any atat to the I"nited States under the act of June 23. ISSfi. Oo regulate ths deposits of public money." Mr. Barne.-, of Georgia, eaid that the purpo- of the bill was to execate a release as to the tax uncollected and to refund the rax collected to the who had paid it. Considered in this statement, of the qutsticn, withocs regard to con- sUtut.oDal principles, tnere m aa -""-rHSce of equity in the rdsie. He I wanted to call attention to the cotton tax. In 1S63 a tax of K cent per pouud was placed on cotton. In 1504 it -was increased to 2 cents, and in 1SG6 it was further in creased to 3 cents and a great bulk of the cotton tax was paid under this last act The direct tax of ISO! was a land tax, a legal tax, a general, a constitutional tax laid in accordance with forms and rules prescribed by the constitution. The tax on cotton was a special tax, an illegal tax. an unconstitutional tax. It was a special land tax on cotton lands of the south. He proceeded to make an elaborate, legal and constitutional argument to show that the tax on the product of the land was a tax on the land itself and he quoted from declarations by the framers of the consti tution to prove that in their opinion a direct tax was a tax upon land and per capita tax ou slaves. If the labor which gave fruit to the laud was to be taxed as a part of the realty, the conclusion was irresistible that the product which was the joint product of the land and labor was a part of the realty. Land was of no value without its product and a tax on the product was tax on the laud. Mr. Caswell inquired wat was the dis tinction between tax upon cotton and the tax upon tobacco. Mr. Barnes replied that there was no distinction whatever. So far a raw, un manufactured tobacco was taxed the tax was illegal and unconstitutional. He did not believe it had e'er been contemplated by the framers of the constitution that the products of land should ever be taxed. It was proposed by the peuding bill to refund the direct tax on account of certain in qualities and yet the gentlemen refused to refund the tax which was clearly an ll lecal. unconstitutional and special tax. a tax imposed on cottftn lauds of the south over and above tho land tax of lStii. Mr Eriloe, of Tennessee, sent to the clerk's desk and had read for information a proposed amendment refunding the cot ton tax and providing that such amount as cannot bo paid to the persons who paid the tax shall be turned over to the school funds of the states interested. Mr. Kerr, of Iowa, said that one of his objections to the refunding of the cot ton tax was that durinu the years when the tax was collected the producers re ceived so lame a price for their cotton that the tax was really to their advantage. Mr. Milliken could see no analogy be tween the cotton tax and the tax which it is now proposed to refund. The cotton tax had been paid. There was no default J about it. If it fell upon one section more than another it was because cotton was I produced in that section. As far as the i direct tax was concerned either those states which failed to o1k-v the law should now come up and pay thetax or the states that did pay It should be reimbursed. Mr. Stewart, of Georgia, regarded the pending bill us unwise legislation. He suggested that were there not a surplus in the treasury the measure would never have been brought up. It was one of the greatest schemes to take money from the treasury and fix the charge of prodigalit ou the Democratic administration, i hero was no public exigency now existiug which could justify congress in resorting to such unconstitutional legislation. Nowhere in the letter of the constitution. nowhere in the spirit was there a word or a sentence to jusitify this vicious legislation, which was nakedly and boldly a gift and donation by the gen eral government. It was fraught with unuger, and as a precedent would prove pernicious. An informal recess for about live minutes was taken to euable Mr. Caswell and Mr. Oates to canvass their respective sides and find some gentleman who desired to speak ou tho measure. Mr. Caswell was Unsuccessful in bis search, but finally Mr. Hooker, of Missis sippi took tuo noor in opposition to me Lflll 1. Ho was not surprised that the gen tleiuan on ther side was prepared to give any reason for advocating the extraordi nary proposition to take from the treasvry back taxes j aid by citizens and distribute them among the several states Pending further debate the committee rose and the house adjourned.
