in fevnr of Tennessee, by the - admission -of bor-Senatow and Kpre sentatives. I deem it a -subject of profound re gret that Congress has thus far faded to admit to seats loyal Senators and Rep resentatives fromr the other- States, whose inhabitants, with those of Ten nessee, had engaged in the rebellion. Ten States more than one-fourth of the whole number remain without rep resentation ; the seats of fifty members in the House of Representatives and of twenty members N in the Senate are yet vacant not by their own consent, not by a, failure of election, but by the refusal of Congress to accept their cre dentials. Their admission, it is believ ed, would have accomplished much to wards the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, and re moved serious cause tor discontent on the part of the inhabitants of those States. It would have accorded with .the great principle enunciated in the Declaration of American Independence, that no people ought to bear the bar den of taxation, and yet be denied the right of representation. It would have been in consonance with the express provisions of the Constitution, that " each State shall have at least one rep resentative," and "that no State with out its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate." These provisions were intended to secure to every State, and to the people of every State, the right of representation in each House of Congress; and so important was it deemed bv the iramers ot the i i;onsuitiuoii uiai uu; truiim.v iM i.n States in the Seuate should be preserv ed, that not even by an amendment of The Constitution can any State, without its consent, be denied a voice in that branch ot the National Legislature. the existence of the States was termin ated by the rebellious acts of their in habitants, and that the insurrection having been suppressed, they were thenceforward to be considered merely as conquered territories. The Legisla lative, Executive, and Judicial Depart ments ot the government have, how- j ever, with great distinctness and uni- j form consistency, refused to sanction an j assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system, and with the professed objects of the war. j Throughout the recent legislation of j Congress, the undeniable fact makes it- j self "apparent, that these ten political j communities are nothing less than ; States of this Union. At the very com- j mencement of the rebellion, each House declared, with a unanimity as remarka- j ble as it was significant, that the war 1 was not " waged, upo.i our part, in any j spirit of oppression, nor fur any pur- pose of conquest or subjugation, nor : purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institu- ' tions of those States, but to defend and j maintain the supremacy of the Consti- j tution ami all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects" were " ac complished the war ought to cease." In some instances, Senators were per mitted to continue i heir legislative func- j tions, while in other instances Repre- i sentatives were elected and admitted to j seats after their States had formally de- j clared their right to withdraw from the ! Union, and were endeavoring to main- ; tain that right by force of arms. All i of the States whose people were in in- : surrection, as States, were included in j the apportionment of the direct tax of ! twenty millions of dollars annually j laid upon the United States by the act j approved 5th August, 1861. Congress, ! by the act of March 4, 1862, and by j the apportionment of representation thereunder, also recognized their pres-1 ence as States in the Union ; and they ! have, for judicial purposes, been divi- I ded into districts, as States alone can j be divided. The same recognition ap- j pers in the recent legislation in refer- ; ence to Tennessee, which evidently rests upon the fact that the functions'of the State were not destroyed by the rebell ion, but merely suspended" ; and that principle is of course applicable to those : States which, like Tennessee, attempted to renounce their places in the Union. The action of the Executive Department . of the Government upon this suiiject has j been equally definite and uniform, and the ; purpose of the war was specifically stated in j the Proclamation issued by mv predecessor .' on the 22d day of September, 18C2. It was then solemnly proclaimed and declared that i "hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be! prosecuted for the object of practically re- ! storing the constitutional relation between i the United States and each of the States and ! the people thereof, in which States that rela- ! tion is or may be suspended or disturbed." j The recognitiou of the States by the Judi- ' cial Department of the Government has also ! been clear and conclusive in all proceedings ! affecting them as States, had in the Su- : preme, Circuit, and District Courts. ! - In the admission of Senators and Represen tatives from any and all of, th States, there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation ; for this could not happen when the Constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Con gress. Each House is made the "judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members,'' and may, "with the con currence of two-thirds, expel a member." "When a Senator or Representative presents his certificate of election, he mav at once be admitted or rejected ; or, should there be any question as to his eligibility, his credentials may be referred for investigation to the ap propriate committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a member, j that he possesses the requisite constitutional i and legal qualifications. If refused admis- j won as a member for want of due allegiance no uuvciuinrai, ann returned to his con stituents, they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be al lowed a voice iu the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and the political power and mor al influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of lovalty to the Government and fidelity to the Union Up on this question, so vitally affecting the res toration ot the Union and the permanency of .FrSren5 na f gvement, my convic exPa, have undergone no change; but, on the contrary, their cor rectness has been confirmed by reflection and time. If the admission of Wl momK Z seats 18 the respective Houses of Congress was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no , "V" xt tins anom- . alaus condition is right now if, jn tue ex - act condition of these States at the psesent time, it is lawful to exclude them from rep resentation, I do not see that the question '1 ue cnangeu ny tne etnux or time. Ten -hence, if these State remain as they are, the I right ot representation -'""S" Hie rie'ht ot exclusion will be nowigv-4'wM.M' ie rigut uiamiiu wi tT? Th" Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President to recom mend to the consideration of Congressf' such measures as he shall jnnge necessary or expe , dient." -I know of no measure more imper atively demanded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy, and equal justice, than the admission of loyal members from the now unrepresented States. This would consummate the work of restoration, anil exert a most salutary influence in the re-fsHhiishment ot peace, harmony, and fra ternal feelm?. It would tend greatly to re new the contidencc of the American people in the vigor and stability of their institu tions. It would bind us more closely to gether as a nation, and enable us to show to the world the inherent and recuperative power of a Government founded upon the will of the people," and established upon the principles of liberty, justice, and intelligence. Our increased strength and enhanced pros-, peiity would irrcfragably demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institu tions drawn from our recent national disor ders by the enemies of republican govern ment. The admission of loyal members from the States now excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would tuni capital, now awaiting an opportunity for investment, into the chaunels of trade and industry. It would alleviate the pres ent troubled condition of those States, and, bv inducing emigration, aid in the settlement ot' fertile regions" now uncultivated, and lead to an increased production of those staples which have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and the commerce of the world. New fields of enterprise would be opened to our progressive people, and soon the devas totions of war would be repaired, and all traces of our domestic, differences effaced from the minds of our countrymen. In our efforts to preserve " the unity of Government which constitutes us one peo ple," by restoring the States to the condition which they held prior to the rebellion, we should b? "coitions, lost, having rescued our nation irom perils of threatened disintegra tion, we resort to consolidation, aud in the end absolute despotism, as a remedy tor the recurrence of similar troubles. The war hav ing tr-minatcd, and with it all occasion for tlij exercise ot powers of doubtful constitu tionality, we should hasten to bring legisla tion within the boundaries prescribed by the Constitution, and to return to the ancient landmarks established by our fathers for the guidance of succeeding generations. "The Constitution which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." " It", in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitu tional powers be, in any particular, wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way in which the Constirution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation ; for "it is the customary weapon by which free Governments are destroyed." Washing ton spoke these words to his countrymen, when, followed by their love and gratitude, he voluntarily retired from the cares of pub lic life. " To keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional powers, and cher ish the Federal Union as the only rock of safety," were prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to endear to his "countrymen the true principles of their Constitution, anil promote a union ot sentiment and action equally auspicious to their happiness and safetv." Jackson held that the action of the j General Government should always be strict ly confined to the sphere ot its appropriate duties, and justly and forcibly urged that j tion ot tins deficiency, however, a special ap our Government "is not to be maintained nor propriation was made by Congress in the act our Union preserved "' bv invasions of the ! approved July 28, 1866. Including the stand- rights and powers of the several States. In thus attempting to make our General Gov ernment strong, we make it weak. Its true j strength consists in leaving individuals and j States as much as possible to themselves; in j making itself felt, not in its power, but in j its beneficence ; not in its control, but in its f protection; not in binding tue States more closely to the centre, but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper constitu tional orbit." These are the teachings of men whose deeds and services have made them illustrious, and who, long since with drawn from the scenes of life, have left to their country the rich legacy of their exam ple, their wisdom, and their patriotism. Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons, j let us emulate them in love of country and respect for the Constitution and the laws. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury affords much information respecting the rev enue and commerce of the country. His views upon the currency, and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue sys tem, internal as well as impost, are commen ded to tiie careful consideration of Congress. In my last annual message I expressed my general views upon these sul.jects. I need now only call attention to the necessity of carrying into every department of the Gov ernment a system of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment and wise economy. Yv'ith no exceptional nor unusual expendi tures, the oppressive burdens of taxation cau be lessened by such a modification of our rev enue laws as will be consistent with the pub lic faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report presents a much more satisfac tory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipa ted. During the fiscal year ending the 30th June, 1865, the last year of the war, the pub lic debt was increased $941,902,537, and on the 31st of October, 1865, it. amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 21st of October, 1866, it iiad been reduced to $2,551,310,006, the diminution, during a period of fourteen months, commencing September 1, 1865, and ending October 31. 1866, having been $206, 379.565. In the last annual report on the state ot the finances, it was estimated that during the three quarters of the- fiscal year ending the 30th of June last, the debt would be increased $112,194,947. During that pe riod, however, it was reduced $31,196,387, the receipts of the year having been $89, 905,905 more, and the expenditures $200, 529,235 less than the estimates. Nothing could more clearly indicate than these state ments the extent and availability of the na tional resources, and the rapidity and safety with which, under our form of "government, great military and naval establishments can be disbanded, and expenses reduced from a war to a peace footing. During the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1866, the receipts were $558,032,620, and the expenditures $520,750,940, leaving an available surplus of $37,281,680. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the 30th June, 1867, will be $475, 061,386, and that the expenditures will reach the sum of $316,328,078, leaving in the Treas ury a surplus of $158,633,308. For the fis cal year ending June 30, 1808, it is estima ted that the receipts will amount to $436, 000.000, and that the expenditures will be $350,247,641 showing an excess of $85, 752,359 in favor of the Government. These estimated receipts may be diminished by a reduction of excise and import duties ; but after all necessary reductions shall have been made, the revenue of the present and of fol lowing years will doubtless be sufficient to cover all legitimate charges upon the Treas ury, and leave a large annual surplus to be applied to the payment . of the principal of the debt. There seems now to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances in population and wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished within the next quarter of a century. The report of the Secretary of "War furn ishes valuable and important informa tion in reference to the operations of his Department during the past year. Few volunteers now remain in the service. 'd they are being discharged as rapidly as V can be reDlaced bv reo-nlar troons.

" The military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by the dteciwrgeSDfVohjpts, the disposti" tion of unserviceable orperishable stores, and the retreffchnient ofexpenditure.

Preparations have been made for.the "payment , of the ' additional bounties authorized during "the recent ses sion of Congress, under -such- regulations as will protect the Government from fraud, and secure to the ' honorably-discharged soldier the well-earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus ; and forty-one national cemetries, containing the remains of 10i,526 Union soldiers, have already been established. The total estimate of military appropriations is $25,205,669. It is stated in the report of the Secretary of the Navy that the naval force at this time consists of two hundred and seventy-eight vessels,' armed with two thousand three hun dred and fifty -one guns.. Of these, one hun dred and fifteen vessels, carrying one thous and and twenty-nine guns, are in commis sion, 'distributed-chiefly among seven squad rons. The number of men in the service is thirteen thousand . six hundred. Great ac tivity aud vigilance have been displayed by all the squadrons' and their movements have been judiciously and efficiently arranged in such manner .as would best promote Ameri can commerce, and proteet the rights and in terests of our countrymen abroad. The ves sels unemployed are undergoing repairs, or are laid up until their services may be re quired. Most of the iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in the vicinity of Philadelphia.:! place which, until decisive action should be taken Congress, was selected by the Secretary of the Navy as the most eligible location for that class of vessels. It is important that a suitable public station should be provided for the iron-clad fleet. It is intended that these vessels shall be in proper condition for any emergency,-and it is desirable that the bill accepting League' Island for naval pur poses, the House of Representatives at its last session, should receive final action at early period, in order that there may be a suitable public station for this class of vessels, as well as a navy-yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service, on the Delaware river. The Naval Pension fund amounts to $11,650,000, having been increased 2,750, 000 durim- the year. The expenditures of the Department for the fiscal vear ending 30th June last were $13,324,526 and the es timates for the coming amount to $23,508, 430. Attention is invited to the con dition of our seamen, and the importance of legislative measures for tiieir relief and im provement. The suggestions in behalf of this deserving class of our fellow-citizens are earnestly reconimeded to the favorable at tention of Congress. The report of the Postmaster General pre sents a most satisfactory condition of the postal service, and submits recommendations which deserve the consideration of Congress. The revenues of the Department for the year ending June 30, l!(Ju, were $14.386, "86, "and the expenditures $15,352-.079, showing an ex cess of the latter of $965,003. In anticioa- ing appropriation ot 700,000 tor tree mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the reve nues yet remaining unexpended, the actual deficiency for the past year is only $265,093 a sum within $51,141 of the amount esti mated in the annual rejort of 1S64. The de crease of revenue compared with the previ ous year wa? one and one-fifth per cent., and the increase of expenditures, owing princi pally to the enlargement of the mail service in the South, was twelve per cent. On the 30th of June last there were iu operation six thousand nine hundred and thirty mail routes, with an aggregate length of one hun dred and eighty thonsand nine hundred and twenty-one miles, an aggregate annual trans- portation of seventy-one million eight bun dred and thirty-seven thousand nine hundred and fourteen miles, and an aggregate annual cost, including all expenditures, of $8,410, 184. The length of railroad routes is thirty two thousand and ninety-two miles, and the annual transportation thirty million six hun dred and nine thousand tour hundred and sixty-seven miles. The length of stcainlxmt routes is fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-six miles, ami the annual transpor- tation three million four hundred and eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty-two miles. The mail service' is rapidly increasing throughout the whole country, and its steady extension in the Southern States indicates their constantly improving condition. The growing importance of the foreigu service also merits attention. The Post Office De partment of Great Britain and our own have agreed unon a preliminary basis for a new Postal Convention, which it is believed will prove eminently beneficial to the commercial interests of the United States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction of the international letter postage to one-half the existing rates; a reduction of postage with all other coun tries to and from which correspondence is transmitted in the British mail, or in closed mails through the United Kingdom ; the es tablishment of uniform and reasonable char ges for the sea and territorial transit of cor respondence in closed mails ; and an allow ance to each Post Office Department of the right to use ull mail communications estab lished under the authority of the other for the dispatch of correspondence, either in open or closed mails, on the same terms as those applicable to the inhabitants of the country providing the means of transmission. The report of the Secretary of the Interi or exhibits the condition of those branches of the public service which are committed to his supervision. During the last fiscal year, four million six hundred and twenty-nine thousand three hundred and twelve acres of public land were disposed of, one million eight hundred and ninety-two thousand five hundred and sixteen acres of which were en tered under the homestead act. The policy originally adopted relative to the public lands has undergone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not their rapid set tlement, was the cardinal feature of our land system. Long experience and earnest dis cussion have resulted in the conviction that the early development, of our agricultural re sources, and the diffusion of an energetic population over our vast territory, are ob jects of far greater importance to the nation al growth and prosperity than the proceeds of the sale of the land to the highest bidder in open market. The pre-emption laws con fer upon the pioneer who complies with the terms they impose the privilege of purchas ing a limited portion of " nnof&red lands" at the minimum price. The homestead en actments relieve the settler from- the pay ment of purchase monev, and secure him a permanent home, upon the condition of resi dence for a term of years. This liberal poli cy invites emigration from the old, andirom the more crowded portions of the new world. Its propitious results are undoubted, and will be more signally manifested when time shall have given to it a wider development. Congress has made liberal grants of pub lic land to corporations, in aid of the con struction of railroads and otlwr internal im-jmprovements..- Should this policy hereafter prevail, more stringent provisions will be required to secure a faithful application of the fund. The title to the lands should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but remain ii th Gvrnmant a.nd jubject to its control until some portion of the road has been actu- then-. t . ,, from time tr. Hnifi beeonvevod tothecorpo- from time to time, beconveyjd to the corpo ration, but never in a greater ratio to tne whole qtrant ity embraced by . the grant than the completed parts bear to the entire length of the projected improvement. This res triction would not operate to the prejudice of any undertaking conceived in good faith and executed with " reasonable energy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw from mar ket the lands falling within the operation ot such grants, and thus to exclude the incep tion of a subsequent adverse right. A breach of the conditions which Congress may deem proper to impose should work n forfeiture of claim to. the lands so withdrawn but uncon veyed, ami of little to the lands conveyed which remain unsold. Operations on the several lines of the Pacific Railroad have been prosecuted with unexampled vigor and success. Should no unforeseen causes of de lay occur, it. is confidently anticipated that this great thoroughfare will bo completed before the exphation of the period designa ted by Congress. Duiing the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners, including the expeuses of disburse ment, was thirteen million fourlinudred andflity nine thousand nine liundred and ninety-six dol lars ; and fifty thousand one hundred and seventy seven names were added to tUepension rolls. The entire number of pensioners, June 30, ISOfi, was one hundred and twenty-six thousand seven huiv dred and twenty-two. This tact furnishes melan choly and striking proof of the sacrilicua made to vindicate the constitutional authority of the Fed eral Government, and to maintain inviolate the integrity of the Union. They impose upon us corresponding obligations. It ia estimated that thirty-three million dollars will be required to meet the exigencies of tUis branch of the service during the next fiscal year. Treaties have been coneluded with the Indians who, enticed into armed opposition to our Gov ernment ut the cut break of the rebellion, have unconditionally submitted to our authorijy, and manifested an earnest desire for a renewal of friendly relations. During the year ending September SO, 1866, eight thousand seven hundred and sixteen patents lor useful inventions and designs were issued, and at that date the balu.iee in the Treasury to the credit of the Patent fund was two hundred and twenty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety seven dollars. As a subject upon which depends nn immense amount of the production and commerce of the country, I recommend to Congress such legisla tion as" may he necessary Tor the preservation of the levees of the Mississippi river. It is a mutter of national importance that early steps should be taken not only to 'add to the efficiency of these barriers against destructive inundations, hut lor the removal of all obstructions to the free and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce. The District of Columbia, nndcr existing laws, is not entitled to that representation iu the Na tional Councils which, from our earlist history, has been uniformly accorded to each Territory established from time to time within our limits. It maintains peculiar relations to Congress, to whom the Constitution has granted the power of exercising exclusive legislation over the seat of government. Our fellow-citizens residing in the District, whose interests are thus confided to the special guardianship of Congress, exceed in num ber the population of several of our Teriitories, and no just reason is perceived why a delegate of their choice should not he admitted to a seat iu the House of Kcnresentatives. No mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling them to make known their peculiar condition and wants, and of securing the local legislation adapted to them. I therefore recommend the passage ot a law authorizing the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a delegate, to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a delegate repre senting a Territory. The increasing enterprise and rapid progress of improvement in the District are highly gratifying, and I trust that the efforts of the municipal authorities to promote the pros perity of the national metropolis will receive ttie efficient and generous co-operation of Congress. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture reviews the operations of his Department during the past year, and asks the aid of Congress in its efforts to encourage those States which, scourged by war, are now, earnestly engaged in the re organization of domestic industry. It is a subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations against our domestic peace and safety, or our legitimate influence aniQiig the na tions, have been formed or attempted. While sentiments of reconciliation, loyalty, and partiot lsm have increased at home, a more just consid eration of our national character and rights has been manifested by foreign nations. The entire success of the Atlantic Telegraph between the coast of Ireland and the Province of Newfoundland, is an achievement which has been justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the open ing ot an era iu the progress of civilization. There is reason to expect that equal success will attend, and even greater results follow, the enterprise for connectingthe two Continents through the Pacilic Oeean by the projected line of telegraph between Kamseliatka uud the Russian possessions in America. The resolution of Congress protesting against pardons by foreign Governments of ersons con victed of infamous offences, on condition of emi gration to our country, has been communicated to the States with which we maintain intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject of com plaint on our part, has not been renewed. The congratulations of Congress to the Empe ror of Russia, upon his escape from attempted assassination, have been presented to that hu mane and enlightened ruler, aud received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation. The Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish-American adventurers to induce the emigra tion of freedmenof the United Mates to a foreign country, protested against the project as one which, if consummated, would reduce them to a bondage even more oppressive than that from which' they have just been relieved. Assurance has been received lrom the Government of the State in which the plan was matured, that the proceeding will meet neither its encouragement nor approval. It is a question worthy of your consideration, whether our laws upon this sub jeet are adequuie to the prevention or punish ment of the crime thus meditated. In the month of April "last, as Congress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President of the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary military forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in three detach ments, the first of which, it was understood, would leave Mexico In November, now past, the second in March next, aud the third and last in November, lSbT. Immediately upon the com pletion of the evacuation, the French Govern ment was to assume the same attitude of non intervention, in regard to Mexico, as is held by the Government of the United States. Repeated assurauees have been given by the Emperor, since that agreement, that he would complete the promised evacuation within the period men tioned, or sooner. It was reasonably expected that the proceed ings thus contemplated would produce a crisis of great poliiical interest in the Republic of Mexi co. The newly-appointed Minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore sent for ward, on the 9th day of November last, to as sume his proper lunctions as Minister Plenipo tentiary of the United States to that Republic. It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in the vicinity ot Mexico by the Lieu tenant-General of the Army of the United States, with the view of obtaiuing such information as mi"ht be important to determine the course to be"pursued by the United States in re-establishing and maintaining necessary and proper inter course with the Republic of Alexico. Deeply in terested in the cause of liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever influence we possessed for the restora tion and permanent establishment in that coun try of a domestic and republican form of govern ment. Such was the condition of affairs in regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d of November last, offi cial information was received from Paris that the Emperor of France had some time belore deci ded not to withdraw a detachment of his forces in the month of November past, according to en gagement, but that this decision was made with the purpose of withdrawing the whole of those forces in the ensuing spring. Of this determina tion, however, the United States had not received any intimation ; and so soon as the information was received by the Government, care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of France. 1 cannot forego the hope that France will re consider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will conform as nearly as practicable with the exist ing engagement, and thus meet the just expecta tions of the United States. The papers relating to the subject will be laid before yon. It is be lieved that, with the evacuation of Mexico by the expeditionary forces, no subject for serious dif ferences between France and the United States would remain. The expressions of the Emperor and people of France warrant a hope that the traditionary friendship between the two countries might in that case be renewed and permanently restored. ... ....,, A claim of a citizen of the United States for indemnity for spoliations committed on the high seas by the French authorities, in the exercise of a belligerent power against Mexico, has been met by the Government of France with a proposition to defer settlement nntil a mutual convention for th adjustment of all claims of citizens and sub jects of both countries, arising out of the recent Wars On IDIa cuuwucul, biiuu uu Hrccu uijuii u v the two countries. The suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but it belongs to Congres to direct th manmr in which claiinkindemnity by foreign ers, as well as by citizens of the United States, arising out of th late vil wiuvhall bt adjudi-,, cated and 'determined.' ' I have-no doubt that the subject of all such claims will engage your atten tion at a convenient and proper time. j -It Is amatterof regret that no-considerable ad-: vauce has been made towards an adjustment of the -difftrences between the United States and Great Britain, arising oat ot the depredations up on our national commerce and other trespasses committed during our civil war by British sub jects, In violation or international law and treaty obligations. The delay, however, may be be lieved to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred in that country du ring the last session of Parliament.' The atten tion ol the new ministry was called to the subject at nn early day, and there is some reason to ex pect that it will now be considered in a becoming and friendly spirit. The importance of an early disposition of the question cannot be exaggera ted. Whatever might be the wishes ot the two Govern menU, it is manifest that good-will and frendship between the two countries cannot be established until a reciprocity, iu the practice of good-laith and neutrality, shall be restored be tween the respective nations. On the 6th of June last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military expedition and enter prise against the British North American Colonies was projected and attempted to be carried on within the territory and jurisdiction of the Uni ted States. In obedience to the obligation im posed upon the Executive by the Constitution, to see that the laws are faithfully executed, all citi zens were warned, by proclamation, against ta king part in or aiding such unlawful proceedings, and the prjper civil, military, and naval officers were directed to take all necessary measures for the enforcement of the laws. The expedition failed, but it it has not been without its painful consequences. Some of our citizens who, it was alleged, were engaged in the expedition, were captured, and have been brought to trial, as for a capital offence, in the Province of Canada. Judgment and sentence of death have been pro nounced against some, w hile others have been ac quitted. Fully believing in the maxim of gov ernment, that, severity of civil punishment for misguided persons who have engaged in revolu tionary attempts which have d'tsastrousliy wiled, is unsound and unwise, such representations have been made to the British Government, in behalf of the convicted persons, as, being sustained by an enlightened aud humane judgment, will, it is hoped, induce in their cases an exercise of clem ency, and a judicious amnesty to all who were en gaged in the movement. Counsel has been em ployed by the Government to defend citizens ot the United States on trial for capital offences in Canada ; and a discontinuance of the prosecu tions which were instituted in the courts of the United States against those who took part in the expedition, has been directed. I have regarded the expedition as not only po litical iu its nature, but as also in a great measure foreign from the United States in its causes, character, and objects. The attempt was under stood to be made in sympathy with an insurgent party in Ireland, aud, by striking at a British Province on this Continent, was designed to aid in obtaining redress for political grievances which, it was assumed, the people of" Ireland bad suffered at the hands ot the British Government during a period of several centuries. The persons engaged in it were chiefly natives of that country, some of whom had, while others had not, become citizens of the United :;t:acs under our general laws ol naturalization. Complaints ot misgovernment in Ireland continually engage the attention of the British nation, and so great an agitation is now prevailing in Ireland that the British Government have deemed it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in that country. These circum stances must necessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have entertained in re gard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as thost laws remain upon our statute-books, they should be faithfully executed, aud if they operate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively. Congress alone can apply the remedy, by their modification or repeal. Political and commercial interests of the Uni ted States are not unlikely to be affected in some degree by events which are transpiring in the eastern regions of Europe, aud the time t-ccius to have come when our Government ought to have a proper diplomatic representation iu Greece. This Government has claimed for all persons not convicted, or accused, or suspected of crime, an absolute political right of self-expatriation, and a choice of new national allegiance. Most of the European States have dissented from this principle, aud have claimed a right to hold such of their subjects as have immigrated to, and been naturalized in, the United States, and afterwards returned on transient visits to their native coun tries, to the performance of military service in like manner as resident subjects. Complaints arising from the claim in this respect uuide by foreign States, have heretofore lveen matters f controversy between the United States and some of the European Powers, and the irritation conse quent upon the failure to settle this question in creased during the w'ar in which Prussia,. Italy, and Austria were recently engaged. While Great Britain has never acknowledged the right of expatriation, she has not practically in sisted upon if. France has been equally 'orbcar ing; and Prussia has proposed u compromise, which, although evincing increased liberality, has not been accepted by the United States. Peaae is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the present seems to be a favorable time for an asser tion by Congress of the principle, so long main tained by the Executive Department, that naturalization by one State fully exempts the native-born suoject of any other State from the performance of military service underany foreign Government, so long as he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits. In the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution, I have thus submitted to-the Representatives of the States and of the Peop'e such information of our domestic and foreign af fairs as-the public interests seem to require. Our Government is now undergoing its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is, that the peril may be successfully and finally passed, without impairing its original strength and symmetry. The interests of the nation are best to be promot ed by tne revival of fraternal relations, the com plete obliteration ot our past differences, and the reiuauguration of all the pursuits of pence. Di recting ouretforts to the early accomplishment ot these great ends, let us endeavor to preserve har mony between the co-ordinate Departments of the Government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate w ith the other in secur ing' the maintenance of the Constit-ation, the pre servation of the Union, and the pe rpetuitv of our free institutions. 

ANDREW JOHNSON. Washington, December o, 1S66.. A Penitentiary. Gov. Worth, in his late Message to the Legislature, recommends the building of a Penitentiary in this State. Our opinion about the matt;r will not influ ence the action of the Legislature one way or the other, but we merely w: int to say that we do not agree with the Governor. First, we are opposed to this scheme be cause it will require a larger amount of mon ey to erect the buildings an d put the estah lishment in operation than the people can spare in their present impoi erished condi tion. The Governor acknowledges that the people are barely able to pay their present taxes, and many are entirely unable to pay their debts, yet he makes recommendations that will certainly increase taxation. Second, we are opposed to building a Pen itentiary because we think it will increase crime by diminishing the terror of our pres ent modes of punishment to evil doers. There are thousands of wortl l'ess characters who have no visible habitath n or means of making a living, and who wo uld not fear to commit crime if they knew th:t confinement in the Penitentiary, where they might learn a trade and get well fed and clothed, was the only punishment to be inflict ed. Hang ing and whipping are the best m '-ans to di minish crime and lessen the numb -er of evil doers. Third, we are opposed to bringi ng crimi nal or pauper labor into competition with our honest, respectable mechanics. If a Pen itenitary was erected, ot course vadous me chanical branches would be carriet on, and the work wotdd be thrown on the i narket in competition withjhat of a highly u seful and respectable class of our population the me chanics. If the State goes into the business of learning criminals trades and the manu facture of harness, saddles, boots, shoes, fcc., our present class of mechanics who manufac ture such articles would soon be obliged to quit their trades and go at something else to support themselves and families. Fourth, we do not think the Legislature ought to sauction the recommendation, be cause the question has heretofore been sub mitted to the people and an overwhelming majority voted against a Penitentiary. Besides the expenses of erecting the build ings, purchase of machinery, &c. it woald. require a heavy annual appropriation for a few years at least to keep the establishment, up. It is very doubtful whether it would, ever pay expenses. Charlotte Democrat. Petitions are circulating among friends of Gov. Wells, of Louisiana, requesting Con gress to establish provisional governments an. the Southern States until the full readxuis sion of the States.

Mr. McDougal objected to it, as out of order. The President so decided. A message was received from the House of Rep resentatives announcing that it had organized, aud that a committee of three had been appointed to act with a similar committee of the Seuate, in informing the President of the United States that they were organized, and ready to proceed to business. tin motion of Mr. Trnmbnll, the Senate then took a rceess till half past 1 o'clock.

Precisely at 12 o'clock, Speaker Col fax, called the House to order. Rev. Dr. Boynton, the Chaplain, then made a brief prayer, in which he invoked the Divine blessing upon Congress, npon its proceedings aud upon all the high officers of the Government, the President included, and prayed that God would so direct all who have any influence over the destinies of the country, as that harmony between all departments ot the'Nationai Government might result ; not such harmony as might be had by the yielding of the right, but only such harmoti3' as comes by the yielding of those who are iu the wrong. The members of the Tcumtssee Delegation not admitted before, were then admitted Mr. Washburne, of Illinois, offered a resolution that the Speaker appoint a committee to wait upon the Senate aud announce that a quorum of the House had assembled, and also that a com mittee be appointed to join the Senate Commit tee and to wait upon the President and announce that Congress was ready to receive any communi cation that he might be pleased to make.

On motion of Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, a resolution was adopted directing the Secretary of State to lay before the House a"l correspon dence had by the State Department relative to the discovery and arrest of John II. Snrratt. Mr. Boutwell introduced, for reference, a bill to provide lor the sale of gold by directing the Secretary of the Treasury to sell Si00r000 of gold every Monday morning in New York in parcels not to exceed 10,000 each, and providing that no sale ot gold be made in any other way, and that no such sale shall be made when the amount of gold in the Treasury does not exceed $2,000,000'; also, that public notice of the time and place of such sale shall be given in one newspaper in each of the twelve principal cities of the United States. Also, providing that the Secretary may allow a commission to the person making such sales not toexceed one-fifth of one per cent, of the amount sold. Also, that the Secretary shall. irom time to time, invest tue proceeds ot such sales in interest bearing bonds ol the United States, and that the bonds so purchased shall be marked negotiable, and the interest thereon shall be in vested in other bonds to be held and treated in the same measure. The 4th section provides that im collector of Internal Revenue or other public officer, shall deposit the funds of the United States in any banking institution, whenever his office or place of business is within two hundred miles of the Treasury of the United States; or of an Assistant Treasurer, or of any designated depository of the public money. The bill was referred to the com mittee on Vays and Means. Mr. Schenek, of Ohio, introduced a bill to fix the times for the regular meetings of Congress at 12 o'clock, noon, on the day on which the term begins, the first Monday in January, and on the second Monday in November, next preceding the end of the term for which the Congress is elect ed.

Mr. Sumner gave notice he will to-morrow introduce resolu tions declaring the power of Congress on the sub ject ot reconstruction, and the right to exclude the late rebellious States from Congressional rep resentation and from voting on constitutional amendment. Mr. Chandler moved, but the Senate refused, t take up House bill repealing the act authori zing the President to issue proclamation of am nesty fec. Adjourned. House op Representatives. The Honse of Representatives to-day adopted a resolution in quiring into the expediency of repealing the cot ton tax. Mr. Broomall, of Pa., also ofTered a reslontion which was adopted by a vote of 107 to 87, in structing the committee on territories to inquire into the propriety of extending territorial or ganization over the States lately in insurrection. On motion of Mr. Stevens, of Pa., a resolution was adopted for the appointment of a committee of five to examine into the relations between the government and Southern Railroad Companies. The joint committee on reconstruction is re vived. The House committee on the judiciary have re ported against repealing so much of the confisca tion act as prohibits the forfeiture of the real estate of the included classes, beyond the term of their natural lives. They say to forfeit altogether the property of those engaged in the late rebell ion would be the enactment of ex post facto law within the meaning of the constitutional inter diet, by annexing to u crime already committed a new and additional punishment. The tone and temper of Congress, as exhibited in the speeches at the public welcome yesterday, and by the proceedings of both Honses thus far, are deeidcly radical. Another indication of this is the nearly unanimous adoption of the resolu tion, directing inquiry into the propriety of ex tending territorial governments over the South ern States. It is probable that a caucus of Senators will re move Mr. Doolittle from the ChairmanshiD of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Mr. Cowan, from Patents, and Mr. DixonJrom Post Office. RlSTOKI AT THE

This important document will be found in our paper to-day. It is a calm, able, dispassionate State pa per. The President reiterates Lis adhere- to his plan of restoration, as it was cxnertA he would do, but he does so with fcat def- ciciHJu auu ivspcct lor me congress, lip gards that body as eminently constitutionni re- M.uaM:i. auuev iueuuy seems disposed to leave the whole subject of restoration injt8 hands. ; IoTthis he differs from Gov. Wortl who in his message characterized the Con' gress as an unconstitutional body. The message conf aius gratifying statements in relation to the finances, our foreign affair and the "-wonderful progress the country is making in population, prosperity, and wealth. The message has fallen like a wet blanket on the hopes of Southern malcontents and traitors. They looked for a 1mU1 attack on the Congress, and for expressions on the sub ject of loyalty which would relieve and ben efit them. They expected defiance for the Congress, whereas they see only deference nd respect. They are sorely disappointed Their last prop is giving way. Or, to change the figure. Andrew Johnson is shaking his skirts, and they are dropping off into the dark profound. They feel that their doni is scaled. The loyal millions of the North have spoken, and President Johnson could not help them longer, if he would. The people, speakfng through the Congress, will speedily settle all our difficulties on a thor oughly loyal basis. Not Trne to the Souti." The Senior of the. SejUincl havin" com plained that J. J. Gntkrie, Jr., Esq,of the Progress, Agent of the Associated Press, had not sent to him s copy of the President's Message as promptly as he expected it, 3Ir. Guthrie, after explaining the matter natis faetorily, makes this " ten strike" at the Se nior aforesaid .- " SiacetneEditor of the SrHtwelis pleased to couple the name of the Progres with that of the iitandttrd, I win remind ftim for his sake and the information o4' the public, that I, my brother and father, sacrificed good prospects in Washington, to battle in the cause of Southern independence, and all three of us were in the military service, when he was engaged, during-the existence of the Confederacy, writing articles host i re to the cause of the South, for the editorial columns of the Raieigh Standard." Every word of the above is true : Mr. Pell was as " hostile tt the cause of the South" as ne couici be, up to the fall of 186a This charge upon the Senior is, ra3 he would say, especially damaginf. The Senior does not care how many fibs are tokl upon him ; but the truth, as in this case, is more than he can bear. Mr. Pool was defeated, according to the Sentiitet, because he "embarrassed the Con federacy" in 1864. Mr. Pel) did the same thing in I8601, and the Progi-ess has cliargcd the fact upon him. Mr. Pell is not "true to the Sooth." He is simply an impostor. He onght not to enjoy any favors at the hands of this true blue Southern rights Legislature. Let him act honestly in this business by re signing his State Printership and setiiing to private life. It is clear that he obtained the office by false pretences, as this Legislature is too u trne to the South" to have elected any one knowingly, who was " hostile to the cause of the South" doring the rebellion. Congres. We give to-day a summary of the proceed ings of Congress on Monday and Tuesday. It will be seen that that body has made a good beginning. The " axe has been laid at the root of the tree" of secession and trea son, and we trust it will be taken up and used, until the tree, and even the roots, shall have been extirpated. It has cumbered the ground" too long already. ' ,' ' The tone of Congress, we are : rejoiced to see, is eminently national. We trust this tone may be maintained, and that suitable action may result from it. There are no trner Unionists than those of the South. We trust onr Northern friends and the Congress will bear this fact in mind. It was an easy and a profitable thing to be a Union man in the Northern States during the rebellion ; but Southern Unionists had to maintain their principles and they did maintain them against the bayonet, the dungeon, and oppressions and contumely of all kinds. Traitors are " demanding their rights." Loyal men only a&k . for protection and for permanent civil government m a loyal basis. It can not be that a loyal and patri otic Congress will disregard this request. m m B. P. Williamson & Co., as will be seen by reference to their advertisement in to-day's Standard, will hold one of their great trade sales at Auction, on Tuesday the 11th inst. The attention of the trade and the public is specially called to this sale. Moreover, the condition of the finances of the country and the complication of our Eu ropean difficulties, look to a probable conflict, which may restrain the wrath of our ene mies. Sentinel. The report presents a much more satisfac tory condition of. our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipa ted. President Johnson's late Message. It is a subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations against our domestic peace and safety, or onr legitimate influence among the nations, have been formed or at tempted. President Johnson's late Meszage. m m Gkapes. A writer in the Eastern part ot this State to the Petersburg Express, says : In Chowan county I met with Mr. Cherry and Jos. Cannon, two of the largest growers of grapes in this part of North Carolina. It is said that Mr. Cannon was offered $12,000 for his grapes, the purchaser to gather them. While I do not credit the report, it is very apparent that the cultre of the grape is the most lucrative business that our people can pursue. In the district of Columbia apiece of land was pointed out to me that was thea set out in vines. It wa3"very poor, situated on the side of a hill, and yet the purchaser gave $1,000 per acre for it. . The first crop of grapes showed the good sense and sound judgment of the vintner, and proved remun erative, i ar better lands can be bougni i North Carolina for $5 an acre, and our soil is the natural home of the grape. Amateurs may be gratified to know that Mr. Cannon has a new variety of grape, which be pro nounces the best in the world,or at least the best that he has ever seen. It is called the Mish grape. The demand for it is very great, far exceeding the supply. I think it is a na tive seedling. . .
