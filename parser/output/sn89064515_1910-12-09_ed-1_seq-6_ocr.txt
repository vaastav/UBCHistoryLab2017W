FORCAN'AL FORTIFICATIONS 8even Millions Wanted for Immediate Use, but the Total Cost Will Be in the Neighborhood of Twenty Mil lions-7-Aggregate Appropriations Re­ quested for Isthmian Service Exceed Fifty-six Millions. Washington, Deo. 7.—Tbe estimates of appropriations required for ©very branch of the federal government dur­ ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1912, aggregating $748,414,861, were submitted to congress by Secretary of the Treasury MacVeagh. This grand total stands against estimates of $745, 067,197 and appropriations of $805,294,-: 613 for the current fiscal year, which appropriation included over $10,000,000 for the census, over $10,600,000 for the postal and other deficiencies. A lump appropriation of $1,000,000 is asked to enable the secretary of the navy to establish at such places as he may deem suitable depots for coal and other fuel for the supply of warships. There is a $100,000 increase for the Alaska-Canada boundary work and $87,000 for enforcement of the insecti­ cide act. There are many items of ap­ propriations needed for public works of various kinds, aggregating $28,848, 399 civil and $94,419,959 under the war department. For the defense of the isthmian ca­ rnal the estimates ask $7,000,000, to be immediately available, and ask author­ ity for $19,546,843 in all for this forti­ fication project, with a view to com­ pletion within three years.

The total rivers and harbors esti­ mates for the work during the next fiscal year aggregate $22,627,301, against $41,339,113 appropriated for the same purposes during the current fiscal year. LITTLE HOPE OF ENACTMENT Measures Recommended to Congress by the President. Washington, Dec. 7.—Congress gave respectful attention to President Taft's message, but there were comparative­ ly few members who were willing to concede the probability ,of favorable action at the present session on many of the recommendations contained therein. The general opinion was that time would not permit of action in view of the fact that the session will close March 4. Priof to the cabinet meeting Presi­ dent Taft devoted an hour to seeing congressional callers. Probably his most interesting vis­ itor was Representative-elect Caleb Powers of Kentucky, who was con­ victed three times of complicity in the Goebel murder case. Mr. Powers was introduced to the president by Senator Bradley, who declared that the new member of congress had been' vindicated by the heaviest vote ever given a congressman in his district. President Taft will devote most of the remainder of this week to con­ ferences with senators, representa­ tives and men of prominence regard­ ing the judicial appointments which he is expected to send to the senate next week. 

MAKES MANY NOMINATIONS President Sends Large Number of Ap­ pointments, to Senate. Washington, Dec. 7.—Among several hundred nominations sent to the son ate by the president were those of John W. Garrett of Maryland to toe United States minister to Venezuela and Charles S. Wilson of Maine to be secretary of embassy at Rome, Italy. The nomination of Frederick W. Lehmann of Missouri to bo solicitor general also was sent lit. Other nominations are John C. Ames, collector of cvetpnofi of tbe dis­ trict of Chicago E. P.
