NO, 201 m FOR UBELIKG PRESIDENT Roosevelt Sends Ringing Message on False and Scurrillous Statements TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE MATTER Denies the Allegation Made Against the Good Faith and Honesty of the Canal Purchese and Gives Proof of Absolute Fairness. 

HOUSE REFUSES TO AMEND RULES " Washington, Dec. 15. President "Roosevelt today sent to the senate a statement concerning the purchase of Ihe Panama canal property by the United States, denouncing In strong 'language the charges that there was anything wrong in the acquisition of the canal. "These stories," he continues, "were first brought to my attention as (pub lished in a paper in Indianapolis, vailed 'The News,' edited by Delavan Smith. The stories were scurrilous and libelous In character and false in every essential particular. Smith shelters himself behind the excuse that he merely accepted the state ments which had appeared in a paper published in New York (the World), owned by Joseph Pulitzer. It is Idle to say that the known character of Pulitzer and his newspaper are such that statements in that paper can be believed by nobody. Unfortunately, thousands of persons are ill informed In this respect, and believe the state ments they see in iprint, even though they appear in a newspaper published by Pulitzer." . Wants Pulitzer Prosecuted. After pointing out mistakes and al leged misrepresentations in the Sto ries, the President continues: "The real offender is Joseph Pulit zer, editor and proprietor of the World. While the criminal offense of which Pulitzer has been guilty is in the form of a libel upon individuals, great .injury has been done in black ening the good name of the American people."' It 'should, no tUe -left -to .pri vate citizens' to sue Pulitzer for libel. He should be prosecuted for libel by the 'government authorities. "It is a high national duty to bring to justice as a villifier of the Ameri can people this man who wantonly and wickedly and without & shadow of justification, seeks to blacken the character of reputable private citizens and to convict the government of his country in the eyes of the civilized world of wrong doing of the basest and foulest kind, when he has not one shadow of justification of any sort for the charges he makes. The attorney General has under consideration the form in which proceedings against Pulitzer shall be brought." The President refers to various pa pers which he transmits with his mes sages. In explaining the method of concluding the purchase the President takes upon himself the responsibility for all that was done to carry out the will of Congress. The action of the government, he says, was wholly unin fluenced by any question of who were or were not stockholders either in the new or the old company. "Our concern," he says, "was to get the canal property which was owned by the French company, and to see that the title was clear. Our transaction was carried on openly, and published in detail." Everything Open. He says the United States did not have anything to do with the distribu tion, otg. dollar of the money paid except interflowing the instructions of the French court, and thafr under the circumstances there was not the slight est, need for Mr. Cromwell to giye iny information. "Nevertheless," he con tinues, "Mr. Cromwell of his own ac cord submitted to me, together with a copy of his statement, published on the.llth instant, and which I transmit herewith, a full list of the stockholders of the New Panama Canal Company of France on January 15, 1900 (number ing over 6,000), and a list of ail stock holders who were present at the spe cial amiln.JiOLa-COiiipaw'.iicld Fab-, ruary 28,,.1902, immediately after the cable offer of the company was made to the United States to accept the appraisement of forty, million dollars made by the Isthmian Canal Commis sion. So far . as this government is concerned," concludes the President "every step of the slightest importance has been made public by the execu tive, and every step taken in France has there been made public by the proper officials." - , Gradner Loses to Speaker After Long, Stubborn Fight. Washington, Dec. 15. The House today called the roll on 'a motion made by Representative Gardner of Massa chusetts to discharge the committee on foreign affairs from further con sideration of the resolution calling on the Secretary of State for a statement as to whether he has in his possession any information as to whether or not the British House of Commons has appointed a committee to report on the advisability of changing its rules, and that the resolution be considered by the House. Gardner is one of the so-called "in surgents" who believe the rules should be changed. The motion prevailed by a vote of 14G to 134 and thereupon he offered an amendment eliminating all reference to the Secretary of State for Information, leaving in the resolution simply the provision for the appoint ment of eight members to report on the question of revising the rules. The point of order was made that the reso lution was no longer privileged, aod this was debated at length. The speaker sustained the point and an appeal was taken from his ruling. The speaker was sustained by a vote of 149 to 130. The resolution then, on the motion of Gardner, after lie had further attacked the rules, was laid on the table, which kills the whole proposition.

Thomas D. Burns of Tierra Amarllla, the county seat, was in the city yesterday and Sunday on legal business. Mr. Burns who is the best known and most highly respected cit izen of northwest New Mexico, being the head of a large mercantile estab lishment, and also the owner of great herds of sheep an dmuch agricultural, timber and grazing land, and also en gaged in sawmill business In several of the timber localities in his section, said: "The county of Rio Arriba is in better condition than ever before, and I am glad that the people are improv ing in every way and are highly pros perous. Public schools with American teachers have been instituted, and in many of the school precincts young lady teachers fom Denver, Colorado, and Pueblo are teaching." They like their work and the children like their new American teachers, and all of them in the towns where there are English teachers are learning the En glish language. In another ten years," said Mr. Burns, "the people of this county will all understand and speak the English language, and only the old people who have not had the chance which the boys and girls now enjoy will be ignorant of the English tongue. County Is Prosperous. "Our county pays the Interest on its funded debt regularly, and is putting by a sinking fund. When the bonds shall mature the principal will be paid on date. Our last county treasurer, -M. A. Gonzales of Abiquiu, was very honest and painstaking and accounted for every cent of public funds that ' came into his possession. The next , county treasurer, B. C.-Hernandez, Is- a merchant of Tierra Amarilla, speaks English well, and is a bright, honest and competent man. He will make a fine treasurer and collector. "In five years, I think, our county will be completely free of debt, and if the Andrews statehood bill passes, and the United States gives the territory the donations of public land for help ing the county to settle its indebted- . ness, our county taxes will be very small, as our county commisslonejs are economical and efficient. Lands Should Be Opened. "I sincerely hope both for the good of the Jicarilla Apaches and of our American native settlers that the splendid reservations of about 500,000 acres in the northwestern part of our county will be thrown open to settle ment and the Indians given enough land to make them self-sustaining, but no more. I have lived here in Tierra Amarilla over 40 years, and am very friendly to the Indians, knowing every one of them from the old ancestors to the grandchildren. There are great tracts containing most valuable pine timber, big deposits of good coal, and many sections of land that can be irri-v gated successfully for agriculture and will raise vast quantities of alfalfa, potatoes, oats and other cereals and hundreds of thousands of acres fine for the grazing of cattle and sheep. These lands should be thrown open, and if It is done and American settlers know the facts, the section will soon be a rich agricultural and livestock raising country, where a good class of Ameri can citizens will obtain a competency and become wealthy. Stock Raising Profitable. "This year's season so far as sheep and cattle are concerned was very fair, and the losses by bad weather were few. However, the wool grow ing industry was not as good as It should have been, as the ' average prices for our fleeces amounted to only about 12 cents per pound, when last year our sheep growers received. 17 and 18 cents. This is a great dif ference and was markedly felt. Lambs, sheep and steerg sold pretty well, but not as well as in previous years. Our people, however, hope for the best, and for a more prosperous year in, 1909. They have the greatest confi dence fn President Taft, and are con vinced that his administration will bo one that will prove best for the labor- -; ing people. ' Forest Restrictions.
