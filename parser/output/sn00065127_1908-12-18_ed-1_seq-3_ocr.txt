CHICAGO. While the commercial mortality c* hfbita a surprising elimination of weak concerns, the progress made this week is attested by sustained gain in vol ume of payments through the banks and steadier conditions in manufactur ing. Some branches now prepare for the annual inventories and repairs, but tliere Is Increase In hands employed and a better flow of specifications and estimates. Leading retail lines heVa and at interior iKiints are seasonably stimulated by colder weather and the absorption of heavyweight apparel, household needs and food products makes gratifying headway. Christmas wares sell freely and the improvement also appears to some extent in the lux uries. Heavier movements are seen In the hreadstuffs. provisions and llva stock, with prices at a lower average and more encouraging to consumers. A strengthening intiueni'e is derived from the sustained recovery In earn in rs of the Chicago steam roads. Freight offerings of heavy materials, finished products and general merchan dise steadily expand. Mercantile col lections are slow to improve on local bills, but country settlements aro prompt.

Those with liabilities over $5,000 number 13, against 5 last week, 5 in 1007 and 3 in 190.—Dun's Review of Trade. NEW YORK. ICetail and holiday trade are more it evidence this week, and, as these have expanded, bnsineM in regular whole sale and jobbing lines has quieted down. Colder weather and the ap proach of the close of the year have helped to stimulate final distribution, but it is noted that both regular retail trade and the usual Christmas shopping demand have not yet fully met expec tations at many points, and particularly at the South, where low-prioed cotton is a retarding feature. Best reports come from the southwest and the spring wheat and Pacific Northwest. In whole sale and jobbing, except where the lat ter trades are engaged in quick ship ments to meet current needs, there is si disposition to go slower, pending a clearer view of year-end distribution and the taking of inventories. In in dustrial lines, while there is still some idle machinery, the volume of orders booked is sufficient to induce manufac turers to go ahead freely, though this branch notes the influence of higher prices on some raw materials.

The Aerial Navigation Company, which was formed to operate an airship line be tween Boston and New York, has leased two acres of land in Boston for station No. 1, and secured landing privileges on Commonwealth avenue and near the Har vard Bridge. Capt. Baldwin promises the delivery of the first dirigible not later than May 1. Eugene M. Foss has ordered work to begin at once on the construction of a $5,000,000 cotton mill in East Boston. It will require 8,000 workers to operate the 7,500 looms and 250,000 spindles. The plant will occupy spty-five acres fronting on the Chelsea river, and the expectation is to make Boston the greatest textile center in New England. Dr- D. K.

CANAL IS UNDERMINM). Difficulties from Water at Panama Shown in Report of Commission. With an average of 43,057 men on cue pay roll tor the last nscui j«ur and appropriations made to date of $120,964,4158.58 and expenditures of $84,572,008.55, both iuclusivc of the original purchase price of the canal of $40,000,000, the Panama canal construc tion is making progress, according to the annual report of the Isthmian canal commission, issued in Washington the other day. One of the significant fea tures of the report is the fact that it Is truly militaryesque In style. It makes no guesses, but is confined to state ments of historical fact which cannot be disputed or become subjects of con troversy. One of the interesting chapters of the report is on the lock and dam construc tion. In view of the reported break in the Gatun dam, the experience of the commission in the construction of the Sosn-Corosal dam and the Gatun locks is important at this time as illustrat ing the unexpected obstacles being met with by the army engineers in charge of the work. It was found necessary to move the nlte of the Sosa-Corosal dam when supimsedly solid ground shifted. In the former instance it became neces sary to move the site of the dam be cause of the shifting of the ground when dumping was begun, and this de spite the fact that the plans and speci fications showed the foundation for the proposed dam to be a solid base. Bor ing at Gatun, where the reported break is alleged to have taken place recently, plainly indicated the presence of un derground water, but the engineers were proceeding with the greatest con fidence that the difficulty could be ob viated and that the bottom was sound. In the Culebra cut division during the past year 12,065,138 cubic yards of earth and roclc have been removed by ffrcy-nine steam shovels. Plans to di vert the Cliagres river, the Obispo riv er, and other streams on the east side of tbe canal have been carried on in conjunction with the wort at this point ar.d, in addition thereto, it has been necessary to take care of four large landslides, one of which was an inherit ance from the old French company and amounted to 140,000 square yards. Large excavations have also been made at Empire City, Empire Hill, Gold Hill and the Pedro Miguel lock site. Sanitary conditions on the canal con tinue to Improve from year to year and have practically ceased to be a subject of newspaper comment such as charac terized the beginning of the wortt. French labor unions have a membership of 1,500,000. There are about 330,000 laundresses in this country, according to the last census. There are fifty-seven active labor unions in Santa Clara county, California, of which forty-one are in tihe city of San Jose. The Chinese government has established a school at Shanghai to instruct the sons of fishermen in modern methods of fish culture. In 1828 the Workingmen's party, a lo cal political organization, appeared in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other large cities. Boston's labor movement is to have an eight-hour labor chorus of women mem bers of Boston union% along the lines of the famed women wage earners' chorus of Chicago. The law of New York forbidding boys and girls under fourteen years of age from selling newspapers in the streets be tween 10 p. m. and 6 a. m. has gone into effect. About 150 labor measures will be pre sented to the next California Legisla ture by the State Federation of Labor, the State Building Trades Council, central bodies and individual unions. Wages of the Cleveland (England) iron •tone miners and Weardale quarrymen have been reduced by three-quarters of 1 per cent, a majority on a vote of the employes having agreed to these terms, sought by the employers. Fifteen different municipalities of Al sace-Lorraine, ranging in population from 5,000 to 175,000, conduct employment bu reaus which aim to keep in close touch with the various organizations of employ ers and employes. Work toward the formation of a metal trades department of the Boston (Mass.) Central Labor Union has been started by locals of the international unions which are affiliated with that new department of the Anlerican Federation of Labor. The State of California has sent out a special labor commissioner to the conti nent of Europe, New Zealand and Aus tralia to study labor questions, especially as to strikes and lockouts, in order to find, if possible, some plan of averting them by legislation. The first Japanese emigrants to Brazil, 783 in number, have just sailed for that country from Tokio. They will work on the Brazilian railroads. Brazil pays two thirds of their passage money, and after six months will give each a grant of land to induce him to settle. In Mertz, Germany, with 65,000 popu lation, there are three unskilled to every four skilled workmen. Muelhausen, with 100,000 population, has sixty-nine unskill ed laborers in every 100. In Strassburg, with a population of 175,000, there are two skilled to every three unskilled. In the fall of 1792 the pioneer union of the shoe workers was organized in Philar delphia. It grew to be considered a power, and in 1796 a strike in all the shops of the city was ordered to enforce a demand for an increase in wages. It lasted iut a few days, the employers rec ognizing the demand. Boston (Mass.) stationary firemen's union bas organized a class in steam en gineering which will take a course at the Boston mechanics' art high school under the evening industrial school system. The Spanish labor laws fix ths maxi mum working hours for children between the ages of ten and fourteen at six hours in industrial establishments and eight in shops and offices, with no work at night. Central Federated Union (Manhattan, New York) has decided to co-operate with die Charity Organisation Society of that city in ita efforts to arreat tba pro frees of tuberculosis among ths mm crafts.

Resources of Institutions at Last Accounts $9,027,260,484, Hav ing Doubled Since 1900. The banking power of the United States to-day Is shown to be $17,642, 705,274 in the annual report of Law rence O. Murray, Comptroller of the Currency. This is an amount exceeding «e world's banking power In 1890. There are 25,000 banks and banking in stitutions In the United States. The Comptroller places the world's banking power to-day at $28,107,600,000. This places the aggregate banking power of the world at $45,750,300,000. The report deals almost exclusively with figures. Mr. Murray has this to say on failures and the cause: Of the thirty-three national banks for which receivers were appointed during the year ended Oct. 31, 1908, nine banks, with aggregate capital of $1,290,000 were restored to solvency and authorized to resume business, while receivers proceeded to liquidate the assets of twenty-four banks found to be irretrievably insolvent. The nominal value of assets taken charge of by the receivers of these twenty-four banks was $31,415,511, the liabilities, so far as reported, being $19,342,610. Divi dends to the amount ot $7,994,600 have been paid to creditors of the banks which failed during the year, and the affairs of one sucih bank having been finally settled the receivership was terminated. "Noting the cause of failure of banks in charge of receivers during the year, it appears that seven banks were wrecked by the cashier, one by defalcation of offi cers and three chiefly through fraudulent management, among other causes. Of the remainder, four failed from excessive loans to others and depreciation of securi ties, etc., three by reason of injudicious banking, two from excessive loans to di rectors and others and two from deprecia tion of securities, one from failure of large debtors and one from general strin gency in the money market. The Comptroller estimates the num ber of depositors in national bants at 5,250,000. Here are figures showing bank earnings Consolidating the reports of earnings and dividends for the year ended July 1, 1908, on an average capital and surplus of $S93,932,010 and $548,850,476, respec tively, the gross earnings are shown to be $332,454,602 losses, etc., charged off, $50,56S,265, and expenses and taxes paid, $150,551,049, leaving net earnings of $131,335,288. The aggregate amount of dividends paid during the periods was $97,336,282, an average of 10.89 per cen* Continuing, the report says: On or about June 30, 1908, the banks of the country had on hand $1,368,329, 383, against $1,113,742,316 in 1907, a gain of $254,587,367 during the year. About two-thirds of the cash holdings of the banks of the country is in national banks. Bank resources have more than doubled since 1900, but during the current year there has been a decrease of about one third of 1 per cent.

(casus inquiry Shows Railways Are Large Holders of Carrier Stocks. flX RATES BY AGREEMENTS. iix Leading Companies Dominate In the Paokage Transportation Business. An Investigation of the express busi ness of the United states has just been completed by the census bureau of the government, which covers all phases of that business anil shows in detail the relations of the express companies with the railroads of the country. It Is *hown, for Instance, that the railroads of the country own more than one fourth of the stock of the express com panies and that, in turn, the express companies own railroad stock to the Amount of more than $22,000,000, which 1s also a figure in excess of one-fourth of their own capitalization. The con tracts between the companies and the railroads arc set forth as well as the method of determining the rates. In 1907 there were thirty-four ex press companies as compared with eigh teen In 1890. Only ten of the companies reporting In 1890 were in existence un der the same name in 1907 the remain ing eight companies have gone out of business, hnve been absorbed by other companies or are operating under other names. The total express mileage has Increased from 174,059 miles to 235,903 miles, a gain of 35.5 per cent. Companies that Dominate. In 1907 as in 1890 the express busi ness was dominated by the following companies: Adams, American, Pacific, Southern, United States, and Wells, Fargo & Co. The last-mentioned leads in the amount of mileage operated, with the American Express Company a close second. These six leading companies operated 92.7 per cent of the total mile age in 1890 and 87.5 per cent in 1907. In the number of miles covered by express companies Texas ranks first among the States and territories, fol lowed, in the order named, by Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Kansas. The use of steamboat lines is most extensive in Alaska, where water routes furnish practically the only facilities for transportation. In Maine, New York, Washington and Michigan the steamboat mileage is also large. Electric roads are used by the express companies in only twenty States. Seventy-two per cent of the total mileage by electric roads is in Ohio, New York and California. In only fifteen States are stage lines still used by express companies, and 88.7 per cent of the mileage of such lines Is In the Western States, principally California and Nevada. Receipt* and Expenditure*. The total receipts of all the express companies amount to $128,117,176, of which 97 per cent Is receipts from op eration and 3 per cent receipts from other sources. Over 90 per cent of the total receipts represents the receipts of the six leading companies. Two im portant items of expense in the express business are the amounts paid to steam roads and the salaries and wages, which in 1907 were $56,378,349 and $39,531,754, respectively, and together constituted, as in 1890, over 80 per cent of the reported operating expenses. BIO APPLE CROP. This Year's Growing Estimate! to Be About 25,000,000 Barrels If the apple harvest in the commer cial orchards of the United States this year were converted Into pies the army of bakers needed to do the work would turn out 6,250,000,000 of them, and these placed side by side would make a path of almost 975,000 miles. The total weight of this mountain of pastry Is estimated at 9,210,000 pounds, Including 6,125,000,000 pounds of flour, lard and other ingredients used in the popular American after-dinner dese^vt, and would require 154,166 cars of standard capacity to transport them from the ovens to the consumers. Twenty-five million barrels, or 62, 600,000 bushels, is the estimated yield this season, according to reports receiv ed by Harry J. Neely, secretary of the national apple show at Spokane, from 15,000 growers, operating the various belt* in the Union. The returns show that while droughts, excessive rains, or pests wrought havoc in many districts in the middle -western, eastern and several southern States, the entire crop is fully as large as In 1907 and It is better dis tributed. Prices also are higher than last year. However,' the domestic sup ply Is smaller than at any time since 1895, for the reason that the demand of the export trade Is heavier and in creasing yearly. Bad Emotloiu Polnonona. Dr. Landone, who plans to improve the human race by Burbank's plant theories In the rearing of children, in a recent Interview dwelt on the value of cultiva ting love and cheerfulness and good thoughts toward mankind. "For," he said, "the body is a substance composed of chemicals and these chemicals are at the mercy of the emotions. Anger, hatred and sorrow poison the fluids of the body, while love, cheerfulness and happiness serve as eliminators of emotive and fa tigue poisons. The Tabercaloila Exhibit. The international tuberculosis exhibi tion which was first brought together at great expense during the recent congress of experts at Washington, has now been moved to tbe Museum of Natural His tory at New York for the benefit of the people of that city. Nobel Prise to MeirhnlkolT. Prof. Metr" nikoff, th» rtusnian snbdl reetor of the Pasteur Institute, who will receive half the Nobel prize this year for medico-physiological research, announces that he will devote the sum to further study of means to promote longevity. What was accomplished toward the construction of the big ditch across the American Isthmus during the last fiscal year Is told* with much detail In the re port of the ("mini Commission. It shows that the total cost of the canal to date, Including the $29,000,000 appro priated for the year 1909, Is $120, 9(!4,4.s. With au average of 43,057 workers on the |«iy roll, the death rato per thousand was 18.32, less than half of the previous year. The decrease was especially among the blacks, and this testifies to Improved sanitation. During the year 929 patients in the hos pitals died out of 27,523 treated. Ma chinery in use at the end of the year included 101 steam shovels, 30 Ameri can and French locomotives, 3,451 American cars and 659 French cars, 20 cranes, 30 unloaders, 9 track Bhlfters, IS pile drivers. 23 earth spreaders and 44! unloading plows. All the settlements were supplied with electric lights, num bering 13.365 six teen-candle lights. The annual report of I'ostnrastei General .Meyer discloses a deficit ot $1 .910,278. the larftest in the history of the department, 'the increase In reve nue having leon oaly half the ordinary rate of recent years. Tbe chief cause of the deficit Is the large Increase of the rural free delivery system, which cost $.",4.3S1.4t»:'». Tli Postmaster Gen eral recommends now a parcel jxjst ad dition to the rural delivery, believing that it would he not only of great ben efit to the farmers, but would earn mill ions for the postal service. Further more. It is urged that such a servict would tiolp the small local stores. A new counterfeit $5 silver certlft eat«, Indian head, has been discovered by the secret service oflicluls, who de clare that it is a dangerous and decep tive counterfeit. It is said to be par ticularly deceptive by reason of the fact that it is painted on genuine paper, which has been obtained by bleaching a note of smaller denomination, probably a $1 bill. Captain Emmet Crawford, of the Third United States cavalry, who was kilied in the attempt to capture Ge ronimo twenty-two years ago, is to be honored with a place In the National cemetery. The remains have lain at Kearney, Neb., since 1880. They will be disinterred and transferred to Ar lington cemetery, and there reburied with military honors. Preliminary to making its report th» national monetary'commission held its first formal meeting in Washington. The decision was reached to draft a set of questious to be submitted to for eign bankers and authorities, the an swers to which it is expected will be valuable in the preparation of a general financial measure for the United States. The Navy Department bas ordered that the official address of the naval station at Guam hereafter shall be in the Marianne Islands instead of the Ladrone Islands, which they were named under Spanish rule. Ladrone Is Spanish for robber, and the inhabitants claimed that such a suggestive name did them injustice. A grand total of $2,069,289,196 worth of mineral products in the Unit ed States during the past year is an nounced by the geological survey. Of this amount $1,160,165,191 were non metallic, $903,024,005 metalic, and $100,000 not specified. The mineral products for the previous year aggre gated $1,904,007,034. The National Conservational Com mission, which grew out of the first conference of governors and other not able men at the White House last win ter, completed its Inventory of the na tion's resources, with the aid of the executive departments of the govern ment, and these facts were reported at a meeting of the commission. The total receipts of the Federal Land office for the year were $12,715, 709, an increase over the previous year of $1,162,531. The total area of land originally entered during the year Is 19,090,356 acres, a decrease of 1,907,200 acres, as compared with 1907. The to tal area upon which final proof was made Is 8,068,014 acres. General revision of the American financial system cannot be hoped for al the coming session of Congress, but the members of the national monetary com mission expect there will be a law pass ed corrective of some of the developed evils In the administrative features ot banking. The report of Second Assistant Post master General Stewart tells of a big saving to the government from the new method of weighing the mails carried by the railroads. The old way was to test the weight of the mails on each road lor six successive days and tak« the average for the 365 days of ths year. Now the weighing covers a larg er period, and the saving will run Into the millions.

FIRE LOSSES ARE ENORMOUS. Figures Show Big Increase Over Those of Last Year. The fire loss of the United States and Canada for the month of October as com piled from the carefully kept records of the Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin, aggregates $22,722,850. The fol lowing table giving the losses by months for this year and the preceding joar af fords a startling comparison, demonstrat ing the unusually heavy fire waste of the past few months: 1907. 1908.
