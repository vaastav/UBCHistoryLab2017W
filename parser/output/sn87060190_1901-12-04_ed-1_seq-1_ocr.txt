Washington, Dec. 3 In anticipation of the receipt of President Roosevelt's first message to congress, the memhers of the senate assembled early in the senate chamber and In the cloakrooms adjoining. Many sen ators, particularly the close personal and political friends of the president, already were familiar with the princi pal features of the message, but the reading of the first Important stato paper of the president was marked by unusual inteiest. Despite the cold and penetrating rain which fell throughout the morn ing the senate galleries were well filled with Interested spectators, many of them having a special Interest in the message. A communication was received from the house informing the senate that that body had been organized and was ready to proceed with public business. Senators Hale and Morgan reported that they had waited upon the presi dent in conjunction with a like com mittee of the house to inform him that congress was prepared to receive any communication he might have to make, and the president said be would communicate with congress at once in writing. Major O. I. Pruden, assist ant secretary to the president, then was recognized and presented the mes sage of the president, the reading of which was begun ai once by Heniy M. Rose, chief clerk. Close attention was given to the reading of the message by all senators, the majority of whom followed the reading from the print ed copies of the message distributed among them. The reading of the message con sumed two hours and 15 minutes. When It was completed, Mr. Foraker was recognized to offer the following resolution, for which he asked imme diate consideration: "That a committee of 11 senators be appointed on the part of the senate to join such committee as shall be ap pointed on the part of the house to consider and report by what token of respect and affection it may be proper for the congress of the United States to express the deep sensibility of the nation to the tragic death of the late President McKlnley and that so much of the message of the president as re lates to that deplorable event, be re ferred to such committee." The reso lution was adopted and then as a further mark of respect to the mem ory of the late president, the senate, on motion of Mr. Foraker, adjourned. In the House. There was a very good attendance In the galleries of the house to listen to the reading of the first message of President Roosevelt. The members gathered early chatting and discuss ing prospective legislation. The main topic was the personality of the new president. Keen Interest was mani fested in what he would have to say in his message. As the hands of the clock pointed to 12, Speaker Henderson called the house to order. After the journal was read and approved, Mr. Cooper (Tex.) and Mr. Wood (Cal.) were sworn in. On motion of Mr. Payne, the floor lead er of the majority, it was agreed that when the house adjourn It be to meet Friday of this week. The sneaker announced the appoint ment of the committee on rules as fol lows: Mr. Henderson of Iowa, Mr. Dalzell of Pennsylvania, Mr. Oros venor of Ohio, Mr. Richardson of Tennessee and Mr. Underwood of Ala bama. The only change In the com mittee was the substitution of Mr. Un derwood for Mr. Bailey of Texas, who is now a member of the senate. Mr. Bingham (Penn.), at the head of the committee appointed to wait upon the president, reported that the com mittee, accompanied by a like com mittee of the senate had performed its duty and that the president would at once tommunicate with the two houses In writing. Two minutes later Major Pruden, assistant secretary to the president, appeared at the main entrance and announced a message from the president. The message, was taken to the speaker's . desk, where Speaker Henderson broke the seal. "A message from the president of the United States," he said as he handed the document to the reading clerk and directed him to read It. Ordinarily presidential messages at the opening of a congress are listen ed to in a perfunctory fashion, but throughout the reading of the message the keenest Interest was manifested. Hardly a member left his seat until the reading was concluded. There was a slight murmur of applause when In concluding the recommendation for legislation to put down anarchy, the clerk read "no matter calls more ur gently for the wisqst thought of con gress." The murmur when this sen tence was read was followed by a burst of applause when the clerk read, "The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath Is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame." Probably no other portion of the message attracted eo much atten tion as that relating to trusts. No demonstration was evoked by the reading of this portion of the message, but the recommendation for the re enactment of the Chinese exclusion law drew applause from both sides. The reading of the message was con cluded In the house at 2:35. Mr. Orosvenor then offered a resolution 1 line with the resolution offered" in Tho senate by Mr. Foraker providing for a committeo of one member from each state represented in the house to join the committee appointed on the part of the senate to consider and report proper action for congress respecting the death of President McKlnley.

Representative Brown low of Tennessee led the list with 252 bills and resolutions. Cabinet Meeting. Washington, Dec. 3. The cabinet meeting was principally consumed in a discussion of insular decisions hand ed, down Monday by the supreme court. On the whole it is believed (he views of the majority of the court are quite satisfactory to the administra tion. It was pointed out that the ulti mate results of these decisions are In a measure speculative at present with the exception that the customs duties collected in this country on goods shipped from the Philippines since the ratification of the Paris treaty will have to bo refunded. It is not thought, however, that the aggregate will be large and Secretary Jage ex pects that It will be within $1,000,000. Ho called attention to the fact that the great bulk of the Imports from the Philippines -were admitted freo of duty under our general tariff laws, notably hemp, which Is one of the leading staples of the group. Mr. Gage thinks the present tariff in op eration In the Philippines will need little or no revision. Philippine Tariff Collected. Washington, Dec. 3. Secretary of War Root has declined to express an opinion as to the effect of the in sular decisions in the supreme court, until he has had an opportunity to read them In full. Figures obtained at the war department and. treasury bu reaus of statistics relative to the trade affected show that from the be ginning of United States occupancy of the Philippines, Aug. 22, 1898, up to June 30, 1902, the total Imports in the Philippines from the United States wore valued at $1,607,480, while dur ing the same .period the Imports from Spain were valued at $1,993,990. On the other hand, the imports Into the United States from the Philippines from Sept. 1, 1898, to Dec. 1, 1901, ag gregated $15,448,600. But of this large total only $1,894,523 consisted of du tiable goods, so that the refund on thite would not be large. Going After Anarchists. Washington, Dec. .3.

Bank Odlclnls Discover That It Was Systematically Appropriated. Bellston, N. Y., Dec. 3. The First national bank of this place was closed Tuesday pending an investigation Dy a national examiner. It is stated that the closing of the bank followed the discovery of Irregularities in the ac counts of the teller, Charles E. Fitch am. The bank began business in 1865. Judge J. S. Lamoreaux succeeded the late George West as president last Oc tober, and H. J. Donaldson succeeded to the vice presidency. The new exec utive officers began at once a thorough Investigation of the bank's affairs and discovered indications of a defalca tion on the part of Fitcham. The In vestigation developed that the defalca tion began many years ago. Bank Examiners Graham and Van Vracken were sent for and after a thorough examination they reported a shortage of $100,000. A warrant for Fitcham's arrest was issued. Fitcham was bonded to the amount of $1,000. He has a wife and one daughter. Pre ident Lamoreaux said It was not pos sible to determine the amount of Fitcham's defalcation without Inspec tion of outstanding certificates of de posit and pass books of depositors. He says the teller alone Is responsiole. Mr. Lamoreaux added that It Is not possible any loss can come to deposit ors or certificate holders, as the bank has a surplus of $100,000 which It i hoped will nearly or quite meet the deficit and leave the bank's capital of $100,000 unimpaired. An examination of the bank bv Examiner Van Vrack en last August failed to disclose any irregularltyc in the accounts. Fitcham is ill at his residence, where ho Is under arrest and guarded by two officers. Pistol That Killed Ayres. Washington, Dec. 3.
