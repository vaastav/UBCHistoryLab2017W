4 A WAR OF THE HOUSES THE LIBKP.iI. CJMTAIGS. Trcmicr.Asquiih's Plan to Force Fight with Lords. [OwrirtW. }*& *7* *■ • x eminent is Liberal pnvernment is -nea-ures which the Lords would veto. An in fi U ,ntia, ,ectio rt of the Party follower, J .the Commons has <,uestioned the exned.ency of t. tactics and has favored Immed.ate dilution en the grnurd that the Liberals would return Sth a reduced majority and continue work^ whereas they would M-mbrr^ sicT,in ? BrW» they wait too lone. Members «gntag Sir John Banners memorial shared tWs.oplnlon. and th« leading Liberal journals, uniting m proclaiming Jt sought to force the Prime Minister's band. Mr \squith has not surrendered the leader ship to bTWnsibte groups of members or edi tors. Like a man of force, he remains in com mand and rallies the party around him. W Wle Us *.p~ch at the National Liberal Glub did not satisfy all his followers, it convinced them that they had a leader of inflexible will. What is now clear isthat there will be no gen eral flection next year, unless the Lords throw out aggressively the Radical budget. This they. can do if they do not attempt to amend it. They have not done it for over sixty years, but they have the constitutional right to take this ex treme action and force an appeal to the country, bringing in tariff reform if the country supports them, but taking the risk.- of a complete defeat. with an ...... reduction in their mv legis lative privileges. Mr. Asquith has not fore e-hadowed this contingency, but has contented himself with brushing aside the pretension of ibe Lords to challenge hi appeal to the country on th*» natal hill and with concentrating at tention on the budget as the principal work of the next session. If this be based on taxation of land values, proposals for the extension of modal reforms and fresh levies on the liquor traffic and millionaires, it may be radical enough to bring on the crisis. Mr. Asquitli. in place of ploughing the Bands and filling up the cup, gives Liberalism a bey phase, with the veto of the Lords as the dominating issue in politics, and supports it by. tho unanswerable argument that a. government of the people is impossible when a. defeated Opposition with a feeble minority in the Commons Is able t>> keep in operation educa tion and licensing lama which the general elec torate has condemned. The fighting v.i!l l>e forced on the budget, and Fham battles ■■■. highly contentious measures ■which the Lords can reject .vith impunity will be discontinued. The session of Parliament BOW promises to dfa? cut without a serious conflict. Th» port of London bill sc-ems safe, and while the miners" eight hours bill may be amended the Lords are not likely to reject it and thereby challenge the Interests of labor. The govern ment, in spite of the loss of its two main meas ure?, will have a creditable record of industry far the year. The autumn session has been moat exhausting and i= n-t likely tc be repeated in the present Parliament.'. - j x F '■' i

ICop>-rl«h.t. 180?. by The Tribune Association.] London, Dec. 12.— The German press does not accustom itself easily to the sovereign's disap pearance from public affairs, and assumes that he must be seriously ill. Prince yon Billow's Influence is completely restored and he employs it In the Interests of peace. - The opening of the Turkish parliament next week -by the Sultan in person is a sign that the world moves. It will be a mixed assembly, with every race and nationality represented and with an untrustworthy, majority for the reform factions. This constitutional experiment has command ed less attention in England than has the new law In India against sedition, by which anar chists and assassins will be tried by an ex traordinary tribunal of three High Court judges. This repressive measure, which contrasts strangely with "what is going on In Turkey, is justified by the urgent necessity of stamping out organized resistance to British rule. American affairs have fallen into the back ground. The free traders make considerable use of the Treasury deficit as an argument against the resources of protection In finance, and the editor of "The Economist," writing from Hot Springs, Va.. forecasts a reduction of the American tariff as a result of Mr. Taft's in fluence and public opinion. "The Saturday Re view" reaches the fantastic conclusion that America is "entering upon that struggle between the man and the state, between Individualism and collectivism, which has exercised the best minds ever since the days when sophists argued In the gardens of Athens." "The Times" is taking up reform as an imperial rather than an Anglo-American in terest, find Is not shrinkinp from collectivism in favorine the widest recognition of the policy of stato owned and state controlled cables.

Mr. Gibbons said, "we find now that when we undertake to attempt to do any business foreign in its nature we are. obliged to go to the ambassador at Washington, who, in the very nat ure of things, does not know as much of Canadian affairs as he should know, and. in bis turn, this ambassador hands the business over to the Colonial Office at London, which knows still less about Can ada, and finally It comes back to Ottawa, where it should have been attended to In the first place." Mr. Gibbons said he admired the spirit of loyalty in Canada and Imped that Its relations with the, old country would always continue friendly, but if it was to be a self-respecting nation and hoped to gain the respect of kindred Anglo-Saxon and other race*, it would hay« to learn to do and be free to do its own business.

NEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE, SUNDAY. DECEMBER 13. 1908. CASTRO A GOURMAND HIS RECEPTION IX PARIS. Rebukes His Brother— Operation Thought To Be Financial. [Special by French <"abS« to The Tribune. [Coryriftht. 1908. by The Tribune Association. ] Paris. Dec. 12.— President Castro's arrival in Paris is hailed with ironical curiosity. A group of policemen, detectives. Journalists and half a dozen daintily gowned Parisian women stood on the platform when his train came to a stop, and one of these women exclaimed, as Castro stepped from his car.' "Mon Dieu! How ugly he is!" The diminutive President wore an enor mous pearl gray felt hat. He was tightly but toned up in a dark overcoat, and his shoes were of brilliant patent leather, with thick India rub ber soles. He walked with difficulty, and sup ported himself with a very large gold-headed .cane. On his finger was a ring; with a huge solitaire diamond. His face is deep yellow, his under 'jaw is firm and heavy. like that of a bull dog, and his black eyes sparkle with malice. He stopped at the Palais D'Orsay Hotel, be cause it was feared that he might have a hostile reception, and this being a railway terminus hotel no passage through the streets was re quired. As he walked from the station into the station entrance of the hotel he looked In dismay at the rolling mechanical stairway, which' he carefully avoided and took the ordi nary stairs. He was preceded by his wife and daughter, and walked alone at some distance ahead of the rest of the party, but when his brother approached nearly to his side he said to him abruptly in Portuguese. "It is I. not you. who an President. You must walk five paces behind me." Immediately upon Mme. Castro's arrival l six employes of a prominent dressmaking establish ment of the Rue de la Paix called with a num ber of large boxes filled with costly gowns. which had been ordered beforehand by cable Castro pays little attention to the three phy sicians who accompany him, and his repasts are almost Gargantuan, consisting of boiled turbot pate de foie gras. truffled pheasants, saddle' of lamb, and all sorts of delicacies and sweetmeats. He drinks copiously of the .finest wines, such, for instance, as Mouton Rothschild claret of 1875. Chateau Yquem. Romance. Comte Burgundy and brandy dating from 1830. Parisians scarcely credit the report that he Is preparing for a surgical operation, and hint that the immediate operation that he has in view is of a financial nature, and is a proposition to try to obtain a monopoly in Europe for the sale, of Venezuelan cigarettes. One of the conditions imposed by the French government for tolerating his presence in Purls, after his ignominious expulsion from Venezuela of the French Minister and the consuls, is that he shall make no communications to the press. His personal safety. In view of the numerous threats of assassination from relatives of en ezuelan victims of his tyranny, now in Paris, is assured by a complete service of policemen and detectives. Meanwhile it Is expected that he will make the first move toward according sat isfaction for his insults to France and to French diplomatic, and consular officials in Venezuela, which resulted some years ago in the severance of all relations between France and Venezuela.

CASTRO VENTURES OUT. Reported To Be Angry at French Government's Treatment. [By Th« A»socis.t«d Pre»»-1 Paris. Dec. 12.— President Castro of Venezuela, who arrived In this city yesterday evening from Bordeaux, is represented as furiously angry at the manner in which the government is receiving him in France. He has remained shut up In his apart ments in the hotel as closely as if he were a pris oner, and has seen no visitors except a few mem ber!" of the. Venezuelan colony. At 4:30 o'clock this afternoon, however, the Presi dent, accompanied by Dr. Baldo, one of his physi cians, came down the back stairway of the hotel. entered an automobile and drove rapidly away. The officials, of the Foreign Office have received formal orders 'to give" no explanation of the govern ment's r.Uitude toward the President of Venezuela. "Wo Ignore his presence," an official sold this morning. "The conditions on which the govern ment is willing to open negotiations have been communicated to him." These conditions, exrept one prohibiting Fresident Castro from making any politi.-<i! declaration, are not known, but It is believed that they inwlve a formal apology. A reporter called to see the President this norn lng. The only member of Castro'a household vis ible said that nothing had been decided, btat the party possibly would leave for Germany te-msrru^ A black maid in the service of Mine. Castre was sitting in a hall outside her mistress's door try ing to get her foot into a new pointed French shoe. The French newspapers generally poke fun at rhe "Dictator" of Venezuela; nevertheless, they insist that the government give the reasons whi'-h in duced It to change its attitude toward him. The "Temps" protests loudly against the eQV'VO rai position in which France has be^n pla the presence of President Castro, and insists that the government explain the enigma at on<-e The paper says it. is undignified to allow a mai who flaunted Franco to remain here without arology. "When M. Taigny fwho was FVench Minister at Caracas] was expelled." the "Temps" says. •'Amer ica was stupefied by our inaction, and to-day Hol land, with less of a rase. Is giving us a good les, eon." Where others had failed, a woman writer of a morning newspaper succeeded in getting an amus ing interview with President Cafctro, by sending up to him a letter in Spanish asking him to de liver a lecture on Venezuela before tha Liatln- American League. When the Venezuelan President appeared he, was muffled up In a thick greatcoat and almost smoth ered In a capacious cloth cap. He was very un gracious at first, but, finding that she was not a (Spanish woman, but a Parisian, he cheered up. He asked her, with ■ glance at the lowering sky out of the. window, if it was always cold In Paris. The. woman pointed out that It wap winter now, and said that if he went to Berlin for an opera tion he would find It much colder there. "Operation:" exclaimed President Castro. "I am no more sick than you are." Asked why he did not go to the Riviera. Presi dent Castro eaid that he bad heard of it. Here the reporter, seeing an opening to introduce poli ties, remarked: "Perhaps you would not be per mitted to go there." "I do exactly as I wish." said Castro, empha sizing his words with a thump on the tabis with his fist. He fenced the other questions with clum sy compliments, concluding by smilingly Baying that It was th* brightest hour of his stay In Paris', from which he would depart to-morrow.

London, Dec. 12.— The news from Vienna. is less warlike and the prospect of a settlement with Turkey is brighter. Austria-Hungary has already expended in ration for war far more than compensation on liberal terms for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina would cost. The Emperor's influence in favor of peace is strongly felt, and it Is not unlikely that monetary terms will be. agreed on and the Turkish , boycott suspended In the course of a few weeks. This will clear th» way for a conference, since gervia and Montenegro must settle down if Russia does not support them.
