Jaeses Tate of Brooklogsppent Sat urday evening with his bretbsr Em. A tew young people from this vl auandedthe Fireman's ball In and report a DAKOTA THE NEW SCHOOL HOUSE To the Voters and Taxpayers of Canton, South Dakota: an article In the Lkadbr under date of November 20th Professor Lawrence makes the following state, ment, "The Board of Education has decided to submit the question of is suing bonds for a new school building to a vote of the district as soon as ar rangements san be made for a bond election." In connection with this statement of Supt.Lawrence,about 10 daysbefor* that Mr. Jennings, president of the School Board called upon the under signed at his office, and said that on that evening a number of the tax payers of the cltv would assemble at the Auditor's office In the court house to view the proposed plan for a new high school building which the Board decided to build. And that a Bond election would be called to Issue bonds sufficient to pay for the construction of this building. The architect was present and showed perllminary sket ches of a school building which had been erected at Huron at a cost of 890,000 and It was proposed to submit the building of such a school houde to this city. Which would involve the expenditure of at least 890,000 for con structlon, because under the present high cost of all kinds of building materials and the high cost of labor, a building of that size could not be now built as aheaply as at the time the Huron high school was built. But the most astounding proposl tlon that was suggested was for this beautiful little city of ours to place a mortgage on all of its homes and pro perty for 8100,000- in-order to supply a high school building which would be good looking. To the conservative business men who are Interested in the city and have been with the city almost from Its beginning, over thirty years, and aware of the efforts which the people have made in order to build this beau tiful little city, the proposition that we should mortgage our homes for al most 8100,000 was startling indeed, and impressed me with the idea that such a proposition at this time when the commercial world is unsettled, when bonds of all kinds are iroing begging In the market, and can only be sold at a large discount when' the vast sources of money In Europe which were buying the American municipal bonds, railroad bonds and other securities, are entirely closed by the present war and no bonds can be sold In those countries and in addi tion those countries are throwing their bonds upon the American mar ket and also their stocks in order to defray the great expenses ol this war. And at this time when the cost of living is very high and Is continually going up when everybody is struggl ing to maintain themselves, it was startling indeed to suggest such an expenditure at this time. A 5 percent bond under normal con ditions would sell for a 5 percent pre mium paid by the buyer but under the present conditions It is doubtful If It cor Id be sold for 5 percent dis count paid by the seller which would mean a loss of 810,000 on a bond issue of 8100,000. To loose this sum all at one time would appear to be the height of folly. Then again the bonds would be hard to sell at all because at this time there Is no demand for bonds. The Issue may be that all they ask Is 875, 000 of bonds. That Is very well to be said. But under the constitutional limitation which the law Axes at per cent of assessed value a 875,000 bond Issue would bring us above the limit. We already are bonded for at least 810,000 and could not issue the •76,000 without exceeding the five percent limit. As stated. I have been a resident of the city of Canton for over 30 years, have reared a family In this city educated them through all the grades of the high school and college. I state these facte to show Prof. Lawrence that I believe In education just much as anyone else that 1 have had experience In rearing a family, in educating them, and In preparing them for life, and I certainly am not opposed to giving other people of the city equal opportunities with those that 1 have enjoyed myself. But as a business man I have all the oondl tlons to consider and my experience tells me that It would be very unwise to mortgage every home of the city in order to give less than one-fourth of the students the luxury pf an immense building, The next question which Is to he considered, Is, do we need at this time, a new high school building. And do we need one of the proportions of the one which has been suggested. 1 take the position that at this time we neither need a new high school building nor would such a one as is proposed be In any manner a proper one. To Illustrate the sketch which was presented in the meeting above referred to and which was builded at Huron shows an assembly room of 400 while, the full number of the high school scholars of Canton enrolled doee not exceed at the present time ISO and the probabilities are-that It will be a long time before our high school numbers will be Incresssd any. In order to ascertain whether or not there le any incresssd demand for high school facilities, it is well to compare the growth of the high school as shown by the reports of the Clerk of the dty school board. Mn I90B In the high school there were 42 males and 72 females 114 in all. In 1914 there were 48 males and femal ee, lie In all which is an increase of two in the six ysars. In 198» there were four teachers in the high In ISO» there wsra tour tod I* the high school, 

CANTON, LEADER: together with what was then the hall way between them have been made Into the present assembly room the partitions being taken out. In 1914 there were eight rooms occupied by the high school. The expense of running our school for 1909 was 815,926 03 for 1914 It was 818,594 14. The difference being al together substantially in the high school. So that the amount of runn ing the high school just about doubl ed in the six years but there were on ly two additional students. The number of students In the high school per teacher for 1914 was 13, and In the grades It was 40 one-eight. 361 grade students occupy eight rooms. The 116 high school students occupy eight rooms. So if there is any crowd ing anywhere, the crowding Is certain ly in the grades and not in the high school. But Professor Lawrence says the high school building is not a good looker. It looks just as well as It ever did. It Is substantially as good a building as it ever was. And to illus trate that it is not In bad repair, dur ing the past year the school board on ly spent 875 in repairing all of the school buildings, property which they report Is worth over $40.000. The proposition is to "junk" the high school building. The high school building as junk is worth nothing, the high school building as it Is to day is worth just as much as It ever was, it could not be built to-day for anywhere near what it was originally built for because material and labor have advanced so much. It will last for years to come and to throw away at least 825,000 worth of property at such a time as this would certainly be unwise. The desire for looks in public affairs, the same as In private affairs often brings people to ruin. But Professor Lawrence says that we need some rooms for izymnasi-ics and for other special courses, such as typewriting and short hand. With due defference to Prof.Lawrence's ex­ perience and ability, I wish to state that teaching typewriting and short hand in the public schools is certainly undersirable. Shorthand is bound to vanish in a very short time. The dic tating machines, I have one in my office and use it every day, takes the place of the stenographer. The ty pist is all that Is necessary, that is the girl who can use the typewriter Here in this city we are especially favored by having a good school, Au gustana College, which gives special courses in those branches, such as typewriting and shorthand, so that every student who desires that special training can get It. and can get It more cheaply than a course could be maintained in the high school. In a very few years we will sec very few stenographers in business typists and the dictating machines will take their places. Prof. Lawrence may ask me what. I have to suggest with reference to pro viding for the crowded condition of the grades. I have a suggestion to make. It is true that tnose grade schools are full to overflowing and there has been an increase in the grades while there has been substant ially none In the high school. The territory west of the railroad track has now about 75 families.. Those people have been paying taxes all the years and tftey have received no benefits from the water works, and received very little benefits from elec trie lights, and no sewers have been built In that section, and very little public expenditures made. They have paid their taxes, and we pave quite a large country territory attached to the city outside. There should be ward school built in the west part of the city to accommodate not only the people living there but those in the territory outside of the elty. That a school building there could be builded for just what it would cost to pay the Interest one year |on the bonds and the Increased expenses on the new high school buillding. Thosp peo ple are entitled to it. When that building was bullt'the eighth grade now in the high school could be mov ed to another building and at least one grade in the west side school could be moved over there. That would relieve all the grades add would give the additional room for the high school now occupied by the eighth grade. UKW As to the gymnasium we think that Is supplied, as conti I tlon of locating the Carnegie library In its present position on his lot, Mr. Thorson prom ised the electors of the city that he would build a gymnasium for the boys and girls of the city. We have no doubt but that he w#ll build this gymnasium next year. When that is done the gymnasium problem fs set tled. The manual training should be in the same building as the gymnasium. The boys who would tike the gymna sium would for the most part be the ones who would use the manual train ing. It Mr. Thorson did not think tnat he could afford to build the manuel training room in addition to the gymnasium, the city school dis trict could join with him and con struct the manual training room and that would solve the problem. This would relieve the high school build ing and It would not cost as much to construct them as it would to pay one year's Interest On the bonds. If Mr. Thorson thinks that he can not afford to build the gymnasium then I have no doubt but that ar rangementa could be made with htm by which he would give the city pehool district the lot and such other considerations as he thought would be fair, and then the school district could build a gymnasium and manual training room on this lot and It being to the high aohool there would v- be no danger of the students getting lest in crossing the street. This would solve that Problem. It will be but a few years when the north part of the city will be built up and it will be necessary to build an other grade school in that section. Wuen that school Is builded it would relieve the present east side school. If at that time there was no more in? crease' In the high school enrollment than there has been in tfiö last few years, the present high school build ing would be ample for all the de mands of the high school. Modest expenditures and repairs on the high school building would place It is just as good a condition as It ever was. It Anderson Furniture THE

Christmas gifts of furniture may be chosen with the greatest advantage at this store we know that no other stock in the county presents such an extensive variety of choice, suitable pieces, or more generous values at the prices asked. What is Better than a piece of furniture? It is useful and valuable—always in front of the lucky ceiver to remind him or her of the giver. The life-Time Gift You give a WORTH-WHILE remembrance in a piece of furniture for Christmas—it is always.iu goodjtaste, always appreciated, and a lasting, beautiful reminder of the giver. PIANOS J. ANDERSON & SONS FURNITURE AND UNDERTAKING 1 Lincoln County's Largest Furniture has lasted twenty-five years and has not even been painted on the outside, it Is good for twenty-flve years more. I think that it is unwise to junk It and throw it away. Again, the state of South Dakota is growing. It has a large amount of school lands which will either be sold or rented for higher rentals in the next six years and while the Income now from the permanent school fund gives every scholar in the state about six dollars, I have no doubt but in six years it will be doubled. When that time comes this additional money will assist us in building a new build ing. I have pointed out how we can get along and enjoy high school privi­ leges with the present building and not put a mortgage of $100,000 or even of $80,000 in excess of the $10,000 now on the homes of this city.
