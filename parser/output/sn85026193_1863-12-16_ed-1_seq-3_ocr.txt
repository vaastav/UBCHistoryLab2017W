The above is the first sontence of an item iu tho la.-t issue of the IfUjicmlctit, concerning the publi catiou of tho list of uncalled-for letters in last week's Jovr.SAt.. That it is a groundless false hood, is proved by the Joviinal of March IS 185", wherein Mr, Puuieroy published a list of uncalled for letters; and that it is a grossly malicious false hood, is evident from the fact that the m in who wrote it could not have even believed that u Tost Master who has been iu olllce since January 1ml, hasnot, until last week, puMialied a lUtof uncalled for letters. Having thus shown that hia Clot su tence is a lie, people will not consider it nrc.jovy for us to notice the remainder of his item for no one would placo any reliance in the evidence of n wituess who commenced hia testimony by per juring himself I Hut the aforesaid editor, on the above, us on every other occasion, "rings in" his " big circulation" qoostion, and we therefore take tho liberly of saying a word or two about his con cirn. Tm: " iKurri'vuHST "How it is Gottks IV! -The iii"i'ail is not " what it seems !" It pre tends aud possibly its thirty or frty readers may believe it to baa paper printed ut Perrvsbutg; but it isn't tint, by a Huh more rtmi i It ori ginally starts from the Dlmle ollice, Toledo, in this wise ! It is well known that, iu every city office, a large number of handbills, political and otherwise, are printed for general circulation throughout tho surrounding country. Now the o'inn'ciit man has a terrible mania for publishing a newspaper an4 the proprietors of the Vlwle, probably wishing to humor him, occasionally print oil some sheets, or handbills, headed, " Wood County Independ ent," for circulation in this county. They are, nf course, printed only on one side ! Watch the result I The Dayton and Michigan train comes thundering along stops at rerrysburg somebody throws off a wad of tho aforesaid bills hvlrpiDiU-nt man being on band, manages to get tho "first grab" at it " totea" it to hia shop, prints some thing diily on the other side, and jocosely calls it " my rtoospaper '." And tho people smile pitifully just as they do when some poor fellow, who has the "gold mania," aits from moruing till nijiht, fum bling over lid buttons, and calling them "eagles !" But this poor fellow is not content with calling his sheet a ' uoospapcr," but likewise Insists that it it the " largest circulation !" Ao i thu " reminds us" of a fellow wu ones know, who had tho " colt mania." He bad succeeded iu raising a very 'scrawny runt" of a colt, and when it was three years old, ha not only imagined (hat it was the bett colt in tbe country, but conceived that every ouo e!se thought ao tno and whenever anything was sanl, he Mipposert Unit it mini be souicthin iupr.ne ofhi.1 Colt. One day he hitched up his Colt with another animal, to go to a Lake port, a few miles distant, with a load of staves. Shortly after ho started, a neighbor shouted to hini, " llow much do you get for those itavos V" "Il's nulfin but a freo year old I" responded our hero, as ho cracked his whip an l jogged on. Soon after- trd a mer chant hailed him with, "Can you bring me in a load of salt, to-day 1" " Il's unllm but a free year old, sir !" be cj.iculaUd, c Isting an admiring glance at his colt. Agaiu the merehaut said, " I want you to bting mc in somo salt !" " I tell you it's miiii but a free yoar old," respunded tho colt man, as bo whipped up and went his way. Thn it is with the Mepmdmt " largest circula tion" mania man. As ho sits in his sanctum, oc cupying the slick of wood which he terms his arm chair, writing bis editorial on tbe margin of au old "handbill," a man enters, and the following ron versatiun takes place : Utramjcr " (iood day, sir." .1oiiiti .'mi " Ye, sir, its tht largest .irctilutin in the county.'' Sirati'jcr'' What's the nens 7" Win i. i .Via" I tell you it' the largest circula- , tion anywhere around here." fit, u.yrr- -" You d ni't think there'll be draft in this eoumy, do you ." .Vmim Jni " Now I'll bet the drink I've got the bigger circulation lou any noospspi-r in the States." S'rwvfr " 1 dou't believe the war w ill end this winter." .Voo',1 .Viim Don't care whether you believe it or not publish the ouly noospaper that circulated' to speak of, on this continent." And thus the poor mania man ravos about hi noospaper" aud hi " eirculati." He evidently ha a chrunio, eomiound, double -and twitted " big circulation "in bi head I We pity him he has our heartfelt commiseration--and if we are ever o unf jrtunatu as to have so lar.je a " circula tion " that e can ueilber toll the truth or pay our honest debt, wj shall ask him to rcturu our ym pithv, -itU iotercit.
