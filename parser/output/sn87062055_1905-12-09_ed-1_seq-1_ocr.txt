No. 49 !( JOINT STATEHOOD That Is What President Roosevelt Orders Wants Four Territories Made Two States. President Roosevelt in his mes sage to congress, recommends that Oklahoma and Indian Terri tory be admitted as one state and that' Arizona and New Mexico be admitted as one state. The posi tion of the president comes as a surprise to everybody in Arizona, as the people of the territory have again and again been assured by Gov. Brodie that the president would give Arizona a fair deal. The following is the portion of the president's message regarding statehood for the territories: "I recommend that Indian Ter ritory and Oklahoma be admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. There is no obligation up on us to treat territorial subdi visions, which are matters of con venience only, as binding us on the question of admission to state hood. Nothing has taken up more time in the congress during the past few years than the ques tion of the statehood to be granted to the four territories above men tioned, and after careful consider ation of all that has been develop ed in the discussions of the ques tion, I recommend that they be immediately admitted as two states. There is no justifications for further delay; and the advisa btlity of making four territories into two states has been clearly established. "In some of the territories the legislative assembles issue li censes for gambling. The con gress should !) law forbid this practice, the harmful results of which are obvious at a glance." M. E.

December 25 to 30 Reduced Rail road Rate to Fair Miners' Drilling Contest. On account of the heavy rains causing floods in the Salt and Gila rivers and interfering with the transportation lines it was neces sary to postpone the fair and holi day week was decided upon as the best time, as this would give everyone an opportunity to take an outing and visit the capital city. The railroad companies have shown their deep interest in the success of the fair by making the low rate of :j4 cent per mile each way, and this will insure a big at tendance. The miners' drilling contest for the championship of Arizona promises to be well fiilled. The usual rules will apply: 8 pound hammers in the double contest and four pound in the single with seven-eigth (H) steel in both, Mr. Thomas Devine, of Bisbie, will be in charge of the cinterti and he is thoroughly familiar with the manner in which they should be conducted. Various exhibits are being re ceived, for-the fair, many being shipped the day before the post ponement was announced. The United Verde min-j exhibit, in charge of Mr. H. B. Brown, has been received and will na doubt be an attractive display. It will remain as a part of the permanent mineral exhibit. S2v5r.il of the counties have also sent their edu cational exhibits.
