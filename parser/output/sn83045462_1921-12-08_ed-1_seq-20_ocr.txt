SEES CONDITIONS BACK TO FOUR CENTURIES AGO Samuel Gompers' Criticism of Pres ident Harding's Suggestion of Court to Decide Wages. President Harding's proposal Tor a court with legal powers to decide aa to wages and conditions of employ ment. made In his message to' Con gress Tuesday, was characterized as a reversion back to conditions of 400 years ago, when the court of quarter sessions ruled in this capacity In a statement by President Gompers of the American Federation of Labor. The court of quarter sessions, he said in the statement, determined the wages of the workers and prohibited them from asking for more or em ployers from paying more than the court's decision, and could condemn men to compulsory servitude and slavery if they resented in any way the decisions of those courts. "Surely the President should have had these facts in mind," the statement added, "when he said It is not de sirable that the workers 'shall be per mitted to exact unfair terms of em ployment.' "The exactions of corporations are for private profit: the demand of the work ers for higher wages and better condi tions is an aspiration for better things, for a better day, and who is he who would attempt to curb the aspirations of the great mass of the people?" Mr. ('.ompers summarises the message of the President in general as "in most respects an admirable document." COL.
