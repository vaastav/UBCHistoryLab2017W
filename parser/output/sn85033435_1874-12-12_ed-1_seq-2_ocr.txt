"AND TRIBUKL 'CI JApKSON, Tenn. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 12, 1874. Tea reEsiDENT's Mkssaoe. We RUirc'Tiiler a largo portion o our space to-day to an altract' of this dcctl mcut. Its lei.glU jireveute.l us from giving it entire, but ve h.iTe enileaT ortd to present to our rc1ers all the prominent mutter rnintainci iu if. General Grant adheres to hi former policy, an J ha lanied but little from tLo lessons of the past year. Tbeictro.lnctiou of uiusictl iustril inonto, S1 orgracizatiou of choirs, in tlioprotenUnt cLurche-1, in the large lowrti and cities, within the post few years, h notably destroyed the once popalir and Tery attractive system ot congregational singing'. Have the churches bcea benefitted by this chango, either in their growth or In the interest of the member-) of the congregations iu their attendance? We think not. We are decided' iu favor of tue um of organs or other suitable instru saenU of music, and of choirs iu the ehuiche, but we think they have baeu changed .roin their original pur port wLi.li was simply that of iead- ra of ill music, aud that they have nsarped the entire conduct of this part of the service in moat of the churches, uud that this chaiigehas cot oly not boii beneficial to the char. hes in any way; but has actually worked an injury. Since the mem- - bf r-of -4Le . various coujxregatiooa liar ceased to join ia the singing, they havo yielded almost the only par- tieipatipn .they iuiva4a th-ihurch eer vices. Tills i certainly so iu all l th protest urxt churches which Lave uPliluals, (and we know of but oue Lich hat). This objection does not apply 60 aptly to the Roman Catholic church, because except in the mn-io, which in that church is usually con ducted by choirs, the congregation participate with the priost in the ser vices of the mass. Not so, however, with a majority of tho protestaut chur ches. The largo majority of the con gregatious there arc mere listeners to . the music, to the prayenand the fcer mon, aud bavc no part in the conduct of the services. From a secular point of view we think this matter is on of such im portance as to require a change, aud that the choirs should hi used mere ly to laud the congregation Ja the con duct of the musical services of the church, wliioh we presume will not be questioned was the original object ot their organization.

At Corinth, Mis tirgippi, oa aTonJay lost, at 1 o'clock, r. m., a bold and heavy bank robbery was elleetcd by a party of four armed taen, who had been in the vicinity of the plaos for several days previous. They seemed to be careless, dissipated and reckless men, bat their object was not supposed to be robbery or vio lence. Oa the day named, however, they rode np to the houso cccupied by Mr. A. H. Taylor as a bauk, which is an out of the way place, and two of them entered the building, leaving the other two to hold tha horses at the door. On entering they found no one inside except a negro named A n thouy Williamson, who was making a deposit with the bank, and tho pro prietor llr. A. U. Taylor. One ot the robbers askud the latter the price of gold. The banker told him that he could have it for ten o uts. The rob ber told him that ho must let him hava it for les. Thereupon Mr. Tay lor wns told to open the safe, and the kio wna ordered to stand still. Taylor hesitated, when he was cat across the forehead with a bowie knife. He then opened the safe, which was speedily cleared of its con tents. It is said that the loss , to the bank insludcs $'-5,000 ia money, about sixty gold and Bilver watches, dia monds, jewelry and other articles on special deposit, thai would usual ly bo gathered together in a half banking, balt-pawnbrokiug establish ment The horse-holders at the door pravc-tad interference from without, and iu a few moments the robbers had dona thair work, and were fiyiug from the setrne. They were followed for a " day or two, but tip to the time we write they are at large.

To tho Setr ate and lieuBo of Representatives Sinco tho convening of Congress one year ago, the nation his undergone a 

PROSTBATIOS IS UCSINE.SS A NO INDUS TRIE.' sr.eh as has not been witnes-od with us for many years. Speculation as to the causes for this prostration might be indulged in withont prolit, because, as many tbeorios would be advanced as there would bo independent wri ters those who expressed their own views without bearing upon the snb ject. Wittiout indulging in theories as to the cause of this prostration, I will only ctll your attention to the fact, and one question as to which it would seem thero should be no disa greement during this prostration, Two essential elements of prosperity havf been most abundant labor and capital. Both have been largely un employed. W here security has fcc'it, miJonbteil. eatiral ha been a1 tama ble at very modcr.it" rutea. Where labor Las been wanted, it ha3 been found in abundance at cheap rates compared with what necessaries and comtorts of life could bo purchased with tho waces demanded. Two great elements of prosperity, there fore, have not bceu denied us. A third might be added our soil and climate are unequale.d within the lim its of any contiguous territory under onc nationality, for its variety of pro ducts to feed and clothe a people, and in the amount ot surplus to opare to feed less favored people; therefore. with these facts, it seems to me that wise statesmanship at this session of Congress would dictate ignoring the post and directing iu proper channels these great elements of prosperity to any people. A great conflict for national existence made necessary for temporary pur puses, the raising of a large sum. of moncv from whatever source attaina ble. It Income necessary in the wis dom of Congress, and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premise, regard ing the necessity of the times, to de vise a system of national currency, which it proved to be impossible to keep on a par with the recognized eurrency of the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation, involv ing an extravagance and luxury not required for the happiness or prosper ity of a people, ond involving, both directly and indirectly, foreicm in debtedness. The currency being of fluctuating value, and therefore uu safe to hold for legitimate transac tions, requiring money, became a sub ject of speculation in itself. These two causes, however, have involved us In a foreign indobtodness, contract ed in good faith by borrowers and lenders, which should be paid in coin and according to the bond agreed up on wheu the debt was contracted gold or its equivalent. The good faith of tho government can not be violated toward creditors at the na tional disgrace. Our commerce should be encouraged, American ship build ing and carrying partly increased, for eign markets sought lor products of the soil and manufacturers to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where market can be created for the sale of onr products, either of the soil, tho mine or manufactory, a new means is discovered of utiliz ing our idle capital and labor to tho advantage of the whole people. Bat in my judgment the first xtr-p toward this obecl is to secure A Cl BHENCY GOOD WUE&EVEB CIVILI ZATION lLEIG.NS; one which, if it becomes superabun dant with one people, will And a mar ket with other. A currency which has as its basis tho labor necersary to produce it which will give its value. Gold and silver are now the recogniz ed mediums ot exchange tue world over, and to this we should return with the least practicable delay, in view of the pledges cf the American Congress, when our present legal teu der system was adopted and the debt contracted. A 

RETURN TO SFECIE TAIMKNTS. inenrst grand requisite to a re turn to rro8eritv is: tho lecal ten der clause to the law authorizing the issue of currency bv the National Government should be repealed, to take euect as to ail contracts entered into after a day lixed in the repealing act; not to apply, however, to the pay ment of salaries by the Government. or other expenses now provided by law to paid in currency. In the inter val pending between the repeal and the tinal resumption, provision should be made by which the .Secretary of the .treasury can obtain gold as it moy become necessary, from timo to time, from the date when specie resumption commenced. To this might and should be added 4 revenue sutlicient- ly in excels 01 expenses to insure an accumulation cf r--id in tha Treasury (ii tnatnin i.iumMr.n . FORKIGN AFFAIRS.

I would suggest ti Co!-grpn the propriety of readjusting tho tariff, so as to increase the revenue nnd at the fame time decrease the number of ar ticles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which cntor ii.to our manufactures and are not produced a home, it seem to me, should be en tered free Those articles of ma'iu factare which we produce a constitu ent part of, but do not produce should enter free also. JSVAB DrPABTJIE.ST. All the recommendations of the Secretary of War I regard as judi cious, aud I specially commend to your attention th? followiug: "Con solidation of Government arsenals, mileage to officer traveling under or ders, the exemption of money receiv ed troni the sale ef subsistence stores from being converted into the Treas ury, the use of appropriations for the purpose of subsistence stores, with out wuitin for the beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropria tions is made, fur additional a;qri pnatione, for the collection ol torpe do material, for increased appropri ations for the manufacture of arms, for relieving 1 he various States from indebtedness for arms charged to them during the rebellion, for dropping of Sicers Irom the rolls of the army with out trial for the oll'ense of drawing pay more than once lor the same pe riod, for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by checks, an i for the establishment of a lrofeBsor ship of lihetoric and Engli-.li Lit-ra-tai e at Wet Point. TUB NAVY. The efficiency of the navy has been largely increased during the last year undr the impulse of the foreign com plications which threatened us at the Cfimmn of tho 1 1-1 Fc-.-iori i-l Courvess. Mostof our efficient wood en siiips were put in condition for im mediate service, aud repairs of ou: iron-clad fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor. l'OSTAL, AFFAIRS. Next to our public schools, 1 lie postuificc is tho great agent of edu cation over our vast territory. The rapidity with which new kcc tions arc being settled up, thus in creasing the carrying of mails in a more rapid ratio than the incrca.-e of receipts, is alarmin?. Tliu re port of the Postmaster Gcner-I, herewith attached, shows that there was an increase of revenue in his department in 1873, over thotprevi ous year, of $l,G74,-ill, and u: in crease of the cost of carrying the mails or paying employees of $3,011, 407 91. The report of" the, Postmas ter General gives somo interesting statistics .of his Department, aud compared with corresponding sta tistics of a year ago show a growth in every branch ot the Department. - LOUISIANA AFFAIRS. On the 11th of September last the Governor of Louisiana called upon me, as provided by the Constitutiou and laws of the United .States, to aid in the suppression of domestic violence in that State. Tho call was made in view of a proclama tion issued on that day by D. B. Penn, stating that ho was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1872, and calling upon the militia of the Stato to arm, assemble and drive from power the usurpers, as he designat ed the officers of the Slate Govern ment. On tho next day I issued my proclamation, commanded the insurgents to disperse within live days from the date thereof, and sub sequently learned that on that day they had taken forcible possession of the State-house. Troops were taken by mo to support the existing anil recognized State Government, but betoro tho expiration of the live days tho insurrectionary move ment was practically abandoned, and the officers of the State govern ment, with some minor exceptions, resumed their powers and duties. Confiderinjj that the present State administraiiou ot Louisiana, had been, tho only government iu that State for nearly two years, that it has been tneltlv acknowledged and acquiesced i.l as such by congress, J and more than once expressly re cognized by me, 1 regard it as my clear duty, wnen legally called upon tor that purpose, to prevent Us over throw by an armed mob under pre tense ot fraud and Irregularities in the elect iou or 1872- I have hereto lore called tho attention ot cougress to the subject, stating that ou ac count ot the Hands and lorgeries committed at said election, aud be cause it appears that the returns thereof were never legally canvass ed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen; but Irom tho best sources of information at my com mand, I have always believed the present Stale officer received a ma jority of tho legal votes actually cast at the election. 1 repeat what I said in my special message of Feb ruary 13, 1873, that in tho event ol no action by congress I must contin ue to recognize the government heretofore recognized by me. I regret to say that with prepara tions lor tho late election, decided indications appeared iu some locali ties in the Southern States cf a de termination, by acts of violence aud intimidation, to deprive citizens of the freedom ol the ballot because of their political opinions. Hie whole number or troops 111 the States of Louisiana, Alabama, (ieorgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky. Teunes- I see, ArkA"0"-" ""isippi, AUry Jaiici and irginia, at the period of tue election, were 4,08a. This em braces the garrisous of all tho forts from tho Delaware to the Gulf ot Mexico. 

AHKA.VSAS. Another trouble has arisen in Ar kansas. Articio 13, of the constitu tion of the State which was adopt ed m lst3, upon the approval of wuicn oy congress tne State was re stored to leprescntation as oue of the States of the Union, provides in effect that, before any amend ments proposed to this constitution snail be made part thereof, they Biian 00 passed oy two successive assemblies and then submitted to and ratified by a majority of the c- icctors oi tue oiato voting therein. On tho 11th of May, 1874, tho Gov ernor convened an extra session of the itencrai Assembly of the State, which, ou 1110 loin 01 the same month, iaeu an act providing lor a voii ciuma iu irame a new con stitution. Parsuaiit to this set an election was held on the 30th of juue, 1?, tie Convention wss ap proved and ii. -Agates were chosen morcio. who u.jruibled 011 tho 14th vi w my auar lormea a new con stitution, tllC Schedule of which provided for the election of an en ure new pet t fctate officers in a contrary manner to the ihn rc- ing election laws of t lift Stttta An tho 13th of October, 1871. This constitution, ns therein provided was fubmitted to the teoil tbeir spprovl r rejection. ml ac cording to the election returns was approved -by a large majority of those qualified to vote thereon; and at tha same election persons were chosen to fill all tho Stato aud towaehip office.

CIVIL StllVlCE. The riden adopted to improve the civil service of the Government have been adhered to as closely as has been practicable Willi 1 he oppo sition wild which 1 hey meet, l'hc efl'ecl , I bciieve, bus been essential 011 the whole, and h is icnd-d to the elevation of the service, but it is impracticable to uiaiuiain them without tho direct Mid positive sup port of Congress. GOVERNMENT MANIPULATION. 1 would not sug gest as a remedy, direct subsidy to American steamship lines, but I would suggest the direct offer of ample compensation for carrying the mails between Atlantic and sea board cities uud the Continent, on American owned uud American built steamers, and would extend this liberality to vessels carrying the mails to the South American Slates and to Central America and Mexico, and would pursue the same policy irom our Pacific seaports to tho foreign seaports on the Pacific. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA In rny opinion tho District of Columbia should be regarded as the grounds of the Natiouul Capital, in which tho entiro peoplo aro inter ested. I do not allude to this to urge appropriations to the District, but to draw tho attention of Con gress, in framing a law for tho gov ernment of tho District, to the mag nificent scale on which the city wa planned by the founders of the Gov ernment: tho manner in which, for ornamental purposes, the reserva tions, streets and avenues ware laid out, and the proportion of the prop city actually posse. ;ed by the Gen eral Covemment. I think the pro portion of the expenses of tho Gov ernment aud improvements to be borno by the General Government, the cities of Washington and George town and the country, should be carefudy and equitably defined.

As manager of tbo gift concert given in aid of tbe Public Library of Kentucky my position creates an importtit trust in behalf of tho Publio Library and the tickethold crs of tho fifth gilt concert.
