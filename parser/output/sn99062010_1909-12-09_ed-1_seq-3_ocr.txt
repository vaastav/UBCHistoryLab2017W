u- 3 PRESIDENT TAFT DELIVERS FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE fie Favors Ship Subsidy, Postal Banks and Civil Service Pension Plan. HOT TOASTING FOR ZELAYA sS) Amendment of Interstate Commerce and Anti-Trust Laws, He An nounces, Will Be Handled in Special_ Message. LO •v-t Washington Special—Following Is a .eummary of President Taft's first annual message which was delivered to both houses of congress: After reviewing at considerable length the satisfactory relations be tween the United States and European .powers. President Taft takes up the ^relations between this country and -Latin-America, saying in part: Protect American Capital. Today, more than ever before, Ameri can capital is seeking investment in for eign countries, and American products are more and more generally seeking for eign markets. As a consequence, In all -countries there are American citizens and American interests to be protected, on -occasion, by their government. These movements of men, of capital, and of commodities bring peoples and govern ments closer together and so form bonds •of peace and mutual dependency, as they must also naturally sometimes make .passing points of friction. The resultant situation inevitably imposes upon this ^government vastly increased responsibil ities. This administration, through the •department of state and the foreign serv ice, is lending All proper support to legit imate and beneficial American enterprises Jn toreign countries, the degree of such support being measured by the national Advantages be expected. A. citizen himself can not by contract cr otherwise •divest himself of the right, nor can this government escape the obligation, of his protection in his personal and property rights when these are unjustly infringed In a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless vexations it is proper that in consider ing whether American enterprise should be encouragcd or supported in a partic ular country, the government should give full weight not only to the national, as •opposed to the individual benefits to ac crue, but also to the fact whether or not the government of the country In ques tion is in its administration and in its •diplomacy faithful to the principles of moderation, equity and justice upon which alone depend international credits, In diplomacy as well as in finance. The Pan-American policy of this gov ernment has long been fixed in its prin ciples and remains unchanged. With the •changed circumstances of the United States and of the republics to the south of us, most of which have great natural resources, stable government and pro gressive ideals, the apprehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be •said to have nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any •other doctrine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the perpetua ation of irresponsible government, the escape of just obligations, or the insidl '-•W °us allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United States. Beside the fundamental doctrines of our Pan-American policy there have grown up a realization of political in terests, community of institutions and ideals, and a flourishing commerce. All these bonds will be greatly strengthened as time goes on and increased facilities, such as the great bank soon to be estab lished in Latin America, supply the means for building up the colossal Inter continental commerce of the future. Meeting With Diaz. My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both American and Mexican soil served, I hope, to sig nalize the close and cordial relations which so well bind together this repub lic and the great republic immediately to the south, between which there is so vast a network of material interests. I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been set tled within the past few months, and that, under the enlightened regime now directing the government of Venezuela, provision ha3 been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal. On July 30, 18G9, the government of Pan ama agreed, after considerable negotia tion, to indemnify the relatives- of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having, in deed, been killed by the Panaman police this year. The sincere desire of the government of Panama to do away with a situation where such an accident could occur is manifest in the recent request in com pliance with which this government has lent the services of an officer of the army to be employed by the government of Panama as instructor of police. '•The collection of the customs of the Dominican republic through the general receiver of customs appointed by the president of the United States in ac cordance with the convention of Febru ary 8. 1907, has proceeded in an unevent ful and satisfactory manner. This government was obliged to inter vene diplomatically to bring about arbi tration or settlement of the claim of the Emery company against Nicaragua, which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settlement of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on September lo, 1909. Many years ago diplomatic intervention became necessary to the protection of the interests the ,VOIU8S_ny American claim of Asiop a,Pains't the government of Chile. There had been two abortive at tempts to do so through arbitral com missions, which failed through lack of jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the re sult of the recent diplomatic negotiations the governments of the United States and of Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cor diai and friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a protocol to submit the controversv to •definitive settlement by His Britannic Majesty, Edward VII. Zelaya Is Scored. Since the Washington conventions of 1907 were communicated to the govern ment of the United States as a consult ing and advising party, this government has been almost continuously called upon by one or another, and in turn by all of the five Centra! American republics to exert itself f«.r the maintenance of' the conventions. Nearly every complaint ha* been Against the Zelaya governor.', of Nica ragua, which has kept Central America In constant tension or turpioil. The re sponses made to the representations of •Central American republics, as due from the United Slates on account of its rela tion to the Washington conventions, have ,i been at all times conservative and have avoided, so far as possible, any sem blance of Interference, although it is very apparent that the considerations of geo graphic proximity to the canal zone and -of the very substantial American inter •4' «sts in Central America give to the «. United States a special position in the jzone of these republics and the Carib bean pea. I need not rehearse here the patient ef forts of this government to promote peace 'and welfare among these republics, ef tggfc. fort*, which are fully appreciated by the p. majority of them who are loyal to their true interests. It would be no less un nocessary to rehearse hero the sad tale •of unspeakable barbarities and oppres c^ion alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya government. Recently two ,Jf tAnvsrlcans were put to death by order of (SfiPresident Zeiaya himself. They were re- Sported to have been regularly commis sioned officers in the organized forces of sa revolution which had continued many "weeks and was proceeding in an orderly fashion in control of about half of the republic, and as such, according to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they would be entitled to bo •dealt with as prisoners of war. At the date when this emessage Is .- printed this government is proceeding •with deliberate circumspection to deter- iLa&arM mine the exact truth in relation to these reports and upon the course in the prem ises most consistent with Its di duty to American Interests and obligations to Central America and to civilization. The Fan East. In the far east this government pre serves unchanged Its policy of support ing the principle of equality of opportun- __ —inese empire, to which pol icy are pledged the interested powers of both east and west. By the treaty of 1903 China has under taken the abolition of likin with a mod erate and proportionate raising of the customs tariff along with currency re rorm. These reforms being of manifest advantage to foreign commerce aB well as to the interests of China, this gov ernment is endeavoring to facilitate these measures and the needful acquiescence of treaty powers. When It appeared that Chinese likin revenues were to be hypoth ecated to foreign bankers In connection with a great railway project, it was ob vious that the governments whose na tionals held this loan would have a cer tain direct Interest In the question of the carrying out by China of the reforms in question. Because this railroad loan rep resented a practical and real applica tion of the open door policy through co operation with China by Interested pow ?rs as well as because of Its relations to the reforms referred to above, the admin istration deemed American participation to be of great national Interest. Happily, when It was as a matter of broad policy urgent that this opportunity should not be lost, the Indispensable Instrumentality presented Itself when a group of Amer ican bankers, of International reputation and great resources, agreed at once to share in the loan upon precisely such terms as this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that Amer ican railway material should be upon an exact equality with that of the other na tionals joining In the loan in the placing After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last as,?ured. Government Expenditures. Perhaps the most Important question presented to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The deficit of the last fiscal year, and the certain deficit of the cur rent year, prompted congress to throw a greater responsibility on the executive and the secretary of the treasury than had heretofore been declared by statute. This declaration imposes upon the sec retary of the treasury the duty of assem bling all the estimates of the executive department's bureaus, and offices, of the expenditures necessary in the ensuing fis cal year, and of making an estimate of the revenues of the government for the same period and if a probable deficit is thus shown, it is made the duty of the president to recommend the methods by. which such deficit can be met. The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will ex ceed the estimated receipts by $3-4,075,620. If to this deficit is added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amount ing to $38,000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be in creased to a total deficit of $73,075,620. This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this proposal. The policy of paying for the construc tion of the Panama canal, not out of cur rent revenue, but by bond issues, was adopted in the Spooner act of 1902, and there seems to be no good reason for de parting from the principle by which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity who are tc enjoy it and there is all the more reason for this view because the actual cost to date of the canal, which is now half done and which will be com pleted by January 1, 1915, shows that the cost of engineering and construction will be $297,766,000, instead of $139,705,200, as originally estimated. In addition to en gineering and construction, the other ex penses, including sanitation and govern ment, and the amount paid for the prop erties, the franchise, and the privilego of building the canal, increase the cost by $75,435,000, to a total of $375,201,000. The Increase in the cost of engineering and construction is due to a substantial en largement of the plan of construction by widening the canal 100 feet in the Cule bra cut and by increasing the dimensions of the locks, to the underestimate of the quantity of the work to be done under the original plan, and to an underestimate of the cost of labor and materials both of which have greatly enhanced in price since the original estimate was made. .Low Estimates Made. Vi In order to avoid a deficit for the ensu ing fiscal year, I directed the heads of de partments in the preparation of their esti mates to make them as low as possible consistent with imperative governmental necessity. The result has been, as I am advised by the secretary of the treasury. lty and scrupulous"respect'for* ufelnteg- 'he reorganization of bureaus rlty of the Chinese empire, to which txSl- F*1 ,ln avoidance of it is gratifying that Americans will thus take their share in this exten sion of these great highways of trade, and to believe that such activities will S've a real Impetus to our commerce and will prove a practical corollary to our historic policy in the far east. In one of the Chinese-Japanese con ventions of September 4 of this year there was a provision which causcd con siderable public apprehension ln that upon its face it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a monopoly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and Antung-Mukden rail roads, and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enterprise, to take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough exam ination of the conventions and of the several contextual documents, the secre tary of state reached the conclusion that no such monopoly was Intended or ac complished. However, in view of the widespread discussion of this question, to confirm the view it had reached, this government made inquiry of the impe rial Chinese and Japanese governments and received from each official assurance that the provision had no purpose Incon sistent with the policy of equality of op portunity to which the signatories, In common with the United States, are pledged. Our traditional relations with the Jap anese empire continue cordial as usual. The arrangement of 1908 for a co-opera tive control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of revision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which is terminable In 1912 is already receiving the study of both countries. Department of State. 1 earnestly recommend to the favorable action of the congress the estimates sub mitted by the department of state and most especially the legislation suggested in the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to devel op and make permanent the reorganiza tion of the department upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thoroughly ef ficient instrument In the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American in terests abroad. The consular. service has been greatly improved under the law of April 5, 190G, and the executive order of June 27. 1906, and I commend to your consideration the question of embodying in a statute the principles of the present executive order upon which the efficiency of our consular service is,wholly dependent. The result of his work ln two or three •iti that the estimates of the expenses of the mates of the war department for the government for the fiscal year ending coming fiscal year, which brings the total June 30, 1911—that is, for the next fiscal year—are less by $55,663,000 than the total of appropriations for the current fiscal year, and less by $94,000,000 than the esti mates for that year. So far as the secre tary of the treasury is "able to form a judgment as to future income, and com pare it with the expenditure for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, including the payments on account of the Panama canal and the public debt, there will be no deficit ln the year ending June 30, 1911, ln all of which I concur, but the ooint but a small surplus of $712,000. 1 In the present estimates the needs of need for an elimination bill providing a the departments and of the government method by which the merits of officer* have been cut to the quick, so to speak, shall have some effect upon their ad and any assumption on the part of con- vancement and by which the advance gress, so often made in tiroes past, that the ment of all may be accelerated by the estimates have been prepared with the effective elimination of a definite Dronor expectation that they may be reduced, portion of the least efficient. There are will result ln s—* -~J administration. bureaus, which, If extended to the en- tire government, must occupy two" or more years, has been to show much room for Improvement and opportunity for sub stantial reductions In the cost and In creased efficiency, of administration. The object of the investigation is to devise means to Increase the-average efficiency of each employe. There Is great room ,n_ 'or Improvement toward this end, not duplication, but also in the treatment of the individual employe. Favors Civil Pensions. More than this, every reform directed toward the improvement in the average efficiency of government employes must depend on the ability of the executive to eliminate from the government service those who are Inefficient from any cause, and as the degree of efficiency in all the departments Is much lessened by the re tention of old employes wb» have out lived their energy and usefulness. It is lndispensible to any proper system of economy that provision be made so that their separation from the service shall be easy and Inevitable. It i« Impossible to make such provision unless tnere Is adopted a plan of civil pensions. Most of the great industrial organiza tions, and many of the well conducted railways of this country, are coming to the conclusion that a system of pensions for old employes, and the substitution therefor of younger and more energetic servants, promotes both economy and ef ficiency of administration. I am aware that there is a strong feel ing in both houses of congress, ana pos sibly In this country, against the estab lishment of civil pensions, and that this has naturally grown out of the heavy ill .. burden of military pensions, which it has dicy of our am strongly that no other practical solution of the always been the policy of our government ut I sr presi 11 servants can bs found than to assume but I am strong convinced difficulties presented by the superannu ation of civil servants can bs foun" that of a system of civil pensions. Frauds in the Collection of Customs. I regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in the col lection of the customs revenue at New York City, ln which a number of the subordinate employes ln the weighing and other departments were directly con cerned, and ln which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining com pany and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of duty on underweights of sugar. The government has recovered from the American Sugar Refining com pany all that It is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum was received in full of the amount due, which might have been recovered by civil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an express reservation ln the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not Interfere with, or prevent the criminal. prosecution of everyone who was found to be subject to the same. Criminal prosecutions are now proceed ing against a number of the government officers. The treasury department and the department of justice are exerting every effort to discover all the wrong doers, including the officers and em plyes of the companies who may have been privy to the fraud. It would seem to me that an investigation of the frauds by congress at present, pending the prob ing by the treasury department and the department of justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and otherwise prove an embarrassment in securing conviction of the guilty parties. Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference. By virtue of the clause known as the "Maximum and Min imum" clause, It is the duty of the ex ecutive to consider the laws and prac tices of other countries with reference to the importation Into those countries of the products and merchandise of the United States, and if the executive finds such laws and practices not to be unduly discriminatory against the United States, the minimum duties provided in the bill are to go into force. Unless the pres ident makes such a finding, then the maximum duties provided in the bill, that Is, an increase of 25 per cent ad valorem over the minimum duties, are to be ln force. Fear has been expressed that this power conferred and duty imposed on the executive Is likely to lead to a tariff war. I beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need be anticipated. The discretion granted to the executive by the terms "unduly discriminatory" is wide. In order that the maximum duty shall be charged against the imports from the country, it Is necessary that he shall find on the part of that country not only discrimination in its laws or the practice under them against the trade of the United States, but that the discrimina tions found shall be undue that Is, without good and fair reason. I conceive that this power was repesed in the pres ident with the hope that the maximum duties might never be applied in any case, but that the power to apply them would enable the president and the state department through friendly negotia tions to secure the elimination from the laws and the practice under them of any foreign country of that which is unduly discriminatory. No one Is seeking a tariff war or a condition In which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. Use of Tariff Board. The new tariff law enables me to ap point a tariff board to assist me ln con nection with the department of state in the administration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the government in the administration of the entire law. An ex amination of the law and an understand ing of the nature of the facts which should be considered in discharging the functions imposed upon the executive show that I have the power to direct the tariff board to make a comprehensive glossary and encyclopedia of the terms used and articles embraced in the tariff law, and to secure Information as to the cost of production of such goods in this country and the cost of their production in foreign countries. I have therefore ap pointed a tariff board consisting of three members and have directed them to per form all the duties above described. This work will perhaps take two or three years, and I ask congress a continuing annual appropriation equal to that al ready made for Its prosecution. I believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility and importance whenever congress shall deem it wise again to readjust the customs duties. If the facts securrd by the tariff board are of such a character as to show generally that the rates of duties imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the princi ples of protection as described in the platform of the successful party at the late election, I shall not hesitate to in vite the attention of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicated thereon. Nothing, however, halts busi ness and interferes with the course of prosperity so much as the threatened re vision of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after careful and deliberate Investigation, upon which such revision can properly be undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt it. The amount of misinformation that creeps into argu ments. pro and con in respect to tariff rates is such as to require the kind of investigation that I have directed the tariff board to make, an investigation un dertaken by it wholly without respect to the effect which the facts may have in calling for a readjustment of the rates of duty. War Department. In the Interest of immediate economy and because of the prospect of a deficit, I have required a reduction in the esti- estimates down to an amount $45 000 000 less than the corresponding estimates for last year. This could only be accom plished by cutting off new projects and suspending for the period of one year ail progress ln military matters. For the same reasc-i I have directed that the army shall not be recruited up to its present authorized strength. The secretary of war calls attention to a number of needed changes in the army upon which I place most emphasis is the po result ln seriously hampering proper in iinistration. It has been impossible in the prepara tion of estimates greatly to reduce the reason for a court-martial 'or~dismiJsar cost of permanent administration. This bur who do-not show such aptitude and can not be done without a thorough re- skill and character for high command as organization ot bureaus, offices, and de- to justify their remaining in the active partments. For the purpose of securing service to be promoted. Provision should Information which may enable the execu- be made by which they may be retired tlve and the legislative branches to unite on a certain proportion of their pay in ln a plan for the permanent reduction of creasing with their length of service at the cost of governmental administration, the time of retirement. There is now a the treasury department has Instituted personnel law for the navy which Itself an Investigation by one of the most needs amendment and to which I shall skilled expert accountants ln the United make further reference. Such a law is States. &Ci IlL w£i«« my predecessor, and I alBO urgently rec ommend the subject for consideration. Early in the coming session a compre hensive plan for the reorganisation of the officers of all corps of the navy will be presented to congress, and "1 hope It will meet with action suited to its ur gency. Expedition in Legal Procedure,'^ The deplorable delays in the adminis tration of civil and criminal law have received the attention of committees of the American Bar association and of many state bar associations, as well as the considered thought of judges and jurists. In my Judgment, a change In ju dicial'procedure, with a view to reducing its expense to private litigants ln civil cases and facilitating the dispatch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal cases, constitutes the great est need in our American institutions. I do not doubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty ex hibited in lynchings Is directly due to the uncertainties and Injustice growing out of the delays in trials, judgments ana the executions thereof by our courts. Of course these remarks apply quite as well to the'administration of justice ln state courts as to that ln federal courts, and without making Invidious distinction it is perhaps not too much to say that, speak ing generally, the defects are less In the federal courts than in the state courts. But they are very great in the federal courts. The expedition with which business is disposed of both on the civil and the criminal side of English courts under modern rules of procedure makes the delays in our courts Beem archaic and barbarous. The procedure In the federal courts should furnish an ex ample for the state courts. I presume It is impossible, without an amendment to the constitution, to unite under one form of action the proceedings at common law and proceedings In equity ln the federal courts, but It is certainly not impossible by a statute to simplify and make short and direct the procedure both at law and in equity In those courts. It Is not Im possible to cut down still more than it is cut down, the jurisdiction of the supreme court so as to confine It almost wholly to statutory and constitutional questions. Under the present statutes the equity and admiralty procedure in the federal courts is under the control of the supreme court, but ln the pressure of business to which that court is subjected, it is Impossible to hope that a radical and proper reform of the federal equity procedure can be brought about. I therefore recommend legislation providing for the appointment by the president of a commission with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of the federal courts of first Instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to the osed in itigants supreme court, and the costs Imposed in such procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and make fying and expediting the procedure as far as possible and making it as inexpensive as may be to the litigant of little means. Injunctions Without Notice. The platform of the successful party ln the last election contained the following: "The republican party will uphold at all times the authority and integrity of the coui-ts, state and federal, and will ever insist that their powers to enforce their process and to protect life, liberty, and property shall be preserved inviolate. We believe, however, that the rules of procedure in the federal courts with re spect to the issuance of the writ of in junction should be more accurately de fined by statute, and that no Injunc tion cr temporary restraining order should be issued without notice, except where irreparable injury would result from delay, in which case a speedy hear ing thereafter should be granted." 1 recommend that in compliance with the promise thus made, appropriate leg islation be adopted. The ends of justice will best be met and the chief cause of complaint against ill-considered injunc tions without notice will be removed by the enactment of a statute forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunction or restraining order, whether temporary or permanent, by any federal court, with out previous notice and a reasonable op portunity to be heard on behalf of the parties to be enjoined unless It shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the delay necessary to give such no tice and hearing would result in irrepar able injury to the complainant and unless also the court shall from the evidence make a written finding, which shall be spread upon the court minutes, that im mediate and irreparable injury is likely to ensue to the complainant, and shall define the injury, state why it is irrep arable, and shall also endorse on the or der issued the date and the hour of the issuance of the order. Moreover, every such Injunction or restraining order is sued without previous notice and oppor tunity by the defendant to be heard should by force of the statute expire and be of no effect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may fix. unless within such seven days or such less period, the injunc*'«n or order is extended or renewed after previous no tice and opportunity to be heard. My Judgment is that the passage of such an act which really embodies the best practice in equity and is very like the rule now in force in some courts will prevent the issutng of ill-advised or ders of injunction without notice and will render such orders when issued much less objectionable by the short time in which they may remain effective. Anti-Trust Commerce Laws. The jurisdiction of the general govern ment over interstate commerce has led to the passage of the so-called "Sherman anti-trust law" and the "interstate com merce law" and Its amendments. The developments in the operation of those laws, as shown by Indictments, trials, ju dicial decisions, and other sources of in formation, call for a discussion and some suggestions as to amendments. These I prefer to embody in a special message in stead of Including them in the present communication, and I shall avail myself of the first convenient opportunity to bring these subjects to the attention of congress. Postoffice Department. The deficit every year in il.e post office department is largely caused by the low rate of postage of 1 tent a pound charged on second class mail matter, which in cludes not only newspapers but maga Its voyage around the world, in more ef- telllrence which a low charge for carry flcient condition thtfl when it started, tag newspapers and periodicals assists.
