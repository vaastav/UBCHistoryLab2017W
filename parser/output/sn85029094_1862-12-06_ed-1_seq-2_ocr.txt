But it is upon the while man the "poo'rwhito trash" of the Slave States that Slavery rests with the most blighting power. Instead of a noble andiinielligeuU being, conscious of hit nWwn worth, with aspirations somewhat n accord with Ills immortality, he is a ' miserable, groveling, ignorant creatuie, hardly equal in intelligence to the com- nwu order of staves, aud totally unfit " to exerche the right of citizenship br "cause of l.is ignorance. t '.iso one can pass irom (he Free St.ues, a "herethe, benefits of tho Common i-1 School System are everywhere visible, into the Slave States, where such .Schools are only known in name, or ex- islasa "shadow without thcsubslauce," ;.and,roi be t-tiuck by the contrast.

The Presidents Message. This important document, a of which we have only seen a synopsis, which was received too late for publication this week, is now before the nation. i While it is said "it pleases nobodj-," it Ins, like all its predecessor, advocates and defamers, enemies and friends. We c;mnot speak of the message or its meats in detail at this time, but from the reading of the synopsis befooe us, we infer that in the main it is an able state paper, advocating measures found ed in wisdom nnd sound policy. Our relations with foreign powers snem to be as favorable as could reas onably be expected under all the cir cumstances. The president reiterates tho opinion expressed in his inaugural address.that it is impossible for (wo separate and distinct nations to exist iu peaceful re lations in that portion of the earth oc cupied by the people of the Unit.-d Slates. He then suggests amendments to tho Constitution, the first article of which, proposes, that all States abolishing shiv ery before January 1st, 1900, shall re ceive compensation flora the United Stales. Second All slaves freed by chances of war any lime before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free, but all owners who have not been disloyal shall be compensated. Third Congress may appropriate money :ind otherwise provide for the colonization of free colored persons. The President adheres to l.is Eman cipation proclamation, and says : "The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, mn but that the res toration of the national nutlioiiiy voM "be accepted without it, nor will the war or the proceedings under the proclaim-j tion of Sept 22d be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. The subject is presented exclu sively iu its economical aspect. The plan is proposed in peimtcent constitu tion a law." In conclusion the President says the dogmas of the great pt are inadequate to the stoimy present. The occuiou is Oiled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. The fieiy tiitl through which we pass will light us down an honor or dishonor to the la test generation. We say that we aie for the Union. The woihl will not for get that while we sty we do know how to avc the Union. In giving freedom to the slave we ensure freedom to the free -hunorbie aiike in what we git; and what wo preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of (lie eirlli. Oher means may suc ceed this could not fail. Tho way is plain, peaceful, generous; just a wny which, if followed, the world will for.-v- er applaud aud .God must forever bless . - Kansas New3.
