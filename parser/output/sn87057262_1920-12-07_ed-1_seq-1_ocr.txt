Local temperature, 7 p. m„- 38 7 a. m., 32. ., When addressed myself »o per forming the duty laid upoq the presi dent by the constitution to sreseit to you an annual report on the state of the union, I found myself domin ated by 4i immottal sentence cf Abraham Lincoln's, "let us have faith that right makes miglit, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand It," a sentence im mortal because it embodies in a form of utter simplicity and purit/ the essential state of the nation, the faith in which It was conceived end the faith In which "K baa arowo to "glory and power: With that faith and the birth of a nation founded upon it came the hope into the wor.'d that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of mankind, ^n order in which reason and riaht would take precedence of covetous nesa and force, aUd I believe that I express the wish and purpose cf every thoughtful American when I say that this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrange ments or our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influence upon tHe affairs of the world. By this *aith and by this faith alone, can the warld be lifted out of its present confusion and despair. It was this faith which prevailed over the wicked force of Germany. You will remember that the beginning of the end of the war came when the German people found themselves face to face with the con science of the world and realized that right was everywhere arrayed against the wrong that their government was attempting to perpetrate. I think, therefore, that it is true to say that this was the faith which won the war. Certainly this is the faith with which our gallant men went into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory. 

MISSION OF DEMOCRACY. This Is the mission upon which democracy came into the world. Democracy is an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treated Justly as against any attempt on the part of any combina tion 'of individuals to make laws which wifl overburden him or which will destroy his equaity among his fellows in the matter of right or privilege, and I think we all realize School for Newly Weds Has, Twenty Couples Attending First Class.

And in That Faith Let us Dare to do Our Duty as We Understand it, is Wilson's Inspiration. REPORT ON STATE OF Peace Treaty and League of Nations Not Men tioned by President in Final Message Ci to Congress. fUnited Press Leased Wire Service.] WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The text of President Wilson's message fol lows: that the day has come when .democ racy-is being put upon its final test. The old world is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the prin ciple of democracy and a substitu tion of the principle of sutscra^y «ts asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction of the multi tude. This is the time of all oihers when democracy should Drove its purity and its spiritual power to ore vail. It is surely the manifest des tiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit pre vail There are two ways in which the United States can assist to accom plish this great object first, by offer ing the example withip her own bon ders of the will and power of democ racy to make and enforce laws which are unquestionably just and which are equal in their administration laws which secure its full right to labor and yet at the same time'safe guard the integrity of property and particularly of that property which is devoted to the development of in dustry and the increase of the neces sary wealth of the world. Second, by standing for right and Justice as toward individual nations. The law of democracy is for the protection, of the weak and the influence of every democracy in the world should bo for the protection of the weak nation, the nation which' is struggling to wards its right and towards its proper recognition and privilege In the family of nations. The United States cannot refuse this role of champion without putting the stigma of rejec tion upon the great and devoted men who brought its government into existence and established it in the face of almost universal opposition and intrigue, even in the face of wanton force, as, for example, against the orders in council of Great Britain and the arbitrary Napoleonic decrees which involved us in what we know as the war of 1812. I urge you to Consider that the display of an imme diate disposition on the part of the congress to remedy any injustices or evils that may have shown them selves in our own national life will afford the most effectual offset to the forces of chaos and tyranny which are playing so disastrous a part in the fortunes of the free peoples of more than one part of the world. The United States is of neces sity the sample democracy of the world and the triumph of democracy depends upon its success. (Continued on page 2.) NO

I don't believe the American home is equalled any where in the" world. But I believe we ought to have more of tnem. "Everybody ought to have a home. It should be a hpme that would keep husband and wife home instead of out seeking a good time. "To keep them home there should be a boy and a girl. l"t is not a home until they have two children." Stifler said he would like to have every American woman realize there is nothing like a home. "It takes more brains to run a home than be a stenographer," he said. "A housewife has to have just as much braina as a business woman." Stifler said that instead of girls going to work in the business world they should stay home and help their mother®. "Girls study to be stenographers. I don't 1 see any 'reason why they shouldn't study to be housewives," he said: Stifler launched his school for newly-weds only a week ago.
