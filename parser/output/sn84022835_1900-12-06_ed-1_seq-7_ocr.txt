The Tnlplng rebellion uiul the opening of tho Chinese ports to foreign trade and settlement disturbed alike the huinngenlty and the seclusion of China. Meanwhile fotelK" activity made Itself felt In all quartets. t ulone on the coast, but along the groat river arteries and In tho remoter districts, carrying new Ideas and Introducing nw asoselatlons among u iirlmltlvu people which hail pursued for centuries a national policy of Isolation Tho telegraph and the railway nperadlng over their land, the steamers pi) lug on their waterways the inerchmnls nml the nilsloniitles pine t ratine cnr 1 enr tt the Interior be came, to the Chinese mind tyjies of an nllen Invasion, chnnglng the course of their national llfo and fraught with vague forrbodltiKH of dlauter to their beliefs and their self-control. Tor several yeals before the present troubles nil the resources of foreign di plomacy, backed by moral demonstra tions of tho physical forco of lleets and arms have been needed to .secure due respect for the treaty rights of for elKiiers and to obtain satisfaction from tho responsible authoiltles for the spo rndle outrages upon the persons and property of unoffending sojourners whleh from time to time occurred at widely separated points In the northern prov- lncts. as In the case of the outbreak In Szu Chutiu unit Shun Tung 1'ostlng of anti-foreign placards became n ilnllv neniirreiiei-. width the relienied reprobitlon of the Imperial power f'lllnl to check or punish. These Inllammutory appualR to tho Ignorunee and supersti tion of the, mnsius, mundarlous nnd nb mtrd In thtlr accusations and tleeply hos tllo In their spirit, could not but work cumulative harm. They aimed at no particular class of foreigner, they were Impartial in attacking everything for eign. An outbreak In Shan Tung. In which German mlslonurles were s I iln, was tho too natural result of these malevolent teachings. Tho posting or se ditious placards exhorting to the utter ilesit notion of foreigners and of every foreign thlnu continued unrebuknl Hos tile demonstrations townid the strnngcr gained strength by organization Tho sect, commonly ,stled the Uoxers, developed gicatly In the porvluces north of tho Yang Tse and with the collusion of many notable officials. Including some In tho Immediate councils of the throne Itself, became alarmingly aggressive. No foreigner's life outside of tho pro tected treaty ports was safe No for t eign Interest wuh secure from spoliation The diplomatic lepresentutlves of the powets in l'ekln strove In vain to check this movement. Protest was followed by demand nml demand by ri.nevved protest, to be met with perfunctory edicts from the palace and evasive and futile assur piich from tho tHting-ll-amen. The clr- cle of the Iioxcr Influence narrowed ", about Pekln, and while nominally stig matized as sudltlotis, it was foil tint tliu spirit pervaded tliu cupltal itself, that tho Imperial forces were imbuid with ItH doctrines and thut Immediate coun selors of the mpiess dowager were In full sjmputhy with the anti-foreign move ment. ' ... Tho Increasing gravity of the condi tions In China and tho imminence of peril to our own diversified Interests In tho empire, ns well as to those of nil tho other treaty governments, were soon appreciated by this government, caus ing It profound solicitude. Tho United Htntes, from the earliest days of for eign Intercourse with China, had followed a policy of pcuco, omitting no occnslon to testify good will, to further the ex tension of lawful trade to respect the sovereignty of its government nnd to in sure by all legitimate and kindly, hut nurnnal nionnu. the flllest measure Of protection for tho lives and property of our law-abiding citizens and for the ex crcUe of tholr beneficent callings sniong the Chinese people. Mindful of this, It was felt to be ap pioprlate that our purpose should be pro nounced In favor of such n course as would hasten united action of the pow ers nt Pekln to promoto the administra tive reforms so greatly neded for strengthening tho Imperial government and maintaining tho Integrity of Chlnn, " in which wo billeved the whole western world to he alike concerned. To these ends 1 caused to bo nddressed to the several powers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of Intluenco In China tho circular prnposuls of ist) Inviting fiom them declarations of their Inten tions nnd views ns to the desirability of tho adoption of measures Insuring the benefits or equality of treatment of all fornlgu trado throughout China. With grutlfilng unanimity tho re sponses coincided with this common pol Icy, t iiubllng mo to see In the .successful termination of these negotiations proof of the friendly spirit which animates tho various powers Interested In the untrnm meled development of commerce nnd In dustry of the Chinese empire as u source of viist boneflt to the whole commercial world. In this conclusion, which I hnd the Knttlltcutlon to unounco as n completed engagement to the Interested powers, on March So, 1900, I hopefully discerned a potential factor for tho abatement of the distrust of foreign purpoies, which for a year past hud apioured to Insplro the policy of tho Imperial government nnd for the effective exertion by It of power mid authority to quell tho crltlcnl nntl-forelgn movement In the northern a provinces most immediately Inllueuced " ihy tho Hunchu sontlment.

The mission compounds were nbnndoned. their Inmntes taking refuge hi the UrIMsh legation, where nil the other legations und gunrds gathered for more effective defense Kour hundred persons were crowded In its narrow compass. Two thousand nntlvo converts were assembled In a nearby pelace under protection of the foreign ers.

So thickly did the bulls rain that, when tho ammunition of tho be sieged ran low, live quarts of Chtneso bullets were pothered In an hour In ono compound and recast.

Not only nre the protestations of tho Chinese govern ment thut it protected and succored the legations positively contradicted, but Ir resistible proof accumuluti-s that tho at tacks upon them were mndo by Imperial troops, regularly uniformed, armed and ofllccred, belonging to the command of Jung hu, the Imperial communder-ln-chlef.

With the negotiation of the partial nr mlstlco of July U, a proceeding which was doubtless promoted by the representations of tho Chinese envoy In Washington, the way was opened for the conveyance to lr Conge.! of a test message sent by the secretary of stnte through the kind offices of Minister Wu Ting Tang. Mr. Conger's reply, dlspitehcd from Pekln on July IS through the same channel, afford ed to the outside world tho first tidings thut tho Inmntes of the legations were still nllvo'nnd hoping for succor. This news stimulated the powers for n Joint relief expedition ill numbers suffi cient to nveicomn tho resistance whleh for n month had been organizing between Taku nnd the capital.

Tho I'nlted Stntes contingent hnstllv assembled from the Philippines or dispatched from this country, amounted to koiiio fi.OOO men, un der tho nblc command first of the la mented Colonel htscum and afterward of Genernl Chaffee. Toward the end of July the movement began A severe conlllct followed at Tien Tsln, In which Colonel I.lscum wns killed. The city wns stoimed and partly de stroyed.

This reduction should be secured by tho remission of those taxes which vsprileiirc has shown to be the most burdensome to the Industries of the peo ple. I specially urge that there be Included In whatever reduction Is mndn the legicy tux, bequests for public uses of a literary, educational or charitable character. American vessels during the last threw years have carried ubout 9 per cent of our exports and Imports. Foreign ships shoulil carry the least, not the greatest, part of American trado. The remarknble growth of our steel Industries, the progress of ship butltTiitg for the domestic trade mil our steadily maintained expenditures for tho navy hnvo created an opportunity to pluce tho United States In the first rank of fommerclul maritime powers. Mesldes realizing a proper national as piration this will menu tho establishment and henlthy growth along all our coasts of a distinctive national Industry, ex panding the field for protltnble employ ment of labor and cupltal It will Inciease the transportation facilities and reduce freight charges on the vast volume of proelucts brought from the Interior to the senbowrd for export, and will strengthen an arm of the nntlouul defense upon which the founders of the government nnd their successors have rolled. In ngaln urging Immediate action by tho congress on measures to promote Amerleun ship building and foreign trade, I direct at tention to tho recommend itlons on the subject In previous messnges, und par ticularly to thn opinion expressed in the message of 1H9: "I um satisfied tho jiidgmont of tho country favors tho policy of aid to our merchant mmlnc, which will broaden our rommerce nnd mnrkets und upbuild our sou-cnrrylng capacity for tho jioO'j'ta of ngilculturo und manufacture, whloh, with the Inoionse of our nnvy, menu moro work and wnges to our count! ymen, us rU,as a safeguard to American Interests In every pnrt of the world," iitu attention of congress Is Invited to the ifc'iimmrudutlnn ut thn sccMtiuy nf the treasury lu his annual icport for leg islation In beliuir of the revniiiu cutter set vice, and favorable action Is urged.

Thnt there niuy be secured tlm best service possible! In thn Philippine IslniuU I have Issued, under (Into of November 10, 1900, thn following orde-r: "Thu United Stutes civil service com mission Is directed to render such as sistance us may be practicable to the civil service board, created under tho act of the United Stntes Philippine commis sion, for the establishment and mainte nance of tin honest und efficient olvil service in tho Philippine Islands, mid for that purpose to conduct examinations for tho civil service of tho Philippine Islands. upon tho request of tho civil sorvlco boa rel of suld Islands, under such regu lation us may be ugrocd upon by thu said board und thu said United Htntes civil service, commhiiilnn." Tho civil service commission Is greatly embarrassed In Its woik for want of an adequate! iicrmnucitl forco for clerical und other assistance, ltu needs lire fully set forth lu Its report. I Invite atten tion to the report, und especially urge upon tho congress that this Important bureau of the public service which pusses upon 11:3 qualifications und churuUer ot so lurge n number of the officers nnd cm plocs of lliu government should be sup ported by all bccsled appropriations to secure promptness and efficiency. I nm very much Impressed with (ho ntutement mude by the heuds of ull thu ilepnrtmeiits of the urgent necessity of u, hull of public records. In every depart mental building In Washington, so fur as 1 um informed, the space for offirlnl records Is not only exhausted, but tho walls of rooms are Hind with shelves, the mleldli! Hoor space of many, rooms Is tilled with file eases, und garrets nnd basements, which wero never intended, mid are unfitted for their accommodation, are crowded with them. Asldn from the Inconvenience there Is great dnnger, not only from lire, but from the weight of these records upon llmburs not Intended for their support. Them should be a separate building especially designed for the purpose of receiving nnd preserving; the annually accumulating archives of the Fovoral executive departments. Buch a hull nted not be u costly structure, but should be so urrmiged ns to permit of enlargement from tlmo to tlmu. I ur gently recommend thut the congress take, early action In this matter. The transfer of thn government to tills city Is a fact of great historical interest. Among the people there Is a fooling- ot genuine pride In the cupltal of tho repub lic. It is u matter of Interest In this; connection thnt In 1800 the population of the District of Columbia wus 14.093; toduy It Is 27S.718. The population of thn city of Washington wus then 3,210; today ft Is 218,190. Tho congress buying provided for "an appropriate nutlonal celebration ot the, centennial nnnlversury of the establish ment of tho scat of government in tho ! District of Columbia, the committees authorized uy it have prepnred a pro gram for the 12th of December. 1900, which dnte hns been selected as tho an niversary day. Deep Interest hns been shown In the arrangements for the cele bration by tho members of the commit tees of tho senate und house of repre sentatives, tho committee of governors appointed by the president, nnd the com mittees appointee! by the citizens nnd In habitants of the District ot Columbia generally. Tho program, In addition to a reception und other exercises nt the ex ecutive mansion, provides commemora tive exorcises to tie held Jointly by th senate and houso ot representative In the hull of tho houso of representatives, and a leceptlon In the evening ut thn Corcoran gullery ot art In honor of tho governor ot tho states and territories. in our great prosperity we must guard against the dunger It invites of extrava gance In government expenditures and appropriations, and tho chosen repre sentatives of the people will, I doubt not. furnish un exumple In their legislation of that wise economy whlcn In a season of plenty husbands for tho future. In this or u ot great business activity and opportunity cuutlon is not untimely, it will not abate, but strengthen conndonca. It will not retard, but promote legitimate IndiiHtiliil and commercial expansion. Our growing power brings with tt the complications nnd porlls requiring con stant vigilance to avoid.
