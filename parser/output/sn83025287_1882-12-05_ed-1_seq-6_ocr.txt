Tbe<Hobe on the Trains. i The Globe has always been supplied to the maws men on the trains, but at the previous size ♦ncounterel difficulties which do net now need to be recounted. At the present size it ought to be found ewryvhere. Parties who cannot in the future obtain it on the trains or of news dealers wi£ c er a favor by reporting the mat ter totois office with particulars. There is one positively painful and shocking passage in the president's mes sage. He intimates that the internal rev enue system of taxation can be socur tailed. As to retire two thousand office holders. Who will care for Barnard and Bickel now Let a day be appointed for weeping. The Globe has always maintained that Gov. Ramsey was the right man in the light place in being sent to Utah to cope with the Mormon question. President Ar thur fully agrees with the Globe, and shows his marked confidence in Gov. Ram sey's ability by making no recommenda tion whatever, but simply stating that the commission will be able to settle the affair. iThere is a personal magic, a sort of suaviter in modo fortiter hi re, about Bluffy Aleck, which captivates the polygamists (male and female) and they surrender at discretion. His suppres sion of that relic of barbarism will be a great moral triumph, and a handsome rounding off of a long, prominent and useful public career. 'In behalf of Gov. Ramsey's home friends, who for a quarter of a century have known and loved him, the^GLOBE extends congrat ulations, and returns thanks to President Arthur for the marked compliment of our esteemed fellow citizen which the message . records. 3PB ' THE GLOBEiAS A 

NEWSPAPER. The comprehensive character of the Globe as a newspaper is again well illus trated this morning. The lengthy mes sage of the President was telegraphed from Washington to the Globe yesterday In addition, summaries of department re ports, a full report of j congressional pro ceedings, the general news of the entire worldj and full market reports from all of the great business centers, came over the wire, and are herewith printed. All of this is supplemented by special letters relative to commercial and finan cial matters in New York and Chicago, brought by the Globe's special wire; an interview with Senator Vorhees by a Globe representative in Washington; a report of the famous Sturla murder trial by a Globe representative in Chicago, and numerous other gleanings of interesting events supplied by our superior special telegraphic facilities. Another notable feature is the simultane ous publication in this morning's issue of the Globe of the comments of this morning's iLondon papers upon the President's mes- i sage. Between twenty and thirty columns of telegraphic matter appear in this issue of the Globe, and all this is supplied without curtailing the space devoted to editorial matter, local intelligence and current ex tracts from exchanges.. Altogether, the'GnoßE invites the public to closely inspect its columns, compare with cotemporaries , and decide upon the merits of its claim to be one of the lead ing newspapers of the entire United States. -1 

STRANGE ADMIXTURE. Frank Hatton is assistant postmaster general, successor to [Brady, the alleged star route thief. Hatton has bought a newspaper in Washington, and is himself its managing editor, and the paper is the accredited and acknowledged organ of the administration and is the incessant lauda tor of Mr. Arthur. This is a strange and unusual specimen of political Mosaic. The assistant postmaster general, the owner and managing editor of a newspa per, which is the administration prgan, is, to say the least, an unusual political ad mixture. It would seem that no sense of decency or propriety has any restraint up on the present crop of officials, beginning with the chief executive, down, downwards. _x-Attorney GeneralMcVeagh say's: "Even to day, it is announced from Washington that Gotham has been retained as chief editorial writer of the administration or gan, of which the present assistant post master general is now manager. That is. Hatton succeeds Brady in the postoffice, also succeeds Mm in the organ of the administration, while Gorham is re tained as chief editor under both Brady and Hatton." Thus with the alleged star route thief (Brady), and Arthur's assistant postmaster general (Hatton) as managing editor] of the newspaper organ, and Gor ham as its chief editor, matters. seem. to be mixed in delightful kaledoscopic com position. In view of all this, a Republican exchange pithily re marks: "With Httton in Brady's, office, and also managing a , newspaper which in a breath lauds President' Arthur ; and curses the prosecution of Brady -■ and Dorsey, and with Brady's editor, Gorham, writing editorials for Hatton, the star route t thieves , and : the . president, 'X it •; looks as though i Attorney General,'' Brewster, may'; still be surrounded by snares, nitfalls and ; ' THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. | r "^a message of President Arthur, de'iv- j x* "•tigress yesterday, is a plain, bus- ( ere ... c. , ''uuejit. There is more prac- , ii;ess like do«_ -■- , .  . ■ . .  . «**» verbiage than is use- i tical matter and . " . J ii "uonents. i ally found in such doe v The feature of the-a." 8* 0 which will i The feature of tue me. » . attract the most attention, 7* T relative. ' to taxation and the tariff. Jf there | could be said to have been.any i doubt heretofore, relative to the lability to | make a sweeping reduction in taxation, ] that doubt would be removed by the fig- ; | ures now presented, The treasury is grow- , ing plethoric and oVerbuuiei'&l bj..t«? flow of money thereto from excessive tax- . ation. The fear that the president ex- ; presses that this state of affairs will pro duce official extravagance, will almost pro voke a smile. There has been little but extravagance and profligacy in the admin istration of national affairs for many years, and whea the Republicans had sweeping majorities in both houses no serious attempt was made to remove the burdens from the people. On the contrary, the iniquitous tariff was maintained in all its force. Now that the recent elec-. tions have placed the handwrit ing upon the wall so large and plain that it must be heeded both as a political necessity and as policy, the retiring party assumes a virtue, though it has it not, and professes a desire to give the people relief. If death-bed repent ance should result in some public good, it will be welcome. It is manifest, however, that the policy of the party which the president represents.is to follow the course indicated by the message of reducing do mestic taxation in order to save the tariff . as much as possible. As both parties are agreed that a very radical reduction of taxation is not only easily feasible but pos itively demanded, there ought not to be much difficulty in accomplishing some thing practical the present winter. The Globe cannot too highly approve the recommendations of the president for a reduction of postage. It is a gratifying announcement that the postoffice depart ment is self sustaining. The rule has been to show a deficit in this department of the government. The president is decidedly correct in stating that the postoffice de partment is not designed to be a source of revenue. The reduction of letter postage to two cents would result in such an increase of letters that no fear need be entertained of any material im pairment of the receipts. The president does not seem to be in entire harmony with his cabinet, for whiie the post master general advocates the postal tele graph in his report, the president emphat ically opposes it. The president is right. The recommendations relative to river and harbor improvements are also sensi ble. The unexpended balance in the treas ury of nearly eighteen millions shows the flagrant character of the vetoed river and harbor bill steal. The friends of the Mis sissippi river will do well to follow the president's advice, and bring in a bill on its merits. They are 6trong enough, and their cause is • meritorious enough, to secure what is necessary with out having a lot of swindling appropria tions make a rider of the Mississippi. The system of grouping needed and meri torious improvements and then throwing in steals to the aggregate amount of mil lions, in order to secure votes, is pernicious, and the comments and recommendations of the President in this respect, should lead to an entire change in the policy of securing such appropriations. The endorsement of the Pendleton civil service reform bill is clever. If we might quote Jolly Bagstock, we should say "it is slydevilish sly." This is a measure championed and introduced by a Demo cratic Senator, and if passed and made a law the present winter, would either result in the Republican officials being re tained, even if the Democrats elected their President in 1884, or else a Democratic congress would have to jump down its own throat by repealing the law. Here is a dilemma for the Democrats which the Republicans are not slow to see and improve. The Pendleton bill makes office holding almost a life tenure for those who are once fairly seated, and if the Dem ocrats should elect a president and find the Republicans on deck for life, there is danger that they might conclude that there is a good deal of humbug and clap-trap in the hue and cry "for civil service reform which they now evidently regard "a good enough Morgan until after election." The country would be likely to survive, how ever, even though there might be political wailing and gnashing of. teeth. Of course the President thinks there is too much silver. He represents the views of Wall street and Wall street can make more money for itself and less for the peo ple by having the gold standard alone. It will be a bold Congress, however, which will have the temerity to taboo the de velopment of so important a mineral as American silver. Taken as a whole, the Globe finds much more to approve^in President Arthur's f ul mination than to criticse. As it is one of the closing papers of the Republican party which is soon to go into permanent retirment, it has a flavor of virtue which it is pleasant to commend. It is not often that a presi dent can accept his party death warrant so gracefully. 

TAXATION. England and many other nations, are supposed to be buried deeply under the burden of taxation, and the supposition is a correct one. The people of this country are wont to felicitate themselves on the assumed idea, that however heavily we may be taxed, we are not weighed down as the older nations are. A slight compari son of figures will serve to correct some mistaken views on this head. Let the army appropriations of the United States be compared with the military expenditures of other countries, where large standing armies are maintained. At our last session of congress, for the fiscal , year ending June 30, 1883, the appropria tion for the support of the army and for the payment of . military pensions was $143,032,000, and it is estimated that this amount must be largely increased from year to year, for some time in the future. .' We rate our population at 50,000,000. Now, institute a comparison with Eng land^' with a population of 34,000,000. Her expenses for army and pensions are $85, -000,000. Take Germany, with a popula- ' tion of 43,000,000, # expenses . $104,- : 000,000 to , maintain, its military ' establishment. Austria, with a population ' of 37,000,000, expends $55,080,000. Italy, ' .with j a .population of .28,000,000, expends $50,000,000 for army and pensions.; France, \ with a population iof 37,000,000, expends ; for army and»pensions $113,000,000. "i THE ST. PAUL DAILY GLOBE, Tt DiV MORNING, DECEMBER 5, 1832 that the United States, with i its population of 50,000,000 is taxed per ' capita far more than are the other nations with their standing armies and oft-recur- '■ ring wars.

TKXXYSOX'S PLAY. * die Uproarious Way in Which It Was Re g ceired by a London Audience. The utter failure of the poet laureate's new play is the talk of London. The crit ics devoted columns to the history of the failure. Some are apologetic, others sad, while some make merry over it, but Till agree as to the downright failure of the piece. Poor Mrs. Bernard Beere.the lessee of the Globe theater, had no doubt thought herself fortunate in opening her season with a play from the laureate's pen. The rehearsals had been careful, the scenery was beautiful, the music was good, the the very programme was novel and artis tic; money and taste was freely expended and the melancholy result was ridicule. The public nocked to the theater with eag er anticipations and sat through the first »3ene with minds predisposed to reverent al enjoyment; they left it with jeers and laughter. As for the "gods" they merci lessly "guyed" the piece from the moment that failure was apparent, and it became apparent very early in the first act. It was a great disappointment. The name of the play was —"The Prom ise of May;" and, as though to increase the interest, the following pretty lines by the author were printed on the programme The town lay still in the low sunlight, The hen cluct late by the white farm gate, The maid to her dairy came in from the cow, The stock dove coo'd at the fall of night, The blossom had opsu'd on every bough— O joy for the promise of May, of May, O joy for the promise of May! But a red fire woke in the heart of the town, And a fox from the glen ran away with the h'n, And a cat to the cream, and a rat to the cheese, And the stock dove coo'd till a kite dropped down, And a salt wind burnt the blossoming trees O grief for the promise of May, of May. O grief for the promise of May! THE SUFFERING ACTOBB. Next to Mrs. Bernard Beere, the greatest sufferer was Mr. Hermann yezin, who had to bear the brunt of the displeasure and "chaff" of the gallery. The abominable sentiments which, he has to utter fairly ex asperated the orthodox portion of the au dience, and their unsuitability to the stage moved those who recognized the dramatic intention of the author to inextinguishable laughter. Poor Mr. Yezin had to repre sent the gentleman-villian who comes to the happy farm in Lincolnshire presuma bly, but the rustic dialect was a little mixed — in spite of the strong objec tions to him entertained by all the clod hoppers, Farmer Dobson at their head, se duces Eva, one of the two daughters of Farmer Steer. And then, when she urges marriage: "Marriage," says he, "that feeble institution. Child, it will pass away with priestcraft from the pulpit into 'the crypt, into the abyss; for does not nature teach us that marriage is against nature? For look at the —they pair for the season and part, but how merrily they sing; while marrying, as some one says, is like chain ing two dogs together by the collar; they snarl and bite each other because there is no hope of parting." Then he leaves her, saying he will write. Another of this gen tleman's sentiments runs as follows: "Mar riage in itself. Well, when the great dem ocratic deluge which is slowly coming upon us and all Europe shall have washed away thrones and churches, ranks, conditions and customsmarriage, one of the most senseless, among the rest—-why then the man and the woman being free to follow their elective affinities will each bid the old bond farewell, not with tears but with smiles, not with mutual recrimina tion but with mutual good wishes, with no dread of the world's gossip and no necessity for concealment; and the childrenwell the state will bring up the children." FITS OF SCOBNFTJL HILABITT. : These soliloquies, clearly delivered by Mr. Vezin (who unfortunately did nat look young and attractive), were met with derision, and in the next act (six years hav ing elapsed in the story) when he auietly marches on to the same spot again he was received with a burst of laughter. Why the heartless seducer should come back to the scene of his villainy is hard to under stand, but he is supposed to be repentant and consumed with a desire to make amends for his cruelty. His method of making amends is peculiar and goads the audi ence into another fit of scornful hilarity. He meets D%\i, the sister of his victim, on the "bridge by the hay field" and makes love to her. When she has gone off in a flutter of delight * he delivers another as tounding soliloquy: " "Surely, surely, 1 must have loved Eva far more than I knew, for the-past looked through the present in her eyes, Eva's eyes through Dora's. They worked a charm upon me and I feel, or. I • could feel, as much of what they call love . for this Dora as for any woman I ever met. [Here there was a roar from the audience.] ' More, perhaps, if I except Eva, poor Eva, • poor, dear, dead Eva.drowned through me. ' To make amends I will wed this Dora, if '■ possible. • [Renewed yells from the gal- i lery and bursts of laughter from the stalls , and boxes.] I will make her at least happy and the father's old age comfortable. It ' seems this is worth my while if I wish to be at peace myself. Is that absurd? ['Rather,' from the gallery.] • Some of my friends would say so, but how can I help moving in the line of least resistance when the stronger motive rules?" It was all up with the play after that. Heavy Failures. Philadelphia, Dec. 4. —The property of C. S. & J. P. Jones, proprietors of the Cal cutta Cotton mills, Frankfort, were levied upon, for a judgment amounting to $389, 944. Other debts were estimated at 70,000. The principal creditors are Jones, Warner, & Co., commission merchants, of this city, and Chas. F. Jones, father of C. S. <fc J. P. , Jones. The value of the mills and machin ery is estimated at $200,000, and the stock about as much more. The cause of the trouble is said to be over production, and ' the usual winter dullness in the cotton trade. ' Pobtland, Me., Dec. 4.—A: meeting of < the creditors of David W. .

The Defendant Seized With ■ Convulsion on the WiteeM Stand Four or Five Strong Men Required to Hold Her—A Clergyman Knocked Down and Kohhed in the Streets of Chicago — Woman of Little Sauk Village, Minn., Shoots Her Husband—-Marine Disasters and Fires. . • THE STUBLA TBIAL. I Special Telegram to the Globe.l Chicago, Dec. 4.When Theresa Sturla came into the court room this morning, it was noticed that for the first time since the trial began her face was wholly uncovered. This was very soon discovered by all pres ent, and at ence every one leaned forward to get a gsod look at the features of the woman who shot Charles Stiles. Mr. Trude ' asked her to take the witness stand, after the examination of Joseph Gill, a bar tender at Snnnyside, had completed. This created a sensation. It had not been ex pected, at least at that time, and every one appeared surprised. Theresa Sturla walked to the witness chair and seated her self with composure. The gaze of Mrs. Stiles, the mother of the murdered man, rested on the face of his slayer, and ex cept as she leaned forward to prompt Mr. Mills, or to make some suggestion to the state's attorney, her gaze was scarcely removed during the entire morning. The latter was dressed in black, as heretofore. Her gloves were removed, and she held a white handkerchief, which she alternately twisted in her hands and raised to her face. She told her story very clearly, using the best of language, and spoke so a* to be plainly heard. Occasionally her bosom heaved and her voice seemed to be affected, as if she was overcome by the recital of the wrongs she had suffered. "What is your name?" asked Mr. Trade. "Cava a Theresa Sturlata." "Where is your home ?" "I have no home,"' "Where did you meet Charles Stiles?'' "In Baltimore, at the house of Mrs. Fay." "When?" -".. "In 1877, during the races. I was placed at the house of Mrs. Fay by the man who seduced me. I lived at the house with this man, as his mistress." "State what took place between you and Mr. Stiles?" "I was playing on the piano and singing when Mr. Stiles was introduced to me. He talked Italian to me and came to see me there quite often, and made my lover jeal ous, so that when Mr. Stiles continued to come to see me he would not marry 4 me. Then Charley stopped there with me and afterward went away, and then in July,'lB77, he came back. He had lost all his money at the races; he didn't have any when he came back. He brought his trunk J and stopped at the house with me for another week. ,■ Then when he . went., away I " gave him $200 to play the races, and after that he wrote-to me from different , places, full of love, and once in a while he would send for more money. -I would send it to him to different places. He then be gan writing to me to come to Chicago, and at last I did so, in June, 1878. The prisoner occupied the witness stand ' until 4:15 o'clock, and had brought her story down to the fatal night, when j just as she had recited her treatment at Sunnyside and her return to Chicago to kill her lover, she broke down and wept. In a moment she had fallen to the floor and was writhing in a convulsion, the ef- ' forts of half a dozen men being insufficient ' to hold her. Her shrieks and cries added ' to the excitement, and judge, jurors and ( spectators rose up to better see the pain- ] ful sight. The court ordered her taken to her cell to recover, and ad j ourned for the day. :-; , A CLEBGYMAN BOBBED. . I Special Telegram to the Globe. 1 j Chicago, Dec. 4.As Rev. Dr. S. H. Mead, the rector of the Emanuel Episcopal church, and assistant pastor of Christ -, church, was returning from a service at ( Emanuel church, and when at the corner , of Stewart avenue and Tinnell street, he ' was assaulted by two roughs, who knocked j him down, beat him in the side and abdo ' men until he was unconscious, and then 1 robbed him of a gold watch and chain 1 worth $50, a check for $30, letters, ' memoranda, etc., and a purse contain- l ing $29 in cash. As soon as he regained consciousness, Dr. Mead arose and made his way to the house of a friend, i thence to the police station, where he re- 1 ceived needed attention, and was taken to 1 his rooms at the Southern hotel. A physi- ( cian was summoned, and after an exami- f nation said no ribs had been broken, though Dr. Mead is of the opinion they sustained some serious injury. The kick in the abdomen is the most painful. There c is no clew to the assailants, and Dr. Mead ■ is certain he would not recognize them, as 'I it was very dark. FEBGUS FALLS CEIMINAL BECOBD.

[Boston Courier.] I had been at dinner. There were a. lot of good fellows there. They were dining another good fellow, who was going away. We dined him, we wined him. The sitting was protracted. It was a very damp night. It was a humid night. It was a demnition moist night. And then as the night was liquescent, and the star dials hinted of morn, I be thought me of home. It is a great thing to have a home. They say that in the French language there is 'no word for home. Home, sweet home. 'Tis sweet to hear the watch dog's honest bark. And all that sort of thing. But then, sometimes you don't want to 1 go home. v 7 I didn't want to go home. But I. was afraid to slay away. So I took a cab and my homeward route together. When I reached my stately mansion I ditmissed the cab, and reflected. Was lin fit condition to appear at the domestic bar ; that awful tribunal? I determined to think it over. En reflechant, I took a walk 1 around the block. I thought I must pass off my hiccoughs for heart disease, or something like that. . Something something dangerous. Apoplexy might do.' But no. I smiled sadly as I reflected ' that Zulana knew me pretty well. She was 1 too familiar with the symptoms of my projected heart disease. I cautiously unlatched the door, with ■ some little trouble. When within I paused again. I think I see the cynical smile upon the face of some beardless bachelor. ; Ah, little reek ye, ye mateless ones, of— . but no matter. When I entered the hallway I recoiled. A man stood before me. He was a tall and ugly looking customer in the dim light. But I soon saw that I had been mistaken. It was only a most hideous suit of Japnese armor, which is the very apple of Zulana's eye. A bright idea struck me. Why wouldn't it do for me to don the toggery of the de funct daimaio? Thus accoutred I would enter tho chamber of Zulana* I would sur prise her. I would then explain. In the midst of the laughter, the slight yet pleas ant glow created by my little joke, my late arrival and my hie cough would perhaps pass unnoticed. Happy thought. . I began the taskofendossing the armor. It was longer and more difficult than I had anticipated. How in the name of all that is inflammable those Japs ever got their armor on without bursting a blood vessel is more than I can guess. However, at last I got into the thing and started upstairs. I trod as gently as I could, but when I entered the chamber where Zulana lay enshrined, my helmet prevented me from seeing distinctly. I tumbled over an ottoman, and came to the floor with an awful crash. I rose with much difficulty, but I had scarcely got upon my feet when I was startled by the most awful, the most blood curdling shrieks I ever heard in my life. It was Zulana. Apparently the wife of my bosom had failed to see the joke. I advanced toward her, and endeavored to explain, but she fled from before me— even in her garments of night fled she, like a ghost through the hallway.,,.; fjl followed, entreating her to be calm. But she only shrieked the louder. When I reached the foot of the stairs, she had evidently fallen back for re-in foreaments. She appeared presently flanked by the 000k and the housemaid. But my arrival threw them into disorder, and they fell back. I made a short and impressive speech from my post at the foot of the stairway. I did it with as much dignity as was com patible with my raiment. I implored them to be calm. Already a policeman was knocking at our portal. Finally I succeeded in quieting these insane creatures. But I had a long and very elaborate series of explanations to make. First to the policeman. He was firmly convinced that a murder had been committed, and that the body was secreted on the prem ises. It took much time to remove this impression from his mind, and to convince him that my wife was a sleepwalker, and that I had been to a masquerade ball. Next the servants. My ordinarily digni fied intercourse with them was much im paired by reason of my attire. Last came Zulana. I will not dwell upon this painful scene.. Suffice it to say that what I endured that night would have made the early Christian martyrs think their tor ture were as naught in comparison. When I thought of those whom Nero had dipped in oil, kindled and used .as a torchlight procession, I laughed bitterly. lam still of the opinion that my little ; scheme was an excellent one, and that it ! had in it all the elements of a side-split ting joke. With almost any other woman it would have succeeded perfectly. But lam free to confess that I shall never try it with her who is the present yokemate of Zulano. An Accommodating Cross. "Isom, I understand that you have taken , out license to preach?" said an Arkansaw colonel to an old colored man. "Yes, sir; Pse 'cided to preach de Lord . an' Him crucified.

In certain English communities, Mrs. Stowe, author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," is, believed to be a colored woman. Such is fame. The New York attorney general has ren dered an opinion that the charter of the New York Life Insurance company is per petual.

According to "Gath," not one woman in 10,000 will tell the president anything to his disparagement, because he has such handsome eyes. And because he is a wid ower, it might be added. .

It is ascertained that Jersey Ci ty bonds to the amount of nearly $1,000,900 have been illegally sold at a price below that prescribed by law, to a syndicate of city officials, with the intent of defrauding; the city.

A large farm in Berwickshire was recently re-let at $3,000, after having for many years commanded $4,650. This is a re duction of about 35 per. cent.

' An old wrangle upon whether colored" children shall be admitted to the public schools has broken out afresh in Pitts burgh. The leading newspapers of that city advocate separate schools, and the colored people are profoundly disgusted thereat, as they have a right to be. The Rev.

Dr. Manning became the. a ssociate pastor of the the Old South church about twenty-five years ago, repre- - senting the anti-slavery elements of the congregation, while his colleague, the Rev. Dr. Blagden, represented the opposite. It is a remarkable feature of the elec tions of 1882, that the Democrats elected governors in Massachusetts, Michigan, Kansas and Colorado, and by a large ma jority in each case, when the regular Re publican ets for other state officers were ■> all elected by nearly the usual parte ma jorities.

Her citizens declare that while the present law affords infinite comfort to murderers and those sentiment alists who profess to have greater sym pathy for the criminal than for his victim, its constant tendency has been to increase the number of killings. Mrs. Tevis, of St. Louis, lived in the be lief that sin concealed was scarcely sin at all. But she has wakened to the fact that vengeance stalks close behind the guilty,, and that when the time is ripe the blow descends. The foolish pleasure of a guilty love is nothing beside the awful shame that now overwhelms her, and a sorrowing fa ther, a ruined home, a disgraced family, are. only part of the costs she must pay for her indfielity. Collector Robertson, of the New York custom house, has received $46,421 as head tax on immigrants collected at the port of New York during the past three months, under the provisions of the law passed at the last session of congress,/.", which imposes a tax of fifty cents each on i every immigrant brought to this country.
