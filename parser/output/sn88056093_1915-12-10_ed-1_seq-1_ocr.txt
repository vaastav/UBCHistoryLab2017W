"The utility of history", wrote Lord Chesterfield to his son, "consists principally in the exam ples it gives us o£ the virtues and vices of those who have gone before us; upon which we ought to make proper observations. His tory animates us and excites us to the love of the practice of virtue; by showing us the regard and ven eration that was always paid to great and virtuous men, in the times in which they lived, and the praise and glory with which their names are perpetuated, and trans mitted down to our times, are the characters that you should imitate, if you would be a great and good man, which is the only way to be a happy one!"

At the present time one of the things which is harmful to townsmen is the mail order business. This is something that we should look into and think about, fori really think that it hurts us all, even those who indulge in this, for I think that they really do not get as good material for the money and trouble expended on getting it that way as they would if they patronized their own town. Taking the other side of it, they say they have to pay too much for those things here. The question is do they pay more than they would if they bought in the east, and paid the express, etc., and are they getting as good or better grade of goods in doing so. I wish we would all look Into this and see for ourselves and com pare with one another. There is one real detriment that I our our to the the and of to decide. There are only a few places I that are thrown open free to the can see at the present time in this way of buying and that is we are sending a great portion of the money which we earned in this community to eastern capitalistic concerns and in turn it is interests and as a result they profit, We don't even get the of is Invested in eastern none of us do. value of our money expended, but that is neither here nor there, people, but the thing for us to do Is to get together on this matter and see IT there Is some better way of helping another as well as ourselves. There is the friendly and Interest ing debate that helps people to decide which is best, gives us an opportuni great amount of one ty to hear information, which has been gained by experience and study.
