LOXDON, Dec 11. If the rural confer ence which opened yesterday in London iepretented with absolute fidelity the spirit of the agricultural element of G eat Britain, the country would be on the eve ofufcocial and political revolution, o assemblage of supposedly representative men ever held in England displayed such envenomed hostility to the parsons and land owners. The delegates boasting themselves as persistent parson fighters - und denouncing bquiro tyranny were cheered to the echo, and their scornful allusions to the patronizing airs of the clergy to the rural inh hitautswere keenly relished. Occasionly a delesate feebly ad mitted that he had met a liberal landlord or an open-minded cleric, but the entire sympaty of the conference was reserved for the motto "Down with the church and the landlords." The conference, while in dicating clearly an actively existent force to be accounted wit li in the coming elec tions, owes its greatest importance to its foreshadowing the future agricultural policy. "When the spirit of the delegates permeates the electoiate, the hereditary privileges of landlordism and churchism will vanish. Mr. Gladstone's speech today was a dls tinct disappointment, many of the dele gates expecting that definite assurances In regard to Liberal progress would be de clared, and would include some of their aspirations. Some men who urged the immediate application to England of the principles ot fair play for rent, fixity of tenure aud free sale, and others who waut e"d the abolition of primogeniture and a limitation as to the size of estates, got only enlarged allusions to the Newcastle program. "Mr. Gladstone spoke through out as a leader who was sympathetic, but was doomed not to lead iu a struggle in which uewas most concerned. The chair man's incidental reference to Mr. Glad stone's projected trip to Barritz as a "iournev to that beautiful laud" was mis- iuternrettd by tho audience and brought tears'to many eyes. Mr. Gladstone's own allusion to the limitation of hia physical powers and his sensibility of the disad Tantage in which his party was placed, owing to his advanced years, caused re newed emotion among his hearers. There were many cries of "No, you will have a long life yet, etc. Mr. Gladstono and wife will start on their trip on Tuesday. His medical ad viser, Sir Andrew Clarke, insists upon per fect rest. Mr. Gladstone's criticism of Chancellor Goschen's one-pound note scheme, has killed the chances of the hill in parlia ment. ENGLISH LIBERALS. LONDON, Dec. 1L Four hundred of the rural delegates to the national Liberal fed eiation conference, which opened yester pay iu Memorial hall, Farnngton street, partook of a breakfast this mornint;, at which the principal guest was Mr. Glad stone. The great Liberal leader was ac companied by his wife. "When Mr. aud Mrs. Gladstone entered the great room in which tho breakfast was given, there was n scene of great enthusiasm. The dele gates rose to their feet, and. with one voice, cheered their leader. After the delegates aud their guests had partaken of breakfast, Mr. Gladstone ad dressed t hem. He said that ho was re joiced to see that tho conference was at tended with unity, moderation and decision, which ho declared, were tho sure precursors of victory. Mr. Gladstono said that he thought the time had come for the commencement of continuous efforts to bring about rural reforms, and, he added, these efforts ought not to terminate un til their just ends had been attained. Speaking of the subject of labor Mr. Gladstone said that tho labor question had a wide range. Home rule was a part of tho labor controversy, as the bulk of those in whoso behalf they were strugg ling were laborers or small farmers. The condition of tho rural laborers was a most urgent question. The proof of this state ment lay m the constant migration of the laborers. Every endeavor ought to be made to keep tho laborers at home. Ho hoped to see labor candidates for feats in parliament iucrease In number, and they ought not to bo saddled with frightful election expenses. Mr. Gladstone urged the abolition of the law against conspiracy. This law, he said, had given rise to proceedings that were ndveifo to the liberties of tho people. Speaking with particular reference to this law, Mr. Gladstone said: "Wo must pro vide for the rural population of Great Britain, as well as for tho saroo clas iu Ireland. Nothinc must be a crime which relates to the prosecution of labor inter ests, or because it is done by a combina tion of men, unless it is an offense against the letter and spirit of law." Mr. Gladstone stronsjly advocated that parish couueils should see that schools and dwellings were in proper sanitary condition. Ho said that some scheme ought to bo devised to offer tho laborer nfter a long aud blameless life something better than tho workhouse. Until that was done society would not have dis charged its duties and the aims of the present conference would not bo fully at tained. A 

ROYAL BETROTHAL. LONDON, Dec. 11. The arrangements for the marriage of tho duke of Clarence nnd Avoudale were, it is understood, discussed by the cabinet today. Although the ict of 1SS9 bars a sprcml grant to the duke, the ministers hold that a dowrv can be voted to the Princess Victoria "Mary The priuce of Wales will visit the queen i indsoron Monday, to state the inten tions of the ministers. Although March 10 has been announced as the wedding day the prince of "Wales tonight authorized the statement that the cereniouv might take place earlier, probably February 10 the anniversary of the queen'- marriage. ' The current storiea that the betrothal Is due to the duke of Clarence's persistent love under great opposition do not agree with the court reports. On the contrary it is known that the duke ot Clarence has long been enamored of Princess Helene of Orl-ans, aud that two years ago he per sonally declared hi- passion tothecountof Paris and received the assurance thai Princess Ilelene reciprocated his love, aud that both her father nnd mother approved of the mutch. Priucess Helene then went to Rome to put the question of n clmngeof religion as an absolute necessitvbefore the pope, who told her th it it would be im possible that such a chauge could obtain uin remotest sympathy. The question re mained untitled until Priuce George be enme ill, w lien the queen und pr.nce and princess of Wales became alarmed overthe chanceof the duke of Fife neariuir the throne. Pressure was then put upon the duke of Clarence, which led to his accept ance of Priucess Victoria Mary, for whom ie nas auown a cousinly hkiug. On the occasion of the coming marriage the queen will raise the duke of Teck and his chil dren to the dignity of "royal highnesses." They are now simply "highnesses." THE CHILIANS. New York, Dec. 1L Under a nraiso date the "World prints this: Val- "The substance of President Harri son's statement of Chilian affairs was re ceived today and is a subject of ntiiversal comment. It is remarked by the Chilians as decidedly threatening a rupture, as it is believed that the Chilian government will not consent either to apology or offer any material indemnity. The majority iu congress is known to be opposed to any concessions and the Chilian government would find it difficult to carry the neces sary support for any humiliating meas ures. "It is now no secret that the government is proceeding actively with warlike prep aration, and that artillery of the latest manufacture has been ordered from Ger many. "The situation is complicated by Spain's demand for a large indemnity. Tho Chilians have always detested the Span ish. They would challenge Spain if they had not the United States to deal with. "Captain Schley declined to express any opinion for the public as to the president's message, but it was evident that ho was Dleased with it." 

FRANCE AND RUSSIA. PAKIS. Dec. 1L Senator Barthelmy Saint Hilare, ex-minister of foreignaffaiis, said to the Associated Press correspondent yesterday: "I am distinctly opposed to this attempt to draw France and Russia into an alliance. I can discover no com mon bond of union between tho most en lightened people of Europe and a country that is almost eastern in its barbarity. Tho prevalent idea in Franco is that this alliance will enable her to regain tho lost provinces, while she will help Russia to lay hands on Constantinople. But while Russia will not fail to seize every oppor tunity of consolidating and increasing her empire she would not embroil herself with Europe in order to please France; nnd whfri" satisfied, would repudiate any claims the latter power might have ou ber. Having made herself most formida ble by the aid of France, Russia would not hesitate even to attack France if sho thought she would advance her own inter ests by doing so. In my opinion, the most natural and profitable alliance for Franco would be one with England." BRAZILIAN FACTIONS. Rio Janeiro. Dec. 11. Disagreements have arisen between the government and Senor Portella, governor of the state of Rio Janeiro. The differences are so radi cal that the government has requested the governor to resiguTiis position. This request the govei nor has declined to ac cede to. It is now expected that the gov ernment will appoint a military governor of tho state and that martial law will bo proclaimed. There is much uneasiness in financial circles here growing out of tho panic which prevailed on the bourse yes terday. It is feared that in tho event of a repetition of tho panic today much trouble will bo caused for the banks, and, conse quently, guards have been detailed to pro tect them. FRENCH DUELISTS. PARIS, Dec. 11. During a debate In the chamber there today were several disord erly scenBe, culminating in a regular beer garden uproar M. Assou and the duke do Berrie violently abused M. Floquet, president of the chamber, affairs reaching a climax when M. de Cassagnac, enraged at the utterances of M. Floquet, sprang to his feet, and deliberately called the latter a liar. M. Floquet, as soon as he was able to do so, challenged M. de Cassagnac to with draw the term or meet him 'on the field of honor. M. de Cassaguac positively refus ed to retract.

THE RUSSIAN TROUBLES. London, Dec. 1L The Chronicle's St. Petersburg conespondent says: "Matters here are drifting from bad to worse. The whole energy of tho department of finance seems centered in manipulating funds on the .Berlin and Paris exchanges. Despite tho reports of gold imports, the Imperial bank return does not show an increase. There is nothing to show whether the gold is locked iu the war chest or what has be come of it. All classes are discouraged, because of tho half-hearteduess of the measures taken by the government to cope with tho famine difficulties." A FRISCO FIRE. SAN Francisco. Dec. 11.

Two shall he born th wholo wide world apart, And speak -hi different tongues, and have no thought Bach of the other's bcfnj, and no heed; Yet these o'er unknown seas to unknown lands Shall cross; escaping wreck, defying: death, And all unconsciously shape .every act And bend each wandering step nnto this end. That one day ourof darkness they shall meet. And read life's moaning in each other's eyes. And two shall walk some narrow way of life So closely side by side, that should ono turn Ever so little spa je to left or right. They needs must stand acknowledged face to face; Yet these with groping hands that never clasp With wistful eyes that never meet, and lips Calling in vain on ears that never hear. Shall wander all their weary days unknown And die unsatisfied. And this is Fate! New York Critic A CALICO BALL "Say, George, don't you want to take me to a calico ball next week?" said Jennie, in a voice fully as high pitched but somewhat less bitter than that with which she was accustomed to remark: "Ca-a-shl Seventy five! Come here, can't you!" several times in the course of the day. "Aw, what would I want to do that for?" retorted George, much as he might have told the boy to take that steak around to Mrs. Smith's, and be quick about it now. With these little preliminaries a con-, versation began, which resulted in a mu tual understanding, whereby George was to get the next Saturday night off from the boss of the butcher shop, and with Jennie was to go to the ball. The ticket said, "Grand march begins promptly at 8:30," and so George, who hadn't had much experience with balls, got around to Jennie's boarding house at 7:30 p. m. "You must think you're going toamat" was Jennie's salutation. "Aw, see here, this thing begins at 8:30," protested George, producing the ticket. "Oh, they always put that on the tickets; it don't mean nothin; there won't no ball beg?h in New York before 10 o'clock, and don't you forjget it." And it didn't, for when at 9:45 o'clock Gcorgeand Jennie got off the street car at the corner and hurried down the cross street in the direction of a faint blare of brass and string music the people were just beginning to stream into the doors to the hall. Jennie wore an old gossamer over her jacket and skirts, and George cast constant furtive glances down behind him, as if making sure that nothing was show-' ing beneath the tails of his overcoat. The reason was suggested when George, in tho little room at one side that served as a men's dressing room, removed the over coat and disclosed beneath it a remarkably gay and phenomenally long tailed dress coat of brilliantly figured calico. Mean time Jennie's gossamer and jacket had come off in another small room and re vealed her costume, which looked as though it might have been aSundpybest dress borrowed from the cook, but which really had been loaned to her by an accom modating friend at the same counter, who hadtgotjttOwear at- a calico ball on the eastside earlier in the season. It was a little slimpsy, not having been -starched sufficiently, 4ut Jennie's person being by no means an ill formed one, the gown might have been even more clinging than it was and not have made any unpleasing revelations. The gown was of pale green goods, with a small dark pattern, and while Jennie was waiting for George in the hall she went up to the hat check window, and re ceiving a plain white envelope slipped into it a small necktie which tho rules of the came reauired should bo of the same ma- terial as her dress. "When George, with . much trepidation and an evident disposi- tion to keep feeling of the unaccustomed tails of his giddy coat, came out from tho men's room Jennie gave a contented sigh and remarked vivaciously: "Oh, I'm so glad you've got a red on. If it'd been blue it'd have just killed my dres3." George, who had hired the coat for seventy-five cents from a costumer, gave the tails a twitch aud asked if it looked all right on hira. "Anything looks all right on a man," replied Jennie sharply, "but I'd never have forgiven you if you'd had a blue coat on." George and Jennie went up stairs with the rest and sat down awkwardly in two of the single row of chairs strung around the sides of the large dancing floor. George seemed bothered by his coattails and his feet. Jennie looked him over critically and remarked: "Say, brace up. You don't look any worse than tho rest of 'em." This was comforting, for George could see by looking about the room that calico dress coats didn't look so outlandish as they felt. The band was playing fitfully in the gal lery, aud a few couples were engaged in a spasmodic aud apparently unpremedi tated waltz, but the ball was not yet open, and the half down gas lent a general at mosphere of depression to the place. In fifteen or twenty minutes an important looking mnn with a regular dress suit, of which the coat and vest were elaborately faced with gay calico, came hustling up stairs and waved his hand toward tho gal lery. The band struck up a march. At the same instant the light was turned on full head, and Jennie's spirits going up with the gas, she poked George suddenly in the ribs, and exclaimed: "Say!" "What?" "Oh, nothin; ain't it pretty?" Jennie probably referred to the looks of the hall under the brilliant fights, and George replied that it was pretty. "With tho first bars of the music the im portant looking man had started out on a slow, impressive pace straight down one Eide of the hall. Others in calico coats fell in behind him, keepin? step. George got up after Jennie had nudged him seven or eight times and joined the procession. After all who wore calico coats were march ing, those who were in ordinary dress, in cluding three swallow tails, a few frocks, many cutaways and a tine assortment of sacks, fell in behind them, so that present ly there were a hundred or so men in line pacing solemnly and with shore steps down the hall. At the end the leader turned, took two 6teps, and then turned again to face back at the end from which he had started, and so, the line doubled on itself, the march proceeded. Meantime the girls and women had left their seats and were standing all about in good spots from which to inspect the pro cession, which kept doubling on itself up and down the hail,waikmg about four feet sideways ever' time It crossed the big room. Is was tedious progress, and the girls got to making audible comments on the men as they passed. One girl with strawberry blond hair, a pale pink dress and an upper gum that was exposed when sver she spoke or smised, nudged her com panion, a thin ltttfe thing In yellow, wuh a muddv complexion and a defect In her 1 right eye, and remarked as George passed: l "Say. Mary, look at that thing In a red f coat, ain't it a guy" ! Jennie was standm;; near, and overheard this. She turned, and sized the strawberry blond up with one look that reached from U" badly rubbed shoes to th. rfainesume . diadem in her hair. The blond seemed embarras-3. showed her npper gum in a deprecating fashion and mumbled: "Oh. excuse me; I didn't know he was i Your comnanv." " The muddy nirl in yellow giggled, bat J another look from head to heels, and then, turning away contemptuously, said aud ibly: "Macyrs!" The word was instinct with all the scorn that a girl who works in a store on Twen ty-third street can feel for one who stands behind a Fourteen th street counter,- Ths strawberry blond flushed and exposed both gums at once in a hitter smile. She seemed to meditate summary action, but was recalled to herself by a fresh giggle from her companion and a muttered in junction to behave herself. By this time the procession of men was making its last lap up the hall, and the head was passing a man in an elaborate calico coat, waistcoast and trousers, who held a large tray filled with envelopes. Each man took one, and when he had torn it open took out the necktie that it con tained, broke ranks and set out to find the girl with a dress to match. George opened his envelope as the rest did, and set off with a pale pink tie dan gling in his hand. He had peered into about two groups of girls, when Jennie seized him by the arm and exclaimed: "What are yon doing?" "Looking for my girl." "Say, George, do you want any other girl than me, or don't you?" The form of the question was a little confusing, and George didn't answer. "Put that thing up, quick," said Jennie. "What for?" "Oh, give it here," and with an impa tient grab Jennie took the pale pink thing, crushed it in her hand, and from some secret placain her gown pulled out a tie of pale green to match her dress. She stuck this through the button hole of George's calico coat, tied it into a neat bow, took George's arm with decision, and started off around the room with him. George didn't seem to half understand it and began to protest. "Say, do yon want to see what you'd 'a' got into if I hadn't grabbed you?" said Jennie. "What do you mean?" "Right down that aisle, second turn to the left, there by that door," said Jennie. Indicating the strawberry blond, who, left alone in waiting, was exhibiting her gums In an apprehensive smile, and eagerly awaiting the appearance of a knight with apalapink tie. The couples were falling i iQline for tne grand march, but Jennie manageu to Btroii witn ueorge around past that pale pink young woman and casually drop a necktie upon the floor be side her. George still couldn't quite get through his head how Jennie had worked it, and wanted to know what ahout the fellow that got the pale green tie to match her dress. "George, you make me tired," said Jen nie candidly. "You don't suppose I was going to have some awkward ninny danc ing with me all night because he got a tie like my dress, do you? If the fellow that gets my envelope don't like the tie ho finds In it, he can throw it away for all I care." George had never heard of that sort of a calico ball arrangement before; but as he gazed at the strawberry blond, who had just discovered the necktie and was stand ing upon it to conceal it until she could pick it up unnoticed, and quivering with rage he accepted the goods the gods had provided and said nothing. The column of , couples in th&ygrand march presently got around to another man with a tray, who dealt out a big en velope to each lady. These opened, each found a neat little calico apron, which, promptly put on, gave a piquant effect to the calico dresses, and so set off the charms of ono young woman who had broken the rules and come in a dress of plain black stuff that she promptly became the object, of sinister looks and side remarks from all the other women. It did almost as well by Jennio, with her dark hair and eyes and clear complexion. There were two cute little pockets in it, Bna" Jennie stood asido after trying It on, thrust her hands into them, jerked her head demurely on one side and looked at George, The stupid fellow seemed strug gling with an idea. "Say, Jennie, you look kind o', kind o"' "Words seemed to come slowly, and Jen nie, who wa3 waiting hungrily for the compliment, said in her tensest "Cash here!" tone: "Kind o' what?" George seemed stumped for the word, but after a moment the inspiration cama to him, and all at once he blurted out: "Kind o' homelikel Damned if you don'tl" It wasn't just the word Jennie, who had lived in a cheap boarding house for five years since her mother died, bad expected, and it affected her queerly. She swallowed a lump and her eyes got dewy. "Oh, rubbish!" she said, with a funny quaver in her voice, but not as if dis pleased, and, grabbing George's arm, set off with him in a rapid walk to a place where a set was forming for a quadrille. George said nothing for some time, and Beemed oppressed with a heavy thought. It was 3 o'clock when the ball broke up. Jennie and George walked home, thestreet car was such a long time coming. Jennie was tired, and it was no wonder she leaned heavily on George's arm. She had to slip off her gossamer in the vestibule in her wrestle with her pocket In search of the key. When she had found it she slipped it in the lock, and facing about in the dim light stuck her hands again in the apron pockets and looked saucy. George seemed to have an idea again, but if there was any inspiration connected with it it came too late, for in a moment afterward Jennie's hand had stolen back to the key, the door was opened, and with a good night that forcibly recalled "Cash here!" when "cash" hasn't been here after the first two calls, she went inside and the ball was over. George walked home with an uneasy feeling, as if he had lost something with out just knowing what it was, and Jennie, up in her room, stood before the glass for a moment with her hands in those apron pockets again, laughed a little laugh and gurgled: "I wonder what he'd say If I'd pop!"
