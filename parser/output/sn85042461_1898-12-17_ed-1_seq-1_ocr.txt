THE SENATORIAL CONTEST Has Resolved Itself Into a Guess' ing Contest EVEN THE EXPERTS ARE ALL AT SEA Just Now Burns is a Good First Choice, Grant Second and Bulla Third With Probability of Rearrange ment or Reversal Tomorrow Special to The Herald. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10 —The sena torial situation has resolved itself into a general guessing contest, to far as in Forma tion goes, not only of the average citizen liut of many men who are presumably on the inside of the mystic pool of polities. In the four weeks that intervenes between now and the lirst Tuesday after legislative or ganization, when the election of a United States senator is in order, hot times among the workers are looked for. ' I asked a man today—one of the best in formed newspaper men in the city - for his inside tip, and he promptly confessed him self at sea. "Nobody really knows," he said; "no one can give a good guess or make a safe bet. The Herrin muddle and the withdrawal of De Young, the open opposi tion of De Young and Spreekels to Hums, the half-hearted support of Grant in the south. Knight's strength in Humboldt nnd northern counties)—-all these have com bined to make as line a senatorial mix-up ar tin' state has ever had. M> best judg ment, now, is that it looks like Hums lirst, Grant second and Bulla third." lt is generally conceded that Grant will have thirty votes in caucus while he will need forty. Bums, according! to outlook, will have tbe San Francisco, Alameda and Sacramento contingents sure. Knight's: votes will likely go to Burns, although the silver-tongued lawyer says he is in the field to stay. Barnes, like De Young, is far in the Held, and :. -« of the wiseacres give any credence to the boasts of the friends of Dr. Pardee of Alameda. It was tbe gossip of the lobbies today that Herrin, the astute, is displaying a letter from ('.'P. Huntington, in which the aged manipulator exprevs»?sconfidence in Herrin, and says his course in pontic* has his "un qualified approval." This letter, the story goes, was displayed over the lunch table with Considerable pride. But the date of the -'• letter—that was something the friend f a J]f^_ WAR AND STARVATION MAKE CHIN CHOW CHINAMEN TIRED OF LIFE Thousands of People Dying and Other Thousands Terrorized by Anti- Foreign Rebels SAN FRANCISCO, Doe. 10.—On board the steamer Gaelic, which arrived from the Orient today, was Rev. 11. W. White, a missionary, lie brings news of a terrible condition of affairs existing in the Chin Chow Fu province, a section 150 miles long and seventy miles wide, inhabited by over 4,500,1100 people, mostly farmers. Owing to two successive droughts the eiops hate been failures and the people of the province mentioned arc dying by thousands from starvation and the outlying provinces and the government arc doing little to help the suffering. The people of Bhang-Tung prov ince are also starving. In some of the vil lages of the latter place there are hundreds of deaths in a week's time. In thin Chow Fu there have been a.s many as 180 deaths in one day. Rebellion Rampant TACOMA, Wash, Dec. 16.—The steamer Empress of India brings news from ( hung King, China, via, Shanghai, that business is still paralyzed throughout the western Chinese province of Szehuen, because of the depredations of Yumantze and his band of 5000 rebels, who are thoroughly disciplined and wear a uniform having for its distin guishing feature the Chinese character mean ing "revenge." They arc determined to rid China of all foreigners and to stamp out the Christian religion. There are 0000 Catholic refugees in Cluing King, and the property destroyed by the rebels is estimated at 5,000,000 tacls. During their raids they have rendered 20,000 people, mostly native Christians, homeless, and sixty-two lives have been taken, including several European mission aries. Yumantze recently beheaded two Catho lic missionaries, which the city of Yuinchuan gave up to bim as hostages. He offered them their lives if they would renounce their religion. They refused. J. Fleming, an English missionary, has been killed by natives and soldiers at Tsing ling, ninety miles east of Kuei Yang. The. mission house was raided and burned down. There has been no attempt to punish the rebels at the hands of tbe mandarins. France demands 5,000,000 tacls damages for the destruction of tbe French mission ary property. A French missionary was burned to death at Swatow. The mission was attacked and Catholic crosses nnd nltars destroyed by a mob of 1000 of the Christian haters. Advices by the Empress of India state that Russia has sold half a million obsolete Berdan rifles to China nt a large price through tlie Russo-Chinese Bank. Viceroy Tnn of Canton is ordered from Peking to pay for them at the rate of five taels per rifle and 12 taelH per 1000 cartridges-. Every two rifles are supplied with a set of extra parts ill case of loss. Manchu troops throughout the empire arc to be armed at once with these rifles. Transports Selected NEW YORK. Dec. 16.-The transporta tion department of the army was notified to to Me, and tlie assumption of those who love not Herrin is that the letter is of antique date—prior, at leavt, to that famous conference at which Herrin told De Young and Spfcekels that the railroad favored Hums. The (.'all today prints this story about Grant! "It may be of interest to the legislators who will Hoon be called upon to choose a United States senator to know a few of the schemes this brilliant young man so re cently arrived from beyond the mountains has attempted to put into execut ion in order to delude the general public and secure for himself w hat he is pleased to call hisi'ambi tion.' Some time ago Mr. Grant approached a gentleman who is prominent in the councils of the Republican party and sought his support. This is the proposition he made: " 'I have an ambition to be United States senator. If you will lend your influence and support to secure, my election i will serve one year in congress and then resign in your favor.' "The gentleman to whom the offer was made replied that he was not in the busi ness of assisting unknown young men to gratify personal ambition at the expense of the people of the state. He also said much more tot the same effect and. Mr. ("rant was dismissed with the assurance that be would do well to let 'crooked' polities atone if be wished to retain the respect of decent men. If Mr. Grant has a sufficient disregard for Ihe truth to deny the assertion that he made the above-mentioned proposition the name ol the gentleman will be given, as well as some additional particulars regarding the interview." The name of thii. gentleman "prominent in tbe councils of the Republican party" is understood to be none other than the Call's proprietor, .lohn D. Spreekels. Green, Grant's manager, declined tonight to dis cuss >pc matter, nor srttktjte Spreekels men say more. They await Grant'sjdenial. day by the war department to get ready two transports to leave here as soon lis possible for Manila via the Sues canal. The i transports Mobile and Mohawk have been! selected and t'olonel Kimball lias been in- : structed to have them brought here audi made ready for service as soon as possible. | Ebch of the transports has a capacity of 2400 men, but for this trip they will carry only 1800 men each. _ .

"The government," he said, "should be judged not on individual items, but on the success of a poliev as a whole." Referring to the "difficulty of taking the people into a government's' confidence in matters of foreign policy," he said:' "I have often felt the'want of such an in stitution as the United States foreign rela tions committee. It is impossible here, but it must be a great advantage for a min ister to be able to meet persons not of his own political opinion and to explain to them the reasons for his action."

THE HERALD SUNKEN SHIPS OF WAR MAY YET BE RAISED AND SEE SERVICE MANY ENGINEERS ARE EAGER To Make Contracts to Raise the Maine and the Colon on Contingent Fees Associated Press Special Wirei NEW YORK, Dec. 16.—A dispatch to the Tribune from Washington says: The Navy Department has not abandoned the hope of rescuing the Maine from Havana harbor and bringing the wreck back to this country for rehabilitation, nor does it seem i likely, from the interest taken by respon j sible wrecking experts', that the Cristobal j Colon will be permitted to pound to pieces jon the shore west of Santiago. The board |of construction has under consideration a 'formal proposition for the salvage of both I these vessels and their delivery at New York or such other port in the United .State* as the government might select, but no company will be allowed to begin opera tions on the vessel until a comparison car. be made between the offers from several trustworthy concerns. The Swedish company, which is said to he the most capable and experienced in the world, now has experts at work on the Colon, making an investigation into the difficulties involved in her salvage. Divers and engineers have been brought from Ku rope, especially for this' purpose, and after satisfying themselves of the Colon's condi tion and the expense that must he incurrer in floating her they will go to Havana ant examine the Maine. There is no doubt in the minds of naval oftieials that the re oprt of these experts will result in a bona ride otter from the Swedish company. The Navy Department has, however, made the rigid rule that no proposition will be con sidered involving the government in any ex pensc until the vessels are safely deliverer in a naval dry dock, on the "no cure, no pay" principle. One offer under consideration comes from some associated engineers in New York City who have ample capital and who easily con vinced the board of the feasibility of their project from an engineering point of view. Their original terms, which are, however, subject to modification, contemplated the payment by the government of $2.50,000ca5h in the case of the Maine, and $1,000,000 in the ease of the Colon on their delivery a the New York or the Norfolk Navy Yard in addition to one-third of the appraisei value of these vessels on their arrival, the valuation to be made by a board of arbi tration. The uncertainty as to the precise amount of remuneration involved in thi proposition is not attractive to the nava officials, who will insist on stipulating the exact sum to be paid by the government for salvage before a contract is signed. The method of raising the vessels to be used by the engineers who appeared before the board is extremely simple. Pneumatic caissons attached to chains, passed under neath the vessels through channels by al ternating jets of water and compressed air constitute the lifting power. These chan nels will be of sufficient size to enable a diver to pass under the vessel with mes senger lines. As soon as the chains are hauled through and made fast to the sides or deck of the vessel, the excavations wil be rilled up by the process by which they were made to prevent the vessel from set tlia*. Experience has shown that ten o twelve such channels' will not cause a heavily loaded vessel to sink more than six inches in very soft material. To effect the release of a vessel situatec like the Maine, in tenacious harbor dtpos its, iets of compressed air will be sent afoni the Keel simultaneously with the introduc tion of air into the caissons. The caisson are uniform in size, having a buoying or lift ing effort of thirty tons 1 each, this constitut ing the system, the weight of the vessel ant its contents determining the number re quired to raise it. Their size and weigh admit of these caissons being easily handlec in the water by the divers alone and thei distribution, together with the automatic valves with which they are provided, make it possible to exert a uniform force on al parts of the vessel. The danger of rupture from undue pressure due to depth under water or other causes or the danger o breaking air hose is wholly obviated by the automatic valves. The caissons are ar ranged in series, and greater or less power as circumstances require, may be exertet at any point. The system is declared to af ford complete control of the wreck and when the water is expelled from the cais sons the vessel is lifted to the> surface in , single operation. It is asserted that witl these caissons the Cristobal Colon can b raised and righted even in a sea way. In the case of the Maine, it is intendet to cut away the forward portion of the hull LOS ANGELES, SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 17, 1898 WASHINGTON, Dec 10.—William .1. Bryan came to tbe House of Representa tives about 1 o'clock today and was given a most cordial reception by his former col leagues in Congress. Earlier in the day Representative Bailey of Texas, the Demo cratic floor leader, breakfasted with Mr. Bryan at tbe latter's room, and it is undcr >tood discussed in a general way questions of public and party policy. When Mr. Bry an reached the House he was escorted to the Democratic cloakroom, where he was surrounded by members nnd made tile re cipient of many attentions. For some time he talked socially and politically with that unreserve which marks cloakroom discus sion. BRYAN AT THE CAPITAL Colonel Bryan expressed himself very em phatically to his Democratic associates upon the duty of congress in regard to tbe Philippines. He believes that the inlands ought not to be held longer than is neces sary for the I'nited States to establish there a stable and independent government, as was guaranteed to Cuba in the resolution" which led to the declaration of war, and he believes it is the duty of congress to make a declaration of the intention of the I'nited States at the earlist possible date, in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future and that the natives of the islands j may be assured that the ultimate purpose |of the United States is to give them a free j and independent government. The war j was fought for humanity's sake, he says, j and the I'nited States, in tbe hour of vie ■ tory should stand upon the policy it had pro- I claimed at thqebuteet regarding Cuba.

Bryan by Friends at Washington BARSTOW BULLETS Fired by a Mexican Who Prudently Retires BARSTOW, Cal, Dec. 16.—A shooting scrape occurred in the Harvey House lunch counter, about 3 o'clock this morning, in which Harry Wettoeh, lunchinan, was shot in the arm by a drunken half-breed named Carlos Lozano. The trouble arose over a dispute in mak ing change. Lozano drew two large revol vers and was threatening to shoot, when George Hamilton, night yardmaster, hand ed Wettoeh a revolver. The two men ex changed four or five shots without effect, when Lozano ran outside and fired through the window, striking Wettoeh in the left arm above the elbow. Dr. Henshaw dressed the wound, but being unable to locate the bullet. Wettoeh was sent to San Bernardino on the passen ger train early this morning for treatment Lozano bears a bad reputation, having been in several shooting scrapes before. A posse is searching for him with threats of lynching if apprehended. A CABLE SYSTEM To Connect All the British Cable Stations LONDON, Dec. 16.—The morning papers print a letter addressed to the Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, secretary of state for the colonies, by Sir Sanfnrd Elcming, chan cellor of Queens university, Canada, and a leading expert in telegraph communication and tbe unification of time reckoning throughout the world, advocating the adop tion of a system of state-owned cables con necting every British possession and all of Great Britain's naval coaling stations. Sir Snnford Fleming proposes three sec tions of cables in the Pacific, Indian and At lantic oceans, and estimates their cost at £6,000,000. The first step he suggests is a state-owned Pacific cable. He contends that if his proposals were carried out the cost of cabling would be enormously cheap ened. The Ocean Vote TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 16.—The State can vassing Board decided a tie between A F Scott, Republican, and L. M. Marks, Popu list, candidates for the Legislature from Jefferson county, by ordering the drawing of lots. Mr. Scott won, but did not demand his certificate, going home with the expecta tion that it would be sent by mail. Before the certificate was sent, however, tbe mid- Pacific vote cast by the Twentieth Kansas, en route to Manila, was received. Upon ex amination one vote was found for Mr. Marks. Accordingly the State Canvassing Board reversed its decision and issued a certificate to Mr. Marks. DEWEY INTERVIEWED ON CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT MANILA THE ADMIRAL NOT TALKATIVE But He Makes a Number of Sensible Suggestions of the Methods to Be Followed Associated Press Special Wire MANILA, Philippine Islands, Dec. 16.— Hear Admiral Dewey, when a correspon dent of the Associated Press called upon him today, courteously, pleasantly but ab solutely declined to discuss the present sit uation in the Philippine Islands, on the ground that his sphere was purely naval. The Admiral seldom goes ashore, and in sisted that his interviewer was in better position to acquire information than him self. He then proceeded to cross-examine the correspondent about everything ashore. He was glad to learn the insurgents were feleasing the sick Spanish soldiers they held s prisoners, notwithstanding Agumaldo s grandiloquent refusal to do so. This proves that the insurgents arc very conciliatory, in spite of their defiant talk. ' • ■ Admiral Dewey always believed that the insurgents were friendly, and especially since the warships of our fleet have visited the different ports of those islands, and since some of our officers have made tours of the island, carefully investigating popu lar sentiment and judiciously preaching the gospel of peaceful settlement everywhere with highly satisfactory results. A few in fluential Filipinos, in an ambitious attempt at self-advancement, are clamoring for in -1 dependence, though unable to realize its true meaning. They are utterly ignorant of the difference between the name and > I the reality. j The agitators here invariably admit that they would he unable to stand without j American protection. But in spite of this, j they continue their meaningless outcry for I independence and may possibly create trouble. The Admiral, however, believes this to be improbable at the present junc ture, though every trilling incident counts. However, every day that passes without a conflict means so much gain, because the friendly feeling is steadily increasing, the incipient roughness is disappearing and the •agitators are weakening. The newspapers of Manila are doing par publication of conciliatory articles printed in 'publication of ooncilitory articles printed in Spanish and in English. This course is i looked upon as being certain to eliminate the friction which has existed here. The Admiral is greatly interested in the ' movement among the American volunteers jto obtain their discharges here and engage 'in pioneering enterprises. He believes there is a practically unlimited ticld for planters, i farmers anil miners here. To the sugges- I tion that if the natives prove to be obstrep | erous perhaps they might be handed over |to the Germans or other ungentle land ! grabbers, the Admiral said hie believed the | Germane now have entirely abandoned their design in the Philippine Islands, though, I formerly, he said, the German altitude here bad caused him indescribable anxiety. According to recent information received here, the Filipino insurgents are endeavoring | to maintain a brave show for the purpose of securing the best terms possible from the Americans, lt is the opinion of our Ad miral that it would be advisable for the I'nited States to pay insurgent troops their arrears of wages. The whole amount would be a comparatively trifling sum, and the payment of the troops would have a valu able effect and may save incalculable trouble-. Admiral Dewey was strongly convinced that the. Filipino insurgents deserve ackowl edgment. lie is a believer in the practi cability of liberal measures in the direction of local autonomy. Regarding the possibility of international complications Admiral Dewey said: "Prior to the arrival of the monitors 1 felt uneasy, but now I am ready to hold this position against the whole earth."

He said he never heard a complaint of the condition of the commissary supplies at the front. So far at the food was concerned General Weston characterized the Santiago cam paign as a mere bagatelle, the hardships being trivial, compared to his own experience iv frontier Indian campaigns, when he and his men were forced to use the Wagon mules for food. The Rev. Dr. Henry C. McCook of Phila delphia, chaplain of the Second Pennsyl vania and commissioner of the National Re lief association, said that on his return from Cuba he had called on President McKinley, August 6th, and added: '•If there was anything I did know and he did not get it out of me I am. unaware of it. He has wonderful powers' of cross examination." The president at that time commissioned him to find and permanently mark the graves of the soldiers and he. did so. Quartermaster General Ludington testi fied as to the operations of his department prior to and during the war. The chief difficulty in preparing the army equipment, he said, was in securing the dueff and kersey for tents, both of which were manufactured especially for the army.
