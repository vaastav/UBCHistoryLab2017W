Harvard won the annual dobate from Princeton In Banders Theatre this evening on tho question, "ltesolved, That the claims of England In ftie controversr with tho Houth African Ilepubllo were justifiable." Frlnce ton hosed her argument against England on the ground that no suzernlntr existed be tween the Ilepubllo and England owing to the abandonment of the claim by the latter In the oonventlou of 1881. Princeton also tried tn maintain that the Doors were Justlflod In maintaining their stand on account of the attitude of tho Outlandrrs nnd that the present disturbance, aroso from tho disorderly stale of tho eotihtry. Harvard based her contention on tho law of nations which ghos any country the right to protect her citizens wherever thoy are bolng wronged nnd succeeded In showing that such was the case lu South Africa. llruce, the Harvard colored speaker, was the star of the evening, his spcoh being the finest effort heard on a Harvard platform In many rears.

Tho mooting of tho National Civil Service lleform League canio very near broaklng un In a row to-dav when the bodT mot In BOcrot session to hear the re port of the Commutes on Resolutions. In vlow rf tho bitterness which somo ot speakers had shown toward the President and his advisers regsrdlng the order withdrawing placos from the classified sorvlce. It was ox pected that the committee would follow u simi lar bent nnd report soma stinging resolutions. This proved to bo the esse and loud and strenuous opposition was expressed to the re port. Jt was argued that, while It might be true that tho President had acted ns chareod. It was also truo that such strong Inngnago as the resolutions contalnod would show too muoh feeling on the part of the league and thus give It a partisan oharaoter, and that it would be best to moderate the expressions. Others opposed this view and deolnrud that there was no language too strong In wh'ch to tell thu truth, and that tin resolutions should stand as reported. The debato Increased In heat und a compromise was reached by ordutlng the committee to retire and re draft csrtatu tarts ot Its report, which was done, The resolutions, ns adopted finally, refer to the withdrawing ot several thousands of plncss from the classified ser vies as tho first backward step taken by a . Federal administration since the Civil Hervlce law wns adopted, and that the Injurious effects i have already become apparent in widespread I distrust of the President and the party In power 1 In encouraging the enemies ot reform to I attempt still further to cripple tho service, and , In ths demoralization ot many parts of the ' puhlla service. The re so utlons further deplore the foot that the Census Bureau has not been put under oivll service rules, as the party in power promised, and express the belief that this mat will leHtl to extravagance nnd Inefficiency, ns lu the last cenxus. In the diminished value ot the census so tukon. nnd In the lack of publla I confidence In Its aocuracy and Impartiality. In respet to the abuses nt the Indian service the resolutions nro as follows: "The Inefficiency nnd tho reeurrenco of scandals In the Indian service can bt removed only by withdrawing the office of Indlmi agent from the inhere ot Congro"lonnl patrouuge. The President has full power to dovlne for his own guidance a suitable system of competitive examinations nnd promotions tor such plaoes. Tho clerical force ot the Indian service Itself would supply many excellent men for the higher post of Indian Agent, and from the ranks ot Agents the Iuepectorshlps might often be filled. It cannot he too often repeated that the spoils syidem has proved the buno of the Indian service."

Britain has been predominant on ths seas for so long that It Is n common notion that llrltlsh sailors are about as good sailors as there are. That Is not the opinion ot sailor men hold br all captains In the Ilrltlth mer chant marine, br any means. And tho captains are not afraid tnsar so even when a look over their crews does not dltclose that a percent age, sometimes high, of tho crow Is of foreign nationality. A captain of one of tho Atlantlo liners In this port the other day was bewailing the fact that his crew were Britishers. Ha wasn't a bit particular about tho kind of Brit ishers he called them, no moro so than the typical old skipper of the sen story books In the times of the wind-jammers.

Among many of the captains of freighters this feeling Is expressed fre..y and so glad nre the captains to get n crew not English that It Is no unusual thing to and crews no two members of which under the boatswain are of the same nationality. This Is not because the captain has had to take such men as he could get, but heeau-ohe took theso by proference. One llrlUsh ship that visits this port left hero recently with a crew com prised of a Wolshmsn. a German, sn Austrian, a )lalagaacar negro, a Greek and a Hungarian. The Captain said that he would always take such, men rather than KnglUh sailors If he could get them, although he Is an Englishman. The captains do not always specify the reasons for their preference for foreigners. Bometlmes they say they nro better workmen. 1'erhaps they are not much less Independent. A young and bright Brooklyn matron has re cently devoted hours In developing the poss. bllltlos of a church fair. The fair lasted several nights and the enercetlo young matron sold a great number of articles to her personal friends, most of them from New York. These artlolce Were to be delivered br the energotlo one. Yeeterdnr morning she decided that It was time to hand over to her patrons the beautiful gewgaws which were to be delivered. There waa a profit on these articles of $0.82. They were very bulky. They were to t de lUered in Now York. The vntranolng young llrookiin matron thought that thoy could be delivered by a messenger boy, but when the bulk of tho articles was considered It was plain that that was out ot tho nuestlon. Ho the young matron hired n coupt!. for which site paid 10 to deliver the goods on which a profit ot $tl.t2 had ben made, but all this was In the Interest of charity and kindness and tine feei ng, and The Hun supposes that It's all right. John IL Breslln ot the Gllsey House said last week that he was going to move uptown In Mar to overtake some of his old patrons who had left him because his hotel was not tar enough from the Batterr. It was not many years ago that the Ollsey House was too far up town for busy mon who came to New Y'ork Mr. Ilreslln Is undoubtedly justlflod In his be Hot that ho Is now well south ot the fashionable hotel district. "I should say." said n hotel man. "that Fiftr-nlnth street comes prettr near being the centre of the fashionable hotel dis trict, but I wouldn't venture to guess how long It will star there. I'eople In this town take our magnificent new hotels as a matter of course and thus don't realize that ther represent a muchgiester development thau our theatres or our public buildings. Hotels that were ths finest In the cltv ten years ago are now very much outclassed so far as the appointments nre concerned hy the hote's that have been erected since that time. Curiously enough tho greater the number of new hotels the greater Is the demand for accommodations In them. When tho first of the new hotels was pro jected, a fw years ago. many wise men said that New York had all the hotels that It could supisut then. A dozen more followed this first one. each bigger than Its predecessor or at any rate more expensively appointed, and apparently they have all thrived. One expla nation of this growth of hotels that has boon ptorlnokert Is to be found In tho growth of arge country places around Now York. Tho Increased Interest In country llfo holds tho owners of these pluces uway from tho city until winter has begun In earnest. Their stay In New ork Probably Is tint longer than three or four months and tho big new hotels furnish them just as luxurious and exclusive accom modations ns they could find in a city house, Many of them have consequently become citizens of the country places where thoy live, and when they oome to the city they go to hotels. It would probably surprise you to see the long list of wealthy New Yorkers who now spend their winters In hotels, and who. a few years ago. maintained olty hnuites. We have the finest hotels In the world In this city nnd visitors from abroad comment on that fact." The experience at the last Hundar concert showed that th encore nulssnoecan readily bo suppressed through the exo else of a little firmness. Mr. Damrosch. who was conducting, very wisely refused to allow any of the artists during tho earlier part of the evening to sing more than the numbers sot down for them. 1 heie was the customary amount of noisy applause and seemingly It was not going to end until the artist hiid appeared and sung or Played once again.

The A'urro J'ali tart In regard to the message ot Tresldent McKinley to Congress that It Is perfectly In harmony with other Presidential utterances regarding Cuba, and that they all go directly to prove that the Intention of the United Btates Is clearly to annex the Island. The only differ ence is that this message has been diluted with high-sounding phrases which appeal to Im pressionable people. In regard to the meaning of the word "Independent" the paper sas that President McKinley In his message called the present postal' system In Cuba "essentially In dependent" "Free Cuba" with l'resldont McKinley has a far different meaning from the same oxpresslon among the Cubans. The at tainment of the freedom and stability men tioned by Mr. McKinley does not depend so much on the form of government ns nn the fact that there are really capable oltlzent to admin ister and to abide by the laws. This Is ret to be proved. The A'wto bit believes that Gen. Wood Is the best man Cuba could have for Governor General, because he represents the President, not onlr politically but personally as well. It thinks that Gen. Wood favors Independence after a period of probation, believing that after a year of self-government the Island will pe tition forannoxatlou. Great preparations are being made to wel come Gen. Wood on his arrhul here. The veterans' societies and other organizations are particularly prominent In these preparations.
