We do not think such a dispo sition of the fund would I prudent or bene ficial unless the management at Chapel Hill is materially changed. At present, scores of our "oung men are going to Colleges outside the iimitsof this State Chapel Ilill does not sustain the reputation it formerly did and the addition of an Agricultural Department will not much help its standing.

Let Chap el Hill take its chance among other institu tions, and let the institution be conducted ' in a more energetic and economical manner. It might be better, for the present, to leave the fuud in the hands of the State authori ties, unappropriated." m Mr. Wentworth offered a resolution in the House of Representatives 'of the United States, a day or two since, to the effect that the many recent acts of disloyalty in the Rebel States are additional reasons why they should pass the Constitutional Amendment before Congress can consider the propriety of admitting them. It was passed by 119 to 32. One of these recent acts of disloyalty in North-Carolina was the election of Judge Manly to the Senate. Another, was the dec laration by Gov. Worth in his message that Congress is an unconstitutional body. . m , THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. Important measures agreed upon Mr. Raymond s relations Kith the Republican party h is allowed to return tg tote of 38 to 36. .. . Wasulsgtox, Dec 5. Tbe Republican caucus to-night was attended by Dearly every member of the House and Senate. It remained in session for about two uours,.he proceedings being of a high ly interesting character. Several members took Mi. Rajiuontl to task for his temporary desertion from the party, and quite a lively discussion on the mutter was indulged in. Tbe tirst business in order was the report of the Committee of Nine appointed at the last caucus to determine upon a course ot proceedings foi Congress during its present session. The Committee recommended, tirst, the appointment of a special committee of three to go to New Orleans to investigate the facts connected with tbe riot of last Summer. This was unanimously adopted with great ap plausc Next came a recommendation fora com mittee of three to investigate the circumstances attending t lie murder of three citizens of Maine, serving in the United States army in South Caro lina. A lull history of this murder and all the parties and circumstances connected with it ap peared in the -'Tribune" of List Monday, This etep is Intended particularly by tbe members of tbe caucus to ferret out the abuses of the pardon ing power as exercised by the President, and to ascertain the connection of a certain Cabinet of ficer in procuring tbe release of the murderers, through bis influence at the White House, it hav ing been stated publicly -that he. received 10,000 tor bis services in that matter. It was next re " ' commended that the Committee on Military Af fairs inquire into the truth of tbe allegations that men who were on the pension roll tit the army and navy in I860, and who went into the Rebel army and fought through the war, have been re instated by order of the President or of his agents or subordinates on the pension rolls of the United State since the close ot the rebellion, iuis was ereeted with preat applause. It wag recommen- - tied and agreed to pass a bill excluding from tbe JileCXOrai OOliege 1U low m ouiicb u iiujc not represented in Congress. The enthusiasm with which this resolution was received was in tense, the approval of the members beiug shown bv arDlause which lasted several minutes. The next recommendation was for a committee of three to investigate what troth there was in the report that the President had restored lands for feited by acts ot Congress, and lastly, it was agreed to pass a bill tnat no names should be placed on the rolls of the Fortieth Congress from States not represented in the preceding Congress or declared entitled to representation ; and pro viding that no electoral votes shall be counted from any State not represented at the time in Congress. This was received with tremendous applause. This in reality ended the business of tbe caucus. - Mr. Ashley then rose in his scat and said he saw among those present a gentleman who had figured conspicuously in the Philadelphia Convention. This referred to Mr. Raymond. Mr Raymond then got up in a nervous manner and demanded an explanation. He said he was now a Union man. Applause, mingled with laughter. He had always been a Union man. Laughter. And desired to continue in the Union party, and he would remain in tbe Union party, God being bis helper. Renewed laughter. Mr. Schotlcld of Pa., moved that the question of Mr. Raymond's belonging to the Union party tie left for him to determine. If he honestly believed himself to be a member of that party he conid remain ; if not, he eould withdraw. Thad. Stevens then aroseand said he could not consent to let Johnson men into a Republican caucus.- The idea of Johnson Republicans was exploded long ago. As for him self, he hud never believed in such a thing, and he believed it now less than ever. Applause. J " But," said he, " if I had good, reliable evidence of tbe heartfelt repentance of Mr. Raymond, I would take him in on probation." Mr. Darling ot New York came to the relief of his colleague, and testified that Mr Raymond had supported Mr. Feuton for Governor. He thought they had better retain him in the party. Mr. Morris of New York, after adverting in severe terms to Mr. Raymond, said he was still willing to take him in, if be was sure of his repentance. Mr. Hale of N. Y., said he was in the same boat with Raymond, and had a fellow-feeling for him, and he hoped tliey would not be too hard on bim. Mr. Cook of Illinois said tbe National Executive Committee bad declared Raymond's place vacant; and bad pnt a new man in it He did not see how Ray mond could be retained in .the 'party. Mr. Ray mond again took the floor, and with mingled re trantauee and anger, said tbe caucus could do as It pleased but it could not drive him. " I went into the Philadelphia movement, it is true; when I fonnd out my mistake 1 quit" The previous question was called on Mr. Scbofield's motion, and sustained. Mr. Raymond rose to another ex-' planation. Mr. Stevens interrupted bim to ask it he still adhered to that Philadelphia address. Mr. Raymond " I do, according to my-inter-pretation of 1LV t ... Mr. Stevens " Do you, according to tbe usual Interpretation of language, adhere to it" ' Mr. Raymond "I do.'' Cries of "Pnt him out" ' ' A vote was then taken, and Mr. Sqhofleld's mo tion was carried by a small majority. Mr. Schenck . offered a resolution that no gentleman can honor ably retain his position in the Union party who still adheres to the address put forth at Philadel phia. This gave rise to a good deal of excitement, and i copy of tbe address was called for, bnt could not be obtained. Mr. Bingham moved to lay Schenck's resolution on the table. Tbe yeas and nays were demanded, and Schenck's resolution was laid on the table by a vote of 38 yeas to 86 . nays. The caucus then adjourned. , Dead Bodt Pound. On Monday evening last, Augustus Fogle, Coroner of this county, was notified that a dead body had been found on Mr. Joseph Scales' plantation on the Yadkin River, when he immediately proceeded to the place and examined the case according to law. J t proved to be the body of a colored person, so much decom ' posed as to render it necessary to bury it on the spot. The verdict of the jury is, the per son " came to his death by drowning, to the best of their knowledge, some twelve months since." The body was washed ashore during' a late ireshet. Salem free. Annual Report ot the Postmaster-Gen- - .-' ', v '.I... : . eral. "' The annual report of Hon. Alexander W. Randall shows a satisfactory condition of af fairs in the postal department. The revenues of this department for the year ending June 80th, 1866, were $14,886,986, 21, and the ex penditures $15,352,079.30, showing an excess of the latter of $965,093.09. ; The decrease of revenue compared with the previous year was 1 1-5 per cent., and the increase of ex penditures 12 per cent Including the stan- . ding appropriation for free mail matter, ($700,000,) the actual deficiency for the past year is only $265,093.09. , . .. . . : 

ESTIMATE FOB 1866. The estimated expenditures for the year ending June 30th, 1868, are $16,583,000 ; the revenues estimated at $15,106,835, and ap propriation for free matter $700,000 total, $15,806,225 ; excess of expenditures, $1,776, 6G5. For this deficiency no special appro-' priation will be required. There will be required, however, $1,550, 000 for- mail transportation between Atchi son and Folsom, New York and California, San Francisco, Japan and China, and be tween the United States and Brazil f POSTAGE STAMPS AND STAMPED ENVELOPES. Postasre and stamped envelopes produced in all, $11,988,608.25 a decrease of $858, 769.25 as compared with the previous year. . The aggregate, of stamped envelopes and stamped wrappers issued during the year ended June 30, I860, was $39,094,725 an increase of nearly 50 per cent. The increas ed demand since 1st of July for envelopes with printed cards and requests for return ing direct to the sender, if not promptly de livered to the address, is very notable, being about 66 per cent " The general use of such envelopes will tend largely to reduce the number of dead letters. During the year fifty-seven claims, amounting to $3,852.04, on account of robberies by armed forces, have been allowed, and nine, amounting to $374. 02, have been rejected. MAIL SERVICE IN OPERATION. Of mail routes in operation, there were 6,930 ; aggregate length, 180,021 miles ; ag gregate annual transportation, 71,837,914 miles ; aggregate annual cost, $8,410,184. The length of routes was increased over the preceding year 38,581 miles ; the annual "transportation, 13,724,420 miles ; and the cost, $l,d9d,590 the increase ansing princi pally from the restoration of service in the Southern States. The auinunt due for ser vice in the late surgent States for the year ending June 36, 1856, was $769,218 ; the net postal receipts for the same period, $693, 835 ; liabilities exceeding receipts by $75, 883. - The whole service now in operation in these States of all grades number 1.523 routes, with an aggregate length of 60,170 miles, at a cost of $1,845,623 54 per annum. The numlier of Southern railroad routes not in operation September 30, 18(36, was fourteen ; aggregate length, 696 12-100 miles. All the routes in these States wre duly ad vertised to be let to contract but on a large number no proposals were received, and on many others the bids were extravagantly high. The overland mail route to California has now two points of departure one from Junc tion City, Kansas, and the other from Fort Kearney, Nebraska, The lines from these points meet at Denver City, .Colorado Terri tory. The Junction City road connects at Wyandotte with the Pacific railway from St Louis, Mo., making a continuous railway connection with the eastern cities. The preparation of post-route maps for publication has been continued by the topo grapher, and is well advanced. The next amount of fines and deductions during the year was $56,302.09. The kinds was $53,627.50, a curtailment over tbe pre vious year of $38,088.36. FOREIGN MAIL SERVICE. The aggregate amount of postage sea, in land, and foreign upon the correspondence exchanged with foreign countries, was $2, 289,219.39, being an increase of $569,290.70 as compared with the previous year. The number of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries was 9,430,46. Tbe un tu ber of newspapers sent to foreign countries was 2,804,442, and the unmber received from foreign countries, 1,381.724, making a total of 4,186,166. The cost of trans-Atlantic mail service performed by steamships employed by this department was $525,307. 46. the cost of ocean transportation of mails to and from the West Indies was $57,871.69. The amount paid for sea and isthmus transporta tion of the mails exchanged with Central and South America, via Panama, was $17,377 .45. Balances against the United States on the settlement of the international postage ac counts amount in the aggregate to $278,714 19. -.' POSTAL CONVENTIONS. A liberal postal convention has been con cluded with Italy. A preliminary basis for a new postal convention with Great Britan has been agreed upon, which will result in a considerate reduction in tbe amount of ocean postage. APPOINTMENTS. ' Total number of officers in operation, 23. 828. Number of officers subject to appoint ment by the President, 709; number by the Postmaster-Geueral, 23,119. Total appoint ments made, 10,074. 

DEAD LETTERS, i The whole number of dead letters received was about 4,500,000. About 600,000 other letters were received, being unmailible for want of prepayment of postage, or on ac count of misdirection or illegible address. POSTAL MONET-ORDER STSTEM. The number of money-order offices now in operation- is 766. The value of the orders is sued during the year amounted to $3,977, 229.28. The proceeds of the system from its commencement np to the close of tbe last fis cal year amount to $90.82. - Tbe report concludes with an allusion to the bettering condition of postal affairs, and recommends several changes in existing laws as calculated to improve the efficiency of the department ; i a t ; While Governor Worth of North-Carolina was writing his message, in which he saga ciously recommends the deportation of the bulk of the laboring population ot tne State, a large number of his fellow-citizens, Mr. John Pool among them, who is one of the most respectable and ablest of North-Carolinians, were holding an agricultural meeting in Bertie County. - Bertie is one of thf finest counties in the State, productive of corn and cotton, washed on three sides by navigable waters, penetrated by a river deep enough to float any craft which can navigate any North : Carolina river, and the county town is with in a day's journey by steamboat of tbe city' of Norfolk. But two-thirds of all the land in Bertie is covered with a forest, and of the cleared land more than half is not under cul tivation. So, while the Governor is either clumsily sneering or is seriously recommend ing tb Legislature to take steps that would reduce still more of the State to a wilder ness, the farmers of Bertie naturally enough are passing resolutions pledging themselves to treat with civility and kindness Northern fanners who will come among them and set tle, and help to develop the resources of the country. It is not men like these who de liberately write or speak such folly as the, Governor has been guilty of. Indeed, such men as be, we are persuaded, are so few in number that it is not necessary to wish that ' tney might be made to try for a year or two life on the plantations, with no negroes and j . with their " quarters " full of Germans, say, . 1 or two factions of Irish, or Englishmen not fond t Indian corn. The Nation. i . Special Dispatch to the New York Tunes.' vr : ;. ALABAHA. ... A Special Message from Got. HMonHe .Beeon tnsndstheAdionqftAeChnsHtiUioiialAnwud- - mo.. -.. .v.. 'i- '. . Washington, Thnrsday, Dec, 6, f i The following special dispatch has b en re ceived from your correspondent dated Montgom ery, Ala., Dec 8: In a special message to-day Gov. Patton recommends the passage ot tbe Con stitutional Amendment by tbe Legislature. - He says that events now transpiring bear with peculiar force upon Alabama and its relations to the Union. To these events we cannot be indif ferent. They are of so vital a character that we should give them calm and deliberate considera tion. As the Chief Executive of the State, be deems it his duty to express his apprehension lest the stability of affairs be suddenly broken up: There is au unmistakable purpose among those who control Congress to enforce, at all hazards, their own terms of restoration. The measures they propose will reverse the present progress toward the establishment of permanent tran quility, and augment . the distress which now exists and inaugurate a confusion, the end of which no human prescience can foresee. . - To-day the cardinal principle of restoration seems to be the favorable action of tbe Constitu tional Amendment. Upon the merits of the Amendment his views are already known, and are founded on principle. The necessities of the case, i am now constrained to tntnK, are mner ent We should look our condition full in tbe face. I therefore recommend anew to your con sideration this measure in tbe light In which it now presents itself, or such other measure as your wisdom may suggest Should yon see proper to ratify the same, and full restoration follow, we may trust to time and the influence of our rep resentatives to mitigate its harshness. If, on the other hand, admisnion is delayed, the warning to onr sister States may be relied npon to 'prevent tbat concurrence on their part which alone can give the measure practical effect. . Having done all, we may then commit our cause to a just God. The message was referred in both Houses to the Committee on Federal Relations. Reorganization at the South. The unsatisfactory condition of affairs at the South is established by the reports of the military commanders stationed there. To many ot the statements enanating from that section, respecting outrages upon freedmen and other evidences of aversion to Federal control, we have paid little attention, believ ing that they were colored, if not invented for partisan purposes. But to the represen tations made by our military authorities in the Southerm States no suspicion can possi bly attach. Whatever be their opinions on controverted political questions, at any rate they are responsible and impartial They enjoy the well-earned confidence of the loyal people of the land, and their averments will undoubtedly be accepted as conclusive on questions of fact . On the important fact touching the treat ment of the freedmen, tbe testimony of tbe Generals is positive and unfavorable. An idea has obtained that South Carolina has done itself houor by tbe fullness of its pro visions for justice to the colored people. Gen. Sickles, however, reports that in some districts of that State the freedman is dependent upon the presence and protection of national troops for " security for life, limb or property." A prevailing indisposition to prosecute, and a failure to punish offenders when negroes are the sufferers is imputed to tne local autnonues ; and an extraordina ry State enactment is cited under which militia officers may " disperse, suppress, kill and destroy any company of freedmen or others who shall be lurking in any suspected place where tliey may do mischief. " From Kentucky, Gen. Davis reports an increase of lawlessness since the triumph of rebel candi dates at the election. Gen. Wood, writing troin Mississippi shows that laws remain in force prohibiting freedmen from purchasing real estate, and that only freedmen who have obtained a special license are permitted to bear arms. The inferior local authorities. too, are slow to proceed against rebel offen-. ders, who usually escape unpunished. Ucn. Sheridan, referring to affairs in Texas, speaks yet more positively. There, the General re marks, " tbe trial of a white man for the murder of a freedman would be a farce." And while a great outcry is raised when a single white settler is killed by Indians, " over the killing of many freedmen in the settlement nothing is done. Again, Arkansas has been singled out as by comparison a reconstructed State. It sent loyal men to Washington last Winter, and has seemed to be largely impregnated with .Northern influences. Encouraged, probably, by the position assumed bv the President, and the greater degree of boldness winch distinguishes the tone ot southern politicians on national affairs, the rebel ele ment in Arkansas has asserted its right to rule. Gov. Murphy is not an extreme man. as the manner in which he presented tbe pending Constitutional Amendment to the local Iiegislature, for ratification, proved. Apart from him, the State Government is. once more in rebel hands. The three mem bers of Congress elect were chosen because of the support they gave to the rebellion ; the state omcesrwith the exception ot tbe Exe cutive chair, have been assigned to conspic uous rebels ; a large majonty ot the .Legisla ture belong to the same class; and all the counties save three have given their minor local offices to men who have waged war against tbe Government The Union men of tbe State propose to meet in Convention to petition Congress for a grant of the same powers which were entrusted to them three years ago, when the work of reconstruction on its present basis was undertaken. The men who cooperated with Mr. Lincoln then ask now for power to begin anew, with the light of recent experience to guide them. 1 he mere issue of the call lor a gathering to petition has aroused the ire of the rebels in the State Legislature, who have talked of le gislation to aid the Governor in suppressing the movement Forcible suppression, after the style in vogue at New Orleans, is hardly likely to be attempted, and the Unionists. we presume, will make . themselves heard at Washington. North-Carolina seems no nearer bona fids reconstruction than other parts of the south. The election of an ultra Secessionist Jndge Manly, to the United States Senate, illus trates the predominant temper of the Legis lature. Ex-Gov. Holden one of President Johnson's appointees declares, in the Ral eigh Standard, of which he is the editor, that tbe Provisional Government experiment has been a failure ; that " tbe President was deceived, and his Provisional Governors were deceived;" tbat "all hope that existing Southern organizations will concur in meas ures necessary to restore the Southern States to the Union is at an end ;" and that M there is nothing left but to reorganize the South ern States." For this conclusion the repre sented States may not be fully prepared. But the expression of such an opinion in such a quarter is a sign of the times not to be overlooked, while the facts we. have col lated may help to familiarize ns with the outlines of the Southern position. ; : " l That any thing short of the surrender of the Union Party and principle will satisfy the present leaders of southern opinion we do not believe. Even President Johnson does not satisfy them ; for, though opposed to the Constitutional Amendment, the lang uage of his Message commits him to the sup- Eort of the test oath. But the 8outh will ave neither. It refuses to ratify the amend ment, and it demands the admission! . to Congress of whomsoever it may choose to send, rebel or no rebel. "We utterly reject his test oath," is the answer of the Richmond Examiner a ioumal which under ' its pres ent management is one of the most efficient exponents of Southern opinion. " We think the South would rather stay out of Congress indefinitely" than be represented by persons who would swallow the oath, is the state ment with which the Examiner disposes of Mr, Johnson's safeguard. . It is evident, therefore, that the Amendment is not the ob stacle to restoration. The real obstacle is the aversion of the Southern politicians to i everything calculated to insure the peace and integrity Ol tne nauou. xuey require mat they should dictate terms before resuming their places in the Union. 2r.

Nor jar can in terfere with the harmony of its working and no sudden shock can damage its machinery. Every piece Is made and finished by machinery (itself famous for its novelty, as well as for its effective ness) and is therefore properly made. The watch Is what all mechanism should be ACCURATE, SIMPLE, STRONG AND ECONOMICAL. Ex cept some high grades, too costly for general use, foreign watches are chiefly made by women and boys. Such watches are composed of several hundred pieces, screwed and riveted together, and require constant repairs to keep them in any kind of order. AH persons who have carried "ancres" "leplnes" and "English Patent Le vere," are perfectly well aware of the truth of this statement. At the beginning of our enterprise more than ten years ago, it was our first object to make a thoroughly gooi low priced watch for the mill ion, to take the place os these foreign imposi tions; the refuse of foreign factories, which were entirely unsaleable at home and perfectly worth less elsewhere. I low well we have accompolished this, may be understood from the fact that so many years of pnbUc trial, we now make MORE THAN HALF OF ALL THE WATCHES SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES, and that no others have ever given such universal satisfaction. While this de partment of our business is continued with in creased facilities for perfect work, we are at pre sent engaged in the manufacture of watches of the very HIGHEST GRADE KNOWN TO CHRONOMETRY, nnequaled by anything hither to made by ourselves, and unsurpassed by any thing made in the world. For this purpose we have the amplest facilities. We have erected an addition to onr main building expressly for this branch of our business, and have filled it with the best workmen in our service.. New machines and appt lances have been constructed which per form their work with consummate delicacy and exactness. The choicest and most approved ma terials only are used, and we challenge compari son between this grade of our work and the finest imported chronometers. We do not pretend to sell our watches for less mokey than foreign watches, but we do assert without fear of contra dicelon tbat for the saxx mokkt our product is incomparably superior. All our watches, of what ever grade, are fully warranted, and this warran tee is good at all times against ns or onr agents in all parts of the world. CAUTION. The public are cautioned to buy only of responsible dealers. All persons selling c ounterfeits will be prosecuted. ROBBINS & APPLETON, , . AGENTS FOR THE AMERICAN WATCH COMPANY, . 18 BROADWAY, I. T.

BEST STRENGTHENING PLASTER IN THE WORLD. Allcock's Porous Plasters resolve and assuage pain by calling forth the acrid humors from parts internal to the skin and general circulation thus, in many cases, positively evaporating the disease. JAMES LULL, M. D. There is nothing equal, in the way of a plaster, to the- Porous Elaster of Mr. ALLCOCK. Eve rything is pleasant about them. They are the plaster of the day, and fit type of our present ad vancement in science and art. In Asthma, Cough, Kidney Affections, Gout, Rheumatism, and local deep-seated pains, they afford permanent relief. J. F.

For general debility and exhaustation of the powers ot nature, whether occasioned by sick ness, fast living, constitutional decay, old age, or any other physical or mental cause, the one thing needful and indispensable is HOSTETTER'S CELEBRATED STOMACH BITTERS. When the fire of life seems to be absolutely dying out in the system, and the mind, sympathizing with the body, is reduced almost to a state of imbecility, this mighty Restorative seems, as it were, to Hit the sufferer out of the Slough of Despond, and re cruit and reinvigorate both the frame and the intellect. An old farmer in the Valley of tbe Monongahela writes thus to Dr. Hostetter: " I can compare the operation of your Bitters upon me to nothing but the effect of a rain after a long dry spell in the fall of the year. The rain felling on the meadows starts the second crop of grass', and your wholesome medicine seems to have started a second crop of life and spirits in me." And this is truly the effect of this grateful and powerful preparation Ladies of weak constitu tion, or whose strength -has been Impaired by sickness of age, find it a most efficacious and de lightful Tonic, and it is administered with , reat success, in marasmus or wasting of the flesh, to young children. In fact, it is a much safer and surer cordial for the nursery than anything ad vertised specially for that purpose. Nov. 28, 1866. . 48 lm. To Consumptives.
