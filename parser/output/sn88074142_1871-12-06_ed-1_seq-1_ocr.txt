With China, us well ns Japan, the cor- reipondcnce t rausmilted herewith shows that there Is no disposition on tho part of this government to swerve from its estab lished course. FURTHERANCE OF AMERICAN INTKRE.-T- IN JAPAN AND CHINA. To trivc importance and to ndd to tho efficiency of our diplomatic relations witli japan nnu unina, nnd '.o further us in re taining the good opinion of thoso people, and to secure to tho United St ites its sharo of the commerce destined to flow between these nations and tho balance of tho com mercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation bo inn'doto support at leaiit four American youths in each of these countries, to servo as n part of tho omciai lumilies ot our ministers there. Our representatives would not even then bu placed tiiion an eotislltv with tho representatives of Grcut llritian and somo other powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and mina nave to depend lor interpreters and translators upon tho native) of lhoo coun tries, who know our languor imperfectly, or procure for tho occasion tho services of employes in foreign business lioufC3, or tho interpreters to other furcigu ministers. 1 would nuo recommend liberal measures for tho purpose of uiding tho American lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco nnd Japan and China, and tho Australian line, which ure almost our only romaining lines of ocean steamers, and of increasing their service. THE COREAN TROUIII.ES. Prompted bv u desiro to put an eml to tho barbarous treatment of our .binwrr.lt. cd sailors on tho Coreun coant.I instructed our minister at i'okin to endeavor to eon. elude a convention with C'orea for secur ing the saiety and humane treatment cf such marincrr. Admiral llogers wus in structed to accompany him with u suffi cient force to protect him in caso of need. A small surveying pnrty, tent out, on reaching tho coast, was treaehcroukly at tacked at a disadvantage. Amplu oppor tunity was given for explanations and nn apology for thu Insult, hut neither came. A forco was thon landed, nnd after an arduous march over n ruggod anl difficult country, tho forts from which tho outrages had been commit tod were gallantly assaulted and destroyed. Having thus punished the crimlnals.'and having vindicated tho honor of tho flag, tho oxpodition roturncd. Finding it im practicable, under tho circtimstancos, to conclude tho desired conventiou, I respect fully rofer to tho correspondence relating thoroto, herewith submitted, nndleavo tho subject for such action as congress may seo fit to take, J THE REPUIILIl!

SPANISH WEST INKIER It Is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction which woro voluntarily (..uiiioeu oy mo statesmen oi spam havo not beoe carried out in its West Indian colonics. Tho laws nnd regulations for wie apparent nooiinon ol slavery in Cuba and 1'orto Itico havo molt of the laborers in bondago, with no hope of release until their lives becomo n burden to their em ployer. I deslro to direct your attention to tho lact mat citizens or tho United Stales aro largo holders In foreign lands of this spe cfc of property, forbidden by the funda mental law of their adopted country, and I recommend to congress to provide by stringent legislation u suitable remedy against the holding, owning or dealing in slaves, or being interested .lu slave prop erty in foreign lands, cither an'owne'rs, hirers or mortgagers bv purons of tho United States. THAN AFFAIRS. Ills to be regretted that the dUturbod condition of tho island of Cuba continues to bo it source of annoyance nnd anxiety. The existence- of a nrotracted strmn.ln i'n such clou proximity to our own territory, without any apparent prospect of an early termination, cannot b othnr tlmn m ) jectof concern to a peoplo who, while ab staining from interference in the affairs of other powers, naturally desire to lee every country In tho undisturbed enjovment o'f .. ii, . 1.. lfuv;e, iioirty ana mo blessings ot free in ailutioii". Our naval commanders in Cuban wa ters havo been instructed, incase it should become neceS!ary,to spare no effort to pro tect tho lives und property of bona-h'do j American citizens and to maintain thn luigniiyni tne ua i!....,... . ., 'loP that all pending questions. Willi witli Spain, crowiim out of tho affair of Cuba, may bo adjusted in the spirit of con ciliation which has hitherto guided tho two powers in their treatmont of such questions. REDUCTION OF THE KBIIV. The national debt has bece reduced to tho extent of $U,0o7,12C80 during the year, and by thu negotiation of national bonds nt n lower rate of lnteret, tho in terest of tho public debt has been so far diminished that now the urn to be raised for the interest account is nearly $17,000, 000 less than on the 1st of March, 180'J. It was highly desirablo that this diminution slii-uld take ploco both to strengthen tho credit of tho country, and eonvinco its citi.cn of their entire abiliU to meet evcrv dollar of liability without bankrupting them; but in view of tha accomplishment of those detirablo ends, of the rapid de velopment of tiic resources of the country, its increasing ability to meet largo de mands and thu nuiouut already paid, it is not desirablo that tho present resource? of tha country tliould ooritinuo to l. l...l1i. order to continue this rapid payment. I thcrcforo recommend a modiftcatiot: of both tariff and internal tax laws. 

AIIOLIHON OF INTERNAL TAXEC RECOM MENDED. I recommend that nil taxes from inter nal sources bo abolished except thoso on f piritiious, qinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its various forms, from stamps. In re adjusting tho tariff I suggest that a care ful citimatu be made of thu amount of sur plus rcveuuo collected under tho present laws after providing for tho current ex penses of the government the inter est account and a sinking fund, and that this Hirplus bi reduced in such manner as to afford tho greatest relief to tho greatest number. There aro many articles not produced at home, such as medicine and compounded essences, from which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into general use, all such articles I recom mend to bo placed on tho free list. If such n further reduction provo advisable. . ,1., .... . i wouiu men recommend i lint u no mado on thoso articles on which it can be dono without disturbing homo production or re ducing tho wages of American labor. I havo not entered into figures, becauso to do so would bo to repeat nil that is laid before you in the report of thu secretary of the treasury. 

COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS, In tho present laws for collecting reve- nuo you pay collectors of customs small salaries but provide for shares in ul seizures, which, nt the principal ports of entry particularly, raiso tho compensation of thcio officials to a large sum. It lias always s.'Cinel to mo that this system must at all times work perniciously. It holds out nn inducement to dishonest men. should such get possession of those offices, to oo lax in their scrutiny of goods en tered to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully Invited to this subject. 

HOLD FLUCTUATION!. Tho continued fluctuations In tho va!ue of gold as compared with national curron- cy bus ii most damaging effect upon tho ln- crcasu nnu uoveiopmcni oi tlie country, in keeping up the prices of nil articles neces- snry In evnry-day life, and fosters u spirit oi gruiuuiuig at ma national nuances, ii the question can bo met, sons to get a fixed vnluo to our currency, Hint valuu constant ly nnd unforinly approaching pnr with specie, ii very desirablo objoct will ko gained. ARMY MATTERS. For tho operations of tho army in tlie pnst year, the expense of maintaining it, thu estimates for tho cniulng ynar, and for continuing the sea coast and other Im provements conducted under tho supervis ion of thu war department, I refer you to thu accompanying report of the sccrotary of war. 1 call your attention to tho provisions of tho net of congress, npprovod March Urd, 1809, which discontinues promotions in tho stall corps of tho army until provided for by law. I recommond tint tho number of olllcors in each grado of tho staff corps bo fixed, and that whorover tho number in uny one grado fulls below the number so fixed, that tho vacancy may bo filled by promotion from tho grado below. I also recommond that when thu otlico of chieftif corps becomes vacant tho placo may bo filled by selection from tho corps in which tho vacancy exists. THE NAY Y llEPORT. Tho report of tlm secretary of tho navy ghows an Improvement in tho number and CAIRO, ILLINOIS, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER ij, 1371. efficiency In tho naval force, without ma terial Increase in thu oxpenso of support ing it. This is duo to tho policy which has beon adopted, and Is being oxtonded ns fait as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on tho several stations. Uy this means wo havo been en abled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising ground, to visit more frequently tho posts whero tho prcsenco of our flag i'j desirable, and generally to discharge offi cially tho approximate duties of tho navy in time of pcaco without exceeding tbo number of men or tho expenditures au thorized by law. During tho past year the navy has, fn addition to its regular service, supplied tho men and officers for tho vessels of tho coast survuy. and has completed tho survoys, as authorized by congress, of tho Isthmuses of Daricn and Tohuantepcc, and, under au thority, has sent an expedition, completely furnished and equipped, to explore, tho un known ocean of tho north. Tho suggestions of tho report as to tho necessity for increasing and Improving tho material of the navv. and tin- ulnn ri.pmn. minded for reducing tho personnel of tho service to a pcaco standard, by tho gradual abolition of certain irndni nf nnirini dm reduction of others, and tho employment of somo In tho lervlco of the conirnnrolnl marine, aro well considered, and descrvo tho thoughtful attention of congress. I also recommend that all promotions In tho navy nbovo captain bo bv selection In stead of hv senorll v. Thl nnnrtn mill an. euro ill tho higiierg"radcsgrc.iterefliciency, and hold out nn inccniivo to young of flcers to improve themselves in tho know ledge of their profession. I he present cost of maintaining tho navy, its cost compared with that of tho preceding year, mid tho estimates for tbo coming year, are contained in the accom panying report of the hocretnrv of the Now.

It is the index of the growth of education and thu prospcrty of iiio peopic two elements nigniy conduc tive to tho vigor and stability of the rc- pumics. s itn n vast territory like ours, much of it spar'ely populated," butull re quiring tiic services of tho mall, if Is not at present to be expected that this depart ment can be made self-sustaining, but a gradual approach to this end from year to year is confidently relied on, nnd" tho day is not far distant when tho l'ostofllco Department of tho government will provo u much general blessing to tho whole peo plo than It Is now. Tho suggestions of tiio Postmaster General for improvements in the depart ment presided over by him, aro earnestly recommended to your special attention, especially tho documents favorable to tho consideration of tho plan for uniting tho telegraph system of tho United States with tho postal system. It is believed that by such n course, tho cot of telegraph ing would bo much reduced, und tho ser vice as well, if not butter, rendered. It would secure n further advantage by ex tending tho telegraph through portions of tho country whero privato enterprise will not construct it. t'.immerci;, trade, and above all, tho effort to bring :i peo plo widely separated ir.to n community of intcrcts aro nlways benefited by "n rapid intercommunication. Education, tho ground work of republican institu tions, is encouraged by increasing tho fa- news from all parts of tho country, und the desiro to reap the benefit of such im provement will utimultitu education, I refer you to the report of tha Post master General for full dutniU of thn operations of last year, and for compara tive statement ot the rcull witli former years.
