President Cleveland Sends His Annual Message to the House and Senate. A Clear and, Forcible State ment Made of the Present Financial Relations. The Treasury Overflowing With Money Which Should Be in Circulation. Evils in the Present Tariff System — A State Paper Worth Reading-. Washington, Dec. 6.— The following message was sent to congress to-day: To the Congress of the United States: You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a condition of national finances which imperatively demands immediate and careful consid eration. The amount of money annu ally exacted, through the operation of the present laws, from the industries of the people, largely exceeds tiie sum necessary to meet the expenses of the government. When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantee to every citi zen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share towards the careful and economical maintenance of the government which protects him, it is plain that the exac tion of more than this is indefensible ex tortion, and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong, reflected upon those who bear the burden of national taxation, like otlier wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The public treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure, be comes A 

HOARDING PEACE for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and" the people's use, thus crip pling our national energies, suspending our country's development, preventing investment in productive enterprise. threatening financial disturbance and inviting schemes of public plunder. This condition of our treasury is not altogether new, and it has more than once of late been submitted to the peo ple's representatives in the congress, who alone can apply a remedy. And vet the situation still continues, with aggravated incidents, more than ever presaging financial convulsion and wide-spread disaster, It will not do to neglect this situation because its dan gers are not now plainly imminent and apparent. They exist none the less cer tainly, and await the unforeseen and unexpected occasion when suddenly they will be precipitated upon us. The SOth day of June, 1885. the excess of rev enue ovei public expenditures, after com plying with the annual requirements of the sinking fund act, was *1 7.859, 7&5.:54: during the year ended June 30, 1886. such excess amounted to .49,405,545.20; and during the year ended June 30, 1887, it reached the sum of $55,567,849.54. The annual contributions to the sinking fund during the three years above speci fied, amounting in the aggregate to {**158,058,320.94, and deducted from the surplus as stated, were made by calling in for that purpose outstanding 3 per cent bonds of the government. During the six months prior to June 30, 1887, the surplus revenue had grown so large by repeated accumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of the couutry, that the sum of *79,.64,100 of such sur plus was applied to the payment of the principal and interest of the 3 per cent bonds still outstanding and which were then payable at the option of the gov ernment. THE PRECARIOUS CONDITION of financial affairs among the people still needing relief, immediately after the 30th day of June, 1887, the remainder of the 3 per cent bonds then outstand ing, amounting with principal and in terest to .the sum. of .18,^77,500, were called in and applied to the sinking fund " contribution for the current fiscal year. -Notwithstanding these operations of the treasury department representa ' lions of distress in business circles not only continued but increased, and ab solute peril seemed at hand. -In these circumstances the contribution to the sinking fund for the current fiscal year was at once completed by the exnendit ture of .27,684,283.55 in the purchase of government bonds not yet due bearing 4 and 4*.< per cent interest, the premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per cent for the former and 8 per cent for the latter. In addition to this the interest ' accruing • during the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the government was to some extent anticipated, and banks selected as depositories of pub lic money were permitted to somewhat increase their deposits. While the ex pedients thus employed to release to the people the money lying idle in the treasury served to avert immediate dan ger, our surplus revenues have con tinued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amounting the Ist day of December to .55,-58,701.19. and esti mated to reach the sum of .113.00.. the 30tli of June next, at which date it is expected that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the sur plus in the treasury to .140,000,000. There seems to be no assurance that. with such a withdrawal from use of the peoples' circulating medium, our busi ness community may not in the near future be subjected to THE 

SAME DISTRESS which was quite lately produced from the same cause. And while the func tion^ of our national treasury should be few and simple, and while its best con dition would be reached, I believe, by its entire disconnection with private business interests, yet when, by a per version of its purposes, it idly holds money uselessly subtracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be rea son for the claim that some legitimate means should be devised by the govern ment to restore in an emergency, with out waste or extravagance, such money to its place among the people. If such an emergency arises there now exists no clear and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the re demption of 3 per cent bonds, which were payable at the option of the gov ernment, has afforded a means for the i disbursement of the excess of our reve nues: but these bonds have all been re tired, and there are no bonds outstand ing the payment of which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution I to the sinking, fund which fur- [ nishes the occasion for expendi- j tures in the . purchase of bonds has been already made for the current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. in the present state of legislation the only pretense of any ex isting executive power to restore, at this / " :g^fe§3ll§Pfe^ ■' " -iJSmGLOBE time, any part of our surplus revenues to the people by its expenditure const, 1 1 in the supposition that the secretary of the treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of the government not yet due at a rate of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of law from which such a power could be derived is found in an appropriation bill passed a number of years ago; and it is subject to the suspicion that it was intended as temporary and limited in its application, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and authority. No condition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single official, upon his judgment of its neces sity, to withhold from or release to the business of the people, in an unusual manner, money held in the treasury, and thus affect, at his will, the financial situation of the country; and IF it is 

DEEMED WISE to lodge in the secretary of the treasury the authority in the present juncture to purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested, and provided as far as possible with such checks and limitations as will define this official's right and discretion, and at the same time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to circulation the surplus money accumulating in the treasury, it should be borne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held as invest ments which cannot be purchased at I any price, and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell may un reasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the government. It has been suggested that the present bonded debt miglit be refunded at a less rate of in terest, and the difference between the old and new security paid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the treas ury. • The success of this plan, it is ap ! parent, must depend upon the volition j of the holders of the present bonds: and i it is not entirely certain that the induce i ment Inch must be offered them would result in more financial benefit to the government than the purchase of bonds, while the latter proposition would re i duce the principal of the debt by actual payment instead of extending it. The I proposition to deposit the money held ' by the government in banks throughout j the country for use by the people is, it ! seems to me, exceedingly objectionable | in principle, as establishing too close a ' relationship between the operations of the government treasury and the busi j ness of the country, and too extensive a ; commingling of their money, thus foster ing an unnatural reliance hi private business upon public funds. If this scheme should be adopted it should only he done as a • temporary expedient to ! meet an urgent necessity. Legislative j and executive efforts should generally be in the opposite direction, and should ! have a tendency to divorce, as much arid as fast as can safely be done, the treas ury department from private enterprise. j Of course it is not expected that unnec essary and extravagant appropriations will be made for the purpose of avoid ing the accumulation of an excess of revenue. Such expenditure, beside the demoralization of all just conceptions of public duty which it entails, stimulates a habit of '. ; •-."_ .•: ... . 

RECKLESS IMPROVIDENCE not in the least consistent with the mis sion of our people or the high and bene ficial purposes of our government. I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen, as well as to the attention of their repre sentatives charged with the responsi bility of legislative relief, the gravity of our financial situation. The failure of the congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the difficulty must necessarily produce, caused a con dition of financial distress and appre hension since your last adjournment, which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within ex ecutive control, and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued inaction of congress, the responsibility must rest where it belongs. Though the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which should be fully recognized, and though it presents features of wrong to the people as well as peril to the coun try, it is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause, " constantly reproducing the same alarming circum stances—a congested national treasury and a depleted monetary condition in the business of the country. It need hardly by stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicament in "the future by the removal of its cause. Our scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is taken from the people and put into the public treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors, It must be conceded that none of the things sub jected to internal revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessaries; there ap pears to be no just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. ! But our present, tariff laws, the vicious, ; inequitable and illegal source of 

UNNECESSARY TAXATION, i ought to be at once revised and I amended. These laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the price to con sumers of all articles imported and sub ject to duty by precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for use these imported articles. Many of these things, how ever, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and the duties now* levied upon foreign goods : and products are called protection to these home manu facturers, because they render it possi ble for those of our people who are man ufacturers to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the imported goods that have paid customs duty. "So it happens that while comparatively a few use the imported articles, millions of our people, who never use and never saw any of the foreign products, purchase ami use things of the same 'kind made in this country, aud pay therefor nearly or quite the same charged price which the duty adds to the imported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into the public treas ury, but the great majority of our citi zens, who buy domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least approxi mately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruction, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestic prod ucts, as was as those who. consume im ported articles, and thus impose a tax upon all our people. It is not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation, It must be extensively con i tinued as the source of the government's ! income, and in a readjustment of our I tariff the interests of American lal_>r ! engaged in manufactures should be | carefully considered, as well as the i preservation of our manufactures. It may be called protection or by any other name, but relief from the hard ships and dangers of our present tariff law should be devised with especial precaution against imperiling the exist ence of our manufacturing interests. But this existence should not mean a condition which, without regard to the 

SAINT PAUL, MINN., WEDNESDAY • MORNING, DECEMBER 7, 1887— TWELVE PAGES. public welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realization of IMMENSE PROFITS instead of moderately profitable re turns. As the volume and diversity of our national activities increase, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuation of the advantages which they conceive the present system of tariff taxation directly affords them. So ■ stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present condition been resisted by those of our fellow citizens thus engaged that they can hardly complain of the suspicion, entertained to a certain ex tent, that there exists an organized com bination all along the line to maintain their advantage. We are in the midst of centennial celebrations, and with be coming pride we rejoice in American skill and ingenuity, in American energy and enterprise, and in the wonderful natural advantages and resources de veloped by a century's national growth. Yet when an attempt is made to justify 1 a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers, quite be yond a reasonable demand for govern mental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to call our manufactures in fant industries, still needing the highest and greatest degree of favor and foster ing care that can be wrung from federal legislation, lt is also said that the in crease in the price of domestic manu facture resulting from the present tariff is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our workingmen em ployed in manufactories, than are paid for what is called pauper labor of Europe. All will acknowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our laboring people. Our labor is hon orable in the eyes of every American citizens; as is lays the foundation of our development and progress, it is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. The standard of our laborer's life should not be measured by that of any other country less favored. I and they are entitled to their full share j of all our advantages, lIV THE 

LAST CENSUS it is made to appear that of the 17,:'9_, --09.) of our population engaged in all kinds of industries. 7,670,4.3 are em ploye! in agriculture, 4,074,_38 in pro fessional and personal service <_,'_l4.S''7 of whom are domestic servants and la borers), while 1,810,256 are employed in trade and transportation and 3,8-7.112 are classed as employed in manufactur ing and mining. For present purposes, however, the last number should be considerably reduced. Without attempt ing to enumerate all, it will be conceded that there should lie deducted from these which it includes 375,143 carpen ters and joiners, 28., 401 milliners, dress makers and seamstresses, 17_,7__ black smiths. 133, 756 .tailors and tailoresses, 102,473 masons, 7*1,241 butchers, 41,309 bakers, 22,083 plasterers and 4,8111 en gaged in manufacturing agricultural implements— amounting in aggregate to 1,214,023, leaving 2,'*'_*.,oß_ persons em ployed in such manufacturing industries as are claimed to be benefited . by a high tariff. To these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain their wages by resist ing a change. There should be no dis position to answer such suggestions by the allegation that they are in a minority among those who ... labor, . and therefore should forego an advantage in the interest of low prices for the majority; their compensation, as may be affected by the operation of tariff laws, should at all times be scrupu lously kept in view; and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the fact that they are consumers with the rest; that, they, too, have their own wants and those of their families to supply from their earnings, and that the price, of the necessaries of life, as well as the amount of their wages, will regulate the measure of r ".- 

THEIR WELFARE AND COMFORT. But the reduction of taxation demand ed should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the working man nor the lessening of his wages; and the profits still remaining to the manufac turer, after a necessary readjustment, should furnish no excuse for the sacri fice of the interests of his employes, either in their opportunity to work or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the worker in manufactories fail to understand that while a high tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wages, it certainly results in a very large in crease in the price of nearly all sorts of manufactures, which in almost count less forms he needs for the use of him self and his family. He receives at the desk of his employer his wages, and perhaps before he reaches his "home is obliged, in a purchase for family use of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of the increase in price which the tariff per mits, the hard-earned compensation of many days of toil. The farmer and the agriculturists who manufacture nothing, but who pay the increased price which the tariff imposes upon every agricul tural implement, upon all he wears,and upon all he uses and owns, except the increase of his flocks and herds and such things as his husbandry produces from the soil, is invited to aid in main taining the present situation, and he is told that A 

HIGH DUTY on imported wool is necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear, in order that the price of their wool may be increased. They, of course, are not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, in his purchase of clothing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer as well to the manufacturer and merchant; nor is any mention made of the fact that the sheep owners them selves and their households must wear clothing and use other articles manu factured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must return their share of this increased Sr ice to the tradesman. 1 think it may c fairly assumed that a large propor tion of the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks, numbering from twenty five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is ten cents each pound if of the value of 30 cents or less, and 12 cents if of the value of more than 30 cents. IF THE I.IHEHAL ESTIMATE of six pounds lie allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be 00 or 72 cents and this may be taken as the utmost en hancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars wbuld thus represent the increased price of the wool from twenty-five sheep and ,30 that from the wool of fifty sheep, and at present values this addi tion would amount to about one-third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer receives this or less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in all the changes will adhere to it, until it reaches the consumer. When manu factured into cloth and other goods and material for use, its cost is not only in creased to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a further sum has been added for the profit of the manufacturer under the operations of other tariff laws. In the meantime the day arrives when the _ farmer .. finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe" himself and family for the winter. When he faces the trades man for that purpose he discovers tliat he is obliged not only to return, in the way of increased prices, his tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which then per- C'outinuetl on FiT- *h Pnge,

DICKINSON. A Sketch of the Michigan States man Who Enters- the Cabinet. Don M. Dickinson is in his forty-first year and comes of American stock on both side's,' through generations running back to the. seventeenth century. On his father's side he is descended from the, Massachusetts Dickinsons, and on his mother's from the Uolmses, who were with Roger Williams at the Providence plantations. His father was a man of rare intellect and high cultivation. Cir cumstances made it necessary for young Dickinson to earn his own way to edu cation, and he . accomplished it at school and college with his - own means, gained at first by manual labor and later by an exceptional capacity and judgment for all business, and a re markable faculty for turning off work and for responsibility. Admitted to tne bar when barely twenty-one. he rose rapidly in his profession, and from the age of twenty-five he had been a leading lawyer in his state, and lrora the age of thirty one of- the first coun sel in the Northwest. His name has been associated as counsel in nearly every famous litigation in Michigan, and in the supreme court of the United States, his record of successes has been brilliant. Mr. Dickinson's contest in behalf of the state courts against the alleged invasion of their jurisdiction by the federal judiciary under the bank ruptcy law was quasi-political in its character, and in -the supreme court of the United States, in the Le Roux case, after - seven years of defeats in the lower courts, his position was sustained. His latest widely known appearance in that court was in the great telephone contest where he made the leading argument for Drawbaugh against Bell, and associated with Senator Edmunds and Lysander Hill. His professional income runs from 130,000 to 160,000 per annum. In politics Mr. Dickinson is a Jeffer sonian Democrat, believing in domestic self-government, a strict construction of the constitution, and opposing class legislation, in which he embraces | all protective laws. But he advises care and caution in dealing with protection as it exists. He has been a recognized leader of his party since he attained his majority. Mr. Dickinson's first vote was cast for Horatio Seymour. He was secretary of the state central committee at twenty-four, and chair man of the Tilden campaign of 1870, when twenty-eight, conducting one ot the most vigorous cam paigns Michigan has known, and doing a great part in reducing ; the 60,000 Re publican major ity to 20,000 plurality. He was close in Gov. Tilden's counsels lx>th in IST 6 and lsso. He was on terras of friendship with that distinguished man. Mr. Dickinson was delegate at large to the convention of ISBO, and chairman of the Michigan delegation. Since 1884 he has represented Michigan on the na tional committee. Mr. Dickinson has constantly refused the use of his name as a candidate for congress or for any other office. The only public position he ever held was that of visitor to the United States naval - academy, the ex penses and emoluments of which he de voted to that institution. Mr. Dickin son is a man calculated to make an emi nently efficient cabinet officer. .."*.' L. Q. C. LAMAR. \'X[ The Record of the New Member of f ■£_•"; . the Supreme Court..

He is a man of striking features and independ ent character. His hair is worn long, and he would look like a typical pro fessor of theology but for the fact that his mustache and goatee are fierce enough to produce the effect of trans forming his pleasant face into the make up of an Italian bandit. His gait and manner are those of a man who thinks profoundly and who is utterly indiffer ent to his surroundings. The affairs of the interior department have bothered him but little. He wisely left much to his subordinates. They love to work ; and show their zeal. Lamar permits them to do so. "" x-xxy THE 

HOUSE JOURNAL CLERK. A Change Made Which Has Caused Considerable Comment. Washington, Dec. The principal topic of conversation this morning among members on the floor of the house was the change made last even ing by Clerk Clark in the office of jour nal clerk. John C. Robertson, who was appointed to succeed Mr. Smith as jour nal clerk, took the oath of office this morning and after a consultation with his predecessor began at once the dis charge of his duties. He is from In dianapolis, was formerly a judge of the Indiana court and held for a time the position of journal clerk to the state senate. It is rumored that Mr. Smith will make a fight for reinstatement and that a Michigan Democratic member will offer a resolution providing for an inquiry Into the vague statements that have been made to the effect that the change was the result of a promise by the Indiana Democrats to su"> port the clerk of the house in his candidacy for re-election if the office of journal clerk was given to an Indiana man. and Don M. Dickinson had de manded Smith's removal. When Mr. Clark, the clerk of the house, was spoken to on the subject this morning he declared positively that Mr. Dickin son had not communicated in any way with him in regard to the matter. He had 'intended- to make the charge last session.'he said, but had deferred action : for various reasons. No member of the Indiana' delegation had been consulted upon the appointment or knew of his intention to. make a charge, save Repre sentative Matson. who had been re quested to furnish some information concerning Mr. Robertson's record. Mr. (lark denied' in the strongest terms that there had been any understanding be tween himself and the Indiana delega tion relative to his candidacy for the of fice! of clerk. In all these statements he was corroborated by Representative Horman and other Indiana Democratic representatives. CONGRESS. After Hearing the President's Message Both Houses Adjourn. * f Washington, Dec. After ' the reading of the journal in the senate to day the presiding officer aaked whether it was the pleasure of the senate to pro ceed with the usual morning business. Mr. Harris suggested that bills and me morials might be -introduced and re ferred. Mr. Hoar opposed the propo sition, stating that it was an ancient custom of the senate not to enter upon any business until after hearing the communication from the president at the beginning of the session. That was.a. mark of respect due from the leg islative department of the government to the executive. He therefore rhoved i a recess for half an hour. The . motion •was agreed to. Afterjthe feces, had "been extended for a quarter of an hour longer r Mr. Morrill .reported' that the joint committee appointed to wait upon the president 'had been ■ informed ' that the president would . Immediately com municate* with "congress* in writing. Thereupon Mr. O. L. Pruden, one of the president's secretaries, presented sev eral messages in writing, and the pre siding officer, laid before the senate the president's annual message. Mr. Mc- Cook, secretary of the senate, at five minutes past 1 commenced the reading of the message. This was concluded at half past 1, when the senate adjourned. THE 

HOUSE. The proceedings of the house this morning were opened with prayer by the chaplain. Mr. Mills, of Texas, offered a resolution directing the speaker to appoint the committees on rules, accounts, enrolled bills and mileage, each to consist of the same number of members and as is provided for by the rules of the Forty-ninth con fress, and referring the rules of the orty-ninth congress to the committee on rules when appointed. Adopted. Mr. Cox, of New York, chairman of the committee appointed to wait upon the president and inform him of the organ ization of the house, , reported that the committee had performed its duty and that the president would communicate with the house forthwith. The follow ing amendments to the rules were sub mitted to be referred to the committee on rules when appointed : . <-X: By Mr. Dingley, of Maine, providing that pending a motion that the house go into committee of the whole or proceed to business on the house calendar, a motion shall be in order to designate the particular bill to be considered. Also for the appointment of a committee on navigation and fisheries to consist of thirteen members. ...-;: By Mr. Anderson, of Kansas, provid ing that ex-members of the house shall not be admitted to the floor more than three days during the same term of congress. ■. •■ y.r By Mr. Stone, of Missouri, giving pre cedence in consideration to bills re ported by the committee on public lands for the forfeiture of land grants and re storing them to bona fide settlement. By Mr. Cox, of New "fork, for the ap pointment of a committee on the elev enth census. By Mr. Johnson, of North Carolina, providing that when any motion or proposition to amend the revenue laws is under consideration any amendment thereto or substitute therefor, whether it refers to internal or customs revenue, shall be in order. At 12:20 a recess was taken until 12:40 and a subsequent recess until 1:10. At the expiration of the recess Mr. Pruden, the president's private secretary, ap peared at the bar of the house with the president's annual message, It was re ceived and its reading immediately begun. The message was listened to with great attention and at the conclu sion of the reading, which consumed forty minutes, was greeted with ap plause. The house then at 1:50 ad journed until Thursday. THE 

MESSAGE. General Opinion of Congressmen Regarding the Document. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. While the president's message was not of an en tirely unexpected character, yet the pro tectionists could not help being startled at its bold sentences.* The greatest at tention' was accorded . the reading, par ticularly by the Republicans. Satisfac tion was shown ... on .' the face of every tariff reformer in the ' house, and some of the enthusiasts were almost hyster ical in their ! suppressed feelings. Mr. Springer's face was, wreathed in smiles and Mr. Mills sat with a hand at each ear with a look of pleasure on his face. Mr. Randall sat quietly in his seat, giv ing marked attention till the reading was nearly through, when he took up the printed copy of the message and began reading for himself. The message seemed to cause more of a sensation among the Republicans than with the Democrats. •. Nearly every one pro nounced it an unique document and de cidedly forcible. The reading of the president's message in the senate was listened to with attention, but very many of the senators after adjourn ment, upon being asked for their opin ion of the document, said they pre ferred to examine it more closely be fore declaring themselves. The judg- ! ment of the senate may be summarized generally by stating that the Democrats pronounce it an able state paper, while j the Republicans say it is a free trade message, intended to influence the house in behalf of free trade legislation. 

GETTING EVEN. An Offensive Partisan Maligning Public Printer Benedict. Special to the Globe. ■ Washington, Dec. 6.— Public Printer Benedict discovered an exceedingly offensive partisan, and treated him to an exceedingly effective bounce. The dismissed Blaineite is now traveling the length and breadth of Newspaper row telling his grievances and inducing Republican correspondents to publish scandalous stories concerning Mr. Bene dict. He says that there were agents of the New York Democracy admitted to the government printing office for the purpose of assessing the employes and taking their money for campaign pur poses. He avers that men and women alike were compelled to contribute to the fund under threat of dismissal from the service. There seems to be no foundation for the story. If such assess ments were made they were made with out the knowledge or consent of Mr. Benedict. The employes of the govern ment printing office who have been questioned know nothing of the case. Several of them are hold-over Republi cans, and would willingly tell of such a thing if it were true. But they one and all deny it. However, the lie is travel ing the rounds, and it may as well be nailed before it grows into a big libel. Nelson and Lind. Special to the Globe. .Washington, Dec. 6.— Congressmen Lind and Nelson are at the National. Mr. Lind says it is not yet determined whether his wife will join him soon or not. If she does, and he will know within a week, it will be necessary to take quarters elsewhere. If she does not come, he will remain ' at the Na tional. Mr. Nelson has had an inter view with the landlady under whose hospitable roof he formerly resided. It is probable that he will" soon remove either to that house on Fourteenth street, or take quarters in the same neighborhood. /__. ; ■j..■y ; - • ' > J * - Nelson Favors the Bill.

FRENCH REPUBLIC. A Prospect that the Various Re- publican Groups Will Coalesce. Paris, Dec. 6.— lt is expected that M. Goblet will be prime minister in the new cabinet, and that M. Flourens will retain the portfolio of minister of for eign affairs. The chambers have ad journed until Saturday. A subscription tion has been started to raise a fund for the purpose of erecting a monument to the great Carnot, grandfather of the president. The extremists still continue to oppose the retention of Gen. Saussier as governor of Paris. ' President Sadi- Carnbt, in an interview with M. Cle menceau to-day insisted upon the neces sity of a union of all the Republicans in the chambers, first to. show foreigner, that Republicans can _give,|and second in order that they may vote an . honest and. sincere . budget. M. .Clemenceau fully indorsed the president's, views. The -accord between President Sadi- Carnot and M. Clemenceau is regarded as a good omen of the future of the re public. The president to-day received M. Ribot and other leading politicians. President Carnot appears to be more than ever master of the situation. His insistence upon the cohesion of the Re publicans, has met with general ac quiescence on the part of the leaders of the groups, and the pledge of support to the new executive by M. Clemenceau removes any possibility of an opposi tion strong enough to obstruct business or cause the government to swerve in the slightest from the conservative pol icy mapped out. M. Sadi-Carnot in an interview with M. Clemenceau to-day said lie was under no illusion that he had been chosen as president for his own merits. . He had an earnest desire to do his duty and sink self on every occasion when his per sonal views might conflict with the pub lic interest. While admitting that there must always exist two great republican parties, the president said it would be possible in elections for them to unite against their common enemy, the monarchists. M. Clemenceau, replying, deprecated the idea of taking men from the various groups to form the cabinet, irrespective of their platforms. He said a union of the parties could be better effected on the adoption of certain principles as a basis of action. Sullivan Removed. Dublin, Dec. C— Lord Mayor Sulli van, who was convicted of publishing in his paper, the Nation, accounts of pro claimed branches of the National league and sentenced to two months' imprison ment, has been removed to the Tulla more jail, in order to prevent his hold ing daily levees, as he was doing in the jail here. The removal of Lord Mayor Sullivan from Dublin to Tullamore was an act of petty persecution, whice Is be neath contempt. Ostensibly the change was made to prevent the lord major from holding receptions in the jail, which, it was claimed, partook of the character of ovations to the distin guished prisoner; but the real object of his removal was to make his term of in carceration as unpleasant and impose upon him as great a degree of hardship as possible, since his sentence does not permit his keepers to exact the perform ance of labor. The Dublin magistrates will continue their visits to Mr. Sulli van, however, there being no way in which they can legally be prevented. Mr. Sullivan is still lord mayor of Dub lin, and in such capacity cannot be de barred from consultation with the mag istrates of the city, nor can the latter be denied their right to confer with their superior officer. * They Want Gilhooly. Dublin, Dec. The police are actively endeavoring to arrest Mr. Gil hooly, member of parliament' for Cork, who has taken refuge with Mr. Pyne in Lisfinney castle, which is prepared to defy the police.

Washington, Dec. 6.— The wife of an ex-member of congress from Minne sota is expected here to play a leading role in society during the winter. Dur ing the last days of her husband's term, not many years ago, she made it her business to say a great many abusive ' things concerning a prominent Minne sota lady, and those sayings have come to the ears of the injured and aggrieved party. If the wife of the ex-congress man is wise she will defer her visit, be cause there is a league formed which - might make her stay rather unpleasant; ana she would not reign as an un questioned queen. Those little, spite ful things which women say about each other sometimes react, and become dan gerous as boomerangs. But women will . be jealous of each other; and, being jealous, they are frequently unwise. • Congressman Wilson a Pedestrian Special to the Glooe.
