CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE BEGINS RAILWAY INQUIRY Proposed by President to Bet ter Condition of Ca riors, MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM Officials of Roads Prepared to Advocate Federal Incorporation, Supervision of Securities and Extension of Authority of Interstate Commerce Commirsion. Washington. Nov. 20.-Ten members of Congress, five Senators and five members of the [louse of llepresenta lives, hegan here today an inquiry into the subject of public control and su pervislon of railroads that may lead to the revolutionizing of the whole scheme of governmental regulilt ol) of I1h c('wnt try's transportation lines.

Sims of Tennessee. Cullop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin and Hamilton of Michigan. The In quiry was recommended by President Wilson in his message to Congress in December of last year. He described as its purpose to determine what could be done "for bettering the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole." Prominent Men as Witnesses. In order to obtain the views of all interests affected by the operations of the transportation lines the committee has invited prominent shippers, hank ers, representatives of commercial or ganizations. railway executives, econo mists and others to appear before them. The first to be heard are railroad commissioners of various states who began their evidence today. Their testimony is directed chiefly to oppos ing any enlargement of the federal authority over commerce that would detract from the powers now exercised by state bodies. They will be followed shortly by officials of railway labor organizations who are expected to reg ister their opposition to the increase of governmental authority over wages and conditions of labor. Chief interest in the hearings cen ters in the proposals that will be put, forward by representatives of the rail roads, for it is reported that they wi!l advocate an extension of federal au thority over rates and securities to the practical exclusion of state control of these matters. It is understood also that they will go on record in favor of fed eral incorporation of all railroad lines. Legislative Program of Railroads. From an authoritative source is, ob tained the following outline of the leg islative program which the railroads will ask the committee to consider in its investigation: They will endeavor to demonstrate to the commission that one of the principal defects in the pres ent system of railroad regulation is the lack of coordination resulting from the simultaneous and conflicting regu lation by the federal government and by the 48 states. They will, therefore, ask that entire governmental control of the rates and practices of interstate carriers, except purely local matters, be placed in the hands of a federal body so that interstate traffic may be regulated without reference to state lines, leaving to the state commissions jurisdiction only over local matters and local public utilities. As a part of this plan, a compulsory system of federal incorporation is to be recommended, accompanied by federal supervision of railroad stock and bond issues. A reorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be asked. in order to enable the commission prop erly to exercise its increased powers. It is also proposed that the preparation and prosecution of cases against the railroads shall be delegated to some other agency of the government, possi bly the Department of Justice, so that the commission may devote its ener ries to its administrative functions. With the commission thus relieved of some of its present duties and equip ped to handle its business more prompt ly, the railroads will urge that the pe riod during which the commission may now suspend proposed increases in rates be reduced from ten months to 60 days. with provision for reparation to be paid to the shippers if the ad. vance shall be declared unreasonable. They will also ask that the commis sion be given the power to prescribe minimum as well as maximum rates so that in meeting complaints of dis crimination the commission may order the advance of a rate which it consid ers too low. One of the most important recom mendations for which the railroads will ask favorable consideration is that the commission he specifically authorized to take into account in rate regulation the effect of rates upon total earnings in the light of ex penses. While the Newlands Committee is required, under the resolution creat ing it, to submit a report by January 2 next, it is not anticipated that the Committee will have come anywhere near completing its labors then. NEW 

POLICY NEEDED IN GOVERNMENT RAILWAY CONTROL Helpfulness and Encouragement Urged by Alfred P. Thom. CREDIT MUST BE IMPROVED Increase of Transportation Facilities Necessary to Secure Relief From High Cost of Living May Thus Do Provided For by the Railroads. Washington, Nov. 28.-A new policy of government railroad regulation, based on constructive principles of helpfulness and encouragement instead of upon principles of repression and punishment, was urged by Alfred P. Thom, counsel for the Hallway Execu tives' Advisory Committee, the first witness on behalf of the railro.,ls be fore the Newlands Joint Committee on Interstate Commerce, which has insti tuted a general inquiry into the prob lems of railroad regulation. "It is proposed by the joint resolu tion of Congress," said Mr. Thom, "to go into a comprehensive study of the whole subject of transportation, to make a new assessment. after 29 years of experiment, of its history, its pres ent conditions and its future needs. The railroads accept the view that reg ulation is a permanent and enduring part of government in America and that the first duty of the carriers is to the public. That duty Is to afford reasonable facilities on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates, and this must be done before any private inter ests can be considered." Certainty, Safety and Sufficiency. AMr. Thom contended that the real in terest of the public is in being assured of certainty, safety and sufficiency of transportation facilities, rather than in rates. The first consideration of the public is to obtain transportation facili. ties. What the cost is. is in reality a second consideration, he said. Mr. Thom proposed an increase of transportation facilities as a metuod of securing relief from the high cost of living. '"There have been less than 1,000 miles of new railroad construct ed in the United States during the past year," le said, "less than In any year since 1848, except the period of the Civil War, and yet the cost of living is daily advancing owing to a shortage of supplies which might be remedied by securing access to new areas of pro duction. Credit Must Be Improved. "This leads to the consideration as to whether railroad credit is as good as the public interest requires. It is im possible for railroads to earn enough to supply the necessary new facilities from current revenue. They must he provided from credit. Investors can not be coerced, but must he attracted." Among the conditions affecting rail road credit which deter investors he mentioned the following: "First, Railroad revenues are not controlled by investors, but are fixed and limited by governmental authority and not by one but by several govern mental authorities, which do not recog nize responsibility for assured results to investors and are uncoordinated. "Second, Railroads cannot control and the government cannot and does not limit the expense account. "Third, The present system of regu. lation is based on a policy of regulation and correction and not on a policy of helpfulness and encouragement. "Fourth, The outstanding obligations of the railroads have already exceeded the financial rule of safety and involve a disproportionate amount of obliga tions hearing fixed charges. "Fifth, The investor must accept a subordinate obligation or security wit Ii nolassurance of a surplus of earning, to support It. "Sixth, Other competitive lines of in vestment present superior attractions. "Seventh, The railroad business is largely controlled by political instead of business considerations. Look Forward, Not Back. "We may debate about what tias caused the present conditions," said Mr. Thom, "but we cannot debate about what the people need. The President has taken the view that we must look forward in this matter and 'make a fresh assessment of circumstances' in order to deal helpfully and intelligent ly with the problem. Abuses are no more prevalent in the railroad bugi ness today than in any other business humanely conducted. The great ques tion now is whether the existing sys tem of regulation gives the public re liable assurance of sufficient present and future railroad facilities. - 'Those who oppose any change must make their appeal on the ground that the present systems assure the public of the continued adequacy of trans portation facilities. If they do not, no argument based on the desirability of the present dual system of regulation will be accepted by public judgment. The question of 'states' rights' is not involved. If the regulation of transpor tation facilities privately owned should fail government ownership must fol low, and then all power of the states over the railroads would disappear. *'Let us debate this question, then, not upon any mere theory or jealousy to to the distribution of governmental power, but upon the large issue of what the public interest requires In respect of the assurance of adequate transportathe ter ie.'"
