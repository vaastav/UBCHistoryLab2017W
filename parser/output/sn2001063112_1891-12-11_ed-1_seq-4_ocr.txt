Sioux City Journal: Senator Kyle took his seat"on the Democratic side' of the senate. South Dakota hardly ex pected it. Oh ves, she did. The Yankton Press swings oat the sug gestion that that town will be a first class place in which to hold the Repub lican convention to select delegates to Minneapolis. The Normal Topic comes to hand from Madison with the name of A. B. Hall as editor. It is a neat four-page leaflet devoted to the interests of the State Normal School at Madison. We regret to see signs of the oldtimc ill feeling between St. Paul and Minne apolis. It is really too bad that the era of harmony could not have lasted until St. Paul had secured the Democratic national convention—though ix-rhaps :.it is too much to expect that it could last so long as that. Mills takes his defeat sorely to heart. He refused to act on one of the informal committeos which are usually appointed •Iat the opening of the session, and now comes the rumor that he threatens to resign But he will not. Of his stamp few die and none resign. Besides his services will be needed later on to as sist ex-Czar Reed in making it interest ing for Crisp and his followers when they attempt to straddle on the tariff ^question. The current number of the Ruralist has on its front page a cartoon repre senting two stalwart men each thrusting ,a sword into the body of another indi vidual, labeled the money power, be fore the door of a bank. We would suggest as a subject for the next car toon a wild-eyed anarchist hurling a grip-sack full of dynamite at the feet of a capitalist who refuses to give up a million and a quarter on demand. It would lie even truer to life, and would tend to further inflame the passions and prejudices of the class off of which the Ruralist and its ilk are living. In this .connection the following comments of the Pioneer Press are peculiarly appro priate Reckless denunciation of "capitalist classes"and the "money power" is exact ly the preparation to lead unsettled minds to maniacal deeds like this at tempt upon the life of Mr. Sage. It is just as true now as ever it was "that they who »6w the wind must reap the whirl wind: and the people of these United States are in need of nothing at present more sorely than some sober enforce ment of the principles of law and order. The wild gospel of class hatred and so cialism and communism has never vet been written in anything but blood. An Independent newspaper writer brings forward the railroads of Ger many and their rates as a strong argu inent in favor of government ownership, and says: The government management of the railway finances has also been a bril liant success. surpassing all expectations. In Prussia alone last year, after paying us.-the interest and part of the principal on the bonded debt, there was a surplus of S2u.000.000. If government ownership involves transportation at cost why is it that Prussia alone shows a surplus of i25. 000,000 when that surplus represents just so much money unnecessarily taken from the people who pay the freight? The facts are, however, that in no coun try under the sun are railroad rates so low and the average service so good as in the United States. In an "able article in the current number of the North American Review Gen. Hoi-ace Porter, an acknowledged railroad auth ority, presents the following table to show the relative average rate per mile in the different countries: United Kingdom 4.42 cents. Prance 3.83 .ents. Germany 3.10 cents. United States 2.12 cents. In all of these countries, to a greater or less extent, the government is inter ested in the management of the rail- out as furnishing the most favorable example of government ownership, the rate per mile is nearly one cent greater than in this country with all the advan tages of dense population and short mile age in favor of the former. Not very long since the third party people were claiming the election of at least forty members of the new con gress. and were quite confident that these would all stay out of the Demo cratic caucus. But what do the figures of the recent speakership struggle show? Eight lone third partyites. headed by the once noted Simpson, Hocked into the Independent caucus, or rather voted all by themselves in the house when the result of the Democratic caucus came up for ratification. The remain der of the forty were enlisted under either the Crisp, the Mills, the Springer, the McMillen or the Hatch banner just as though no third party had ever been heard of. Some of the New York papers are poking fun at Minneapolis because of the report that the wolves hang around the outskirts of the town in which the National Republican convention will be held. The following from the New York Press, however, has nothing fun ny about it, and goes far to show that the stray Minnesota wolf is far less of a nuisance than the ever present Tam many tiger. The Press says: The first white man who crossed Man hattan Island from the banks of the Hud son to the river upon the east, chopping his way through the trees, watching for bears and wildcats, stepping on snakes and dodging Indians, progress ing painfully through the virgin forest, ran less danger to life and limb than the citizen of New York who, in this year of our Lord 189], ventures to walk from West street to Water street through any of the big thoroughfares. Ruralist: Loucks's two salaries for one man's time were whittled down from 42.400 to $1,800 as a further en couragement of his good work.—MITCH ELL 

REPUBLICAN. THE REPUBLICAN- poses as a respec table journal. Where the Alliance is concerned its idea of respectability is queer to say the least. The editor knows that we never drew the two sal aries mentioned. We fail to exactly grasp brother Loucks's point. We understood that last year he drew $1,200 each from the Ruralist and the state Alliance, making 52.400. We also understood that this year the Alliance cut his salary down one-half, and that he magnanimously refused that, for reasons which are very cleverly set both by his Mitchell co-lab orer—without a salary—and printed elsewhere in this paper. The fine dis tinction which Loucks makes between a salary drawn from the state Alliance, made up of dues from the local Allian ces: and a salary drawn from the state Alliance organ, also made up of dues from local Alliances, is hardly percepti ble to any eye but that of a "reformer." Oepew on Harrison. From a recent interview: There is no division of sentiment in the Republi can party in regard to Blaine if he be comes the candidate of the party. Nothing on earth cin prevent his nomi nation if he desires it. If he doesn't, President Harrison will be the nominee. As to the present relations of these two gentlemen I am told that they perfectly understand each other. The idea as fostered by the disappointed office seek ers that President Harrison was a small man mentally and physically, and cold and narrow, became at one time the ac cepted belief of seven-tenths of the American people. While Mr. Harrison did not have this in view in taking his trip across the continent, yet he accom plished the herculean task of talking to the whole people through the Associa ted Press at the places where he stopped from day to day, so that they might know him better. There is no question that he accomplished this task better than anyone has ever done before. The people saw they had been misled, and there was a universal change in public sentiment. A Model Reformer, Here's the way C. W. Hill, one of the loud mouthed haranguers of the party of "reform," tries to sneak out of paying his honest debt, due to the publisher of the essington Springs True Republican: DEARSIR:—Yoursasking for $7.50 for your claim for the Republican is re ceived. Is it not a queer way of doing business for you to do in all your power to prevent ]eople from obtaining reas onable pay for the products of their la bor and then demanding money of them? How do you suppose laboring men are going to get money when they are hin dered from obtaining cost for what they raise. Besides which do you suppose a iierson ought to pay for that which is used to injure and wrong them? Please discontinue the Republican, and in the sometime when we can we will settle up. Respectfully Yours, C. W. 

HILL. Is it not a queer thing for a man to deliberately take a paper four or five years without paying or trying to pay for it In fact, isn't it just a little short of stealing—except that down right theft would be more honorable, there being no false pretense about it. Going to Washington. F. M. Goodykoontz, Esq., passed through to Sioux City. He has just been appointed assistant attorney gener al of the state to go to Washington and protect the interests of the state in the matter of her school and public lands, roads, and Germany, which is pointed I and will leaye for the capital very soon! THE SALARIES THE OBJECT. Boss Loucks's Shrewdness and Mock Self Deuini Cleverly Shown l'|i. Howard Press: According to that Independent sheet published at Mitchell. H. L. Loucks is a schemer too shrewd "for either Moody, Pettigrew the Sioux Falls Press. THE MITCHELL REPUBLICAN, The Howard Press, or Dr. Mayhew's Blade." The Press for one doesn't doubt that H. L. Loucks possesses in almost unlimited quantity the low cunning necessary to the busi ness he is engaged in. In fact it is gen erally acknowledged by the Republicans that Mr. Loucks is one of the slickest adventurers that ever left Canadian soil to fish for suckers within the limits of Uncle Sam's domains. But however sharp Mr. Loucks may be, is not a bit sharp (unless it is a Brutus to the esar of the Alli ance) for in the same article in which it attempts to show what dupes the Re publicans are, it gives Mr. Loucks's lat est trick entirely away and substanti ates just what the Republican press maintains, to-wit: It is the emoluments of office that Mr. Loucks is after. Let the speak for itself. Here is what it says: President Loucks is far seeing as the "ecent Supreme Council at Indianapolis shows. When he refused the salary of the State Alliance, he knew he would be elected vice-president of the na tional organization. His refusing to ac cept a salary as President of the South Dakota Alliance is no defeat, no sacri fice on his part, but a grand victory. He gets a salary as editor of the Rural ist from the Ruralist Co. This position engages his whole time and his salarv is fixed accordingly. What has he lost then by refusing his salary as president of the Alliance of this state On the other hand, he has the honor of be ing re-elected president of the State Alliance, and vice-president of the Na tional organization, and no doubt with a salary attached to his new office. So there was no sacrifice on Loucks's part in declining a salary from the State Alliance' Had there been, of course he would not have released his grip. And then be gets $100 a month from the Ruralist Publishing Co., and although "the position engages his whole time." he gets a salarv as vice president of the "national organization." Thus he receives a salary for which ac cording to the in the very na ture of things, he can not render value received. And then, too, "he knew he would be elected vice-president of the national organization when he refused the salary of the State Alliance." What kind of an oath-bound secret organization is this in which a man (who is in the ring) may know weeks in the future that a convention, composed of dele gates from several states, is going to elect him to a certain lucrative office So the "rings'-are not all within the or ganization of the Republican party, are thev Some Election Figures Considered. The Ruralist prints the following: In an interview with a representa tive of the Southern Alliance Farmer, C. C. Post has this to say: Tn South Dakota the people's party made a gain of at least four thousand votes over that of last fall. The official vote of the late election is at hand, and while there may be some excuse for Post's ignorance, there is none whatever for the Ruralist's dis honesty in disseminating this misstate ment. The Independent vote on con gressman last fall was 24,907, while Smith this year received 14,587 or 10. 320 less than Leavitt had. .Just where the gain of 4,000 comes in is not appar ent to any but a reform mathematician. The Ruralist and other third partv or gans have been trying to bolster up the waning interest of their followers by asserting that, the Independents held their own in the country but that the Republicans were stronger in the towns. A fuller examination of the official fig ures reveals these facts: In Beadle county, where the town of Huron is. the percentage of falling off was about the same in each party. In Brown county, containing Aber deen, the percentage of Republican loss was greater than the Independent. In Codington county, of which \Va tertown is the county seat, the Republi can vote fell off over 50 per cent, while the Independents polled within 30 of their full vote. In Davison county the Republican stay-at-homes in Mitchell made it possi ble for Smith to get a plurality though his vote was over 100 less than that of last year. The Republican vote fell off 274. In Lawrence county, where Deadwood is, the Republican vote fell off nearly one-half, while the Independents lost less than one-third. In Minnehaha county, where Sioux Falls last year cast more than the entire county did this, the Republican vote was nearly two-thirds less while the Independents were a little more than one-third behind. In Yankton county, the town vote did not prevent a falling off of nearly one half of the Republican vote, while about one-fourth of the Independent was missing. Pierre, in Hughes county, helped to rustle out more than one-half of the full vote of last year, while the Independ ents scacrely made a ripple, casting but 69 votes this year as against 399 last. This exception, however, simply proves the rule we have been trying to estab lish. 0* *2 On the other hand, in such counties as Aurora. Brule, Campbell. Charles Mix. Day, Douglas, Hanson and Jerauld.1 the Republicans cast a little more than 50 per cent, of their vote of last year, while the Independents fell off some thing more than half. In Day county, for instance, which has been an Inde pendent stronghold, the Republicans cast 345 votes this year as against 746 last, while the Independents mustered 542 of the 1165 they rolled up in 1S90. or about 45 per cent, in each instance These comparisons have no especial significance in themselves as to the rel ative strength of the parties, but they go to explode the false pretense of the Independent organs that the third party held its strength in the country, and was defeated by the town vote. Had every county in the state showed the same relative percentage that the coun ties containing the chief towns did. Col. •Tolley might be now nursing his wound ed feelings at home, and statesman Smith might be flocking into Jerry Simpson's caucus down at Washington. It was the staunch and true Republi can farmers of the state, therefore, who deserve the honor and credit of Jolley's success while the so-called "town poli ticians," toward whom the hottest third party ammunition is discharged, scarce ly did their full share in the matter. The time has come, too, when the ex citing of prejudice between town and country can no longer succeed, much as third party disturbers and agitators may deplore the clearing away of the factious clouds of difference they have been so zealous in raising. Harrison and BlAine. Gov. Merriam of Minnesota in Min neapolis Journal: Minnesota Republi canism is an aphorism. The state is as reliable today as ever. The Alliance is in a process of disintegration, and in another year will be a thing of the past. Whoever is nominated at the Minnea polis convention will receive the sup port of the entire Northwest and will be elected. Minnesota has for years been a Blaine state, and I suppose that a majority of the Republicans desire to see him nominated. However, the ad ministration has many friends, and I think that Harrison can be easily re elected. Minnesota is opposed to the free coinage of silver, and its congress men will oppose any attempt to degrade the circulating medium of the country. Joel Heatwole, chairman of Minnesota Republican committee, in same: The holding of the Republican convention in Minneapolis is going to be a big thing for the Northwest. While I am in favor of Blaine as the nominee of the party. I think it would be expedient to put Harrison to the front. I know very well that this is an unpopular thing to say in Minnesota, but it will hardly do to throw overboard a man whose admin istration has been admirable, and has in every instance defended the princi ples of the Republican party It is a question with some whether or not Mr. Harrison's overthrow will not make some of the doubtful states still more doubtful, for the conservative people of this country will, after mature reflection, regard the present administration as being a very capable one. Chairman Clarkson has expressed himself very positively on the presi dential question. Coming from one known to be partial to Blaine his words possess much significance. He says: The renomination of Harrison is inev itable. I do not care to explain why I think this, but such is the fact. The course of the administration has not been such, politically, as to please me always—in fact. I in common with other members of the national committee, have often felt agrieved: but it has been the ablest since Lincoln, and this, com bined with other circumstances, and the logic of the situation will make Har rison the next nominee. I think this will be accepted as a fact by all within the next 60 davs. Another Phase of the Question. H. A. Burrell, of the Washington (Iowa) Press, an anti-prohibitionist, re calls how license worked at Washing ton. There, as everywhere, it kept the community in hot water and the saloon thrust itself into every election. Bur rell says, and every one knows his pict ure is according to nature: Let us refer you to your own memo ries of this town before t'ie prohibitory law was enacted. You know and wiil recognize the facts as well as we. You know that ate very spring election this city the whole, the exclusive issue was the tuppeny one "Shall we license saloons?" We pulled and hauled to elect a council with this view or that. No public improvements were made— we were too busy wrangling over the question whether we'd milk a little revenue out of a half dozen or less fel lows who wanted to jerk beer here (and sell whisky on the sly.) Some vears we'd milk'em, some years we wouldn't— it was an eternal seesaw, and everv thing else was neglectod—sewerage, fire enginery, water works, adequate lighting—nothing but pull and haul over license and stinking beer. When we got revenue it did no good—the cost of the devilment of the saloons ate it up. The Press was then for license, and made the best fight it knew how. We own UD to it that we were the biggest jackass in seventeen states. 1 0 Out Here for His Health. J. C. Willitts, auditor of Marshall county, Iowa, and a brother-in-law of J. K.
