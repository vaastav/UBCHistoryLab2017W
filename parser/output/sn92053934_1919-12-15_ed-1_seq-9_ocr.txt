Dave Ferguson ft Co. present an act en titled, "The Rounder On Old Broad way," which Is intended to drive home the moral of "keeping away" from, the bright lights. Despite the Intended seriousness of the act, it is full of good comedy, dished out mainly by Dave Ferguson, himself. Dave describes through the med ium of song the characters one is apt. to meet at night on Broadway. The dope field, the old actor, the girl and the cop, all combine to make the act a more than pleasing one. Jack MacBryde and Marion A. Day offer some clever acting in presenting the "meanest man in the world." His intentions are to show no quarter as success in the col lecting Is to give him the big chance he seeks. When confronted with the fact that it is a beautiful young lady who is the debtor, he extricates himself in resourceful ! EE fashion by borrowing the neces- i sary amount to pay it bfmself and I thus allow the girl the extra time she needs. Rather than being the meanest, he turns out to be about the best man in the world to the girl's way of thinking. Buch broth- rs appear in a bouncing act of ex ceptional merit. The smaller of the pair has a mouth of huge propor tions and turns this fact to good ad- urkntage in producing laughs.
