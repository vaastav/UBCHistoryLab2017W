(arMoncy, Flour and Pork wauled in payment f subscription. The Message and Proclamation. We publish in this issue the third annual mes sage of President Lincoln and also its proclama tory appendix Owing to the fact that the President has been laboring under severe illness for some time past, the writing of tho message was committed to the hands of another, and the result is, tliat, for once, we have some decent English over the signature of Abrabmi Lincoln. The condition of our relations with foreign na nations, is clearly stated and the message proceeds in plain narrative style, until it finds tbo ne gro in its path, when the writer imraodialely falls into the darkest mazes of mystification and sophistry. The argument is made that the eman cipation pr#clamat:ou was a military necessity and in support of it the allegation is made that the "rebel borders are pressed still further back." Now, tiiis is not true as to Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Louisiana. The ground recovered by the Federal armies iu those States, was gain ed before the proclamation was issued. New Orleans, Fort Pulaski, liatteras Island nnd the confederate strongholds in Wfctern Virginia, were captured long before the plighted faith of the President was openly violated. As to Ken tucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mis sissippi, the key to the posession of those States fell into the hands of the Federals when Fort Donelson and Island No 10 were yielded up by the confederates, which events occurred long anterior to tho President's manifesto of emana tion. The fall of Vicksburg and Chattanooga wero but the consequences of the confodera to defeats at Donelson and Island No 10. Tlow, then, has the emancipation proclamation proved a military benefit ? Neither the President nor any of his champions arc able to answer this question. In regard to tho constitutional right of the Exocutive to issue tho emancipation proc lamation, the message admits that no such right exists. Let the reader mark the following pas sage and note how Mr. LincolivktanJs self con demned before the world: "According to our political system, as a mat ter of civil administration, the Government 

IIAT) NO LAWFUI. POWER to effect emancipation in any state." In regard to the so-called proclamation of amnesty appended to the message, wo can but say that if the President fancies that the South ern people will return to their allegiance under the conditions named in that document he must possess a very lively imagination. The idea of requiring them to swear fealty to.every po litical vagary of the Executive, the ctnancipa-' tion proclamation included, and by so doing td yield up their property as well as their civil institutions, is simply preposterous. Had lie only named the terms of submission to the Constitution and laws and an uncondition al pardon, there might have been some hope of their return to the Union. But this proclama tion will serve only to drive the Secession nail deeper into the coffin of Peace and the war will bo continued to an indefinite period. Mr. Lincoln must withdraw the emancipation wedge which he has been driving with his "negro maul" into the very heart of the Union, and, then, (and not till then) there may be somo prospect of peaco and re-union. will be a festival for tho liepefit of the Lutheran Sabbath School, on Christmas eve and Christmas day. On Christmas eve, the Grand Jury room of the Court House will contain tables with the various articles of con tribution for sale. At one ond of the room there will be oysters, Ice-cream and cakes. Christ mas day, at 1 o'clock, P. M., the game-dinner will be given—adults at one table and children at another. The Court room will he used as a reception room till the dinner is ready. The managers prefer selling tickets to all who wish to take dinner before Christmas day. They can be had at the Prothonolary's office, and other places. Wo make this notice at the request of the Festival Committee. •rWe have received several letters congrat ulating us on tho articles against political preach ers which have appeared in the Gaictte. We adk no thanks tor what we have written in this regard. We feel it our duty to oppose the in *oduction of politics into tho pulpit aud. we Intend to fight that dangerous heresy as long as we are able to wield a pen. Political preach eri must be put down. iarWff regret to state that on Saturday last, aliUleson of J. T.

' We iinderstand Ahat the Commistrioner? arc deter taiuod to settle up the old accounts. 1 A Nut for Political_Preaohers. W. H. Chanuing, df Washington City, a 77- mtarian preacher, has been" elected Chaplain to the JTnional House of Representatives, lie. 1 was elected by the Abolition members, the "Dem ocrats voting for Bishop Hopkins of the Ep's copal Church. Now what do the Trinitarian preachers of Abolitionism say to this* They tell us in their doctrinal sermons that U nitar ianism is infidelity and yet the men wlwtn their prayers anJ sermons have helped to i/?nd to Congress, endorse Unitarian ism ami by their example recommend their constitu iiis to do likewise. Have they no tongues to Deprove the wickeduess of their.Congressman in thus ele vating to the sacred desk what they de/.iounce as infidelity? Rev. E. W. Kirby, of the M. E. Church and all other Abolition preachers in Bedford County who hold that it is ii'i accot d ance with the Christian religion to discuss poli tics ill the pulpit, will plousc enlighten their congregations in regard to this TurMter. No dodging, now, gentlemen, but let us know, in plain words, your opinion concerning the elec tion of a Unitarian over a Trinitarian minister as Chaplain to Congress. We Tio.vo often told you that New England is striving to force its religion as well aa its politic* upon the people of the other portions of the Union. You see, now, how this asicßftin is verified. Unitarian ism is the religion of the New England agitators and as they have succeeded in misleading you 'with their Abolition Jack o'tho Lantern, they expect yim also to foil aw their religions Igius fa.tu.vs , Unitarianisuu Abolitionism and infi delity go hand in br.nd. VVbo was Theodore Parker, who are Beecher, Cheever, Greely, Phillips ? Accord rngjto your creeds, in/ lets, ev ery one of them? And yet you, who profess to bo evangelical a. d orthodox, help the agents of these men into place and power, and thus enable them to 'ornaJ down your own religion and set up in Us stead what you t n ll the people is infidelity. Now, pray, be consistent! Either cease to pTe.nch against Unitarianisro, or reprove your friends in Congress for i ndorsing it.— Which will ye do 1 Honor to Salmon P. Chase for the redemp tion of our treasury, moneyless and bottomless when he took it in hand.-J7Aoy Worship's Thanks givirtg Speech. The following comment on the above, is froir the pen of Abraham Lincoln Esq.: "Received, during the year, into the Treasury of the U nited Slates, 

FROM LOANS §770.682,361.57!" (see President's Message). That's the way Salmon P. Chase puts a "bot tom" to the Treasury and prevents it from re maining "moneyless." Let Salmon be honored, because like many other "confidence men," he can borrow ! A third reason for thanksgiving is that Prov idence has called such men to the head of our National and State Governments as Abraham Lincoln and And'w G. Curtin.— Ebony's Thanks giving Speech. Yes, let the Lord be thanked, that whereas under James Buchanan and \Vm. F. Packer, VQJ had peace, plenty and prosperity, una. r Abraham Lincoln and Andrew G. Curtin, we have war, want, misery andcrimo! (j'A supposed horse thief was arrested, on Monday night last, in Cumberland Valley tp.

He is middle nged, about f> feet in height and of athletic frame. He was taken by Mark Howsaro, o.f St. Clair township, and Nicholas Sleek, of Napier township. tyWe suggest the following motto for a preacher who makes politics.' speeches from the pulpit and publishes thorn with out being request ed to do so: "When ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to bo wise."

CANE PRESENTATION.—"VE had tlio plea.-uro of witnessing on Saturday evening last, the presentation of n cane from Hon. Aljrer Strouse to Hon. A. H. CofFroth, of Pensyivama, which took piace at the elegant rooms of Mr. Strouee at Mrs. Pleaaont's on F ntrcot. Tlio cane is a handaomo piece of ebony surmounted with a gold head of American coin standard, with a silver-mounted,-jCsso-hardened steel ferrule— the head soaring£h~e neat inscription ,: M. Strouse to A. IT. Coffroth, 18Gd." The occasion was graced by the pros -nee of a number of distin guished gentlemen; and being a surprise, tho happy allusions of esteem and affection in the speeches were "delicately" appreciated- Mr. Coffroth, in his reception of tlio stick, was for cible, as well in the gracefulness of his attitude and the earnestness of his words, as in the ex treme modesty with which ho acknowledged the compliments of tho donor. The usual inspir ing accompaniments so necessary .to givo ccLnt. to an event like this, were particularly tine, and'with the substantiate indulged in by the compnay produced tho feelings which forbid the the expression "I wish I didn't come."— Wash ington Union.

The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are, or shall have been, civil or diplomatic officers or agentsof the so-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial stations under the United States to aid the rebellion ; all who are, or shall have been, military or naval efficers of said so-called Confederate Government above the rank of colonel in the army, or of lieuten ant in the navy; all who left seatsin the Unit ed States Congress to aid the rebellion ; all who resigned commissions in the army ot r.nvy of the United States, and afterwards akivl the re bellion ; and all who have engaged in t/Sy oth ( er way in treating colored persons or white per ! sons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity.

And it is suggested as not improper, that, in constructing a loyal State government it.' any State, the name of the State, tho boundary, the subdivisions, the con stitution, and the gent'ffd code of laws, us bo fore the rebellion, be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions 1 ..reinbefore stated, and such, oiners, ii any, not contravening said .conditions, and which may be deemed expedient Ny those fram ing the new State government. To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far as' it relates to Stale governments, has no raforenoe U* States wherein loyal State governments have ell tho while been maintained.

And still further, that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the States wherein the national authority has been suspended, and loy al State governments have been subverted, a' mode in and by Which the national authority and loyal State governments may bo re-establish ed within said States, or in any of them : and, while the mode presented is tho best the Execu tive Can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not he understood that nv other possi ble mode would be acceptable.

V., Son of Maj. Daniel Washauaugh, assistant Adjutant general of I'enn., aged about 27 years, lie was Billed by a ball in tlie forehead, whilst heroical ly scaling the walls of fort Wagner. This in formation comes from one of his comrades in arms who a few moments before the fatal ball j struck him received a drink of water from his canteen. His grave though unknown, isnot un wept—His body fills a patriot's gruve and his Spirit a christians and a heaven. The true patriot is the true christian, for ho who is a traitor to his country is a traitor to his Cod. Air. Wnshabaugh was ono among the first to enlist in tho cause of his country. He first entered tho ttireo months' service, after it ex pired, he immediately enlisted again for the war but "lu lias fought his last fight, he sleeps, his sleep, and God's trump shall wake him to an inheritance of brighter glory than earth a.To.als" —"the inheritance incorruptible, undcliled, and that fadeth not away." Gallantly did he on that bloody field uphold the honor of his coun try's flag, and for it lie, with all others who have died like him, will receive the homage of his country's gratitude. .His memory shall ev er be green in the hearts cf mother, father, sis- I ters, brothers, and friends. Nearly five years ago, duringase'ries of meet ings held in the Lutheran church of Bedford, he was awaked and as we believe led to Christ, lie united in that church with God's people and gave evidence in his life, that he desired to a dorn his profession by a consistant walk and conversation. Hie companion in the tent—the Bible, a gift of a devoted sister, was found in his knapsack, showing it was not unused- Tho parents, relations aud friends of our young pa triot hero, need not mourn as those who have no hnpo. Mother, you first gave your son to your God and then to your country'.- care. Your son, brother and friend has fallen in a good cause, fallen as a martyr to the cause of his country. Let us think of him. not as dead but as living ! Living amidst tho pure, peaceful and blissful scenes of Heaven, and waiting to greet us, when our last battle has been fought, and we go up to receive the crown. TEACHER WANTED.
