Tfe Democratic Advocate. WESTMINSTER, MD. B SATURDAY. DECEMBER 7. !!>'.. Democrats, Attention! ■ Pursuant In action of the I>< mocralie Conn ■ ty Central Committee, at a meeting held on H November 27, notice is hereby given that primary meetings will he held at the usual H places, in the respective districts of the conn ■ l ty, on SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7. 1895.

Airy District, from 4 to 5 “ B. F. CROI’SE, Chairman. E. O. We a nt, Secretary. Make No Mistake. Democratic primaries will be held today and a county convention on Monday. It is hoped the party fully realizes the situation and will select delegates in every district who will be able to rise to the import ance of the occasion, lay aside personal friendship, district pride and all other con- I j siderations and act for the general good in j i selecting a candidate for State Senator. The j , party has plenty of material to select from — j t men who would acceptably till il elected. The duty is to select a candidate who can best command tin* party support—a Democrat of high qualifications, of undoubted integrity, and one with no entangling alliances. Such a man is Dr. J. W. Heriug. cashier oi Union National Bank. He is it Democrat from principle, and has been a faithful one for forty years. He has never sought jiolitica! office. He is not now a candidate for the Senate, but leading men in all parts of Car roll have turned to him as the one man in the county surest to lead the party to victory. So earnestly has he been importuned to become a candidate, he has consented to accept a nomination for State Senator if it is offered him with anything like unanimity. It is the opinion of very many persons that Dr. Heriug, at this time, is by far the strongest candidate that could be named, and none will Et) question that there is no better equipped man for the position in the comity. In fact he has few equals, as to fitness and capacity, and should he be sent to the Senate he will be a credit lo the county and a peer of the ablest jncnibers of the Senate. If Dr. Heriug be nominated no mistake will be made. With him as the nominee chances of success will be the best. The Aiivocatc never takes up individuals for local offices. It has been content to ad- i vise good nominations and a strong ticket, j But the present conditions are unusual, and it I feuls it a duty to direct public attention to the | one man in the county who is the surest lo j lead the party to victory. Reed on the Fifty-First Congress. In his speech to the Republican caucus of i the House of Representatives,returning thanks | for liis selection as Speaker of the House, | Thomas B. Reed said—“History will accord I us praise for what we did in the Fifty-first Congress." The Fifty-first Congress, it will be remem bered. was distinguished for Mr. Reed's auto cranc rtmr, nre vomiringol quorums tlmt , not present, the unseating of elected Demo- : erats and the seating of uuclected Republi- j cans, the passage of the McKinley infamy and J the Sherman Silver purchase act, and the ! attempt to pass a Force bill. The first ses- j sion of that Congress ended in October, 1890, j and the following month the congressional elections resulted in changing a Republican j majority of twenty-nine into a Democratic i majority of one hundred and forty. The eon- I 1 I demolition of that Congress was continued iu * the state elections of 1891, and in 1892 the ] country went overwhelmingly Democratic. ; < The more the people contemplated the work of the Ffty-first Congress, and felt the result 1 of the McKinley and Sherman laws, the < greater became their determination to get rid \ of the rule of the party responsible for if. '■ The Democrats repealed both of these * i., . , r measures, ami since have met with two severe * defeats. These defeats, however, were not I the result of dissatisfaction because til' the •' repeal, but because of divisions in the Demo cratie party. Neither of the measures were r issues in the campaign this year. s History will never accord the Fifty-first 11 Congress praise for anything, and if Mr. Reed believes what he said let the present Congress, t under his guidance, re-enact the McKinlyand : t: Sherman laws and attempt the passage of a Force hill. He will witness a condemnation of the Fifty-fourth Congress greater than that visited on the Fifty-first. If Mr. Read does not attempt to repeat the acts that he says history will accord “praise" for, he was talk ing through his hat. Continuing, Mr. Reed said, speaking of history according praise for what the party did in the Fifty-first Congress, “and it may accord ns its praise in this for what we do not do. In this Mr. Reed outlined his policy— i to do as little as possible, adjourn and go j home. He is an aspirant for the Republican ; nomiaation for President, and he is afraid, like all other candidates, that the present ' Congress may by its acts destroy all chances pl success. Every aspirant is nervous on this | account. The Republicans have a majority ; of about IIS in the House, and Mr. Reed will not be able to control it, and it will be dollars : to dimes if the record of this Congress does 1 not ruin Republican prospects. Mr. Cleveland on the Tariff. The President has changed his views of the new tariff bill, after he has observed its prac tical working for fifteen months, and says in his message to Congress that in principle it “is based upon a denial of the right of the Government to obstruct the avenues to our people's cheap living or lessen their comfort and contentment, for the sake of according especial advantages to favorites, and which, while encouraging our intercourse and trade with other nations, recognizes the fact that American self-reliance, thrift and ingenuity can build up our country’s industries and de velop its resources more surely than enervat ing paternalism." 'J he President did not recommend any changes whatever in the law, and evidently believes that it is drawn upon proper princi ples, that it will produce enough revenue to meet the requirements of the government and ought to be let alone. The Sentinel is somewhat outraged that Governor Brown should have designated Dr. Rinehart for Chief Judge of the Orphans' Court. We do not see that it makes any dif ference which one “sits in the middle,” for that, is about all the distinction there is in it The chief has no more pay and no more power or privileges than the other two. If there were any distinction worth noting, it would have only been a graceful compliment for Dr, Rinehart's associates, had they the selection, to have elected Dr. Rinehart. He is the Democratic member of the bench, and the other two are there only because of a light Democratic vote and by aid of some Demo- I .crats who did go the polls. The President’s Message. President Cleveland s third annual message to Congress was submitted on Tuesday. It deals with but two subjects, though it is of the average length. One-half is devoted to our foreign relations, and the other to our finances. Ihe message shows that in international affairs statesmanship and a due regard for the long-established and well-settled policy of this i government and not jingoism has dictated j every act of the State Department. No se rious disputes or questions have arisen be tween the United States and other powers, though the answer to the United States by Great Britain on our position as to the con tention between that country and Venezuela on territorial rights, in which the attitude of the United States is defined, has not been re ceived. Great Britain claims territory that \ enezuela does not concede, and on this point the message says ; “It being apparent that the boundary dis pute between Great Britain and the Republic of Veneznla concerning the limits of British Guiana was approaching an acute stage, a definite statement of the interest and policy of the United States as regards the controver sy seemed to be required both on its own ac count and in view of its relations with the friendly power directly concerned. In July last, therefore, a dispatch was addressed to our Ambassador at London for communica tion to the British Government, in which the attitude of the United States was fully and distinctly set forth. The general conclusions therein reached and formulated are in sub stance that the traditional and established policy of this Government is firmly opposed to a forcible increase by any equivalent power ot its territorial possessions on this continent: that this policy is as well founded in principle as it is strongly supported by numerous pre cedents; that as a consequence the United States is bound to protest against the enlarge- j ment of the area of British Guiana against the will of Venezuela: that, considering the disparity of strength of Great Britain and Venezuela, (lie territorial dispute between them can be reasonably settled only by friend- j ly and impartial arbitration, anil that the j : resort to such arbitration should include the ! whole controversy, and is not satisfied if one ; o( the powers concerned is permitted to draw ' i jf j an arbitrary line through the territory in de . I bate and to declare that it will submit lo ar ! bitration oulv the portion lying one side of it :> In view of these conclusions, the dispatch ii ii ! question called upon the British Government . I lor a definite answer to the question whethet | it would or would not submit the territorial controversy between itself and Veiie/nebi in 1 i its entirety to impartial arbitration." r flic substance of this is, that (treat Britain 1 I or no other foreign power can forcibly en L ‘ I large her territory on this continent. ■ i I pon the matter of finances the message ' i reviews the legislation for tin- past twenty 1 j years: speaks of the raids on the gold reserve, j and the bond issues necessary to preserve it 1 and maintain the public credit as well as the ‘ parity of gold and silver. I’ndcr the present law greenbacks arc redeemable in gold or sil- L ver. and the policy of thegoverment has been 1 to redeem them in either gold or silver, at the ' option of the holder, so as not to discriminate 1 I against either coin and n> preserve their par | ity. The greenbacks amount to about s44ii. - I 000.000, and under a law of 1878 they were not to be cancelled when redeemed, but to be ! reissued and kept in circulation. Since 1879, I the date when the government resumed specie j payments, $1127,000,000 of these notes have j been redeemed in gold, and been reissued, j Thus, nearly the whole greenback debt has j been paid, and yet, under the provisions of ! the law of 1878, tire still owing by the gov- I eminent, ami are ready to do service in de pleting the treasury of its gold. In the lau j gauge of the message, under this law of 1878. j the government has been forced "to redeem I without redemption and to pay without ac- i j quittance." The President's remedy is the retirement I I of the $340,000,000 of greenbacks and the i j $140,000,000 of treasury notes, issued in pay ! meal of silver purchases. Fpon this point he | I says : i [ believe this could be quite readily accom- i I plished by the exchange of these notes for I United States bonds of small as well as large i i denominations, bearing a low rate of interest, i They should be long-term bonds, thus iu- I creasing their desirability as investments, and ! because their payment'could be well post- ! potted to a period far removed from present ' financial burdens and perplexities, when with increased prosperity and resources they would be more easily met. To further insure the cancellation of these notes and also provide away by which gold | may be added to our currency iu lieu of them, a feature iu the plan should be an authorin' 1 given to the Secretary of the Treasury to dis- | pose of the bonds abroad for gold if necessarv i to complete the contemplated redemption anil I cancellation, permitting him to use the pro ceeds of such bonds to take up and cancel j any of the notes that may be in the Treason or that may be received by the Government on any account. The currency withdrawn by the retirement of the United States notes and Treasury notes, amounting to probably less than Sbsc,. 000,001), might be supplied bv such gold as would be used on their retirement or by an ! increase in the circulation of our national i 1 batiks. Though the aggregate capital of those ; now in existence amounts to more than ' $<11)4,000.(100, their outstanding circulation j ' based on bond securitvamounts to only about : * $190.000,000. They arc authorized to issue ; 1 notes amounting to 90 per cent, of the bonds 1 deposited to secure their circulation, but iu I ' no event beyond the amount of their capital ! ! stock, and they are obliged to pay I per cent. ■ ' tax on the circulation they issue. 1 think they should be allowed to issue j circulation equal to the par value of the bonds they deposit to secure it, and that the tax on thuir circulation should be reduced to one- ' fourth of 1 per cent., which would undoubt edly meet all the expense the Government incurs on their account, in addition they should be allowed to substitute and deposit in lieu of the bonds now required as security for their circulation those which would bo issued for the purpose of retiring the Failed States notes and Treasury notes. The banks already existing, if they desired to avail themselves of the provisions of law thus modified, could issue circulation in addi tion to that already outstanding, amounting to $478,000,000, which would nearly or quite , equal the currency proposed to be canceled. | At any rate, 1 should confidently expect to j the existing national hanks or others to be organized avail themselves of the proposed ] encouragements to issue circulation, and j promptly fill any vacuum and supply every I currency need. In recommending the redemption and can , cellatiou of greenbacks the President will be | sustained by the best thought of the conntrv. j I here can be no stability as long as these I notes remain as a menace to the gold reserve, j The treasury has been thrice raided, and it | will be at the mercy of the money sharks so | long as they are required to be reissued after redemption. In fact, under the act of 1878, they are practically irredeemable. The President combats the idea that in creased revenue would cure our financial ills, unless a part of them were paid in gold, and to require this would send gold to a premium and be a discrimination against silver. He goes on further to argue that free and unlim ited coinage of silver, at a ratio of 16 to 1., as advocated by many leading men, would ren der more unstable our currency, instead of improving matters. The message is strong in facts and forcible in argument, but the fear is that partisanship will be stronger than patriotism and no relief will be granted by the present Congress. The Republican party for the past two years has gloated over the financial and industrial ills of the country, which resulted from their pol icy of taxation and finance, and its press and speakers have magnified both. Hard tira es and business and financial depression are usually charged by the people generally to the party in power, and in order to win in the recent elections the party set-up a calamity howl all over the country, it remains to be seen whether the party, now that it controls one branch of the legislative department of government and is numerically the strongest in the other, will apply remedial legislation, or whether it will, in order to win next year, let financial affairs drift from bad to worse and charge it against the Administration. In sending a message to Congress the President performed a constitutional duty. It will have as much influence with a Repub lican Congress as a quire of blank paper would have had. 

FIFTY-FOURTH CONGRESS. 0 Tho Congress Elected Thirteen Months Ago Assembles. e r The sessions of the -74th Congress were be . gun on Monday. Jn the Senate the new j members were sworn in. It being learned that the President's Message would not be sent in until noon Tuesday, the Senate ad journed until that time. 1 In the House Thomas B. Reed, of Maine, i was elected Speaker by a tote of 234. as against 95 for Chas. F. Crisp, of Georgia, the Democratic candidate; 0 for Mr. Bell, of Colorado, the Populist candidate, and 1 for Mr. Culberson, of Texas, Democrat. Mr. Reed, i i taking the chair, made a brief speech, j in which, among other things, he said that those who had acted with wisdom in the past might he fairly expected to act with wisdom in the future. Messrs. McDowell, of Penn sylvania: Russell, of Missouri; Glenn, of New A ork; McElroy, of Ohio, and Couden, of Michigan, were chosen as Clerk, Sergeant-at- Arms, Doorkeeper, Postmaster and Chaplain, respectively. 1 hese were the candidates of the Reed-Quay combine. The rules of the fifty-first Congress (popularly known as the Reed Rules) were adopted for the government of the House in the present Congress, after an assurance from Mr. Cannon, who had offered the resolution, that they would hereafter be referred to the Committee on Rules, and that I lie House would have an opportunity to discuss the report of the committee. After a drawing for scats the House adjourned until Tuesday. , 1 here were 15 new faces among the new senators not counting Chilton, of Texas, who i occupies a seat he once held before, by ap pointment, and there were in addition 13 re- i elected senators. Of the hold-over Senators , whose terms will expire two years hence, i Blackburn. Brice, Hill, Voorhees, Vest, i I ’offer and Gibson, took their scats today with the shadow hanging over them that their t place- may be filled by others when this eon- i gress expires. j Ihe rehabilitated Senate chamber had quite - a changed appearance, due to the rearranging - ol tin; seats of those who remain, and the ab- i seme ot suave and courteous Ransom, of North Carolina, handsome Gen. Butler, of South Carolina, succeeded by Populist Till- ' (l man: Dolph’s flowing whiskers, Mnnderson’s alert face and sonorous voice, \\ ashbnrn s dignified presence and McPherson's matchless I !■- j deportment. f- lu the House of representatives the changes I t. were stili more marked. One feature that u provoked comment was the youthful appear ii attce of many of the new members. Several •r states have sent as representative men who tl are still iu their twenties. Probably two score u ot others are under 40. In point of age the present House is the youngest known to the ~ history of American legislation. Those bov -1 ish appearing member- presented a striking j i'ontrust to their veteran associates, such as i ('fosveiior. of Ohio: ex-Spoaker Oalusha I e j Grow, of Pennsylvania, hale and iieartv. de- j y I spite hi- 70 and odd years: Cultterson. of ' ’ j Texas, now entering upon his eleventh term, j ‘ i and others. e 

MARRIED AT LAST, t ‘ - - | Arthur W. Nyee and Bernard ins i Logsdon, Who Ran Away From Reisterstown Early in the ■ I Fall, Legally Joined in Matrimony. ; Arthur W. Nyee and Bernardiue Logsdon, j ‘ I who eloped last September from Roisters- j 1 ! town, were quietly married in Baltimore on j ‘ ■ Monday. I p to the time of the elopement I ‘ ■ j Nyee lived with his wife and two sons on the j i Reisterstown road, near Garrison, Baltimore j ! i county. Bernardiue Logsdon, the daughter i J jof Squire X. C. Logsdon, of Reisterstown, j 1 ; was employed in the Nyee family as a gover- ! J j ness. Nyee and the governess left, the county j ! I in the early part of September. Subsequently i ‘ ; Mrs. Nyee filed a till! for a divorce in the " i Pircuit ('ourt at Towsosi: and the decree being i " | passed by the court, Beruardine made her ap- j ‘ pearattee again under tlie parental roof at | '* J Reisterstown. She returned home about two j ' | weeks ago. ami until Monday morning lived j " quietly at her father's house. When the !’’ couple eloped they went to Pittsburg. Pa.. | where they took up their abode at a boarding ' house. They contracted a board bill of st;.j. j which they were unable to pay. Nyee was | apprehended, and. being without the neces i stiry funds to pay the debt, was committed to I jatl. Bernardiue. being in liard straits, was anxious to get home, and some charitably j disposed persons procured for her a ticket to i Baltimore. Last week, through the efforts of j a friend ot Nyee in Baltimore. Nyee was re i leasts! from jail. His mother, who lives with j Mrs. Nyee near Garrison, received a letter I from her son while In* was in prison asking ! her to borrow money enough to nay his hoard bill, so that he could be released. The i man's mother made an effort to borrow the i money, but tailed. On Sunday morning last | Nyee appeared at the house where he, his j wife and children had lived. He met his two ! boys iu tli> yard and kissed them. Mrs. I Nyee refused to speak lo him. retiring to her ' room. One of the boarders at the Nyee i house went out on the porch. Nyee wanted | to shake hands with him, but the boarder re- | fused, saying he would rather shake hands : with a dog. He and the boarder bad an I altercation, but Nyce's mother ran out and j tool; her son in the house. On Sunday after- j noon dohii Logsdon, ti brother of Bernardiue, j went to the Nyee house. Nyee said ho i wanted to see Bernardiue, but the boy told I nim he had better tint go to Squire Logsdon's j house, because tin old man said lie would : shoot Nyee. On Monday 7 morning Bernardiue i was driven trom her father's house to Glyndon i Station. Western Maryland Hailtoad. where j she took tin- 9.44 o clock train for Baltimore, j She was accompanied to the station by her | lather, her stepsister. Miss Lou Morrow, and j her tun brothers, John and Wilfred. She i met Nyee in Baltimore. A marriage license ! was procured and the couple were married bv j a minister. Nyee says he and his new wife ! will go to California. Thirty-two Contested Seats. Washington, Dec. 2. —ln view of the un usually large number of contested election . ; cases to be passed upon by the House of Rep i ! resentatives, Speaker Reed has decided to ! appoint two committees to consider them, i | I his i> (lie first lime in the history of Congress ■ I thai the number of contests reached the re | nmrkably high figure of thirty-two. In the < i last Congress there were somewhat more than a dozen, and some of them were not disposed | of until near the close of the Congress. The Committee on Elections will be among the first appointed, and will be instructed lo go i to work and bring in their reports without . delay, if is the intention to have all the con tests disposed of during the first session of the , present Congress. . In ail the contests there is but one in which [j a colored man is a contestant. That is the 1 ease of Murray vs. Elliott, from the Charles ton, S. (’., district. Murrav was the only colored member of the last Congress, and he hopes to be able to unseat Representative Elliott in bis pending contest. Many of the contestants make the fight for the $2,500 ex penses allowed to contestants, providing they are unsuccessful, and it sometimes occurs that the expenses of a contest are not half that amount, but the contestant is thrifty enough to put in a bill for the entire amount.

PANIC AMONG NEGROES. Twelve Deaths From Poisoning or a Mysterious Grip Epidemic. LtTTi.E Roc k, Akk.. December 4. — Further details of the reported wholesale poisoning of negroes near Texarkana was received here today. Up to the present time twelve deaths have occurred, and as many more are in a precarious condition. The negroes of the community are super stitious and ignorant, and do not believe that the deaths are the result of poison or disease, but that it is a pestilence upon them by God. So strong is this belief fastened upon them that they refuse to take medicine, and will not re ceive treatment of any kind at the hands of flic physicians. The doctors say that the deaths are the result of la grippe in virulent form, and that there has been no poisoning. The disease is spreading, and unless the ne groes can be induced to take medicine many more deaths are likely to occur before the epidemic is checked. The theory entertained by some that the negroes have been poisoned is based on the fact that the farmers in that section are in the habit of feeding poisoned slops to their hogs to prevent the negroes from stealing their pork. The case of receiver Stone, of the Central Michigan Savings Bank, which failed in the panic of 1803, against Nelson F. Jennison. a business man of Lansing, Michigan, to re cover a deposit of 

S2BOO withdrawn from the bank on the day of its failure, was decided on Saturday in favor of the defendant. The Judge had charged that if the bank officers knew when the deposit was withdrawn that the hank would fail, then the payment amounted to a preference and could be recovered. Extremely cold weather is reported from Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. On Wed nesday the mercury dropped to 16 above zero 1 in many places.

A proposition to annex to Howard county the portion of Baltimore county that borders the I'a tapseo river, between Marriottsviile and Relay, is lieing discussed, and it is said to lie likely that the Legislature will be asked to consider Hie matter and pass an enabling act. To enlarge Howard county in the manner proposer! would a fleet the first, sec ond and perhaps the thirteenth election districts of Baltimore county, taking a slice oft - the territory contiguous to that county and aflbrding the resi dents of that territory the advantages of a nearby county seat in Eilieott city, which is situated oil both sides of the river, marking the dividing line between the two counties. Residents of Baltimore [ county in that locality are inconvenienced very t considerably in getting to their county seat at Tow • son.
