He is a painter by trade and had worked up a prelt.v fair business in an Iowa town which he was leaving to enlist in the war. One thing he failed to understand: his com petitor In the town where he had his business is a German alien. "That Ger man alien stays at home free from all re-spor-ssbility to enlist or be drafted and takes my l.us.ness while I 50 to war", he i-aid. "Mavbe it is all risht tut 1 don' see it He learned his trade ta ::xs had good wages and is now making money. He's clad to stay at home and let me go 3ght for him whiie he takes my business.

I'd like to see him drafted or sent b*ck to Germany where he belongs instead of grabbing ii?ger wag*s ar.d getting rich while I and the rest of us American boys are fighting to keep the United States on the map of the world."

The children of tha rich and of the poor are as intimately bound together In this country's fiiture as the motor and sensor}- nerves are in their sheaths.

Xot only the very poor but for those whose income is limited and uncertain. Do what you can Individually. Few of us do. Most of us do little and some of us do none. Contribute to the Charity Association freely and willingly. Hunt out the overcoat and clothing outgrown or cast aside but still comfortable and see that it does the work it ought to be doing. Take a little trouble. Don't voice a Phari saical pity. Do business. There is more than one way where in we may be slackers. The commun ity that does not look after its home charities deserves no better term. Yes. the coal goes fast. But sup pose there was no coal In the bin, no food in the house, no shoes or clothiing for the children? Then what would you do? Honestly now, wfcat would you do? FORCING AN INVESTMENT LESSON. Every person who bought a govern ment bond and is able to hold it should keep it both as a good investment and a patriotic duty. In the middle west and we«t buying government bonds is a new investment. Here in this agricultural country in vestment has meant the purchase of ieUiu. When a man A-uved or inherited a reasonable sum he "put it Into land" with the comforting thought that "land doesn't run away or burn up." Land Is attractive also becauee of a certain speculative aspect winch has always giving up her colonies? Will he favor kept its promises. So industrials, bonus giving Trieste to Italy and will he help Japan keep Kiau Chou in China? Will the United States insrist upon-the re turn of Alsace and Lforraine to France? There was a vagueness and diplo matic avoidance of specific statement in the message ttiat keep the diplo mats guessing1 but editorial critics seem to think that it was wise not to involve the people of the various allied nations in a guarrel as to di vision of the spoils of war, at least not until the war has been won. The president's purpose was to ap peal to the people of Germany and Austria to quit their fighting and live by letting others live. At the same time he had to satisfy the feeling hi Russia that wants to bring about a world democracy and he must not say anything that would antagonize or dis hearten the people of Great Rritain and France who are making such a noble fight against the common enemy. For diplomatic reasons he steered in be tween the various conflicting ideas and self interests, and avoided specific statement where it would raise a row at an inopportune time. Because of all the difficulties and the damages involved in a declaration of purpose after the war it is believed that the governments 0/ the entente allies had been consuted as to the pres ident's message and that it carried their official approval before it was is sued. If this is true President Wil son's message to congress is the offi cial statement of entente aims in the war and will stand as such until the fortunes of battle justify a different statement of what the allies purpose to do with Germany when they catch the beast. 

"WHEW. HOW FAST THE COAL GOES." "Whew-w-," said the well-to-do householder, "doesn't this weather take the coal:*' It does. And it takes it faster irr the cheap home than in the J5.000 to $25,000 home. It "takes" everything else that goes to keep people alive in severe weather, food and clothing as it does fuel. Fuel is high, food is high, clothing is high. What isn't high that goes to make people comfortable in cold weather? Stop and figure on it. Put yourself in his place. He has perhaps a family of five to care for, children to clothe and feed and send to school. If he gets 39 cents an hour he works an hour and more for a pound of lard, it ta^es a day out of his labor to buy a pair of cheap shoes for the school boy or the school girl, the rent takes one fourth of his wage. A ton of coal goes in a hurry Just now. He worked two days for it. A sack of flour takes one day's work. Now Just take your pen cil, figure out the man's wage figur ing that he works every working day— which doesn't and can't—and see where you would "get off at." Then suppose that the shop shut down or that you fell sick and couldn't work for two weeks and ran a bill at the -store, or that the mother or children were ill. Figure out some way where in to meet the extra expense and keep square with the world. Every child should be in school Agreed- Every child has a rigty: to a fair chancs in life, to a fair .amoonf mmm and investments of that character have not appealed to the agricultural sc: tions fthe Mississippi valley. The Bankers Magazine fonsees in the emergency sale of government bonds an ultimate effect in the creation of a large permanent class of investors all over the country, not only in gov ernment bonds but in all safe securi ties. "Such a development," con tinues would be regarded as particular ly fortunate" and continues: Mr. Morgan's famous epigram \un digested securities." put in a striking fashion the truth that the banks of the United States sometimes became heav ily loaded with Investment securities. Could the banks pass more of these securities on to their depositors and others, the danger of Indigestion would be reduced by the fact thai the num ber of consumers would be increased and the likelihood of overfeeding cor respondingly reduced. For the domestic and foreign finan cial obligations which the United States must shoulder for some time forward, we shall need an investing public with almost unlimited powers of absorption, and it is well that the pro cess of training such a body 0/ in vestors is now going on and that the educational process is to an extent compulsory— a fact which may be re lit 1 on to speed up the process. That the broadening of the invest ment market resulting from the change referred to may have an important ef frct on the financial and economic status of the United States is reason ably certain. Topics of the Times The wise farmer, seeking help in a time of scarcity, -will remember that if it takes a month to teach a green hand it will be time well spent next spring. Because there's seven months more between the first of April and the last day of November and they are ail busy months. What would Halifax do without the Red Cross? And tije thousands of dead and mangled at Halifax are but a part of those who need the help ful hand of the Red Cross after a battle. As regards the Charity association fund it doesn't matter whether you contribute or "kick in." Everybody's money speaks a universal language to the suffering. "When a man lives In a civilised community he should expect to act like civilised people do and do the things that civilized people are doing. That's the price of living In the midst of civi lization. When that supreme court building is erected, especial attention should be given to the sleeping apartments and baths.

IOWA OUIN'ION AN0 NOTES "It must make drafted boss dizzy to keep track of the numerous orders cdn cernlng them made by the war depart ment," remarks the Traer Star Clip per. "Don't expect engraved testimonials to your loyalty if you go back on your friends to gratify strangers," says the Hampton Chronicle. "Some people are easily flattered by the oily tongue stranger and they fall for his request. They really would prefer to do their friends and i.fighbors the favor, bitt they Just can't stand the pressure of the stranger who is paid to "work" them The Sigourney Review says "if any one believes that the country is being depleted of farmers on account of .the war let him go out and try to rent a farm and he will find that there is a half doxen other fellows looking at the same farm." The Rolfe Arrow suggests that the dags are not observing the law against killing sheep, and the "possibly a con stitutional amendment will stop them. Loot's have a vote on it-" "Yes," re plies the Knoxville Express, "and tf the dogs do the voting it will fail to pass. However, we haven't heard any thing of the dogs agitating against tho law on the ground that personal liber ty is taken away from- them. The brewers and distillers haven't called it to the dog's attention dogs don't drink anyhow." "If General Byng was able to brea« the vaunted Hundenburg line with his tired veterans, what will a million or two of fresh, eager American boys do to that line next summer?" Inquires the Manchester Press. Remarking that the Des 'Moines Tri bune -would have bootleggers shot who sneak liquor into the army camps, the Iowa City Republican says: "But why shoot only these who supply soldiers* We think a bootlegger ought to be shot on general principles." Iowa Newspapers MORE ABOUT ST KIN ER. [Des Moinee Capital.] Dr. Edward A. Steiner. a professor at Grinnell College, complalps that the Capital has done him an Injustice. He again declares his patriotism. We have no objection to his patriotic declara tions but we discover In his own statement of what he claims to hava said that he is an apologist for Ger many. In order to get at the situation and, in a measure, to defend Germany, he puts up Germany's faults and names ours also. This Is the fashion able way with many whom we call pro-German. When on* talks to them about the fearfljl Prussian atrocities in Belgium they dismiss it all by saying' "Well war Is war." This appears to be the plan of Dr. Steiner. We are willing he should confess for Germany and Austria. Their crimes are many, but we do not want the crimes in Belgium to be dismissed by any reference to American commercialism nor by any reference to the Bank of Kngland. The following letter testifies to the doctor's honesty also ,to his »uileness. He is foolish enough to think that nobody wuld catch on to his comparison of offences between Germany, Great Bri tain and the United States. This letter from Dr. Steiner has been in the possession of the Capital several days, but at a hasty glance It was discovered that the letter was not signed, and the embossed name of the doctor on the sheet of paper was not discovered until HewRV* You GST YOUASACP owe OP S*esS SU«TS THAT out) o*j€ 00 "TeRK«rE UPw? enHttsf prtojta# aal frtatdl daftly. drtuasll lowm Mav. it, 1117.—OMItor of tha Capital: At tha atoaa ot a baautlful but sad Thankagtrlng day, my attsntloa was oallsd to your editor ial In which you question my patriot ism. You are perfectly correct in aaylng that 1 did not mention all ths oau which led us Into this unfortunate but necessary war. In fact I did not men tion any of. the pauses, for I was not speaking about the war, but how trie Christian man, (and I was speaking before a church club), should cultivate his life at a time like this. I mentioned the following some of them trite enough. Faith In God, when it is diffi cult to have faith prayer when it is hard to pray and a feeling of com passion for ths people of other nation alities who are our neighbors, and to whom this war Is a double Gethsemane. I did not speak of my relatives but, as It Happens, one of them, my own broth er, tho a native of Austria, has been so loyal to the United States-that I re ceived a letter from the secretary ot the American legation to Vienna, which contains the following words: "Your brother's services'' have been invaluable to us, and I know that if he "were living in America he would be as loyal a citizen as I know you are." Moreover, I have a letter forwarded to me thru the legation .received only a few weeks ago, in which my brother notifies me that he is living In Switzer land, and from there is aiding as far as he can, the cause of the United States. What his services are I do not know but I am proud of the fact that he is pro-American and evidently exiled, and that Is due to his visit with me about four years ago, when it was my privilege to Initiate him Into Amer ican life. As to my address at Marengo, what the papers in Marengo quote is correct only they do not quote It all. At your request some weeks ago, I supplied the missing sentence, which gives the mat ter quite a different aspect but you were evidently either not generous enough to write that 1n to your accus ing editorial, or you did not believe me. For the benefit of your readers I will supply the missing link. This is what I said: "You can not build your civilization upon an unrestrained militarism, neither can you build it on an unre strained commercialism. Neither tPots dam, nor the Bank of 'England, nor Wall street are safe foundations. There is only one foundation, and that has een laid la the tragedy of Calvary.' ir this is seditious or, a half-hearted patriotism, it -must stand, and I will take the consequences. It Is vour especial task to arouse the nation to the danger without, and you are doing it with fervour. If not always with wisdom it is mine to point out ths danger within, if we fight this war upon a lower level than that announced by -President "Wilson in his memorable and epoch-making speech. I am not trying to shield myself, nor my 1 relatives In Europe. I am, as far as I can, sharing In the sacrifices made, and if my country calls for my last penny and my last drop of blood It can have it. One thing 1 will not do and can not do. I will not by word or deed Increase the hate which Is in tho world. 1 can not so amend my patriot ism that It will nullify my Christian ity. My floul is still my own and my Gods but money and my body my country can claim it any tlms. Very sincerely yours, Edward A. Steiner. We ask the readers to analyse the following sentence which appears in the above letter, on which the doctor rests his case: You can/not build your civilisation upon unrestrained militarism." (This is tha charge aaglnst Germany), 'neither can you build It upon unre strained commsrclallam" (which is tho charge made in Germany against tho United Staes.) He pits one of theso crimes against the other. Then he says Neither Potsdam (the headquarters of the kaiser, the same kaiser who !s never criticised for rapes and murders in Belgium), nor the Bank of England, nor Wall street, are safe foundations." Thus he attempts to off-ast the crimes of Prussia by ths so-called commercialism, of the Bank of Eng land. and the commercial transactions of Wall street Then he says: "There is only one safe foundation and that has been laid In the tragedy of Cal vary." These lhst words make the In dictment stronger aaglnst the doctor. He groups all offenses of the nation on an equality and emphasizes that by a reference to the crucifixion.

But one day when Uncle Lucky was out riding with his little rabbit nephew they came across a tremendous great drift Why, the snow was piled almost as high as the old pine tree where Prof. Crow had his home, and the Lucky. snowbUe began to balk. Just like a horse, you know. It stood up on ita hind runners and pawed the air with the .lKtle front red sleds, and then it stood on them and kicked the hind sleds out, one, two, three, bang! And. of course, Uncle Lucky didn't know what was the matter, and neither did Billy Bunny, and neither did I until a utterances we declare his speech to be unpatriotic. It sends every man away from his meeting with the utterances that "We are all poor sinners God have mercy on all of us." Thus we are put on an equality with the German atrocities and the starvations which Germany has put upon the helpless people of the smaller countries. Dr. Steiner, in an effort to dis:uss the Christian aspect of the war, groups all the offenders together and he con coals his confession on behalf of Ger many by referring to "Potsdam" which thousands of readers would not know or understand as the home of the kaiser. GOVERNOR HARDING'S FttCfURiM.' flDcs (Moines Register.] To the (Editor: Last Sunday's Reg ister contained the following state ment: 'It was the prediction of Governor W. L. (Harding that the state treasury would be Jd.MO.OOO behind July 1. 1917. The governor didn't miss it far,' said Savage. There was some money In the treasury but there were a lot of unpaid warrants.'" The balance in the general revenue of the state at the close of business June 30. 1*17, was I84«.«42.65. The state warrants outstanding amounted to W38.670.82. The actual balance in this fund, less warrants outstanding, was 1508^71.53. If the statement was given out ta this form it would be -no more misleading than the published statement. The facts are, that there was at that date credited to the auto fund the sum or 4M3,S10. and to the credit of the fish and game fund the sum of 102. 2S0. Taking into account these two Items, the general revenue of the state was overdrawn July 1, 1917, X»#,7W^5.
