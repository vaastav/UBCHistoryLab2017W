MONDAY EVENING. DEC. 12. IS98 For hkk own reputation the South may be chat no Southern man was a member of the co-called peace commis? sion, the members of which disgraced themselves and brought ridicule upon the whole country by allowing a public show to be made of the consummation of the peace treaty, and permitting their underlings to hand them pens with which to sign that treaty, and then grab and hold them for sou? venirs, probably to be sold to people in this country with more money tbnn brains._. As anticipated, Mr. Bailey's reso? lution, reiteratiug the fundamental democratic doctrine that a majority shall rule, was adopted by the demo? cratic members of the U. S. House of Representatives at their caucus last Saturday night. Mr. Cleveland and all the other so-called democrats who re? pudiated that doctrine bave come to well merited grief. A mau who thinks he knows better than two-thirds of all the re3t of his party should not call himself a democrat. Then, too, there is bibli? cal authority against a man's placing too much reliance on bis own opinion. If the Presideut can send half a dozen members of Congress out of the eountry, he cue, if it shall please him to do so, send fifty; and if he cato send them out at one time, he can do so at all times, so that he has it in his power, at his pleasure, to destroy any majority against any of his pet measures there aiay be in Congress, and be. therefore, have sole legislative, as well as execu? tive, authority. This, however, is no', strange, as under an imperial govern ment one man must rule. Another U. S. battleship, the Mas? sachusetts, ha; been badly damaged, aud that, too, in sailiau out of the New York harbor, and in the day time. In the lace of so many accidents to ship in the American navy, it is not at all strange that the American government should refuse to submit the Maine affair to the arbitrament of an international ?>oard of examiners. Mr. Watterson, who ones though: it was wrong for the United States gov ernment to seize and hold territory in the South, now thinks it is right for that government to seize territory ten thousand miles away that belorjgs to foreign governments. But Mr. Watter son thought one hundred thou.-ami unarmed men could install Mr. Tilde? as President, and he also followed Mr. Cleveland out of the democratic party. It is annouueed (bat Mr. Wtn. j. Bryan either has resigned or will re? sign his commission in the army. Mr. Bryan made the grand mistake of hid life when he sought that commission. There was nothing for him to gain by doing so, but much to lose, as he ha? doubtless already discovered, or, if cot, will certainly do so. The almanac of the Philadelphia Record l'or 1899 is the first to appear of the several newspapers that issue such annual publications. Like most of the things that come out of the Record of? fice, it is excellent in each and all of it many parts.

Notwithstanding all the ?ab in the m wspapers of this city, all of which are now regarded as republican, the demo? cratic caucus held last Saturday night was of the tamest possible character Nearly ninety democratic members were present and Mr. Bailey's resolu? tion to the effect t hat the action of two thirds of the caucus should be binding upon the other third was passed with? out any trouble and with only about a dozen voting against it. The President sent a few uniinport nut nominations and some of the same sort of promotions in the army to the Senate to-day. To-day was devoted by the House to the consideration of bills in relation to the District of Columbia.

TREATY OF PEACE SIGNED. ' The treaty of peace between 1 Spain and the Uuited States was signed ! in Paris at8:45 Saturday night. Around the great mahogany table in , the foreign office sat the ten arbiters. ] Ranged binding behind them were j numerous attaches of the American ; commission. To the Americans it was a happy j ending of the epilogue of war; for the Spaniards it was plainly a bitter tragedy, j none the less painful because long fore? seen. They sat silently as though al? most crushed, and none could withhold sympathy from Senor Montero Rio*, the president of the Spanish commis? sion, who, coming from his bed, was bundled in a great overcoat, although logs were burning in the fire-place nearby. The spirits of the two bodies were symbolized by the clothes worn by the members of the commissions, for the Americans were attired in evening dress for the dinner given them immediately after the meeting by the Due de Lou bat, and the Spaniards wore black frock coats. Although the commissioners met at half paar 3 o'clock expecting to finish their work in half an hour, the engross? ing of the treaty on parchment was found to be so troublesome that it de? layed the signing of the document until S:10. When Clerk Martin, of the Ameri? can commission, came into the chamber ,at 7:30 with the document he found the commissioners waiting. The Spanish copy had arrived a half hour earlier. Mr. Arthur Ferguson then proceeded to read first the English and after that the Spauish version of the treaty. This finished, two copies were passed around the table, the commissioners signing them in the order of their rank: Win. R. Day, Senator Cushman K. Davis, Senator William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid and Senator George Gray, Senor Montero Rios, Senor Abrazuza, Senor Garnica, Senor Villauruiiaaud General Cererory Saons, each commissioner signing its opponent's treaty. Both were tied with the Spanish and American colors. When the seals were prepared to be affixed, attendants were sent scurrying for ribbons of the French tri-color with which the documents were sealed as a compliment to the French hosts of the commissions. The last seal being impressed, the commissioners arose and without for? mality each member shook the hands of all his antagonists and exchanged as? surances of sincere personal esteem. The Spaniards afterward commented acridly upon what they termed the bad taste of the Americans in mustering a crowd of attaches to gloat over the consummation of their downfall and to scramble for relics. The signing was finished at 8:45. At that time the door of the chamber opened and Senor Villaurutia appeared and exclaimed to a group of correspon? dents who were waiting in the corridor "C'est fioi." The other members ol the Spanish commission followed Senor Villarutia and passed silently through the vestibule to the waiting carriages. The American commission strolled out chatting complacently and as they de? scended the steps the lights in the chamber were darkened. The treaty signed consisted of seven teen articles, it having been found ad? visable to subdivide two or three of the articles in the draft agreed upon at the last meeting. The commissioners of the two nations wrote their signatures on two copies ol the treaty, one copy being for the arch? ives. The document was prepared by-Sec? retary Moore, in behaif of the United States commission, and by Senor Villau? rutia for Spain, on account of the con? tinued illness of Secretary Ojeda, of the Spanish commission. Each copy contained the English and Spanish texts of the treaty in par alleled columns. The wording had been approved previously by the com? missions without a joint meeting, so there was no controversy on this sub? ject. There has been a great contest among the families and friends of the Ameri? can commissioners for possession of the pens with which the signatures of the treaty were written. Some of the Americans were provided with hand? some pens purchased for the purpose. The Spaniards appeared to he unaffect? ed by the souvenir craze and contented themselves with ordinary quill pens strewn on the table. Just prior to the final reading of tho treaty the commissioners were photo? graphed. The official news of the signing of the peace treaty was received in Washing? ton a little later than the press reports. It was in cipher form as usual from Judge Day. It was at once transmit? ted to the President who was aloue at the time, but within a comparatively short time all the members of the Cabinet had either called or sent their congratulations. The President's con? gratulations were promptly cabled to the commission, but the news of the sign? ing having been so thoroughly dis? counted in advance, the actual receipt of the official advices created little stir. Further details have been learned at Wasbiygton as to the wording of the treaty, which provideOhat Cuba is to be relinquished, and that Porto Rico and the Philippines are to be ceded. The Americans are to pay for the re? patriation of all the Spanish troops from all the colonies. The Spaniards are to return all prisoners held by them. They are to retain possession of all military stores and munitions of war in the Philippines, and of such ships as have not been captured. I The commercial treaties between the two nations, which the war ruptured, are to be renewed at the convenience of the two nation,;. The protocol makes nearly si^c hun? dred typewritten pages. The United States commissioners have been almost overwhelmed with offers of dinners in England, prompted by the desire of prominent Englishmen to emphasize the Anglo-American en? tente, but they will remain in Paris un? til the day before sailing for the United States. They will make formal calls upon President Faure and high officials in Paris, to thank them for official hos? pitality. Unofficial hospitality to the Uuited States commissioners has been ostentatiously lacking in Paris. Spanish Pbotks'i'.?-The memoran? dum of protest presented to the Aiaeri can Peace Commissioners by Senor J RioS objects to th9 refusaljof the Amer? icans to surrender the securities de? posited in the treasuries of Cuba and Porto Bioo by private Spaniards, re? marking that Mnevpr has a civilized nation committed such an act of vio? lence." Secondly?It protests against the ul? timatum demanding the Philippines. Thirdly?It protests against the po? sition in which those Spaniards are place who desire to remain in Cuba. Fourthly?It. protests against the reference to the destruction of the Maine in President McKinley's messnge to the United Suites Congress. On this point the memorandum says : "Spain has proposed arbitration, but the United States refused to give her the right which is granted to a oriminal, namely, the right of defending himself. The Spanish cotnmissioi.ers leave the care of fixing the responsibility for the explo sion to tho entire world, which will say whether those are responsible who de? sire the truth, or those refusing to seek it."

DEATH OF GENERAL GARCIA. General Calixto Garcia, the Cuban war or and leader, and head of the com? mission elected by the Cuban Assembly to visit this country, died in Washing? ton yesterday morning shortly after ten o clock at the Hotel Raleigh, where the commission has its headquarters. The sudden change from the warm climate of Cuba, with the hardships ha had there endured, added to the wintry weather of New York and Washington, is responsible for the pneumonia which resulted in his demise. He contracted a slight cold in New York, which did not assume an alarming stage until the early part of last week. On Tuesday night General Garcia, in company with the other members of the commission, attended a dinner given in his honor by General Miles, and it was the result of the exposure that night which culmi? nated in his death. As soon as the death became known a uumberof visit? ors, including many public men, went to the hotel to express theircondolence. President McKinley manifested his sympathy by sending a suitably word? ed letter, and Vice President Hobart sent his card. General Garcia left a large family, only one of whom, Justo, a captain on his staff, was with him when he died. His widow, and Mercedes, a daughter, seventeen years of age, are at Thomae ville, Ga., where the girl is quite ill; Mario, a son, nineteen years of age, is with the mother at Tbomasville, and Colonel Carlos Garcia, another son, is in ^uba. A daughter, Leooore, who married an American, is now living in Paris. General Garcia's mother is still alive and resides in Havana. The death of General Calixto Garcia leaves General Maximo Gomez the sole survivor of the three great leaders of the long Cuban struggle for indepen? dence. General Garcia had a most ac I tive and yaried lifo, much of which had been spent in fighting for the cause of Cuban liberty. He wa3 a man of cul? ture and refinement, of splendid edu? cation, and came from a distinguished family of Jiguani, of Santiago de Cuba province. He was born in Holguin, October 14, 1839, and was, therefore, in his sixty-first year of his age. General .Garcia was educated in Havana and Spain. In 1864 he was married to Isa Velez. General Garcia was the original cdr:=oirator in ,tbe u??3jaZ ?j the Cubans against g;;*ln 10 1868, and in that war, under Gomez, attained toe rank of a brigadier general. The funeral of Genercl Garcia will take place at 10 o'clock to-morrow from St. Patrick's Church. Cardinal Gib? bons is.expected to officiate?

Washington, December 12. SENATE. Resolutions of the chamber of com j merca of Charleston, S. C, were pre | sented in the Senate io-day warmly en j dor-iog that portion of t?e President's j message recommending the appoint? ment of a sanitary commission to inves? tigate the yellow fever question, and urging the South Carolina Congressmen to support a bill therefor. Senator Hoar introduced a resolu? tion to day providing for a joint Cod gi essiorjal committee to consider mat? ters relating to the centennial celebra? tion to be held in Washington in 1900. Mr. Yt.st then look the floor to argue his auti-expausiOD resolutions offered last weak. He .said he did not propose to discuss any treaty questions. It wss not bid purpose to say things that ought not to bd said in an open session of the Senate. Ti.e Missouri staj.es mau wasiu good voice and hisass o atts in the chamber settled down in their seats evidently expecting an interest? ing speech. The first fifteen minutes of his speech was devottd to constitution? al arguments, and then he vigorously asserted that only within the last six months had this "expansion craze" neized the people. He insisted that prior to that time, there was not a man of material importance in the Unites States who favored colonial possessio! 8. Every tribunal, since this coun? try had shuken oil the British yoke, had been against the policy. Jilr. Vest opposed the idea of taking under the jurisdiction of the United St&ics millions of acres of foreign soil aud millions of foreigu people. He then proceeded to argue that these uew propositions clashed with the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution and urged Senators to adhere strictly to the principles of the constitution. He referred sarcasti? cally to the attacks public men were subjected to if tboy did not fall in line .?itn the new ideas and indorse the hateful colonial system of Europe. He freely quoted Thomas Jefferson aud referred to the organization of Louisiana and Florida as territories, and the bringing of all our earlier acquisi? tions in as territories under the jurisdic? tion of the United States. It was the same with Alaska. j| Odo of Mr. Vest's most solemn and interested listeners wa3 Mr. Hale, of Maine, who is an ardent anti-expan? sionist and who is meeting with some opposition in his contest for re election, according to late advices from the capi? tal of bis State.

Mr. Morgan then commenced his speech in favor of the bill and will probably consumed the remainder of to-day's session.
