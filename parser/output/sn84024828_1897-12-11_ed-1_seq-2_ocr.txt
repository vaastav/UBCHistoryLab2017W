IWAIIAWW riSMa SUBSCRIPTION RATES One year, 4$; Six Months, 2$ It is reported that 100,000 people will go into Alaska next spring and summer. Smallpox is epidemic in San Marcial, New Mexico, but so far only one death is reported. The Nogales Oasis is now the best weekly paper published in Arizona and Editor Bird Bhould feel supremely happy. Two thousand prospectors have left Dawson for Fort Yukon and other places on the Yukon river where the food supply is sufficient to carry them through the long winter. Yavapai county had two mur ders this week. "One of the mur derers, at least, should have been executed first and had his trial af terward. The murder was a most cold-blooded one. Judge Sloan has decided that the Wolfley claim against the territory for 7,500$ is a valid one. Tho Board of Control audited the claim for 3,500$ and tho Prescott Courier cried fraud, boodle, etc. Now that over 9,000$ will have to bo paid by order of court the Courier says never a word. Keports continue to como from the Yaqui country and they are not of a nature to cause the whole country to rise up as one man and flock there. Gold is found along the river and the ravines debouch ing into it, but not of sufficient richness to be worked profitably. Arizona is today tho best country on the globe for miner and prospector. Jerome Booth is now editor of the Needles Eve. Mr. Booth is a Needles boy and we hope the peo ple will give him a liberal patron age and feel ass ired that his work on tho Eye will be for Needles' good. Arizona loan commissioners have floated the new five per cent bonds to the amount of 258,000$. This completes the funding of Arizona's indebtedness and will save the tax payers many thousands of dollars yearly. In Fall River, Massachusettes, the cotton manufacturers' associa tion has decided to make a ten per cent cut in employes wages, to take effect January first. It effects 28, 000 employes with a weekly pay roll of 180,000?. The president has appointed j Blanche tv. liruce to be register ot the treasury. Dear reader, Blanche is not a lovely female as you may suppose, but a male negro from Mississippi, who during reconstruc tion days was a member of Con gress from that state. Tho miners of California are pre paring a unique invitation to Pres ident McKinley to attend the min ers golden jubilee next year. The invitation will be on a polished piece of quartz plentifully sprinkled with gold. It will be one of the most beautiful quartz specimens to be found in the state. Mohave county ships yearly to the Colorado smelters 1,000,000$ in silver and gold besides hundreds of tons of rich lead and copper. This great product goes to swell Colo rado's output of mineral Undoubt edly the other counties of Arizona ship to the smelters enough to make the total over 2,000,000$. President McKinley submitted Irs annual message to Congress Monday. It deals largely with Cu ban, Hawaiian, and monetary af fairs. The president urges the im mediate annexation of Hawaii and contra that Cuba be turned over to the tender mercies of Spain. We are at a loss to know hov the pres ident arrived at the conclusion he has regarding the two applicants for onr protection. Hawaii is 1000 miles off our westernmost coast while Cuba is almost a stone's throw from the coast of Florida. Annexation is not asked for Cubaj simply that it be given belligerous rights. Regarding monetary affairs the president assumes that all our obligations are payable in gold This is the same policy that Grover Cleveland carried out. It is Gage's policy and it will continue to be the policy of every president domi nated by eastern influences. He refers to the incomplete work of the international monetary commission and hopes that in the end it will succeed in establishing a double standard. France received hearty thanks for assistance rendered our commissioners and for the apparent willingness to agree to open the mints to the free and unlimited coinage of silver. The message con tains 13,00(1 words, but as a state document cannot be said to be above the ordinary. Quick ? The sooner you begin t6 use Schilling's Best tea and baking powder, the better your opportunity to get some of that $2000.00. And the more you w 11 en joy your cake and eating. A Santa Rosa, Calif., man writes from Dawson City that he is pay ing 300? per month for board in a private family. That is not exces sive. Twenty years ago it cost miners in Mohave county 100? per month for grub and they had to do their own cooking, washing and ironing, besides furnishing their own rooms and bedding. Congressman Hartmn, of Mon tana, takes issue with Senator Car ter, of the same state, who pro possed that legislation doing away with all paper money below the denomination of 10$, in order to in crease tho use of silver, be adopted at this session of Congress, and gives notices that the silver repun licans will not accept that or any other compromise of the silver question. Mr. Hartman also ex presses his opinion of Senator Chandler and other republicans, who, ho says, ''still proposes to chase the will-of-the-wisp of inter national bimetallism, in spite of the knock-out blow dealt to it by Lord Salisbury in his reply to the proposals of Senator Wolcott's com- A Schilling ft.
