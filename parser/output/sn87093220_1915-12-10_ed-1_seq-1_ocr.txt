TWENTY-NINTH Y2AR STORES FIND CHRISTMAS TRADE BRISK Season This Year Is Al ready Much Better Than Last Year SHOPPERS WAKE UP Real ize It Behooves Them to Start Now to Buy Early WHETHER February is to see the return of good times, as confidently predicted by many lum ber manufacturers, or whether the signs of dawning prosperity mean that it will arrive in full blast some time next spring, one tiling is evident in Aberdeen, and that is that this Christ mas season is to be a far better one than last year's. Some cynics still may dispute the assertions of Grays Harbor lumber men who declare that 1910 is to be the brat year for the industry in the past five years; but none may contra dict the evidence put forth by the shopping crowds in Aberdeen stores. They are buying. Most of them en- " u - stores with that purpose. Those that come in "to look around," end by purchasing Christmas gifts. The Christmas season this year started several days in advance of its wont, says George J. Wolff. "We us ually look for tlie buying of holiday t-Towds to start about December 10," observed Mr. Wolff lust evening. '"I his year is different. The Christmas buy ing was on in my store, in full blast, last week. So great, and at the same time bo unexpected, was tlie rush, that 1 was compelled to wire for some stocks out of which the crowd clean ed me. "One fact should be borne in mind by the Christmas shopping public this year," continued the big dry goods merchant, "and they will be uved some disappointments. We can't get large quantities of many things in the holiday stories of which, in previous years, we have been well supplied. Possibly a knowledge of that fact, on the part of the early Christmas shoppers we are seeing this year, may account for their flocking in last week and this." Another gratifying feature of the Yule tide trade commented upon by Mr. Wolff was the briskness with which the toy furniture, made by the Aberdeen Manufacturing company and carried by Wolff's establishment, was moving. McNEILL KEEPS ON COMMISSION A. C. McNeill of Montesano is re flected to his place on the Grays Har bor port commission, at last Saturday's election. His majority over his only opponent, A. i>. Callow of Elma, was about 300. In the precincts McNeill received 1,778 votes, Callow 1,417. The few precincts whose judges neglected to send tallies other than those with in ihe sealed envelopes can affect the result but little.

THE ABERDEEN HERALD FOWLER TANGLE WITH CITY ENDS Council Make New Con tract for West Bridge Repairs TANGLES over the city's contract with Engineer Charles Fowler of Seattle for the latter's supervision of repairs to the West bridge; were straightened ont at Wednesday night's council session. Fowler agreed to do the work for $1,600, provided' that the material to be sent by the Toledo Bridge company shall arrive by Janu ary 15. Should the material not reach Aberdeen until later than that date Fowler is to be paid the penalties to be exacted from the Toledo concern, up to $200. The council instructed the city attor ney to draw up an ordinance accept ing the offer from George Tilden & Co. to pay a premium of $200 for the $200,i)00 of Wishkah water project bonds yet undelivered. Following Councilman Kmpcy's motion to this effect, some opposition developed on the part of a few eouncilmen who believed that the city should hold the bonds until August,' the date originally set for delivery. W. .1. Patterson told the council that, in his opinion, the full $400,000, and possibly more, would be required for Ihe finishing of the project.

Opening of Shafer Bowling Alleys Big Event for Harbor The opening of the Shafer Bowling and Billiard parlors, In the Living ston building, Wednesday evening, was an event unique in Aberdeen: unique, for that matter, in the West. There is no other establishment of the kind on the Pacific Coast. Ejaculations from the crowd that passed up the stairs at 7 o'clock, the opening hour, testified to the com pleteness of the surprise which Mr. Shafer had sprung on Grays Harbor. The parlors looked more like a very handsomely furnished club than a business establishment. A reading room, fitted with heavy library table and fine lounging chairs, in the north west corner of the parlors, accen tuates the club effect. Within a few minutes of the open ing of doors the crowd, with the pret ty costumes of many ladies in evidence, : was spread around the rooms, listen ing to the strains of the music, fur -1 nished by the Aberdeen band, watch ing the play at the dozen pool and billiard tables or. seated in opera chairs on a raised platform, taking in ' the bowling on the six alleys. To re peat: there has been no similar sight or event on Grays Harbor; and it could not have been duplicated in the West. That Mr. Shafer had expend ed some $15,000 in the furnishings land equipment is no matter for mar vel; rather, the wonder is that the 'effect was procured for that sum. j There are a dozen pool and billiard tables in the parlors, and they were all busy on the opening night, as were , the six alleys. The floor space of , 100 by 130 feet does not seem at all crowded, either. This afternoon should see a gather ing of ladies at Mr. Shafer's estab lishment. From 2 to 4 o'clock three 'of the alleys will be open to them, free, for practice; and on every Fri -1 day afternoon thereafter. CHECK BAGGAGE DIRECT TO HOUSE Arrangements are to be made im mediately by the Northern Pacific railway, for checking of baggage from Hoquiam and Aberdeen to depots, ho tels or residences in Portland, Taco ma, Seattle and Spokane, also from those cities to hotels and residences in Aberdeen and Hoquiam. This mat ter, says E. A. McKenna, general agent, has been under consideration for some time and the details are now being worked out, but the ar | rangement will go into effect within a very few days. A. V. Reinboth of Amboy. 111., for merly a resident of Aberdeen, was in the city this week for a short visit and to look after his property inter ests here.

FRED SCHARFE DIES IN SEATTLEi "Count" Remembered Here Succumbs to In jury from Fall WITH the death, Monday, in a Seattle hospital, of Fred Scharfe, many Aberdeen people will recall the eocentricities of the man who became known, here as in Se attle, as "The Count," a year er bo ago. Scharfe died as the result of a fall, last Sunday, from a Seattle apart ment house window to the pavement 50 feet below. During his six months' residence in this city, Scharfe was divided be tween two ambitions: to obtain a po sition as German instructor in the high school, and to induce some act ress to accept his attentions, indicat ed by the sending of bouquets to prac tically every stage favorite who play ed at the Grand. After he had cut out from magazines in the local Car negie library some pictures of actress es the police, without arresting "The Count," persuaded him to move on to Seattle. Within the past few months Scharfe had nursed stage ambitions for him self and had sung at several amateur nights at motion picture houses, lie claimed to have been, at one time, a lieutenant in the German army. * PRETTY JAP BABY BORN ❖ ❖ ❖ •> Women of South Bend are mak- <• ❖ ing much of the birth of a Japan- •> ❖ ese girl baby, the other day, at ♦> ❖ the South Bend General hospital. ❖ "Pretty as a picture!" they rhap- •> ❖ sodize when they see the little <* ❖ 6i/£-pound daughter of Mr. and ❖ ❖ Mrs. Prank Hara of Tokeland. ♦> Urge Importance of Parents Recording Births of Children The Washington state board of health is conducting a campaign to emphasize the Importance of parents' recording the birth of children. An instance is given by the board. A child was born in Ballard to Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Emanuel, April 26, 1913. In a short time Mr. and Mrs. Emanuel moved to New York . The mother with the children went abroad on a visit. On their return to the United States they were detained at Ellis Island. A birth certificate was necessary to show the nativity of the child born in Ballard. A telegram was sent to this department and within a few hours a certified copy of the birth certificate, which had been properly filed, was on its way to New York, and all inconvenience to the parents immediately relieved. The state board of health estimates that only about 60 per cent of the births in Washington are properly re corded. The large majority of those not recorded are attended by mid wives, nurses, etc., though some phy sicians have been found negligent in this matter. U. P. BUYS TIES HERE The Union Pacific railway system has ordered about 600,000 railroad ties of Grays Harbor mills in the past three months. The orders total some 25,- 000,000 feet and 1,000 cars will be re quired for their shipping. The ties were sold at $8 a thousand feet, mak ing the orders, distributed among sev eral local mills, total about $2t10,000. The whole order of the Union Pacific was for about 1,000,000 ties, the other 400,000 going to mills of other sec tions. The ties will be distributed from Portland over the system. ROSS BONDS LIFTED The Pacific county superior court lias ruled that the bonds furnished for Frank Ross, now serving time in the county jail, are not forfeited by his failure to report in time to begin serving sentence with his brother, Earl. TO START UP AGAIN On January 1, according to report from Montesano, the C. C. L. & T. com pany, a logging concern of the Grays Harbor Commercial company, is to start operations after a shut down of years. It will employ 150 to 200 men. The Simpson Logging company is re ported to have given orders to work all its camps full time. The Hoquiam Sash & Door company, according to rumor, is to start u;. soon. JACKA VICTORIOUS W. A.

The president tells how this country practiced neutrality and declares that he hopes that when the time comes for readjustment and recuperation this country will be of Infinite service. Re ferring to Central and South American problems, the president declares that we should retain unabated the spirit which has Inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are In her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advan tage of her In her distress and under take to Impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Lib erty Is often a fierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can he set and to which no bounds of a tar men's choosing ought ever to be sat Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tf»- dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which in the greet days in which our government was set up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine Is, "That government Is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple. nation or community;" that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness and safety and Is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and that when any government shall be found Inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of tho community hath an indubitable, inalienable nnd (Continued on Page Two) A.
