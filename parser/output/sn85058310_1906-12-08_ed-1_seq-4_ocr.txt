THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Wo have read a great many press comments, both home and foreign, on President Roosevelt's message to con gress. Few, if any, have commended themselves' to us so strongly as those of C. M. Jackson, editor of tho Stato Journal. According to our Ideas ho hits tho nail squarely on tho head. For these reasons wo adopt his com ments ns our own and reproduco them herewith: , "The custom for many years has been for the papers adhering to tho party in power to allude to tho message or tho president ns 'masterly and states manlike, ' while those or the opposi tion have devoted their attention to ward picking Haws in the document and discussing as impractical and " Inane sug;estIons offered to congress. "The Journnl has endeavored to di vest itself of party feeling In Its dis cussion of the message this year, and i review it with the dispassionate feel- Ing that would govern a criticism of the action of nn ordlnnry man. "Barring the absurd spelling which the executive Indulges in following out his pet Ideas on improving tho language, we sincerely believe this message Is the strongest document Mr. Roosevelt has written, and we think that for directness or statement, clear ness or enunciation, disclosure or Ideas and excellence or suggestion It Is en titled to rank with the messages of the greatest men who -have sat In tho executive chair. "We commend the message In all Its parts and urge every citizen of tho state to read it carefully over. Es pecially do wo suggest to tho mem- berselcct of the legislature that they peruse It, for embodied In the docu ment will be found some ideas that apply to state as well as. to national governments. The president does not indulge In much bounuet-throwing in his introduction. A row lines or open ing and ho plunges Into business by suggesting that corporation campaign contributions bo prohibited. A volume or commendations might be written on that topic alone, but we are forced to pass' It by with only a brief allusion. "Tho right of the government to ap peal In criminal cases In matters ot law is the next suggestion, and It Is a good one. Why the United States has permitted this fatal defoct In legal practice to go uncorrected for one hundred and thirty years is some tiling or a matter ot wonder. As the executive suggests, It will bo almost Impossible to secure convictions of great corporations charged with crime unless this provision is made. The president discusses this matter very learnedly and succinctly nnd, ns It Is not couched in tho lore of lawyers, can bo readily understood. "His remarks on tho subject or lynching contain much food for thought. Tho people or tho south will do well to read and reflect, for the ad vice tendered Is sago and sound. 'Lawlessness grows upon what It reeds upon.' The president handles tho topic without gloves nnd goes to tho very bottom or tho question from the start. "Wo like his remarks upon tho sub lect of capital and labor, and think ho treats tho matter fairly, according to both sides, the rights to which they I ore entitled. We think tho legislative j measures suggested by him will do I much toward bringing about a better understanding between the opposing , dements. Especially do wo commend 1$ his nttltudo on tho labor of women nnd children, and direct the nttentlon of the legislating to tho suggestions i therein contnined, nnd urge our own executive to ndopt them in his mes sage to tho senate and house this ;
