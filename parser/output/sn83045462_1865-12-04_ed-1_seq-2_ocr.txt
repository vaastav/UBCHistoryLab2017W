Stockton, Senator elect from New Jersey. Mr. Cowan presented the protest of member! of the Legislature of New Jersey, alleging that a majority of that body had not voted for Mr. | Stockton," and that he "was not therefore con; stitutionally elected. The protest was ordered to lie on the table for 'he present, and Mr. Stockton took the prescribed oath. bit. sumner imroaucea mils 01 tne loiiowing title*: A bill to carry oat tbe principles of a republican form of government in tbe District ol Columbia: a bill prescribing an oatb to maintain a republican form of government in the rebel States; a bill in part execution of tbe guarantee of a republican form of government in tbe Constitution of tbe United States; a bill en tbe subject of appropriate legislation to enforce the amendment of the Constitution prohibiting slavery; a bill to preserve the right of trial by jury by'securing impartial jurors in tbe courts of tbe United States; a bill to enforce tbe guarantee of republican form of government in certain States whoee governments have been usurped and overthrown. Mr. Sumner introduced the following joint resolutions:?Joint resolution declaratory of the amendment abolishing s avery: a series of resolutions declaring the duty of tJongress, especially in respect to the loyal citizens of rebel . States; a series of resolutions declaratory of the duty of Congress with respect to guarantees of tbe national security and national faith in the rebel States. The above were all ordered 1 to be printed. Mr. Wade introduced a bill to regulate the franchise in the District of Columbia, which j was ordered to be printed. Mr. Harris introduced n bill to regulate the i Judiciary of the United States; ordered to be printed. Mr. \Vil?on introduced a bill to maintain the 1 freedom of the inhabitants of States declared in ! rebellion: ordered to be printed. Adjourned at 1 o'clock. Horexor Kki'kkskstativrr ?Mr. McPherscn, at noon, proceeded, in accordance with lav , lo call the roll of the members elect of the Tl.irty-ninth Congress. Mr. Maynard (whose name is not on the roll) w antfd to make a suggestion, but the Clerk relu>ed to be interrupted. The roll call was completed, 175 members having answered to their names. Mr. Morrill moved that the House proceed to the election of a Speaker. Mr Maynard desired to submit a remark before that question was put. Mr. Stevens called the gentleman to order. Mr. M? Pherson, the Clerk, said he could not recognize any one as a member whose name was not on the roll. J>Ir. Brooks hoped the motion wonld not prevail until it was settled whether Mr. Maynard was a member ol this House, or entitled to*be beard, lie hoped the House would not proceed to any revolutionary steps, as now indicated. If Tennessee was not in the I'nion and a loyal State, by what right does the President himself hold bis seat at the White House J He trusted the gentleman would be heard, for if the rule of exclusion should prevail, the Clerk would have an over hadowing power, in violation of the principles of republican government. Mr. Rrooks, in further discussion of the subject, asked by what law of right old Virginia was excluded, and why was Louisiana, whose members at the commencement of the lurmer Congress, were allowed to vote for Speaker. He said, in the course of his speech, that the r? solution adopted by the Republican caucus uii vi?iiiiviuj niu in iruuru no ail aili^KUIUMU IU the forthcoming message of the President of the Vnited States. Mr. Ste\ ens raised the point of order that it was heretofore held that besides the election of a Speaker or a motion to adjourn no other busint-.-s \\.'<s in order prior to organization. Mr. McPherson held the point to be well taken. Finally, tinder the operation of the previous question, the House proceeded to the election of a Speaker. Mr. Morrill nominated Hon. Schuyler Colfax Mr. Win Held nominated Hon. Jas. Brook?. Messrs. Morrill, Dawson, Smith and Fink w? re appointed tellers. The result was announced: Whole number of votes, 175; necessary to a choue, ??. ! Of which Mr. Colfax received 139 Mr. Brooks 3o Mr. Colfax was therefore declared elected Smaker.

The speech is as lollows: OtHtlrmennf the Tfr/uteof R<pre*entalivet:?The re-ass* mblmg of Congress, marking, as it does, the procession of our national history, is al ways regarded with interest by tbe people for whom it is to legislate. But it is not unsafe to say that millions more than ever before, North, South, East, and West, are looking to the Congress which opens its first session to-day with an earnestness and solicitnde unequalled on similar occasions in the past. The Thirty-eighth CongTess closed its constitutional existence with the Storm cloud of ur.ir at 11 1 Inworin rr ftvn*. And, alter a nine months' absence, Congress rwcmcs it? legislative authority in those Council Halls, rejoicing that from shore to shore in our land there is peace. Its duties are as obvious as the snn's pathway in the heavens. Representing, in its two branches, the State* and the people, its first and hiphest obligation u to guarantee to every State a republican form of Government. The rebellion having overthrown constitutional State government* in many States, it is yours to mature and enact legislation which, with th< concurrence ot the txecutive, shall establi.-h them anew, on such a basis of enduring justice as will guarante? all necessary safeguards to the people, and afford, what our >I:igiia Charta, tbe Declaration of Independence, proclaims is the chief object of Government?protection to all men in their inalienable rights. The world should witness, in this great work, themost inflexible fidelity. ih?* most "amest devotion to the principles of liberty and humanity; the truest patriotism, and the wisest statesmanship. Heroic men by the hundreds of thousands have dud that the Republic might live. The inblems of mouru.ng have darkened White House and cabin alike. Hut the fires of civil war have melted ev?-ry fetter in the land, and proved the funeral pyre ot slavery. It n for you. representatives, to do your work as faithfully and as well as did the fearless saviors of iLe Vision on their more dangerous arena of duty. '1 lien we may hope to seethe vacant and once abandoned seats around us gradually tilling up, until this Hall t-hall contain Representatives from every Slate and District, their hearts devoted to the I'uion for which they are to legislate, jealous of its honor, proud of its glory, watchful of its rights, and hostile to us entmies. And the stars on our banner that paied wh? n the States tliey represented arrayed th< mselves inarms against the nation u ill rhine with a more brilliant light of loyalty than ever before luvoking the guidance of Him who hold the destinies of nations In the hollow of his hand, 1 enter again upon the duties of this trying position, with a heart filled with gratitude to \oi. for the unusually flattering manner in v. iin il i> u.i? iif?*ii wsiuwfa; unu cfircred by the bo]ir tba: it he'.okeiiK your cordial imp port ainl nftutancf in all it* grave responsibilities. 1 :im now ready to lake the oath of office piescribed by law.

Governor Hamilion has authorized the Chief Justices of counties to raise a special police force of fifty citizens and maintain peace and enforce order. They are to act with the military Provost Marshal as published by an order from the Department headquarters. Gov. Hamilton has issued a very sensible address to the freedmen. In some of the interior counties the freedmen commenced making contracts for the next year on rich coast plantations. The planters generally abandoned planting except so far as was necessary for the support of their families. Old business men at Galveston and Houston are holding back from trade being apprehensive of a general collapse by March or Anril. An extensive conflagration occurred at Columbus, Miss, on Saturday, destroying the building known as the Confederate Arsenal, with ?<<? bales of cotton. Loss a million dollars.

Tbe floor of marble tile is all laid down, and several busts of distinguished m?*n are mounted on pedestals within tbe high bronze railing which borders tbe narrow passage. A new carpet, imported from France, has been put down on the floor of the House, | and new furniture has been added to many of the adjacent apartments. With the exception I ot tht? mrrp.wd nnmhor nf fni? mamhuM the Hall presents, however, th?* same appearance as last winter, the carpet being light preen, with small orange.coloreu stars. Xo change is noticeable in the Senate wing. Hy 12 o'clock all the corridors surrounding the Hall of Representatives were blocked up by the throug, hundreds making strenuous efforts to force a passage into the reporters' gallery, which by great exertion on the part of th* doorkeeper, was preserved exclusively for the members of the press. Th*? families of r presentatives ot foreign governments filled th?> gallery assigned to the diplomatic corps, many being compelled to stand in tb^ aisle and doorway. During the call of the roll by the ClTk of the House, the space in rear of the members' ureia >vu wiupiru ay a crown oi visitors, whom the doorkeepers were unable to eject. There were quite a number of Southern Representatives present, most of them taking seats among the other members. As the Clerk was calling the roll of the members lrom New York, Mr. Maynard, of Tennessee, rose to speak, but was prevented from proceeding by the Clem, who stated that no remarks at that time were in order. At the conclusion of the call of the roll, Mr. Morrill, | of Vermont, moved that the House proceed to the election of Speaker. Mr. Maynard again attempted to be heard, hut was silenced by cries of order. Mr. lirooks, of New York, protested against the refusal to hear Mr. Maynard. and spoke at considerable length, claiming that if Tennessee was not a State of the Union, and if Maynard was to be regarded as an alien, the j Pret-ident of the United States, a citizen of Tennessee, was also an alien and an usurper. He also demanded that the members from Virginia and Louisiana shonld be admitted, and denounced the refusal of the House as despotism. Mr. Brooks was frequently called to order during his remarks by Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, and others, and finally sliced Mr. Stevens when he proposed to consider the question. Mr. Stevens replied that he "proposed to consider it at the proper time." The response elicited considerable applause from the members and spectators. Mr. Brooks then moved as an amendment to the motion for an election of Speaker that Mr. Maynard be allowed to make his statement. This was loudly I uujcviru iu. After further discussion of a similar nature, the election of Speaker was ordered. Mr. Morrili, of Vermont, nominated Mr. Colfax, and Mr Winlield, of New York, nominated Mr. Brooks, of the same State. THE
