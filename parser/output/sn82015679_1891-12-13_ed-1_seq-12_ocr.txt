Stockton. gpecial arrangements bare been made for the publication, la next Sunday's Journal, of a novelette by Frank IL Stockton. It is a Christ ian love story entitled "Major rendallaa," and U invested with the unique charm eo character lstic of this writer's work. Stockton has a pe culiar twlat in his mental make-up that leads liim to place his characters in the moat remarka ble situations, and at the same time give such happenings an air of the greatest naturalness, lie Invariably succeeds in gaining the reader's attention, and holding it to tho end. These char acteristics are well shown in ".Major Pendalla,' which is a highly entertaining and attractive story. As befits a Christmas love story, or. In deed, a love story of any , kind, the outcome is happy, and the Journal congratulates its readers on the treat in store for them. Silver has declined a little during tho past iree, so that tho standard silver dollar is worth a fraction less than 74 cents. Perhaps Governor Hill's sugges tion of a silver dollar worth a gold one in tho smelting-pot has depressed the white metal. The amount of money in circulation jteir capita in this country was never so largo as now $24.28 and is larger than that of any country in tho world except France, but noamount of money can fill the pockets of those who will not work, have nothing to sell, or who cannot rest eo long as they have an unspent dime. Old negroes in some parts of tho South aro being swindled by whito men, who represent themselves as govern ment agents authorized to place ex filaycs on tho pension roll. After put ting tho negro through a pretended ex amination he is required to pay a foe, from Si to $3. It takes a pretty low down white man to engage in that sort of business. The Alexander Smith & Sons Carpet Company, of New York, the largest car pet manufacturing concern in the world, has issued its price-list for next season. It shows that carpets of all kinds will bo fully 10 per cent, lower next spring than they were last year, or than they have ever been before in the history of their manufacture. The McKinley bill gets tho credit. , The fact that Joaquin Miller is a poet seems to be accepted as an argument against him by newspaper paragraphers, who accept without question his disrep utable son Harry's assertion that his father ill-treated him. It should be re membered that the elder Miller has never been heard from in his own behalf, either in this case or that of his daugh ter, who gained unpleasant notoriety a year or so ago. His silence is in his favor. Judgment, at least should bo suspended until the other side of the story is heard. Even a poet may have some redeeming qualities. The Chicago News takes occasion to rcbuko those flippant papers which put headings overtho .President's message like "Little Ben's Message. It says that even if the message was that of the smallest President, he is the cinel magis trate of a great nation, and for that rea son he should be respectfully spoken of in connection with the discharge of a nublic.duty. As for President Harrison, this" anti-Republican paper adds, Vho has made an enviable record as the Na tion's chief executive," and, further, that 'the nigger-minstrel business of 'grand father's hat' has been brushed asido by his dignified and able administration of public' affairs." flaBMaaas-aaB-BBHBHBBHa) The IndianaCommaudery of the Loyal Legion has taken steps to revive tho bill which was passed by the House, last year, designed to prevent tho desecra tion of the Hag of the United States, by sending a circular to other patriotic or ( conizations and to the Indiana delega tion in Congress requesting that tho Caldwell bill, so-called, bo presented and urged to passage. This bill pro vides that the printing on the Hag of an advertisement for public display shall be a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $30 or imprisonment not less than thirty days, or both, at the discretion of the court. As the tendency seems to be to use the flag for these purposes, some such law seem' to be necessary. The Right Rev. Monsignor O'Brycn, a member of the Pope's ecclesiastical staff, is now in New York on church business. He says tho Pope has no idea of leaving Rome, and never has had. He adds: "King Humbert is the ono who must go. When Humbert goes, then the strained relations which have existed between the Vatican and tho government for twenty years can readily be arranged by diplomacy, Dut it never will be until Humbert goeR." This sim ply shows that a man can live in Rome and yet be utterly ignorant of the tem per or purposes of the Italian govern ment and people. That King Humbert will vacate Rome in favor of the Pop is about as probable as that -Emperor William will abdicate his throne In favor of a Methodist bishop. OUS 

LATEST TERRITORIAL ACQUISITION Tho President says in hi3 message: "Tho island of Navassa, in the West In dian group, has, under tho provisions of Title 72 of the Revised Statutes, been recognized by tho President as apper taining to the United States." In other words, wo have acquired the island. It is not ranch of an acquisition, and it came about in an accidental way. Navassa is a vcrj' small guano island, lying about twenty-seven miles off the coast of Hayti. In 1872 an American company established itself on the island and commenced working tho guano de posits. Hayti immediately made a vig orous protest against what was termed a filibustering expedition and claimed the island as one of her dependencies. The matter became a subject of diplo matic representation at Washington, but Hayti'a protest received no consid eration. If she owned tho island sho had never asserted her ownership, though the Haytian authorities did claim not only that the island was a part of her geographical system, but that it is mentioned in their Constitution ns be longing to her political jurisdiction. Of course it is not credible that an island lying only twenty-seven miles from tho mainland should not have been visited before the American company took possession of it. They found it unoccupied and jumped the claim. As there was nov other Hag in sight they raised the American flag. Tho company remained in possession and continued to export the guano under Sections 5570 and 5578 of the United States Revisod Statutes, which provide that whenever any citizen of the United States discov ers a deposit of guano on any island not within the lawful jurisdiction of any other government and not occupied by the citizens of any other government, and takes peaceable possession thereof and occupies tho same, "such island may, at the discretion of the President, be considered as pertaining to the United States." The reason why the President has ex ercised his discretionary power of rec ognizing the island as pertaining to tho United States is in order to extend pro tection to tho laborers there employed. Tho law under which tho American company has been working tho guano deposits on the island also provides that all crimes committed on any island so occupied shall be deemed committed on the high seas, and shall bo punisha ble in tho United States courts. About two years ago the laborers on the island revolted and killed somo of tho agents of the company. They were arrested, brought to Baltimore, tried, convictod and sentenced to death. The President commuted this sentence because he bo came satisfied that their revolt had been brought about ' by cruel treat ment. Later ho sent a United States naval vessel to the island, with directions to the officers to investigate the condition of the laborers there and report. They reported a condition of affairs approaching slavery. The la borers were badly treated, kept on tho island by force, and had no protection or remedy. On this state of facts tho President determined to exercise the discretion vested in him by law of rec ognizing the island as appertaining to the United States. In making this an nouncement to Congress ho recommends "legislation that shall place labor con tracts upon this and other islands hav ing tho relation that Navassa has to tho United. States, under the supervision of a court commissioner, and that shall provide, at the expense of the own ers, an officer to reside upon the islands with power to judge and adjust disputes, and to enforce a just and humane treat ment of the employes." It remains to be seen whether our pos session of Navassa will be permanent or not. Hayti has not yet withdrawn her claim to it, and if she should renew tho claim it might be difficult to resist it on just grounds. Of course, Hayti could not enforco the claim, but tho United States could not afford to steal an island from Hayti. Our present possession of tho island ie not necessarily permanent. The law under which the authority of the United States has been asserted over it provides that nothing in tho law "shall bo construed as obligating the United States to retain possession of such islands after the guano shall have been removed from tho same." Navassa is only useful for its guano, and after that is gone there will be no object in hold ing tho island. The original occupation of tho island savored strongly of fili bustering, but tho action of the Presi dent in taking steps to protect the American laborers there 'pending tho settlement of the question ns to owner ship of the island is clearly right. 

CONJUGAL AFFECTION AUD M03ET. The advocates of the advancement of women aro likely to take tho recent de cision of the Indiana Supreme Court re garding tho right of the wife to suo tho other woman for alienation of her hus band's affections ns an indication of progress. They will naturally say that whereas the Indiana law formerly per mitted the husband to demand damages of the villain who estranged the wife from her lawful spouse and made no provision for a similar proceeding by an aggrieved woman, it was but a proper and equitable adjustment of matters that has made legal action pos sible on the -part of the lat ter. If a man, they will say, can demand of the destroyer of his do mestic peace largo sums of money as a salve for his lacerated feelings, why should not a woman have a liko recourso against her successful rivalT Appar ently, the Supreme Court saw no rea son, and answered the conundrum ac cordingly; but possibly tho court and the progressive woman aforesaid do not take into consideration all tho motives -that may have led tho early legislators to adopt a statute seemingly so uirfair. When these ancient worthies made it possible for a husband to ask and ob-. tain thousands of dollars as a recom pense for stolen affections they were certainly demonstrating their be lief that such affections were of high value and . their loss a se rious injury to tho despoiled person. When they, made no arrangement for a similar demand by a wife, may they not have been proceeding on the theory that man was a being with a miscellaneous stock of affections that might be be stowed upon tho wife of his bosom or scattered about promiscuously without material disadvantage to the wifef In short, did not tho legal fathers compli ment woman by rating her affections at a high figure and discredit man by at taching no value whatever to his ten derest passions! To bo sure, the modern reading of tho law puts more filthy lucro in sight of the woman whoso husband's vagrant fancy wanders in forbidden paths, but tho progressive sisters should consider welt whether it is a gennino ad vancement to bo placed on a level with men whoso love was once considered no loss when it strayed away. THE FIRST Q0VEEN0S OF INDIANA. Judge Lewis Jordan announces as a discovery of historic interest that Pat rick Henry, the celebrated orator of tho revolution, was "tho first Governor of Indiana." The statement is inaccurate. If Patrick Henry was ever Governor of Indiana it was only in a technical sense, and even in that sense he was not its first Governor. It has always' been known that Patrick Henry was Gov ernor of Virginia from 177C to 1779, and that in that capacity he assisted in organizing and equipping, in 1777, the expedition of Col. George Rogers Clark, which resulted in the capture of Vin cennes, and, eventually, in wresting the Northwest Territory from the British. This is a matter of open history, the facts being fully stated in Dunn's His tory of Indiana and elsewhere. After Clark's first capturo of Vin cennes it was recaptured by the Brit ish and held by them until the summer of 1779, when it was again taken by tho Americans under Clark. From this time it remained in possession of the Americans. On Aug. 5, 1779, Clark is sued general orders for the military control of the Northwest, appointing a commandant for the post at Vincennes, the name- of which had already been changed to Fort Patrick Henry, in honor of tho then Governor of Virginia. The real capture of tho Northwest Territory, of which Indiana was a part, dates from this time, but Great Britain did not re linquish her claim to tho territory till four years later. Therefore, Patrick Henry, as Governor of Virginia in 1779, could not bo said to have been Gover nor of tho territory now called Indiana, which was temporarily wrested from the British in that year and held under military control. As a matter of fact, the conquered territory did not becomo a part of tho United States until the treaty of peaco in 1783, when Great Britain formally re linquished her claim. It was not until then that the Go vernor of Virginia could bo said even technically to have been the Governor of the territory now called IndiannCnnd then Patrick Henry was not Governor of Virginia. Ho was re-elected Governor in 1784, and served till 178G. but tho Governor of Virginia in 1783 was Benjamin Harrison, a signer of tho Declaration of Independence and an ancestor of President Harrison. If, therefore, it is correct to say that the Governor of Virginia was, by virtue of that office, Governor of tho territory subsequently called Indiana, then the first Governor of Indiana was that Gov ernor of Virginia who was in office when Indiana first came into the full and legal possession of the United States by tho treaty of 1763. As already stated, that was Gov. Benjamin Harrison, who served from 1782 to 17&4. Really it is inaccurate to say that any Governor of Virginia was, by virtue of that office, Governor of Indiana. Vir ginia's claim to the Northwest Territory was very shadowy, and her right of gov ernment was never exercised. What ever there was of it was extinguished by the passage of the Ordinance of 1787, while tho Territory of Indiana was not organized until 1800. Singularly enough, tho first Governor of tho Territory, ap pointed July 4, 1800, was William Henry Harrison, a son of the Benjamin Harri son who was Governor of Virginia when Indiana, under the treaty of 1783, first becamo a part of tho United States. Patrick Henry died in 1799. If ho ever heard tho namo Indiana used at ail it was in reference to a largo tract of un occupied land lying in what is now West Virginia, which was granted by the In dians in 17G3 to a number of Indian traders, who called themselves the In diana Company. Census Bulletin No. 131 gives statis tics relative to nearly a score of relig ious organizations, most of which aro represented in Indiana, which are doubt less unknown to most people. The Mennouites contribute the greatest number of these small sects, there being no less than twelve distinct church or ganizations. Tho total number of com municants is only 41,541, of which 17,078 are connected with tho original body, from which all tho others came out, while the smallest faction, tho Apostolic Mennonites, has only 209 communicants. Nine of these branches of tho Mennonite sect exist in this State, the aggregate membership being 3,732. This is the most f ceding church in existence. The Brethren, or Dnnkards, sometimes called the German Baptists, is another sect with strong tendencies toward inde pendent organization. The Conserva tive Brethren is, however, the main branch. It has a membership of 61,101, with church property valued at $1,121, 541. In this State are 107 of tho 720 organizations, tho largest number in any State, while tho Indiana membership, 10,224, is second only to that of Pennsylvania. 14.191. The Pro gressive Brethreu has 123 organizations, with 8.C89 communicants, of which twenty-two organizations and 1,449 members nro in 'Indiana. The most widely-dis- tributedof these fragmentary sects is the non-polygamous Mormons, whose official titlo is "tho Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." While it has only a membership of 21, 773, it has churches in thirty-six States and three Territories. One-fourth of tho membership is iu Iowa, but Indiana, which seems to be prolific in frag mentary religious sects, has thirteen or ganizations, with 300 members, Thero are thirty-one communistic organiza tions in the United States, all but two of which have a religious basis. Their membership is only 4,170, which shows that the community idea is not very popular. The Journal has received a letter from tho Northwestern Miller, published at Minneapolis, questioning the claim of the Journal to having first suggested the sending of a cargo of flour to the starving Russian peasants. Tho North western Miller claims the credit of the first suggestion itself. The editor 6ays: As a matter ot fact wo have been in cor respondence with the Kussian charge d'af faires relative to the matter for somo months, and will produce copies of onr tel egraphic communications to substantiate our claim. Not only have wo arranged the plan with the Kussian authorities, bnt we have brought it beforo the millers of the United States, and. as a result of onr ef forts, have secured subscriptions of Hour from local mills amounting to over 4W.0OO pounds, or fifteen car-loads. This amount is growing daily. Through the columns of this journal and by rivo thousand circular letters addressed to katum millers all over the United States, wo aro agitating the matter, and, as a result, expect to secure a ship-load to iro as a free gift from the American millers to the Kussian peasants. The Journal first suggested the mat ter in an editorial entitled "Why Not HelpRu8sia!" published Nov. 29. It is quite clear 'from the foregoing extract that the Northwestern Miller has been agitating the matter much longer than that, and deserves tho credit of first suggesting it. All that tho Journal can claim is that its own suggestion was original when made, no referenco to tho matter having been seen by it in any other paper previous to that time. It is glad to know that tho movement is in such competent hands. as those of the Northwestern Miller, and wishes it great success in the humane undertak ing. : , News from Rome via St. Paul is not apt to bo very reliable. The startling information that Cardinal Gibbons will probably bo the next Pope, although obtained from "a high authority in tho church at St. Paul," is doubtless purely fanciful. The next Pope will be a European, and probably an Italian. Of tho College of Cardinals who elect the Pope, nearly one-half of the sixty are Italians. Three of these are much talked of for the papal succession, viz.: Car dinals Battaglini, Parocchi and Monaco. Tho first is sixty-eight years old, the second fifty-eight and the third sixty four. It is needless ' to T say that all are men of ability and learning. It is prob ablo that one of theso thrco will be the next Pope; if not one of these, then somo other Italian cardinal, and if not an Italian, a European cardinal of somo other nationality. Asido from all other considerations thej fait that Cardinal Gibbons does not spcalc either Italian or French, tho only languages spoken at tho papal court, 'would be conclusive against him. . ti . , . It may be doubted if in any city in the land of the sfzo. of '. Indianapolis a private citizen lives whose death would call forth such an expression of the sense of personal bereavement, as well as of public loss, as has that of Mr. Mc Culloch. The tributes which tho clergy paid to his character and work wero just, and the thousands in this city who will read them to-day, as well as tho hundreds. .who heard them yesterday, will feel that'Rev DrHaines expressed the public sentiment when he said: "We are all mourners." That fact is the highest tribute to tho man whose name and deeds are yet on tho tongues of thousands, and the precious remem brance of which will dwell in hundreds of hearts as. long as life shall last. The latest issue of the American Gas-light Journal has something to say concerning the so-called "Harris process" of making fuel gas, said to be in operation at Mays- ville, Ky. This is the process in which some of our local capitalists have become interested. - The Gas-light Journal says: Leaves may.f all and springs run dry, but there Is never a drought m the flow of patents that are issued to the discoverers ot new gas processes, whereby lucl and lliuniiiiatinff! pases are pro duced at liffures never iu excess of 8 cents, aud often at less thau 5 cent.", per thousand cubio feet. To le sure, these workers in the Held of usually select botuo out-of-the way Dlaco wherein to exploit their discoveries in a practic al way Mushvllle, Tex., boredom, A.

Seeniiiitdy they are thus humble be cause they would fain preserve their individual ity by refusing to locato an experimental works in lioston, 'ew York, Philadeluhia, Chicaco or other l:ir;e. places, easy of access, whero their fccbeme would be more easily luveatiated. Hardly has the "Johnson process" been succeed ed by the "Proctor process" than it is followed by tho "Hall melange," and Hall's brief hour is not really over when "Harris" enters tho door. Wo have no hesitation in savin that it is the veriest of humbug, aud the wonder is that men honestly eu gaged in The raanutact ure of gas are induced to pay any attcnUon to claims that are so absurd. Of course, due allowance must be made for the prejudice of a journal which is avowedly the organ of the old-fashioned illuminating gas: Whether the Harris pro cess is a success or not. there is no doubt whatever that good gas can be made and sold at a profit much cheaper than any gas company in tho United States is now sell ing it. Cheap fuel gas is one of the cer tainties of the near future. Some excitement has been caused at Ann Arbor by the action of the college authori ties in refusing to permit the issue of the November number of a uuiversity maga zine, which contained an article attacking co-education. Tho ollensive article was ex punged before tho magazine was per mitted to be issued. It aimed to show that co-education drove men away from the university and destroyed college life, con cluding as follows: The admission of women was soon followed by a decline in attendanoo upon the university: by a considerable dt-clint in numbers attending tho literary department; by a large decrease iu the male academic- attendance; by a serious and still continuing diminution in the number of male classical students, and by a noticeable reduotion in the annual number of male academic grad uates, many classes being smaller than their pre decessors of ten or fifteen years before. The medical department, where many women have studied, has lost men. while the law school and the school ot pharmacy, two schools where few women enter, show a large growth. A California named Christy has in vented a new telephone which has been tested on long distances, and is said to work perfectly. The instrument is do scribed asvery simple. There is nothing to get out of order, and it costs but 00 cents to manufacture. The wire used is as thin as a spider's web, being but 15UO of an inch in diameter. By the- Christy system of tele phone there will be no central otlico to harass men's souls. Over each 'phono will be two discs, punctured. with boles. When you want a number, revolve your discs till they correspond, insert the alnraininm plug i and yoa have your connection. All this is j very simple on paper, but the question is how to get around the Bell patent. It is gravely announced iu a Democratic newspaper that Mrs. Crisp, wife of the new Speaker of tho House, has long regarded the number seven as her "hoodoo," and that on last Saturday, when she heard that the caucus nominations had been postponed until Monday, the 7th day of the month, she gave np all hope of her husband's suc cess. Inasmuch as he was chosen on that day. Mrs. Crisp doubtless looks upon her hoodoo as 'downed," but if she will wait a few months, and will note the unhappy re sults likely to come to her hnsband and his party throngh that nomination, she will probably be convinced that it still pursues her. Up to the 5th inst. tho, shipment of American apples abroad the present season had reached a total of 837.391 barrels as against S0G.311 barrels during the samo period last year. Of this total, 520,475 bar rels went to Liverpool, 92.977 to London, and 208,030 to Glasgow. The City of New York took out last week 5,920 barrels, and the Britannic, 0.725. The total amount sent abroad last week was 27.093 barrels. The price of apples abroad is about double what it Is in New York. Mrs. Frank Leslie Wilde reports to the New York police that she has received a letter from a "Jack the Ripper," threaten ing her with dynamite unless she gave him money. Although this enterprising 1 .dy is now married, and tho eccentricitir.. of as pirants for her hand no longer form a sub ject for public comment, there are other ways of breaking into tho papers, Mrs. Wilde is a woman of resources.

Sensational stories about the Rev. Dr. Wbittaker, ot Lynn, Mass., having been nearly frozen to death during a hunting trip in Maine, have been going the rounds of the New England press. The true story is that he did lose himself in the woods, but kindled a lire, cooked his supper, and passed a comfortable night, being nono the worse lor the adventure. Joux M.

Mr. James Whitcomb Riley's "Flying Isl ands of the Night." a drama in verse, and his first sustained poetic fiigbt, not only differs entirely in character and style from the work that has made him so well known to tho publio. but is also a novel departuro in . modern literature. Already be had covered a wide field. In his dialect verso he depicts the char acteristics of uncultured rural Americans as no other writer hasdone. llis"Hoosicrs" are the genuine article diamonds in the rough, men and women without conven tional polish, but delightfully honest and human and not caricatures,' as other would-be word artists too often make them. In bis poems for children he speaks to the little ones as one ot themselves a child among children. In other verse he touches the heights aud depths of emotion from crave to gay. from sadness to rejoicing. He sings with the happy lover, and in sympathy with the sorrow ing oilers a prayer of trustfulness "in the watches of the night." All these songs and rhymes appeal to the popular taste and es tablish themselves in the heart because they are recognized as absolutely truthful delineations of the various phases of life aud of feeling. It is because the liken-ss is so accurate that tho art of the poet is not always appreciated at its full value. Tho realism of the work is so evident that ad mirers fail to discover the glamour tbat the poetie imagination throws over the picture and that really makes its charm. Be cause the reader knows the counterpart of "Beni. F. Johnson of Boono" and of the "Kaggedy Man," it does not tollow that he would have represented those personages iu similar colors, had not their attractive personality been first disclosed by a magi cian's wand. There are those who hold that it is a strong and vivid imagination as well as a tender aud sympathetic insight that is capable of investing common place personages and everyday scenes with an attraction and loveliness they had not been known to possess: but that this imagination has still a wider scope is shown in "The Flying Islands." It Is a versatile genius, truly, that can please tho popular taste with "The Old Swimmin' Hole," "The Frost on the Punkin," "Old fashioned Roses'' and all the long list of favorites, and can produce a work like this latest. There is nothing of the realistic, certain ly, about "The Flying Islands." It is a purely imaginative production, and of an original sort. That a nineteenth century writer, a century in which the practical is uppermost and fairy lore out of date, has evolved such an eerie talo must be the first wonder of those who read. The usual modern fairy story is but a base imitation of the genuine. Authors use theaccepted machine ry of such literature merely as a thin dis guise for a moral lesson a sort of sugar-coating for a disagreeable, dose. Mr. Riley lets his fancy wander free, and the creatures of his brain exist because they must, and to teach no lesson whatever. The tale of itself is straightforward and simple; the characters are few. The scene is laid in the Hying islands. Krung is King of the bpirks. Orestillomeem theCueen, his second wife, and the villain of the play. Spraivoll (where does Mr. Riley get his names!) is tune-fool; Amphine is Prince; Dwaiuie, Princess of the Wunks and a wanderer from Wunkland. Jucklet is a dwarf' and a conspirator with the Qjieen against the welfare of the King and Prince. Creech and Gritchfang are night mares. (Did the writer dream their names!) In the first weird scene faces without bod ies emerging from the gloom, and holding discourse show themselves to be the wicked Queen's familiars. The drama turns upon the efforts of the Queen to gain the throne, and to attain her end she uses her power as a sorceress. Her incantatious are opposed by thoso of a rival enchantress, Princess Dwainie, the visitor from another flying island, and, after due course of time and much transformation of scene and of characters, virtue triumphs and the 'King comes to his own. The story moves on smoothly and rapidly from the start. Tho text is in terspersed with airy songs that almost carry their music with them. The situa tions are artistic, aud suggest a ready adaptability to theatrical representation. The prevailing taste is too much in the line of tank dramas and. of real horses and other live stock on the stage to be ready for such a fanciful creation as when stage managers this, perhaps, but come, in time, to cater to n more retined element they can not do better thau to turn attention to this work. It would be difficult to produce it without injuring its fairy-like character, but it can be done. The gorgeous spectac ular ettects reqnired may be Indicated by the setting of the final act, which is thus described: The King lifts his scepter and agustof melody, divinely beautiful, sweeps through the court. The star above the throne loosens and drops slowly downward, bursting like a bubble on the scepter-tip. and, issuing therefrom, Amphine and Dwainie, hand in band, kneel at the leet of Krung, who bends above them with bis blessing, while Jucklet capers wildly round the group. The text tempts to quotation, but space will allow room only for thissome what dar ing conception a song of Amphine to his love: O empty hush of song! If deep withiu my heart the music thou Hast stored away might find an Issuance, A fount of limpid laughter would leap up And gurgle from my hps and all the winds Would revel with it, riotous with joy; Ana Dwainie in her beauty, would leave The battlements of night, tiud like tho moon. The glory of her face would light tho world For I would sing of love. Dwainie replies: And she would hear, Aiid. reaching overhead among the stars. Would scatter them liko daisies at thy feet. Whether Mr. Kiley will gain in popularity by this work may be doubted: it is even doubtful if the professional critics will bo pleased, since they will find nothing to compare it with and are governed by the conventional in litcratnre. Nevertheless, it marks his versatility and an epoch in his career, and to a circle of readers who con fess a secret fondness for Ariels, Oberons and Pncks that seldom receives fresh grati fication, this drama will come like a re freshing draught.
