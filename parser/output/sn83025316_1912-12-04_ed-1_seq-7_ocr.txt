S'BY TAFT PRESIDENT E*POUNDS DOCTRINE OF:bDOLLAR' FOR BULLETS* IN -MaSSAGE Washingtd-, Dec. 3.-President Taftao first -message to the last ses ":sion of congress in his term was re ceived 'with bt oese attenition of both branches whets legislative business be gan today. D ealing entirely with for .elgn relations and America's com mercial progress in foreign trade, the • message paved the way for -others, the chief executive will send later dealing with the big questions of legislation and government. A note of warning to European powers which by indirect means con tinue to discriminate against Americ ,an trade; a strong appeal to congress to uplift the great foreign policies of America above mere questions of partisanship; a triumphant vindica tion of the diplomacy .of the admin ,stratJon, which is characterized as 'that of "dollars versus bullets;" 'a masterful pride in the enormous ex pansion of American trade as a re sult of the foreign policies of his ad ministration; and an earnest appeal for joint action by congress and the executive to open new markets for .American industries-these are the more striking features of President Taft's fourth annual message sent to congress today. " The message is the first of a series of such communications which he will make to congress in the early days of the session, and deals entirely with the foreign relations of the United States. .Beginning with the usual reference to the existing good rela tions with foreign powers, the presi dent adds that these have been strengthened by "A greater insistence upon justice to American citizens, or Interests, wherever it may have been denied, and a stronger emphasis of the need of mutuality in commercial and other relations." For the first time in its history, says the president, the state depart ment has obtained substantially the most favored nation treatment from all of the countries of the world. Therefore, he says, that it is only natural that competitive -countries should view with some concern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning, "If in some instances, the measures taken by them to meet it are not entirely equitable, a remedy should be found." To this end, the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the govern ment, instead of imposing the full maximum rates of duty against dis criminating countries, to apply a graduated"scald of "duties, up to that maximum of 25 per cent. "Flat tariffs are out of date," says the president. "Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations, irrespective of the treatment from them received. It is very necessary that the American government should be equipped with weapons of negotiation and adapted to modern economic conditions." The state department, "an archaic and inadequate machine." at the be ginning of this administration) the president says, 'has become a new organization, with highly specialized bureaus and experts dealing with ev ery phase of American trade and diplomacy. Holding that the essence of this reorganized service is found in the merit system, which President Cleveland is credited with having in troduced, President Taft makes a strong appeal to congress to make this machine permanent, by giving the force of statutory law to the ex ecutive orders governing admission to and promotion in the diplomatic and consular services. To show that. these appointments are already largely nonpartisan, the president points to the ract that three of the present ambassadors are hold overs; that of the ten he has ap pointed, five were by promotion from the rank of minister; that of the 30 ministers appointed, 11 were promo tions; and that in the consular ser vice no less than 55 per cent of the consuls appointed by him were from the southern states. "The', diplomacy of the present ad ministration has sought to respond to modern ideas of commercial inter course," says President Taft. "This policy has been characterized as sub stituting dollars for bullets. It is one that appeals alike to idealistic human it4rian sentiments, to the dictates of sound policy and strategy, and to le gitimate commercial aims." The president adds that "because modern diplomacy is commercial there has been a disposition in some quar ters to attribute to it none but mater lalistic aims." "How strikingly erroneous is such an impression may be seen from a study of the results by which the diplomacy of the United States can be judged," says the president. Arbitration Treaties. He mentions arbitration treaties with France and Great Britain, which failed of confirmation in the senate; the successful tripartite mediation of the Argentine Republic, Brazil, and the Tnited States, between Peru and Ecuador; the arbitration of the Pana ma-Costa Rica boundary dispute; the intervention between Haiti and the Dominican republic on the verge of war, ,the suppression of the Nicar aguai war, the halting of internecine strife in Honduras, the adjustment of the celelrated Tagna-Arlca dispute between Peru and Chile, and the ad Justment of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian boundary issue. In consequence of these things, days the president, there has been a gen. eral easing of international tension on the west. coast of South America. He also adds tlWt the diplomacy of the United States is active in seeking to assuage thqel tnainng ill feeling be c, tween this dountry and Colombia, Taking up.some of the details agdrthe e.i~ar' diplomatle work, the president refers with ' expressions of pi4de to China, where, 'the policy of ucurt - aging fllnanetait- edtanent ..D pable bhat country to help itself hals had the result of giving new life and practical application to the opeg-door ° pqlicy. e, cnsisstent , ii'poie lbs bOeO to encu* the use. of Aanerian ital in China says the president, to promote the reforms to which that coisltry is pledged by treaty with t!e United States and, other powers. ~ite has been a vigorous assertion, also, he' says, of the equal right of the United States to a voice in all questions per tainng to Chinese., loans and develop -ments. A Charge. President Taft makes the direct charge that the terrible events record ed in Nicaragua recently, the useless loss of life, the devastation of proper ty, the bombardment of the principal cities, the killings and the tortures and .spifering, "might have-., been averted. had. the. department of state, through approval of the loan conven tion by the senate, been permitted to carry out its now well-developed policy." 1 1 "In Central America the aim has been to help such countries as Nicar agua and Honduras to help them selves," says President Taft. 'While they are the immediate bene ficiaries, the profit to the United States is two-fold, he adds, The Mon roe doctrine is more vital in the neighborhood of the Panama canal, and such countries should be relieved of the jeopardy of heavy foreign debts likely to provoke international com plications. The financial rehabilitation of these countries by American bankers and the protection of their customs houses from being the prey of would-be dic tators, says the president, would re move the menace of foreign creditors and revolutionary disorder. Further more the United States would profit largely in a business way through the development of the great natural resources of Central America. Commending the successful results of the application of the new neutral ity laws to Mexico and other troubled countries the president suggests that means be found in addition to pre vent the professional revolutionists' from making American 'ports "foci" for revolutionary intrigue. He reiterates his determination to adhere in the case of ;Mexico to the "patient policy of non-intervention, steadfast recog nition of constituted authority, and the exertion of every effort to pro tect American interests." Other paragraphs of the message point to the increase of American do mestic exports by $200,000,000 during the past year, malting the greatest total ever known, $2,200,000,000; to the agricultural credit system which he thoroughly endorsed, *to the prob able necessity of an amendment of the fur-seal act to permit limiting killing of seals; to a 'meeting, of the arbi trators in Washington next year to adjust the pecuniary claims between Great Britain and America; to nego tiations with Mexico for the distribu tion of the waters of the Colorado river in the Imperial valley section; and to the financial rehabilitation of Liberia. There is merely historical reference to the Chinese revolution; to thh San Domingan troubles, the rebellion in Cuba and the Balkan war develop ments, in which it is said the United States is not involved. The message concludes with an earnest appeal to congress to co-oper ate with the executive in its efforts to apply the old principles of diplomacy which have governed the country, to the anomentuous new situations of to day, when America finds itself at the threshold of her middle age as a na tion; "too mature to continue in its foreign relations those temporary ex pedienrts natural to a people to whom domestic affairs are the sole concern." 

JUDGE LYNCH DEFENDED BY BLEASE (Continued From Page One.) her northern sisters. It .is the cause of-most of those lynching cases which disgrace our civilization. It is to be kept down only by the severest meth ods. "It is too much to say that if the courts are not ready to deal effectiye ly with the crime, the people will. "The people 'who may thus bring some ruffian to his death will not be the best people in the community. They may occasionally seize' the wrohg man. But has a conviction ever yet been had in the United States of any one of a mob of lyncliers for hanging a negro accused of rape? "That crime does a wrong to a woman which many of them have deemed worse 'than death. Such a man is no fit subject for an inde terminate sentence. lHe has proved his inherent weakness of will power. In every clear case of rape, in my judgment, there should be an opera tion to produce sterilization." Governor Baldwin's address fol lowed an address by Governor Shaf roth of Colorado, in which Governor Shafroth advocated, lenient but cer tain: punishment to criminals, and cited his o*n state as an example where this system had worked well. Governor Shafroth declared that severe punishment, in his opinion, with an opportunity to shorten the ;sentence throiugh `labor and.good be havior, not ohly punished the crim inal, but served, also as a deterrment against future crimes and as an in centive to reform. Governor Donahghey of Arkansas declared -for a severe penalty for lynchers. No punishment other than death, he said, would deter murderers frorim crime. bEvery court of appeal should be aboalshed in the opinion of Governor' laberh.at of Minnesota.

"Much of actual value has been ac complished in previous conferences," Governor Norris said, "but the con ferences have not been the potent factor they should have been. No definite position has been taken upon any question and no fixed purpose has been accomplished. There seems to be no need for timidity on the part of the goversnors.

STATE BOARD WILL WAIT A WHILE (Continued on Page Six) favor of recommending the reports of the heads of the institutions as they had been received, but the majority thought it would be wiser and fairer to all the schools first to ascertain how much money will be available. Mr. Hall Talks. C. H. Hall returned from Helena on a midnight train. "I 1alieve that the educational institutions of the state should come before the state fair. the tuberculosis hospital and such things," he said. "We must educate our chil dren and there is no justice in letting our higher schools suffer. It Is not the fault of the state schools that the legislature has appropritated more money than the state hla to spenld. None of the inlstitutions directly con cerned has asked anything more than is its just due. The situation, of Course is unfortunate. I beleloe that education is of more importance than anything else and I believe that our schools should always be borne in mind. If the legislature would meet but 30 days, instead of G0, its mem hers could insure more money for the maintenance of public institutions, and accomplish just as much for Mon tana." President Craighead, after attending the meetings of the board of educa tion, went to Great Falls, where he is to speak before the University club. Professor L. C. Plant, who took Presi dent Craighead's report to Helena, re turned with Mr. Hall last night, THE
