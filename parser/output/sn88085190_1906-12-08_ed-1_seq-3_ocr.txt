CONGRESS MEETS FORMAL OPENING OF SHORT SES SION MONDAY. Little Work Expected to Be Done During Opening Week—Presi dents Message Tuesday-Out line of More Important Work Scheduled. Washintgon, Dec. B.—Both houses of congress convened at noon today, bnt notwithstanding a busy session is expected, practically no business was transacted the first day, and little is expected during the first week. It had been the hope that the legis lative, executive and judicial appro priation would be plaoed on the calen dar of the house as early as Tuesday, so that the beginning of the considera tion of the appropriations could be made almost contemporaneous, but the date of the presentation of the report has beea necessarily postponed, so that it is not probable that it will take plaec before Thursday. It is expected that the pension and fortification bills will be reported be fore Christmas, but not even the most sanguine members count upon their passage before that date. The senate is not counting on doing much the first week of the session, nor is the outlook there good for much strenuous labor until after the holi days. The reason for this is found in the desire to confine the work of the session largely to appropriation mea sures, and noae of those can be taken np by the senate until sent over from the house There is one item of gen eral legislation on the senate's calen dar of unfinished business, namely, Senator LaFollette's bill limiting the number of hours railway employes may be kept at work during each day, and the vote is set for January 10. The probabilities are that Senator La Follette will desire to discuss it, but it is not anticipated that even he will wish to take it up during the first few days of the session. The proceedings in both houses to day were of the most perfunctory character. They consisted of the routine business of appointing com mittees by each body to notify the other, and by both to notify the presi dent, and in the house of the call of the roll and the administration of the oath of office to the new members. After this proceeding the attention of the house was officially directed to the faot that four prominent members of that body, Messrs. Hitt, Hoar, Ket ch am and Adams have died since the close of the last session, and a motion for adjournment oat of respect for them immediately followed. Hear Message and Adjourn The president's message will not be received until tomorrow, and both houses will probably adjourn for the day as soon as it is read. It is expect ed the nomination of Attorney Gener al Moody to succeed Justice Brown on the supreme court bench will be made the first nomination to be sent in by the president, and there will be an effort to secure its immediate consid eration. There has not yet been timo for as general an exchange of views among members as is ordinarily desired by leaders before expressing their views, but all seem to regard the present sit uation as so simple as to need compar atively little intercourse to arrive at an understanding. That it will not be possible to do much on the appro priation bills before the holidays will have the effect of condensing the con sideration of the fourteen large supply measures into two months. Consider ing that the aggregate of the appro prations to be considered will approx imate a billion dollars, some senators and members express the opinion that congress cannot do better than give all ef its time to these measures. , The report on the shir subsidy bill probably will be an exception to the rule for bo general legislation. The friends of that measure have never been more insistent than now. They are extremely hopeful and yet very ap prehensive. The bill' has passed the senate and is in committee in the house. The committee heretofore has been very evenly divided, but the ad vocates of the bill believe that they will be able to get it out in due season, and they hope for its consideration when once reported to the house 1 Speaker Gannon has given no posi tive assurance as to his ■ attitude, j but the bill's supporters find encourage ment in his silence. One'incident that is very materially helping the sub sidy is the recent speech of Secretary Boot in support of the bilL v ~ The senate has on its calendar two important house bills the immigration bill and the Philippine tariff bill, but there are snags In the pathway of both of them. There is still intense opposi tion to the Philippine bill, especially as it is now believed that it cannot re vive serious consideration during the present short session.: -?-Cv?" y a y% ■ The session bids fair to be produo tive of man/ bills and also of much oratory. Not a few members of both now** are anxious ;to meet the de mands of bankers and others for a more elastic currency, and tt li qulU oertain that there will be efforts to •apply this want in the seastoa.

The Japanese question, the dis charge of the negro soldiers, the de sirability of an income tax law, the result of the late elections and the trusts are also slated for discussion, and it is even expected that some of them will receive oratorical attention from Democratic members as soon as the first appropriation bill is laid be fore the house. The increase of the navy will re ceive much consideration, but there is still opposition to the proposed ship of the Dreadnaught class. 

SAYS STATE COMMISSION EXCEEDED ITS POWERS Walla Walla, Dec. 7—Judge Thom as H. Brents of the superior court, holds that the state railroad commis sion has exceeded its powers in order ing rates changed throughout the state where a complaint has not been made as required by the law governing the commission. If this decision is upheld it will have the effect of knocking out the rates ordered by the commission. The decision was made in overruling the demurrer made by the state to the complaint filed by the railroad compa nies in whioh they asked for a writ of review of the proceedings held in Wal la Walla June 20 last. The complaint was filed by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, the Great North ern, the Northern Pacific and the Washington and Columbia railways. The railway commission has ten days in which to file an answer in the case. Every effort will be made to have it adjudicated by the supreme court before the legislature meets, in order that if it is finaly decided that the law does not give the commission the power to fix new rates, this power may be added. THIRTY STATES REPRESENTED Conference at Dea Moines for Direct Senatorial Election Dcs Moines, la., Deo. 3.—The gov ernors of more than thirty states have acoepted the invitation of lowa to ap point delegates to attend a conference at Dcs Moines this week to discuss ways and means to secure an amending of the federal oonstitucion giving the people the right to elect United States senators by direct vote. New York and the New England states are not among those whose gov ernors have said that they would ap point delegates. Gov. Higgins said that he bad no statutory authority to do so. Gov. Guild, of Massachusetts, pleaded a like disability. Other gov ernors interviewed advanced substan tially the same reason. Gov. Cummins and the lowa com missioners expect that more than 100 delegates will gather for the confer ence. Each state was invited to ap point five delegates Presumably all of the delegates will be of a single mind—in favor of the popular election of United States senators. The dis cussion in the conference will be then as to the method best suited to achieve the desired constitutional amendment. It has been suggested that to call a constitutional convention might be dangerous. Once called, its powers would not be limited. It might assail the constitution in many points—rela tive to divorce, interstate commerce and many other important subjects. To seoure the amendment in the usual manner, by congressional sub mission to the states for legislative ratification, requires the co-operation of about 84 states, and these, it is be lieved, can be induced to join. To Grow Their Own Cotton New Orleans, Dec. B.—lt has been announced by Col. F. M. Welch, in charge of the Gould system immigra tion bureau in this city, that the rep resentatives of the Lancashire and Manchester Cotton Spinners' Associa tion, who have just completed a tour of the ootton belt, practically have de cided to purchase a 5,000 acre tract of ootton land each in Louisiana and Mississippi, with a view to raising and shipping cotton to their own mills in Lancashire. By the handling of cot-, ton direct from the farms, the English-; men believe they can eliminate the middlemen. No Can to Move Oranges Visalia, Gal., Deo. 4— mass meet ing of indignant orange growers was held at Lindsay Ito devise ways and means to iodaoe the Southern Pacific company to furnish ears for the trans portation of oranges to the Eastern | markets. The meeting was largely at tended. The car shortage was consid ered and it was the unanimous opinion that the railroad company had no ex com or its failure to handle the busi ness offered. A oomnifttee was ap :pointed to secure legal ad*Jce and consider the proposition of taking the matter before the interstate oommeroe eqMKtaioa. T« ***— V»e k imtrml Cndm i * Waeaiaiton Deo.

School Board and Federal Dis trict Attorney Agree on Ques tions to Be Submitted—Action Inspired By Secretary of State Root. San Francisco, Deo. 7.—ln accord ance with instructions received from Attorney General Moody, District At torney Robert Devlin has held a con ference in his office with President Aaron Alt mann, of the board of edu cation; City Attorney William G. Bnrke and Assistant City Attorneys William Bagget and John Williams to discuss the exclusion of the Japan ese from schools attended by white children, with a view to arranging a suit to test the state statute which re quires the segregation of children of Mongolian parentage in separate schools. Proceedings technically known as a "controversy without ac tion," will be brought either in the supreme oourt of California or in a federal oourt. The points in dispute were practically agreed upon at the conference, but the drafting of the statement of facts was postponed for a day or two. Mr. Devlin will in the meantime communicate with Attorney General Moody as to whether the pro ceedings shall be brought in the su preme court of the state or in one of the federal courts in this district. He intimated that unless he is instructed to the contrary he will ask the highest tribunal of the state for a decision. Treaty in Question Mr. Devlin said that the whole issue resolves itself into the question of whether the state statute is in viola tion of the treaty rights of Japan. He is of the opinion that the law discrim inates against the Japanese, inasmnch as German, Irish and other citizens of foreign descent are not segregated in separate schools, whereas the treaty with Japan guarantees the Japanese equal rights and privileges with aliens from other lands. It is on this basis that the United States district attorney is proceeding, and as only the points agreed upon will be submitted, an early decision is expected from the courts. Inspired by Secretary Root Washington, Deo. 7.—lnquiry dis closes the faot that the legal proceed ings to be taken in San Francisco in the matter of the admission of Japan ese to the public schools of that city without discrimination, were inspired by Secretary Root, who expressed the opinion that it will be one way to effectually dispose of the controversy. That the president's views met with the hearty approavl' of the Japanese government was made apparent when Viscount Aoki, the Japanese ambassa dor, stated that he had personally thanked the president for what he had said. 

PRESIDENT NAMES CABINET MEMBERS Washington, Dec. 4.—Seven cabinet changes and one appointment to the supreme bench were sent to the sen ate yesterday by President Roosevelt, but they were not confirmed in ac cordance with the general custom con cerning snob, important nominations. It is said that there is no opposi tion to the appointees for the cabinet and, to the nomination of the attorney general, William H. Moody, to be as sociate justice of the supreme court, despite the fact that it ws determined to refer these nominations to the com mittee for report. '1 The reason t advanced for the delay is that no message of any character had been received from the president and therefore it would hot be proper to transact business. The important nominations follow: Secretary of I the treasury—George B. Cortelyou. .. n . r ' Attorney General—Charles J. Bona parte. Postmaster General—George Yon L.

PRESIDENTS ANNUAL NESSA6E TO CONGRESS Continued from page 2. marily the seaboard states, Buch as Maine, Louisiana and Washington; but what benefits part of our people in the end benefits all; just as government aid to irrigation and forestry in the west is really of benefit, not only to the Rocky lmountain states, but to all our country. If it prove impracticable to enact a law for the encouragement of shipping generally, then at least provision should be made for better communication with South America notably for fast mail lines to the chier South American ports. It is discred itable to us that our business people, for lack of direct communication in the shape of lines of steamers with South America, should in that great continent be at a disadvantage com pared to the business people of Europe. Currency Law. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has able served a great purpose in aiding the enormous business devel opment of the country; and within ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating that additional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, be cause to leave them as they are means to incur liability of business disaster. Insular Possessions. I most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or else ab solute free trade in Philippine prod ucts will become a law. No harm will come to any American industry; and while there will be some small but real material benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit will come by the showing made as to our purpose to do all in our power for their welfare. American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan in Porto Rico should be dredged and improved. The expense of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. The administration of the affairs of Porto Rico, together with those of the Philippines, Hawaii, and our other insular possessions, should all be directed under one executive department; by preference the depart ment of state or the department of war. The needs of Hawaii are pecuiar; every aid should be given the islands; and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the lines of a com munity of small freeholders, not of great planters with coolie-tilled es tates. Situated as the territory is, in the middle of the Pacific, there are duties imposed upon this small com munity which do not fall in like de gree or manner upon any other Amer ican community. This warrants our treating it differently from the way in which we treat territories contigu ous to or surrounded by sister terri tories or other states, and justifies the setting aside of a portion of our revenues to be expended for educa tional and internal improvements therein. Hawaii is now making an ef fort to secure immigration fit in the end to assume the duties and burdens of full American citizenship, and when ever the leaders in the various indus tries of those islands finally adopt our ideals and heartily join our adminis tration in endeavoringto develop a middle class of substantial citizens, a way will then be found to deal with the commercial and industrial prob lems which now appear to them so serious. The best Americanism is that which aims for stability and per manency of prosperous citizenship, rather than immediate returns on large masses of capital. The A.-V.-P. Exposition. Alaska's needs have been partially met, but there must be a complete reorganization of the governmental system, as I have before indicated to you. I ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow citizens who dwell on the shores of Puget Bound with characteristic energy are arranging to hold in Seattle the Alaska-Yukon-Pa cific exposition. Its special aims in clude the upbuilding of Alaska and the , development of American commerce lon the Pacific ocean. This exposition/ in its purposes and scope, should ap peal not only to the people of the Pa-' cific slope, but to the people of the United States at large. Alaska since it was bought has yielded to the gov ernment 111,000,000 of revenue and ; has produced nearly $300,000,000 in gold, furs and fish. When properly developed it will become in large de gree a land of homes. The countries bordering the the Pacific ocean have a population more numerous than- that of all the countries of Europe; their annual foreign commerce amounts to over $3,000,000,000, of which the share of the United States Is some $700,000, --000. If this trade were thoroughly un derstood and pushed ?by our manufac turers and producers, the industries not only of the Pacific slope, but of all; our country, and particularly of •ur cotton, growing states, .would be greatly benefited. Of course, in order Ito get these, benefits, we must treat fairly the countries with which *we trade. -->v'-;*:'"K-';i-'i%-..-' :..'. "■■ ■'<!■ Treatment of Japanese.

To remember this is incumbent on every American citizen, and it is of course peculiarly incumbent on ev ery government official, whether of the nation, or of the Beveral state*. I am prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there as sumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility is sporadic and is limited to a very few places. Nevertheless, it is most discreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught with the gravest consequences to the nation. The friendship between the United States and Japan has been continuous since the time, over half a century ago, when Commodore Per ry, by his expedition to Japan, first opened the islands to western civili zation. Since then the growth of Japan has been literally astounding. There is not only nothing to parallel it, but nothing to approach it in the history of civilized mankind. Japan has a glorious and ancient past. Her civilization is older than that of the nations of northern Europe—the na tions from whom the people of the United States have chiefly sprung. But 50 years ago Japan's development was still that of the middle ages. Dur ing that 50 years the progress of the country in every walk in life has been a marvel to mankind, and she now stands as one of the greatest civilized nations; great in the arts of war and in the arts of peace; great in military, in industrial, or artistic development and achievement. Our nation fronts on the Pacific, just as it fronts on the Atlantic. We hope to place a constantly growing part in the great ocean of the Orient. We wish, as we ought to wish, for a great commercial development in our deal ings with Asia; and it is out of the question that we should permanently have such development unless we free ly and gladly extend to other nations the same measure of justice and good treatment which we expect to receive in return. It is only a very small body of our citizens that act badly. Where the federal government has power it will deal summarily with any such. Where the Beveral states have power I earnestly ask that they also deal wisely and promptly with such con duct, or else this small body of wrong doers may bring shame upon the great mass of their innocent and right-think- ing fellows —that is, upon our nation as a whole. Good manners should be an international no less than an indi vidual attribute. I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would ask fair treatment for Germans or English men, Frenchmen, Russians, or Ital ians. I ask it as due to humanity and civilization. I aßk it as due to our selves because we must act upright toward all men. Naturalize Japanese. I recommend to congress that an act be passed specifically providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become Amer ican citizens. One of the great em- barrassments attending the perform ance of our international obligations 1b the fact that the statutes of the United States are entirely inadequate. They fail to give to the national gov ernment sufficiently ample power, through United States, courts and by the use of the army and navy, to pro tect aliens in the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore ear nestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to as to en able the president, acting for the United States government, which is responsible in our international rela tions, to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties. Conditions in Cuba. Last August an insurrection broke j out in Cuba which it speedily grew evident that the existing Cuban gov ernment was powerless to quell. This government was repeatedly asked by the then Cuban government to inter vene, and finally was notified by the president of Cuba that he Intended to resign; that his decision was irrevoc able; that none of the other constitu tional officers would consent to carry the government, and that he was pow erless to maintain order. • • *. Thanks to the preparedness of our navy, I was able Immediately to send enough ships, to Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless; and I furthermore dispatched to Cuba the secretary of war and , the assistant secretary of rstate, in order that they might I grapple with the situation on the ground. All efforts to t secure an agreement 'between 1 the contending factions, by which they should them selves come to an amicable under standing and settle upon some modus —some provisional government of their own—failed. 5 Finally the pres ident of the .- republic resigned. - The quorum of congress assembled failed by deliberate purpose 1 of its ', members, so that there was no power .to act on his resignation, and the government came to ' a * halt. ■•In I accordance with the so-called Platt amendment, which was embodied in the constitution of Cuba, I | thereupon proclaimed a pro visional government for the Island, the secretary of war acting as provisional governor until he could be replaced by Mr. Magoon, the late minister to Pan ama and governor of the canal sone on the isthmus;' troops were sent to support them and to relieve the navy, the expedition beta* handled with satisfactory speed and efficiency.

It is interesting to observe that in the successive conferences which have been held the representatives of the different American nations have been learning to work together effectively, for, while the first conference in Wash ington in 1889, and the second confer ence In Mexico in 1901-2, occupied many months, with much time wasted in an unregulated and fruitless dis cussion, the third conference at Rio exhibited much of the facility in the practical j dispatch of business which characterizes permanent deliberative bodies and completed its labors within the period of six weeks originally al lotted for its session. I have just returned from a trip to Panama and shall report to you at length later on the whole subject of the Panama canal. Hague Conference. In my last message I advised you that the emperor of Russia had taken the initiative in bringing about a sec ond peace conference at The Hague. Under the guidance of Russian the arrangement of the preliminaries for such a conference has been progress ing during the past year. Progress has necessarily been slow, owing to the great number of countries to be consulted upon every question that haa arisen. It is a matter of satisfac tion that all of the American repub lics have now, for the first time, been invited to join in the proposed confer ence. It must be kept in mind that war is not merely justifiable, but imper ative, upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace can only be obtained by the Bacriflce of conscientious conviction or of national welfare. Strength of Navy. The United States navy Ib the sur est guarantor of peace which : this country possesses. It is earnestly to be wished that we would profit by the teachings of . history in this matter. A strong and wise people will Btudy its own failures no less than its tri umphs, - for ' there is wisdom to be learned from the study of both, of the mistake as well as of the Buccesß. For this purpose nothing could ; be more instructive than a rational ' study of war of 1812, as it is told, for Instance, by Capt. Mahan. There was only one way in which that war could have been avoided. If during the preced ing twelve years a navy relatively as has had been built up, and an army provided relatively as good las that which the country now has, there nev er would have been the slightest nec essity of fighting the war; and if the strong as that which this country now necessity had arisen the war would under such circumstances have ended with our Bpeedy and overwhelming triumph. But our people during those twelve years refused to make and preparations whatever, regarding eith er the army or navy. They saved a million or two of dollars by so doing; and In mere money paid a hundred fold for each million they thus saved during the three years of war which., followed—a war which brought untold suffering upon our people, which at one time , threatened the gravest na tional disaster, and which, in spite of the necessity of waging it, resulted merely in what was in effect a drawn, battle, while the balance of defeat and triumph was almost even. I do net ask that we continue to increase our navy, I ask merely that It be maintained at its present strength; and this i can be done ; only if we re place the obsolete and outworn ship* by new and good ones, the equals of any afloat in any navy. To stop build ing ships for one year means that for that year the navy goes back instead of forward, i: >>v: (^V4.»" Must Shoot Straight . n The congress has most; wisely., pro vided for a atonal board torthe pro motion of rifle practice.
