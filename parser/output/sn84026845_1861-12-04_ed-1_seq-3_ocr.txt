THE NEW STATE AND SLAVERY. [For the Intelligence.J The Convention appointed to form a Constitution for the proposed New State, lias met, and fully organized, and is pro ceeding with the business before it The subject of slavery has not yet fully come before the Convention; it will, however, claim a full and thorough in vestigation before ^ that body. But how it will finally be disposed of, is not cer tainly known. Some of the members are for a slave State; are for incorporating slavery into the Constitution as a part of the organic law of the State. Others are for a free State, the Constitution prohibiting sla very forevor after a specified time fixed ; by the Convention;'and again, there are others who are for leaving the wholo sub ject of slavery out of the Constitution, and committing it to ' the Legislature of the State. All, however, agree that the New State must and will be free ulti mately. This whole subject in my judgement should turn upon the question: Is sla very a blessing, or is it a curse f There I can be no.middle ground; it is one or the othrr. If slavery tends to the peaco, prosperity and happiness of a people and nation; if it tends to the general good of humanity, then let the New State be a slave State. But if the reverse are the tendencies of slavery; if bitter strifes and discord at home, and burning re proach abroad, and civil war and blood shed, be its legitimate results, then let the New State be made j\rfree State. This whole subject should be frankly and thoroughly discussed by the Con vention, that wise and just conclusions may bo arrived nu This is not the time for shrinking from responsibilities; Jet the issue be firmly met It is very gen erally admitted, that the whole system of American slavery is founded and perpet uated wrongtoppressidiC?1&bg Tadatioit'^rueUy and inhumanity. How, then, can it be attended with the bless ings of heaven? Henry Clay said, "Sla very is a curse to the master and a griev ous wrong to the slave." Thomas Jeffer son holds that there is no attribute in the Godhead that Sympathises with American slavery, and expresses himself as trem bling for the fate of this nation on ac count of slavery. Dr Ilenry Ruffner, of Kanawha, a pro found scholar and a slaveholder himself, and who is thoroughly acquainted with tho subject, in his "Address to the people of West Virginia," on the subject of sla very, referring to its desolating effects upon the old slave States, says: "What has done this work of desolation? Not war, nor pestilence; not oppression of ru lers, civil or ecclesiastical; but slavery, a curse more destructive in its effects than any of them." Itrriblc must tho curse of slavery be in his estimation?worse, even, than war, and God knows that is bad enough. "Our own Western Virginia," says he, "furnishes conclusive evidenco that slave ry, in all quantities and degrees, has a per nicious influence on public welfare. It is a truth, a certain trath, that slavery drives free laborere, farmers, mechanics, and all, and some of the best of them, too, out of the country, nnd fills their places with ne groes." Referring to tho evil effects of shivery upon the Vallev of Virginia, Dr. Ruffner says, "What a pity that so rich and so lovely a land should be afflicted with this yellow fever and this black vomit." How dreadfnl must the curse of slavery be, if.it Is tbe "yeltoio lever and black vom it" combined. Again, 44Slavery is demonstrated to be not <jt\ly unprofitable, but deeply injurious to the public welfare." "Some Virginia politicians proudty?yes, proudly, fellow citizens, call our old com monwealth the Mother of States 1 These en lightened patriots might pay her a still high er compliment, by calling her the Grand mother of States. For our part, \rc are grieved and mortified, to think of the lean and haggard condition ol our venerable mother. Ho black children have sacked her so dry, that now, for a long time past, the has not milk enough for her offspring, either black or white." If this were true of Virginia twenty-four years ago, is it not more terribly true now? Two grand armies have invaded her terri tory, nnd have drenched her soil with the blood of her own citizens?desolation and. ruin reigning with horror in her midst.? What a spectacle does the Old Dominion present. Seemingly, she is under the curse of God nnd man. What is the cause of all this ? What has brought about this terrible state of things? I answer, is net slavery the cause of it ?? Has not slavery formed this dark and deeply laid conspiracy for the overthrow of this great Republic ? ' Is It aot the Cataline that that is seeking to destroy our glorious country? Who will for a moment doubt this? Certainly, no one. But what shall be done with slavery?? Treat it as any other traitor?let it be exe cuted. Provide for its utter extirpation. The jnrispradence of Moses, the divine haw-giver, furnishes the principle govern ing this question: "But if theox were wont to push with his horns in times past, it hath been testified to his owner, and be hath not kept him in, bat that he h&th killed a man or a woman ^ the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall he put to death." This Ox, this Bull of Slavery, farious, <k*perate, is plunging his horns to the very ! beirt of this nation, and seeking its utter j destruction. Already, his horos are red with hnmaa gore, and the hairs of his-'body are drippiug with the blood of our best citizens. Blood and carnage, wealth des troyed and desolation, mark the maddened career of this furious beast. Shall this monster ???be stoned to death?" We as a people and nation are responsible. If we refuse to provide for the exterpation andre taovat of this great evil, can wo hope to ?e crowned with prosperity, and the bless* ,Dg ot Him in whosQ hands are the desti nies of nations and republics. Let Wes tern Virginia nobly do her part. ... 1.83J* Western Virginia straggled hard that the whole Slate should be freed of jyei, but the power of Eastern Virginia a*featedthe measure,and there it has rest ed. Bat note Western Virginia can be a Sl?te,'if a State at all.

The Jews were permitted to purchas servants of the heathen, and such persoi* as were thus purchased became their sei rants forever. Captive* taken in war wim ? placed in the same couditton uf servitude From this fact it hits been argued tlmt tl. bible sustains the kind of slavery that i-~ conimon in all the Southern States o of our once happy but now distracted land. In reflecting on the subjec, we should bo careful to distinguish between the abuses of the law or system of laws and the ne cessary results of their operations; and al 80 between the system of laws by which serritnde was regulated among the Jews, and those by which it is reguiuted in our midst. And besides this we must not for get that we are now living under the New Testament law, and that this is the rule by which the old is to be interpreted. Oar system of slavery is opposed to the Bible in at least three of its most important features. 1. The Bible teaches that husband and wife are not to be separated, so that either may again marry, except on the ground of adultry, but our law allows the master to separate husband and wife at his own pleasure. He may send the one to Alabama and the other to Texas and either may again marry, so far as the law is concerned. Here we have not only a breach of the ordinance of marriage, but a system of po- , lygamy as real, if not as public as that in existence in Utah. It is as really a part of it, as the arm is a part of the human body. I kuovr that all right minded men among slaveholders avoid tbls abomination ua far as possible, and condemn it very sincerely; but this don't change the system. If the slaveholder diea intestate, or foils in busi ness, how can the sale of his slaves to the j highest bidder be prevented? Many a , bitter tenr has been shed by the alavo ; owner and his family, when compelled to j aTIow their slaves to be sold; but their j tears could neither prevent the sale nor wash away the sin of separating huaband and wife, parents and children. This is one of the corner stones in the boasted foundation or society at the South I 2. The Bible makes it both the duty and the privilege of all people to ''search the Scriptures." All Protestants, at least, agree on this point. But in order to be able to "search the Scriptures," the slave must be able to read; yet our system for bids this. Even here in Wheeling it is an offence against the laws of the State to teach a negro to read. Christ said "search the Scriptures," but our slave code says. No, if you obey Christ in this matter, you shall be subject to Sue aud imprisonment! It is true that slaves are permitted to enjoy some religious privileges. They have congregations of their own, and large numbers are allowed iu some places to attend the same churches in which their masters worship. To the credit of many slaveholders, be it said, tbey go just as far as they dare go, in giving religions instruc tion to their servants j bat this does noi remove the foul olot from the system, and make it consistent with the teachings ol the Bible. 3. The bible condemns oppressions bo frequently and so sternly, that its mean ing cannot well be misapprehended; but our system ot slavery, by giving to the master the absolute control of the time and person of the slave, legalises almost any amount of oppression the master may flee proper to iuflict. Masters may avoid this, from interest or from the dictates of hu manity, and may spurn with utter contempt the creature that would take advantage of this law, but this does not obliterate the law, nor reconcilo it with the declarations of the bible. So long as the law protects men in acts of oppression, so long will there be men found who ore degraded enough to take advantage ot its protection to gratify their malevolent passions. These are not abuses of the system of slavery. They are parts of the system it self. If laws were enacted to protect the marriage relation, and the relatiou ot pa rents and children?to give to the slave the advantage of education?and to^ guarantee to him the enjoyment of his inalienable rights as a liuraau being?the system would ( be radically changed ; and until this is done our slave laws must remain a God dishonoring blot on our nation's name. ObSBBVEB. FROM CAMP ELK WATER. How the Second Virginia Regiment is Getting On. Gamp Elkwater, Va., 1 Nov, 26th. 1861. / Ed*. Intel:?Having nothing else to do, I drop you a few lines from the 2d Vir ginia. This regiment is still stationed nt tbc fortifications, whilst the 3d and 6th Ohio have left here for the seat of war iu Kentucky, together with the 15tU and 17th Indiana. I learn that the 13th Indiana left Hnttonville this evening, supposed for same destination. Gen. Millroy is still at Cheat Mountain Pass, with three of four regiments. We are anxiously looking for marching orders to join Gen. Kelle7's command.? Thought we may not better our condition, still a march or change from here would give great satisfaction to all concerned to get rid of the ennui which opresses all in camp. I have just learned that the rebels at , Greenbrier have evacuated that place, i Where they have gone we cannot find out, though Gen. M. has a cavalry company I following them up. I think that the rea sonable inference is, that the rebsls at that place are now marching to Winchester, where, from what we can learn, they in tend giving Gen. Kelley battle; hence we are anxious to join his command. Major Pumphrey has jnst finished pay ing off the 2d Virginia, and will commence paying the 7th Indiana to-morrow. Major Bell, some time since, whilst ou; foraging with two of three companies Iron, the pass, nnd being slightly intoxicated, mounted hts baglef behind him and sound; ed a charge. Away they went, pell mell. right up to the rebel works, throwing them in a terrible state of excitement* They supposed it the advanced guard o. of oar army. He lost two men and some fiir or six wounded, for which attempt ho i> now under arrest. Some of the Regiments have built or ar '? building winter quarters, but owing to tb inclemency of the weather and the expect ed marching orders, the work is now al most sespeaded. It is now snowing hard with aome five e. six Inches of snow already on tbc ground, and most of the men still occupying the!* tents.

The Convention wa* opened with pray er by R** j. I,, ci*rk, of Wheeling, of the M. K Olmr. il. .Minutes read mid approved. Mr. Stbwaht of Doddridge, from the j Committee on Boundary, presented the re port of that Committee, which was laid upon the table and ordered to be printed. ? ?Messrs. Soper, Parsons, Trainer and Huymond offered documents containing provisions, which were referred tothecom inittees without reading. Mr. Stkvenson of Wood called up the special order of the day, which was the consideration of the report of the Com mittee on Printing andFxpenditure, in re lation to having the debates officially re ported and published. Mi^Vam Winkle moved that the Com mittee be authorized to contract for the reporting and publishing of the debates of the Convention, and made some remarks in favor of the project; in explaining the pro priety and necessity of it; and in showing that it was usnal in such Conventions, and was an expense as entirely necessary and proper us any they wonld incur. He was followed by Mr. Pomeroy, who fully seconded his remarks. The motion was agreed to. Mr. Van Utinklc then called up the first report of the Committee on Fundamental and Government Provisions. The reporL was taken up and the first section read. Mr. Sinsml moved to strike out of tbig section the word "Kanawha" as the name of the new state, and assigned his reasons for doing so. He was followed by Mr. Purker who was also in favor of the motion. A'taflgthy dUcuaaloa sprang Ud in which. Messrs, Brown'of *Atfawha,- WtoBMT Lamb and Paxton, opposed the motion to change the name, while Messrs. Sinsel, Parker, Powell, Traner, Mahon, Caldwell, Willey, Lauck and Stewart of Doddridge, addressed the Convention in favor of the motion to strike out the name of Kanawha. Their chief reasou was that their constitu ents were almost to a man dissatisfied with it, nnd in obedience to their expressed wishes felt bound to have it changed. The gentlemen on the other hand argued that in the first place they had no author ity to make a change, as the ordinance had been adopted by the people with the name of Kanawha incorporated, and that to change that would be a dangerous prece dent, and wonld equally authorize them to change anything else enacted by the ordi nance; and further that as the adoption of that name by the August Convention was the result of a fair compromise, to take advantage of the present opportunity and chauge it would be acting in bad faith. The discussion lasted until the honr of I P. M., when the Convention took a recess without a rote on the motion to strike out. AtTTKRXOOX

Laws shall be enacted in the uame of the State of West Virginia. Indictments shall concludc 'against the peace and dignity of the State of West Virginia/ '* The third and fonrth sections were read aud adopted as foBow : "Sec. 3.

On nf'iUoti of Hr. n est, the resolution of Mr. West in regard to the Sergeant at Arms was taken up. The resolution sets forth that the former Sergeaut-at-Arms has received an appointment in the army, and the object of the resolution was to test the question whether the Sergeant-at Arms oould fill the position by an as sistant. Mr. Wilson, of Ohio, said that he could see no pointln the resolution. It was no matter he thought for the consideration of the House. Mr. Wbst re-atated that the question which he desired to be dccided was simply whether Mr. Fogle, the Sergeaut-at-Aruis, could fill the position by an assistant? whether ne was legitimately entitled io hold the position. The Spbakbr remarked that the resolu tion was Indefinite, and that its adoption would decide nothing. Mr. West then moved that the resolution be laid upon the table. By Mr. Boreman:?

It was well known that Mr. Llnsley's main object was for the beuefit of the poor and not as a money making business of teachers and the benefit of the rich. Your obedient servant, Johx MoLurb.

A Gooa Appoiktmm*.?We learn that the Governor has commissioned William Tomer, (old Bill Turner) of Wayne county, to raise an independent scouting company to do service ia and along: the Big Sandy and elsewhere. Cap;. Turner was taken as a prisoner from his home in the early stages of the rebellion and kept for some time at Wayne court house, and ever since his release be has been doing good service in his neighbor hood by scouting the country and amazing the rebels?fighting on his own hook. He is a man of great detertninion and known personal brarery-a man who is greatlylov ed by his friends and cordially hated by his enemies. Poor of the prisoners who were brought up from Wayne county the other day and who were afterwards released through the solcitations of Union men, have already volunteered in Gapt. Turner's company as an evidence of their good faith. OOP* Mobe Pbisoxfrs?Attack cpox Tbaxs.?Capt.

Other than this, there is nothing new in Romney. flSfAn Unfortunate Mistake ?On Monday night officer Lancaster's attention was called to a suspicious sort of a char acter, supposed to be a woman dressed in boys clothes. The officer, after watching the movements of the party for some time, concluded io arrest if, and took it before Aid. Macmanaway. The officer asked that bis charge be committed to jail for sailing under false colors, The party denied the churga so earnestly, that the officer, after :i brief observation, satisfied * himself that it was really a boy, and accordingly turned the effeminate little fellow loose to go on his way again crying. jB^*Geiueral Rosecbaxs Coming.?Capt, Downing, of the Quarter Master's Depart ment received a dispatch last night from Gen.

Mr. Maynard presented the credentials of Mr Clemen s, represented ve elect from the 4th District of Tennessee He briefly related the circumstances under which the election was held, saying threo members were elected in East Tennessee; men who de clare for tbe National Constitution and for the Bag under which they bad lived and under which they had hoped to die. He spoke of the difficulties attending travel, which prevented them from reaching Wash* mgton to attend the extra session. On motion, tbe credentials were referred to tbe Committee on Elections. The President's message was received at a few minutes after noun, and was read. On motion of Mr. Washburne, of III.. tbe message of the President was referred to the Committee of tbe Whole on the State of the Union. Mr. Wash home's motion for printing 50,000 extra copies, was referred to tbe Committee on Printing. Mr. Dunn offered the following: Wubbbas, Henry C. Burnett, a member of the House from Kentucky, is in open tebellion against tbe Government of tbe United States, therefore. Resolved, That the said Burnett be, and he is hereby expelled from this House, and the Governor of Kentucky be notified of bis expulsion. Resolved, That tbe Seigeant-at-Arms be directed not to pay Burnett's salary which has accrued since the close of the extra session. Mr. Wickllffe, of Ky., said he bad In tended to prepare and submit a proposition scmetbiog like an obituary notice of bis late colleague. [Laughter.] Tbe latter was not as the resolution asserted in a mere rebellion, but beads a provisional govern ment^ Kentuoky, a revolutionary conven tion not satisfied with tbe treatment of this government to maintain tbe Union, nor satisfed jvith the course of his own stat6,-he has assumed the important duty of organizing another government for the better protection of tbe lives, property and liberty of the people of Kentucky, and In thid undertaking he has employed Simon Buckner, who is not only somewhat as similate in name, but tbe dead* of Simon Girty, who once headed tbe Indians in Kentucky. Three times has the gallant state of Kentucky declared by overwhelm ing majorities that she would not leave the United States to run after strange gods, or for the so called Southern Confederacy and to relieve them from despotism and to pro tect ther rights. Ab we were deceived, we were told by tbe executive of this so called Southern Confederacy, that it was intended to respect the condition of Ken tucky. which it was pretended would not be done by the government of the United States. The Union men of Kentucky never did deny the right of the United States Gov ernment to occupy its soil for the exercise of tbe purposes imposed by the Constitu tion. Kentucky had acknowledged her obligations, and expressed her determina tion to fulfill them. The proclamation of the Governor of Kentucky deceived the people, but the Legislature denounced It. Two messengers of pcacc were sent to the Executive of the United States, and one to tbe President of the Southern Gov ernment to know what was intended to be done with Kentucky. Tbe former said it was intended to maintain the laws and the Constitution of tbe United States, and that this was believed to be tbe will of the peo ple of Kentucky. The latter declared that be intended to yespect tbe neutrality of Kentucky, as understood bv the secession party in that State; but tbe Southern press did not tell them that he bad matured i a plan to assail them at three different points. Nor did be tell tbein there was on ' the statute book of tbe Southern govern* ! merit a law providing money and means not to sustain Kentucky agninst oppres sion, but to carry her into the Southern Confederacy against tbe majority of two tbirds of the entire State. | fThe provisional governor of Kentncky was sent to see the government at Rich mond. Meanwhile Mr. Burnett was at the head of tbo new order of affairs in tbe dis charge of his duty, and an armed force had been gathered, composed of young, desper ate and reckless men, commanded by Buckner. To conclusion, ilr. Wickliffe said, with the blessing of God. f predict that iy tbe 25tb of Demceinber no hostile foot will be found on tbe soil of Kentucky. Ap planse. The resolution for the expulsion of Mr. Burnett was adopted. On motion of Mr. Stratton, of New Jsrsey, a resolution was adopted, allow ing Mr. Verree, the member from tbe Third District of Pennsylvania, three days to take testimony before tbe Recorder in Philadelphia, nearly tho whole time allow, ed by law baying been similarly consum ed by Mr. Kline, who contests bis seat.? Adjourned.

Dupont, and through him to the of ficers, seamen and^ marines'attached to tbe squadron under his command, for the de cisive and splendid victory achieved at Port Royal on the 7th day of November last. >Jr. Grimes said be bud no doubt every Senator was prepared to vote for tbe reso lution now, but tbe best course to pursne was perhaps to uct in accordance with pre cedent and refer tbe resolution to the Com mittee on Naval Affairs. Tbe resolution was then laid aside until the formation of the standing committees. . Mr. Poster gave notice of bis iotention to introduce a bill, supplementary to the act to authorise protection to be given to citizens of the United States who may dis cover devosits of guano, approved August, 1856.
