Ido not o%tnte Uiis. iuconsidcratol}'- At the same ratio df ihoreßßo which we have maintained on an averago from our first National census, in 1790, until tlsat of 1850, we should in 1900 have a population of 103,208,415 and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period! Our abundant room, our broad National Homc ttead, is our ample resource. Were onr territory as limited as are the Brit ish Isles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instend of receiving the foreign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native born away. But such is not our condition. Wo have '2,963,000 square miles. Europe has 3,800,000 with a population averaging 73 J persons to the square mile. Why may not our country at some time average as many! Is it less fertile? Ilns it Xiorc waste surface by mountains, rivers, Uf.cs deserts or other cause? Is it inferior to Eu rope in any natural advantage ? If then we are at some time to be as prosperous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may bo we can judge by the past and the present. As to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union. Several of our States arc above the average of Europe 73 Jto the square mile. Massachu setts has 157, Rhode Island 133, Connecticut 99, New York and New Jersey each 80. Also, the two other great States of Pennsylvania and Ohio are not far below, the former having 03 and the latter 59. The States already above the European average, except New York, havo increased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before, while no one of them is •qnai to some other parts of our country in natural capacity for sustaining a dense popula tion. Taking the nation in the aggregate, and wa find the population and ratio ot increase for the several decennial periods to be as follows.' 1790—3929,827. 1800—5,301,987; 31.02 per cent of increase. 1810—-5,239,814; 36.15 per cent, ratio of in crease 1820—9,633,131 ; 33 31 per cent. " " 4830—12,866,020 33.49 " " " 1849—17,01)9,458; 32.67 " " " 1859—23,191,876; 35.87 " " " 1860-31,443,799; 35.59 " " " Tliis shows an average decennial increase ot 81 69 per cent in population through tlio sev enty ycaas from our first to our hist census yet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase at one of the seven periods is either 2 per oenl below, or 2 per cent, above the average, thus showing how inflexiblo and consequently how reliable the law of increase in "ir ease is Assuming tl> A will cotiUuue, it gives the following results: 1870, 42,323,372; 1880,56,966,216 ; 1890, 76,677,872; 1900,103,208,415; 1910,138,- 818,526; 1920, 480,984,335; 1930, 251,688,- 914. These figures show that our coantry may he M populous as Europe. Now, at some point between 1829 and 1830, say about 1825, our territory nt IS if parsons to the square mile be ing of the capacity to contain 217,180,000, and we will reach this too, if wo do not our selves, relinquish the chances by the folly and evils of disunion, or by long and exhausting wars, springing from the only great element of nation al discord among us. While it cannot bo iotc secn exactly how much one huge example of se cession, breeding lesserones, i nde_fini tsl)j, Jftppy IKlti jlilillli would shorten the war, perpetuate ' iwoe* ; - u - increase ot population and proportionately the wealth of the country.— With these wo ought to pay all the emancipa tion would cost, together with our other debts, easier titan we should pay our other debt with out it. If wc had allowed our old National debt to run at G per cent, per annum simple interest from the end of our revolutionary struggle un til to-day without paying nnythiug on either principle or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than eucli man owed then. This is because our increase of man through the whole period has been greater than six per cent., has run faster tluie the interest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves the debtor so long as its populating increases faster than the uupail interest accumulates upon its debt. This fact would be no excuse for delaying the payment of what is justly duo, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection The great advantage of the policy by which we shall not have to pay until wc number one hundred millions what wo would have to pay now when wc number but thirty-one millions. To a word, it shows that a dollar will bo much harder to pay for the war, than will bo a dol lar for emancipation on the proposal plan.— And then the latter will cost no blood, no pre cious life. It will be a saving of both. As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them, doubtless in the property sense, belong to loy al owners, and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such. The third article retatos to the future of the frood, people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regard ed as objectionable, on the oue hand or on the other, inasmuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people so de ported, and the American voters, through their representatives in congress. I cannot make it better kuown thau it alrea dy is that I strongly favor colonizattoo, and yet liyisli to say there is an objection urged n gainsl free colored persons remaining in the country, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious. It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace -white la- Dor and white laborers. If there ever could a proper timo for catch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through timo and •in eternity. Is it true that the colored people can (fisplaco any more white labor by being free by remaining slaves? If they stay i k !!? ) 1 " 8 th °y ,eave them °pen to white teboftrt Logically there is neither more nor leas or it.

But it ia dreaded that the fteed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land. Will liberation make them any more numeroua 7 Kqually diatribu ted among the states of the whole country, and there would be but one colored to aeven Whites. Could one in any way greatly disturb the seven? There aie many communities now having moie than one free colored person to seven whites and this without any apparent evil from it. The Dis trict of Columbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition. The District has more than one free coloted to six whites, and yet in ita frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored pel sons a3 oue ol its grievances. But why should emancipation South send the freed people North ? Temple ot any color seldom run unless there be something to run from. Here tofore, enslaved people, to some extent, have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution, but if gradual emancipa tion and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from. Their old masters will give them wages at least until new hands can be procured, and the freed men hi turn, will gladly give their labor for wages till new homes can be prooured for them in congenial climates, and with people ol their own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the mutu al interests involved, and, inetny event, cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive them 7 Again, as practice proves more than theory, in any case, has there been any irruption ot colored people Northward because of the abolishment of slavery in the District last spring! What I have said of the proportion ol free colo-ed persons to the whites, in the District, is liom the census of 1860, having no reference to the persons cai'.ed contra band*" or those made Dy the act of Congress abol ishing slavery heie. The plan consisting of these articles is recom mended, not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption; nor will the war nor proceedings under the procla mation of Sepr. 22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely adoption, 1 doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both. And, notwithstanding this plan, the recommenda tion that Congress provides by law for compensa ting any State which mav adopt emancipation be fore this plan shall have been u:ted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both. This plan is recommended as means, not in exclusion of, but additional te ail others for re storing and preserving tbc national authority throughout the Union- l'he subject is preseuted exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan ould, I am confident, secure peace more speedily and maintain it mora permanently tbsn can be done by iorce alone, while the entire cost, considering amounts of payment, would be easier paid than will' be the additional cost of the war, it we rely solely upon force. It is most likely that it would cost no blood at all. The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become such without the concur rence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and after wards, three-fourths of the States. The requisite three-fourths of the States wilt necessarily include seven of the slave states. Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of tLeir severally a dopting emancipation at no very distant day upon tho new constitntionaltcrms. This assurance would end the struggle now, and save the Union forever. 1 do not forget the gravity which should :h3rac terize a paper addressed to the Congress of the na tion by the Chief Magistrate of the nation. Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors; nor that many of you have more experience ttan 1 in the conduct of public affairs, yeti trust that in view of the great responsibility reflKlg upon me, you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display.

KJ-Among tho officers who distinguished thorn selves for their gallantry, at the battle of Poco tuligo, was our young friend, Capt T. 11. I,y ons, of this place. During the action, one o his men (John Coffea) was Wounded, and h was attempting to carry liim off, when a rift ball struck the coat sleeve of the captain ant entered tho body of the wounded man. Tin Captain succeeded, however, in bringing of Coffee, and passed through the conflict unsciv thod. Hio N. Y.

We might have had some hope tlmtthis story would turn out to be correct, had it first appeared in any other print than the Tribune.

Barnum's "What Is It?" is said to be a great curiosity, but we doubt whether it is not ex ceeded in oddity and general ridiculousness by the second annual Message of His Excellency, President Lincoln. Of all the conglomeration of blunders, political, literary and logical, we havo ever attempted to analyse, this Messago is, beyond all doubt, the capstone. It is a stratification of the loose sand of special plead ing and the hot lava of fanaticism, cemented to gether by the soft clay of an uncultivated, and ill-balanced mental organism. I. The President opens by a very mild note of complaint against the action of foreign powers in recognizing the rebel confederacy as belliger ents. This would all be very well, hud not the President himself recognized the rebels as bel ligernnts, by arranging with them a cartel for the exchange of prisoners and doing many othor acts ol' a similar nature. 11. The organization of banking associations under a general act of Congress, is recommend ed. We doubt the constitutionality of this proposition. Congress has power to coin mon ey (that is specie) but not to establish banking associations; and it is quite clear that it is a right reserved to the States to charter hanks and to regulate the issuance of paper curren cy. Mr. Lincoln, either ignorant or regardless of State rights, under the Constitution, propo ses, by an act of Congress, to sweep away state banks and establish upon their ruins United Statc3 banks. If our astute President will take the trouble to consult Chancellor Kent, on this subject, he will find that he (the Presi dent) recommends Congress to go beyond its Con stitutional latitude. 111. The President tells us that the balance in the Treasury 011 the first day of July last, was $13,043,546,81. This is a specious state ment, intended to make credulous people be lieve that there was an actual balance in the Treasury on July 1, 1862. Now, the real state of the case is this: During the last year, according to the Message itself, the Government borrowed $529,692,460,50, to which must be added the former loans amounting to several hundred millions, and °t Ung bQTJ — l/ „ ero the realtors of the^Fe^nge' 'auu 04G.81 to $95,096,922 09, and subtract their sum from about $800,000,000, they will find that instead of an actual balance remaining in the Treasury on the first of July, the Govern ment then owed nearly $700,000,000, for bor rowed money alone, and that there was not a copper in the Treasury wherewith to meet the intcrcst. Put the President's own figures make our financial affairs bad enough. Just think of the expense of carrying on the Government for the last year, amounting to $174,744,778. 16! Nearly a million and a lialf for every day of our lives! Truly we pay enough to be governed better. IV. Indian a (fairs. The President abstains, with great caution, from giving any opinion as to the cause of the Indian outbreaks in Minnes sota, Ho has not one word to say about the infamous conduct of his agents in endeavoring to palm otr "greenbacks" upon the Indians, in stead of paying them in specie, as they are requi red to do, by the terms of the treaties with the aborigines. \ , ct Magna Part. Tho Negro. The proc* • Inanition of the 22d of September, declaring • the freedom of all the negroes in the seceded f States on the first of January next, aud propo i sing to buy the freedom of all other negro slaves > in the Union, is adhered to, and, in addition, a I plan for gradual emancipation, which is to be ! worked out by the year 1900, is submitted. ' Now, if the President has the power, as ho as sumes to have, to abolish slavery by proclama tion and armed invasion, wo do not sec the ne cessity for this proposed gradual emancipation. If. as Mr. Lincoln informed us on the 22d of September, all tho slaves in the states in rebell ion by the first of January, 1803, will be free on that day, by virtue of his proclamation, what use is there in proposing to Congress this tedi ous process of giving them freedom? BesiJes, if tho Abolishment of slavery alone enn restore tho Union, (which no sensible man ever believ ed) are we to lemain till 1900, (37 years) in the torture and agony of partial disunion ? And just here is tho point at which Mr. Lincoln stul tifies himself. Says he, "The proposed eman cipation would shorten the war," &c. Does the President desire to have us understand that tho war can, in any event, continue till 1900? If not, then, how can his proposed emancipa tion schemo, which is not to be fully tested till J 1900, "shorten tho war?" Wc arc also told that I fleeing the slaves would not prove injurious to | white labor, because, forsooth, they "aroalrca- j dy in the land!" But, Mr. Lincoln knows, or I i ougnt to know, that freed negroes are thriftless i creatures, working just enough to reduce tho I 1 wages of labor and becoming dependants upon j the wbetaoco of the white man. As to their i not overrunning the North, let the people along the Pennsylvania border testify. But we cannot pursue this subject much far tier. It is, to us, a disgusting theme. Nay, it ia enough to make any white man's blood b>il, to think that the President of the United Siates would devote ono half of his entire Mes sage to the consideration of a fanatical and worse than fool-hardy project to ameliorate the condition of negroes, when the white people of Union aro crying to him to be delivored from a ten times more dreadful curse than that of negro slavory, the curse of civil war, which the agitation of the negro questi on will inevi tably only aggravate and embitter, lias Abra ham Lincoln no heart, as well as no head ? Or why is it that he can hear the moan of the sol dier's widow, the cry of his orphan child and be unmoved to say even one word for their com fort, whilst, obedient to the dictates of section al animosity and party spite, he forces upon the porplc his own political schemes and partisan chicanery? Citizens and soldiers! ye are white men! Search the message and find a word in it, if you can, calculated for your benefit! You wdl see, as we do, that the whole bent of the Resident's inind is to carry out his Abolition projects—no matter at what expense—no mat te. - if the white race and the black suffer mu tual injury. lie must and will have, if possi ble, the negroes free, though <>, Their swarthy hosts would darken all our plaint, Dju'iling the native horror of the war, And making death mora grim." 

WHAT IT MKANS. —Pcoplo have sometimes wondered why Democratic journals placed a rooster at the head of their papers as an em blem of victory. Parson Brow 11 low fully ex plains the matter as follows: "As the erowing of the cock followed the. betrayal of Christ by Peter, so again the cock crows after the Democrats have attempted to brtray the Government and placo it in the pow er of its enemies." We find the above precious morceau gracing tie columns of a late number of the Blair County Whig. Abolition editors must be "hard :>" for something to say about the recent Dem ieratic victories when they are compelled to jpek up the crude witticisms of a blasphemous ?negade who was kicked out of the Southern oi federacy because he was too mean to bo tbleiatcd even there. But, Parson Brownlow has become a pet with die Abolitionists, notwithstanding the fact that lie aserts that he still holds, as hq did several pears ago, in public debate, that slavery is a di vine institution and must not be interfered with. Tlie inly reason we can see for their great love toward this clerical blackguard, is the fact that hisnaturnl and uncontrollable propensity for lyiig seems to be congenial to their habits and tascs. Why even in the above quoted para graph, preacher as he is, he falsifies Holy Writ. Pefer did not betray the Saviour, as Brownlow sa'S, but denied that he knew hint. In this res- neit Abraham Lincoln is another Peter. Al stand by bis master iVrtt/wtjlidl that lie would last, when the hour of trial camo, he denied and 'snored tii„ k —nter, and it was only then that the cocks crew.

A Eeconnoigsance, The second "Wood Regiment," commanded by Col. lltighurd , whose Head Quarters were recently established at the Poor Mouse, made its sudden uppcarunce in our town the other day, anil for a time, took up its quartersin the wood ynrd of ltev. Mr. Tingling, and at his house quartered a number of turkeys and other ar ticles of subsistence well known to the corps U' arnieo. As they brought their own supplies, however, on their well loaded wagons, it was no one's business what they brought, or didn't leave. On one occasion the Col. suggested tho propriety of backing in one of tho wagons to relieve Quarter Muster Lutz's plate of the skeletons thereon, but tho turkey bones were buried under the wood-pile and that branch of ! the service was dispensed with. Some fear of intervention was at one time entertained from the presence of England on the occasion! (Hil ly I moan).

( EDITOHS MISER'S JOURNAL : Probably ere this reaches you you will have heard of an ad vance made in this department to cut off com munication between Charleston and Savannah at I'ocotaligo bridge, and of the retreat of our forces on account of having no means of con veying ammunition in sufficient quantities to our troops, and of their subsequent return to this place without having accomplished their objuet. The expedition started from this place and Hilton Head oil the afternoon of the 21st. Ou the 22d our forces landed and advanced about live miles when the first fighting commenced.— Twice were tho rebels driven from their posi ions. At the third position our ammunition gave out, and our forces were obliged to retire, which they did in remarkably good order. Our artillery captured one wagon of the rebels' am munition, and fired tho ammunition at them as long as it lasted. The fighting continued from about 12 o'clock until dusk of the evening.— They returned last night, 23d inst. The for ces engaged from Beaufort were portions of tho 55th and 47th Pcnna., CJtli Connecticut, 4th New Hampshire, the Ist Massachusetts Caval ry and Rhode Island battery, under command of Brigadier General Brannan. The entire loss of our forces will amount to about 300 in killed and wounded, though it it may fall as low as 200, but certainly uot more than three hundred.

At one time, when the shells were coming rather too thick for comfort, the order was given to lie down. Dr. Urandt, and the hospital Steward Joseph VV. Hughs, (who, by the way, was for merly a l'ottsvillian,) followed suit. Soon a Kbell came in quite close proximity to where they weru lying, literally covering our two he roos with sand. The Dr. struck two or three somersnujts. The steward says, to use his own language, lie thought "it is all over with you : Brandt." One poor fellow had his whole low* ,cr jaw with a portion of the upper carried a way, leaving only his noso and eyes remaining, exposing his wind pipe to view, and strange to say, he was quite sensible and was still living this morning.
