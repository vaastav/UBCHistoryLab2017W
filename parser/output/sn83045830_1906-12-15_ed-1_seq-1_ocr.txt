LAYMEN SAVING | CHURCH IN FRANCE By Making the Necessary Declar? ation They Can Worship With? out Disobeying the Pope. CLEWS RESISTANCE PASSIVE One Socialistic Paper Says That Ro? manists are Armed, But There is No Evidence That Violent Resistance is Contemplated?Cabinet Preparing to Amend the 1905 Law. (By Associated Press.) PARIS, Dec. iL?There has been issued from the offices of tho Arch? bishop of Paris. Cardinal Richard, an important document which will factli nte a way io settle the church dlffl; culty. This compensation sets forth a declaration that for laymen to wor? ship is nut in disobedience to the In? structions of the Pope, provided their purpose is honesty to avoid disturb? ances, and admit that their purpose is not to infringe upon the helrarchy of ihe church, as tin? Vatican ha.s only forbidden clergymen to carry out the required legal formalities. It is now apparent that the resist? ance of the clergy will be purely pas? sive und that there is no prospect of religious passions being aroused un? less the churches are closed. The government is now resting on its oars and may continue which the cabinet is preparing. in the meantime in the city, except in churches where legal applications were filed, the police again took notes of Infractions of the law at the morn? ing masses. Cardinal Richard Is aWaiting exnulslon from the Episcopal mansion. The government, however, wants to avoid the appearance of force in tiie case of the aged primate who is in bad health and postponing action in the hope that he will depart In a few days of his own volition. No Sign of Armed Resistance. The action, a violent socialist or? gan, today made an attack upon the government, calling attention to the nlleged fact that the Catholic gymnas? tic societies had a number of rifles. There is not the slightest, evidence, however, that armed resistance is contemplated. Drove Out a Policeman. At a church in Vincennes a notice was posted characterizing as "trea? son" the action of two parishoners in making an application and saying that Cardinal Richard was the authority for the statement that the Pope's pro? hibition applied to laymen as well as to the clergy. At Llttlenorth Catholics drove out a policeman, who was rejiorting an infraction of the law at tho church of Le Grand Phillip. Meeting of the Cabinet. Tho cnblnet met today, with Presi? dent Fallieres in the chair, in order to decide upon the now legislation to be presented to parliament. Tho steps to be taken are of a very sweeping character. It is proposed to amend the law of 1005. providing for the separa? tion of church and state by which a year's grace was allowed before*the permanent alienation of the churcti prooerty, and to suppress the privilege of forming new cultural or diocesslon associations, and nil church nroperty, including the seminaries, will he im? mediately handed over to the state.
