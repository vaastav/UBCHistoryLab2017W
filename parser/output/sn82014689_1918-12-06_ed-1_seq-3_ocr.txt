THE MAUI NEWS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1918. tow F.W. Peacock Hears Brother Is Prisoner Was Wounded And Carried Off Field By Huns Had Been With Austra lians V2 Years Other Brother One Of 9 Survivors P. W. Peacock, of f minene has just received word from his family In Eng land announcing the distressing news that one of his two brothers in the British army was wounded and cap tured by the Germans on October 5. This was Lt. John Peacock, who went into the service 3V4 years ago with the Australians and has been in service continuously ever since. He served first in Kgypt and then on the Gallipoli peninsula. He had been home on a furlough and had re joined his battalion but two days when his misfortune occurred. While leading a charge he was seen to fall, and although an effort was made to rescue him the machine gun fire of the Huns prevented. Later he was seen to be picked up by Germans and carried away on a stretcher. He waved his hand as he was going, so hope is felt that his injury is not ser ious and that he may be homo again by this time. Lt. Peacock had been wounded sev eral times and had been decorated for bravery. His brother Arch, is also a lieutenant, but with the Canadian forces. He was a member of the famous "Princess Pat's" and was one of the 9 survivors of his company af ter the terrific engagement early in the war In which the Canadians were all but wiped out. This brother was wounded three times and has been decorated twice. Both young soldiers rose from the ranks and have probably had as steady and long continued fighting as any men who took part in the war. Mr. Peacock's last information was written on October 24. He hopes daily to receive further information. Bad Vegetable Pest Discovered On Maui The California morning-glory, a bind-weed which has probably come to the Islands in shipments of hay or grass seeds, threatens to become a serious pest on Maui, according to advices received recently by James Lindsay, of Haiku territorial forester for Maui, from C. S. Judd, chief forest er in Honolulu. The menace was first discovered near Paia by Manager H. A. Baldwin, of the Maui Agricultural Co., who took prompt steps to eradicate it and lt may be that he has succeeded as Mr. Lindsay has been unable to locate any specimens. The plant, which was a well-known pest in England more than a century ago, is a twining vine which seems to thrive by being cut down, and it also grows from roots left in the ground. It chokes other plants on which it climbs for support. The only sure way to destroy it is to dig it up and burn it.

WILSON TELLS PLANS AND HOPES OF FUTURE WASHINGTON, December 2 The President read his message before the joint session of congress today. It was an eloquent tribute for the fighters who won the war, and also for the industrial leaders who gave the nation splendid services and for the laborers whose work at home made victory possible. The President expects a final peace treaty will be signed next spring. He urged the adoption of Secretary Lane's plans to provide work at home for returning soldiers through great reclamation projects; also the development of public works projects. He admits that the future of the railroads is a great problem, and he has no solution to offer. He asks congress to help in framing legis lation on the matter. He urges a square deal for business when taxes are imposed, that as ear'y as possible business concerns be informed what share of the taxation burden they must bear so that they can figure on reconstruc tion problems. The government's expenses will continue heavy during demobilization. He recommended heavy taxation of war profits, and urged America to help northern France and Belgium through priority shipments and otherwise in the restoration of their shattered industrial structure which makes them face immediate keen competition in the world's markets, and arc thus heavily handicapped. The President stated that he feels he must go to the peace con ference because all belligernts have accepted the American principles and the ideals which he annunciated, and they reasonably desire his presence to assist in their interpretation and application. He feels that to carry out ideals for which Americans fought and died is his first duty, and he appreciates the heavy responsibility and earnestly asks and hopes for the united support of congress in the delicate task. "I am the servant of the nation," he said. He promised to keep this country and congress fully in touch with progress so as full co-operation may be possible, through cable and wire less communication. Absolutely no censorship will be placed on peace discussion. Mr. Wilson praised women's splendid war work and said congress should reward them by granting them equal political right of suffrage. He expects an immediate revival of a great industrial development. He has no definite program for internal reconstruction, but counts on the native intelligence of the people and industrial leaders bringing about readjustment satisfactorily much faster than legislation could do. He takes it for granted that congress will continue its naval pro gram undertaken before we entered the war.
