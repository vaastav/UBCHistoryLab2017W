Rosecrans is the reputed author of a scheme for the organization of the Democratic party for the next Presidential campaign. He proposes to divide the Democratic voters into sections of tens, fifties, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands and twenty thousands, each section to have a chief, whose duty it shall be to see that the voters under him shall be in line for party service at the polls or elsewhere, in obedience to orders received by him from the head centre. The chiefs are also to be entrusted with the duty of collecting campaign funds and of distributing campaign documents, as well as the management of cam. paigri work within their jurisdiction. The National committee, under this system, would issue its order to State committees, and they would in turn instruct chiefs of twenty thousands, &c., down to chiefs of tens. It is understood that Gen. Rosecrans proposes to raise campaign funds by voluntary contributions of five cents each from every enrolled Democrat in the organization. ? At Shreveport, La., last Friday, Richmond Stuart, colored, was hanged for the murder of his wife, in the presence of fully 4,000 people, most colored. Many colored people came from places hundreds of miles distant. Stuart mounted the scaffold firmly, leading in prayer and giving out the hymn himself, asking those present to join. He proclaimed his innocence. The trap was sprung at 11.25 P. M., and Stuart was pronounced dead after hanging ten minutes. The fall was about eight feet. His neck was broken and only one or two nerve twitches were observed after the drop fell. Just before the hanging Stuart called his cousin to the gallows and, bidding him good-bye, directed that his body be buried on the plant at ion, where he was born.

YORKVII.LE, S. C. : THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 0, 1883. THE POLITICAL TRIALS. The political trials were opened in the United States District Court in Columbia last Friday. The first case on tlie docket is that of John Mitchell, colored Democrat, of Charleston, charged with resisting and obstructing Deputy Marshals. In the preliminary proceeding, Mr. J. P. K. Bryan, for the defense, argued against the right of the prosecution to "stand aside" jurors, urging that the United States Court ought to conform its practice to that of the State in which it is held, and that by the Act of the Legislature of this State, passed in 1882, the right of the prosecution to "stand aside," was revoked. Col. L. F. Youmans submitted a communication from the State Supreme Court, declaring that they could find no instance in the judicial records of this State wherein the State had exercised the privilege of standing aside. After consultation, Judge Bond declined to make any new rule for the term, Judge Bryan dissenting from Judge Bond's ruling, and an exception being taken by the defense. An attempt to set aside thejurors on the ground of omission to make oath in the marshal's return, and a demurrer to the indictment, were both overruled by Judge Bond, Judge Bryan dissenting and the defense excepting in each instance. Judge Bryan said that sitting as a Judge and a citizen of South Carolina, he felt bound by the decision in the Ellenton cases, when Chief Justice Chase was sitting in the Court, to dissent, in order to protect the right of every citizen who comes here to be tried, until the question of standing aside shall be definitely settled by the highest tribunal. The drawing ot the jury was then completed. Judge Melton stood aside eight white men and one negro, all supposed to be Democrats. The counsel for the defense challenged three peremptorily, and two for cause, and made an issue in the case of one white man. In the last three cases the jurors were declared qualified by Judge Bond and were sworn in. The result was a jury of eleven whites and one colored, most if not all of whom, by the standing aside tactics of the District Attorney, are believed to be of the opposite political party to tliat of the accused. The names of the jurors are as follows: E. L. Arthur, Joseph Bush (colored), Fuller Prickett, J. H. Johnson, Cul len Lark, E. R. Bolger, J. G. Long, 1). C. Wolfe, Hezekiah Ellis, John Agnew, Jeremiah Looper and Middleton Ray. After the jury were sworn, Judge Bryan cautioned them to avoid all conversation respecting the case, and Judge Bond added that if anyone attempted to speak to them about the case it should be reported to the court. The court was then adjourned to Monday at 10 A. M. Monday was occupied in taking testimony in the case of Mitchell, and on the adjournment of Court, at 4 P. M., 10 A. M., on Tuesday was set for the 'argument to commence. O'DONNELL CONVICTED. The trial, in London, of Patrick O'Donnell, for the murder of James Carey was concluded last Saturday, the second day of the hearing. The testimony offered by the prosecution was substantially the same as the statements hitherto published in regard to the affair. On Saturday the courtroom was crowded, but there were few persons outside of the building. Pryor sat behind Charles Russell, the senior counsel for O'Donnell. The prisoner's brother was present in court. O'Donnell appeared calm. Walter Young, the Port Elizabeth cab driver, was called for the defense, lie testified that he frequently drove Carey's family around Port Elizabeth and they ought to know him. When MrS. Carey and her son Tom denied it, he was panic-stricken. He once said to Tom Carey at Port Elizabeth, "You. are a line fellow. Why did not you shoot O'Donnell when he shot your father!" Tom answered, "I had no revolver. I went to get it, but when I went there it was gone, because my father had it." Witness had mentioned this to other cab drivers. The crossexamination of this witness elicited 110 material change in his testimony. No other witness was called for the defense and Russell began his address to the jury, ltussell spoke four hours, and upon concluding his address he was greeted with loud applause, which Judge Denman sternly repressed. The Attorney General occupied an hour and a half in Ids address, closing the case for the government. Judge Denham then delivered his charge to the jury, which, at 7 P. M., retired. At 7.40 o'clock they returned to the court room and requested Judge Denman to explain to them certain matters connected with the case. At 8.40 P. M. they again returned to the court room and asked further explanations. These were given them and they again retired. At!) o'clock the jury came into court with a verdict of "guilty." Judge Denman thereupon sentenced O'Donnell to be hanged on Monday, December 17. V flin cnti +n?ir>r? -ivou nnaspfl O'l^nniipll HIV OVUlVll\.V T T v * ) V ? wanted to speak. The Judge, however, ordered his removal. The police seized him, when O'Donnell held up his right hand, his fingers extended, and shouted, "Three cheers for old Ireland!" "Good-bye United States!" "To hell with the British, and the British Crown!" "It is a plot made up by the Crown!" The prisoner, shouting, cursing and struggiing, was then forcibly removed by the police, amid the most fearful confusion and slamming of doors. This action of O'Donnell caused the greatest excitement and surprise, as he had previously gained the sympathy of the audience by his demeanor. Mr. Pryor did not appear formally in the case. He states that he had resolved to apply for a hearing in the case of O'Donnell and to force an explicit refusal to his application, but that the other counsel in the case gave, in writing, their opinion that the appearance of an American lawyer sent by Irish-Americans would be fatal to the prisoner. They further stated that if the application was made thpy would surrender their briefs. Pryor finally consulted O'Donnell, who decided to abide by the opinion of Uussell and Sullivan, THE 

TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT. The election at Black's Station, in this j county, on Saturday last, on the question of "License" or "No License," resulted in fa- , vor of "License," though our correspondent ] failed to give us the vote cast on either side.. Black's is now the only incorporated town in the county that legalizes the sale of in toxicating liquors. The - ction in Greenville, on Saturday,' on the question of "License" or "No License," passed off quietly, notwithstanding the intense interest manifested and the unu sually heavy vote polled. A dispatch to the News and Courier says when the pollsopened, the liquor men rushed in a crowd of about two hundred negroes, who voted solidly for "License." The phalanx was, however, finally broken, and the voting was quiet, with alternate squads of wet and dry men, during the day. The ladies of the Woman's ? -* rP/imrvAi??n/?A licwl on oKnn..

In other portions of the city the liquor men had an abundance of something to eat and drink, which was lavishly dealt out to whites and blacks the night preceding, and on the day of election. About noon, touching de monstrations were made by processions first of white and then of colored children. Temperance banners were hanging in profusion about the streets, and either side had a band of music on hand, and numbers of men were at work. There was a continued, steady, quiet, earnest and determined effort for either side. The vote resulted as follows: For license, 6G4; for no license, ">84, giving a majority of 80 for the former. In regard to the indiscriminate sale of liquor in Greenville, the Xeivs says the liquor dealers of that city held a meeting a few nights ago and by comparing notes prepared a list of 48 names of citizens of the city and county who are recognized as victims of strong drink and unable to control, their appetite for it. Every bar keeper has refused to sell liquor to these men, and if they obtain it hereafter they will have to send somebody else for it. It may not be known by many that a written notice from any relative of an habitual drinker to liquor dealers not to sell him liquor, makes them liable for any damage that may result to the drinker or anybody else from liquor sold ? --- * _ - -- ^..1 ^ 1* 11. ^ ?1! 4 nun oy ine recipient 01 me ounce. aiiv married woman can effectually prevent her husband from drinking at the bars by sending notice to the saloon keepers not to sell him. In Marion, on Saturday, a holy-contested campaign was closed, with the election on the question of "License" or "No License." The total vote polled was 273, of which 14!) were for no-license and 124 for license, amajority of 25 for no-license. The registered vote was 153 white and 130 colored, seventeen more than the votes polled. Only 34 white voters voted the license ticket, while 37 colored votes voted the no-license ticket, among which were the most respectable of their color. In Winnsboro, last Friday, the election to decide the question of license or no li cense for the sale of liquor in that town resulted as follows: Against License, 171; for License 112. It is said that there will be a contest on the part of those in favor of license, hut the general belief is that there have been no irregularities sufficiently serious to vitiate the election. Prohibition scored a victory in Spartanburg on Friday. Both sides put forth their utmost efforts and a heavy vote was polled; but "No license" won by 82 out of G9o votes. The town of Orangeburg voted last Friday on the question of License or No License, giving a majority of 188 in favor of "No License." The election at Blackstock on Monday, to decide whether licenses should longer be issued for the sale of intoxicating beverages in that place, resulted in a majority beingcast in favor of No License. MEETING OF CONGRESS. The Forty-eighth Congress of the United States assembled in Washington on Monday last. At 12 o'clock M., the Senate was called to order by President pro (em. Senator Edmunds, of Vermont, and prayer was otrerered by the chaplain, Rev. J. J. Bullock. The credentials of a number of new members were laid before the Senate, and the members were duly qualified. The customary resolutions notifying the IIouso of Renrpsentntives and the President that the Senate was ready for business, were agreed to and a resolution adopted that 12 .o'clock he the hour of meeting till further notice. On motion of Senator Garland, of Arkansas, the Senate then, at 12,30, took a recess of one hour. On the re-assembling of the Senate at 1.30, Senator Ingalls, of Kansas, moved that in order to afford an opportunity for receiving notification of the organization of the House of Representatives, and if possible to receive the President's message immediately, the recess be extended to 3 P. M., which was agreed to. At 3 o'clock the Senate was again called to or der, and there being no prospect of the House organization being completed in time to do business this afternoon, on motion of Senator Ingalls, the Senate adjourn ed until Tuesday. At precisely 12 o'clock, Clerk McPherson rapped the House to order and proceeded to call the roll, which disclosed the presence of 31G members. The nominations for Speaker being then in order, Geddes of Ohio said: "I nominate for Speaker of the House for the Fortyeighth Congress, Hon. John G. Carlisle, o:f Kentucky, a man of pre-eminent qualification for the place. Cannon, of Illinois, presented the name of Hon. J. W. Keifer, of Ohio; and Lyman, of Massachusetts, presented the name of Hon. G. 1). Robinson, of Massachusetts. Morrison, of 111., Tucker, of Va., Iteed, of Maine, and Calkins, of Indiana, were appointed as tellers and the clerk proceeded to call the roll. The result was announced as follows: Carlisle, 191; Keifer, 112; Robinson, 2. (James, of New York, and Lyman, of Massachusetts); J. S. Wise, of Virginia, 1, (York, of North Carolina); J. W. Wadsworth, New York, 1, (Ochiltree, of Texas) Edward S. Lacy, Michigan, 1, (White, of Kentucky). The clerk thereupon declared Carlisle elected, and Randall, of Pennsylvania, and Keifer, of Ohio, escorted that gentleman to the chair. His entrance into the chamber was a signal for loud applause, and the oath of office was administered. Upon taking the chair, Mr. Carlisle addressed the House briefly, concluding as follows : "Many reforms are undoubtedly necessary, and, it will be your duty, after careful examination of the whole subject in all its bearings, to decide how far they should extend, and when and in what manner they should be made. If there be any fear that your action on this or any other subject will actually be injurious to any interest, or even afford reasonable cause for alarm, I am quite sure that they will be agreeably disappointed. What the country has a right to expect is strict economy in the administration of every department of the government, Just and equal taxation for public purposes, faithful observance of the limitations of the constitution, and scrupulous regard for the rights and interests of the great body of the people in order that they may be protected, as far as Congress has power to protect them, against encroachments from ever direction, Whatever can lje dope, under the circumstances surround ing us, to meet this expectation, ought to he done in my judgment." After Speaker Carlisle had concluded his u address, the States were called alphabetical ly, and the Representatives, as their names ; * were called, came forward and were quali- c tied. After the transaction of other routine j. business, the House adjourned until 12 INT. ; t Tuesday. ! r

On Wednesday of last week, a serious wreck occurred on the ., C. & A. Railroad, thirty miles this side of Columbia. The pay train was coming this way under a full head of steam, when it was suddenly stopped by coming in contact with the rear end of a freight train that was standing on the t main line. The pay-Arain was going at 1 full speed and it crashed into the freight i. train with terrible force. The engine of the j pay train split one of the freight cars com- > pletely in two and ran on the side track ^ carrying another car with it, something after the style of a turtle and its shell. The a impending catastrophe was seen in time to ( avoid a loss of life. All the hands on the y freight train hopped to the ground, and engineer, fireman, conductor and all aboard () the pay train, jumped oft'before the crash J, came and escaped with their lives. The j officers of the road had a court of inquiry * and found that the accident was due to neg- c ligence on the part of the freight train in not flagging the pay train that was known to * be coming behind. The conductor and all the crew of the freight train, with the ex- * ception of the engineer and fireman, were j discharged. (, LComiiiiiiiicatuil J Rev. W. U. i'KESSLEY.
