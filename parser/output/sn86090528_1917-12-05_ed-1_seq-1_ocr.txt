Finally after an lioir or so of ar- gument and discussion the resolution that if some assurance was given them that Colonel Harvey would not change his mind again as to the lo- cation o the trail through Caddo county they would see that the road .was built along the route specified j the resolution.

OrNLY IV QEAOTMt ADS 1 MA Looked Pretty Dark For 'Nyky' But It V as All O.K.,atThat Nykyfor Howrykasz Is not such a bad "umbra" at that. Ho knows the interior of the Grady county jail even like Christy Mathewson knows the Interior of the Polo grounds, for ho has been there, quite some time. Time was when Nykyfor was look ed upon with solemn disapproval and suspicion by the Grady county offi cers, for the reason that ho chucked a letter from an automobile driven by Bob Castleman, and in which con veyance Nyky was being transport ed from Amber to Chickasha to take up his abode iu thu Grady county bus tile, pending an Investigation of his attitude annul iiulioiis iu general and tho United States in particular. This letter wus some epistle. It smicked of all tho intrigue that a short story writer could have crowd ed into a dozen magazine pages and to mako the bet even stronger against Nyky there was a map of the Missis sippi valley with the Big River heavi ly accented with blue crayon and with the city of Memphis indicated by a heavy blot that drew the atten tion thereto, even as a tavern sign draws tho gaze tf a -wayfarer pack ing a thirst ridden throat. One look at. the Hitter and then a look at the map with, the heavy biot indicating Memphis, and one would swear that the whole bloomin' town was due for a good blowing up at the hands of the kaiser's agents. Especially was this apparent truth brought home when it was seen that the state of Tennessee was heavily outlined with Crayon. One just knew that some thing tragic was going to happen to BURTON IS MEMBER OF SCH.B0ARI The board of education in regular session yesterday elected Ed C.

MIR Tennessee and it seemed o patriotic duty to warn that grand old slate. To make things look worse, there were numerous little dots hero and there down the Mississippi river that a very slight stretch of the Imagina tion might weave Into a Btrlntf of bridges that were slated to bo sent skywurd by the simple application beneath them of a few Well placed sticks of dynamite. So, us has been indicated, It looked pretty dark for Nyky. It was u lot more trying on Hodge Bailey. He not only had his suspi cions, but he could neither prove nor disprove them. This, for the simple reason that ho could not read the letter, nor could ho find any among the tribe of foreigners who got their mall here, who could master tho lin go. Therefore the sheriff Bent the letter to a brother officer at Fort Worth. The mystery was cleared up when Sheriff B:i" -ived the l'ol lowing from Fort Worth: "It was written in one of tho sev enty or more Russian dialects. It took a Hearch of about three hours to find out what particular Russian dialect It was, and to find someone to translate it. The dialect was that of Mai or Llttlo Russia. "Instead of turning out to be a plot the lettr vas. only a recounting ot tho hardships of the Russian to a friend, thank. ng tho friend for hav ing sent Iilin Borne money and speak ing of a patent from which the two and some third person were to real Izo much money when it was per fected."
