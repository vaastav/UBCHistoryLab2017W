The address was of considerable length, the first portion being devoted toa review of i lie Mormon church., Mr Dubois as sorted the control of the church to be complete in toe hierarchy, consisting of the presidency and tli U ap siles. of which Mr. Snoot was one. This control he maintained, was ccelesia. tlcal, poliiical and commercial, and was eXerclaed completely over follow era who com. principally from foreign countries. The constant tendency lie said, was to make the church and state one, with the control in the church. Polygamous relations were being sustained, Mr Dubois said, by Presi dent Joseph Smith and a majority of the 12 apostles. Continually there was contracting of new polygamous mar riages surreptitously arranged by the church in Canada, Mexico, or mi high seas. Polygamists, he said eupy the highest positions, politii and In the e&urch, and constitute wealthiest and most powerful mem hers of the church organization. This is a change, he arseried, from the old days when polygamy wag entered into indiscriminately. Now the polygani ists are selected by officers of ihe church and In this way Is being built up a cult and aristocracy of plygain fats, But no record of tiolygamous marriages Is kept which is available for the American people. Because of thin, he pointed out. the futility of passing a national law prohibiting the practice. f Church Holds Full Sway.

The senator was a pillar in the church, and in con trol of its temporal, spiritual and polit ical policies, and was selected foi the senate because of this position in the church. "Smoot.
