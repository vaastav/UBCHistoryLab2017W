THE SINCLAIR COLONY F enures of Its Condition When It Actually Started. FINELY HOUSED IN HELICON HALL About a Dozen Small Familie« Will Lire For Kirnt Winter Scanon In Separate Apartment» Inder Same Roof Wear Kiifflcwuod, X. J.—Special Provlnlon Made For Children—Sepa rate Dinini? and Common Sleeplns Room—Social Equal* as Worker*. With the 1st of November the serv antless, co-operative home colony ex periment initiated by Upton Sinclair took definite shape, a dozen or fifteen small families having taken quarters for the winter In the large and unique mansion on the western brow of the Palisades, near Eiigiewood, N. J., known as Helicon Hall. The original j^lan (fontemplates a group of kitclieuless and servautless cottages about a central dining and so cial hall or inn. For the first winter season, however, those who have join ed In the experiment are willing to compromise to the extent of living In »eparate apartments under the samo roof. The house, which was formerly a high class private school for boys and which stands ou a ten acre plot, with woods stretching away for miles on two sides and a maguilicent outlook westward over the valley of the Ilack ensack, has been purchased by a stock company iu which Mr. Sinclair has a controlling interest and of which ho Is president. This company has leased the proper ty to a membership co-operation com prising those who are or may be inter ested in the experiment. Thus In the management of the affairs of the col ony all members have a voice, whether they have capital invested iu the col ony or not. The experiment is purely one in household or domestic economy—1. e., to create a comfortable and satisfying country home within the reach of those earning moderate professional in comes in which tlie care of children from infancy may be delegated to ca pable and expert persons, with such co-operation as parents may be dis posed to give, and the performance of the necessary work of the household by persons who can be and who expect to be treated as social equals. While membership in the colony does not Im ply any obligation to take part in the household routine, the directors give preference to members who offer their services, provided tliey are satisfac tory. The colony at this stage numbers about forty adults, including workers, and fifteen children. The house is well adapted to co operative homemaking, with Its ample parlors, dining room and assembly rooms, its billiard parlor, bowling al ley, swimming tank and large oblong courtyard, filled with rare tropical trees, shrubs, fish pools aud winding pathways. The immense four sided fireplace at the point where the court yard is curtained from the front spa clous hallway forms a natural common meeting place for this multiple family. Professor William Noyes of the Teachers' college has been chosen pres ident of the colony, and his wife, Mrs. Anna Noyes, has been employed as the manager. Mrs. Cora L. I'otter, wife of one of the other directors, has been engaged to take charge of the chil droit's department. She will be assist ed by several of the mothers. A profes sional kindergartner will train the chil dren during part of the day. A sepa rate dining room is provided for the children, fitted with low chairs and ta bles and cupboards for the table serv ice, the children being invited to help lu the serving of their own meals. There is also a common sleeping room for the children, but parents do not place their children there unless they prefer it. Carrying out the idea of social equals as workers, Mrs. Lilian Davis, a Cor nell graduate and domestic science ex pert, takes charge of the kitchen, with several efficient helpers; two Yale stu dents are looking after the stable and janitor work, while a Providence man ufacturer serves as assistant manager, and an ex-Tennessee lawyer and stu dent of human brotherhood helps Mrs, Davis chopping hash and cleaning ket ties. Mrs. Bertha Wilklns, well known In the west as a socialist writer and re former, undertakes to organize the laundry work. For the sake of har mony both vegetarian and meat meals are served at separate tables, and the expense of the entire living Is divided pro rata, allowing for a moderate in come on the capital Invested.

Chicago , Dec. 10.—The fight of the Standard Oil company against the ten indictments against the Standard Oil company of Indiana which were re turned August 29, was commenced to day in the United States district court before Judge Landis. The Standard Oil company has entered a demurrer. The attorneys for the Standard Oil company contended in support of their demurrer that section 10 of the rate law passed by congress June 29, re peals the Elkins law under which the government is bringing the action against the company, and that the in dictments are not sufficiently specific because they do not comprehend all of the elements in the case. The contention that the Elkins law is repealed by the rate law and that the offenses alleged cannot therefore be punished under the former act, was contradicted by United States District Attorney Sims, who declared that sec tion 13 of the revised statutes covers the case, in that it states that the re peal of the old statute does not con done prior offenses, unless the repeal ing act so specifies in particular. The trial of the packing house com panies indicted for conspiracy in re straining trade, was today continued until January 10. The reason for the postponement is that the attorneys for both the government and the packing houses are engaged in other trials in the United States district court. Object To llaclielor Tax. B cuusaw, N. C., Dec. 10.—Forty four old bachelors of this place are up iu arms against the first buchelor tax ever levied in the "Tar Heel" state. They lay the blame on President Roosevelt. Young spinsters of the county are, on the contrary, elated and openly praise the president for his "race sui cide" stand, which they regard as re sponsible in part for the action of the county commissioners in laying an imposition on those who will not be come benedicts. The Rev. C. H. Utley, one of the most popular preachers in this part of the state, was the first of the "44" club to become apprised of the new law affecting them. He went to the court house to list his taxes, and was informed that he would have to pay the bachelor tax, amounting to a double poll tax. From the expression on his face it could be seen that he did not intend to pay it again. it is the opinion of a majority of the 44 bachelors that the tax is uncon stitutional, as is evidenced by the provision of the broad clause that men are entitled to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." "We untrammeled men ought to hang together," says "Bill" Bur gaw, an old-time resident who has steadfastly refused to become en meshed by feminine wiles. "We'll write to the president that he's stirred up Pender county in an unreasonable way. We'll placo the blame where it belongs." Sugar Heulers l'a y Fines. New York , Dec. 10.—C. Goodloe, Edgar and Edward Earl, members of the firm of William F.

Chairman R. L. Williams of the committee on railroads and public service corporations sprung a sur prise when he introduced a resolution providing for 2-cent fares. Mr. Wil liams stated that if the plank was not embodied in the constitution, it would be submitted separately to the people. Nobel Prize For Roosevelt Christiana , Norway, Dec. 10.— The Norwegian parliament has con ferred the Nobel peace prize upon President Roosevelt. The Nobel prize is awarded to President Roosevelt in recognition of his services in ending the Russo-Japanese war. Candidates for this distinction must be proposed by the legislative bodies, peace or ganizations or universities. The Nobel peace prize is part of a bequest left by Dr. Alfred Bernhard Nobel, the Swedish scientist, who died in 189(5. By this will a large portion of his fortune was devoted to five an nual prizes, each valued at about $40, 000. They were awarded for the most important discoveries in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine; for the most distinguished work of an idealistic tendency in the field of liter ature and for the best effort toward the fraternity of nations and the pro motion of peace. The last named is awarded by the Norwegian parlia ment. The others are awarded by in stitutions at Stockholm. The Sonnet Writers. The fashion of sonnet writing was at its height in the sixteenth century, when Ronsard, the French "prince of poets" in his own country aud genera tion, wrote over 900 sonnets, a total which appears only to have been ex ceeded by Gomez de Quevedo, the Spanish Voltaire, who Is said to have written over 1,000. Fortunately for sonnet lovers some of the best poets have beeu prolific sonneteers. Petrarch, who created the classic model which later poets imitated, wrote 313. Cam oens Is responsible for 352, Sir Philip Sidney wrote 108, Spenser 88 aud Dante 80. English sonnets were first written by Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503-42) and Henry Howard, earl of Surrey (1517-47), and the first appearance of any in book form was in a rare publi cation briefly known as "Tottle's Mis cellany," the full title belüg "Songs and Sonnettes written by the Right Hou oure Lorde Henry Howard, late Earle of Surrey, and other." The greatest sonneteers of our language are Shake speare, Milton, Wordsworth and Ros settl.—London Staudard. Water right blanks—only correct form published—for sale at the River Prkss office.
