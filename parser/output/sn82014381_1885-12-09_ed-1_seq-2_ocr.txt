QUILT CRAZE. There is DO telling wliM I persistent and determined woman cannot accomplish, rhe case of .»Irs. Kinnri P. Wright testifies i i a degree of perseverance and boldness for the accomplishment of a very u-cle.^ end, th.it i~ not often paralleled. Mrs. .• determined to make an autograph <iui!t. Many another woman has decided to do the same thing, and has done it, to BBoyaace of many human beings. But K;:im:i aimed i 1 I irge game, and she brought it down. We have no iaeau.s of ing bow many times dhc was snubbed, nor with what defeats sho met. She is silent on these i^iiits. From the measure of her success, however, we may safely a#- MinK th.it she wan rebufled limes without Dumber But her triumph was not dimmed. She blade Bfl :iul>%r.<!.b <jui!t '.lib a* no other woman dreamed of, and ithassxr quired such fame that hundreds of Dews have given columns to description of it, and the labors of the maker in secur ing t!i" signatures of illustrious people. The quilt *a« recently again on exhibition in N. •.. York, it that strangest of all fiir- held :ui exposition of "crazy v..i1;." And a fair it was, If wi are to believe our New York ex . nances. The crazy quilt of Mrs. Wright i« writt.n over with distinguished names rst bands, such as the three G4ad- Pn side t Irthnr and Cleveland, Generals Grant and Logan, Beecher, Tal msgc. Bourgeon, Farrar, John Bright, ! swell, Booth, Barrett, Balvini, I'atti, • iei-Kter, Kellogg, Carey, and some hun dreds i : other distinguished people in war, politics, science, religion, music, the drama, etc. Victoria and Wales, more discreet than others, wrote through the agency of tlieir :• ■:. . The strange fancy of :;ph .|uilt> is born of the present decade, and has had ;: furious run, but iii no instance has there been any Buch bbc — attained as that by Mrs. Wright. In • icfl of this fact, and the attention her achievement has had from the press, it must naln famous people shiver to con tempUtewhat i~ probably before them. For it is perfectly certain that hundreds of women will set about to eclipse the fame of Mr- Wright, and besiege dignitaries and public people, until they will regret with inexpressible bitterness tho amiable weak n.>s« that lit I some hundreds of them to yield t.. the request of Mrs. Wright, and thus set a precedent against which the <lor>r can now scarcely be dosed. The evolutions of patchwork, from the plain calico tl raps stitched by our grcit gnmdmothera in the gossipy days af the <>id-time quilting circles through the changing fash tons of bed coverings up to that mon-.tHK.ity of silk kad riot of color, the cra/y .|iiili, has •■•iliiiin.it'^l, let us hope, in this last covering, sanctified by the touch of distingui^ied hands, the anto gr.ipli '(tiilt. Let ns also indulge the hope that no feminine genius will attempt to work out still other ]>osMhilitie» in the quilt lino, as. for instance, in the effort to produce a photO-pO) trait o,uilt —that would, indeed, prove to bo the last straw.

They Ciin take it and pot it in ■the papers." Thereupon he threw it at the rejiorters' desk, and was true enough ' in his aim to plump one of that class of useful and industrious citizens under the ear. Thin set the audience, we are told, i wild with delight, and the people present fairly howled themselves hoarse. The person explain.-! that all this performance or. his part was a bit of pleasantry. Pub- j ny. very funny. Hut back of it is bis anx iety to distract public attention from tin real beta about him and his connection vith the Taber case. Such a man, who can play clown one moment and call down the benediction of God on the spectators the next, is a disgrace to the cloth. He li:is properly been locked out of the house of the Lord, and should be kept out. ly another place this morning we pre sent the annual rej>ort submitted to the Sacramento Board of Trade by its Presi dent, Joseph Stiffens. It will he found to be a document of much interest, treating Of subjects of vital importance to the peo ple of this city and State. The references mad.' to the immigration work in north ern California, to the completion of the California and Oregon Railroad and the Speedy improvemeol of the Sacramento river by the Government, are worthy of especial examination. The recommenda tions are to the point, unmistakable and wise. Tin: President's message bat hand. It is a Lengthy document, and comment upon it is reserved until it shall have had ma ture consideration. So far as oar reading has progressed it impresses US with the idea that it is .1 thoughtful, conservative document. Tbm result of the election in this city on Monday illustrates again what adepts our friends, the Democrats, are in trading the tail of their ticket for the head, and how stupidly to Republicans trade the bead of their ticket for the tail. Chinese Question in Sacramento. The condition of the public mind in this city upon the Chinese question has already been fully considered in these columns. The Board of Trade at its meeting yester day, in discussing the views presented in the annual report of its President, wisely concluded that whatever action could or should be taken upon the subject, with a view to restrictins the evils arising from Mongolian competition and invasion shoald be participated in by those most dcepiy concerned in the business and social we!faro of the community. Accordingly a committee from the Board of Trade was appointed, which is to hold a conference with a committee from the Citizens' Ass ociation this forenoon, with a view to making arrangements to participate in the public meeting at Turner Hall to-morrow evening. This is a matter, certainly, i;i which busi ness men and laborers are equally inter ested, and in which tin-conservative ele ment should take a. duly prominent posi tion. The present appearance is that the committees from the Hoard of Trade and the Citizens'* Association will enlistagen eral participation in the meeting, not only on the part of business men, bm those from all the various industries and trades represented in the city, and thus bring into ■ mnsei upon this important subject all i lasses Interested in such practicable meas ures as may be adopted for complete re striction of Chinese immigration and the removal of ruinous competition with ser vile lab..:.

The papers of California are full of praise of Senator Stanford for bia gift of nve millions of property for the foundation and support of a great university frea to all it is certainly a princely gift, and we may well be thankful to the generous giver. Other men in the United States possess great wealth, but we have still to hear of one who has proved so generous in its dis position as Stanford has.—TUkiah City Press. Senator Stanford and his wife will prob ably spend the most of their great fortune in carrying out their University plans. It is fortunate for California that wealth has been bestowed upon such a couple, whose acts of charity are ot daily occurrence. It is well known that Mrs. Stanford has do nated thousands upon thousands of dollars for charitable purposes in this State, par ticularly in San Francisco, and the Senator has recently given $">,oooto the Grant mon umental fund, and $5,000 to a Zion church in North Carolina. One of the most magnificent and sub stantial tributes to the educational necessi ties of the age the world ever witnessed has been consummated in our beautiful young State of California, barely two score years old. Leland Stanford comes to the front ;i» the foremost man in behalf of education in its highest elements. So much nobility oi mind is apparent in this great deed of love to his fellow man, that we stand in deep respect before the will that with a single expression detennioesit.—[Dramatic News, •Sacramento. Creed Haymond and s. Osbom arrived here on the 3:30 train last evening from San Francisco, the former bringing with him the trust deed, recently made by Sena tor Stanford, for founding and endowing the Leland Stanford Junior University. The deed N being recorded at the office of the County Clerk. The real estate named in the deed lies in three counties—Santa Clara Butte and Tehama—and the deed baa to be recorded in everyone of the three. The deed is one of the most mag nificent and skillful pieces of pen work that ha- probably ever been seen. It is encased in a small rosewood, satin-lined t>;.\. and coven liis sheets ..f parchment. On the lirst pageis a large monogram oftbe title of the University, worked in colors. The title page contains the words, " Grant Founding and Endowing the Leland Stan ford Junior University." The deed .■•.in menees with "We, Leland Stan lord and Jane Lathrop Stanford, husband and wife," etc. The whole deed is written in large letters of German text, of various shades, and at the beginning of each paragraph is a large ornamental letter, elaborately shaded and gilded. The deed is dated November 11. 1885, and covers thirty-one pages. Follow ing then conies a description of thi' land under the title of "Schedule A." in plain chuography. This description covers ii fly-seven pages, and at the bottom is bigned by the twenty-four trustees, the names of Matliew I. Deady, of Oregon and Justice Stephen J.

We regret that the plau of securing the co-operation of neighboring counties has not been entirely niccessiul. But there stands out againn this Met another one very encouraging : that is. that the Sacramento county organization ami this city, by their financial Bid, have made the work a grand success, although the other counties before referred to have so far received almost the entire benefit. This work is charity to our neighbors au<l 'bread cast upon the waters" for us. Dr. Latham's railed experience, great mental resources, plain, fair and pleading style of dic tion, make him the rig'ut man in tne right place. The iKx'tor gave me quite a lengthy report of the doings of the Association during the past year, from which the following facts are culled : There has been collected by the Immigration Association from various, sources. &!,101 2D : of thi», $-tj.> was received from other counties, leaving f-J.tvrr.

Beren] thousand copies of descriptions of the same section have been translated into the <ier rnan language. Hid circulated at the East and in Europe.

These are vow i>er manent settlers of northern California, and for us are producers and consumers. THE 

BUSINESS OF THE VKAR. From a careful personal canvass or the trade of this el y. and after miking a summary or the information received from the several lines I reel justified in making the statement that the years bu.-iiu-ss. while it ha? been less profitable, is fairly satisfactory. With some there has been an Increase of business—with many, their trade lud held its own in the aggregate- quite a number h*ve done as much businewin vol ume, while it has not aggr- gated as much as last year; the decline in the coast value of Iheir goods, however, more than covers the apparent difference in the two years' business. lhc dryness of the forepart of the season, the one-halt f,.ilure of the wheat crop and the ruling of low prices, the low price lor bora and nearly all other products ot this locality, aud the devastation of the grasshoppers, gave the year a doubtful outlook ; consequently there was great caution exern-ed on the part ot the l>est country pur chasers, hs their local trade promised light and financially clo«*. There have been many more failures than usual among the financially weak of the country trade, many of them "throwing up their bands ' early in the season. The more favorable features 01" the year's business are ■ An advance in price of wheat later in the year ; however now again declined. The wool pro ductwaa more, and. owing to less rankuess of the feed, it was mncll cleaner; wool brought 50 per cent, more than la.st year. An inert ase of trade territory souih and on the line of the San Joaquin and Siena Nevada Railroad : a build lngupof lhc northern part or this Swte conse quently there were an increase of distributing points anil local dealers ; a partial return to this point of the trade of the State of Nevada-their natural point of supply, if tide-water and thn i:i;h lreight rates from the East are any guaranty whatever tor trade center* When goods cm X , irom the hastern sea-boards to points in central .Nevada, or from San Francisco to 1 tah, and then be returned to these same points, instead ol being sent from this market something to wrong somewhere." The trade of western and central Nevada should never have been lorced to eees supplies elsewhere and the return of this desirable trade calls for mutual conoessioi 1 irom all concerned. There is no question but that the increased work being done at the railroad shops here has given many men labor, which, as formerly, h;:^ i;^...ii!v helped the city local trade generally. ISO QCKRtOK OF (TAKCFACTDBES. The subject of manufacture should be studied by all men having tbe welfare of the citj at heart. We have now three flouring mills, with all of the latest improved machinery, with mill tag c .parity of a thousand barrels of Hour per day. I have no time ii"» to' further specify.the other important and growing manufacturing interests of the eiiy, but would say that recent ly there have been Inquiries from Eastern nun in regard to certain city locations, as to their availability tor manufacturing purposes. It seems tome thai nich enterprises could be fos tered in no better way tbanto have acommittt c appointed by the Board to gather and classify lull statistics of the entire business of the 1 ;;•.'• to invite correspondence from parties desiring to locate manufactures, and to see that such in" quiiies arc candidly and promptly answered, ouch a committee Could assist in procuring lo calities, could ascertain if in any way the city could iclease such enterprises from dty taxa tion for ;; short period during tbe adjustment of the City debt, or while such industries were get ting on a tinn basis. Such a committee might! ascertain, ulso, to what extent will the fad that the railroad company wi 1 bring the raw ma terial to this point and distribute the manufac tured articles h&ve b bearing on their making through freight rates from the fast on the same kind of goods, at such a rate as v. ill tairU pro tect such industries and build up the state. I have beard it stated in our own city in some cases minimum freight rates f-oin the East were working a hardship. Couidering the well- Itnow 11 fact that many Eastern dealers consider California a good dumping ground for their ex ivss siocks. it is cisy to see now extremely low west-bound triicht rates assist them to do such discreditable and disturbing business at less Kiss to themselves. A general interchange of ideas and facts with other manufacturing locations | and Interests, will enable a proper presentation ' of all such matters to be made to those who hold tbe situation, and doubtless would bring about proper adjustments of many of the dif lieu. LABOR ami rii:: . uiM>i:. The question of manufactures lead* us righl up to another one of Bill I greater importance, •un! that is the labor question.

FUUTT SIUPPDJG. The recent Fruit-Growers' Convention, held at San Francisco, brongat out much of interest relating to that question, and also much in formation of value to this city and locality. It seems thai last year there were Bhipped Ka^t from this State 1,025 carloads of green fruit; of this aggregate 800 carloads went Cram sacra mento; lIT cars ..f fruit went forward with pas si ngcr trains, aud '>7s carloads wire attached to freight trains. The city of Denver took 228 car loads, all from freight trains; Chicago took 215 carloads from freight trains, and 314 carloads from passenger trains. The two points received and distributed 757 carloads, being In round Bguret three-fourths of the entire fruit consign ments from our State. From tke above. I con clude that low freight rates are a great help in Increasing the trade. That the sect! r the country tributary to this point is the fruit sec tion, and that its production is fairly cared for in the way of having the same shipped; also that of the many cities Kast. Denver and Chicago alone have been [airlygriped with our fruit. Many of us know that a Chicago fruit shipper has foi a few years past been making this point bis headquarters: furthermore, that two orthree of our city fruit-shipping tirmn have visited cer- I tain points at the East, made business commu- ' nications. and have been quietly at work; these ! three or lour linns have been making fruit ship. | ping a specially. Probably most of the fmit shipping has been done by then:. Doubtless it has taken much time, trouble ami anxiety to ac complish what they have. The late Fruit .rowers. rowers' Convention, at Ban Francisco, gath ered comfort from the fact that the Chi caso shipper had told somebody that his house had in a few years made a good slake out of a moderate capital invested 111 fruit sliip pfne. An honest miser in the new Xl Dorado ot Trinity c.unity while bear bunting might in a fall uproot a maiizanitu bush and find a "lead" that, if well followed, would make him n bank president In one year, and nothing would be thought of it; but to have a Chicago man get aristocratic and happy on 1 alifornia I green fruit shipping awakens enterprise. lel ! us be thankful that it was a Chicago man who has done so well dealing with us, for had it been a St. Louis man be would not have "gien it away," and the rich, luscious-looking fruit that now hangs so bountifully in the corporation true of the "California Fruit L'nion' might still be in the delicate and doubtful blossom ; but I have heard it said that Denver last year was adumping-ground tor fruit. Fruitgrowers' and fruit-snippers' consignments had conflicted. The result was an Increase of the volume ot business, more varied experience, but less com fort to growers and shippers. Ifthe late confer ence shall cause the fruit to be better grown, gathered and picked, lower rates of freight, more careful competition between the consign ments of the shippers and their established trade aud the consignments or the growers, and more Eastern markets to lie tve-tempted with our fruits at fair rates, most everybody will be more or less benefited. If Denver and Chicago, so far away, consume so much of our fruit, can not we expect a large trade with Oregon and Washington Territory, when we have rail com munication with then.? Ry early train they can receive our fruit with the morning dew on it. (By evening train we can scud them the autiooto.j 

TIIK CALIFORNIA ANII OItEOON KAII.KOAI". This Board has at diflerent times made efforts to lurlher the interest bearing on the complc- 1 tion of the Californiaand Oregon Kailroad. Our last effort was made the early part of the cur- | rent year. The Qoveimneul ofhcial declines to I confirm to the railroad company beyond Red- | ding the lands that belong to the company, as j per the terms of the bill of Congress authorizing the building of the road. He claims that the | time tor construction has lapsed, and, with it. the land grant. Doubtless the point is legally I well taken. However, let us look at the matter j from a practical point for a moment. Ibe situa tiou appears to be about tiis: The railroad j company agreed with ihe General "iovcrnment i to e..nstru#t a first-cla.«s railroad from Koseville , to the Oregon state line, the com pan v to furnish everything, but 10 do the work in a certain time. '■ Tlih Government was to give the builders every j odd s-ectlou of uuoccupied land situate at a cer tain distance fr m the road, deeming that to have the country develop d. and all the lands made available and useful, would justify the ! venture thai the l-overjuwent was supposed to ! make. According to the original contract, the road is finished to Redding, or fifty per cent, of the distauce The railroad has "spent about tnirty-five percent, of the money that they con tracted to sp-.ud. as it has been, so far, over a comparatively level valley, the re t is very heavy work. The Government official has con- j firmed to the company about eighty per cent, of the kiud grant. We all know that those vail-y lands already confirmed were valuable, and the mountain lands will be wortn something when | the road is completed. There is, therefore, un- [ finished C*J \<cr cent, of distance, 6f> per cent, of railroad Cum yet to be spent, aud 20 per ceut. of i Government land yet to be confirmed, in order , to bring darkness into light, and scud the voice i ot civil-.zation into a wilderness. Ifthe Govern ment hud withheld all title to the land from the riilroad company until the completion of the contract, or if it had compelled the company to commence at the State line and work it is way, the banrain would have been such an one that it would be keenness tor the Govtrnm'nt to BOW live up to the letterof the contract. But the situation now should quiet the voice of the Government and gaiter alike, .t would bo Bhtcwdnesa for the Government to engage Shoel's Cfcicf Engiueer to take the General Lind Agent of the Central Pacific Company up to the top of Mount sn.isti and offer him. tx-dides the : odd seciions, all the land "there is in sight." if his company will finish the road. When the • contract was done, sv.d the Land Agent called for the title, ;ae Chief, could say to him : "Sire on a former occasion, when your Savior cor nered me, I devised a document thrall similar situations: take this ■ quit-claim deed; 1 it is good ; everybody takes it." A personal inspec tion of the upper portion oi the road now will suggest to a practical mind that when the company finishes the road, pays reason able State and comity taxes thereon and that other uucertaiu levy which eight feet of annual ramtall on a mountain side yielding road-bed will make, they should secure large benefits from the "promised land" beyond the State line, .-uch future and doubtful relief however, does not justify any shirking or bud faith on the part of the Government or the peo ple. Seriously, the great importance of inter state commerce, the benefit that the Govern ment and peoi.le will get by continuing the ! contract, the equiiies of the situation all de j maud that we make every effort possible \ through our Congressmen to have the lime ex tended to the company in which to finish the contract, or to have some other means devised that will aflord relief or assistance to this great est of railroad undertaking!!. By r.roperlv tr, at mg such an enterprise, other capitalists" of the State may be induced to extend the Northern California itailroad from Oroville up the north fork of the Feather river through the Predonia pa.-s, where the elevation is some 5,000 feet ; thence via Goose lake, the southca-t corner of Lake county. Oregon, across Baker county down Ihe Malhetir river to near the mouth wh< re a junction could be made with the Oregon short hue. Survey* show that this road would be about 4flo miles long; that it can be built on a maximum grade of sixty feet to the mile and a maximum of nine degrees. Its construction would open up an immense territory, now with out mil accommodation?, ami would give us direct communication with Eastern Oregon Idaho, Montana and Washington Territory. Tin: iMm>vi:.MK.\T or xirr aivxa. A subject of the greatest Importance to the future of this State, and especially to this local ity, is the nv. r improvement question. For a new .state, comparatively, this question now comes early to the front Having in view tl.e withholding of H n appropiiation already made by Congress, which could be Died on the river and also the taut that Congressman Bndd had ii bill introduced into Congress appropriating buoo.Oi 0 more lor the improvement at the rivers near us, a year ago 1 said, referring to the debiis and river questions: •'There should now be unity ol action. Litigation has fettled the dis puted points, and those successful committees that I.me been so long contesting should now demand the judicious expenditure by the Gov ernment ol the money for the purpose for which it was appropriated; and also the sums asked 1 tor to be liKe expended, and thereby secure the > moral support, as well as the protection of tbe Mate and Government, which such an expend iture would naturally guarantee." Confirmlue Hiis expression then made. I now desire to en large upon the subject just a little. In the orig inal contract be: ween the State and the General Government, the latter reserved the ownership ol the rivers and guaranteed their free naviga tion to the people. Whatever ignorance the ! proper officials ol the Government may have been in regarding the damages being done to the rivers of California, «r whatever doubt or complication tbe new question of debris dam age to water ways may have gotten into' I.v reason of this State having been admitted into the Union us a mining State and by common consent that interest being rec ognized as the leading one, aftei a portion of i the people of the state had contested the nues tion In the Federal and State Courts and tWe courts had caused to in- made official the proper Information thai injury was being done to the rivers and harbors, mid furthermore that such injury cause should cease, all excuse for Igno rance or inactivity on the part of Government officials ended. Therefore, after tha Judge Tem ple decision, no official of any department of the General Government wasjustifl d in farther de clining to render all assistance in his power to prevent further damage being made or to pro ceed to repair injuries already done. All mon eys thai the citizens of those few communities have been, from self-preservation, compelled to spend since the Temple derision, in order to enforce the benefits of that decision, eaid to be about hull a million dollars, is a legitimate ' claim against the General Government, and i should lie at once presented for adjustment and ■ liquidation. 1 have not time to discuss this feature of the question further, but assert 4hat there are many precedents to warrant Govern ment officials, where Government interests are at stake, to protect its interests and prosecute the private citizen in order to maintain and ex ecute both Congressional enactments and com mon lsV. At present we have the remsikable situation of private citizens doing the work of their Government, and at the same time they and their neighbors are being deprived of repair i. lii ralrcadyappropriatcd.and which thousands ol citizens situated near other rivers of the lard are constantly receiving, lean readily under stand how inaction on the part of the General mi at could be i instrued by the hydrau lic miners as a license to continue work, ' :.t do notseehon reclamationdoi v ;lw rivers by tbe Government could be so i onstrued. ;■ Sep tember ibis Board invited the < ■ ugn .;.■ v fotnthla stale and representative men from Ban l-ranclsco, Stockton, and othi r ran- of the country, numbering about Bfty.totakeasteamer trip oi observation up the Sacramento r.-.vr f.on this ]Kiint to ths mouth of the F< river.

It is our privilege and our duty to urge our Congressmen to at one- act in concert with similar interests of the country and secure a large appropriation for the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and their tributaries. Allow me to give a few reasons for a united, energetic effort in this direction: <)n September 3d and I 4th there was held In St. Paul. Minnesota a " Northwestern Water-Ways (lonvention." The committee appointed by the Convention allotted tothenine States and Territories represented ;i2fi delegates. There were over 800 delegates present, besides visitii g Congressmen from the South and other portions of the country Gov ernment engineers, and other citizens.' They claimed a Convention representing, aside from Alaska, one-fourth of the territory and one f.iurth or the population of the United states The subjects considered were the care and improvement of tbe navigable riven of the Northwest, and the construction of the Henncpin canal, an artificial water-way to ex tend from near flock Island to Bennepin on the Illinois river, thence to Lake Michigan so that the Mississippi and Missouri river trade cm <'et to the seaboard via the lakes of the north Both p opoaitions were unanimously Indorsed after the following and many cither points were brought out : This nation lias passed from a period of poverty toom-of comparative wealth Appropriations in Uiis country lor water-way improvements do not compare with those made by European countries and nations for like work Uiis Government hasgiven hundreds of millions for land gram- and in subsidies to railroad en terprises. These roads, with their "pooling" ■ysiem, prevent the people from getting the benefit 01 close competition, yet are held in check only by the natural water-ways of the country. When navigation closes, the roids frequently double their Ir.-iyht rates. That Slim mer grain freight rates From the Northwest to the seaboard can be reduced one-half by river improvements and the building of the canal to connect the Western rivers with the Northern lakes; that this reduction will allow them to compete in Liverpool with Russian. Austrian and Indian breadstuflß: while the cost o! the canal will befromstn to thirteen million dollars according to its carrying capacity, the- reduction of freight thai its construction will give to the products of that inland empire will save the people thereof some twenty-tour millions of dollars annually (statisticsand figures are given for Ihis statement); India is engaged in con structing waterways for the transportation of her products; that the Ni rthwest contributes largely to the revenues of the ' tovernment: that thin nation has a ready spent about USO Oijo non on the Western waterway-, the most or It on the I pper Mississippi, and hence has recognized the importance of the work, and was committed to s;ill greater outlay; that the Gov ernment engineer* had approved the work General New ton having ust estimated t.iat from frI."i.OW),CUO to $_«i.Ou*i,oOf) is required to con tinue the present work l>eing done on the rivers and harbors. They ask for $7,000,000 alone tor the improvement of the Missouri river, which is one of the most treacherous rivers of the earth. Senator Eustis, of I^uisiana, said to them that the South favored such waterway improve ments. They claim that Congress has the power, and that it is its duty to thoroughly en gage in such work; llmt they desire to work in harmony with all sections of the country hav ing equitable claims for such improvements to be made; that Congress shall not pas.-, river and ha-bor improvement biilsunless their wants are favorably considered. The Convention elated alter adopting unanimously about eighteen lengthy resolutions. The portion most interest ing to us is: Wiieueap, In crJer to secure to the producers cl this country the highest posj-ible return for their products, to receive in return the ex changes for the same at the most favorable rates, and to sustain our proper relations to foreign markets, the cost of transportation must be re duced to the minimum. R'tolved, That all naturally navigable water ways and harbors of the Piiited .-tales should be thoroughly and extensively improved; that ce:tain artificial waterways should be con structed: that t°.'r>,OoO,oiiQ per year for such im provements would not l>e an extravagant appro priation on the part of the General Government. We comment many of their points to the csreful consideration of Messrs. McKenna, Mor row, Loutit, and their fellow-Congrcssnieu from this State. By the way, there ts no man among a'l our able and representative delegation to Congress, whose national reputation, whose great breadth of character, and whose peculiar relations to this important question, will enable him to do man lor us, and who will do it with less urging, than our ereat benefactor, and new United States Senator, the Hon. I-oland Stanford. I have been a little lengthy in Retting to you my synopsis of the proceedings ot the St. Paul ■ Convention of last September, but it show* how ! the people of the great heart of this nation view ■ question which greatly interests 11?.
