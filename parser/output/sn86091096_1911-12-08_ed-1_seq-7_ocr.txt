S2ND SESSION OF CONGRESS CONVENES Regular Session Opened Mon day With Prospects of Pro tracted Meeting. Ws shington.—The first regular ses sion of the Sixty second Congress opened Monday. Having perfected its organization when it met in extraor dinary session last spring, Congress was ready to begin work. Investigate Anti-Trust League. An investigation of the operation of tile so-called Anti-Trust League was demanded by Republican Leader Mann iu the House at the opening session, after a remarkable speech by Repre sentative Martin W. Littlpton, of New York, who charged Henry B. Martin, secretary of the league,-with attempt ing to defame him. Mr. Littleton as sailed Martin and others as in con spiracy to use the Steel investigating committee to depress the value of stocks in Wall Street. President Upholds Sherman Law. President Taft in his message stat ed that, owing to the number of im portant subjects calling for comment, it was impossible to include a discus sion of them in one message of rea sonable length and, therefore, he would transmit a series of messages between the opening of Congress and the adjournment for the Christmas holidays. His first message dealt with anti trust legislation. The President stated that he was strongly opposed to the repeal or amendment of the Sherman law, and suggested that the law should be strengthened by supplemen tal legislation. He urged the enact ment of some sort of federal Incorpor ation act and the creation of a federal corporation commission. Must Do Over Extra Session Work. Much of the work of the extra ses sion which President Taft called in order to pass the Canadian reciprocity agreement, must be done over again. The President vetoed the tariff revi sion bills passed by the Democrats and the Republican Insurgents, and both factions are armed for the fray once rpore. The Democrats have a good work ing majority in the House, and the important bills on their program will be passed quickiy. Tariff and constructive corporation legislation are the two items of gen eral Interest standing out from the rest In the line of serious business. As soon as President Taft eends In his tariff message, following the report made to him by the tariff board, the Democrats of the ways and means committee will shape their program. It Is practically assured that whatever the ways and mean« committee puts forward, whether wholly en rapport with the tariff board findings or not, will pass the House. Many Tariff Bills Coming. The probability la that there will be a series of measures revising vari ous schedules In conformity with the plan followed last summer. The real tariff fight will follow in the Senate with the result uncertain now and with the impending complications wearying to contemplate in view of the balance of power held by the In surgents and the lack of harmony In the ranks of the Senate Democrats. The corporation legislative prob lem Is even more vexing than that pertaining to the tariff. The Presi dent and his friends are hopeful that non partisan public sentiment will force the parties to co-operate and place a federal corporation law on the statute hooks. Panama Canal Legislation. The coming session is expected to ! develop the first legislation for the operation, maintenance and govern ment of the Panama canal and the canal zone. Everything that Congress has done in the past regarding the great artificial waterway htjs been di rected toward construction. The question of tolls for use of the canal and its permanent fortification are two of the big subjects that It is ex pected will be embodied in legislation introduced during the session. It is not believed, however, that much leg islation will be passed on the future of the canal, it being attempted large ly as a formative precaution to test the sentiment toward the different (Ians suggested. Will Do Little Bafora Holiday*. But little conatructlve legislation la expected before the Chrlatmas Holi days. After the reading of the Presi of a j ! 1 settled down to the Introduction of bills and preliminary skirmishing In advance of the real battle that will begin after the Christmas recess. The House Democrats will then plunge at once into the consideration of the tariff revision bills and the an nual appropriation measures. The re port of the tariff board on the whole schedule will be submitted shortly after Congress convenes. Man Shot, Wanders in Desert. Richfield.—His right cheek and jaw bone blown away by* the contents of a shotgun In the hands of his "pals" when they quarreled over a division of the booty secured from the post office of Picabo, Harry Barton, of Boise, is lying between life and death at a hospital here. Barton was de serted after being shot and left to wander over the treacherous lava-bed country for hours with half his face shot away. His comrades, Edward Burke and Fred Murphy, are being yheld by the authorities at Halley. 15,000 Cattle Sent by Nampa Man. Nampa.— H. R. Peacock, Nampa's well-known cattle buyer and shipper, has this year shipped 15,000 head of cattle. Of this number about 6000 head were shipped east, and 8000 wereC shipped to Portland. Hogs at Lewiston Exhibition. Grangeville. — Three carloads of hogs and cattle will be shipped from Grangeville to Lewiston for exhibi tion at the Northwest Live Stock As sociation meeting this month. Forger Will Meet Opposition. Wallace.—When D. A. Allere, con victed of forgery In the local district court last January, appears before the Idaho board of pardons next April to seek a release he will be met by op position from looal officials. Frenoh Are Interested In Suit. Pari*.—All France is interested in the suit tor alienation of her bus band's affections brought by the wife of Professor Langevln against Mad ame Curie. A great portion of the public, including scientists and many government officiels, sympathise with Madame Curl« and are endeavoring to shield her name and raputetton Worse Still. They tell me Simpkins' wife Is a perfect tyrant. The poor fellow actu ally goes around, they say, without a nickel in his pockets." "Worse than that—she's cut off his supply of pockets."—Cleveland Plain Dealer. Few, if any, medicines have met with the uniform success that has attended the use of Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. The remarkable cures of colic and diarrhoea which it has effected in almost every neighborhood have given it a wide reputation. For sale by Albert Moshon. J. T.
