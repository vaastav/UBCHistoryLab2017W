Frank 3otch Is beginning to think of quitting tho wrestling game. When in Cleveland last week ho said: "About two more big matches and I guess I'll quit for good. I hav threatened to do so for a year or now, but it is great fun going about the country and meeting all comers Hut as long" as I rose' as the chain pion and anyone comes alonj; who looks us if ho had a chance to take the title nwny from me, I will wrestle him. Hut about two more hard matches and I will be willing to h Mtrneone else take tho champion ship." fiotch does not pay, so, but he lias been systematically training to tackh tho huge foreigners who havo been .invadinir America.

CONFERENCE "BIG EIGHT" MAY BAR WOLVERINE TEAM Chicago, Dec. 17. Football coaches nnd managers of the conference schools will meet at tho Auditorium hotel next Thursday to settle definitely the inter collegiate turmoil over next seasons battles. The question of Michigan games nnd problems bearing on the continuance of friendly relations in the "Fiig Fight" will be up for decision. The local athletic authorities re ceived their ' notifications this week. Nehlnd tho ostensible purpose of the gathering Is tho question whether any of the Itig Fight schools will follow Minnesota's lead In playing the Wol verines will come to show-down. While the coaches will not enter Into nny open negotiations regarding the undeslrabllity or playing Michigan it will be understood that no school fhould give Michigan a date in nny branch of sport until she returns to the conference. Minnesota may h given a hint that she should not renew her contract with Michigan, It 1 thought. The Gopher action In playing Mich igan nt this time has never been quite understood by some of the schools nnd It Is possible that tho Gophers will "t least be asked to explain. OTTAWA REGISTERS KICK. Hockey Team Wants to Play in Same League With Wanderer. Ottawa. Dec. 17. The present situ ation In the Canadian hockey world Is far from satisfactory to the Ottawns nnd It Is fully oxpeotMl that before January comes around there will he n shake-up. Tho fact that Wander ers nre In the National League Is dis appointing, for Ottawa nnd Wander ers were the biggest drawing cards in either Ottawa or Montreal. The ef forts of tho Ottawa s, therefore, are being directed towards the breaking up of both leagues nnd the formation nt ene strong league. It Is regarded as certain that this wl be accomplished. A delegation from Ottawa will visit Montreal early this week and open negotiations. The feeling here Is that Ottawa would pre fer to he in the same league with the Wanderers, nnd as this feeling grows. It Is possible that a one-leignc tlon will be effected by the defection

Stagg returned to the I'niversity of Chicago campus with a aurich of qualified compliments for the game of Canadian Rugby football he saw in New York last Saturday. Ho l.aracteilzed the spectacle as fast and inlen sting at times, hut old-fashioned and lacking In science. The Maroon coach gave out a care ful statement, in which he refrained from going on record ns for or against tho Canadian game, but In which he outlined the essential features of the play for the benefit of western root ers. Coach Stagg wished to hear criticisms and arguments over the game, which he believes is practically unknown In this section. Coach Stagg was not Impressed by the game on many technical points, lie found the play of the backs slow and without spirit, tho charging slow and tho tackling without nggresslve-ncj;c Calculating Meanness. "I suppose you heard what Mean ley did In church last Sunday whet tho plato ruinb round to him? "Dropped a button In It, I suppose.' "Worse than that. He leaned over nnd whispered: I paid the pastor's cut fare yesterday. We'll call it square.' " Catholic Standard and Times. Subscribe for The Mews.

Come nil ye patriots who would know the real se cret of Undo Joe's power! lie has 1 ei n using stovaine on hi constitu ency and members of congress for th" last 34 years and this Is why he Is still heie. No, kind friend, stovalno Is n t j brand of stove polish. It Is the new anesthetic used so successfully by Dr. Joiuiesco, the Roumanian, who demon strated Its practicability in New York last week. Stovaine has the same ef fect on the patient as opium but the patient under tho knife knows what 1.'. going on all the while. Now just between . s'l'l".

At hast 34 year' before t In Roumanian scientist made !i practical test, l'n -1 Joe was using it effectually f ut In Il linois on his constant 'ills. Some of his patients have n t tnk n kindly the dost' but Dr. (inn..n h is contimn d Ms practice with varying" decrees of f.uccess for almost n life time. Now that the truth is out about the ypoaker It is highly probable that the new anaesthetic will be used In i!n senate and in cabinet circles. The "standpatters" would like to try It out in MucVcngh this very hour. This brings out some interesting gossip i f importance.
