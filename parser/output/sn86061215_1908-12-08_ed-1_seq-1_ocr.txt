It is surmised that the person who did it was an expert at: the business and played it smoothly. The First National is one of the strongest banks in all northwestern Iowa and handles a great deal of money during any business dayt and its officers and especially the cashier and assistant cashier, have prided themselves on the great care they have exercised in handling cash at ail limes during banking hours. The loss of the money itself is a very small matter to so strong a bank as this but the part hardest, for the bank people to stand is that the money was taken right from under their eyes.
