Iu the exercise of my host discretion, I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by t!ie insurgents, instead of putting in force by proclamation the lw of Con gress enacted at the late session for closing the, ports also. Obeyins the dictates cf prudodee, as well as the obligations of law, instead of trin- neending, 1 havo adhered to the net of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a now law upon the same subject shall be proposed, Z its propriety will be duly considered. The Union must bo preserved, and hence all indispensable means muat be employed. Wo shall not be in hrtste to determine what radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, 'are ihdesnensable. The inaugerul address at the begining of the administration, and the message to Congress at the late special session, were both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy out of which the in surrection and consequent war havesprunj. Nothing now occ,"i to ad J or subtract to r from the principles or general purposes stated and expressed iu thoso documents. The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peacebly, expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter, snd a general review of what lias occurred since may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then is touch better defined and moi c distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of - the Union were not free from apprehension on this point. This, however, was soon settled definately, and on the right side. South of the line, noble little Delaware led off, right from the first Maryland was made to seem against the Union. Our soldiers weie assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many days, at one time, without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and cpened to the Government. She already gives seven regiments to the Union and none to the enemy, and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union by a lrc zr.cjc::ty, and larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly, and, I think, unchange ably ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet, and, I l.elieve. cannot attain be overrun bv the insurgents. These three States of Mary-! land. Kentucky ami Missouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, bare now an aggregate of not less than 40,000 in the field for the Union, while, of iheir citizens, not more than a third in number are among the insurgents, and they of doubtful whereabouts and existence. - - After' a somewhat bloody struggle of months, w.nter closes on the I nion people of Western Virginia, leaving them ma-ters of their own' 'country. An insurgent force of about 1,500, for months dominating the small peninsula region constituting the counties of Acconiac and Northampton, and known as the Eastern Shore of Vir ginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there have renewed their allegiance to. and accepted the protection of, the old flag. This leaves no armed insurrection north of the Potomac or cast f the Chesapeake. Also, we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the Southern coast, of Ilatteras, Port b'oyal, Tybee Idand, near Savannah, and Ship Island, and likewise have some geneiv.l accounts of popular movements iu beli-df of the I nion m North Carolina and Tennessee. These taings demonstrate that the cause ! of the Unioa southward. is advancing steadily Since yoi:r last adjournment Lit utenant General Scott has retired from the head of the army. Duriuiz his Ioni hfo tlip nation h is mt been unmindful of his merit, yi on railing to mind how faithfully. nb ct lv and brilliantly he has served the country, from a time far back in our history, when few of the now living had been born, and thCucC forward continually, I cannot but think we are stiil Lis debtor. I submit, therefore, " for your consideration, what further mark of recognition is due to him, and to ourselves a.5 a grateful people. Avith the retirement of Gen. Scott came the executive duty of appointing in his stead a Geueral-in Chief of the army. It is gratifying that neither iu-council nor country was there, so far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper Ierson to be selected. The retiring Chief repeatedly expressed LU judgment in favor of General McClellan forthe posi tion. And in this the Nation seemed to giro an unanymous concurrence. The designation of General McCIellaa is, there fore, in a considerable degree, the selection of the country as well as of the Executive, and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given him the confidence and cordial support, thus by f:dr implication promised, and without which he cannot, with so full efficiency, serve the country! It has been said that one bad General is better than two good ones ; and tho saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is Iietter directed by a single mind, though inferior, than by two supe rior ones at variance and cross purposes. An l the same is true in all joint opera tion, wherein thoso engaged can have none bnt a common end lif view, and can differ only as to the choice of means. In a storm at sea. no oe on board can wish tho hin to sink, and yet, not unfeequent ly. :'l go down together, because too many w.li ' d rect, and no single mini can be all ).red to control. It contiaues to develope that the insur rection is largely if not exclusively a war npoa the first principles or popular government the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered d.x: unients, as well as the general tone of the insurgents. In these documents we find the -abiding enmity of the existing riht of suffrage the denial to the people of all t- participate in the election of public officers, except the Legislative body advocated with labored arguments to prove that large control of the Government in tfie people is the source of all political evil. ' Monarchy itelf is sometimes hinted at asa possible refuge from the power of the people. In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning against this approach of returning despotism. It is not needed, nor fitting htre, that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions, but there is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to nhieh I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if not above, so far in the structure of Government. It is nvaihihle only ia connection with Capital ; that i nobody labors unless somebody else, own- , ing capital, somehow by the use of i - i . . i . , . . ... induces him to labor. This assumed it is next considered whether it is best that cnpiiai suautiire laborers, snd thus induce j them to work by their own consent, or l.uy tUem snd drive them to it without tbe'r consent Having proceeded so fr, it is naturally concluded that all labou rs are hired laborers, or what we call slaves, an-1 further, it is as umcd that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life. Now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thinji as a freainan being fixed for life in the condi- I tion oj a hired laborer. Both of these assum-rtions are false, ami all inferences from them aro groundless. Labor is prior to, and indepc-udeut of, capitaL Capital, is only the fruit of labor, and could tever Lave existed if labor had not first existed. ..Labor is the superior of capital, andf irves nmch the higher ConsitieiationCapitil ljas its rights which aro as .worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied, that there is, and probably. alwajs. will be, a relation between labor ana -capital producing mutual benefits. Th error ism assuming that tha. wbola labcr of the community exists 9ilhio that relation. A few men own caiMtal, and that few avoid Lbor and 'i1' ' : ' with their capital hire or buy a few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class. Neither work for others nor havo others working for them. In most of the Southern .States a major ity of the whole people of all colors are lu-it er slaves nor masters, while iu the Northern a largo majority are lit-Rher hirers nor hired.- Men with their families, v. ivcs, sons and daughters work for them- ! eelves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to then. selves, ami asking no favors ot capital on the one hand, nor of hired labor er or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital ; that is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy, or hire, others to labor for them ; but this is only a mixed, and not a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class. Ag;iin, as lias already been said, there is not of necessity, any such thing an the free hired laborers being fixed for that condition for life. Many independent niee every where in these States, a few years back in their lives wire lured laborers. The pru dent penilc-ss begins in the world to labor for wages awhile, and soon a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself then labors on his own account, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosper ous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and codsequent energy, progress and improvement of the condition to all. No men lit ing are nioro worthy to be trusted than those who toil up or on from poverty; none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not eotestly earned. Let them bewars of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new dis abilities and burden's upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost. from the first taking of our national cen sus to the Lift are seventy years, ami we hnd our population at the end of the period eight times as great as it was at the be ginning.

In the House 114 old members were present, which with new ones sworn in, made a quorum. The President's message was read on Tuesday, and the usual number of copies ordered to be printed. The business thus far has been impor. taut only as throwing out straws to show which way the wind blows. On the first day indeed the first-hour of the session, Mr. Trumbull gave notice of a bill to con fiscate and give freedom to tho slaves of rebels, and on Thursday he introduced his bill. Considering the quarter it conies from, it is ,quito mederate. It is almost word for word the bill of the Confederate Congress, confiscating absolutely all tho property of persons in rebellion against the government, only adding clauses to include and set free their negroes and providing for their colonization at theeud of the war. Other propositions have been made to have tho President declare by pioclaniation all the slaves free, and pro posing compensation to Union men ; but the bill of Mr. Trumbull seems thu3 far to be the favorite.

With a view to the future safety 6f the Federal capital, it is recjmmendcd that the boundaries of Delewar, Maryland and Virginia be reconstructed.

'I his would be an exception lo the general rule. lie recommends that the District of Co lumbia be restored to its original bounda lies. On the negro question the Secretary makes an approach to tho doctrin of Fre mont's proclamation. lie declares that slaves should share the common fate of all property of rebels. They certainly outfit, so far as tho rebels themsolvcs are con cerned. What shall be done with slavts who shall be abandoned by their misters, is a question to be determined with refer ence to the interestsjof the loyal white people, North and South, and in no man ner with reference to the interests of the tebels. It will notbe for the interests of the loyal white people. North or South, that any great number of the slaves shall be let loose. The Secretary, however, is for giving them freedom, and employing them by tho Government. The scheme of the goverment turning cotton planter, and employing negroes in tho business, is simply impracticable and ridiculous The practical solution of this question is to leave tho disposition of tho negroes of rebels to the States in which they are found after such States shall havo been redeemed from rebellion. As an element in the war, the negroes ore of no conse quence after they havo been abandoned j bv their masters. Before they havo boon j abandoned by them, they are beyond the reach or influence of the government. r iTi.NPY v n EEEcnER has riven aholi t!onJom a si10ck.

There is troub le among tho Generah at Paducah. A week ago, a secessidnist in that city hung a rebel flag out of his window. Gen. Wal lace notified the commandant, Gen. Smith, of the fact, but the latter manifested no disposition to interefere. Thereupon Gcr. i Wallace lent a squad of men who removed the flag and raised the stars and stripes over the building. Tho party were met by one of Gen. Smith's aids with orders to re place tho secession Hag and remove the other. Gen. Wallace declared it should not be done while a man remained alive in his brigade, and that the secessionist should have the honor of sleeping under the union flag, Smith's aid thought that no great honor, whereupon Wallace's aid knocked him down. Thereupon Gen. Smith issued a general order denouncing the occurence, and thrcatcningpunishment for insubordination. Gen. Paine and other commanders sent word to Wallace to keep a stiff upper lip, and that they would stand by him.

To collect volunteers for this purpose depots will be established at prominent points throughout th country, upon which coni min lersof regiments losing men by dis ease or in action will m ike requisitions to fill up their broken ranks. The Domestic Tvrant. It is to me a thoroughly disgusting sight to see, as wo sometimes do, the wile and family kept in constant terror cf the sel lish bashaw at tha head of the house, and ever on the watch to yield in every petty manner to his whims and fancies. Some times, where he is a hard wrought ami anxious man, whose hard work earns his children's bread. Mid whose life is the sole stay, it is needful that ho should bo defer red to in many things, lest the overtasked brain and overstrained nervous system should break down or grow unequal to the task. But 1 am not thinking of such cases. I mean cases iu which the head of tne family is a great, fat, bullying, selfish scoundrel, who devours sullenly the choice dish at dinner, and walks into all the fruit or desert, while his wife looks on in silence, and the awe-stricken children dare not hint that they would like a little of what tho brute hound is devouring. I mean cases in which the contemptible dog is extremely well dress d, while his wifeand children's attire is th n and bare; in which he liberally tosses ah ut his money in the billitrd room, and g:es oil" iu the autumn for a tour on tho continent by himself, leaving them to the joyless routine of their unvaried life. It is sad to see the sudden bush that fidls upon tho little things when he enters the house; how their sports are cut short, ami they try to steal away from tho room. Would that I were ihe Emperor of Kussia, and such a man my su'iyeet! Nhould not he tas,te the knout? bhoulil not I make hilni howl ? That would be his suitable punish ment; for he will never feel what worthier mortals would regard as the heavier pen alty by far, the utter absence of confidence or real affection between him and the children when they grow up. He will not min i that there never was a day when the toddling creatures set upashoutof delight at his entrance, and rushed at him, and scaled him, and searched in his pockets, and pulled him about; nor that day will never come, when, growing into men and women, they will come to him for sympa thy and guidance in their little trials and perplexities. Oh 1 woeful to think that thero are pareuts, held m general estima tion too, to whom their children would no more think of going to for kindly sympa thy than they would think of going to Jtfova Zc-nibla for warmth. Country Parson. The Chicago Journal. We havo cvjoyed a regular exchange with, and per consequence the reading of tho Chicago Journal for the last 1$ years; and although during that length of time, n-e have often widely differed with the editors in political views, this at least we are compelled to say, that the Journ-l never forfeited our respect as an able, fair, candid, and steadily consistent advocate of Whig principles. Time, the great set tler, has disposed of most of tho issues, that in former days divided tho whigs fromthe democrats, and other party names and issues have arisen. But while a large proportion of the old whig party, in a. suming new party names, have yielded to the temptations of expediency and ofiieial pelf, and forgotten their former .n'ic-.f, such a change can scarcely be brought against tho Journal. That disgraceful finale of the old whig party, of being '' merged into a miserable abolition fac tion," which Henry Clay so much depre cated, the Journal has stoutly and persist ently resisted. And so the time lias come around that we find ourselves, though consistent democrats, agreeing with the ' commercial departments is behind none of i of its Chica-o cotemporaries, whiie in the ,.".,,.., , " "mlui " j tant points like M asliington, St. Louis, I r, it is ahead of some of them.

If, .' !i ... ,..,...--.. t a.,.u nuiixsui mem : however brief or unpretending, (.if this : class is a short article, in your issue of ! -ov. JiJ, lrom the pen ot one of the Fro lessors of the ae. Some invidious icr- son :s insinuate that the Tiofessir n ields an I , , . . , . ,, i p ueked per., even citing this excellent , HI) ITo luction as evidence that it is yet in the service of the original proprietor. Wo spurn the insinuation. These shallow critics fail to look beneath the surface ami detect the beauties, all concealed, in which the article abounds. True, most of the sentences are not constructed in accord ance with recognized principles of gram- lliar. But nothing can be more absurd i than to expect a writer of genius to con form to thoso rules that grammar-makers lay down and theuninspired follow. True, also, in that complex something teruisd style, the IVof 's article differs from any thing we recollect of reading before. But. every great writer has a stylo of his own in other words, has an individuality, that cannot fail to manifest itself in the pro ductions of his pen. Macauley's style is unlike Hume's, .Seward's unliks" Webster's, Everett's unlike li ving's, and tho Profes sor's unlike that of either of these scarcely more famous personages. It must be re membered that genius is not imitative, but inventive. That the first sentet co is needlessly complex, and the succcssk n of sounds in "pertains"' and " pertaining" not altogether agreeable to the ear, must be conceded; but the declared opposition to newspaper controversy, tho purpose to correct a false impression, and the deter mination to let facts have their own weight now that election has passed, all which are highly commendable, should preclude harsh criticism. Tho same trilling objec tions may bo mado to the second paragraph. None will fail to admire, how ever, the generous forbearance shown in not writing an article for the llrpuhlkan during the canvass. Tho briefest produc tion from tho Professor's pn, in tho trenchant style of the one published just after election, would, doubtless, have an nihilated his "illiterate'' competitor and prevented the "disgraceful result" so much deplored. " Neither did I ever cross tho Illinois river to canvass, or contradicted false hood " This clause is not quite grammati cal nor superfluously elegant. It shows, however, that confidence in the good peo ple so characteristic of generous minds confidence, it must be admitted, sadly misplaced in this instance. The assertion made by some, that the Professor was too busy in the coal banks to canvass south of the Illinois, is undeserving of notice. It is not to be believed, for a moment, that he would solicit votes of those base fellows who "howled" at him for being a " bible-readcr." Other little inelegancies are met with : to wit: "As you say, what you said" "which wa that I was "ousted notwith standing my preposition was," "request, sent to ine by your Clerk, requesting It by the, wor.l 'Superintendent' is meant to understand tho Superiutemiency," Ac.- The Professor, doubtless, el ls iu supposing th.it sunerinter.deiit and superiiitendeiiev i : , , . . ... 1. ..... .m...,.,. ..,., a , .t I .. tt.i j '.-. nuiit iiiuu-t n ... ..w... . to adopt his own idiom, that the one may be meant to understand by the other. The subject of 'is meant,' too, is left in some doubt. TIips errors, however, if they deserve to be called errors, are the merest trifles and detract little from the general merits of the composition. The reader fond of originality will be delighted with the proposition. Two or more sentences iu one paragraph are com mon ; but two p.iragrapiis in a single sen tence are very rare. Indeed, we don't re member of meeting before with a similar instance in any good writer. The end in view in publishing the proposition is set forth with unusual clearness. It is to ' show where the truth lies. ' Now, what ever inelegance of diction or originality in respect of syntax may be found in the proposition itself, none will deny to the writer the most flattering success in achieving the object of its publication. " The above is the only proposition of mine that was before that Loard or that ever came from my hand at the time the change was made in the Columbus street school, which sum. Ac. The harmony of this sentence would, undoubtedly, be pro moted by suppres.-ifig a few of the mis chievous tfiat' -i which infer t it. The office of which,' too, is not quite clear. " My proposition" his bid." This dis tinction, invariably made between the Pro fessor's oiler and that of his successor is thought by some to be in bad taste. On the contrary, we maintain that it is good taste indeed, in exquisite taste. The most conelu-rve reasons can be given for h- Tho Li'1 is f'jr .r,inc ' ku'idreJ dollars, ! the vmt.-n proi-o-ition for a thousand. Ti(! bid is very brief, hardly a dozen ' words.
