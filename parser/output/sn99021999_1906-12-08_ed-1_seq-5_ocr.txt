Consul Talks of- Meaaage. SAN 

FRANCISCO, Dec. 7. In an inter view published In the Call today bearing on the recommendations made In his message by President Roosevelt on Japanese educa tion and on the segregation of the chil dren In schools. General Uyeno, the consul for Japan here, says; Sentiment Is practically universal among the 10.UC) Japanese in San Francisco that the recommendations mad? by the president constitute the most radical solution of American Japanese problems yet attempted. There is no question but that the bonds be'wen Japan and the Unltel States will be considerably strengthened by conferring tna privilege or franchise on the Japanese In California. There axe some oO.MO Japa nese In the state, and while I am not in a position to say how manv of these would take advantage of naturalisation privileges 1 do think that the number would be com paratively large. Concernmg the sehoo' Segregation ques tion, a lot Is being written and talked about n that Is due to misconception of the facta. I think that the entire matter will be solved satisfactorily. The Japa nese are not striving for anything unrea sonable and are quite willing to let the rafts in the dispute guide whatever deci sion Is to be ultimately rendered. Ne Treaty r-esdln.

In a position Is know all that transpires in his office, today reiterate ths statement that nothing of the kind has ever been thought of. Asalatant Secretary Adee, who has been credited with having been assigned the taak of preparing such a treaty, said to day: "It la all conjecture. I know absolutely nothing tending to confirm the report of any such treaty being negotiated." Asalatant Secretary Bacon made a state ment on behalf of the president that no steps of any kind had been taken or will be instituted with a view to the negotia tion of a new treaty with Japan for the exclusion of Japanese laborers.

RIVER MEN AT WHITE HOUSE Celeeateg to Waterways Concrets Call Upoa Fretdent Roosevelt, ADDRESS BY Tht ,CHiEF 'EXECUTIVE He Says He Is la Fall Sympathy with Parpoae of Convention, bat Can not Endorse Any Definite Plaa. WASHINGTON, Deo. 7.-President Roose velt told the delegates to the national rivers snd harbors convention who called on him at the White House today thai he would consult with the leaders In con gress and expressed the hope that some thing definite and effective could be done In the way of increased appropriations for the Improvement of the nation's water ways. Albert Bettlngfr of Cincinnati, tho spokesman for the convention, advanced the proposition that the natural waterways made efficient by the aid of the govern ment would not only supply the deficiency of transportation facilities, present and prospective, but would so equitably and naturally regulate freight charges as to be most conducive to continued prosperity. He told the president that tne convention suggested regular annual appropriations of not less than J60.OXi.000 to replace the "hitherto desuitory and Inadequate appro priations" for the Improvement of the waterways snd to place their prosecution on a business basis. Insuring their com pletion within a reasonable length of time. Address by President. The president, after expressing his pleas ure at meeting the members of the delega tion, said: I have come to feel a growing sense of the Importance of establishing a far-reaching, coherent plan for Ihe general im provement of the waterways of the coun try. I was first led to consideration of that plan by considering another plan for the use of water not in comtectlon with waterways, but In connection with prepar ing th land at the head of the rivers to produce tne harvests that later in part should be carried on the rivers lower down that Is, In connection .with the Irrigation policy in which I so strongly believe is vital to the welfare of the Kocky moun tain snd adjacent states. Just as I feel that the national government should con cern Itself with utilisation of the water of rivers in their sources where the coun try Is dry, so I feel the natknal govern ment should conoern Itself with ths proper control and utilisation of the water lower down In the river where they are fitted to be the great arteries of communication. I have had it brought strikingly to my at tention but recently how much we suffer at present because of the Inadequate trans portation facilities of the railways for moving the great grain crops and cattle crop of this country. We need snd must have further facilities for transportation and, as has been well pointed out, one of the effective methods of affecting railway rates Is to provide for a proper system of water transportation. It would not be possible for me to enter Into any dlacusmon of the details of our flan until I have spoken with some of the eaders of the two houses of congress. I sh-ill consult with them at once and trust that something definite snd effective can be Cone along the lines that you mention. You understand, gentlemen, I could not, offhund. commit myself to the detHlls of any pulley without taking into consideration what the feeling of the co-ordinate branch would be, and I must be guided largeiy by their views. I am sure that you will find there the genuine, patriotic purpose to do what Is best for the Interest of our common coun try. Former Governor David R. Francis of Missouri presented to the president a large gold medal of the Louisiana Purchase Ex position company, similar to those given t the heads of the different governments of Europe w hich participated In the exposition. J Committee to Bee Congress. The unanimous adoption of the resolution urging congress to appropriate annually not less than 150,000.000 for the Improvement of rivers, harbors and waterways, commencing with the present session, and the appoint ment of a committee of eighteen delegates, headed by Mr. Francis, .to present the sen timent of the convention to the president and to congress, concluded the buslmss proceedings of the body today. The report of J. F. Ellison, secretary-treasurer, was read, showing the financial condition of the congress to be good. The congress has an organization embracing fifty-eight cities and twenty-nine states, or 161 separate as sociations, with a membership of 1,108 Indi viduals. Among the speakers today was P, J.
