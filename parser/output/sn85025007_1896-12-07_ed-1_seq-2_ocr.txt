MONDAY even::: ;, .oec. 7. 18fe6 In ki.-. account of the call Mr. H<*ol2 made upon the President last Saturday evening, the correspondent of a New York newspaper =ays the President, shaking the band o: the man whc~? corruption fund bought the Presidency, is reported to have said : "I wan; U congratulate- you upon the great victo? ry you have won.'" To which Mr Hanna replied : "Tcank you Mr. Presi? dent, but I want to acknowledge th< debt of gratitude Major McKinley anc ?we all owe for the magnificent wori done by =o many democrats like jour fie':." * A Washington newspaper, in its ac count of the same call, =ay= : "Meceri Hanna and Payne, General Porter Chairman Babcock and .Senator Proc ter walked slowly over to the Whi:< House, and were escorted direct U President Cleveland's private office, a; if they had an appointment with him Almost immediately there were sound; of merriment as i: somebody was mak ing fan over the situation.''

These ark no people less disposed to follow the wise advice of their own countryman, Davy Crockett?to dc sure you are right before you go ahead ?than those of the L'nited States. Citi? zen? of other foreign countries have at much, if not more property in Cuba than those of this one, and the consul. of those countries are as much interest? ed in securing the protection of that property and its owners as those of this have in protecting American life and property there. But not only tho3fc consuls, but their governments, being well informed of the actual condition of Cuban ailairs, give Spain their moral support in the effort she is making to suppress the insurrection of her negro anil scalawag BUbjects in Cuba. Some Northern people mix with their abuse of their Southern enforced fellow citizens, for supporting the regu? larly and fairly nominated democratic ticket, at the late election, side slaps at them for expressing a wish that their children may learn the true history ol their country, and not be taught by Northern books that their fathers, whe acted in accordance with the Constitu tion and even with the text books usid at West Point until after the breaking out of the war between the States, were t raitors ami rebels. Their abuse is not objectionable to those at whom it is cast, and true histories of the country will be used iu Southern schools all the same. The second session of the Fifty fourth Congress commenced to-day. It will end ou the 4th of March. It is risking nothing to say that the country will derive uo benefit from it, and, in? deed, if all the regular appropriation bills be passed, it will bo &>> much as in expected. With a monthly deficit of eight million and Mr. Keed ae Speaker of the Hou.se, the chance of any other than the regular appropriation bills being parsed iB poor indeed, and no body ia silly enough to suppose that any thing will be done with either the tarill or cur? rency questions._ 

SOME PEOPLE imagine they see the dawn of the prosperity that was to oc? cur from the election of Mr. McKinley in tho ability of certain cities to float four and five per cent, bonds. They never labored ur.der a vainer ce'.nsioz. ' In 315try 1= so depressed and business I so slack that the few people who have : j money can find no profitable mves:-: men: for it, and have so little confi- ? dence in the promised revival that | they are afraid to lend i: except upon j gilt edzed security, which few can offer. ? City bonds are about the safes: now is? sue.!, and people with money would ln veet it them at even two or three per cent.. rather than iet it iie idle. GovsenoeBuluv of California, at the reo :esl of the President, has reprieved the murderer of four men, for whose mother Mr. Cleveland had ??formed a Kroog s'.ucbi?rL'." before he became President, though his crime was that of a mo:.-ter rather than a man. as he tried to kill a whole train load of people. D jLe of whom had ever seen him, let a.>-c io-e him any injury. In view of this reprieve and of the io?uence that obtained it. is it at all wonderful that so many people have lost faith in free in agitations ?_ In his message to Congress to-day the :J.-^:^en: takes the unwise ground that trusts aDd combinations must be suppressed by States, not by the feder? al government. If all the States would agree, such a plan could succeed, but Virginia had a woeful experience with separate .State action when she attempt? ed tc^retaiiate upon England before the formation o: th~ Union. Some States would only wait for others to drive trusts out of their territory, in order to invite them into theirs. Waem woolen clothing is pretty cheap now, and is necessary, net only for comfort, but for health. It is not unnatural for the manufacturers of such clothing to want the tariff on it raised, as that would increase their profits, but why Congressmen, who are elected by the votes of the people who have to buy that clothing, should want any such thing, unless to redeem a promise to the manufacturers for bene received, is hard to tell. Thk negro republican candidate for mayor of Richmond two years ago is now on trial for swindling one of his own race, and is in danger of the peni? tentiary. If he shall escape, he should apply for an office under Mr. McKinley, in whose service he was engaged dur? ing the late political campaign. His character i.-. certainly as good as that of the man of his race who has just ! b:en elected a member of the Govern i or's council of Massachusetts. Thk President in his message to Con? gress to-day takes the wise ground that unless the condition in Cuba shall be entirely changed, this government should let Spain paddle her own canoe.

The aocused will plead that a game cock is not an animal, PRESIDENTS .MESSAGE. Presiden: Cleveland sent his annual message to Congress to-day. The fol lowing is a synopsis: A political contest, involving momen? tous consequences, fraught with feverish . apprehension and creating aggressive? ness so intense as to approach bitter ( ness and passion, has been waged ; throughout our land and determined ' by the decree of free and independent suffrage without disturbance of our tranquility er the leas: sign of weakness 't in our national structure. We discover ! abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide I by every verdict of the popular will. Our people exhibit a patriotic dispe? rsion wbich entities them to demand j of those who undertake to make and ! execute their law= such faithful and unselfish service in th .: behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appre? ciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of pubiic duty invites. We have made cuims agains: the Turkish government for the piilaceand destruction of missionary property at Harpon and Marash during uprisings at those places. Thus far the validity of these demands has no: been admit ted. though our minister, prior to such outrages and in anticipation of danger, demanded protection for the per=on= and property of our missionary citizens. Tne facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement. The insurrection in Cuba still con? tinues with all its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made towards the pacification of the island. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the considerable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two thirds of the inland country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strength? en with the lapse of time, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers, and character, and resources. Lf Spain has not yet reestablished her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent State. Indeed, as the contest has gone on, the pretense that ' civil government exists on the island, except so far a> Spain is able to main? tain it, has been practically abandoned. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open, or in pitched batilw, prompt and decisive re? sults might be looked for. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns ?i general engagements, that can choose and does choose its own ground, and that fights only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on its side. Excesses [ on both sides become more frequent and more deplorable. They are also participated in by bands of marauders, who, now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other, as may best suit the occasion, harry the coun '?? try at will and plunder its wretched in ; habitants for their own advantage. Be : sides its large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself inextricably involved in the present contest in other ways both : vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press, by public meetings, by the pur? chase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and by other means, which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal prosecu? tions. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers as nat? uralized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to posible protection by this government. The result is that this government i3 constantly called upon to protect American citizens, to claim damages for injuries to persona and property, now estimated at many millions of dol? lars, and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts of Spanish of? ficials. These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the large American property in? terests affected, and considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general, have led to a vehement demand in va? rious quarters for some sort of po.-itive intervention on the part of the United Slates. It was at first proposed that belligerent rights should be accorded to the insurgents. It has since been and is now sometimes contended that the independence of the insurgents should be recognized. But imperfect and restricted as the Spanish govern? ment of the island may be, no other exists there. It is now also suggested that the United States should buy the island?a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is urged finally, that, all other methods failing, the existing internecine strife in Cuba Bhould be terminated by our inter? vention, even at the cost of a war be? tween the United States and Spain?a war which its advocates confidently prophesy could be neither large in its protions nor doubtful in its issue. The United States has nevertheless a char? acter to maintain as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct. This government ha.s hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife, with honor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all the reason? able objects of the insurrection. It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy?a measure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements of her Span? ish subjects?there should be no just reason why the pacification of the isl? and might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the island. It would keep intact the possessions of Spain without . touching her honor. It would put the i prosperity of the island and the for- i tunes of its inhabitants within their own control, without severing the natural ] and ancient ties which bind them to ; the mother country. Being sincerely , desirous in the interest of both as well , as on its own account that the Cuban i problem should be solved with the least ' possible delay, it was intimated by this ' government to the government of Spain some months ago that, if a satis- , factory measure of home rule were ten- , dered the Cuban insurgents, and would ( be accepted by them upon a guaranty t of its execution, the United States < would endeavor to find a way not ob- ? jectionable to furnishing such guaranty, j While no definite response to this inti- t mation has yet been received from the ? Spanish government, it is believed to be r not altogether unwelcome, while, aa t already suggested, no reason is per? ceived why ic snouid not be approved by the insurgents. Ic is therefore fer? vently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between Spain and the insurgent Cubans, upon tho lines above indicated, may beat once inaugurated and pushed to an im? mediate and successful issue. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interests would con? strain us to object to the acquisition o: the island or an interference with in control by any other power. It should oe added that while we are anxious to accord all due respect to the sovereignty of SDain, we cannot view the pending conrlict in all its features, and proper? ly apprehend our ioevitaoly close rela? tions to it, and its possible results, with? out considering that by the course ol events we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition, as will fix a limit to our patient waitina tor Spain to end the contest. When the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection has : oecome manifest and when a hopeless struggle has degenerated into a strife i which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life, a situa tion will be presented in which cur ob' lig&tions to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obliga? tions, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge, deferring the choice of ways and methods until the time for action arrives. Until wt face the contingencies suggested, or the situation is by other incidents impera? tively changed, we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pursued, j The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference i between Great Bratain and the United States, their respective government having agreed upon the substantial pro visions of a treaty between Greai Britain and Venezuela submitting the whole controversy to arbitration. The i provisions of the treaty are so eminent' ly just and fair that the assent of Vene zuela thereto may confidently be an' ticipated. Negotiations for a treaty of genera! arbitration for all diligences between Great Britain and the United States are far advanced and promise to reach s successful consummation at an earh da e. The scheme of examining applicants for certain consular positions to test their competency and fitness, adopted under an executive order issued oo the 20th of September. 1895, has fully demonstrated the usefulness of this In? novation. In connection with this plan of examination promotions and trans? fers of deserving incumbents have been quite extensively made with excellent results. I desire to repeat the recommenda? tion contained in my last annual mes? sage in favor of providing at public ex? pense official residences for our ambas? sadors and ministers at foreign capitals, Following the discussion of foreign allairs the President reviews the reports of the various Cabinet officers and the workings of the departments of which they are the head?. Regarding the revenue the Presi? dent says: I believe our pre? sent tariff law, if allowed a fair oppor? tunity, will in the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably eco? nomical expenditures, will overcome all deficiencies. In the meantime no deficit that has occured or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any such deficit we have in the Treasury, in addition to a gold reserve of one hun? dred millions, a surplus of more than one hundred and twenty-eight millions of dollars applicable to the payment of the expenses of the government, and which must, unless ex? pended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if mot extravagantly wasted, must in any event be perverted from the purpose of its exaction from our people. The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in the revenue from this fund is nothing more than its prop? er and legitimate use. It is not one of the functions of qmt government to accumulate and make additions to a fund no: needed for immediate expenditure. It is immeasurably better to appropriate our surplus to the psy ment of justifiable expenses than to a'ic-w i: to become an invitation to reckless appro? priations and extravagant expenditures. Because we may be enjoys? a tem.r-.riry relief from the depressing iadaeace of mone? tary distress, we should not be lulled into a false security nor lead to forge: the Sudden? ness of past visitations. I am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured rir.?z cial peace and safety until the government currency obligations upon which gold may be demanded from the Treasury are withdrawn from circulation and canceled. This m.gh: be done, as has been heretofore recommenced, by their exchange for long-term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or by their redemption with tiie proceeds of such bonds. Even if only the United States notes known as green? backs were tens retired, it is probable that tho Treasury notes issued in payment of .silver purchases under the act of July 14. 1-!j<), now paid in gold when demanded, would not create much disturbance, as they might, from time to time, when received in the Treasury by redemption in gold or otherwise, be gradually and prudently re? placed by silver coin. This plaa of issuing bonds for the purpose of redompiioa certainly appears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform. In default of this, however, it would be a step in tho right direction if curr-ncy oMiga tions redeemable in gold, whenever so redeemed, should be canceled iu?tead of >>eing reissued This operation would bs a slow remedy, but ic would improve present condi? tions. National banks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to isaue circulation to the par value of bonds deposit? ed as security for its redemption, and tho tax on their circulation should be reduced to one fourth of 1 Der cent. In considering pro? jects for the retirement of United .States notes rind Treasury notes issued under tho Jaw of 1890, I am of the opinion that we have p ac ed too much stress 'upon the danger of con? tracting the currency, and have calculated too little upon the gold trat would be added to our circulation if invited to us by better and ssfer financial methods. It is not so much a contraction of our currency that should 1)0 avoided as its unequal distribution. This might be obviate!, and any :ear of harmful contraction at the same time remov? ed, by allowing the organization of smaller banks and in less populous communities than are now permitted, and also authorizing ex? isting banks to o-.tablish branches in small communities ender proper restrictions. The entire case may be presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial methods will not dawn upon us until uur government abandons the banking busi? ness and tho accumulation of funds, and con? fines its monetery operations to the receipt of the money contributed by the people for its iupport, and to the expenditure of such mon ?y for the people'3 benefit. Another topic in wh ch our people rightfully tike a deep interest may be h?re briefly con? iidercd. I refer to the existence of trusts and nber huge aggregations of capital, the object ?f which is to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, industry or com? merce, and to stifle wholesome competition, rheir tendency is to crush out individual independence. Through them the farmer, .ho artisan and the small trader is in danger )f di?lodgment from the proud position of )oing his own master and relegated to the level )f a mere appurtenance to a great ma ihine, with little free will, with no duty but ;hat of passive obedience, and with little hope >r opportunity of rising in the scale of respon* lible and helpful c tizenship. To the njtinctive belief that such is the inevitable, rend of trusts and monopolies is due he widespread and deep seated popular .version in which they are held and tho tot unreasonable insistence that, what ivor may be their incidental economic . advantages then: general ifr.t upon person. character, prospects and naefcirwfi cannot I ? otherwise ____ injanoas.
