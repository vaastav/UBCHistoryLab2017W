Be— fear \.mige ha* Introduced a com preliensive hill, the passajro of which will save »ny confusion hereafter respecting the matters already passed upon and anticipate any pos sible (jiiostioii which iii.-iy yet be raised concern inp the locality of the iu,;»osts by th<> Philippine government. The Philippine tariff on American and foreign goods is not discredited by the Supreme Court decision. It if? a law- passed by the Philippine Commission, the local government of the islands, under authority of the President, upon whom Congress conferred all "powers necessary to govern Ihe said island?." Objection may be made that the imposition of a revenue system upon the Islands is an exercise of legislative power which Congress could not delegate to the President. Mr. Edward B. Whitney, who was Af>«>j«tant Attorney Ueneral under President Cleveland, however, nearly a year ago expressed the opinion that the old maxim that legislative power cannot bo delegated had been nearly overthrown by the courts, which regularly sus tained what were in fact such delegations with regard to embargo, reciprocity, internal tax rebates and other things. Morsaaver. Congress has long been accustomed to delegate to Terri torial governments the largest lo^al legislative authority. Even it" delegation is forbidden con cerning affairs belonging exclusively to the national government, it is not forbidden with respect to the concerns of a particular Territory. The Philippine Commission's tariff is purely a local act. The commission might have levied a tax on houses or rice fields for local expenses instead of on imports. It does not exercise the power of Congress as the instrument for raising national revenue. It merely uses its local or municipal authority to levy what is really an octroi tax. This tax is quite different from the levies made by military authority on American goods in Porto Rico after the ratification of the treaty of cession and before tbe passage of the Foraker act. Such goods were entitled to free entry Into Porto Rico "ttntii Congress otherwise constitutionally directed." There was no law under which the military government acted. There is a law under which The Philippine Com mission arts, anfl iis h>vy can only be attacked on the ground that the particular power used could not be delegated. Th3t possible point is met by Senator Lodge's bill Tovldirijr thai the tariff passed by the Philippine Commission shall have full force and effect as a law of Congress. Thus its schedules would become a part of national law. and if not already in valid force would become 80. since *—— - the Supreme Court upholds similar imposts col lected in PsrtO Bleo under the I-Y.raker act. Senator Lodge also provides tor levying the same duties <v, goods from the Philippines as are now hupoged by the Dtagley law on goods from foreign countries. He avoids future com plications ?>y providing that general laws of the inited States shall not apply to the Philippines except as they may be enacted by the Philippine Commission. He likewise sets apart duties col lected in the Philippines under this taw for local | purpose*, just as they have been set apart When j collected by the Philippine Commission. There can be no doubt that this measure should be promptly passed. Perhaps an attempt \ will be ma lit to fan the old agitation Into a i blaze, but the people are now satisfied that it I was wise to bold the Mauds apart and not eora | plicate their problems with our own. Laws i made for us do not fit them, and laws needed for them would be ridiculous here. There should be no disposition to shut the Filipinos out from reasonable access to our markets. Almost all their products have been free, and the IMngley rates would now be imposed not really against them, but against foreign nations using them as a way station for shipping goods to the Catted States. The chief exception Is in the case of sugar. If we are to lower duties on Cuban sugar we should consider making a con cession to Philippine sugar. Whether this should be done by exception now. when applying the r.-st of the IMngley rates to imports from the Philippine*, or later in a separate measure, when reciprocity opens the door to other sugar. is a debatable question. The bill as a whole. however, is rertainly wise. Possibly some doubt of the right of the Sen ate to originate this bill may be raised. If so. it can easily be met by introducing it in the House and passing it first there. The Foraker act levying a tariff for Porto Bleo originated In the Senate, and that has been declared consti tutional. The House's prerogative with respect to "bills for raising revenue" apparently extends only to bills for national revenue. Mr. Lodge's bill, according to telegraphic reports, retains for the Halted States the duties to be collected here on Philippine commerce. If tlsat is tnie the claim of the House for precedence might be strengthened. This, however, is a mere matter of legislative procedure which should be settled between Republican leaders in what is surely the safe way without any trouble or delay. 

PROTECTING OEFICEHOLDERS. In line with the suggestions of President Roosevelt's Message several bills have been in troclii.-ed in Congress to bar out anarchists from this country and to punish more severely their attacks on order and government. Senator Burrows proposes a measare for tho exclusion and deportation of alien anarchists which au thorizes personal examination of suspected per sons for marks of membership in anarchist so cieties, and allows a fudge who is satisfied that an alien convicted of crime in a Inited States mart is an anarchist to sentence him to de portation in addition to other penalties. Just how the principles of a man who does not ad vertise himself as an anarchist or wear an anarchist society brand are to be discovered does not appear. Senator Hoar is the father of n bill subject ing to the death penalty any person who shall "make an attempt on the life of the President "of the United States, or any officer thereof; or "who shall make an attempt on tho life of the "ruler or chief magistrate of any foreign coun -try." There is no doubt that the President and all persons in line of succession to the Presidency should be better protected than they are now. but nmkinjr a capital crime of attacks upon nny officer of the T'nited States seems rather extreme. Just wliy assault with Intent to kill upon smile villasre postmaster <>r other petty officer of the United States should be punished with death, when a similar crime .liraiiist his neishbor is not. requires swine ex planation. There are many men with <rovern isent commissions who engage in personal quarrels and have encounters frith personal enemies. The object of any new penalties of this sort should be to protect the government from attack in the persons <>f its otlicers. not to set officeholders apart in a sacred class as per sons whose lives are io be specially protected, even when they run DO special risk owing to their public service, and when the irovernmeiit's safety and stability are not at all dependent on them.

KCEB. Cuba's request for better commercial treat ment is no new Hung. In one form or another it is older than her revolt asainst Spain. Be tween the two. indeed, there existed the rela tionship of cause and effect. We may unhesi tatingly declare that Cuba's grievance against Spain was primarily a commercial one, and that it was because Spain refused to redress that grievance because, that is, Spain refused to give the island a commercial system under which its people could prosper —that Cuba tirst and repeatedly raised tbe standard of revolt. To establish this fact it is not necessary to do more than to refer to familiar and unchallenged history. Down to the eariy part of the last century Cuba was commercially isolated from all the world except Spain. It was not until July. I*l7. that the Spanish Government relinquished its monopoly of the culture and mansCsctare of toMcco in the island, and it was not until Feb ruary Wi ISIS, that the ports of Cuba were opened to foreign commerce. The latter step was admittedly taken because it was believed it would make it possible to squeeze out of Cuba a larger revenue for the Madrid treasury, and it was coupled with tariff laws made by Spain for Spain's sol" benefit. The result was an increase in Cuban industry and commerce, and at the same time an earnest request for fair treatment in tariff matters. Cuban Depu ties in the Cortes at Madrid declared plainly, eighty years aj. r o. that if the application of oppressive tariffs were persisted In Cuba would he lost to Spain. "We require," they said, "the "entire abrogation of prohibitory laws as re "g«wfa the trade of Cuba." To this admonition and this plea Spain turned a deaf ear. and the consequence was that Cubans presently began to plot revolution. The famous declaration of independence of October 10. IMB, which began the Ten Years' War. was made by a ".lunta of Laborers." and was iustiuct with demands for such conditions as would assure the prosperity of the island and give to the people enjoyment of "the fruits of their labor." Finally in ISO.", just before the outbreak of the last war. one of the most representative bodies of the island, the Association of Planters and Agriculturists, of Havana, pave formal expression to the general sentiment in these words: It would be impossible to explain, should the attempt be made, the signification of the present commercial laws as regards any economical or political plan or system, because •conomically they aim at the destruction of public wealth, and politically they are thr cause of .vli)i(j\ii*h •Me <li*tiihlcnt and confatn the germs of grave <lisx< 

MIOMSL Sikli were the irrievances of Cuba against Spa in. The T'nited States regarded them as valid, and sympathized with Cuba over them. In view of tfceae facts it does not seem pos sible it oui:lit not to be conceivable— that the Tinted States should repeat and continue the ipsounli blunder of oppressive commercial laws i-oncerninp Cuba, and thus nrouse apainsr itself the legitimate grievance which Cuba long had Rjrainst Spain Nor can it he replied flint this country is uot doing so or guing to do so. since SBWYOBK DAILY TRIBUNE. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 6. 1901. It will leave Cuba free to fix her own tariffs. The United States has <lem.inde<l. Usl Cuba has rraflted. v.bat amounts to little short of a suzerainty over the island in its foreign rela tlons It' would not for n moment tolerate the making by Cuba of a commorcinl treaty with any other country which would discriminate a-ainst our commerce. In such circumstances the Tnited States is exercising authority and it cannot escape responsibility. It must either E jye Cuba as good a market as she can pet elsewhere or let her go elsewhere. Otherwise the old commercial discontent of Cuba will con tinue, and will be directed against this country 8* i, was formerly against Spain. We cannot believe that any rational American is wih -.!■.«; for that to be the outcome of our war for the liberation of Cuba. A RUTHLESS PROJECT. In comments on the proposed scheme to in crease (he facilities for handling traffic at this end of the Brooklyn Bridge, to which, with some Important modifications, Chief Engineer Martin gives his earnest approval, little has been said about one of its objectionable consequences The proposition is that a four track elevated railroad shall be built through Centre-st. as part of a link connecting the old bridge with the new ones north of it. That is to say. it is proposed to injure seriously the appearance of the upper end of the City Hall Park; from which the public has been hoping that the pres ent misij-litly buildings would soon be cleared away; t<» destroy the artistic value of the Cen tre-st front of tne costly and beautiful Hall of Records now going up at the corner of Cl.am bers-st.. and to lill the new criminal courts with the roar of passing trains. These grave objec tions to the plan on which the bridge officials and the Brooklyn Rapid Transil Company have set their hearts have been referred to in The Tribune and elsewhere, but we have not ob served any allusion to them in the reports which the Board of Ratttnate and Apportionment may be invited to consider to-day. Nevertheless, they demand careful attention. If can be safely affirmed as a general propo sition that no new elevated roads should be con Btrncted in the lower part of the city, or near the central line of it, »t least. .Mr. Sage used to think that the Manhattan Company's viaducts bad ■ pleasing appearance, but he never found anybody to agree with him. They are (right fully Ugly, and in various ways they exact a heavy sacrifice in return for the undoubted ser vice they render. For the reasons just given, a four track line through Centre-st. would be peculiarly offensive, and there should be no thought of adopting such a scheme until conclu sive proof has been submitted that there is no other possibility of dealing satisfactorily with the problem now presented at the bridge en trance. That has not yet been done. In the first place, no effort lias been made to ascertain how much relief would follow If the train ser vice on the bridge were now made as good as It formerly was under the management of the city. Again, nobody can determine in advance how the distribution of traffic wili be affected by the new bridges and the rapid transit tunnel. We bolieve there ta some official rapport for the theory that the use of the old bridge will not be materially lessened, but perhaps the contrary opinion that a great deal of traffic wiil be di verted to the new channels is quite as valuable. It would peetn to be the p".rt of wisdom to post pone the execution of a plan to which many weighty objections inevitably attach until the natural consequences of changed conditions have become apparent. Nobody wliu is not an extremely careless reader of The Tribune can imacine thai we re gard the situation at this end of the Brooklyn Bridge as a trivial matter. Of course, it Is scandalous, wellnigli intolerable and a monu mental proof of official shortsightedness. Tin' city ought to have taken, at the proper time, land enough for a dignified and spacious ap proach to one of the linest river spans in exist ence, and the public may have to pay a heavy price hereafter for in Imperfect remedy. Bui we cannot believe that it is yet aecttaary to build another elevated railroad along a route where it would be extraordinarily disfiguring »nd injurious. THE WAR OVER WAR METHODS. Tlk- outburst of German wrath at the British Colonial Secretary for Ills alleged insult to the German army appears to have readied its height, and perhaps to be now abating. It has been received in England with considerable calmness, though a few pretty energetic re sponses have been made. Neither side shows the slighttst symptom of being convinced by the other. Ii Ii 1 1 it is quite possible tliat there will be perpetual disagreement over it. To the Impartial onlooker it seems quite possible that the whole storm has arisen over a misapprehen sion, or over some as yet undetermined ques tion of tact Let is* recall, then, the formal ground of offei Mr. Chamberlain said in his speech that the time had come, or was coming, when nmre severe measures might be necessary in South Africa, and be added: "If that time "comes we can find precedents l'->r anything "that we may do in the action of those nations "who now criticise our 'barbarity' and 'cruelty.' "but whose example in Poland, in the Caucasus, "in Algeria, In Touquttt, in Bosnia, in the "Franco-German War. wo have never even "approached." The alleged insult is in the lasi clause, in the declaration that the British in South Africa have not employed as severe measures as the Germans di* in France. So the questions arise. What did the Germans do? and filial have the British done? The answer to the former is a matter of official record. Mr. 11. W. Wilson in "The London Mail" quotes official orders of the German Emperor, of the German Governor of Lorraine and of general officers of the German army in 1871, showing that because of the burn ing of a railroad bridge at Fontenoy a line of 4<H».<M«t marks was levied upon the district and the village of Fontenoy was "completely burnt." and the latter fate was promised to every place where such an incident occurred. Public notice was given by the Governor of Lorraine that if by noon the next day live hundred workmen from certain shops were not at the station a number of the Workmen and the heads of the shops would be seized and at once shot An other official order announced that all persons not in uniform, but with weapons, and com mitting acts of hostility to the Germans, would be "irrevocably put to death." Still another official notice stated that the pastor of a parish church had been court inartialied and shot for distributing arms and instigating hostile acts. Quotations are also made from the history by Colonel yon Widdein (a German) telling of the shooting of French civilians taken with arms iv their hands, and of the burning of homesteads in retaliation for the destruction of railroads and telegraphs. French civilians were also car ried on railroad trains— on the locomotives— as hostages. And in such prosecution of the cam paign "death was often inflicted upon innocent persons." The answer to the other question remains to be given. What have the British done in South Africa? It may be that (hey have acted more harshly than the Cennans in Lorraine. If so, Mr. Chamberlain did (Jermaiiy an injustice. But convincing evidence to that effect has not yet been produced. So far as the world has been credibly informed, the measures employed by the British have been no more severe, but rather less severe, than those attributed hy indubi table German authorities to the Herman nrmy, and we mipht add. than those employed in our own Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley and m the march from Chattanooga to Savanuah. The one novel feature of the South African situation Is found in the concentration camps. Concern iuc them, testimony Is so contradictory-some Boers declaring them humane, merciful and generous, and some Britons denouncing them as harbarous-that judgment upon them must for the present be suspended. As for the rest, the onus seems to be upon the German complainants to prove their case by convicting the British of harsher practices than those In the war of S But' since the "Cologne Gazette" rebukes a member of the Reichstag for saying that Mr. Chamberlain had accused the German army of Shooting French wonien-which. of course. Mr. Chamberlain did not do-and also refutes a Dutch story that the British are shooting Boer women, it seems quite probable that misappre hensions and unfounded sensations are respon sible for the major part of the trouble. It is not always what A said that gives offence, but what B 'said that C said that D said A said. \t any rate, the world is not yet prepared to believe that either the German or the British army has been guilty of wanton barbarities. the "pet rich quick" business sometim-s turns out to 1?e a "get locked up" affair. The Herman Government is undoubtedly mak ing a strong fight for its tariff bill, and is mak ing strong arguments In Its favor. It is Impos sible to criticise it for aiming to benefit German interests. The only question is whether the bill as drawn will do so. The profit account of college football this year has been so large and the figures of net earnings have been so dazzling that Wall Street promoters may soon be casting eager eyes of 1< nging toward the possible treasures of rev enue in the contest of the students, and may be talking about the capitalization of a Football Securities Company, with first and second mort gage bonds, debentures and scrip, first preferred and second preferred stock, and A. B, C and D In common. Hut they will be disappointed. Amateur sport and curbstone speculation are wide apart. Over how steep a toboggan slide to un fathomable depth* is Tammany now hurrying and scurrying? Mr. Crokor i« reported as saying that political leaders, like poets, are born, not made. But one thing Is certain. No political leader, wheth er born or made, will at any time in the future achieve a lasting success in governing so great a city as New-York from a little country village in England, three thousand miles away, whether the name of that village be Wantage or some other Tammany will not hang up Its stocking this Christmas. No chance of filling it. (>ur Fire Department ia doing a great deal '>f excellent w.ik.
