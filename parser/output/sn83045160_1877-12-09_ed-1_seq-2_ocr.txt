It waft prophesied a while Ago, when it was in timated that congress would take from cred itors the unfair advantages the present law pe them, that those who "meant to fail would do so before the chance. It almost looks as if the prediction had fact to support it. This is not the only influence, however, for every now and then the telegraph tells us of some calamitous failure among our steady going friend in Canada. Chicago has ha t a fill of bankruptcy horrors. As one good effect of them, it is said the hog-market gamblers who for some seasons have made the pork market there a sort of faro game find them selves enable to carry on their usual tricks and hap-hazard dives into futurity. If bo, it is a case of good springing out of eil. In the failure of national banks in that city, and elsewhere, we have bad an illustration of the advantages of our banking system in one respect, for creditors are secure from serious loss if they have to suffer any loan at all by the deposits tbe law rtqoirt from the national banks. To these are added the liabilities of the stock holders. When a national bank opens it must deposit, in the national treasury, United States bonds to an amount ten per cent, greater than its circulation. In case of failure the bonds are sold, and the proceeds go to the back's noteholders, so that its notes are as good after failure as before. The ultimate loss does not fall spon the depositors, but on the stock holders, as they are bound to protect the for mer to the extent of double the bank's cani if thn auu(ji of the bank itself are ijsoflkient. These are valuable features, and ua any future changes they ought never to be allowed to disappear. BORTOS ASD JOIIXSOX. Th liter which we publish in another column from Oliver P. Morton to An drew Johnson will occasion much surprise. Had Mr. Morton pursued the policy fore shadowed by his letter to the President, ho might htve lot his power as a party leader appealing to the passions born in war, but he would have been recognized by posterity as a patriot who could rise above the fanaticism of the hour. Nothing but the integrity of An drew Johnson saved Morton from an expos ure that would have sunk (him in the estima tion of his party. The fear of the revelation of this letter must have been like carrying a coal of lire in the bosom of Morton for twelve years. The letter which Morton addressed to President Johnson will be an important con tribution to the political literature of the day. In discusiing it, the St. Louis Globe-Demo-rai says: "In its review of the life and char acter of te late Senator Morton, the Globe Democrat asserted very positively that the deceased was a warm supporter of Andy Johnnon in the early days of the policy which led to impeachment. This state ment has since been very widely contra dicted, but to-day we print a letter recently discovered among Mr. John son's papers, which settles the matter very clearly on the side of the Globe-Democrat. This letter, it will be seen, was written after Mr. Johnson had sent to congress the annual message which occasioned the breach between him and the Republican party. It will not d, therefore, to say that Morton's . support of Johnson was solely prior to the announcement of the bitter's reconstruction policy. In fact, it was in full view of that policy. In the article to which we refer, the Globe-Democrat stated that in 1368 Senator Morton; knowing the extent to which he had committed himself to the Johnson policy, and at the same timi determined not to vote against his party on the impeachment ques tion, sought to persuade Johnson, through friends, to resign, so as to avoid the possible consequences of conviction. What Senator Morton feared .was the production in the court of impeachment of the very letter which is printed in our columns to day. Johnson showed it to some of his friends about the time of the trial, but he would not consent, even at the solicitation of his coun sel, to allow it to be produced in court. He had arranged, however, to have it, and sev eral otliers like it, from men who urged him to his policy in ISCo, and wanted to impeach him for his policy in 1S68, printed in the event of his conviction. We mention these facts to show that the author of the Globe Democrat's article on Senator Morton knew precisely whereof he spoke when he made the assertions to which exceptions have been taken. lie knew, among other things, of the existence of the letter which is now given to tbe public."

HOIT1I IX (OXUREM8. Prior to the war all the conservatism of the country was found in the south. While fa naticism was sweeping the north, the south was tranquil and serene. Millerism found no advocates in the southern States. While the fanatics of the north were dressed in as cension robes and had trap-doors made through the roofs of their houses, in order to give them an unobstructed egress when they heard the blar of Gabriel's bugle, the southern people dended all such tomfoolery and at tributed it to the distempered imagination of superstitious r.ealots. Millerism flickered out, but upon its ignoble grave sprouted free loveism; but this vile heresy never found a home in the south. The bigotry of know notbingism originated in the fanatical north, the birthplace of every vagary and humbug, and it swept many of the northern States in its proscriplive war. It marched into the southern States with all tbe pomposity of a conquering hero. After taking a good look at Sam, our people pronounced him an impos tor who would destroy civil and reb'gious lib erty, and at the first election they ad ministered to him a dose of Democ racy, which was like a doso of strychnine to a dog, and, after turning around, Sam died, and his soul, like that of John Brown, is still inarching on. There were no advocates of the Hartford convention in the south. The . blue laws, which made it a crime for a man to kiss his wife on Sunday, and which re- ' "tared the hobbling of the chickens to keep Vem from courting on the Sabbath day, 'nd no advocates in the conservative south. . Are not, therefore, surprised that the of the north are continually express astonishment and admiration of the . ir,,Preitat:ves in congress, lneso . : o tives may once have been fanatical . , , T l of State rightp,"and sensitive raent upon a species of prop v ? inherited from the north era States by purchase, theythouht it un just to denounce. But in ever thing tLat concerns the philosophy of government, m perstition or fanaticUui, the Houth has always laughed into scorn the various ims wh i h have suddenly upruDg up in the north and as rapidly rotted down. Only a few days ago a New York Republican paper showed that the southern members of congress saved the country from civil war growing out of the troubles connected with the inauguration of a President, and that thsir whole course had been directed by wise and prudent counsel. With such a confession what are we to think of the course of the Radical press, and tiie government toward the south ' These per secuted people persecuted on the ground that they were bloody savagos, who never stir abroad except with navy revolvers and bowie-knives, eager to cut the throats and take the scalps of loyal people, without re gard to race, color or previous condition, (ire now represented as the counselors of moder ation, tbe friends of peace and the support ers and vindicators of the laws. It is extra ordinary, indeed, that the section which Rad icalism is eternally and ferociously legislating against as secretly false and treasonable, and upon the truth of which malevolent assump tion it bases largely its claim for considera tion, is now, according to the admission of its own organs, the foremost and most reli able upholder of the law and the public peace in the whole country. At a crisis when, according to Republican admission, the south might, by a general upris ing and co-operation with "disloyal" Demo crats, and plunge the nation into a civil war, in the genuine acceptation of that term, and bring the horrors of battle, as she has herself felt it, to every city and hamlet in the north, she emphatically disclaims all appeals to arms and revolution, and leave entirely to her enemies bloodshed, Strife and turbulence. In view of this generally conceded fact, what will be the judgment of the people of this country upon the persistent declarations of inimical partisan leaders, ever since the war ended, that tbe south was not to be trusted, and ot its treatment by the Federal government as a conquered province ever since? What pre text has there been for sending troops south to watch the ballot-box for support ing carpetbag officials in their oppressions and extortions, their petty tyranny, demoniac malice and general bulldozing of the south ern people? The men who have thus ma ligned and maltreated the south are now writing "slanderers, robbers and tyrants" upon their own foreheads. Now they assure us that a section composed of swashbucklers, and always spoiling for a fight, are the reli able peacemakers at the most critical juncture for the internal peace of the country which has ever occurred, with a single exception, since the formation of the Union. TUB Hl'NU.tV PRESS. A few years since, a preacher, m ordain ing a young minister, said: ' Young man. you will often be at a loss for a subject. When you are hard pushed for a theme, and everything else fails, fall back on the pope of Rome; abuse him, and you will always give satisfaction." There are many preachers who imitate the example of this sectarian, not by advising abuse of the pope of Rome, but by abusing the Sunday press, when they are at a loss for a theme to discuss. The Chicago Times contains a sermon delivered on Sunday last, which, for scurrilous defama tion of the Sunday press, would be creditable to a bully at a military muste". This periodi cal traduction of the newspapers published on Sunday has become stale and threadbare, and many of those who abuse them would be more profitably employed, and better sub serve the cause of morality, if they would read from the papers they denounce instead of retailing their abuse of the press. Prob bably since newspaper men first print ted certainly as far back as the memory of the present generation goes newspapers have formed a part of the reading on the Sabbath in Europe and in our own country. Long before there were any Sunday papers the weekly issues were sought and perused on the Sabbath. This led to the issue of Sun day papers. These are not necessarily dated on the Sabbath. They are probably never printed on that day. The object is to gather, by telegraph and otherwise, the world's record of events that transpired on Saturday, and put it to press on Saturday ni.qht, so that the papers may be ready to meet the demands of the reading public on Sabbath morning. The effects of the Sunday press upon the morals and religion of the community is the best gauge by which correct decisions can be formed in reference to the propriety of a public indorsement of this class of publica tions. As long as the people generally create a demand for Sunday papers there will be a supply equal to that demand. At tho same time, it may be stated without contra diction that no publisher of any preten sions to christian or moral character would embark in such an enterprise if he believed the effects of a high-toned Sunday newspaper to be determined to be detrimental to the spiritual or temporal interests of society. We do not believe that the entire Sabbath day, or even any considerable portion of it, should be devoted to the perusal of the Sun day newspaper, however high-toned and at tractive the sheet may be. It is a day of rest mental as well as physical relaxation a day to be devoted to the contemplation of the attributes of the great author of the Sab bath, and of that revelation He has given to ua of Himself and His system and the objects of creation. But may we not open our Sun day morning paper and leisurely read the world's news, and draw important practical instruction- from the story.'whether it be of fires, floods or hurricanes, of promising crops, industrial progress, or happy homes; of revivals in London and elsewhere, or the results of. a servile yielding to tempta tion? May not the good minister, who goes before his congregation of sincere worshipers as the messenger of salva tion to all men, draw from his morning paper practical lessons which he can turn to good account in his pulpit efforts to assist in making his hearers better men and women ? But the Sunday paper must be prepared with care, and with especial reference to the ob jects and duties of the day. As long as the people habituate themselves to the perusal of a Sunday paper, the first aim of the publisher should be to furnish a sheet worthy of their attention, the tone of which will tend to ele vate the mind and bring mankind up to a higher civilization, by the cultivation of the nobler principles of humanity. The news paper is of comparatively modern origin. For many years after the invention of print ing from movable types, attention was main ly directed to the production of books and pamphlets. News was communicated only by oral report, and however important it might be, its transmission was stale and necessarily inaccurate. When, therefore, a transcript of current events was first made up and presented to the public in newfDaror form, it was received with favor, and its periodical issue became indispensable. That it has continue. I to exert a powerful influence in society and upon the progress of civilization, is a matter no one is prepared to dispute, At the same time the agency of the press hat, in all ages, since its introduction, been employed more or less for base purposes, and the newspapers have frequently been made the medium of scandal and misrepresentation, to the serious injury of individual character and the best interests of society, in our day this practice has experienced no abatement in its malignity; but it is confined more than ever before to a class of newspapers that have no claims to re spectability. In former times, when the newspaper was not held in ths estimation cf the public &a an indispensable necessity, some editors probably found it necessary to attack prominent individuals, or promulgate a scan' dal, in order to secure any considerable sals for their periodical issues. Not so now. The most acceptable commodity a newspaper can offer to its readers is facts in reference to the world's news, at home and abroad; and the higher the character of the paper for integri ty, the more is it sought for by all respectable readers. r - Kur tbe Sunday AppnaM TKJIITATIOX. J. When tbe aoul I aeak with sorrow, and tbe bod; worn r!lti care. When Bloomy, dark forebodings plunge the mind In black despair.

Respectfully, FELIX A. BEE YE. Nkw York, December 7, 1865. Hon Andrew Johnson, President United States: Dkati fim Sinr the publication of your message I have conversed with a number of the nrst men 01 new iorK in lue iuwutuu and commercial departments of business, and iound all to heartily approve it. I can not be mistaken in the opinion that the great body of the people in the north will indorse your doctrines and policy, and this the mem bers of congress will find out before they are ninety days older. The firmness with which you may stand to them will make you friends and conquer opposition. It is as I expected, and I believe told you, congress would begin with a majority against your policy; but there should be nothing disheart ening in this, for it will surely melt away or break to pieces in a short time. Were I in your place I would not fail to employ every power and instrumentality in my hands to sustain my policy and the friends who sustain it. While it is understood that mem bers of congress can oppose you, and in breaking down your policy break down your administration, and yet control your patron age, you may expect to have opposition and to fail. The resolute wielding of your pat ronage in favor ot your friends, inside the Union party, cannot fail to build you up with the people and disarm the opposition in con gress. Believing you to be right and guided solely by the desire to rebuild permanently our broken and disordered country, and, be sides, feeling great interest in your personal success, I trust you will excuse the freedom of these suggestions. The joint resolution which has passed the house, to which is to be referred the question of the admission of southern members, is cunningly devised, and is intended to entrap your friends in such a manner they cannot escape. How can either house make the question of admitting mpmnAro rlpnpnd linnn the action Of the other? "Each house shall be the judge of the quabfications ot its members, says tne constitution, and the power can neither be abdicated nor delesrated to the other. I am sorry to say my health is no better. My ar rangements are made to sail next week, on Wednesday. With earnest wishes for your health and success, I remain your friend, O. P. MORTON. The Occupant of "Iiower Xo. 3." Burlington Hawkeye: It was in the Cedar Rapids sleeper. Outside it was as dark as the inside of an ink-bottle. In the sleeping car the people slept. Or tried to. Some of them slept, like christian men and women, peacefully and sweetly and quietly. Others slept hke demons, malignantly, hideously, fiendishly, as though it was their mission to keep everybody else awake. Of these the man in lower number three was the "boss." When it came to a square snore with variations you wanted to count "lower three" in with a full hand and a pocket full of rocks. We never heard anything snore like him. It was the most systematic snoring that was ever done, even on one of those tournaments of snoring, a sleeping-car. He didn't begin as soon as the lamps were turned down and every body was in bed. Oh! no. There was more cold-blooded diabolism in bis system than that. He waited until everybody had had a little taste of sleep, just to see how good and pleasant it was, and then he broke in on their slumbers like a winged, breathing demon, and they never knew what peace was again that night. He started with a terrific 'ftn-r-r-r-t!" That opened every eye in the car. We all hoped it was an accident, however, and trust ies that he wouldn't do it again, we forgave him. Then he blasted our hopes and curdled the sweet serenity of our forgiveness by a long-drawn "li-a-h-h-h-hah!" That sounded too much like business to be accidental. Then every ,head in that sleepless sleeper was held oil the pulow lor a minute, waiting, in breathless suspense, to hear the worst, and the sleeper in "lower three" went on, in long-drawn, regular cadences that indicated good staying qualities. "Gwa-a-ah! Gwa-a-a-h! Oahwahwah! Gahwahwah! Gahwa-a-a-ah!" Evidently it was going to last all night, and the weary heads dropped back on the sleepless pillows, and the swearing began. It mumbled along in low, muttering tones, like the distant echoes of a profane thunder storm. Pretty soon "lower three" gave us a little variation. He shot off a spiteiul "Gwook!" Which sounded as though his nose had eot mad at him and was going to strike. Then there .was a pause, and we began to hope he had either awakened from sleep or strangled to death, nobody cared very partic ularly which. But he disappointed everybody with a guttural "Gurooch!" Then be paused again for breath, and when he had accumulated enough for his purpose he resumed business with a stentorious "Kowpff!" That nearly shot the roof off the ear. Then he went on playing such fantastic tricks with his nose and breathing things that would make the immortal gods weep if they did but hear him. It seemed a matter incredible. It seemed an utter, preposterous impossibil ity that any human being could make the monstrous, hideous noises with its breathing machine that the fellow in "lower three" was making with his. He ran through all the ranges of tbe nasal gamut; he went up and down a very chromatic scale of snores; he ran through intricate and fearful variations, until it seemed that bis nose must be out of joint in a thousand places. All the night and all night through he told his story. "Gawoh! gurrah! gu-r-r-r! Kowpff! Gawawwahl gawah-hah! gwock! gwarrt! gwah-h-h-11 wnoof!" Just as the other passengers had consulted together how they might slay him, morning dawned, and "lower number three" awoke. Every body watched the curtain to see what manner of a man it was that had made that beautiful sleeping-car a pandemonium. Pros ently the was toilet completed, the curtains parted, and ' lower numoer tnree etooa re vealed. Great heavens! It was a fair voune girl, with golden hair. and timid, pleading eyes, like a hunted lawn s! A Btrmnse Story. Cincinnati Enquirer: A few days ago we reported a story, which first appeared in the Covin tdi Commonwealth, about a case that occured in that aty, 12 which a man imposed himseii upon a woman whose h:! band had left her lor some tune, as ber law! ill spue, he bearing so strong a resemblance to her absent husband and being so familiar with her family history that she firmly believed him to be what he represented himself to be. Since the publication of that article additional facts in the case have been discovered. The unfortunate lady in the case is Mrs. Ignatz Getz, and the is a sister of the wife of Coun cilman Supple, of Covington, and of Mrs. Bernard Benainger, also of that city. It ap pears that her husband, Getz, who was a brother of one of the three murderers hung in this city in 1"67. enlisted in the regular army, and, after several years' service in Texas, he wrote a letter to his wife, stating that he had received his discharge on account of disability, and that he was going to Chicago in search of employment. She did not hear from him again until about two years ago, and then she learned from a man who had been in the Ohio penitentiary that he knew a man in that institution named John Getz. She corresponded with this party, and learned that he was in reality her hus band. Shortly after a man made his appear ance in Covington, and claimed to be the long lost Getz. Though he closely resembled her husband, Mrs. Getz and her friends were in clined to doubt his identity, but after a while he showed such a thorough knowledge of her affairs and of her husband's previous history that she became convinced that he was really Getz, and she took him into her home. He lived with and supported her until last week, meanwhils bearing him a child, and then her real husband put in an appearance. The result was a scene that may be imagined but not described. Getz, it appears, had been sent to the penitentiary for some offense for six years, and while there formed the ac quaintance of a man who had but four years to serve. To this man he imparted the story of his life, and the false friend improved his knowledge upon his release from prison by imposing himself upon Mrs. Getz as her hus band. The im poster has left for parts un known, while the genuine husband has re sumed his marital relations, and has deter mined to wander fro v home no more. Nevada's Illssest Xnfget. Pioche Record: From John Yerzan, who, in company with T. C. Pouiade, arrived from Osceola on Saturday last, we learn the fol lowing concerning the greatest mass of gold yet discovered in Nevada. The golden mass, when first found, was thrown into a pile of waste earth, and there it lay undisturbed for several weeks. Finally, it was carried by a pack animal, along with the thief's camp fixings, into Ward, where it was melted into small bars. The pieces, before melting, weighed just twenty-four pounds and fifteen ounces avoirdupois, and, as it contained but very little quartz, its actual coin value must have been at least four thousand dollars. The finder of this truly wonderful specimen was a man who had been under many obli gations to Mr. Verzan, his employer and the principal owner in the mine. When Yerzan met the thief in Ward he greeted his late employe cordially, as a old friend, and offered him assistance, supposing him to be in need. This was too much. The thief, pale aad haggard, met Mr. Verzan the next morning. He said that he had passed restless days and sleepless nights long enough; that he was willing to give up all that remained of the stolen property for simple forgiveness, for one night's rest, for one meal unalloyed by .the thought that it was purchased with stolen goods. Then he told the story of the nug get, as given above, meanwhile dropping in to the hands of the astonished owner bar alter bar of heavy, solid, shining gold. The owners of tie claim realized two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. One bar, valued at about two hundred and fifty dollars, was giving to the repentant thief, who immediately there-after disappeared. Of the remaining fifteen hundred dollars a part was sold to Wells, Fargo & Co.'s agent at Ward, hav ing first been alloyed with copper to avoid suspicion. As nothing definite can now be proved, the thief's accomplices in the meltiug are still at large. For the Sunday Appeal. I)K OLB
