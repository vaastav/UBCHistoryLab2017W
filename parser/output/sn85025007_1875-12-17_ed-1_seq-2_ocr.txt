Several of the persons interested in the French spoliation claims have beeo in Washing ton since the meeting of Congress. The at tempt to get a bill through providing for the pay ment of the claims is to bo renewed. One prop osition, which is favored by those who repre sent the bulk of the claims, is to petition Con gress that the claims may be paid out of the balance of the Alabama award. Under the present law respecting the distribution of this award, more than half of it will not be needed, but if, as seems likely now, the insurance com panies and other claimants are allowed to be included, there would not be much of it left for Frenoh spoliation claimants. Messrs. J. T. Pickett and J. J. Stewart, on behalf ot the heirs of Jaoies H. Causten and other French spoliation claimants, have memorialized the Senate to request the President to endeavor, through our minister to France, to secure the return to this country of the evidence of losses iueurred by our oiiizens between 1792 and 1S01. which were forwarded'by our State Depart nient to France as the basis of a claim ot in euinity, and have never been returned, al though, by the treaty ot July, 1S01, our gov ernment accepting the French claim of set-off, assumed the obligations of that government to our citizens. It is supposed that these proofs ttill exi>t among the archives of the French government. Every day a large number of petitions are presented in the Senate in favor of a commis sion to inquire into the effects of the liquor traffic. It is the design to support Senator llowe's bill to provide for a commission on the subject of the alcoholic liquor traffic, which re quires the President to appoint (subject to con firmation by the Senate) a commission of five persons, neither of whom shall be a Federal officeholder nor an advocate of prohibitory leg islation or of total ab!>t;nence in relation to al coholic liquors, who shall serve without 9-ilary and within two years investigate the liquor traffic, ils relations to revenue and taxation uud its general economic, criminal, moral and scientific aspects in connection wilh pauperism, erime, social vice, the public health and gene ral welfare of the people, and also inquire and take testimony as to the practical results of liccose and prohibitory legislation for the pre vention of intemperanoe in the several States of the Union. The bill appropriates $10,000 for neoessary expenses, and requires the com mission to report the result of their investiga tion to the President to be by him transmitted to Congress. Cannot all these matters be left Jo the States? Even those who consider a pro hibitory law desirable, must know that Con gress has no power to pass such a law. The Republican party leaders are trying to hedge against the foolishly stupid blunder the President made ia his annual Message, when he urged Congress to submit to the Legisla tures of the States a Constitutional amendment making it the duty of the States "to establish and maintain public schools adequate to the education of all children in the rudimentary branches within their respective limits, irre-1 spective of sex, color, birth plaoe or religion; forbidding the teaching in said schools of relig ious, atheistic or pagan tenets. A prominent gentleman, after having read this part of the President's Message, said to a member of the Cabinet whom he accidentally met one day, "What does the President mean by recom mending such an amendment? Suppose a State refuses to establish or maintain schools or to prohibit the teaching of religion in them how will you enforce the Constitutional amend ment?" The Cabinet Minister smiled and said, "Well, I can't answer that. The Presi dent thought he had hit upon such a devilish good thiog that he didn't show it to his Cabi net, and the first I knew about it was when 1 read it in the newspapers." Colonel Forney writes from London that Hon. Reverdy Johnson, who is now sojourning in the Eoglish metropolis, is everywhere sought and welcomed by the leaders of the Eoglish bar. His strong, melodious voice, his reten tive memory, his fund of wit and humor give to his eloquence a peculiar charm, and it is difficult to believe, as you mark his erect and graceful fuure aud listen to his strong and mauly rhetoric, that he has passed so far be yond the Psalmist's age. Enjoying life to the uttermost, food of society, a capital conversa tional^, a courteous listener, his heart respon sive to the best feelings of our nature, he is the centre and charm of every circle. Few public men caD look back over a career at once so varied and so honorable. Judtje Wellford, ot the Richmond City Cir cuit Court, has appointed Gen. Wickham re ceiver ot the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company. If, on the 20th inst., the Circuit Court of the United States, which is to meet in this city on that day, decides that it has no jurisdiction, Gen. Wickham will at once euter upon the duties of receiver under the appoint ment. The Circuit Court ot Richmond will then proceed to ascertain the priorities of the liens on the road in order to foreclose the mort gage and settle with bondholders. The South Carolina Legislature, which is overwhelmingly Radical, yesterday elected as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the State a colored, man named Wright, and the circuit judges, all Republicans. The elec tion of Wbipper, Wiggin and Moses, the first for Charleston circuit, the most important in the State, oreates regret and indignation among the best class of Republicans and the people of lite State generally. It is not too much to say thatthe Democrat ic majority in the House of Representatives-ot the l^pited States, hold io their hands the de termination ot the 'Republic fur many years. Wisdom, discretion and stati'smenlike tact, this session, will insure a Democratic triumph during the Centennial year, and will euable the country to start upon the second century of its existence united and free, full of promise of blessings to our pot-terity, and still a beaoon of hope to the world. If, however, personal rivalry shall interfere with discreet movements, if the meao ambition which has selt for its object, be substituted tor that patriotism "that makes ambition virtue," history will write of all the Democratic leaders of to-day : They preferred their own ambition to the safety of tbeir country, and ruined at once themselves, and the people who trusted them. There has never been a Congressional invest igation for which there was so little warrant, as for that which is now proposed by Mr.Mor too, into the affairs of the State of Mississippi. There were some election riots, but nothiug that could,in any material degree, have ohaug-, ed the result of the election. The Democrats I have won Mississippi from Radical misrule,and therefore a pretext to interfere in the local affairs of the State is gotten up. Mr. Morton unwittingly disclosed the motive ot bis resolu tion. "If we let this alone," said Mr. Morton, "next year the same thing will be done in South Carolina and Louisiana." A valued correspondent writes as follows: "In your just strictures upon the system of absenteeism from their seats of members of the Legislature, to the great hindrance of business, you do uot touch the true sore spot. It is that petty bribe of free tickets over the railroads which causes the want ot quorums on Saturday aud Monday of almost every week. If you can shame the Legislature iuto passiog a law mak ing it a misdemeanor at least to give or take this bribe, yuu will do much to cure the evil." Now that the Uuited States Senator has been chosen, it is hoped the Legislature will go to work; let the code alone and adjourn as soon as possible. If the members want to make themselves popular, let them make haste to get away, and thereby relieve the burdens of the people by lessening their taxes to that amount. The Rockingham Register opposes taxation of churches, and says : "Until we find con gregations are making a speculation off their church memberships, and perverting their right of exemption from taxation, from relig ious to carnal purposes, we think there should be no attaok on or modification of our present laws." _______________ By the reassessment of lands in Clarke county the number of acres is ascertained to bo 107,526$, valued at $2,447,782.94.

WASHINGTON LETTISH. [Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.] Washington D. Cm Dec. 16. -The feature of the day at the Capitol was the debate in the Senate, on Mr. Morton's Mississippi resolution, indulged in on the one side by Mr. Morton, of Indiana, and on the other, by Messrs. Bayard, of Delaware, and Thurman, of Ohio. The re solution provides for the appointment of a oommittee to investigate alleged frauds at the late election in Mississippi, by which a radical majority of twenty-five thousand was overqome by a like majority for the Democrats, which Mr. Morton thinks oould not have been done except through "fraud and intimidation." Of course, Mr. M. made a specious argument, and his usual partizao appeal, but was met by Mr. Bayard with a most overwhelming reply, parts of which were warmly applauded by the galle ries. When Mr. Morton told Mr. Bayard that the politios of Delaware might change, and he (B.) go under, Mr. Bayard quickly replied that, should such an event happen and he be displaoed, he hoped and prayed that no inves tigating committee would be appointed in his interest. The ultras are desperate, and it is Mr. Morton's idea to so legislate as to intimi date and bring under subjugation again the Southern States, so as to effeot the Presiden tial election, and secure the continuation of Radical rule. It may be safe to predict, indeed it is already spoken of, thatshould Morion's resolution pass the Senate, one of a like character will bo passed by the House, and a committee of Northern Democrats appointed to give to the country a aorrect version of affairs in Missis sippi. As at present constituted the game be tween the parties will be a pretty one, with odds in favor of the House. The House was not in session to day, and will only sit for a short time to-morrow, when it will adjourn for a trip to Philadelphia, at the invitation of the Centennial Committee, who will dioe and wine the?morabers liberally and then, of course, expect a little appropriation to celebrate the "nation's birthday," and pour in to the coppers of the city of Brotherly Love millions.

LETTER FllOftl RH IINONl). The 1Itesapeake and Ohio Railroad ? Facts About the Itoud-Meeting of tlie Stockholder-*?A Farmer Want" ?d *<l ouster nation Aiuou^ Lesisltt" tors, ete., etc*. [Correspondence of tho Alexandria Grzotte.] Richmond, Dec. 16. 1875. The adjourned meeting of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company was held to-day. Geo. Williams C. Wickham, the Vice Pres ideut, read the report of the President, C. P. Huntington, esq. The report attributes the small amount of through business to the waut of a connection by rail from its western terminus with the great centres of trade in the Wet, Southwest and Northwest; to the low rates for freight which have prevailed during the greater part of the year on competing lines,and to the finan cial embarrassments o! the company,which are well knowu, aud which have induced many large shippers of freight to seek other routes, of transportation who would otherwise havu entrusted this compauy with the transpoita tioQ of their property. The report says it was hoped and believed that the proposition for funding a portion ol the interest on the mortgage debt, and the whole of the floating debt into incoma bonds, would have been acceded to by nearly all, if* not all, of the bondholders and other creditors, but after the most patient and earneet efforts of the officers and financial agents of the com pany, it is found that a uumber of bondholders aud other creditors refuse their assent to the plan proposed, representing au amount suffi cient to annul the plan. Alter listcniug to and carefully considering all other plans proposed by those who would not accede to those pro posed by the company, the President and Board of Directors became oouvinced that none of them wore practicable. When, there fore, it became evident that tho company could not pay the interest that would mature on the first of November, instant, on its six per cent, mortgage bouds, the Board of Directors ap pointed a committee of seven of its members, whose duty it should be to devise a plan for the reorganization of the company, on a basis that should be just aud equitable to all inter ests. To this work the committee gave earnest and careful atteution, holding meetings almost every day, and they had nearly agroed upon the details of a plan for re-orgauizatioo which it was iuteuded should be submitted to all per sons interested for their aonsideratiou aud ap proval. This work of the committee was in j tcrruptcd in the early part of October by the action of the Circuit Court of the Uoited States for the Eastern District of Virgiuia, aud the District of West Virginia, in appoiuting Mr. Henry Tysou as t3mporary receiver of the property, incomes, franchises, etc., of the com pany. The report then goes iuto a long statement ef the facts of the seizure of the road and the appointment of Tyson as reoeiver, and in this conncction says: "Your property is now in his hands, and subject to bis management, lie is a strauger to your President aud Board of Directors, aud so far as they are advised he has no pecuoiary interest whatever in the property, nor have either of his sureties, all of whom are non-res idents of Virginia or West Virgiuia. It does not appear ju.st and right that a property of such magnitude and of so great cost should be taken out of the management and control of its rightful owners, and be placed in the hands of a stranger against the expressed wish of so large a majority of all persons interested in it, as bondholders, stockholders, and general cred itors, aud especially as nut a siugle person in terested in the property asked fur the appoint ment ol Mr. Tyson." The report, of General Wickham showed that the earuiugs of the company lor the past year ending September last were $1,459,189.48, and the expenses $1,112,320.70. There was a decrease of passenger fare amounting t) $43. 749.89, and an iucrease of freight of $43, 550.17. The report testified to the good order of the road. Oq motiou, the old Directors of the company were re-eleeted. General Skeen, of Alleghany, offered a res- j olution approving the action of the courts oi Virginia and West Virginia in appointing General Wickham receiver, aud expressing the hope that he would soon be put in lull posses sion and control of the road, franchises, <fcc. The resolution was adopted. The meeting then adjourned. Reoeiver Tyson happened to be out of the oity at the time. Great consternation was created in the House to-day by the announcement that. Mr. Seig, of Highland and Bath,was suffering Irom a case of genuine smallpox. It is supposed that the unfortunate gentleman contracted the disease in the couutry, as Richmond is almost eutirely free of it. He was stopping at a leading hotel here, and the intelligence, it. was at first fear ed, would cause the guests to leave, but upon being assured that there was no danger the majority of them remained. He was at ooce taken to the smallpox hospital. It cannot yet be ascertained whether he is iu danger. A large number of couoty treasurers are in the city paying io their taxes. They propose having a meeting and memorializing the L"g islature to alter the present law requiring them to make their returns by a sertain time. Whether they will accomplish anything by this remains to be seen. The Board of Visitors of the Blacksburg Agricultural and Mechauical College have been in session here for several days. One of the duties incumbent upon them is the appoint ment of a farmer for the college. There are almost as many parties lobbying for that place as there were aspirants for the position of pen itentiary store keeper. Twenty eight gentle men have signified iheir entire willingoess to educate the young mind how to plant pump kins and squashes. The applicants are all so polite and accommodating about this trifliug matter that the Visitors find it difficult to de cide who shall be the man. General Williams 0. Wiokham feels himself profoundly houored by being nominated for U. S. Senator by the Republican members of the General Assembly. He deserves a better but. Taken as a whole the colored element io the General Assembly is a deoided improvement on the old crowd there io previous years. Stkongbow. Who Put Out that Fire?

[Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.] Leesbuug, Va., Dec. 16, 1875.?Our Board of Supervisors has been culled by three of tbeir number to bold a special meeting oo Tuesday uext to consider importaut matters. What tbey are it is hard to surmise. Some think it is to consider the condition of the jail, which is half tilled by white aud colored crimioals, and the other halt tilled by one crazy white man. I hear further that au iosano daughter of the late Michael Beamer has beeu confined in an outhouse for months; that she is io a pitiably disgustiug condition, but that now, by the death of her father she is worth several thous and dollars. The Sheriff, who has beeo order ed to take charge ot her, has applied in vain to farmers to take care of her, otferiog to give any price that uuy three free holders may thiuk reasonable. There is no room iu the jail uuless she be put in the same room with the male lunatic, which is not t) be thought of. It may be that this matter moves the Supervisors to oome together. It may be that they come to gether to consider the condition ot tho poor's house and the farm attached thereto. I understand there are forty-nine paupers at the poor's house, and I believe there are eight cabins occupied by them, it may be there is a larger house for some ot them. The farm is situated io Mercer District about five miles trorn the Fauquier line, and perhaps seven from the Clarke line; it contains about 360 acres, and is worth from $30 to $35 per acre, or say $12 000, the county has, besides, $8,000 let out, making $20,000. It strikes me very foicibly that (his sum would make a fine sink ing luud tor bonds to the extent ot $30 000, to be appropriated to the purchase ot a tarm and the building of a poor's house, nearClarke's I Gap, where the roads from thr e districts con I verge, aud which is much more accessible to ! the other two lower districts, Locsburs and i Broad lluu, thau the present location, and not very much more iuconvenient to Mercer Dis trict. Here the nearness to the railroad would enable tho paupers to cultivate currents, rasp berries, strawbc tries, asparagus, and vegetables generally, and dispose of them readily, and after a while truits would come ou, which would make the institution self-supporting. Six per cent, interest aod one per ci-nt. additional as a sinking fuod would he $2 100, which would be a tax of about l? ceuts iu the $100 on property. Again, the Board may deem it advisable to petition the Legislature to cause the tithe of i 50 oeuts to be applied wholly, to schools, which would make the head tax $1.50, and should the amendment to the Constitution be adopted $2 50. This $2 50 per head ought to produce $500,000, or perhaps $550,000, it' rigidly col lected, and thus, to a cousiderable extent relieve property trom the school tax. Agaiu, the Board might petition the Legis lature to cause one-half the taxes ou property to be oollected by November 1, and the other half by May 1, tho bead tax being payable all by Nov. 1, as above, but to do so the Treasur er should be required to be at his office ail week days from the time he gets the books to the 1st of November. This might be supple mented by a penalty of 10 por cent, on tho halt' not paid wheu due, or oue per cent, for the first month, two per oent. for two mottle, and five percent, for three month's delinquency. This would avoid risk ineurred by a "peripatetic treasurer," who has sometimes thousands of dollars with him, and who offers, by his pub- , hc ty of that fact, great temptations to robbery. It would also do away with the risk now incur red by placing the money in National Banks, which may break and cause loss to the Com monwealth, and leave it io the hands of the people till it is needed. This rule might be applied to ail taxes, State, county and muni oipal. These suggestions are applicable to all larije counties. N. B. L understand 'hat Frederick county has a model Superintendent of the L'oor, aud that he very nearly supports the poor from the proceeds of his farm. There was no coun ty levy tor poor in 1874 for Frederick county. Would it not bewail for the Legislature to call tor his reports and make them a study?
