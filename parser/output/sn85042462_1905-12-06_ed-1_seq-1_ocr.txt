Ized Policy Holders to Demand President Burnham's Removal, Received $15,000 By A Modi) ted Press. NEW YORK, Dec. s.— lnstances in which the Mutual Iteserve Life In surance company paid an aggregate of about $20,000 In , what Vice President George D. Eldrodge of that company called "hold ups" were related to the life insurance Investigating committee by Mr, Eldrcdge toduy. In the case in IS9B, Mr. Kldredgc testified, the com pany piiltl $in,ooo to John McDonald, n Philadelphia lawyer, who had been active in organizing the policy holders of the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance company, Into a movement which charged President Frederick A. T?urn hfim of that company with mlsmanage ment nnd demanded his removal. The charges also reflected upon Mr. Kl drcflgc's management an vlco presi dent nnd threat was niaile to ask f<jr tho appointment of a receiver for thfi company. Kngagerl in this movement of ' the policy holders also was J. S. Hoffecker, a former auditor of the com pany, who hud been dismissed or who had resigned. . Ilefore leaving the com pany Hoffecker informed President Burnham that he resigned because their ideas as to common honesty differed so much and because he knew of so many questionable transactions of which President Burnham had ap proved. Mr. Eldredge declared that Hoffecker was not dismissed until he had demanded an increase In salary from $36 to $100 a week and practically paid It waa safer for the company to keep him than to let him go, In view of what he knew about the company. "Another instance of a hold up," Mr. Kldredgo said, "was In 1890, when Max Beehler. a so-called examiner of the lowa insurance department, came to New York with his son as an assistant, examinedthe Mutual Reserve Life In fiuranco company and presented to It a bill for $489 for the examination. Hather than pay the bill the company withdrew lta business from lowa, but a little later paid that bill and another of $346 to Max Beehler for a verifica tion of his previous examination in or der, to get permission again to do busi ness in lowa." Mr, Eldredge told how he tried to secure a license for his company to do business In Missouri in 1898 and found that It would have to employ W. H. Phelps as attorney before It could do so. Phelps got the license for the company In three days and was paid $3500 as "illegal fees," Mr. Eldredge said. Mr. Eldredge testified also that he •was certain there was no truth in the statement made to a Canadian Investi gation committee by James D. Wells, former vice president of the Mutual Reserve, that President Burnham of that company had told Wells he had to raise $40,000 to pay to the New York insurance department In 1899, when Louis F. Payne was superintendent of insurance. The witness had previously stated that a portion of a report made by Isaac Vanderpool, an examiner of the New York insurance department, after an examination In 1899, was eliminated after a hearing before the Insurance de partment and before it was placed on file. The part stricken out recom mended that the company be not al lowed to call its lease of Its home office an asset and Include it In its surplus. Mr. Eldredge declared that the Mutual Keserve company paid no money to the New York state insurance department in 1899 except for the examination.

WASHINGTON, Dec, 6.— The first sign of a split between the president and the leaders of his party In the senate on the railroad question became manifest today In a sudden but de termined opposition to the confirma tion of Franklin K. Lane as a member of the Interstate commerce commis sion. Lane's nomination wns sent to the senate today and was referred to the committee on Interstate commerce. Lane Is described as a Bryan kind of Democrat which in objectionable to the Republican senators. It Is claimed by the Republicans that Lane's nom ination by the president Is due to the: Influence of his personal friend, Ben jamin Ide Wheeler, president of the University of California, who isf also n Democrat. Senators Flint and Perkins suggested several prominent Pacific coast Re publicans but Roosevelt said he didn't care to make the appointment on par tisan grounds, and Lane was then de cided on. A prominent Republican Benator ex pressed himself thus: "The president's appointment of Lane looks like a bid for Democratic sup port In congress, nnd It would seem that Roosevelt is anxious to get credit lor jamming rate legislation through congress, being willing to make trades with Democrats to accomplish his purpose." If Lane's name Is not withdrawn the committee on interstate commerce is likely to postpone the report on his nomination indefinitely. 

ROOF OF A LONDON RAILROAD STATION FALLS SEVERAL PERSONS KILLED AND MANY SERIOUSLY HURT Collapse Occurs at the Charing Cross Depot and Forty Workmen Are ; Carried Down With the Ruins. Empty Cars Crushed By Associated Press. LONDON, Dec. s.— Ninety feet of the roof of the southernmost end of the Charing Cross railroad station col lapsed without warning this afternoon, carrying with it pome forty workmen, who were engaged In repairs on that section of the roof. The casualty list of this extraordinary accident Includes two persons who are known to have been killed, two persons missing 1 and probably burled beneath tons of de bris, eight seriously injured and twen ty slightly injured. The falling walls of the station crushed the roof of the Avenue theater, adjoining the station, Injuring several men who were at work there. Four trains stood In the station ready and hundreds of persons were gath ered on the platforms, awaiting the departure of suburban trains and the arrival of the Continental express, which was due in a few minutes, when the walls supporting the great iron spans fell outward. With this support removed, the spans fell with a tre mendous crash, crushing the foremost cars, which, happily, were not occupied, but the falling roof carried with it the workmen who had been swarming among the girders. All the casualties were confined to the workmen in the station and on the roof of the theater and to a few sta tion hands. Not a single passenger waa hurt. For some time the scene of confusion was Indescribable. Charing Cross is the most central, as well as one of the busiest of London's railroad stations, and had a larger portion of the roof given way the loss of life would have been great. As a result of the accident the station will have to be closed for some days. STEAMER SINKS; 11 DROWNED Disaster Takes Place Near Magdalene Islands, Off Cape Breton By Associated Press.
