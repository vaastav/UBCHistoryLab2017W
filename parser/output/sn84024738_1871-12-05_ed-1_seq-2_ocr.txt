The decision has ho delighted the Gold Board aud other gamblers that we feel a sort of sympathy with F. & G.

A lUSINANT OF PtAVERr^-It appCRTS to be rtill an open Question out In the Indian Teirilory whether the fourteenth amend ment applies as well to the red man o? to tho white. The Creek Iudians ill hold the negroes in bondage, although the amendment alluded to was supjioscd to have abolished slavery in ail the Mates and Territories of tbe United States. The Dis. trict Attorney ol tho Western District of j Arkansas is in n quandary, and has written 1 to Washington for instructions. Of oourso the Constitution is the supremo law of the land, hut the difficulty is rhat in our treaty with the Indians we have recognized tliem as distinct and separate nation-*, with the right to manage their domestic alfiirs in their own way. To get entirely rid of slavery it may become necessary, therefore, to aban don t'uo traditional policv of tbe Govern ment In treating with Indians. So says the isew \ork Post, but wo believe that the last session of Congress passed a law forbidding tho recognition by any troaty of Indians as distinct nationalities. A Horrible Affair in Arkansas?

Comment upon the message I is'gener?llv favorable, aiul it Is regarded as I ostremely judicious. Tho rccommenda I tlou in favor o( general amnesty certainly I gives it immense weight, a4* it is positive I uud thorough In its declaration?. The I opinion is expressed thut Congress will! adopt that portion of tho roes-u&e very I pooi'j, aud that proscription South will be I entirely obliterated. Us pacific touo eon- 1 cerning foreign illations senerally is eon- J Etderod as giving it an additional strength. I The Secretary of tho Treasury, in his an- 1 ntial report, adheres to li s formerly ex- 1 pressod opinion that the payment annually I upon the principal i:f this public debt should I not. be less than tilty millions. Ho ws: "As largo as the revenues of the country I have been during the last thrto years, our! system of taxation bus not been oppressive I to individuals, nor his It in any teusible de I ^ree tJinbarTassed the busiue-s ol the ooun* I try ; aud while relief from taxatiou is desi- 1 rable, it is yet more desirable to maintain 1 public credit in its present elevated posl- 1 tion, uot only as an example to otliei na- 1 Hons, hut for its historical value In eua-| blicg the Government to inako loans fori largo amounts upon favorable terms, if,l uuhappliy, iu the future, on exigenc\ I thould require such loans to ho made.' I in considering a reduction of taxes he keeps! \a view? first, that tho ability of the nation I to pay at least cOO, 000,000 annually of the! principal of tho public debt shall cot bo im-| paired; and secondly, that in a change oil the revenue system no vtok-nco rhall be I done to the busloose interests of the eouu-l try. He oousidors " it Is practicable to dis- 1 p'nse with all taxes from internal sources, I except that derived from stamps, spirits, tobacco, aud iudU liquors. These sources should turuisb for tio yoar 1S7'2-'7i> a reve nue of about $110,000,000. making a reduction of taxes of $10,000,000." Ho re commends tho reduction of the duties on salt to tho extent of 30 per cent. ; the duty on bituminous coal to 50 cents per ton; the* reduction of the duty on raw hides and bkins, and tho removal of all duties from a fergo class of articles produced la other countries w hieh cuter iuto the arts and icvnufaetui'QH ot this country, and which arc jut produced in tho United States, and i tho ?vevcuue trom which is inconsiderable. The .most serious obstacle In tho way of negotiating the 4 and AM per cent, bonds lu Europe & the inadequacy of the commis sions allowed. Tho Secretary advises such an allowance for commissions on the <1 and per cen5. bonds as will injure. tho nego tiation of thorn \\ ilb. the least possible I delay.
