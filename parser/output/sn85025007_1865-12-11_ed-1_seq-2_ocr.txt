A ?k* ?tJ*x#?d*i# teutiit , MONDAY EVENING^ DECEMBER 11. The National Intelligencer commenting on the Republican Cauous resolutions, introduced and passed ia theHouse of Representatives, and I deprecating and condemning such action, says:' "It is not the least singular feafcpean tbis Coc^ gressioaal proceeding, that the Souse has given to the action of the oaueus the form of a joint ' resolution, so that, by a skin clause of the Constitution, if it shall pass, it passes in the form of a bill, of an act; and as such is subject to the Executive veto. There is something more than meets the eye in thus hastening, to ohallege an issue between the -President and Congress."? The Intelligencer asks, if it can be possible that the Republicans in Congress intend to carry out the programme implied by this joint resolution, by inviting the exercise of the veto power, and by so arraying themselves, Radicals and so-called Conservatives, in solid column, that they will be enabled to j>ass this joint resolution over the objection of the President, if indeed the President shall be thus offensively driven to maintain the position which he has been forced to assume, in obedience to his oath, in reference to restoration, under the Constitution and the laws? The Richmond Sentinel says: "Hon. A. H. H. Stuart not being allowed to take his seat in Congress, as a representative from .Virginia, has returned to his home. We understand that all his colleagues will pursue a similar course. It will meet the general approbation of their constituents." . That is the proper course. Return home, and wait patiently the action of Congress, whatever it may be. 

WASHINGTON NEWS, The Republican members of the Senate last week were in caucus upon the resolutions of Mr. Thaddeus Stevens relating to reconstruction. They are not likely to pass that body without important amendments. It is reported that prominent Republicans in both Houses favor the admission of the Ten ilCBSCC ucivgavivi'i It is stated that the Illinois members urge the donatio* of $100,000 to Mrs. Lincoln, and that this amount will probably be recommended by the select committee to whom this subject was referred. ; ./ The constitutionality of the act of Congress prescribing a test oath in the Federal courts, is now before the Supreme Court, on the application of A. H. Garland, of Arkansas, to be admitted to practise without taking the oath. Mr. Grarland was an attorney of the court before the war, and has received a pardon from * the President. The case has been set for argument, Friday, theloth inst. It will be argued by Mr. Garland himself, Reverdy Johnson and Matt. H. Carpenter, of Wisconsin, on the one side, and by the Attorney General, Mr. Speed, on the other. Horace Greeley, who is now in Washington, has expressed himself substantially in aecord with the President in his reconstruction policy as announced in his message, and earnestly deprecates any division of the majority of Congress. Senor llomero, the Mexican Minister, yesterday received intelligence from Mexico to the effect that the French were retreating from . Chihuahua upou Yera Cruz. It is understood that General Butler is preparing a reply to the censure cast upon him by General Grant, and that it will soon be published. Cotton.?This staple product of the 4'land of flowers" continues to come in by the Virginia and Tennessee railroad. Heavy shipments are daily arriving. The Orange road is unable to convey it away as rapidly as it conies in, and immense piles of bales accumulate about the depot The canal takes off apoition of this class of freight, but not enough to relieve the road. ' We understand that the Southside road is rapidly pushing forward its preparations for transporting freight, and will shortlv be in the field with the rest of the lines.?[Lynchburg Republican. i ?aaeara? ? The Augusta Telegraph says that Hon. E. M. Bruce, formerly a member of the Confederate Congress from Kentucky, now a banker and cotton factor in Augusta, Ga., has sent to Gen. John C. Breckinridge, now an exile from the land of his birth, a check for one hundred tlious- | and dollars. Mr. Bruce is understood to have speculated largely and successful during the last year of the Confederacy.

GOLD. | New York, December 11.?Gold, 1441% LEXANDBIA GAZETT: A" The Accident on the Sooth Side R. R. ?A few days ago, we mentioned a late accident on the South Side R. R. The Lynchburg Virginian gives the following account of iti "For some time past hands have been, engaged in constructing a<; new bridge -at; Robertson's mill, and had1 made .considerable progress with .the work. Early in the evening: of Thursday, it will be remembered, that the wind was very high ; and between one and two: o'clock two spans of the bridge, which bad been put up, but had not been braced, were | blown down, by a severe gust of wind, while i the hands were at work upon them. The crash ed .falling timbers, with men clinging to them, orleapihg into the water far below, presented an appalling scene. The bridge must be some forty or fifty feet above the water. We are gained to announce the immediate death, by the catastrophe, of two persons and the wounding of eighteen others. The killed were Mr; Garrison, of Petersburg, the constructor of the work, and a Mr. Barry. Mr. Garrison, it seems, endeavored to leap to the bank, a distance of forty feet, and was killed .1. i tr. oy tne tremendous concussiuu. xie reteiueu iu this city while the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad was in course of construction, upon which work he was a contractor or engineer. Among the wounded was Capt. Hannah, of Appomattox, who received a fracture. Of the wounded we iearn that most of their injuries are slight, and will not, probably, result seriously in any cases. It is almost miraculous that any of them escaped death." VIRGINIA ITEMS. Gen. Lee's family have arrived in Lexington. They have been living lately in Cumberland county. Last week, in Richmond, a case came up before the Mayor, in which a white man was charged with assault upon a negro, and all the witnesses in the case were negroes. The question arose at once whether the Court could accept negro testimony. The Mayor, without the least hesitation, decided that the laws of Virginia did not admit of such testimony.? He declined, therefore, to try the case. Ananiifla r\P rtanrrAOO GrO 1OQT71 n CT fVir* r>Iari XliUllOCliJUO ui>g^uv/u ?*? v *vu ? tug vmv I tations and flocking into Lynchburg. In consequence of fears of negro outbreaks entertained by some of the people of Virginia, a proposition for the organization of the militia has been submitted to the Legislature of the State. .' j, r ' The Baltimore Gazette says:?"The Report of Lieutenant General Grant to the War Department, concerning the operations of the Federal armies after his appointment to* the chief command, effectually plucks Major Gen. Butler of his military feathers, and leaves him as completely bare as a Shanghai chicken exposed for sale in the market place. The thing is done, too, with a coolness and insousiance that is absolutely refreshing." A dispatch from Wilmington, N. C., says: "The civil authorities are enrolling home-guard companies under an ordinance of the late convention. They are also impressing the arms of citizens. Their authority is questioned, and appeals have been made to the military authorities. General Crook withholds his decision for the present. The reason assigned for the enrolment is the fear of a negro insurrection, of which, however, the dispatch says, there is no danger." The "Fenian .Senate" has deposed O'Mahoney, the "President of the Brotherhood," for "perfidy and malfeasance in office," and elected another man in his nlace. The whole concern seems to be in a "muss." O'Mahooey and his friends denounce the "Senate." The resignation of Gen. Butler has been accepted by the President. There are thousands upon thousands who will rejoice at this. Mr. S. W. Glenn, recently manager of the Norfolk Theatre, who a few days since became the lessee of the Richmond Theatre, left Richmond on Saturday last, to go to Petersburg for some three thousand dollars, which was to be paid as a part consideration for his future lease of the Richmond establishment, and has not since been heaid from. I is believed that lie procured the money, and it is known that he left Petersburg for Richmond on Sunday afternoon. The case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky against Gen.
