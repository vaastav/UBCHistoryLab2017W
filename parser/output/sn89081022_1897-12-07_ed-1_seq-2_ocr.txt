GREAT BBITAIN and Ireland have turned out 54,622,706 gallons of whisky in 1897, over 5,000,000 gallons more than in the previous year. Of this 33, 126,238 gallons were consumed in the United Kingdom and 4,790,181 gallons exported. There are 19S distilleries at work in Scotland, 29 in Ireland', nine in England and one in Wales. MKS. FANXIK M. McKoox owns and manages one of the largest ranches in California. It covers 10,000 acres, about 15 miles from San Diego. Since her husband's death three years ago, Mrs. McKoon, although entirely with out experience at that time,has operat ed it so well that it is now one of the most successful ranches in the country. WALTER DARLINGTON, mayor of Con cordia, Kan., is the largest cattle feed er in north central Kansas this fall and winter. lie has 1,700 head in the vicinity of Big Bend, Phillips county, 500 head near Harlan, Smith county, and 400 head in the vicinity of Concor dia, Cloudy county. He expects to feed over 100,000 bushels of corn this winter. JUST as naval topedoes will fight our battles on the high seas, torpedoes will now be weapons of defense on land as well. Mr. G. W. Glinby, of Brooklyn, has produced an electric tor pedo for use in battles on land. The torpedoes are long, cigar-shaped pro jectiles, mounted on rolling trucks. The machinery to propel them is operated by electricity, furnished by means of a wire connecting with the central station. SNOW statues are the latest form of artistic freak and their creator is M. Pierre Roche, a French sculptor of re pute. The statue is made of copper, :ind in the base is a reservoir of lique fied carbonic acid used to generate the 2old, and the moisture which is ab stracted from the atmosphere forms on the surface of the metal as a coating of snow in the course of a few mo ments, and is prevented from thawing by the freezing mixture. AN old-time swindle seems to have been revived in a letter from a pretend ed officer in the Spanish army, now in a supp6sititious prison in Spain, who claims to have buried a large sum of money near Brazil, Ind. He will give one-third of the entire amount to any person who will remit to him by mall the trivial sum necessary to pay his beloved daughter's passage from Spain to the United states and the necessary expenses of unearthing the treasure. Who speaks first. ON the approach of a thunder storm French peasants often make up a very smoky fire in the belief that safety from lightning is thus assured. By some this is deemed a superstition, but Schuster shows that the custom is based on reason, inasmuch as the smoke acts as a good conductor for carrying away the electricity slowly and safely. He points out that in 1,030 cases of damage by lightning 6.3 churches and 8.5 mills have been struck, whilst the number of factory chimneys has only been 0.3. NEW YORK papers mention a rare rase of personal integrity and business honor which has come to light in that city. In 1861 Mr. Amos F. Eno was a member of a firm which failed shortly after the war began. The stock was sold, the debts paid pro rata and re leases were signed by the creditors. Now. after 35 years, Mr. Eno is paying off the balance of all claims, with four per cent, interest since 1801, amount ing in the aggregate to about $500,000. Such cases as this tend to strengthen commercial integrity everywhere. The French have a decidedly prac tical way of looking at new methods of locomotion. No sooner was the bi cycle established than a large revenue producing tax was imposed on it, and now it has been decided by the French authorities to impose a tax on motor cars, the tax apparently varying in different parts,according to the density of the population. In the large cen ters of population the tax will be a somewhat serious item, and in Paris it amounts to $12 on vehicles for two pas sengers, and $20 on larger vehicles. THE signal corps of. the United States army now operates about 803 miles of military telegraphs. The most notable advance of the year in its system has been the adoption of a combination tel egraph and telephone apparatus which only weighs 16 pounds, and consequent* ly can easily be carried by one soldier. With this apparatus one soldier can telegraph a message to another, while a telephonic conversation with another station can be simultaneously carried on, the distant operators only receiv* ing the messages intended for each. OUR national post office shows a de ficit of between $15,000,000 and $16, 000,000 this year, while the English government has a surplus of about $20, 000,000 annually. The cause of deficit does not rest with-letter postage. That has always paid its way and substan tially supported the whole service. The discrepancy between receipts and ex penditures arises from another source. The loss to the government by second class mail matter is scarcely less than $40,000,000 a year, the established rate for this class being only one-fifteenth of the actual cost of transmission and handling-.

HOPE FOR RECOVERY IS HELD OUT. Physician* Soy the End May Conic nl Any Muincnt—TlieJ*re»ItIeiit JjcavrN for Canton IniiiicTIlately L'uon Re ceipt of tlic Sewn BloKraphival Sketch of the Aged Woman. Canton, 0., Dec. 3.—At an early hour Thursday morning Mrs. Nancy Allison McKinley, the venerable mother of the president, was stricken with paralysis, and her death is believed to be only a question of a short time. Not since Mrs. McKinley was stricken has there been a favorable feature in her condi tion. That the attack would ultimate ly end in death was the first fear of the family on discovering her illness, and the consultations of the attending phy sicians have tended to confirm this be lief. Every effort is being made to ren der the patient comfortable, and what will doubtless prove to be her last ill ness as free from suffering as possible. The paralysis, when it first appeared, was not of a serious form, and seemed only to have affected her vocal chords. MRS. 

NANCY ALLISON M'KINLEY. She was able to walk from her own bed chamber to that of her daughter, Miss Helen McKinley, to give the first intimation of the attack, and at that time seemed to be in possession of all mental and physical faculties, but soon afterward a change was noticed, and in the afternoon she sank into a con dition of semi-consciousness, in which she has since remained. The President Notified. Mr. Abner McKinley communicated with the president as soon as he learned the serious nature of the illness of his mother, and the president asked that he be advised immediately of every change. Appointments were made for communication by telephone, and tele grams were also exchanged frequently. Soon after noon Mr. Abner McKinley notified the president that the sufferer had lapsed into semiconsciousness and promised to communicate further at five o'clock in the afternoon. The president did not wait for the five o'clock message. He responded: "Tell mother I will be there," and at once prepared to start for Canton. He is expected to arrive here at ten o'clock this morning. President Leaves Washington. Washington, Dec. 3.—President Mc Kinley left the city at 7:20 o'clock Thursday night over the Pennsylvania railroad to hasten to the bedside of his sick mother at Canton, where he will arrive to-day. With *him went Judge Day, assistant secretary of state, the two occupying the Pullman car Davy Crockett attached to the regular train. Biographical Sketch. TMrs. McKinley comes of the race of hardy pioneers who laid the founuaiion of the American republic. She was i^.zs Nan cy Campbell Allison, and was born at New Lisbon, O., in 1809. Her family originally came from England to Virginia, thence to Pennsylvania and finally settled perma nently in Ohio. She was married to William McKinley, Sr., January 6, 1S29, and was liv ing in a two-story frame house, still siand ing near Niles, O.. when her distinguished son was born, January 29, 18-13. The re moval from Niles to Mahoning county was prompted by a desire to give her children an academic education. Mrs. McKinley was a woman of sterling qualities, frugal, industrious, pious and proud her son. Her patriotism was strong and passion ate and" her intellectual power was truly wonderful. Her husband died November 24, 1892. Like the mothers of Garfield and Grant, she lived and rejoiced to see her son president of his and her country. When President McKinley entered congress over 20 years ago he was away from his mother much of the time until he retired from con gress to make the canvass for governor in 1891. During his service from 1892 to 189C as governor he went to Canton fre quently to visit his mother, and he was with her from January, 1896, until he went to Washington last March. Previous to en tering public life the president was al ways located near his parents and eot much time with them.] Killed Each Other.

KILLED HIS CHILDREN. Mystery of the Murder of Two Little Ones In Wisconsin Cleared l'p. Oconomowoc, Wis., Nov. 30.—Ernest Cornell has confessed that it was he who slaughtered his two innocent chil dren one week ago last Saturday morn ing, and that after committing the deed he attempted suicide, and thus is cleared away the mystery of one of the most bloody crimes ever known in this county. The victims of Cornell's rash act were a son, Willie, aged six years, and a daughter, Lillie, aged four years, and they were killed with blows from a hammer on the head, after which he cut their throats. The statement that Cornell had confessed was made pub lic at the inquest of the bodies of the children, when Deputy Sheriff Palmer, Dr. Wilkinson and Charles Glidden, who nursed Cornell, all testified that Cornell had confessed to them that he committed the bloody deed. Cornell in his statement says he was drunk at the lime he committed the deed. WAY SEND SUPPLIES. Relief Measure* for Klondtkeri Dis cussed by the Cabinet. Washington, Dec. 1.—The cabinet Tuesday considered the subject of send ing relief to the people in the Klon dike. President McKinley received a telegram from the Portland (Ore.) chamber of commerce, stating that there was danger of destitution and suffering on the Klondike and offering to supply the necessary food for re lief if the government would under take its transportation. It was decided that nothing could be done until congress met, when au ap propriation will be ashed for the pur pose of transporting food supplies. Al though many plans have been discussed, none has been decided upon. It is prob able, however, that whatever action is taken will be under the direction of the war department, and by the time con gress acts Secretary Alger will have formulated plans. 

RECORD-BREAKING RUN. Union Pncliic Train Makes G19 Miles. In B2U Minutes. Omaha, Neb., .Nov. 30.—The Union Pa cific fast mail at 5:30 o'clock Monda3' night completed the longest record breaking run ever made—519 miles in 520 minutes. The run was made from Chej'enne to Omaha. The train con sisted of two mail cars for the eastern mail matter. The fast run was neces sary to avoid a heavy fine, as the mail was delayed by a burning bridge. The mail cars were detached and the record run of the road and of the country made. At some points along the line the train made actually 100 miles an hour for as much as ten minutes at a time. Six stops were made for coal and water. Railroad men pronounce it the marvel of record runs to the present time.

AUTHORITY OFTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL. He Will Exercise Supreme Command —Displeasure at Washington Over the Cuban Document Insnrscnts Say They Will Ignore It—Summary of the Decrees. Madrid, Nov. 29.—The Official Ga zette publishes the royal decrees grant ing autonomy for Cuba and Porto Rico. An outline follows: Article explains the principles of the future government of the two islands. Article 2 decrees that the government of each island shall be composed of an insular parliament, divided into two chambers, while a governor-general, representing the home government, will exercise in Its name the supreme authority. Article 3 declares that the faculty of mak ing laws on colonial affairs rests with the insular chambers and the governor-gen eral. Article 4 directs that the insular repre sentation shall be composed of two cor porations, with equal powers, viz.: a cham ber of representatives and a council of ad ministration. Article 5 provides that the council of ad ministration shall consist of S5 members, of whom 18 shall be elected and 17 be nom inated by the home government. Article provides that the members of the council of administration must be Spaniards, at least 35 years of age, who were born in the island or who have re sided there continuously for four years. It specifies numerous officials such as sen ators, presidents of courts and of cham bers of commerce and other bodies as eligible to election to the council. Aticles 7 to 14 inclusive deal with nom inations and the conditions of election to councils. Aticle 15 empowers the throne, or the governor-general, to convoke, suspend or dissolve the chambers, with an obligation to reassemble them within three months. Articles 16 to 2S deal with the procedure of the chambers and grant immunity to members. Article 29 empowers the insular parlia ment to receive the governor's oath and make effective the responsibility of the secretaries forming the governor's council. Secretaries may be impeached by the chambers, in which case they are to be judged by the council of administration. Negotiations for treaties of commerce are to be made by the home government, with the assistance of the secretaries of the island. Article 39 confers upon parliament the Imposing of customs duties. Article 40 deals with the commercial rela tions of the islands with the peninsula and provides that no import or export tax may differ to the prejudice of the productions of either island or the peninsula. A list will be formed of articles coming from Spain direct, which will be granted favor able treatment in regard to similar articles coming from abroad, and the same will be done for productions of the islands en tering Spain, the differential duty in no case to exceed 35 per cent. The remainder of the decree explains the governor-general's powers. He will exer cise supreme command, be responsible for the preservation of order, have free power to nominate officials, and his secretaries he will publish and execute the laws and decrees, international treaties and con ventions, etc., and will have the power of pardoning, suspending constitutional guar and ordering a state of siege,j3houid circumstances require it. 3.—antees Displeasure at Washington. Washington, Nov. 29.—Spain's latest scheme for autonomy for Cuba is not well received in Washington. The pub lication made in the Official Gazette of Madrid, containing a summary of the royal decrees, has produced a most un favorable impression here. Careful ex amination of the scheme discloses that a string is attached to every pretended concession to Cuba, and leads inevitably to the conclusion that the Spanish statesmen are at their old tricks of throwing dust into the eyes of the world in general and of the people of the United States in particular. It is already apparent that Spain is not able to deceive anyone with these decrees. Will Not Be Heeded. New York, .Nov. 29.—Tomas Estrada Palma, the Cuban delegate in this city, speaking on the terms of the autonomy decrees, said: "These propositions were scorned in advance of their presenta tion. They can receive no considera tion now. With Cuba it is as it has been since the war began and will be until it ends—indepndence or death." Notes Business Improvement. Washington, Dec. 2.—Assistant Secre tary Meikeljohn, of the war depart ment, returned to the city Wednesday after a six weeks' tour of inspection of military posts from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. lie said that he had noted everywhere an improvement in busi ness conditious, and a growing confi dence that the country was entering once more on au era of prosperity.
