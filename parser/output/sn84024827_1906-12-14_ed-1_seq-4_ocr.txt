THE SVT.WAY rnoisuiM. At a meeting of the City Council on Wednesday night, at which time M. Newman, of the Arm of Frankenberg Rn t- N'rumin. demanded of the Council a decision regarding the posi tion of tha city with reference to the subway alley in rear of Main street, tho rvinnel! nriil the people are brought face to face again with a prob lem which should be settled now, anu for all time. There are several vexatious ques tions entering into the disposition by the city of the subway alley, and the decision cr the Council will mean much or nothing towards the Improve ment of the appearance of the citj and the convenience of pedestrians and traffic - As a general proposition, the Re Iew bellees It to be the best plan to keep the subway street open. The flrit argument In favor of this propo sition Ik tho crowded and congested condition of our bu.lne quarter. Blsbee is woefully lacking in business streets and insteaj of narrowing, arch ing or closing any highway, the best policy would be to extend, open and kroaden our streets In order to better accommodate our Increasing trade and growing population. The subway alley could be transformed into a buMnes street. It r-ould relieve the crowded condition C Main street and. afford locations i'r more handsome buildings in that locality and be an Inducement for- inve'tor looking for a buslnes location, to Invent their money In TiUbce, Instead of othT localities far ther av-ay ft 3m the hub.

After the day's business Is over the marketmen of Berlin are in the "habit of Indulging In basket foot races that are highly diverting. Sometimes a dozen or more of them enter Into a competition which prescribes that each contestant shall carry ten empty vegetable baskets on his head. The first to arrive at the post receives a prise, provided he has not left any of hi baskets along the course, tlon on the abutting property owners hard political fighter, but he cviden' on Main street and the subway alley. My does not care to take toe Job of together with assessing one-fifth of tho general expense upon the taxpayers In general, or appropriating this amount from the general street fund, the Re view believes a popular decision will have been reached which win equally distribute the expense where it prop erly belongs. Certainly the t;r;ct mer the KUb way should not be made an unsightly alley, roofed over head with frame connections to business houses on Main street, dark and foul smelling, before every effort has been exhaust ed looking toward a clean, broad bus iness thoroughfare, affording location for more .bu-lnet-s houses In the busi ness center. AN UNSAFE MOVE. The president has bent a .special message to congress asking for the initiative and responsibility to dis miss any officer of the army orjnarj whom he thinks unworthy to remain the executive authority upon his own In the service. The existing law pro vides that in time of peace no officer shall be dismissed from the service except, in pursuance of a court-martial or in mitigation of a sentence. This provision the president desires to have repealed. This recommendation will not com- mend'ilself to the sense of justice of the country. To dismiss an officer ffomtite' service Is in the nature of capital punishment; It deprives him in a vast majority of cases of his liv ing, and, more than that, of his char acter and good nani3.'QUnder tho con stitution cf the United States a citi zen cannot legally bo deprived of one dollar of his property without due pro cess of law, and here it Is proposed to make it legal to. strip an army 01 naval officer of everything that is val uable to him upon the mere dictum of the president. No officer w;6uld ever be safe from an emotional impulse or an outburst of anger to which: presi dents, like other men, are subject. Mr. Roosevelt bases his recommend ation upon the case of a naval officer who was accused otj indecent and dls custing behavior, was convicted by the court martlal.tut the sentence im underwriting election beta.

ZION CITY AND SOCIALISM. ' In the final collapse of the ''Aon City movement the Chicago Chronicle reads a significant xssuogy to the Utopian dreams of socialism. The analogy is drawn of Dowle's experi ment and the alms and purposes of the social reformers v: o extol the communistic ilea. It Is cited, for in stance, that in Wiliam Alfred Hind's ties" there are presented about forty serious experiments of communistic life, of which all have failed complete ly, although in each instance the out look appeared oromis-ng at the start and for a time eaca community thrived. This was due In most ca3es to the vitality Imparted through re ligious motA-ea, which gave the lead ers perfect control of their follower'. Dowie could nevvr nave accom plished even tempo.'ary success had It not been that Zioa City was essen tially a religious organization and to that extent its members were of a tractable class who -were willing tools In the masterful hands of Dowie. But the fundamental ms;ake of all so cialism, the Chronicle points out, whether It be Utopian or scientific. Is that it Is predicated upon the theo ry that normally all men and women are honest, unselfish, of equal Intelli gence and free from all temptations of diciet and ambition. Socialists ar gue that men and romen are abnor mal because of abnormal social condi tions and bad laws. If such conditions and laws are done away with, says the socialists, It leaves humanity in a state of Ideal mobility. Hut as murders are not the result of laws, against slaughter, ea are the sius of humanity not the result of le gal restrictions or f.oc:a! proscrip tion. They exist In cp:ie" or laws, and while our social conditions may not be perfectly attuned there !s no rea son to believe there would be less sin in the world under any other form of order. Upon this piase of the mat ter the Chronicle says: 'If this is the theory of every small community RoOK-evclt-jhas plungr himself Into an embarrassing situation an J Mrs. Storer will .have khe last word you can bet on 'that . 2t " me of the members "of the ap proaching legislature aro wondering how- they will reach the capital.

There will be something doing around the court house next week. The spfdal territorial grand Jury will be In session. Likewise the United State grand Jury and trial Jury, and In addition the Board of Supervisors will have a short session. Ztfr&&&4f$4rt& I THE BANK OF BISBEE ! BISBEE.

NECKWEAR PURSES SILK WAISTS was too lenient. But there is an anc ient maxim of law worth of all ac ceptation, that it is belter that ninety and nine guilty persons escape than that one innocent person should be punished. It Is human to err, and now and then, without dou'St court-martials err. bometlmes on the side of mercy and sometimes by undue severity But in the main, the officers In both branches of the service are.as a body, as keenly sensitive of the honor of their profession, as honestly solici tous to purge it of BEFonax mem bers, as the presides ean possibly be. A court-martial composed of trained and honest men who baTe patiently investigated a case and heart the sworn testimony of tne witnesses and noted the bearing of each on the wit ness stand Is a tribunal which the president should be ole to trust, if its members err as they someumes ao. they commit a fault from which even presidents are not always exempt. To dismiss a military olcial is a far more serious matter than to dismiss a person from a civil oilier. Tne civil ian goes Into the civil Berrsce. gen erally, a3 a temporary occupation, not loosening his hold -m other things. And yet, one of the greatest rerorms of this generation has been the- enact ment of a number of civil service laws which protect the government clerk and nearly all the civil employes of the government from crailrary dis missal. Even before any civil ser vice reform had been thought of. there was a president of the United States ln whose hands congress did not deem It safe to trust civilian offi cials, but tied his hvnCS by the enact- tment of the celebrated "Tenure in Office" bill. When a naval odeer or an army officer Is dismissed from the carvlco bis life is. ruined. He is denrlved cf hla. character, his standing- among men and of his cmplo mentr and when these are gone there are few gainful occupations open to hlw. ouht he to be deprived of these things eiccp! by ths judgmcat. of a duly autnorlzed and properly constituted court? It would not bo common justice to.do it. o R. A. Kirk-, chairman of the county republican central committee, states that when he was approached and asked to make tho Douglas contest a party matter he refused to have anything- to do with it- Kirk Is" case there would bo no nc:ccn days of peace, purity and contentment By the time the new order was organized it would be found mat a few smart devils had comeres the hoIe thing There would be a species of tyr anny, oppression and poverty such as the world has never known." It Is not an accident that Zion City went Into bankruptcy. The result was In evitable. The movement was merely another Inthe long procession of re ligious and social theories that are founded upon false predications. o Tucson seems to be jotaee to Its idols. That city elected a republican major this week by more than 250 majority. The democrats elected the city clerk and the treasurer, but the republicans got the major ana alt the coucellmen. Both the daily papers supported Mayor Manning, who made an excellent executive officer during the last two years. Mr. Manning was elected two years ago on a platform pledging that public gambling should bo ribolishcd In Tucson. Ho made good on that promiso soon after his election and now practically all the democrats and all the republicans arc agreed that gambling shall .never re turn to the city. o Hon. Neil Bailey, it Is believed, v.ljl be the speaker of the coming assem bly. So sure doss Galley feel about this that he has gone down into the state of Georgia to get a bag of pea nuts to pass around amon? the boys In token of his gratitude for tho hon or. . '. o The territorial Live Stock associa tion adopted a resolution asking that 'roping content:." bo made unlawful, Their wishes in this matter chould be respected. It is a cruel sport that should not Ik- tolerated by, a civilized people. Blade 'O The TfuRjon Star claims that be cause tne democrat? In that city op- ricjPd Joist-statehood tRey lost the city election. We doubt if the ques tion of statehood had anything to do with recent political results In the old pueblo, but attribute them to the prevalence of too much cussedness in that city. o
