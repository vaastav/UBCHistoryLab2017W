State IToubo Dee. 13. The autombile bill passed the House this morning, 121 to 08, tfter a long discussion which involved a yea snd nay rote on the question of the dismissal of the bill, snd a vote on amendments which made the tax just half what it would be according to the provisions of the bill. The bill of Mr. Howe of St. Johnsbury, wtucb raises the tax on railroads one- fourth of one per cent, on the gross earn ings passed the Home this morning with out opposition and then tho bill which repeals the sections of the statutes giv ing the railroads the option to pay taxes on the gross earnings was discussed at ler;rth, not being disposed of at noon, The members of the special taxation committee was announced this morning and the committee met for organization this noon. The Senate asked for a com mittee of conference on the much dis cussed printers bill, and the following senators were named, Butler, Lewis of Orleans, Kidder, Sherwin and McLam. Adjournment question is still in the air. It may be thst the effort will still be made to close up the business and ad journ the dav before Christmas, but as was supgested earlier in the ses.iion, the unfinished business makes it appear al most an impossibility. The fact that the House this morning voted not to permit the special taxation committee to meet during the sessions gave strength to the idea of adjourning either Friday or Sat urday of this week, until after" the holi day season. The date would probably bo January 4. Special Committee on Taxation, Addison couuty.

The Automobile Bill. Mr. Davis of Springfield, who talks on practically all of the subjects, apparently as a matter of system, led off the discus sion opposing the auto taxation bill on the ground that the principle was wrong to tax owners on the horse-power of their machines. Mr. Kinsley of Rutland moved an amendment to the bill, which cut the tax propsed of practically one dollar a horse power in two, in the interests of justice, lie believed also if this bill were passed the summer visitors whose machines cut up the roads as well as those within the state, should be taxed. He stated that at Manchester there were 1,100 automobiles that stop ped at the Equinox House during the season. Mr. Martin of Plainfield believed the measure was just and that the machines should pay for the roads they damaged. Mr. Williams of Newport believed the principle of the bill was all right and the tax proposed just. Mr. Locklin of Richford believed the machines should be I taxed In the towns where owned. I Mr. Leary of Burlington made a strong Tr)t nrfnmttt: lilM In wrlJl tin tiff ed that he believed all property should be taxed according to its true value. The second year a machine would not be worth anywhere near what it was the first year and yet it was still taxed ac- cording to the horse power according to the bill. As to putting a tax on ma chines coming into the state, he said that he didn't believe in putting a little Chinese exclusion law around Vermont. Then Mr. Martin of losses made a strong speech in favor of the bill, in which he stated that the automobile was peculiar piece of property and that the intent cf the. bill was to have them pay for the damage they did to the roads. He believed the grading of the tax was just. Mr. EeRoer of Montpelier opposed the bill, saying that the automobile was- i mucn a piece oi personal property as anything else, and that it should be taxed in the town. Otkers spoke on the measure and finally Mr. Martin of Brook. ine moved that the bill be dtsmised. The motion was killed 137 to SO. Then the question of Mr. Kinsley's amend ments was taken up, snd thev were killed. Then Mr. Tucker of Tunbrida-e. who favoned the bill, called for the veas and nays on the pssape of the bill, but withdrew the demand, and the bill passed on a rising vote 121 to fiC Mr. Howe of Bennington took the chair for a time and House bill .153 bv Mr. Howe of t. Johnbury passed with out opposition. It was "a measure of vast importance, as it raised the tax on railroads en!-fourth per cent., or made be tax fl.l'AO a thousand, instead of a tt!e over fS. This passed without much ltoss famines. Mr. Hitchcock of Pitts ford opposed the bill, saying that the grons earnings system was tne one, in use all over tho county. 410 was op posed to raising the tax on railroads mi lens there was some creat need lor more money bv the tat. The fcen,te killed the bill requiring street . railroads to. provide waiting rooms. The Senate aUo asked thfl.llousn for a committee of conference to see if the matter of paving certain publishing houses could not be settled.

Bennington, Dec IS., Rt, Rev. M. 3. Cloaree, vicar general of the Catholic dioceseo f Burlington, has received a message from Lourdes, France, stating that Bishop John II. Michaud, who went there about six weeks ago for the benefit of his health, is expected to live only a few days longer, unless miraculously cured. These are the words of the biohop of Lourdes, who recently gave Bishop Michaud the last rites of the church. Since his srrival in Kurone he has been rapidly sinking. He has become so weak that the physi cians will not allow him to make the rrtnrn trip. Bishop Michaud himself believes he is going to die in a short time and has made all preparations for hia fun eral. Among his wishes are that he should be buried in Burlington. Vt., that Bihop B"aven of Springfield, Mass., should ,o!erte. tb mass of rqmem, and that Kev. A. J.

While passing out of the Union school in Montpclier yesterday afternoon with a party of mates, ten years-old Jacob Yett, son of Isaac Yett, walked, all un conscious of danger, beneath the eaves of the roof, where hung suspended a great quantity of snow and ice which needed but a jar to be released. Just at that moment the mass became loosened and fell with great forceP the distort eo from the eaves to the ground bing sixty feet. Young Yett did not get tho full weight of the accumulation, but a frag ment of ice struck him squarely on the bead, felling him to the ground and in flicting fatal Injuries. . He was picked up in an unconscious conditon and was carried into the office of Sunt. Brownscombe in the same build ing, it was soon seen that he was badly injured, and Dr. F. E. Steele was sum moned to attend him. Subsequently it was decided to place hira in the Heaton hospital so that the injuries might the better be attended to. But the ice had fractured the skull, and death ensued at half-past three o'clock this morning, just twelve hours after the accident. The lad's father was in Bethel at the time of the accident, but a telephone mesttage son acquainted him with the news of the accident and he returned to Montpelier last night. The body was taken to Burlington this morning for interment. He was a bright little fellow and had many friends in Montpelier. He was the son of one of the lett Bros., who are in business there. That there was danger of just such an accident as did happen had been called to the attention of the authorities in Montpelier, it is said. The roof of the Union schoolhouse is not provided with snow and ice guards, so that when the mass becomes too heavy it slides off and falls the considerable distance of sixty feet to the ground. One of the side doors had been closed for the very reason that its use was considered dangerous owing to the overhanging sno and ice. WANT SHORTER HOURS.
