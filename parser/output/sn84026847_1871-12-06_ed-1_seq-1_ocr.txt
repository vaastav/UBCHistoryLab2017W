Laid on table. TUE KUKIXX CALL FjR INFORMATION. Mr. Blair moved to take up his reso lution, introduced yesterday,' 'asking the President to inform the" Senate" by what authority he has suspended the Constitution and Laws of the United States and of South Carolina, in several counties of that State, and said this resolution contemplates obtaining from the President a detailed account of the manner in which he has exer cised the extraordinary authority con ferred upon him by Congress. I under stand that large numbers of citizens have been arrested for alleged crimes in 5>outb Carolina, in the counties designa ted, and that those arrested were arrested for alleged crimes committed before the passage of the act of April 20, giving the Presi dent this authority. I have seen in the papers statements of the names of the parties arrested and the crimes alleged to have been committed by them, and they appear to have been the same instances or circumstances in regard to which the committee on Outrages in the Southern States have examined witnesses. These circumstances all occurred prior to the passage of the act under which the President proclaimed martial law, and these arrests appear to have been made for offenses, or alleged offenses, committed anterior to the time that the Federal courts had any juris diction, and anterior to the time when the authority was conferred upon the President. Mr. Edwards (interrupting) asked the Chair whether a discussion of the merits of the resolution was in order on a motion to take up. The Chair declared that it was not. Mr. Morton ? It occurs to me the substance of this resolmion wag pretty well answered by the President's mes sage. But aside from that this resolu-j tion can be much better discussed after j we shall have received the report of the Investigating committee. For this reason 1 shall vote against taking it up Mr. B'air ? The President's messige does not give us any information at all in reference to the matter about which this resolution asks information. This j resolution asks for the names of parties arrested there for crimes alleged to have been committed by them and the times ' at which they are alleged to have been committed, and none of these are given in the President's message. The Pres ident states that the testimony taken by the committee on Southern Affairs) amply sustains him in his proclamation of martial law. I don't know how he got that information. Certainly not by any report from that committee. No one was authorized by the committee! to make any such report to tfie Presi dent, and as a member of it I can give i my opinion that the facts elicited by the committee do not justify the proclamation of martial law, and I suspect that I know more about those actions than the President himself. While I am not astonished that the J President should have exercised the extraordinary power conferred upon him, as his education and his genius being arbitrary, makes him favor arbi trary measures, I am astonished etj the servility of Congress in submi:t!ng I the rights of citizens to bis dictation, and I believe that it becomes us, having given him such authority, to ask him to tell us bow be has executed it. Mr. Conkling ? I think the reason assigned by the Senator from Indiana! (Mr. Morton) against taking up thiSj resolution now is a good one, and I beg to add another. A resolution calling for information upon any appropriate subject is always entitled to considera tion and indulgence, and particularly when a gooi one in all respects is set apart. But this resolution, among other things, is full of assertion and intimidation, which pay fall apart from the assertion. Although I do not pro pose now to discuss the merit or error of the resolution in that regard, it is enongh that it contains so much of that kind of matter that it does not, in my estimation, fall fairly within the cate gory of resolutions seeking information, and" therefore I should vote against taking it up now, or any time, unless it was reduced to a real resolution of inquiry, in which case there might, perhaps, be no objection to it, at least none of the kind that I now specify. The motion to take up was lost? yeas, 11; nays. 45, only Mr. Tipton among the Republicans voting in the affirma tire. Bj Mr. Cameron ? A resolution call- j ingon the President for the official cor respondence on the retirement of Mr. Cat acazr. Adopted. The Vice President laid before the Senate the House bill declaring the meaning ot the eight hour lair. Mr. Trumbull oflfered an amendment abolishing the law. Mr. \Vil90n urged the immediate passage of the bill. After some discussion, ths Senate, at 1:23, accounted. 

HOUSE. BILLS INTRODUCED. By Mr. Strong ? Granting pensions to the soldiers and sailor* of the war of 1812 for forty days' e service. By Mr. Hill ? Authorizing the Post master General to issue one cent corre spondence or postal cards. By Mr. Wells, of Missouri ? Appro priating money for the purchase of a site and the erection of buildings for a custom house, postoffice and other Fed eral offices at St. Louis. Mr. Farnsworth, from the Postoffice committee, reported a bill to re vise and amend the statutes re lating to the Postoffice Department. , lie stated that it was the same bill which passed the House at the last Congress, after having been very strong ly considered by two committees in conjunction with a commission of ex perts appointed by the Postmaster Gen eral. it wai simply a codification of thep08tal laws with a few amendments not generally of importance but neces sary to have the law clear and harmo nious. The postal laws had never been codified since the organization of the department, and many of them had be come obsolete while others were contra dictory and difficult of explanation. The clerk proceeded to^read the bill, which was very voluminous. Tne reading of the bill was interrupt ed by the expiration of the morning hour, when the House went into com mittee of the Whole, Mr. Wheeler in the chair, on the President's annual message. The usual resolution distributing por tions of the message among the appro priate committees was offered by Mr. Dawes and adopted. Before the vote was taken on the resolution, Mr. Wood, (Democrat,) of New York, inqi'red whether there was any such committee as the committee on Insurrectionary States. He denied that there were any insurrectionary States or any such committee. Mr. Dawes, (Republican,) of Massa chusetts, said he would not now discuss the question of fact, but would state that there was a committee which went by that r.ame, and was raised last ses sion for the purpose of considering the subject which it was now proposed to refer to it, the Ku-Klux outrages. Mr. Wood remarked that several efforts bad been made last session to revive the Insurrection committee, and that the House had, on every occasion, voted down the proposition. The com mittee on Insurrectionary States was brought into existence for temporary purposes, togo into the Southern States to ascertain things, and when that com mittee had reported to the House it had no further functions. He was, there lore, opposed to reviving it for a whole Conirre^s in this surreptitious manner. Mr. Dawes paid, in reply to Mr. Wood, that the terms by which that committee was constituted provided that it should coutinue during the present Congress; but, even if that were not so, there had been yesterday referred to the committee some measures which would have survived it had it expired. Mr. Wo jd supposed that, with such a declaration on the part of the leaders of the house, the Democratic side was to assume that it was intended to keep in existence a committee formed os ten atiouslv for the purpose of preserv ing order, but really, and in fact, for the purpose of promoting disorder. For himself, personally, and without con sultation with others, he protested against the continu tnce of a law which was not only useless, but promotive of disorder and distraction throughout the country. A debate sprung upon the proposi tion to refer to a select committee that part of the President's message which recommended the absorption of the telegraph into the postal system. Mr. Dawes offered and supported the resolution which was opposed by Messrs Farnsworth, Randall, Xiblack and Banks. Alter a long discussion the proposi tion was referred to the Postoffice com mittee, instead of to a eelect committee. After the committee rose, however, the subject was revived and a vote being taken in the House on the re'erence of the telegraph project, the proposition was referrel to the committee oji Appropriations by a vote of yeas 105, navs ys. At 3:30 P. M. the House adjourned.

The court ' room, as yesterday, was crowded to its full capacity, including many ladies, a dozen or more negroes filling up the background. The prisoner, wit& her daughter by her side, both deeply veiled and attended by Mrs. Neilson and daughter, pat immediately in rear of her counsel. Alter the formal opening of the court, the clerk proceeded to call the nameaof the venire summoned yes terday. from which four jurymen were I to be selected.to complete the jury, and before exhausting the list John H. \ Sellman, firmer; R. W. Shecklea, farmer; George W. Walking, merchant, and Robert II. Welsh, furrier, were de clared competent jurors and sworn in.

The French Assembly. .Paris, December 5. ? Tbe attitude ot the Assembly is generally construe 1 hp being favorable to tbe maintenance of peace with tbe present foreign relations of the country in statu quo. *Tbe sub ject of needed reforms in the army and civil service, referred to in President Thiers' message, will be brought promi nently before the Assembly for disu nion at an early day. The influence o! the radical element in the Assembly is declining, and the present session will, in all probability, be characterized by much less party spirit and greater unanimity of action than formerly. The Sen Diamond Field*. London, December 5. ? The British Government has annexed the lately dis covered diamond fields at Cape of Good Ilope. These fields, so far as worked, have given proof of extraordinary richness, equaling, if not surpassing, any of the tamous diamond beds for merly discovered in that region. Uerman Postal Eawr-Pay of Sol dlerw. Strasbourg, November 5. ? An im perial decree fixes the 1st of January, 1872, as the day on which the German postal law is to come in force. According to the provisions of the Franco-German treaty of peace, all substitutes serving in the army are secured their pay, although their term of service is not yet up. Many substi tutes, in ignorance of this, have went to France to complete their term, but the Strasbourg Official Gazelle calls their attention to the clause to avoid lurther emigrating. The French Government has declared its willingness to pay the amounts. Decline* a CJIft. Vienna, December 5. ?

INTERVAL RETEML I Aononl Report of the Commiiil?B?r Commissioner Douglas has submitted his annual report, covering the transac tions of the Internal Revenue Office ; during tbe administration of Hon. C. Delano, from July 1 to November 1, 1870; his own administration a? Acting Commissioner, from November 1, 1870, to January 3, 1871 ; Hon. A. Pleas anton. from January 3, 1871, to June 30, 1871, and his own administration as ' Commisfeioner since that date. The aggregate receipts from all sources, exclusive of the direct tax upon lands hn l the duty upon tlie circulation and deposits of national banks, were for the fiscal year 1871, $144,011,176.24, which sum includes the amounts re funded and allowed on drawbacks. The drawbacks allowed amounted to $22, 887 97. This amount is augmented by the allowances on account of the adjudi cation of old claims for drawback on coiton gooes, rendered admissible by the joint resolution of Congress of Julv 14, 1870. Amouut refunded during the year for taxes illegally assessed and collected, ?617,581 07. This large increase over the preceding year was due to the ad justment of claims that had been sus pended during former years for more complete consideration. The claim of one State was embraced in the above, amounting to $45,866. The estimate of the receipts for the current fiscal vear under the present law is $125,000,000. The number of spirit distilleries regis tered during the year was 1043; num ber of iruit d:st;lleries registered, 7149 Total, S192.

The total product of manufactured tobacco represented by the amount o! collections during the year was lu5,828, %3 pounds. In relation to the mode of collecting revenue rorn tobacco, the Commissioner says: "The s-teady and uniform in crease, from month to month, in the r-vetiic derived trorn manufactured tobicc o, cigar-, Ac , since the pre-ent law went into op-ration, by which the mode of collecting taxes ou these arti cles was changed from an as-essment a.'ter removal 'r un the mannfactory and sale, to a prepayment, bv means of suitable stamp-, before the goods are removed from the p!ace of manufac ture, haa fully demonstrated the supe riority of the present system over fhe former. Few frauds are possible while the taxes are required to be paid at the manu:a;tory, and before the goods are allowed to go upon the market, and where every package is required to bear upon it the evidence that the tax has peen pa d. " Concerning t'.e advantage to be de rived from fix rig a uniform rat* of tax upon tobacco, the Commissioner says : "From the tables profited in this report it will be seen that more than two thirds of the manufactured tobacco which reached taxation during the last fiscal ytar paid the tax of 32 ceDta per pound, yielding four-filths of the rev enne which was collected directly trom the article by stamps. Had a tax been collected at a unitorm rate of 32 cents per poucd on tbe entire product of man ufactured tobacco which reached taxa tion during the last fiscal year, tbe receipts there rorn would have been $30, 443,361 28. Adding to this sum the taxes collected ou cgars, the special tax-s of manufacturers of tobacco and cigars, of dealers in leaf, and dealers in manufactured tobacco, Ac., tbe total receipts would have been $38,461,728. 79. Similar calculations abow that a uniform tax of 24 cents per pound on tbe eame quality would have realized the turn of f 30, 859,888.47, and that a uniform rata of 16 canta per pound wou'd have realized the sum of $23, 240,048.15. Thus it will be seen that on the assumption that the same num ber of pounds would have reached tax ation had the rate of tax been uniform, either at 16,24, or 32 cents per pound, a uniform rate of 32 cents would have j increased the revenue by the sum ol 1 $4,882 821 .61. while a uniform rite of | 24 or 16 cents would have diminished thoee receipts in the sums resi*ctivelv of $2,728,018.71 and $10,338,859 03 1 am awAre that it is contended by tho<*e ! who advocate a reduction or the tax to a uniform rate of 16 cents per pound j that the increased consumption which J would result from such a reduction, an 1 j the greater number of pounds which would reach taxation, would netrlr, if not quite, compensate for the reduction in the rate. I am unable, however, to see anv well grounded reason for such a conclusion ? first, because such a re duction would have little, if any, ten dency to increase the consumption of smoking tobacco, as nearly all smoking tobacco now |<ays but 1G cents tax; secondly, such a reduction alone would not tend to diminish the quantity of raw or leaf tobacco consumed, for most of the leaf tobacco sold directly to con sumer^ is used for smoking purposes, and the motive to smoke untaxed leal would not be removed or lessened by diminishing the tax on chewing tobac co; thirdly, because whatever increase, in consumption there ini^ht be from such a reduction in the rate must nec essarily be of chewing tobacco, of plug, twist, fine cut, <fec., and of snuff, and of these the consumption would have to be doubled, making it one hundred and twenty-eight millions of pounds, where it is now only sixty-four millions of pounds, in order to obtain the same amount of revenue as was collected the last fiscal year. Such an increase in the consumption of chewing tobacco is not to be expected. "My own opinion is, that with the tax at 24 cents, taking into account the natural increase oi the revenue as shown between the collections of i-ucceeding years, and with the advantage of some legislation hereinafter recommended, we shall be able to keep the collections on tohacco up to those under the pres ent rates. *' This recommendation, however, is made without regard to its relation to future total revenue results. It it should be the opinion ol Congress that the yield of revenue from internal taxes should not be materially decreased, then, to accomplish the desirable re sults expected Iroin a consolidation 01 the tax on tobacco, and to compensate in part to the revenue the expected large lo9s from< the expiration of the income tax during the current fiscal year, and the lurtl?er material loss from 'articles and occupations formerly taxed, but now exempt,' (a rapidly decreasing item, of course,) I wou d advise a con solidation of the) tobacco tax at 32 cents per pound." The Commissionerexprcs^es the opin ion that the principal frauds in the p ment of tobacco are effected through the instrumental ty of peddler*, and ret - ommend-, in order to put an end to this illicit traffii-, that every person who sells, or offers to sell, manuiartured tobacco, snuff, or cigtrs from wagon*, in tlie manner of peddlers traveling from place I to place, be required to pay a special tax of fifteen, twenty-live or fifty dol lars, accord 'ogr as they travel with o u\ two or more horses or mules, ?n l to comply with such re.-ul t lions a-t may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner call* attention to the !act that a lartre and increasing amount of raw or leaf tobacco is sol 1 annual'y at retail directly to onsumer without payment of tax. Tins trade s a subject of complaint by the manu facturers, who allege that "it is a serious injury to their business, from which they ask to be protected. On thi* point the Commissioner says : "I would recoii?mend that ?ec ion 59 of the act of July 2>), 1 80S. be so amended as to impose a special tax of five hundred dollars on everv person who shall n ake a business of sellin/ raw or leaf tobacco to persons other than those who have paid sp cial tax as leaf dealers, or as manufacturers of to bacco. snuff or cigars, or who snail s-ll leaf tobacco in quantities les-t than twenty-tiv.- poun Js.or who shall sell -uch tobacco directly to consumers, or tor consumption, without its being manu factured. And it this is not deemed sufficient, I wouid further recommend such a tax on the sales o' such dealers in excess of $5000 annually, as Wv,uld be equivalent to the tax on the same amount and value of man u fact ured to bacco Such a provision of law w;|| ' not only give the required protection to ' the manufacturer, who now pavs a special tax for carrying oi his busi ness, in addition to aapecific tax on all ! his produce, but it will also, I am per i sua>ied, tend largely to increase the Government revenue from this source." Concerning the system of bonded warehouses, the Commissioner givss figures to show that less than halt the tobacco, Ac., removed in bond from tbe manufactories is actually exported. In view of these fact*, the Commis sioner says: "It is my own opinion, and, so far as I have been able to ascer tain, it is the opinion of manufacturers i of tobacco grnerallv. that the present ! system of export bond<*d warehouses can be entirely abolished to the interest both of the Government and of tbe' manufacturers " ? # ? # The Commissioner refers at some length to the changes which have be*n made during the past vear in relation to the production, of stamp*, so as to prevent frauds and im tat ons. These changes have been particularly noticed in the newspapers from time to time as thev have been made, and are sufficiently understood without further mention. An abstract of caaes compromised bv tbe Bureau during tbe year shows that the Government has received from this source f6 18,497 93. Reports of district I attorneys show tbe total number of suits commenced by them agifost par ties during tbe year to be 6977. Toial number decided io favor of the United States. 3182; total number decided ?gainst the Government, 456 Tbe total valu* of property seized by tbe Government officers during the year for violations of internal revenue law was 1915,240.14. The Commissioner reviews the recom mentation of Mr. Delano, former Com missioner, in his last report t) Congress, : that the tax on prepaid mustard, sauces, sirup*, jams and jellies, be abolished. Also, that authority be given the Commissioner to furnish stamps to be placed on condemned, for e ted and abandoned tobacco held by officers, and so depreciated as not to >-ell for enough to pty charges, to be attached and can- 1 celled be'ore being offered tor sale. The tobicco referred to was manufactured under the old Ihw, and is unstamped, at d the officers holding it cannot, under the >ew law, offer it lor eale without first being etamp-d, and there is no present provision of law under which the Commi-sioner can furnish the stumps to the officer* to stamp it, The Commissioner also a-k-t lor au thority to furnish etimp^ f ?r re.-Umping ! tax-pa J packages of spirita, where, by unavoidable accident and without fault on the part of the persons interested, the oiiginal sUmpa have been lost. Concerning tiie authority to refund taxes erroneously collcct*?d, the Commissioner rec-yn mends that such authority l?e re stricted by legislative enactment tocases | where ilie claim is presented within two years from the time the tax was paid, and that all claims be barred in the courts a^ter six years from the date of the payment of the tax. The complaint which has heretofore exated ol delay in the Settlement of ex ollect^rs accounts has been, it is believed, entirely removed by the operation of the regulations of this oflice now in force. Prior to April, 1870, it appeared that the accounts of sixty-one ex collectors had been closed, which number, how ever, has since be -n increased to four hundred and thirty-four, leaving Ht the present time two hundred and thirty accounts still open. Of this number oue hundred and fifteen have been placed in the hands of the United States nt ornevs lor suit on the bonds of the delinquent collectors, the re-idue being in course of adjustment. Report of the NiTH'inrj of the lit. torlor. The policy of the government in tin conduct of Indian affair* for the p<*t-t two years lias be^n productive of grati fying result*. The services of t he u n pa;d board of Indian Commissioner* liHve a's') exercised a wholesome influ ence in establishing the new polit y, the most notable effects o' which thus far have been 10 eiippre?-* Indian wars and deprecations, to unite tribes uj?on designated re*erv.u:or)s, and to improve them in agriculture and other indus tries. The success which has attended the policy offers reason 10 hope for the gradual social elevation and Chris'.ian ization of the race. During the y?ar, the various tribe* have raised a^ricul tural product* to the value of more than eight millions of dollars, not in cluding the products of the Cherokee*, from whom 11G report has been received, but whose products last year were value 1 at over two and one halt million dollar*; being an aggregate of about ten millions of dollars' worth of farm pro luce. There are two hun dred and sixteen school* a~iOng the Ind an tribes, with three hundred and twentv three teachers, and an avt*ra:e of 8920 pupil". Some progress is also being made towards inducing the more troublesome and r.onalic tribes in Arizona, New M ??xico and on the west em b irders of Texas to accept and en ter up ?n reservations, and there is rea sonable ground to hope that it w II eventually he accomplished. For this purpose it is ot importance that increas ed and liberal appropriations for food, clothing and (arming implements be made by Congress. The establishment of a compulsory system of education, to such an extent as to withhold annuities from tho^e who re'u-e or neglect to avail them-elves of the educational 'a cilities offered, is a'so recommended, wliilethe encouragement of agriculture by the payment of premiums 'or the best cultivated farms is sug:e?ted a? a further means of their advancement. The Indian population now under the juris diction of the United States is about 321,000, including the estimated popu lation of Alaska Ex :luding these, and 3063 scittere i throughout the 8 ?uthern .Stat?s, n?t maintaining tribal relations, the remainder are loutedon reserva tions fnbrac ng an a. '/re gate of 228.473 square miles, or 137,846 971 acres. It im recommended that this Indian popu lation be ga'hered into a smaller area, the Indian territory, south of Kan?as and west of Missouri anl Arkansas, bein^ sugges'.el; a step which would release marly a hundred millions o' acres fro n Indian occupancy, and throw it open to white settlement and cultivation, besides having a tendency to obliterate many of the existing ob stacles to Indian civilization The custom of holding all properly in common, which is always atix upon industry, and a premium upon indolence and unthrift, would be abolished. Frequent changes of reservations, the source of so many of our troubles with that ract in the past, would cease. The rewards of industry would be so liberal as to obliterate their long standing prejudice against labor, while the lark of opportun:ty to do a way with the drS-re to engage in those diversions, sod tho*e who were not convinced of the propriety of industry would sx>n be compelled to recognze its necs?tty The aggression oi white settlers on Indian re-ervat ons are denounced, and the complaint of a number of tribe" that tbesurvevs of the railroads author ized to be built through the Indian country deprive them of nearly all the reliable gr?z ng and farming lands in ' their supposed re?* rvations, are recom- , mended to the attention of Coogreas, since they render the Indians uneasy as to the tenure of their lands, bringing the good faith of the Government into ! doubt, aid retarding the working of the pacific polic^. Mr. Colyer's mi?*ioo to Cochise, the Apache chief, is described as having had a good influence. En coo raging progress toward in fuc ng the Apache* to enter upon the designated reservations has been maie. Instruc 1 tions have been given the military ** thorities to co-operate with the officers ^ of the I'd an Bureau, sod to advise the ' Apaches that it they will enter upon the reservation provided for them, in good faith, aod life thereon peaceably, they will receive the aid aod protection of tbn Government, bat if they do sot do 90, and evince any disposition to reoew | their depredations, they will be prompt ly punished. Tbe Indian ageats have al*o been instruced to acquaint the Indians with tbe desizos 01 tbe Gov ernment concerning them. It is recom mended that when reservations cootaia more land than the Indians need, tbe surplm should, with their consent, be sold at fair market rates, and the pro ceeds appl ed to improvements and the establishment o? industrial schools. The number of acres of public land* disposed or during the year in every form amounted to 10,606,79:2,003. Tbe necessity for further legislation in re gard to private land claims in New Mexico. Arizona and Colorado is pointed out; the increased value of land* in these Territories, consequent upon tba extension of railroads, rapidly attract ing settlers, rendering it a matter of great importance to their future pros* parity that the private lands should be separated from the public domain at the earliest possible period, to accomplish which result existing legislation ia inad equate. A complete unification of (he law of settlement rights is desirable, and action by Congress is recommended to secure it. It is also suggested that agricultu* r.\l scrip be by legislation assimilated to military land warrants, to the extent that the same may be receivable in soinmutation of homesteid entries; and recommendation is ma lethatcrcdit be given to soldiers in the Ute war for the full term of service rendered by them in the war, and that tbe same may be deducted from ihe term of years required by law to perfect a ho'weetsad.
