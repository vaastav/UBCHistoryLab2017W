' Washington, Dec. 1C Tlmt tho Sul zer resolution abrogating tho treaty of ,1132 would ho considered nn "Insult In Russia," If onnctcd Into law, was tho substnnco of a message convoyed to 'President Taft today 1y Secretary Knox t ollowlng a eonferem-o be tween' Knox and Russian Ambassador Hnkhmcteff. All diplomatic negotiations looking toward a settlement of tho Jewish passport question, were broken oft ns n result of tho dissatisfaction of Rus sl. over tho action of tho houso of representatives In adopting tho Sulzor icsolutlon. It was Btatcd positively that tho mesEOgo of tho Russian ambassador was not In any way In tho nature of a threat against tho United States. Tho ambassador explained that Itussla did not object to this country abrogat ing tho treaty hut did object to the strong language of tho Sulzer resolu tion which flatly charged Ritssla with bad faith and having violated tho terms or tho treaty. With tho sudden trrmlnaton of tho negotiations being conducted by Ambassador Guild at St. Petersburg, President Taft found himself bereft of tho moms by which lie hoped to forestall direct action by congress. ! TiQ. president this afternoon fium l.uincd Senator .Cullom, Republican, Illinois, chairman of "tho senate com mittee on foreign relations, nnd urg ed hlni to cniiso tho resolution to bo mi amended as to removo the language which Is offonslvo to Hussla. Tljo pres ident held that tho purposo could bo accomplished exactly as well by "a tMi'iperatcly. worded" resolution to which Itussla would II ml no objection. Tho Sul.or resolution roads In part iih follows: "That tho government of tho Uni ted States will not bo party to any ticaty wlilch discriminates (between American citizens on tho ground of raco or religion; that tho government of Itussla has vlolnted tho troaly lo twecu tho United Stntos and Russia, concluded at St. Petersburg December 16, 18.12, refusing to honor American jwissports duly issued to American citizens on account of raco or religion: that In tho Judgmont of tlio congress the sald( treaty for tho roasons aforo biild, ought to ho terminated (it tho curliest possible time." Tho resolution concludes with In mmctloliH to tho prosldent to notify Russia that tho "said treaty Is here by declared to bo terminated." When told by tho United Press that tho Itusslan ambassador had formally protested ngalnst his resolution, Rop lcsotitatlvo Sulzor, chairman of tho houso commlltoo on foreign nffalrs: "I should Hko to havo been In tho p'raco of tho secretary of stato to mnko reply to that protest. I know Vliat I shpuld havo said. 'Thero Is no doubt In my mind that whether Russia protests or not, tho resolution will pass tho senator" Minority Lender Mann, Ilopubllcan. Illinois, who opposed tho wording of tlio resolution on tho floor of tho houso becauso of tho direct chargo of violation made, ngalnst Itussla, was ln cllnod to say: "I told you so," when lu heard of tho latest developments (in tho enso, Mann, In tho Iioupo, said: "If tho resolution passes nnd tho troaty Is abrogated and Hussla so chooses, sho may shut out all Amer ican cltlaons. If wo say wo uro deter mined that American citizens shall go Into UBsIa wp can only forco that demand by conquering at tho end of a war." It hecamo known that tho Russian ambassador asked yesterday for a. conferonco, and that ho mot Prcsldont 'faft and Secretary Knox last ovonlng. Later Cecrotary Knox lw'd a further conferonco with tho Ambassador wlta tho result that ho took tho final mes wififo from Itussla to tho president to day. It was said at tho oxccutlvo olllces ru tho Wlilto Houso this nl'tornoon that th.e entire sltuiitlon had been placed 1 leforo tho senate :ommttteo on for eign rolatloiiB, and that It was up to the soiiate to act. Though np direct statement was mndo as to tho wording of tho pro test niPdo by tho Itusslan ambassador It Is wild that ho mado tho fact very clear that Itussla considered tho word ing of tho'Sulzor resolution gratui tous and unnocopsary.
