Mr. Clevelandsent in hie Message on the 6th, the day lor the opening of Con gress, and we give our readers a brief ? Bynope?s of this busrae?s-Kke document We ifipr ftom;tbe New York Sun ? In method and spirit, and especially in its careful study of the department.) reports, on which it is largely based,, Mr.^velandVseeonl ge nera? message*! resembles the one sent to Congress a year ago. review or roierastjonat affairs^ Here the two great subjects of importance are the fishery disfatte and the Gotting case. The former is still unsettled, and the President, while desiring friendly rela tions with the dominion, finds such re lationsylJw*atened; by the action of it* officials toward our fishermen. He ; makes no mention of the authority given to him last summer to check this action by ? retaliatory proclamation. The year's negotiations at London have thus far resulted in nothing, but hopes are heldxOttt of reaching an acceptable con clusion before the end of the session. Meanwhile the correspondence on the subject Is to be laid before Congress. As to the Cutting ease, the President contenta himself with protesting against the Restri?e that although Mr. Cutting's offence was committed on our -soil, yet he became subject to punishment by Mexican laws, when found in that coun try, as the offence had been committed agi?nst^^f?x???i citizen. f?e "b?pe* that Mexico will abandon' her positron; because the two republics should be good friends, and American capital and enter prise, 4owing int Mexico, asks , securi ty of person and property. He recom mends legislation, to carry out the Re ciprocity Convention of 1863 with Mexi co, and is going to open negotiations for an enlarged treaty of commerce. ; With Hawaii, as an outpost of Ameri can commerce, our relations, says the President, ought. to bei streng then ed. The treaty? now terminable on a year's notice, ought t? be extended for a fur ther term of seven years, while the au tonomy of the islands should be main tained and telegraph communication established between them and us. The President regrets the ill treat; ment of the Chinese on the Pacific coast, and says that China will meet us half way in limiting the emigration of her subjects, while protecting those who are now iure.r ^oosVrtsuitsjare^i?iped from the recent changes in otgantclaw bringing Panama directly under the ad ministration of Bogota. Chili has not yet provided for the payment of the claims of our countrymen. Liberia the President regards _ as an ^ ?n' en oof^t*ocrr^rrtrea! system, entitled-+o our support in maintaining her inde pendence, although a formal protector ate would be against our policy. He proposes to give her some 'small vessel, no longer found adequate to our needs,' fof /protecting her coastwise revenues. Ce%?u? Greeecbaum bai bee ? recalled for his 'overzealous* stroke in declaring a protectorate over Samoa and King Malie ton. The Netherlands complain that our tariff specially discriminates agamat the tobacco of the Dutch, Sa** Indies. Spain has relinquished her dis-' crimination against our -merchant ves sels in the Antilles, and now displays ? friendly commercial spirit. Mr. Cox will be glad to bear that the improved tre*A**eat-o? American imsaionarrea in Turkey is due to his exertions. Vene zuela still withholds her ratification of the Claims Convention of 18S5. A revision of l?gislation of citizenship and extradition is asked, with a bureau Or the registration of naturalized citi zens, and a law for the .immediate dis charge from custody of persons commit ted for extradition where the President thinks the surrender should not be made. The copyright question is com mended to Congress and also the aboli- j tiooe&tbe discrimination now made by t^e^ariff io favor of the works of 'Ameri-j can artiste. Attention is asked to Secretary Bayard's proposed re-arrange- ! ment of the diplomatic and consular J salaries, and much appreciation is ex- j pressed of the value of the consular re ports which the State Department prints. Turning to financial affairs, the Presi dent says the ordinary receipts of the last fiscal year were $13,749,020.68 above those of the year preceding ; the ordinary expenses, $17,788,797 less ; the surplus left in the Treasury, $93, 956,588.65, as against $63,463,771. 27 the previous year, being an increase of $30,492,817.27. The estimated sur plus at the end of the current expenses ter about $90,000,000. The President urges a reduction of the 3venues by so modifying the tariff as to 'cheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported materi als as by American labor may be manu factured' into marketable goods. The agriculturist, he says, pays 'an unnafar al-profiV which, by the action of the Government, is given to the more favored manufacturer.' As to the com pulsory coinage of silver, the President repeats, bis last year's recommendation of its suspension. He advises the ap pointment of an additional Federal Judge in the Southern District of New xork, where custom suits hare greatly accumulated. Of Secretary Eodieott's recommenda tions he specially sanctions those rela ting to eoast defence, and for requiring examination, like those in the navy, a poo the promotion of army officers. A short summary of Secretary Whit ney*? report is given, with a somewhat guarded approval of its project for secur- i ing ^American armor and gun steel, j Thej^mdes* favors an extension of the tree delivery service, and an appro priation for increased postal services to the Argentine Republic and Brazil, though not as 'a grant or subsidy.' He commends toe suggestions of the Attor ney-General as a whole, and pag?fcu?ar ly the one to establish a peui{?6tiary for prisoners sentenced in Jfnited States ; Coarte. The cost of erecting and main taining it would be partly offset, he says, by saving the sums paid to State institutions, and by 'the manufacture of such articles as were needed for use by the Government.' The President repeats his recommen dation of a commission of three army officers and three civilians, as auxiliary to the present system of Indian* agents. The allotment of Indian lands in several ly is also favored. The ? repeal of the Pre-emption and Timber Culture acts and the repeal or amendment of the Homestead and the Desert Land laws are.; recommended. The scibject of pen sions is discussed at length, but rather vaguely. There seems, however, to be an indication of an important purpose to object to pensions granted 'upon any other gro?ods than actual service and I injury or disease incurred in such ser vice.' TW^aten t Office is busy and prosperous, y As to the Uniion Pacific's indebtedness, the President somewhat diplomatically says that' the matters to consider are 'the situation of the Government se a creditor and the sorest way to secure the payment of the princi pal and interest of its debt.' The pro priety of inter-State commerce legisla tion is suggested cautiously, and the labor question provokes a renewal of the project So add arbitration in labor to the present functions of the Labor Burean. The prevailing cattle disease is recommended to the attention of Con gress. . * Of?he Civil Service law Mr. Cleve land declares that 'every public officer who has a just idea of hie duty to the peop?e^testifies to the value of this re form ;' that should its underlying prin ciple be abandoned, it wiii be the aban donment of 'the surest guarantee of the safety and success of American institu tions and that the salaries of the Com missioners ought to be increased at once. He recommends that the Government shouTffpay to the victims of the Freed man's Savings and Trust Company the 38 per cent, of their deposits never re turned to them. The amount would be about $1,291,718, but be thinks that a large part of it would not be called for. The needs; of the District of Columbia round out the very long message. Mrs. Cleveland and Washing ton Society. 'There is no danger/ saiid a Wash ington lady who recently called upon Mrs. Cleveland when she was re ceiving informally those of her ac quaintances who bad previously met her in a social way, 'of the Presi dent's wife e**er injuring hie political prospects by injudicious remarks. She seems on the spar of the mo ment to say just the right thing in reply to remarks that she could not possibly have. anticipated. I begin to think from the opportunities I have bad of observing ladies in pub lic -^-positions daring over twenty years' residence in Washington that, like the poets, Presidents' wives are born not made, and Mrs. Cleveland cer I ?ainly was endowed by nature with I the qualities of mind and heart which would best f?t her for the place she now fiirs so graa-?fcy.

Cleveland receives with a unaffected cordiality that puts her visitors at ease at once. She both talks well and listens well, and manifeste interest in all that is said t? ber, as well as readiness in begin ning a conversation. She seems ab solutely unconscious of the fact that she is ^the first lady of the land,' doing the honors of the residence of its' Chief Magistrate. When some one said to lier that she need not be afraid of -people whom she would not care -to meet* intruding when she was receiving informerly in the evenings, - because those who would Ik*embarrassed by sitting down for a tete-a-tete with the mistress of the White House would rather come on some more public occasion, when they would be lost in the crowd and any deficiencies in their dress or conversation would eecape notice, Mrs Cleveland said promptly and with evident sincerity : do not know who the people are that I iwould not care to meet.' I don't object to meeting any one, but only to havHig a crowd come w?:en I am receiving in the evenings, as might be the .case if they thought 1 was having a formal evening reception for the public.' A Congressman said on hearing this : 'Mrs. Logan herself could not improve on that speech for its ready tact." Mrs. Cleveland sees her visitors in the Red Parlor. While waiting for her they are shown into the Blue Room, and ir. a very few minutes she comes to them, walking with the buoyancy natural to her yonth, and invites thorn to go into the Red Room, as that is less a chamber for occasions of state than tiie other. When passing through the doorway Mrs. Cleveland always steps back for her visitors to precede her. and when one of them recently, a lady much older titan herself but unmarried, said to her at the door, Oh, Mrs. Cleve land, you must go first ; the married ladies always take precedence of un married ones/ ehe said, in a merry tone : 'Is that so ? Then we will go together/ and so walked by the other ; lady's side. As soon as she enters the Red Parlor she asks her visitors to be seated and, when they are, her self draws a chair neat to ?ern and takes her seat.

It was fastened at the throat with a diamond crescent, atid she wore a bouquet de corsage of natural roses. She had on no gloves, and her hands were bare ama arms exposed nearly to the elbow. Her skin is very fair, and her arms and hands are very white ; but, while round, her arms give proof by their sii ape and size of more muscular strength in them than one would ex pect from a lady whose duties had never required her to use them much in a way to develop the muscles. She seems to avoid wearing earrings whenever possible, but had on seve ral handsome finger rings on the ! occasion noted, one gold bangle on her arm, and no other jewelry except the diamond crescent at her throat. !
