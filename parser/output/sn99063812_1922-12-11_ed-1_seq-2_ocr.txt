It Ii well wortti more limn tlio cursory reaillnc that Iho writer lias so far been able to kIvo It. It Is worth the. close attention and study of very cltlicn. It takes ui. and calls for action upon, half a doten vital questions. If (tieso problems vera seltlHl, and stilled rUht. America, and, the roflil, would bo nearer harmony nrTd peae0 by a Reed many steps than thry are today. Kor It Amor lea'bad her own houso In order and could brluR to bear upon world p'tobloros a united purpose, sho could wluld a tremendous Influ ence. Ilut until our own crave domestic concerns aro arranged to general satisfaction, wo cannot ex pect to exert much Influence, nor should wo, upon too affairs of our neighbors. First of all, and It Is so pointed to by President Harding, comes the weal of thfl farmers, who aro now In a bad "ay tho nation over. The Imrocdlhto romedy advocated by the president Is enlarged and longer term credit through extended farm loan bureau powers. ' But the farmer cannot bo made permanently prosperous through en larged borrowings, says tho na tldn'a exocutlve and his words show a wisdom bospeaklng study and understanding that show htm to, be a broader and bigger man titan the majority have yet given bin') credit for being, even among his own party, tThe farmer must be glvon an earning power lu proportion to the Importance of his Industry, so that jjfli'can pay back uhut bo Is forced to. borrow. He must be released from the handicap of Inadequate transportation. wit takes courago to stand up and tell tho transportation magnates that their systems arc broken down, litclr rolling stock worn and In adequate, In the faco of their fran tic dcclarntlcns that everything Is all rlicbt. Harding. In seeking Jus tice for tliu unorganised tillers of tbu soil, Is criticizing a strongly intrenched and organized Interest., .'.It Is not what one would cxpoct fr'otn a politician. It marks more a statesmanlike understanding of tho necessities; without regard for 1m jfbfitlcal effect upon a second term. The Immigration question, Amer icaniiatlon and th" need of a child labor amendment aro all big prob lem's, and are so treated in tho message, but transportation that will actually aid tho producers, and udeqnsto enforcement of tho pro hibition law aro the Imminent prob lems, and nro thus recognized by tiuiy president. ';All good cltlzons will agrco with their president that Is humiliating to sea tho law of tho land flouted, us It U dally being flouted by men and women of high station, as well as tho degraded and criminal, alike III', tho hamlet and the metropolis all over the land. The contempt shown for this one law Is sapping the general respect for all law. Out of the conferenco of gov ernors of tho states with the fed Ml' executive and his advisers, which Is proposed by the president, should come some suggestions. Cer tainly If tho majority of public opinion In the United States favors strict prohibition, there, should be ri difficulty In enforcing the vr against a criminal minority. Iiut If yjm have madu an emotional mis tte, and mlsguagod our real dos- IMM, the honest thing to do Is to admit the truth, repeal tho law, or roodlfy,ilt, and Indulgo our alcoholic cravings openly. V aro in serious danger, Is Pre sent conditions piovall, of becom ing olthor a nation of defiant law breakers, or a national of hypo crites neither of which conforms with' the American Ideal.
