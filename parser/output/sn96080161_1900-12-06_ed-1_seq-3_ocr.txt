4r W The Conservative * 3 STATE INSTITU- TIONS. casions SERVATIVB has urged the practicability of taking oar state institutions out of poli tics and placing them under the control of a state board and , to accomplish this , advocated the enactment of the neces sary legislation at the next session of the legislature. It is gratifying to note that this suggestion is being favorably re ceived by the press of the state. The many scandals in state institutions dur ing the last year have been an object lesson to a great many people and have convinced them that a business-like and efficient administration is impossible until we have a system that will insure the appointment of honest and capable men as managers or superintendents. By placing the Blind Institute under the control of a state board , removed as far as possible from politics , it would tend to prevent a change of management and teaching force with every political change in the state. As long as the present system of political rewards pre vails it will be impossible to secure good men to manage or assist in state institu tions because of the lack of permanency of the employment. The members elect of the legislature should seriously con sider this question and give us some wholesome legislation along this line. The present treas- AN

SENATOR DAVIS. The late Senator Davis will be long remembered as a notable instance of a man in public life who never stooped to the tricks of the demagogue. He took the position he believed to be right , whether it was "smart politics" or not. This was brought out in his attitude toward the Porto Rioan tariff bill. His advice had been instrumental in in ducing the president to write his "plain duty" message to congress. Later , when the protectionist interests forced the republican party to levy a tariff on Porto Rican products , Senator Davis fought the measure , and was one of the few republican senators who voted against it. Again , a few years ago , during the railroad strike in the North west , Senator Davis sent a long letter tea a labor leader , telling why he could not support a resolution in behalf of the strikers in the senate. It is men of this stamp , with the courage of their con victions , who are most needed in a re public. By the death of Senator Davis the country loses one of the too few public men of great ability and indepen dent character. Kansas City Star.
