r OLUME XXIII. HE DID NO WRONG JUDGE ROOT TALKS OF CHARGES AGAINST HIM. Asserls He Never Profited by Ac tions on the Bench. Savs Decis ion in Harris Case was Good Law. Denirs Leaking in Chehaiis County Division Case. SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 8 — "As God is my judge 1 have never profited one single, solitary cent from any source for any action of mine as a member of the S'upreme court," said former Judge Milo A. Root of the Supreme court today at his home in this city. "Not only have I never' profited in any manner from any of my judicial acts, but I have never j committed any act while a member of the court expecting to profit'by it,' nor have I ever intentionally com mitted any act which appeared to me to be wrong or improper. I have en- j deavored at all times to conduct my-; self with the dignity befitting the; high and honorable office which I oc-j cupied and if I have failed in that effort it has been through mistakes or errors of judgment. "Attorney M. J. Gordon of the Great Northern railway and myself have been close friends for more than a decade. He was elected to the of fice of superior judge of Thurston county'in 1892 at the time I was elected prosecuting attorney of the county. When lie was nominated for the office of supreme judge in 1894, I was a member of the steering committee o' Thurston county which procured . the nomination. "We \ jve friends then and we have been friends ever since and I am convinced that he never at any time intended or anticipated that the private papers belonging to liim and turned over by him to his attorney should be used by them or others inj this effort to humiliate nie and drive me from the supreme court. "1 do not even know what those letters contain nor do I know directly what the charges are that are made against me. 1 have repeatedly asked for permission to see them, but even this has been denied me. "I do not recall the correspondence with Mr. Gordon over the decision in the Harris case, but I might be able to do so if I were permitted to read the letters. The original decision in the case was wrong and not in ac cordance with the decision of the fed eral courts. When this fact was call ed to the attention of the court by the petition for a rehearing the court de cided to reverse it. The reversing decision, whatever may have been its history, is good law and will, I be lieve, be accepted as such by the ablest attorneys of the state. "Had I been corruptly desiring to favor the Great Northern, or had 1 been a tool of Gordon, as is now charged, I could have served them Infinitely better by holding with their contention on the original decision. That decision was against the com pany and was a four-to-three de cision. Had I held with the company on that decision it would have chang ed the majority of the court., giving the decision to the company. "The only suggestion concerning money that ever passed between Gor don and myself was his statement, made to me last summer, that a num ber of Spokane business men and contractors were raising a fund to help certain candidates in the prim ary campaign and that of the fund desired to send |300 to Seattle to be used in my interests. I declined the money and he said he would have It sent to some Seattle friend of mine, lie asked me to suggest a suitable person to whom to send it and I sug gested E. 13. Palmer. I then told Mr. Palmer that it would bo sent him and upon that assurance Mr. Palmer ob ligated himself to certain campaign expenditures in my behalf. Later, as the money did not come, I was urged by Palmer to take the matter up with Gordon and did. I believe I wrote him two letters about it, one of which I have been informed was not signed. I am informed that Gordon never sent the money to Palmer. "As to the alleged 'leak' of inform ation in the Chehali3 county division case, that did not como through me, if any 'leak' there was, and certainly not through me to Palmer. In that case ";.lmer was employed on the «ide which lost the case and had, I ABERDEEN HERALD understand, contracted for a $r>,ooo contingent fee, which he lost by the decision. Annual Meeting of Directors Ar ranges for Coming Season. Portland Takes Place of Butte fc'KAT rLE, Dec. 9.—The largest deal ever consummated in the history of baseball in the Pacific Northwest went on record yesterday afternoon at the annual meeting of the direc tors of the Northwestern League, at the Butler, in this city, when Russ Hall trarsferred the contracts of nine Hutte fdayers to George Shreeder, owner of the Tacoma Tigers. In cluded in the list is Third Baseman Cartwrlght, the man that nearly every club in the league was anxious to secure, and who has been consid ered thoughtfully by such major league teams as Cincinnati, Brook lyn and the Philadelphia Athletics. The five remaining Butte men were transferred to Spokane. W. H. Lucas was unanimously re elected president for one year, and his salary was raised from $2,200 to $2,400. Walter Macfarlane, presi dent of the Aberdeen club, was made j vice president, an office which he ; has held for one year; and Judge jW. W. McCredie, of Portland, was made a director. The elmination of Butte and the unanimous election of Portland to membership necessitated the rejec j tion of the senii-official application ; of Helena for membership. There was ! a sentiment in favor of an eight club league, which have included i Butte and Helena, but after a long discussion it was decided that a six ' club circuit, cutting out the heavy i trans]>ortation charges to Montana, ; would be the best for all concerned. The season will commence in the lat ter part of April, with the following clubs: Portland, Tacoma, Spokane, Aberdeen, Vancouver and Seattle. Thoso pKsent «t the meeting were jas follows: President W. H. Lucas, | Spokane; President Joe Cohan, Spo ikane; Manager Bob Brown, Spokane; i President Walter Macfarlane, Aber deen; President A. R. Dickson, Van jcouver; A. G. Halstead, Vancouver; : President George Shreeder, Tacoma; ! President Russ Hall, Butte, Presi i dent D. E. Dugdale, Seattle. City Election at County Seat Results in Success of the Reform Ticket.

Gribben Cele • brates Forty-Fifth Anniversary of His Ordination. j Rev. Father John Joseph Gribben, ; the aged and revered chaplain of St. i Joseph's hospital, celebrated the i forty-fifth anniversary of bis ordina- J tion as a priest on Tuesday, Decem ber 8, when he was presented with la purse by his numerous friends as a | token of their love and esteem. He | has had a varied career, which began I near Belfast, Ireland, and is reaching • its culmination on the Western slope ]of the United Stales. He is a second | cousin of former Senator W. A. Clark, jot' Montana, at whose palatial Fifth I avenue residence he is always a ' guest on his visits to New York, made about once a year. Born on June 9, 1831, he came with his parents to America in 1848. !at the age of 17. He entered St. | Michael's college, Toronto, Canada, ! and after finishing the course there, took the full course at the Grand Seminary of St. Sulpice, Montreal. After bis ordination, Father Grib i ben came West and endured the hard ' ships incident to a new country. He j has frequently driven forty-five miles I and held mass at 2 o'clock in the af- I ternoon, necessarily maintaining his I fast. Father Gribben has always been a great traveler, and has been able to take many interesting journeys. He says that it is nothing for him to de cide to pack his grip and take a trip abroad. He has crossed the Atlantic ocean fifty-four times, and has been twelve times around the Mediterr anean sea. He has visited his holi ness, the pope at Rome, and there is not an important city in the United States which he has not seen at some time. SCHOOL HOUSE BURNED. The School House at South Aberdeen Is Totally Destroyed by Fire, Monday Night. The school house in South Aber deen was discovered in flames about 7:30 Monday evening, and, owing to the distance from fire headquarters, was totally destroyed, together with the contents, except a few booka and desks that were saved. Owing to the bad condition of the streets, the fire apparatus was slow in reaching the fire, and the chem ical wagon got a severe shaking up. It was necessary to lay 1,100 feet of hose to reach the burning building, and by the time this was done the structure was beyond saving. The building cost about $3,000 two years ago, and was insured for $2,000, and there was $200 insurance on the con tents. While this fire was in progress a false alarm was sent in from the box at the Wilson mill, and the big fire engine started for that point. In going at a rapid pace on East Heron street, a wheel sank into a hole, nearly throwing the men from the engine, and seriously damaging the machine. WILL IMPROVE MILL. The Burrows Lumber Company Will Add Improvements That Will Increase Capacity One-Third. The Burrows Lumber company has anonunced Its Intention of closing down January 10 for the purpose of making improvements that will cost $45,000, and will increase the capac ity of the mill one-third. They are now refusing orders, so as to be ready to begin the work of recon struction on the date set. Among the improvements planned are two new handsaws, which will increase the output of the mill 50,000 feet every ten hours, giving a dally ca pacity of 150,000 feet. They will also build a steel refuse burner, on a concrete foundation, on the site of the present burner. A large dry kiln will be added to the present equipment, as well as other neces sary improvements. Cosmopolis Election.

The following officers were elected: Mayor, D. P. Speigle. Councllmen, H. P. Thomas, Chas. E. Seaman, Chaa. H. Pry and C. W. Brown. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Hakes Annual Recommen dations to Congress. ATTACKS ANTI-TRUST LAW 2 Sherman Act Should Be Amended to Permit Combinations Which Are In the Interest of the Public, Says the President — Urges Legislation to Safeguard the Wageworkers—Dwells on Need of Protection For Forests. Views on the Army and the Navy. Washington, Dec. B.—ln his message to congress, read to the two houses, the president said: The financial standing of the nation at the present time Is excellent, and the financial management of the na tion's interests by the government dur ing the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. Hut our currency system is imperfect, and it is earnestly to be hoped that the cur rency commission will be able to pro pose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to Sept. 30, 1008, there has been a net surplus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduc tion of the Interest bearing debt by ninety millions, In spite of the extraor dinary expense of the Panama canal and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual Interest charge. This is an exceedingly satisfactory showing. There has been a reduction of taxa tion. Corporations. As regards the great corporations en gaged In interstate business, and espe cially the railroads, I can only repeat what I have already again and again said in my messages to the congress. I believe that under the Interstate clause of the constitution the United States has complete and paramount right to control all agencies of Inter state commerce, and I believe that the national government alone can exer cise this right with wisdom and ef fectiveness so as both to secure Justice from nnd to do Justice to the great corporations which arc the most Im portant factors In modern business. I believe that It Is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit .ill combinations, us Is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, because such a law can be en orce.i only Imperfectly and unequal and Its enforcement works almost is much hardship as good. 1 strongly advocate that instead of an unwise vj'oi t to all combinations there ■ilia II be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are In the Interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some agency of the national government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire publicity in nil matters which the pub lic has a right to know and, further more, the power, not by Judicial, but by executive, action to prevent or put a stop to every form of Improper fa voritism or other wrongdoing. The railways of the country should be put completely under the Interstate commerce commission and removed 

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT. from the domain of the anti-trust Jaw. The power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision aud control over the Issue of securities ns well as over the raising and lower ing of rates. As regards rates, at least this power should be summary. Pow er to make combinations and traffic agreements should be explicitly con ferred upon the railroads, the perrnls | sion of the commission being first ! gained and the combination or agree ment being published in all Its de tails. The Interests of the sharehold ers, of the employees nnd of the ship pers should all be guarded as against one another. To give any one of them undue aud Improper consideration Is to do injustice to the others. Kates must be made as tow as is compatible I with giving proper returns to all the 'employees of the railroad, from the highest to the lowest, and proper re turns to the shareholders, but thefr must not, for instance, be reduced In such fashion as to necessitate a cut In the wages of the employees or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders. Telegraph and telephone companies engaged in Interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the in terstate commerce commission. Ample Reward* For Intelligence. It is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon individual initiative and individual ca pacity and an ample reward for the great directing intelligences alone com petent to manage the great business operations of today. It is well to keep In mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the reactionary the worst enemy of order so the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, and the men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from tho demagogues who In the name of popu lar rights would do wrong to and op press honest business men, honest men of wealth, for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily Invites a violent reaction against the cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. The opposition to government con trol of these great corporations makes Its most effective effort In the shape >f an appeal to the old doctrine of states' rights. The proposal to make the national government supreme over, and there fore to give it complete control over, the railroads and other Instruments of Interstate commerce is merely a pro posal to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose, for which the constitution was founded. It does not represent centralization. I believe that the more faralghted corporations are themselves coming to recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayed during the last few years to regulation and control by the national government of combinations engaged in Interstate busi ness. There are many matters affecting la bor and the status of the wageworker to which I should like to draw your attention. As far as possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the ad vantages conferred by machinery, or ganization and division of labor, ac companied by an effort to bring about a larger share In the ownership by wageworker of railway, mill and fac tory. In farming this simply means that we wish to see the farmer own his own land. We do not wish to see the farms so large that they become the property of absentee landlords who fena them by tenants nor jet so ■mall Labor. 

NUMBER 27 that the farmer becomes like a Euro pean peasant. j The depositors lii our savings banks now number over one-tenth of our en tire population. These are all capital ists who .through the savings banks ; loan their money to the workers—that j Is, lu many cases to themselves—to carry on their various Industries. Postal savings banks will make It easy | for the poorest to keep their savings In absolute safety. The regulation of i the national highways must be such . that they shall serve all people with equal Justice. Corporate finances must l>e supervised so as to make It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money In' stocks. There must be prohibition of, child labor, diminution of woman la bor, shortening of hours of all me chanical labor. Stock watering should lie prohibited, and stock gambling, so far as fs possible, discouraged. There should be a progressive Inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial edu cation should be encouraged. Protection For Wageworkerfc I There 1s one matter with which the congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any palter ing with the question of taking care of the wageworkers who, under our present industrial system, become kill ed, crippled or worn out as part of the regular Incidents of n given business. The object sought for could be achiev ed to a measurable degree, ns far.a? those killed or crippled are concerned, by proper employers' liability laws. "As far as concerns those who have been worn out, I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward pro viding old age pensions have been taken in many of our private indus tries. Tending a thoroughgoing investiga tion and action there Is certain legis lation which should be enacted at once. The law passed at the last ses sion of the congress granting com pensation to certain classes of em ployees of the government should be extended to include all employees of the government and should be made more liberal in Its terms. In this re spect the generosity of the United States toward Its employees compares most unfavorably with that of every country In Europe—even the poorest, i The terms of the act are also a hardship' In prohibiting payment in cases where the accident Is in any way due to the negligence of the em ployee. It Is inevitable that dally fa miliarity with danger will lead men to take chances that can be construed into negligence. ! I renew my recommendation made , In a previous message that half holi days be granted during the summer to all wageworkers in government em ploy. I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entire work being carried on by the govern ment The Court*. I most earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of Increasing the totally I Inadequate salaries now given to our judges. On the whole, there is no body of public servants who do as valuable work nor whose moneyed reward is so Inadequate compared to i their work. Beginning with the su preme court, the Judges should have their salaries doubled. It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for do ing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration of 1 Justice and which operate with pecul | lar severity against persons of small ! means and favor only the very crimi nals whom it is most desirable to pun ish. At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent and sweeping attack upon the entire Ju diciary of the country, an attack couched in such terms as to include the most upright, honest and broad minded Judges no less than those of narrower mind and more restricted outlook. Last year before the house committee on the Judiciary these same labor leaders formulated their de mands, specifying the bill that con tained them, refusing all compromise, stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They insisted on a provision that In a labor dispute no Injunction should issue except to pro tect a prooertv rUrht and specifically provided that the right to carry on business should not be construed aa a property right, and in a second pro vision their bill made, legnl lu a labor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons that would not-have been unlawful If done by a single person. In other words, this bill legalized blacklisting and boy-, cottlng in every form. The demand; was made that there should be trial by Jury in contempt cases, thereby most seriously impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented a course of policy which, if carried out, would mean the enthronement of class privilege In Its crudest and most brutal form and the destruction of one of the most essential functions of the Judiciary in all civilized lands. The wageworlcers, the worlclngmen, the laboring men of the country, by the waj In which the/ repudiated the ftf-
