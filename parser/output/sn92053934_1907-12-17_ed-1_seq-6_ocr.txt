"Well, the United States shows signs of be coming a civilized nation, according to that standard. Postmaster General George von Lengerke Meyer In his an nual report to the president strongly recommends the establishment of such an Institution. President Roosevelt In his annual message to congress sec onds the motion. But a still stronger recommendation made by Mr. Meyer and seconded by Mr. Roosevelt Is that a system of postal savings banks be instituted. The new postmaster gen eral, who was des-tiled in some quar ters when he took office last March as "a society fop," seems to be trying to get things done. While the postal sav ings bank system and the parcels post are by no means new notions, no pre vious postmaster general has urged them with such emphasis. The recommendation for postal sav ings banks comes in what might be called the nick of time. The financial stringency, otherwise the lack of cold cash in circulation, is due in large measure to the hoarding of money by persons "who are afraid to trust it to the banks. Mr. Bryan's proposition to have the national government guaran tee the safety of bank deposits as a preventive of hoarding Is really: though perhaps unconsciously, reiter ated by Mr. Meyer in bis recommenda tion that the people be- permitted to i deposit their money in postoflices. The country to Europe for safe keeping by suspicions immigrants would stay here in general circulation. There are in round numbers 30,000 money order postoflices. with about 23.000 others. The suggestlan of the chief, of the department is that all money order offices be made places of deposit, with such other offices as may be designated, according to the local conditions. Practically everybody Is in touch with a money order postoflioe. The temptation to hand spare cash to the postmaster would make savers out of millions of persons who at preseut never save a solitary ducat. Thus, In addition to transforming the useless secret hoard Into a career of usefulness in the channels of trade, the postal savings system might transform mil lions of Impecunious persons into thrifty citizens. Opposed by Powerful Interests. But the postmaster general's recom mendation for an extension of the par cels post service is reasonably sure to find itself confronted by a wall of op position built of re-ruforeed adamant. That has been the experience of the past. Postmaster Generals Vilas, Wanainaker and Bissell each urged this extension. In each instance the proposition ran up against a blank wall in congress and fell down. There are two widely different interests, each powerful in Its way. which oppose the carrying of packages by the postal service above the present maximum weight of four pounds. The great ex press companies constitute one inter est. They are well aware that In Eu- yenrs. A cinm tt it operate ir. i-riucipje adopt ed by V. S. Army.

The merchants do not love the express companies, nor do the common people adore the mail order magnates. But this peculiar situation makes strange bedfellows. There is one recommendation in the postmaster general's report which all of us, particularly in the cities, will approve. Mr. Meyer suggests that slot machines be installed at points of pub lic access for the automatic selling of stamps and postal cards. Anybody can appreciate the advantage of stamp slots who has wanted a postage stamp and wanted it badly, but. being miles from the postoffice, has been compelled to brave the scornful drug clerk lion In his den and timidly. request that he sell a two cent stamp at the govern ment price. Postmaster General Meyer, whose recommendations have set people to thinking and talking, is a unique fig ure in the cabinet. He .was born on Beacon mil. Boston, In 1S58, with a whole 6et of 'golden spoons in his mouth. Ever since then he has been adding to his family plate in other words, getting richer. He is one of the wealthiest men who ever sat at the cabinet table, though great wealth is not new to the president's departmen tal advisory group. There was Wana maker. President Harrison's postmas ter general, and there was Whitney, President Cleveland's first secretary of the navy, to name two multimillion aire cabinet officers. Excellent Presiding Officer. Mr. Meyer was graduated from Har vard in 1879, just a year before Theo dore Roosevelt received, his diploma from the same institution. Mr. Meyer went into business. With his family backing and prestige, not forgetting the accompanying cash, his way was easy. As a merchant and as managing director in a dozen big concerns Mr. Meyer pursued a flowery path. He married a charming woman. Miss Alice Appleton. was a brilliant figure in Boston society and might easily have become a Newport "exquisite." giving monkey dinners and cutting other monkey shines, but he didn't He was different. Early in his twen ties he got himself elected a Boston alderman. Then he was called higher and became a member of the Massa chusetts legislature for several terms. In 1S04 the youug legislator was elect ed speaker of the house. He made an excellent record as a presiding officer. It is said of him that he expedited business with unusual ability and tact. After his long service in city and state legislative bodies Mr. Meyer was selected by President McKinley in 1900 to go to Italy as ambassador. His wealth and his wide experience in so cial functions among the upper ten rendered him uncommonly fit to hold his own and 'maintain Uncle Sam's dignity in the company of kings and This beautiful Ilasc BurmV 1? viaT lft-lfl, t?.,;jyvftKjBr'f nU-kcl nlatcd and euaranteed the very when one !ws not II 1854 I mo Mnor FOR

It Is believed also that millions and mil lions of dollars, now sent out of this ropean countries under the parcels post pystetns operated there packages are carried at about one-fourth the price exacted by the American express con cerns for the same weight and dis tance. Consequently they have fought this proposed innovation tooth and toe nafl. With Thomas C. Piatt of New York, president of the United States Express company. In the national sen ate, the parcels post has had one in veterate enemy in a high place for many years. The other opposing interest Is one which is stronger today than, ever and constantly growing still stronger. The retail merchants of the smaller cities and towns are dead set against the parcels post. They are just as en thusiastic In opposition as are' the big city mall order houses In advocacy of it. The retailers hold that with pack ages up to twelve pounds carried through the malls at a nominal rate the mail order people will greatly in jure the local retail trade.. Already, without a general parcels post, local merchants have suffered greatly be cause of raajl orders delivered by ex press. Wlthtli.e malls open both to the order and to"Hhe delivery of the gooas ana witn rural delivery routes being extended day by day, the mer chants in small towns fear that disas ter would overtake theif business, v- Peculiar.

" Q1 during this wile at v1.Oj.S2 large "t of extra line CharmiTfuarra" Tvutai7 When the president made several changes in his cabinet last March be called Ambassador Meyer to assume the portfolio of postmaster general. The Meyers, it was said by the social exquisites at Washington, would make most welcome additions to the society of the national capital. Their wide experience not only in Boston's Back Bay district, but in the circles where kings, queens and princelings move, would lend "distinction" to the cab inet circle, all of which has turned out to be true. The Meyer ladies are charming and popular. European court experience Is by no means to be sneez ed at In our democratic Washington, for the families of foreign diplomats may be inclined to prefer the near European to the all American brand of social etiquette. As to the head of the Meyer house hold, these stories of his wealth and his family's -social training were not conducive to the solidification of bis reputation with the masses. In fact, there appeared to be a set purpose on the part of some Washington corre spondents to deny to Mr. Meyer the place of honor at the head of his de partment and to make Frank Hitch cock, the first assistant, postmaster general by brevet. It was said that Hitchcock did the work and Meyer drew the honors. Postmaster General Meyer now seems to have gained his bearings in the postoffice department and to have become the pilot of the ship. The lo cal postoffice Is the average citizen's most intimate bond of acquaintance with the national government. To the most of s a proposed change, for bet ter or for worse, in the postoffice de partment 'is a matter of personal In terest.

S.'s Market Value. - , George Bernard Shaw, writing in the London New Age, says: "Milton took 5 for 'Paradise Lost' because he could not get any more. I should ask 5,000 for the same quantity of pen and ink work because -1 need not take any less.'- " . ' One of the things that Illinois farm ers know the least about In definite terms is auy carefully considered method for determining the item of cost in the production of any crop, yet as In any other business, an accurate knowledge of such cost is very neces sary to. economic production and safe ty and success in the undertaking. Joseph R. Fulkerson of Hazel Dell stock farm, Jersey ville, 111., has figur ed out for three different years the cost of producing an acre of corn, and he told about it as follows in address ing the Grout farm encampment, near Winchester: It is not always the man who knows the most who makes the greatest suc cess, but the man who thinks. It is necessary to read, and as a rule the one who reads the most thinks the most. The day of haphazard farming by plenty of brawn and no brains has gone by. No two farms are exactly alike. Every farm is a separate and distinct problem to be worked out by Itself. So much depencs upon the man. Knm Kvrrjr Item of Cont. A man said the other day. "Lumber is high," but a lumber dealer replied that lumber had been too low and now simply had advanced along with pork, corn and wheat. He was able to tell to a penny the cost of the timber, the labor, and the freight rates; what it cost him to haul and skid the logs, to put them over the saw, to stack and load the. lumber, and to deliver it to the market, and what per cent of culls had to be reconed upon. That was a man who thinks. He Knew exactly what it costs to produce the lumber he was seinng. I wonder if a boy here knows what it cost per acre for seed corn last year; what It cost to plow the ground, to work It down, to' cultivate it, and what, from a previous record, will be the probable cost to husk and deliver this corn. It is necessary that the farmer keep accounts and know the cost of production, that he may be able to figure out methods of cheaper pro duction. The man who finds that there is "no' money in farming" and says "I'm going to quit," doesn't think,, or he doesn't keep accounts. Fladlns (h Coat Per Day. We will first study what a man and team are worth per day. There are four Sundays in a month and proba bly two other days on which the man to figure out the cost of a horse's work. I found that the average price ol farm horses was $125. and figured that they were good for 1" years' work, and worth $30 when 15 years old. You know what com. oats and hay you feed the horses. I gave them the usual amount of hay and then took it out of the mangers and weighed it. A certain amount must be counted for the horses' feed in the stalk-field or pasture. In Massachu setts or Pennsylvania the cost of the horse is figured at, 40 to 50 cents a day. Here the horse costs about one half that, as horses, feed and pasture are cheaper. The horse includes the use of the harness and the repair bills. I found . that it cast 22 cents a day to keep a horse, and figured the man at $1.35 $1.S0 per day for man and team. That is the cost to us. It may cost more or less upon other farms and under other conditions. It is almost impossible to get the exact cost but if we make an effort to do so we will soon come a great deal nearer to it than by guessing. By running over the work book at the end of the season,, we can easily get the number of days spent in work ing each field, and with the price per man and per horse, can figure the cost of the crop leaf Whit tier toilay was marked by commemorative observances in many schools and literary societies in many sections of the country.
