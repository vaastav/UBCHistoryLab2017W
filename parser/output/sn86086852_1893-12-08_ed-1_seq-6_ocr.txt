Tariff Reform Is Again Urged—An Income Tax Favored—A Modifica tion of tiie Bond Law Reeom mended Economy in All Lines Advised Mr. Cleveland Denounces Free Seed Distribution—The Brazilian Revolu tion, Chinese Exclusion Act and a Score of Other Matters Officially Considered. Washington, Dec. 4 —The following Ik the message of President Cleveland us transmitted to congress: To the congress of the United Stales; The constitutional duty which require* the president from lime to lime to give to the con gress information of the slate of the union, an i recommend to their consideration such meas ures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. Is fittingly entered upon by commendin’/ to the congress a careful examination of the detailed Statements and well supported recommenda tions contained in the reports of the heads of departments, who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government In an ef fort to abridge this communication as much as 1* consistent with t*s purpose, I shall supple ment a brief reference to the contents of these departmental reisirts by the mention of such Executive business and incidents as are not tm braced therein, and by such recotmnenda ions as appear to be at this particular time Appropriate. Peaceful Foreign Relations. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situations remain that will not yield to the spirit of fair ness and love of justice, which, joined with con sistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy. Argentine and Brazil Boundary Question. My predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the long standing missions bound ary dispute, tendered to the president of the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those states to lay before me evidence and arguments in behalf of their re apixtive governments. 'The Brazilian Insurrection. 'lii'' outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found Ihe United .States alert to watch ilie interests of our citizens in trial country, with which we carry on Important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy an now and fur some time have been stationed hi Kio Ue Janeiro. The struggle being between tin established government, which controls the machinery of administration, and with which ■we maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as ii does, the elements of di vlded administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recog nition an belligerents. Thus far the position of our government has been that of an attentive bui impartial observer of the unfortunate con flict Emphasizing our fixed policy of impar tial neutrality in such a condition of affairs as now exists, I deemed It necessary to disavow In a manner not to be misunderstood the un authorized action of our late naval commander in those waters in saluting the revolted Brazil ian admiral, being indisposed to countenance Hii act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to Hi-' local Insurrection. Chilian Claim Question. The convention between our government and Chili, hazing fur Its object ihe settlement and adjust ii. nt of the demands of the tw o countries against--ach other, lias been made effective by the organization of the claims commission pro vided ;or The two governments failing to agree upon the third member of the commission, ’-he good offices of the president of the Swiss -epublic were invoked, as provided in the treaty, and the selection of the Swiss repre sentative in Ibis country to complete the organ ization was gratifying alike to the United States ami Chili. The vexatious question of so called legation asylum for offenders against the State and Us laws was presented anew in Ihlli by the unauthorized action of the late tailed States minister in receiving into his of- Cia! residence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges wore pending growing out of a former abortive disturbance. Tin doctrine of asylum as applied to this case |s not sanctioned by the best precedents, and. When allowed, lends to encourage sedition ami Strife. Under no circumstances cun the repre sentatives of this government bo permitted, under the ill-defined fiction of extra territorial ity, to interrupt the administration of criminal lust ice in the countries to which they are ac credited A temperate demand having been made by the Chilian government for thecr.Tac tion of this conduct In the instance mcnVaned, ihe minister was instructed no longer o har bor t’-e offenders. Chinese Registration. The legislation of last year, k’ own as the Geary law. requiring the regGiration of all Chinese laborers entitled to esidence in the United Slates, and the depuration of all not Complying with the provisions of the act within the time proscribed, met wi.h much opposition ■from Chinamen In this eoi itry. Acting upon Jbe advice of eminent coe.isel that the law was unconstitutional, the p eat mass of Chinese laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to its val idity. in good faith declined to apply for the certificates required by its provisions. A test case upon pro ceding by habeas corpus was brought before the supreme court, ami on May 15, 1893, a dec siuU was made by that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed that under the recent amendment of the act extending tire time for registration the Chi nese laborers thereto entitled who desire to re side m this country will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded of estab lishing by lawful procedure their right to re main. and that thereby the necessity of en forced depur ation may to a great degree be avoided, The Murder of 51 tsstonurles in China. Il has devolved upon the United States min ister at r-ain. as dean of the diplomatic body and iu the absence of a representative of Sweden :\:i 1 Norway, to press upon the Chinese Sovernmeni reparation for the recent murder <if ‘Swedish missionaries at Sung-Pu. This Question is of vital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary work In the Interior. The Slave Trade In Africa. By article 12 of the general act of Brussels, signed July 2, 1890, for the suppression of the Have trade and the restriction of certain In jurious commerce in the independent slate of the Congo, and In the adjacent zone of Central Africa, the United States and the other signa tory pow ers agreed to adopt appropriate means for the punishment of persons selling arms and Ammunition to the natives and for the confisca tion of the inhibited articles. It being Ihe plain duty of this government to aid in suppressing the nefarious traffic, im- f (airing as; it does the praiseworthy and civ lizing efforts now in progress in that region I recommend that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms and intoxicants to the natives In ;he regulated zone by our citizens. Extradition Treaties. Costa Kica has lately testified its friendli ness by surrendering to the United Stales, la the absence of a convention of extradition, but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice. It is trusted that the negotiation of a treaty with that country to meet recurring cases of this kind will soon be accomplished In my opinion treaties for reciprocal extradition should be concluded w ith all those countries with which the United States has not already conventional arrange ments of that character. I have deemed it fitting to express to the governments of Costa Rica and Colombia the Kindly desire of the United States to see their pending boundary dispute finally closed bv arbitration in conformity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years ago. The French Republic. Our relations with the French republic con tinue to be intimate and cordial. 1 sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that country, as ameaued by the senate,' will soon be operative. Germany. While occasional questions, affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth, have arisen in our Intercourse with Germany, our relations with that country con t-’uue s;.tii factory. Great Britain. Tho questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress be tween the two governments w ith a view to such concurr nt action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Behring sea tribunal of arbitration practically effective; and u is not doubted that Great Britain will coop rate freely with this country for the accomplishment of that purpose- The dispute growing out of the discriminat ing ions imposed in the Welland canal, upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States, was adjusted by the substitution of a more equitable schedule ot charges, and my prede cessor Thereupon suspended his proclamation imposing discriminating toils upon British transit through our cana.s A request for ud dj Li ops to the list v: • s- raditabtc offenses cor 

IOWA COUNTY DEMOCRAT: MINERAL POINT. WISCONSIN, DECEMBER 8, 1893. ereu by me existing treaty oelw ecu -- - two countries la under consideration. Hayti. During Ihe past year an American citizen em ployed m a subordinate commercial position in Hayti, after suffering a protracted Imprison ment ou an uniouuoect change ot smuggling, finally liberated on judicial examination Upon urgent representation 'o the Haytien Koverum'-ni a suitable indemnity was paid to the sufferer. By a law of Hay ti a sailing vessel having discharged her cargo is refused clear ance unm the duties on such cargo have been paid The hardship of this measure upon American shipowners who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country has been in sisted on with a view of securing the removal of this cause ot cotnjjlalnt. Honduras. Upon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American mail steamer touching at me port of Amapata, because her captain re fused to deliver up passengers in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of the military authorities of Honduras, our mluister to that ountry under instructions protested against the wanton act and demanded satis faction. The government of Honduras, ac tuated by the sense of justice, and in a spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the illegal conduct of its officers, and expressed sincere regret for the occurrence. Il is confidently anticipated that a satis factory adjustment will soon be reached of the q cations arising out of the seizure and use of American vessels by insurgents in Honduras and the subsequent denial by the successful government of commercial privileges to those vessels on that account. Republic of i.llieriu. A notable pan of tue southeasterly coast of Liberia between Cavlly and Ban Pedoro rivers, wnich for nearly half a century has been generally recognized as belonging to that republic by cession and purchase, has been claimed to be under the protectorate of Frauce in virtue of agreements entered into by the na tive iribes over whom L.beriau control has not been well maintained More recently, nego tiations between the Liberian represent ative and the French gowrnment re sulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby as an adjustment cenain Liberian ter ritory is ceded to France. This convention at lasi advices had not been ratified by the Lit/cnau legislature and executive. Feeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of thisllt lie commonwealth, the establishment and de velopment of which were largely aided by the benevolence of our countrymen, and which con siliums the only independently sovereign state on the west coast of Africa, this government has suggested to the French government its earnest concern lest territorial Impairment In Liberia should take place without her uncon strained consent. Mexico. Onr relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly nature which should always characterize the intercourse of two neighboring republics. The work ot re'ocallng the monu ments marking the boundary between the countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is now nearly completed. The commission re cently organized under the conventions of 1884 and 1889 it is expected will spec lily settle dis putes growing out of the shifting currents of the Kio Grande river east of El Paso. .Nicaragua and Guatemala. Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at first successful hav ing in turn heen displaced by another. Our newly-appointed minister, by his timely good offices, aided in a peaceful adjustment of the controversy involved in ihe first conflict. The large American interests established in that country in connection with the Nicaragua canal were not molested. The canal company has. unfortunately, become financially seriously embarrassed, but a generous treatment has been extended to il by the government of Nic aragua. The United .Slates are especially in terested in the successful achievement of the vast undertaking this company has in charge. That it should be accomplished under distinc tively American auspices, and us enjoyment assured, not only to the vessels of this country as a channel of communication between our At lantic and Pacific seaboards, but to the ships of the world in the interests of civilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit of question. Guatemala has also been visited by the po ll I leal vicissitudes which have afflicted her Central American neighbors, but the dissolu tion of her legislature and the proclamation of a dictalorshlp have been unattended with civil war. Extradition with Norway and Russia. An extradition treaty with Norway has re cently been proclaimed and exchanged. The extradition treatv with Russia, signed in March, 1887, and amended and confirmed by the senate in February last, was duly proclaimed last June. The Samoan Troubles. Led by desire to compose differences and con tribute to the restoration of order in Samoa, wnich for some years previous had been the scene of conflicting foreign pretensions and na tive strife, the United states, departing from its policy consecrated by a century of observ ance, entered four years ago into ihe treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming jointly hound with England and Germany to establish and maintain Malietoa. Lattpepa as king of Samoa. The treaty provided for a foreign court of justice; a municipal council for the dis trict of Apia, with a foreign president thereof, authorized to advise the king; a tribunal for ihe setlh uient of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system for the kingdom. Jt imposed upon the three powers that part of the cost of the new government not met by the revenue of the islands Early in the lile of this triple protectorate the native dissensions it was designed to quell revived. Rivals defied the authority of the new king, refusing to pay taxes and de manding the election of a ruler by native suf frage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number of his adherents were In open rebellion on one of the islands. Quite lately, at the request of ihe other powers, and in ful fillment of its treaty obligation, this govern ment agreed to unite in u joint military move ment of such dimensions as would probably se cure the surrender of the insurgents without bloodshed. The warship Philadelphia was ac cordingly put under orders for Samoa, but be fore she arr.ved ihe threatened conflict was precipitated by King Malletoa’a at tack upon the insurgent camp. Mataafa was defeated and a number of men killed. Tee British and German naval ves sels present subsequently secured the surren der of Mataafa and his adherents. The defeated chief and ten of his principal support ers were deponed to a German island of the Marshall group w here they are held as prison c-s under the joint responsibility and cost of the three puw< is. T4is incident and the events leading up to it singularly illustrate the impolicy of est ablish ing alliances with foreign powers. important imuteis rare demanded attention in our relations with the Ottoman purte. The firing and partial destruction, by an unre strained mol), id one of the school buildings of Anatolia college, established hy citizens of the United States at Marsuvan. and the apparent indifference of the Turkish government to the outrage, notwithstanding the com plicity of some of u< officials, called for earnest remonstrance. which was followed by prumisi s of reparation and punish ment of the offenders. Indemnity for the in jury to the buildings has already been paid, permission to rebuild given, registration of the school property in the name of the American owners secured, and efficient protection guar anteed. Information received of maltreatment suf fered hy an inoffensive American woman en gaged in missionary work In Turkish Koordls tan was followed by such representations to the porle as resulted in the issuance of orders for the punishment of her assailants, the re moval of a delinquent official, and the adoption of measures for the protection of our citizens engaged in mission and other lawful work in that quarter. Turkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this country not to identify them selves in good faith with our people, but w ith the Intention of returning to the land of their birth and there engaging in sedition. This complaint Is not wholly without founda tion. A journal published in this country in the Armenian language openly counsels .its readers to arm, organize ard participate in movements for the subversion of Turkish authority in the Asiatic provinces. The Ottoman government has announced its intention to expel from its dominions Armenians who have obtained nat uralization in the United States since 1868. Will Protect Armenians. The right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of sovereignty. It is a right asserted and. to a limited extent, enforced by the United States with the sanction of our highest court. There being no naturalization treaty between the United States and Turkey, our minister at Constantinople has been in structed that, while recognizing the right of that government to enforce its declared policy against naturalized Armenians, he Is expected to protect them from unnecessary harshness of treatment Relations with Venezuela. In view of the impaired financial resources of Venezuela, consequent upon the recent revolu tion there, a modified arrangement for the sat isfaction of the awards of the late revisory claims commission, in progressive install ments, has been assented to and payments are being regularly made thereunder. The boun dary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana is yet unadjusted. A restoration of diplomatic intercourse between the republic and Great Britain and reference of the ques tion to impartial arbitration, would be a most gratifying consummation. The ratification by Venezuela of the.convention.or the arbitration of the long deferred claim of the Venezuelan trans portation company, is awaited. The Hawaiian Affair. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment Just prior to the installation of the present ad ministration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government of the islands and the United States and submitted to the senate for I ratification. This treaty I withdrew for exam -1 ination.and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount,of Georgia, to Houolulu as a special commissioner to make an impartial investigation of the cir cumstances attending the change of govern ment, and ail the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and ex haustive examination Mr Blount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government, and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States which was landed for that purpose at the in stance of our minister. yjwn the facts develops it sc'-Ulcd iu n.,. toe lU.j iiuu^iau.c course for our gnvernmf'nt to pursue wa= to undo the wrung mat liuo u i l dune by tho.se representing m and restore as far as prac ticable the status existing at the time ol our forcible Intervention. V. iih a vie*, oi accom plishing this result within the constitutional imlts of executive power. and recognizing ail our obligations and growing out of any changed conditions brought by our unjustifiable interference, oir present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instruc tions to that end. A Special Forthcoming. Thus far no information of the accomplish ment of any definite resu.t s has been received from him Additional advices are soon ex pected. When received they wiii be promptly sect to the congress, together with ail other in formation at hand, accompanied by a special executive message fully and tailing al! the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all the materi al events leading up to the present situation. Favorable to Arbitration. By a cone pit ut resolution, passed, by the senate February 14. 1890. and by the bouse of representatives on the 3d of April lollowiug. the president was requested to • 'invite,from time to time, as fit o castons may arise, negotiations with any government wita whkh toe United States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or dis putes arising between me two govern ments which cannot be adjusted by diplo matic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means. ” April 18. IB9J, the international American con ference of Washington by resolution expressed the wish that ml controversies between the re publics of America and the nations of Europe might be settled by arbitration, and recom mended that the government of each nation represented in that conference should commu nicate this wish to all triendly powers A favorable response has been received from Great Britain In the shape of a resolution adopted in parliament July 16 last, cordially sympathizing with the purpose in view, and ex pressing the hope that her majesty’s govern ment will lend ready cooperation to the govern ment of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent resolution above quoted It affords me signal pleasure to lay tins parliamentary resolution before the congress, and to express my sincere gratification that the sentiment of two great and kindred nations is thus authori tatively manifest in favor of the rational and peaceable settlement of international quarrels by honorable resort to arbitration. tirade of Foreign Envoys liaised. tjince the passage of the act oi March 3, 1893, authorizing ihe president to raise the grade of our envoys to correspond with the rank iu which foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France. Italy and Ger many have conferred upon their representa tives at this capital Ihe title ol ambassador, and X have responded by accrediting the agent Of the Unilea Slates in those countries with the same title A like elevation of mission is announced by Russia, and when made will be similarly met. This step fittingly comports with the position the United States holds in the family of na tions. During my former administration 1 took occasion to recommend a revest of the laws re lating to Ihe consular service in order that it might become a more efficient agency in the promotion of the interests it was intended to subserve. The duties and powers of consuls hare been expanded with the growing require ments ol our foreign trade. Discharging im portant duties affecting our commerce anti American citizens abroad, and in certain coun tries exercising judicial functions, these offi cers sho’uld be then of character, intelligence and ability. Copyright Extended to Denmark. Upon proof that the legislation of Denmark secures copyright to American citizens on equal footing with its own, the privileges of our copyright laws have been extended by procla mation to subjects of that country. I-innneial .Statement. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from al! sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893 amounted to *461,710,561.94 and its expenditures to *459,874,674.29.

The sum paid from the treasury for sugar bounty was 10.375,130.88, an increase’ over the preceding year of 42,033,003 05. Estimates. It is estimated upon the basis of present rev enue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 3), 1891, will be St3).- 121,365.38 and its expenditures it 458,121,365.38, re sulting in a deficiency of 428,000,000. Our 4 mutilation. On the first day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in circulation, or not included in treasury holdings, was f1,718,544,- 682. an Increase for the year of 4112,404,947. Es timating our population at 67,426,000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was 625.49. On the same date there was in the treasury fold bullion amounting to 896.657,273 and silver ulllon which was purchased at a cost of 4126.- 261.553. Silver Bullion Purchases. The purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1890. during the last fiscal year, aggregated S 4,008,162.69 fine ounces, which cost 445,551,- 4.53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that tax became operative until the repeal of Its purchasing clause, on the Ist flay of November, 1898. was 4168,674,- 590.46 fine ounces, which cost 4155,930,- No .81. Between the Ist day of March, 1873, and the Ist day of November, 1893, the government purchased, under all laws, 5)3,- X)3,7!7 tine ounces of silver at a cost of 25)6,622,- M 8 The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of July 14. 1890, number 36.087,285. The seigniorage arising from such coinage was 16.977.098.39, leaving on baud iu the mints 14'.- K 99.760 fine ounces of silver, which.cost t1.6,758,- 118. Coinage Statistics. Our total coinage of all metals during the last fiscal year consisted of 97.28>,875 pieces, valued at $43,685,178.81, of which there was *30,038,14:) in gold coin, $'3,343,71') in silver dollars, $7,217.2210.9J In subsidiary silver coins and $1,086, U)2.90 in minor coins. During the calendar year 1892 the production of precious metals in the United States was estimated to be 1.596,375 line ounces of gold of the commercial and coinage value of $33,000,0)0 and 58.004,00) mine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $50,- 750,000 and of t*e coinage value of $74,989,900 It is estimated that on the Ist day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money in the United Stales, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1,213,559,169. of which $597,697,683 was gold and $615,861,484 was silver. New ami Suspended Hanks. One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year ending October 81, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-six went into voluntary liquidation and 158 sus pended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were insolvent, eighty-six resumed business and seven remained in the hands of bank ex aminers. with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks organized forty-four were located in the eastern states, forty-one west of the Mississippi river and thirty-four in the central and southern states The total number of national banks in existence on the 81st day of October. 1893 was 3,79.5. having an aggregate capital of $695,558.12 ) Net increase in the cir culation of these banks during the year was 136.884.972 Repeal of the Silver Hurehaslug Clause. The recent repeal of the provisions of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the governmeu’ as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change In the com plexion of our currency afiairs. Ido not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time precisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any, supplementary legislation may, in the light of •uch conditions, appear to be essential or ex pedient Confident of the Future. Of course, after the recent financial perturba tion, time is necessary for the reestablishment Of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence the money which has been frightened into hoarding places Is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probabl3’ disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every require ment of our increasing population and busi ness. In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be con tent with nothing less than a lasting and com prehensive financial plan. In these circum stances I am convinced that a reasonable delay In dealing with this subject, instead of being in jurious. will increase the probability of wise action. The Monetary Conference- The monetary conference which assembled at Brussels upon our invitation was adjourned $o the 30th day of November in the present year. The considerations just stated and the fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be ex pected upon the reassembling of the conference ted me to express a willingness to have the meeting still further postponed. It seems to me that it would be wise to give general a uthorl ty r o the president to invite other nations to I such a conference at any time when there should be a fair prospect o t accomplishing an ■ international agreement on the subject of I coinage. Recommendation Regarding Bonds. I desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending the existing statutes in regard to • the issuance of government bonds. The au thority now vested in the secretary of the | treasury to issue bonds is not as clear as it should be. and the bonds authorized are disad , vamageotis to the government both as to the time of their maturity and rate of interest. Immigration Statistics. The superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, reports that dur ing the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 4+4,793 immigrants. Of these 1,063 were not permitted to land under the limitations of jaw. and 577 were ref "ted to * * countries from wnonce tooy came, by reason of tueir Hav ing become public charges The total arrivals were 141.034 less than lor the previous year. I'revention of Disease. Tin- secretary in his report gives an account ol toe operation of the marine hosp.tai service •no ol lue good work done under its supervision in preventing the entrance and spread of con tagious diseases. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public heailh and the demonstrated danger of the introduction ot contagious diseases from foreign ports baa invesied tue subject of national quarantine with increased interest. A more general and har monious system than now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhere, and con stantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the invasion of disease, and at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I be lieve, add greatly to the safety of our people 'the War department. The secretary of war reports that the strength ot the armv on the 3*3th day of Sep tember last was 25.778 enlisted men and 2,144 officers. The total expenditure of the depart ment lor me year ending June 30. 1893, amount ed to #51,906,074.94. Ol this sum, *1.992,581.05 was for salaries and contingent expenses; *23,- 377,828.35 tor the support oi the limitary estab lishment; *6.077.033.18 for miscellaneous ob jects. and *20.618,631.41 for public works. This latter sum includes *15,296.876 46 for river and harbor improvements and *3,266,141.20 for forti fications and other works of defense. The National Guard. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states was on the 3lst of October of the current year 112,59. officers auu enlisted men. The officers of the army detailed for the in spection and instruction of this reserve of our military force report that increased interest and marked progress are apparent iu the dis cipline aud efficiency of the organization. I'eace Has Reigned- Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic vio lence have called the army 'uio service during the year, and the oniy active military duty re quired of it has been in the department of Texas, where violations of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, eliciting tbe warm approval of ihe civil aud military au thorities of both countries. Reorganize the Army. The operation of wise laws and the influences of civilization constantly tending to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian hosiilities, together with the increasing ability of the states, through the efficiency of the na tional guard organizations to protect their citizens from domestic violence, lead to tbe suggestion unit the time Is fast approaching when there should be a reorganization of our army ou tbe lines of the present necessities of the conn try. This change contemplates neither increase in number nor added expense, but a redisit muuou ol the force and an encouragement of measures tend ing lo greater efficiency tne men and im provement of the service. The adoption of battalion formations for infantry regiments, Hie strengthening of the artillery force, the abandonment of smaller anu unnecessary posts, and the massing of the troops at impor tant and accessible stations, ali promise lo pro mote the usefulness of the arm;. In the judg ment of army officers, with nut few exceptions, the operation of Hit* law loruidding the reen listment of men after ten years service has not proved its wisdom, and while me arguments that led to its adoption were not without merit the experience of years constrains me to join in the recommendation for its repeat. Progress iu Coast Defense. it is gratifying to note that vve have begun lo attain completed results in Hie comprehen sive scheme ot seacoast delense aud fortifica tion, entered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been already expended, hut the cost ot maintenance will b* incon siderable as compared with the expense of construction and ordnance. Ai the end of the current calendar year me war depart ment will have nine 12-inch, twenty 10-mch and thirty-four 8-inch guns, ready to be mounted on gun-lifts and carriages, and seventy-five 12- inch mortars. In addition to the product of the army gun factory, now completed at Wa tervliet, the government has contracted with private parties tor the purchase of one hundred guns of these cali bers, the first of which should be delivered to the department for test before July 1, 189). The manufacture of heavy ord nance keeps pace with current needs; but lo render these guns available for the purposes they are designed to meet, emplacements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made in this direction, and it is desirable that con gress by adequate appropriations should pro vide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work. New Rifle for live Army. After much preliminary work and exhaustive examination in accordance with the require ments ot the law, the board appointed to select a magazine rifle of modern type, with which to replace the obsolete Springfield rifle of the in fantry service, completed its labors during the last year, and the work of manufacture is now in progress at the national armory at Spring field. It is confidently expected that by the end of the current year our infantry will be supplied with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive armies of the world. National Military Path. The work on the projected Chick amauga and Chattanooga national military park has been prosecuted with zeal and judg ment, and its opening will be cele brated during the coming year. Over nine t qua re imles of the Chlckamaaga battlefield O.VU iweutT’five miles of roau way have been constructed and permanent tab lets have been placed at many historical points, while the invitation to the states to mark the t*)Hilions of their troops participating in the battle has been very generally accepted. The work of locating and preserving the lines of battle at the Gettysburg battlefield is making satisfactory progress on the plans directed by the last congress. The Military Schools. Tbe reports of the Military academy at West Point and the several schools for special in structions of officers show marked advance in education of the army and a commendable am bition among its officers lo excel in the mili tary profession and to fit themselves for the highest service to the country. Under the supervision of Adjt. Gen. Robert Williams, lately retired, the bureau of military information has become well established and is performing a service that will put in possession of the government in time of war most valuable information aud at all times serve a purpose of great utility in keeping the army advised of the world’s progress in all matters pertaining to the art of war. The Judiciary Department. The report of the attorney general contains the usual summary of ihe affairs and proceedings ot the department of justice for the past year, together with certain recommendations as to needed legislation ou various subjects I can not too heartily indorse the proposition that the fee system as applicable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United States commis sioners, should be abolished with as little de lay as possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the business of the courts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively transacted as the ends of justice will allow. The system is therefor.: thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation ol court officials de pend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper execu tion of the law aud private gain, which cannot fail to be dangerous lo the rights and free dom of citizens and irrisistible temp tation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If in addition to this re form another was inaugurated which would give to the United States commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade of misdemeanors, especially those coming under the internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent administration of the criminal law. Iu my first message to congress, dated De cember 8, 1885. I stjroagly recommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils of ihe present system. Since that lime the criminal business of the federal courts and the expense attending it have enormously increased. The number of criminal prosecu tions pending In the circuit and district courts of the United States on the Ist day of July, 1885, was 3,898, of which 1,884 were for vio lations of the internal revenue laws, while the number of such prosecutions pending ou the Ist day of July. 1893, was 9,50), of which 4,20) were for* violation of the internal revenue laws. The expense of the United States courts, exclusive of judges’ salaries, for the year ending July 1, 1885, was 52.874,733 11 and for the year ending July 1, 1893, *4.528,676 87. It is. there fore. apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in the manner of enforcing the federal criminal law have gained cogency and gained strength in lapse of time. Indorses the Attorney General. 1 also heartily join the attorney general in recommending legislation fixing degrees of the crime of murder within federal jurisdiction, as has been done in many of the states: authoriz ing writs of errors in behalf •if the government in cases where final judgment is rendered against the sufficiency of an in dictment or against tue government upon any other question arising before actual trial; limiting the right of review in cases of felony punishable only by fine and im prisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy provision for the construction of such prisons and reformatories as may be necessary for tne confinement of United Slates convicts. Postal Affairs. The report of the postmaster general con tains a detailed statement of the operations of the post office department during the last fiscal year aud much interesting information touch ing this important branch of the public service. The business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the con dition of the business of the country, and depression in financial affairs inevitably and quickly reduces the postal revenues Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual be tween the post office receipts and expenditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmaster general s re port. Enormous Deficiency. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor that the deficiency ou the lth day of June, 189), would be but a little over *1,500,000. it amounted, however, to more than *5,000.000. At the same time, and under the influence of like anticipa tions, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 3), 1894. which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of f872,- 245 71; but pow. in view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that part of the cur rent fiscal vear already expired, the present postmaster general estimates that at its close instead ot a surplus there will be a deficiency of nearly *8 OOJ.OOo. The post office receipt* for the last fiscal year amounted to : 75.996.93d 16, and its expenditures to 581.074.0u4 ik). This post office deficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less mailer was carried free through the mails, an item of which Is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the agricultura. depart menu The total number of post offices In the United States on the Sjth day ol uuae. 1893. was 68.- 403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding year Of these 3,36) were presidential, an in crease in that class of 204 over the preceding year. The Free Delivery System. Forty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, mak ing a total of 610 cities aud towns provided with free delivery on June 30, 1893. Ninety three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of in sufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment, I am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law permit as general an introduction of this featqre of mall service as is necessary or justi fiable, and that it not be extended to smaller communities than are now desigua*ed. The expense of free delivery for the fiscal year end ing June 3u. 1894. will bp more than *11,000,003, and under legislation now existing there must be a constant increase in this item of expendi ture. Money Order Business. There were 6,401 additions to the domestic money order offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest increase In any year since the inauguration of the sytem. The total number of these offices at the close ot the year was 18,434. There were 13,309,735 money orders is sued from these offices, being an Increase over the preceding year ot 1,240,293 and the value of these orders amounted to *12T,576,- 483.66, an Increase of *7,509,632.58. There w ere also issued during the year postal notes amounting to *12,933,071073. During the year 195 international money-order offices were added to those already provided, making a to tal of 2,407 iu operation on June 30, 1893. The number of international money orders is sued during the year was 1,055,999, an increase over the preceding year of 72,525, and their value was *16,341,837 86, an increase of *1,221,- 506.81. The number of orders paid was 303,917, an increase over the preeedit. : year of 13,5j3, and their value was #6,283,875 7. an increase of *94,094.83. From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money orders and postal notes for the year amounted to *156,821.348.24, The number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special delivery was 3,375,- 698, an increase over the preceding year of nearly 22 per cent The special delivery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted 10 *337,569 30, and the messengers’ fees paid for their delivery amounted to *256.592.71. leaving a profit of *8).976 59. The Railway .Service. The railway mail service not onlv adds lo the promptness of mail delivery at all offices, but it is ihe especial instrumentality which puts the smaller and wav places in the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and terminal offices, 'this branch of the postal service has therefore received much attention from the postmaster general, and, though it is gratifying to know that it is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness. 1 am led to agree with the postmaster general, that there is room for its further improvement. Value of Civil Service Reform. There are now connected with the post office establishment 28,324 employes who are in the classified service. The head of this great de partment gives conclusive evidence of the value of civil service reform when, utter an ex perience that renders his judgment on the sub ject absolutely reliaole. he expresses the opinion that without the benefit of this system it would be impossible to conduct the vast busi ness intrusted to him. 1 desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the suggestions of the postmaster general relating u> a more sensible and business-like organization and u bet ter dis tribution o* responsibility in his department The Navy. The report of the secretary of the navy con tains a Irsiory of the operations of his depart ment during th- past year, ami exhibits a mosi gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. He presents a satisfactory account o' the progress which has been made in Me con struction of vessels and makes a number of recommendations to wuich attention is espe cially invited. C ruisers Kept Busy. During the past six months the demands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have been revolutions calling for vessels to protect American interests in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Ho a. Honduras, Argentina and Brazil, while the condition of affairs in Honi'- lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With ali these calls upon our navy, it became necessary, in order to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Behring sea un der the modus vivendi agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that service one vessel from tbe .fish commission and three from the revenue marine. Progress in the construction of new vessels has not been as rapid as was anticipated. There has been delay in the completion of un armored vessels, but for the most pari they have been such as are constantly occurring even in countries having the largest experience in naval ship building. The most serious de lays, however, have been in the work upon armored ships, Tiie trouble has been the fail ure of contractors to deliver armor as agreed. The difficulties seem now, however, to have been all overcome, and armor is being delivered with satisfactory promptness. Our Reorganized Navy. Asa result of the experience acquired by ship builders and designers twn] material men, it is believed that the dates when vessels will be completed can now be estimated with rea sonable accuracy Great gu is. rapid fire guns, torpedoes and powder arc being promptly sup plied. The following vessels of Ihe new navy have been completed and are now ready for service; The double-tnrreted coast-defense monitor the double-tnrreted coast-de fense monitor Monterey, the armored cruiser New York, the protected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, San Francisco, Charleston. Atlanta and Boston, the cruise? Detroit. Hie gunboats Yorktown, Concord, Bennington. Machias, Castiue and Petrel, the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the practice vessel Bancroft and the dynamite gunboat Vesuvius. Of these the Bancroft, Machias, Detroit and Catiline have been placed in commission during the current calendar year. The following vessels are in progress of con struction: The second-c 1 ass battleship Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marblehead, and ihe coast-defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrite and Monadnock, all of which will be completed within one year; the harbor defense Rum Katahdin and the pro tected cruisers Columbia.Minneapolis,Olympia, Cincinnati and Raleigh, all of which will bo completed prior to July 1, 1895. the first-class battleships lowa. Indiana, Massachusetts ana Oregon, which will be completed by February l, 1896, and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed by August 1, of that year. It is also expected that the three gun boats authorized by the last congress will ba completed in less than two years. A Note of Warning. Since 1886 congress has at each session authorized the building of one or more vessels, and the secretary of the navy presents an earnest plea for the continuance of Ihis plan. He recommends the authori zation of at least one battleship and six torpedo boats. While i am dis tinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient navy I cannot refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take into account the number of un finished vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of our treasury in considering ihe propriety of an appropriation at this time to begin new work. The method of employing mechanical labor at navy yards through boards of labor, and making efficiency the sole lest by which labor ers are employed and continued, is produc ing the best results, and the secretary is earnestly devoting himself to Its development Attention is invited to the statements of his report in regard to the workings of the system. The Pension Bolls. The secretary ol the interior has the super vision of so many important subjects that his report is of especial value and interest. On the Sothday of June. 1893, there were on thepen sion rolls 966,012 names, an increase of 89,944 over the number on the rolls June 30, 1892. Of these there were 167 widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,- 518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3.332 survivors and widows of Indian wars. 284 army nurses and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the war of the rebellion. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disa bilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number or persons remaining on the roils June 30. 1893. who were pensioned un der tbe act of June 27. 1890, which allows pen sions on account of death and disability not chargeable to army service, was 459,155. The number added to the rolls during the year was 123.634 and the number dropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions al lowed during the year amounted to *33,756,- 549.98. This includes arrears, or the accumu lation between the time from which the al lowance of pension dates and the time of actual ly granting the certificate. Pensions for Disabilities. Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for disabilities not related to idßitary service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability must exist incapacitating applicants “from the per formance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support-’’ 'lhe execution of this law in its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with its true intention; but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to ihe statute and since that lime this construction nas been followed. This has haa the effect of limiting the operation of the law lo its intended purpose The discovery caving been made that many names hid be* n put upon the ix.-nsioa roll by means of wholesale and gigantic Irauas, the commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to to fraudulent or unauthorized pending a com plete examination, giving notice to the pension ers in order that they m.gbt have an opportun ity to establish, if possible, the justice of Ihi—: Claims notwitha landing apparent invalidity. Frauds Should Ue Exposed. This, 1 understand. Is the practice which haa for a long time prevailed in the pension bureau, but after entering upon these recent investigations the commissioner modi (leu th s rule so as not to allow, until after complete ex amination. interference with the payment of a pension apparently not altogether void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate h*rh**r than authorized by law. 1 am uuaiue to understand why frauds in the p-n.-uoi* rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudu lently put upon these rolls is a wicked lynno*'- Hon upon the Kindly seuumeut in wuicu pen sions have their origin. Every fraudulent pen sioner has become a had citizen: every false oath in support of a pension has made perjury more common, and false and undeserving pen sioners rob tae people not ou.y of u.etr money but of the patr.otic sentiment which the survivors of war, fought for •he preservation of the union, ought to in spire Thousands of neighborhoods have their well-known fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish ajri.ili ng conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. Hy no means the least wrong dune is to bt.ive .iud deserving pensioners, who certainly ou.rkt not to be condemned to such association' 'I hose w ho attempt in the line of duty to rectify t.n-sc wrongs should not be accused'of enmity or in diffc fence to the claims of honest vett runs. Enormous Lxpendil ores. The sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending .lime 3 >. 1893. was *158,74;i.467, 14. The commissioner estimates that <.J65,0j0.009 will be required to pay pensions during ti.u year ending June 30, 1694 Indian Affairs. 'l'he condition of the Indians and their ulti mate fate arc subjects which are related to u -acred duty of the government and which strongly appeal to the sense of justice and dm sympunv oi oar people. Onr finnan* number about 248,000 Most of them are toe .ted on Ifll reservations, contain ing 116531 acres of land. About IM.OOo of iik-sc inuiaus have, to a large degree, adopted civilized customs. Lands in severally have been allotted u. many of them. Such allott in-mis have been made to 10.000 individuals dur ing the '..si fiscal year, embracing about 1 <X) '.0.0 acres. The number of Indian gov ernment schools open during the year was 195, an increase of twelve over the preceding year Of this total 170 were on reservations, of which seventy-three were hoarding schools and muc.y-seven were day schools. Twenty board ing schools and live day schools supported by ibe government were not located on reserva tions. '1 he total number of Indian children en rolled during Uie year us attendants of all schools wa- 21.138, an increase of i,2SI over tho enrollment for the previous year. \> liai as Lest for the Indian. lam sure that secular education and moral and religions teaching must he important fac tors In an i ft or i to save the Indian and lead him to civilization. 1 believe, too, that the relin quishment of tribal relations and the holding of laud in severally may, in favorable conditions, aid this consummation. It seems to me. how ever. that allotment of land in severalty ought to be made wi ih great care and circumspection. If hastily done before the Indian knows its mean ing. while yet he has little or no idea of idling a farm and no conception of thrift, liter- is great danger that a reservation life in tribal relations may be e xchanged for the pauperism of civilization, instead of tts independence and elevation. The solution of the Indian problem depends very largely upon good administration. Me personal fitness of agent* and their adapt ability to the peculiar duty of caring for their wards are of the utmost impt rutnee. Danger of Abuses. The law providing that, except in especial cases, army officers shall be detailed as Indian agents, it is hoped will prove a successful experiment. There is danger of great abuses creeping into the prosecution of claims for Indian depredations, and I recommend that every possible safeguard lie provided against the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims of this description The appropriations on account of the Indian bureau for the year ending June 31, 1894, amount to *7,954,962.99, a decrease as compared with the year preceding it of 4387.131.95. Private Control of Public Lands. The vast area ol land which, but a short time ago, constituted the public domain is rapidly falling into private hands. It is certain that iit the transfer the beneficent Intention of the gov ernment to supply from its domain homes to the industrious and worthy homescekers is often frustrated. Though the speculator, who stands with extortionate purpose between •In land office and those who, with their families, are invited by the government to settle on the public lands, is a despicable character who ought not to he tolerated, yet it is difficult to thwart his schemes. Opening of the Strip. The recent opening to settlement of the lands in the Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of 6.5)0,60 acres, notwithstanding the ut most care in framing the regulations governing the selection of locations and notwithstanding the presence of United Stales troops, fur nished an exhibition, though perhaps in a mod ified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence and the fraudulent occupation which hate ac companied previous op -nings of public land. I concur with the secretary in the belief that these outrageous incidents cannot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subject, and 1 hope ids recom mendations in that direction will be favorably considered. Preserve I be forests. I especially commend to the attention of the congress the statements contained in the secre tary's report concerning forestry. The time has come when efficient measures should he taken for the preservation of our forests from indiscriminate and remorseless destruc tion. The report of tbe secretary of agriculture will be found exceedingly in teresting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately concerned in agri cultural occupations. On the 7th of March. 1893, there were upon its payrolls 2.4 10 employes. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted public treasury and the imperative demand of the people tor economy in the administration of their government, the secretary has entered upon the task ol rational ly reducing expenditures by the elimination from the payrolls of all persons not needed lor an efficient conduct of the affairs of the depart ment tutting Down Expenses. During the first quarter ot the present year the expenses of the department aggregated *345,876.76, as against *402.012 42 for the corre sponding period of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. The secretary makes apparent his in tention to continue this rale of reduction hy submitting estimates lor the, next fiscal year less by *991,280 than those for the present year. Among the heads of divisions in this depart ment the changes have been exceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and res ignations have been filled by the promotion of assistants in the same divisions. These promo tions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only been in the interest of official work, but have suggested to tnose in the de partment who look for retention and promo tion that merit and devotion to duty are their best reliance. The amount appropriated Tor tiie bureau of animal industry for the current fiscal year is “850,000; the estimate for the ensuing year is 8700,000. Contagious Diseases of Animals. The regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during the last year, and tho largest stock yards of the country have been kept free from infection. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely such as could have been effectually guarded against by the owners of tbe affected cattle. While con tagious pleuro pneumonia in cattle has been eradicated, animal tuberculosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life than piettro pneumonia. is still prevalent. In vestigations have been made during the past year as to the means of its communication and the method of its correct diagnosis. Much progress has been made in this direction by the studies of the division of animal pathology, but work ought to tie extended in cooperation with local authorities until the danger to hu man life arising from this cause is reduced to a minimum. The number of animals arrived from Canada during the year and inspected by bureau offi cers was 462.092, and the number from trans- Atlantic countries was 1,297. No contagious diseases were found among the reported ani mals. The total number of inspections of cat tle for export during the past fiscal year was 611.542. Falling Off m Exports. The exports show a falling off of about 25 per cent, from the preceding year, the decrease oc curring entirely in the last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an increase in the price of American export cattle. During the year end ing June 30, 1893, exports of Inspected pork ag gregated 20,677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874 pounds for the preceding year. The failing off in this export was not confined, however, to in spected pork, the total quantity exported in 1892 being 665.490,616 pounds, while in 1893 it was only 527,308,695 pounds. I join the secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant fei the position of in spector or assistant inspector in the bu reau of animal Industry he required, as a condition precedent to his appointment, to exhibit to the United States civil serv ice commission his diploma from an established, regular and reputable veterinary college, and that this be supplemented by such an examina tion in veterinary science as the commission may prescribe. Exports of Agricultural Products. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1802. attained the enormous figure of *800,000,030, in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total exports. In tbe last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached *615,000,000, being 75.1 per cent, of all American commodities exported. A review’ of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle, the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, 526,003,000, of which Great Britain took considerably over *25,090,000. Of beef products of all kinds our total exports were *28.000,090, of which Great Britain took 824,000,- 000 Of pork produtds the total exports were *84.- 000,000, of which Great Britain took 858.000,000. In breadstuffs. cotton and minor products like proportions sent to tbe same destination are shown. Service of Great Value. The work of the statistical division of the de our linen l of agriculture deals with alt that re lates to the economies of farming. The mala purpose of Its montnly reports is to keep the farmers informed as fully as possible of all mutters having any influence upon the world's markets. in which the products find sale. Its publications relate especially to the commercial side of farming. It is there fore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers of the United States, who rep resent nearly one-half of our population, and a.so of direct interest to the whole country that the work of this division be efficiently performed and that the informaniou It has gathered he promptly diffused It is a matter of congratulation to know that the secretary will not spare any effort to make thls iu * work thoroughly useful In the year 1838 the congress appropriated *1 0,10 to be taken from the patent office funds for the pur pose of collecting and distributing rare and Im |n’o\o(i vaviftios of stoics utul for prosccutiiu? agricultural investigations and procuring agri cultural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the department of agricul ture has grow n to its present unwieldy and tin justifiably extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year tbe cost of seeds purchased was 866,548,61. The remainder of an appropriation of *135.000 was expended in put ting them up and distributing them. It surely never could have entered the minds of those who first sanctioned appropriations of public money for the purchase of new and improved tarieties of seeds for gratuit ous distribution that from this would grow large appropriations for the purpose ot distribution by members of congress of or dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings, which are common in all the states and territories and everywhere easily obtained at low prices. Wasteful Distribution of Seeds. In each slate and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and lost new varieties of seeds; and yet this indis criminate and wasteful distribution of legisla tion and legislators continues, answering no purpose uuless It be to remind constituents that their representatives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. Under the sanction of existing legislation, there was sent out from the agricultural depart ment during the last fiscal year enough of cab bage seed to plant 19,200 acres of land, a sufll clem quantity of beans to plant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,500 acres. sw*et corn enough to plant 7.80 J acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,205 acres with vines, and enough musktneUm and watermelon seeds to p1ant.2,675 acres. The total quantity of Mower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was con tained In more than 9,090.000 packages and they were sufficient, if planted, to cover 89.596 acre’s of laud. Should He Abolished. In view of these facts this enormous expendi ture without legitimate returns of benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a consum mation so manifestly in the interests of good administration more titan 

*IOO,OOO has been stricken from the estimate made to cover this object for the year ending June 30, 5895, and the secretary recommends Jthat the remaining *35.000 of the esti ate be confined strictly to the purchase of new ami improved varieties of seeds, and that these be distributed throughout experiment sta tions. Thus the seed will be tested, and alter the lost has been completed by the experiment stations, the propagation of the useful varieties and the rejection of tbe valueless may safely be left to tiie common sense of the people. Workings of the <’lvll Service tan. The continued intelligent execution of the civ 1 service law and the increasing approval ot the people of its operation are most gratifying Tne recent extension of its limitations and regulations to the employes at free de livery post offices, which has been bon eslly and promptly accomplished by the Commission, with the hearty cooperation of the postmaster general, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system 1 am. if possible, more than ever convinced of the in calculable benefits conferred by tiie civil serv ice law, not only in its effect upon the public service, but also, what is even more important. In its effect in elevating the tone of political life generally. Popular Love ol Right and Justice. The course of civil service reform in this country instructively and interestingly illus trates how strong a hold a movement gains upon onr people which Inis underlying it a sen timent of justice and right, and which at the same time promises better administration ot their government. The law embodying this reform found Us way to onr statute book more from fear of tie popular sentiment existing in its favor than from any love for the reform itself on the part of legislators; audit lias lived and grown and flourished in spite of the covert as well as open hostility of spoilsmen and not withstand.ug the querulous impracticability ol many’self-constituted guardians. Iteacalh all the vagaries and sublimated theories which are attracted to it there underlies this reforma sturdy common-sense principle not only suited to this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing tube absolutely essential to the most successful op eration of their government, if not to its per petuity. An I iieonsisl eney Pointed tint. It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform, as well as with its liest enforcement, to oblige the coin mission to rely for clerical assistance niton clerks detailed irom other departments. I’lierc ought not to b- such a condition mi any depart ment that clerks hired to do the vvo’-k there can he spared to habitually work at another place: and it ik.es not accord with a sensible view of civil service reform that persons should lie employed on tin* theory that their labor is necessary In one department, when in point of fact their services are devoted to en tirely different work in another department. 1 earnestly urge that tiie clerks necessary to carry on the work of the commission be regu larly put upon its roster, ami that the system of obliging the commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other depart ments be discontinued. This ought not to in crease the expense to the: government, while it would certainly be more consistent and add greatly to the efficiency of I lie commission. Economy In Urged. Economy in public expenditure is a duly that cannot innocently be neglected by those intrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless re sources, the familiarity of our people with im mense accumulations of wealth the growing sentiment among them that the expenditures of public money should in some manner be to their immediate and personal advantage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a de generated sense of official accountability iiave led to growing extravagance in governmental appropriations. At this time, when a depleted public treasury confronts us, when many of our people are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of life and when enforced economy is pressing upon the great mass of our country men, I desire to urge, with all the earnestness at rny command, that congressional legislation be so limited by strict ci onomy a.s to exhibit an appreciation of the condition of the treasury and a sympathy with the strained circum stances of our fellow citizens. The and ity ol public economy is also of immense importance In its intimate amt necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditures and yet reducing tne people's burden of federal taxation Tariff Itoforiii Be ore ( a. After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before ns. Nothing so important claims our at tention aud nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duly -an oppor tunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow [ citizns and a duty Imposed upon us by our oft repeated professions and by the emphatic man date of the people. After full discussion onr countrymen have spoken in favor of this re form, and they have confide** tb<- work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. For K<-u-iiti" Only. If there is anything in t.fte theory of a repre sentation in public places or the people and. their desires, if pub ic officers are ready the servants of the people, and if political promises and professions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our efforts until this reform Is ac ompltsue I by wise and careful legislation. Whip we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties aud other federal taxation, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that condi tions have grown tip among us which in justice and fairness cal! for discriminating care In the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually de mand. Reduction Must He Substantial. Manifestly, if we are to aid the people direct ly through tariff reform, one of its most obvi ous features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon !he necessaries of life The benefits of such a reduction would be palpa ble and substantial, seen and fell by thousands who would be better fed ana better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the will ing benefactions of a government whose high est function is the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our people's pros perity a.id well-being ts tbe removal of restric tions upon the importation of tbe raw materi als necessary to our manufactures Tbe world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while federal*legis lation. through the imposition of high tariff, forbids to American manufactures as cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It Is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products resulting from this policy not only confines the market for these products within our own borders, to the direct djsadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to om citizens. Labor’s Interests Involved. The interests of labor are certainly though, indirectly involved in this feature of our tariff system The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. '1 hen follows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a discharge of employes, and distress* in the homes of our workingmea. Even if the often disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw Materials and low tariff duties, the intelligence of our workingmen leads them quickly to discover that their steady employment, permitted hy free raw ma terials, is th" most important factor in their re lat.on to tariff legislation.
