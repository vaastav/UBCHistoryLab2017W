Colesworthy and Mrs. Fred Locklcy entertained the mem bers of the Thursday Afternoon club this week. On account of the near approach of the holiday season it was wisely decided not to huve a study program. The diversion of the afternoon was a unique guessing contest, consisting of attractive little pictures represent ing questions and their answers, sus pended about the walls. The test lay In the ability of the contestants to find the correct answer, which was often an enigma or a robus. The re sult was a tie for the first honors, but In the draw which followed, the first prize, a batidsome souvenir spoon, was awarded to Mrs. B. Huffman, nnd to Mrs. Prideun the second. Delicious refreshments were served In the dining room, Mrs. T. C. Taylor presiding at the coffee, assisted by Mrr. Lnntz and Miss Adnah Raley.

Those who are famil iar with this course know what a de- Mny Not Rebuild Xumpu Foundry,'. It rill! remains undecided as to whether the Nampa foundry and ma chine shops which were destroyed by fire here lost week are to be rebuilt, or whether the local business men are going to allow the chance of a lifetime to slip through their fingers to some ne'-ghfcoilng locnllty. The Insurance adjusters are on the ground, but not a word has leaked out In regard to the rebuilding of the plant. Between $8000 and $9000 worth of work Is available should the plant be rehullt at once. The question Is, can Nimpa of.'ord to lose an Institution' employing between 25 and 30 men nnd doing close to JfiOOO worth of business through the local banks each month. Now that the question has been put to the Commercial club It Is to be hoped the cluh will take Immediate and ag gressive action, that will Insure the rebuilding of the plant. Nampa Record.
