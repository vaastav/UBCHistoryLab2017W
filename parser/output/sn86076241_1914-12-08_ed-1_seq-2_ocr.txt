TUESDAY EVENING THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Continued from Srst page great matter and to avow my convic tions with deep earnestness. I have tried to know what America is; what her people think, what they are, what they most cherish and hold dear. I hope that some of their finer passions are in my own heart some of the great conceptions and desires which gave 'birth to this government and which have made the voice of this people a voice of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world and that, speaking my own thoughts, I shall at least in part, speak theirs also, however faintly and inadequately upon this vital matter. We are at peace with all the world. No one who speaks counsel based .on fact or drawn from a just and candid interpretation of realities can say thnt there is reason to fear that from any quarter our independence or the in tegrity of our territory is threatened. Dread of the power f( any other na tion we are incapable of. We are not jealous of rivalry in the fields of com merce or of aiy other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our own lives as we will; but we mean also to let live. We are indeed a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet the possessions of none, desire the over throw of none. Our friendship can be accepted and is accepted without reservation, because it is offered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever question or suspect. There in lies our greatness. We are the champions of peace and of concord. And we should be very jealous - f this distinction which we have sought to earn. Just now we should be par ticularly jealous of it, because it is our dearest present hope that this character and reputation may present ly,, in God s providence, bring us an opportunity such as has seldom been vouchsafed any nation, the opportuni ty to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a' heal ing settlement of many a matter thit has cooled and interrupted the friend ship of nations. This- is the time above all others when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self-possession, our influence by pre serving our ancient principles of ac tion. From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to mil itary establishments. We never have; had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals we never shell have, a large standing army. If ask ed, are you ready to defend your selves? We reply, most assuredly, to the utmost, and yet. we shall not turn' America into a military camp. We will not ask our young men to spend -the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves. There is another sort of "energy in us. It will know how to declare itself and make itself effective should occasion arise. And especially when half the world is on fire we shall be careful to make our moral insurance against the spread of the conflagration very j definite and certain and adequate in-1 deed. Let us remind ourselves, therefore, of the only thing we can do or will do. We must depend in every time f national peril, in the future as in the past, not upon a standing army, nor yet upon a reserve army, but upon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based on our accus tomed orincioles and practices, to provide a System by which every citi- zen who will volunteer for the train- I ing may be made family wth the use of modern arms, and the rudiments , nf Hritl nn,l maneuver, and the main- tenance and sanitation of camps. We , should encourage such training and make it a means of discipline which our young men will learn to value It is right that we should provide it not only, but that we should make it as attractive as, possible, and so in duce our young men to undergo it at such times as they can command a little freedom and can seek the phys ical development they need for mere health's sake, if for nothing, more. Every means by which such things can be stimulated is legitimate and such a method smacks of true Ameri can ideas. It is right, too, that the national guard of . the states should the State of Nevada and for the Ormsby, Nevada 

DECEMBER 8, 1914 I be duplicated and strengthened by every means which is not inconsist ent with our obligations to our own people or with the established policy of our government. And this also, not because of the time or occasion specially calls for such measures, 'but because it should be our constant policy to make the provisions for our national peace and safety. More than this carries with it a re versal of the whole history and char acter of our policy. More than thh. proposed at this time, permit me to say. would mean that we had lost our self- possession, that we had been thrown off our balance by a war with which we have nothing to do, whose causes cannot touch us, whose very existence affords us opportunities of friendship and . disinterested service which should make us ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful prepar ation for trouble. This is assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a government like ours were raid ed up, the opportunity not only to speak but actually to embody and ex emplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting concord which is based on justice and fair and gen erous dealing. A powerful navy we have always re garded as our proper and natural means of defense; and jt has always been of defense that we have thought, not of conquest. Rut who shall tell us now what sort of a navy to build? We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas In the future as in the. past and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation in that. 'Our ships arc cur natural bulwarks. When will the experts tell us just what kind we should construct and, when will they be right for ten years together, if the relative efficiency of craft of different kinds and uses continues to change as we have seen it change under our very eyes in these last few" months. But I turn away from the subject. It is not new. There is no new need to discuss it. We shall not alter our attitude toward-, it, because some amongst us are nervous and excited. We shall easily and sensibly agree upon a policy of defense. The ques tion has not changed its aspects be cause the times are not normal. Our policy will not be for an occasion. It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing, which we will pursue at all seasons, without haste and af ter a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of the world, the 'abiding friendship of states, and the unham pered freedom pf all vlith whom we deal. Let there be, no misconception. I he country has been misinformed. We have not been negligent of na tional defense. We are not unmind ful of the great responsibility resting upon us.. We. shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new circumstances.; and what is needed will be adequately done I close, as I began, by reminding you of the great tasks and duties of peace which challenge our best pow ers and invite us to build what wiil last, the . tasks to which we can ad dress ourselves now and at all time: with free-hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive wis dom we possess. To develop our life and our resources; to supply our own people, and the people of the world as their need arises, from the abund ant plenty of our fields and our maris of trade; to enrich' the commerce of our own states and of the world with "' , "" our n". our hl Tit he .crea,tions f.Jjl lf thfe ff our cctertlat 18 wh.at .Wl11 ho,d ..ur 1 -r "l",u,uV ?na our entnusiasm steadily, "rnd " the.
