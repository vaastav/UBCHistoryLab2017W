Japanese Situation Daily Becomes Flore Threatening Californians Disagree Nearly Every Salient Point in Manner of Treating Yellow Fellows Feel ing Against Americans Is Becom ing Alarming in Japan. Washington, Dec. 5. The chapter In President Roosevelt's message re lating to the exclusion of the Japanese from the commcn schools of San Francisco has created a stir among 'the members of the California delega tloa In congress. They disagree with him on practically every salient point railed in his discussion of this ques tlon, and declare his chief contentions untenable. The president has not divulged what plans he has in mind for com pelling the San Francisco authorities to show what he considers a proper regard for the obligations devolving upon them under the treaty of 18S4 between Japan and the United States with respect to the treatment to be ac corded to citizens of Japan. Without exception members of the California delegation take exception to the president's declaration that the school authorities of San Francisco should net have excluded the Japan ese from the common schools. Fur thermore, they disagree with him in his contention that the Japanese un der the treaty of 1894. Furthermore they are united against his recom mendation for the passage of a law providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come here to become citizens. Feeding High at Frisco. oaa i riuoix', Dev.-. 5. President Roosevelt has stirred a storm in Cali fornia, which is felt from end to end along the Pacific coast by the state ments in his message on the Japanese. Among the masses of the 'people and particularly among labor unions, the most bitter feeling was aroused, and it is predicted freely that, unless something intervenes to change the sentiment, he has driven California i? not the entire Pacific coast from the Republican ranks. The people of the east have no conception of the depth of feeling cn the subject. Oregon and Washington, as well - as California, have declared for the exclusion of the Japanese and to all these states the president's words come as a direct affront. ' The president is excoriated for his threat to use troops and he openly is charged with deliberately misstating the position taken by the authorities of this city and the state. The Chron icle declares that the president has overstepped his authority in threaten ing to coerce San Francisco. Tho Daily Call is Inclined to ridicule Pres ident Roosevelt for his "excited rhet oric" and his misinformation. Should force be used the Califor nians declare they will not weaken, and while they may have to bow for the time being to federals dictation they will withdraw all the white chil dren from the public schools, and leave them in sole possession of the -Japanese.

White men have no chance at all with Japs in competition for a livelihood. They have already driven all the white men out of Hawaii, not only the mechanics and craftsmen, but the merchants as well.
