I from before Minrise each day iir. il ..ftcr sunset, I thought it cheaper, if wt s i amus.ng, t i employ a man to bring i. . lis jn. as well as the necessary chicken0, '."! and mutton. He kept me felly sup ;liei. bunting mice a week for deer, while !im lnys trapped partridges. I paid him, in1, own request, in salt pork and hard-tack (the latter food the Cracker ir intensely fond of), and supplied bim with powder, shot and to'ia--.

There w re four J us in mess, and our mcs-hiil, with all the ivive articles in plenty on our tabic, aen.;.ed about eight dollars each per mont'i . Another peculiarity ol the Florida Cracker, v.' en 1 knew Lim. was his indifference to in "71 mean actual money, not its equiv t.'...ii" He wanted " kind " when he traded, tin ! lie traded as sbaly an any Yankee. He w i '. '1 ' business with s ..- for bay or oat". co'n" or pork or bumblebee whisky, o' . best ol all, hnrd-tt-k. If you wem n t possessed of either of tb.- above ".rt.elcs. l.c vould trade with you for money. ' ut be evidi ntly did not knew much about t!.t He felt that he was treading on -:r mge ground, and scarcely knew how to f. r t.i-fect. In fact, he bad no use lor i' v Barter served all bis purposes. i trading for casb he would at one time the mo.-I exorbitant price upon an aiticle, tji at another as a aoaa so ridicoiouflly small a to impress tho uninitiated with the belie! tb.:i he was ' chamng." In elucidation of this peculiarity, 1 may :u;nt p at incident that occorred to one of mv otl.eer dontiT oir survey. In carrying .ur lir." t .ward the Gulf ol Mexico it was r,. .c-rv to cut long avenues through the w nJ- t lurta t!ic sides of the triangles ,v:i i-e iiiiiien-ij-s wc were todctcrmine. In ,! e c mrst ol the cutting an avenue would -.nK'timet. strike cultivated land, and tbe ;mp.i--iic negro would gravely march t .roi.gh a com or potato bcld, chopping i iwn trees and flooring " crops in rather mi alarming manner. Sometimes tbe avenue would shave a man's house, and shade trees would have to be sacrificed. Sometimes, nit rarelv. an orchard would 1. ravaged. It in needles to say that for all damage thus lone to property the government unhesitat inglv paid . and paid as it does not often do in ca!i. This fact did not, however, seem to be known to our Cracker friends who sojourned in the county of Starke. One day it happened that the line struck a "dead- enin' " belonging to an agrieuiturist ol mat fertile tract, and went first through his corn field (the corn being about three feet high), and then through a large and thrifty patch of sweet potatoes. The avenue was fifty feet wije the trees foil on all sides. What with the trampling of tbc negroes and the falling of the trees, it may lie readily sur mised' that there were not many corn or potat plants left uninjured through the length and breadth of that atomic. In the midst of that devastation the officer in charcc (a stalwart Kentuckian, now an able and eloquent clergyman) was sitting on the fence tmoking ana calmly surveying the havoc, when to him rode up a youth, bare as to the foet and legs, sunburnt as to the hair, but irate and determined as to the countenance. " Sec hyar, stranger," said he, " this byar won't do '" Won't it?" said I , lmperturba- ,y. Well, if it isn't straight, it's H 'e fault, fr he lined it."

" what Jioald you think tbc damage to your crop is worth 7" J " Dad " stroked his chin gravely. Appa rently an idea found it difficult to come through tbe top-dressing of dirt, bristles acd tobacco-jaice on his unshaven cheeks, fur he trantferred his attentions to his head. " A'a'al, now, cap'n," said he, reflect ively, " you tee ther's a pow'ful heap o' damage done ' Ther's hills o' co'n an' rows otwrs no i mean mils o taters an rows o' eo'n completely nomiwued an' not wuth a durn. Ther's the trouble o' snlitten' all i that thar wood. Wa'al, it's hard tu say." " Name your price," said Y . , "Wa'al, now," hesitating, "djn't be eloHe-fiated about it, cap'n. Kay now shmli you think jifty toils teas fii muck?" Had it been any one of tbe party except Y to whom this exorbitant charge was I made, a roar of laughter that would hare ended in a fight with the irate Cracker would unquestionably have followed this estimate of damages. Even tbc impertur bable Y confessed to me in confidence that he had never before been so tried, lie kept his countenance, however, and calmly replkd " Well, no ! 1 shouldn't think that a dollar was too ranch. But, as we are anx ious that tbe people should be satisfied, I'll give you a couple or dollars and call it square." So saying, be handed four half dollars to the astonished man. " By tbc Lord, stranger '" said that wor thy when he had satisfied himself that this munificence was real, " you're a right bower a full of acw, by gum ! Cum down to the pen it's no use, I won't take no denial cum rite down an' take a drink of old wum- juiee wif mean' the neighbors. An' you, Jack, ride your critter down thar, and take mine wif you. Me'n" the stranger'll foot it." So down Y had to go, and then ?nd j there imbibe villainous new whisky with some ten or a dozen of thin, sunburnt, tobacco-stained, reckless-looking fellows, who ' welcomed him most heartily after hearing 'dad's " story, and who would have as cool- ly shot him in two minutes if taey had been satisfied in their minds that be intended to trample on their rights. . As they parted, " dad " addressed Y . " Stranger." said he, ' every man in Starke conuty'e yer friend , an' if you want j help enny time, 1st Hen Padgett know. An' i if enny man ever sez in mv bearin' that the United States ain't tbc best of rutin's, that man's a-goin tu git his head bruk, or my 1 sinners " (stretching oat an arm where tho muscles looked like ropes. ai,d I've no doubt i - . 1 . .... j lelt uxe iron) " or my sinners nas lost tnar cunnin'." Tbe Cracker's language, a faint idea of which may be gathered from tbe f iregoing anecdotes, is of peculiar construction. He always ' reckons ;" calls tbe earth " the yeath," and ears " years;" utterly disregards the r in corn, and adds the letter h to the Er noun " it." His father is his dad," is mother his "mam." A friend in usually addressed as " hose." A turkey is a " tuck ey ;" a hornet, a " ho'nct." For our friend drops his r's as an Englishman bis A'ti, and puts them in where, according to popular prejudice, tbey do not bebng. A worm is a "worn." a flask is a "tickler." To go over a bill is to go " over the top :" a stone whether small or great a ' rock ;" and women are generally spoken of as " heifers." To these peculiarities of pronunciation and nomenclature add a sort of lazy brawl, and you may obtain some sort of a notion of the Cracker moon ot speeen. Tbe Cracker is independent in his ideas of dress or costume. A lelt bat o! a nondescript color, but once probahly white, a cotton shirt innocent of plaited bosom, starch or , washing, and a pair of homespun or ' hick ory ' trousers stock into his boots, or. more generallv, rolled up about half a foot above low-quartered brogans, and showing an expanse of dirty ankle, complete the attire of tbe man. Tbc woman wears a h imespun gown : 1 cannot posiitirely aver that she does not wear anytbiog else, bat, to the bert of my knowledge and belief, shf nit. Children wear anything or nothing. In fact, children among the Crackers have i but a poor chance. Nature has lier will , with them in so tar as a disregard of the appliances of art is concerned, but she docc not, after all, seem to be so good a mother as some of our modern philosophers would have us suppose. Only the hardiest of the children survive And no wonder.

Tbe poor baby is thus I earlv ramiliar with tne nanus ol nunsrer. io bo sure, huncer is a natural emotion, but one not easy to get a accustomed t . As a consequence of this difficulty the Cracker child eats dirt to satisfy the continual crav ings of his stomach. This unsatisfactory diet gives him a white-washy complexion, and a pleading, wistful look about tbe eyes (which seem to have lost whatever light they dan i Ttitr irmriilftrities r ii frpdini make Cracker children almost uniformly pot- bellied.

Inasmuch as war in Europe and cne)UP&t j demand for money makes it doubtful whether the ' 4 and 5 1-2 percent, baoin will betake:), it .seems to cue wiee to authorize the iwae f three hundred niil!ions additional bund, bearing in- ' tercet a. the rate of five pt-r cent. Tbc interest can be paid quarterly without inconvenience, and 1 the Secretary therefore respectfully recommends the loan act to be so modified, tht payment of interest may be made quarterly, instead of semi-annually. Should the recommendations 1 approveJ by Congress, it ii of grc.it importance that an act authorizing the changes be passed without delay. Complaints are made, that N-l-tional B'nk hilts are worn to such extent as o be no longer fir for circulation, aod as more ctw bonds are to be organized, the Secretary recom mends an appropriation be made, and authority given for the Usue of new bills upon such paper, and in such form aa may b designated by Secre tary of the Treasury. The Secretary aeks the attention f Congress to a bill prepared in the department andaubm:tted at the last session re lative t i the mints and the coinage syalem cf the country.

As bad been expected, the la-gc revenues, however, ,f govern uipnt e. utluuing without material abatement until t!.f present time, improved the credit of i.ic 'ountry and enabled toe Treasurer by weekly purchases to reduce the amount of rarpU- bui.ds oflVred for sale and contributed to depreciate the market Talneofgold.

The opening of the third sesiion ef tfceforty- firtt Congress yesterday, attracted to the Capi tol a crowd of eager spectators, though the oe- casion promited nothing cut cf the ordinary routine, beyond swearing in a few newly elected members and the reading of the President's Met sage. Nothing could have been more charm ing than the day. The skies were at their brightest, and the temperature was just at that point one would wish it to remain always. By eleven o'clock, the galleries of both the Re presentatives Hall and the Senate Chamber were comfortably filled, and before noon densely packed. The lathes usually assert their claim to the pcrtion of the galleries set apart for their especial accommodation, and yeiterday was no exception to this rule. A large numher of Am erican citizens of African descent were present in expectation of the swearing in of Mr. Rainy, the colored member elected to fill the vacancy occasioned by the enforced resignation of B. F Whrttsaore of South Carolina. In this, how ever, they were doomed to disappointment, as he f tiled to make his appearance. In the di pi ora i tic gallery of the Senate sit Mrs, Grant, Mrs. Colfax, ani Mrs. Seaat r Pomeroy. Mr. Thornton, tfce British minis ter, with E i -Secretary Borie, occupied the next seat in front. The lwt hour of the forenoon was occupied with friendly greetings among the members and the floor of either House presented an animated scene. The Democrat; fcea are visibly short ened in view of their recent successes We my look for the utmost good nature ou their part now that they perceive a faint prospect of vic tory in the future. Their rallying cry is evi dently to be free trade," and it may prove a more potent one than we protectionists care to contemplate. At VI o'clock both bodies were promptly called to order. The House of Representatives was becomingly decorous during the opening prayer, but imme diately upon its coacloion resolved itself into a first claaa Bbel, by way of reiwertio; ita claim to be the fioittest legislative body in existence. Tbe credentials of three- nw members were presented, two ot whom after some little opposi tion, were sworn in by the Speaker and admitted to seat. Opposition was ma le to tbe admission of Mr. Duke, the newly elected lemocratic member from Virginia, but after some debate wa with drawn, and he was declared entitled to the seat, hut w is.not present to be sworn. AbuJt half past one o'clock, tbe President's Message was received and reaJ. It appeared fc give very general satisfaction to the Republic meirbeni retSSTLVl!-! .
