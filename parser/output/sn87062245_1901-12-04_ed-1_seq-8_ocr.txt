RALLY AFTER THE MESSAGE Amalgamated Copper Alone Fails to Respond STOCK DECLINES TO NEW LOW LEVEL Presidents Paper Affects Indus trials Favorably Export of Gold Steadios Starling Exchange Re action at

ument produced apparently a reassuring effect and rt all ccnts there was socn after midday a general and material rally in prices -The attitude assumed by the President tpon the so called trust question ap peared to meet with general commenda tion With the present lesson ot the Amalgamated Copper concern In mind the public at large and the Wall Street com munity In particular is quite ready to ap plaud any recommendation that a proper amount of publicity In regard to tho af fairs of the industrial combinations should be enforced by law Itilly of liirciHniIiiir Clrtnictr President

legislation against the trusts although why any such ideas should have been accepted In icw of his solemn as surances upon tbo occasion ot his taking the oath ot oHce is not easy to under stand The position assumed by tho President upon other of the Eevcral great political and financial questions of the time was also decidedly eficctive in giving a more confident tone to the spetulatlon ban it has had for several days The general market opened fairly steady tut It soon relapsed Into the irregularity and weakness which marked yestcrda af ternoons dealings acd a number of stocks broke very badly Cases in point wtre Great Northern St Pnul and Union Pa rlSr all cf which were unfavorably af fected ty the current attacks en the le gality of the formation of tho Ncrchern Securities Company emanating In the Western States and supplemented in other directlccs Selling Ijy Weitlcrii llonncf Western houses continued heav sellers ot these stocks but the largely Increased borrowing demand fcr them In the loan marKet indicated that much of the selling was fcr short account It Is not alone in these stocks howeter ttat an increased borrowing demand appeared for It was evident practically In every direction Other notably weak features of the early dealings were the Vanderbllt stocks which hofffier subsequently recoered rapidly and Texas and Pacific In the industrial quarter the trading was active but a fairly firm tone prevailed there Notwithstanding a further reduction in the price of copper In the London metal market and yesterdays reduction in the dividend on Boston and Monfana stock Amalgamated Copper was for the time being firm It seemed to be the common opinion that about all the untoward developments possible bearing upon this had now been made known and largely on this the ory quite a IUcly covering of short con tracts was conducted Other firm fea tures In this direction were Pacific Mall Tennessee Coal and Iron General Elec tric and Peoples Gas Itnlly Kollovtx the JJcnnjrc The Industrial quarter generally speak ing moved In line with the rest of the market being weak In the forenoon and rallying after the publication of the Pres idents me sage The United States Steel stocks were logically favorably influenced by the recommendations of the Execu tive rtgardlng industrial combinations while Sugar was favorably influenced by the suggestions that the duties Ga Cuban products should be reduced The London market for American stocks did not reflect the unsettlcmont which prevailed at the close here yesterday and In fact was quoted above parity with jesterdays local final prices Foreign liuuses on balance were buy ers hero to a moderate extent Sterling ex change was easier as a nult ot yestcr da s engagements of gold for export and the money market was fairly steady with the bulk of the borrowing en cal effected between 4 and 4 per cent CoiipcrH jVesv Loir Lei pi With the course of the afternoon Amal gamated Copper developed renewed weak ness and declined to the lowest figure the stock has yet attained As was to be ex pected the renewed weakness In Amalga mated checked the improving tendency In the remainder of the market and led to a general reaction There was nothing novel bearing upon the stock and its decline seemed to be owing simply to a fresh outburst of the liquidation which has been conducted in the stock for the past three months

considered to have produced tho cuuuKi m me tone 01 me siock mantel for tho better that occurred yesterday afternoon There had been a dull and sagging market during the greater part of the morning and immediately after the message appeared there was an accession of buying orders which advanced prices fractionally all over the list and during the remainder ot the afternoon this bet terment although in no way remarkable was persistent and unmistakable The better market reflected the general opinion of the message in Wall Street Railway and financial men characterized the document as conservative and yet op timistic and progressive and the position taken by the President on all questions affecting financial commercial and rail way matters seemed to meet with general commendation The ZehKllKc nn the TrnntH Mr Roosevelt recognizes the immense work that the trusts have done in build ing up the prosperity of the country and deprecajeg strongly any haphazard legis lation to obstruct legitimate business growth but advocates in unmistakable tcrmslavte tW giVethe Government the right to know what the great corpora tions ire doing and to inform the public when advisable Wall Street Is not disposed to quarrel with this Many of the most prominent financial and business men have already expressed themselves In favor of just such laws requiring publicity of the trusts Many cf the best of these con cerns have already realized the rights ot their stockholders to have such knowl edge and are at the present time giving It to them in regular periodical state ments It is the general comment that the message and the laws that It may lead to will hurt no company that does not deserve to be hurt hnpervlHlon o Frelclit Itntex The recommandatlon that supervision of railway freight rates be given to the Interstate Commerce Commission and that the commission have the power to enforce its supervision is not unfavorably received by the railway Interests because it Is coupled with a plain intimation that tho railwavs should be allowed to form pool ing arrangements under the direction of the commission Such a compromise be tween the railways and the commission would tc acceptable to both parties it is said The expectation that Mr Roosevelt would favor a subsidy for American ships is fulfilled Wall Street interests almost universally wanC a subsidy bill and arc pleased that the messago openly advo cates such a law The llccliiroclty View Commended Tho conservative commendation of a reciprocity plan which shall not bow ever hurt the effectiveness of the pro tective principle and the recommendation that the revenues of the Government be c irtalled carefully so that a too bulky surplus shall not be piled up in the arc both In accord with the views cf a majority of the financial men and favorable opinions wero expressd yester day afternoon regardlns the paragraphs discussing these subjects lluxicfal 3iifUct OnlnlcuiH The street is hopeful that tho stock market will continue to Improve It is recognized of course that even though the incs3agc is a bull argument there may be other factors affecting the mar ket that will outweigh Its effect Con servative Wall Street people however arc Inclined to the belief that this will not prove to be the case The Immediate financial situation Is not entirely satisfactory but it will Improve If the experts are correct In their views At any rate the outlook Is excellent for legislation in the line of the message that will have a beneficial effect before tbe winter is passed Call money rates were not advanced yesterday s many had pre dicted they would be It said that the banks arc receiving Important remittances of cash Irom the West and South this week The Amalgamated Copper business Is still in evidence but the message leaves room for the plain suggestion that the general market should be allowed to suf fer on account of the possibly rotten con dition of any one concern Railway earnings continue to lncreaso and also the earnings of the Industrial concerns that publish statements of their business and after all has been bald this Is the last and basic argument In favor of a strong stock market Earnings make dividends possible and constantly Increas ing earnings make larger dividends a thing to be expected Orlober nnriilnRs MntemcntM These October earnings reports made yesterday were Important Two of them made an excellent showing and the third a poor showing that was not a surprise The Increase In the net earnings of tho Pennsylvania for the month of October was J367C00 one of tho largest Increases ever made The Increase In the surplus after fixed charges of the Rock Island was 311011 The Burlington surplus after fixed charges for the month showed a de crease of r066l The Burlington Is not

TIMES WASHINGTON ApygSDAY DECEMBER 4 1901 news that there is to bo no change in the rate was not a surprise in conservative quarters Sugar vas fairly strong during the afternoon on the theory that the Pres idents reciprocity Ideas will include a re duction of the tariff on raw sugar from Cuba No direct referenco to the Cuban sugar question is made Uccrcnsc In Conner IlxportM Amalgamated Copper was erratic In tho extreme getting at one time as low as 71 and a fraction a new bottom price and at period of tho day as high as 74 It closed near the bottom however and there seemed to be little support from inside interests The announcement yesterday morning that the Boston and Montana Company one of the Amalga mated concerns had cut Its dividend in half perhaps had something to do with the weakness of the stock Another mat ter not favorable to the stock was tho publication of the Bureau of Statistics figures showing the exportation of cop per lor November to have decreased 11 154031 poijids or J1S09000 Mnnlinttan Ill lo WM l Manhattan was the strong feature of the day with an advance In the last hour to another new highest price on record 133 Nothing new regarding tho affairs ot the company
