THE VERMONT PIIGENIX, BRATTLEBORO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1911 LOST LIFE SKATING Ruth Birch, II, Drowned In Con necticut River Sunday Joseph Lemere Saved from Similar Fate Thin Ice Broke Beneath Children Difficult Rescue Work. Skating on thin Ice cost the life of rtuth Idella Ulrch, 11, Sunday afternoon about 2 o'plock and only by a narrow margin was Joseph Lemere, 10, saved from a similar fate, while two other per sona took 'Icy baths In attempting to save the chlldten. The accident happen ed In tho Little river branch of the Con necticut, east of the old red barn on tho Island, and although several men and boys were In that locality at the time several minutes elapsed before plans for rcscuo could be formulated and by that tlmo the Ulrch girl had sunk below the surface und when the body was recov ered about 25 minutes later, efforts at resuscitation were unavailing. Two weeks ago tho children who live on the Island began playing on the Ice and desplto the fact that they had been driven off several times, they persisted. About 2 o'clock Sunday afternoon Uuth lllrch, who had on skates, with her brother, Norman, about seven years old, and Joseph Lemere, 10, went on the Ice. Tho two boys were without skates and amused themselves by sliding. Near the shore the Ico was thick enough to hold them, but Ruth and Joseph gradually worked their way out where It was thinner. When about 100 feet from shore the Ice suddenly gave way nnd the chil dren were thrown Into the water. They uttered no outcry and It probably was about a minute before Charles Oakes, George O.ikcs and Ralph Oakes, who were taking In the floats used at their landing last summer, noticed the chil dren struggling In the water. Ruth was farthest from shore and after holding on to the Ice a few moments went down, arose to the surface and went down again. She did not come to the surface a second time. The Lemere boy clung to a plank that was frozen In the Ice. Norman lllrch ran to the lllrch home, about 200 feet away, and told his broth ers and sisters that the children had fal len in and they hurried to the shore, Harold Oakes started out on the Ice to rescue the children, as did Raymond, Albert nnd Klmcr Birch. Albert fell In to tho water and was nsslsted out by Harold Oakes. The latter had a rope and had proceeded about "5 feet out upon tho Ice when he threw It. As he did so tho ico cracked beneath him, then broke and let him Into the river. 4 By resting his elbows on the Ice he kept his head and shoulders above water and was pulled back upon thick Ice by George Oakes and Elmer Birch. H was not possible to reach the chil dren by walking on the Ice and Charles Kblilghausen, who had seen the accident from his home beyond the covered bridge, ran to the river, chopped loose a ho.it that was frozen In the Ice, and he and Alonzo Frazer started after the children. By standing In the stern of the boat and then forcing the bow down, a channel was broke through the ice to the open water and about 20 minutes from the time the Lemere boy fell into the river ho was pulled Into the boat. He was carried to his home near the pavilion on the Island, where he was cared for by Dr. C. R.. Al drich and Dr. Thomas Rice. About 10 minutes later Ruth's father. John 51. Ulrch, who was In the boat, recovered his daughter's body in about 10 feet of water. Dr. Henry Tucker had nrrlved ly the time the body was recovered and although efforts were made to resuscitate the girl they were not successful. Mrs. Birch, the child's mother, was visiting relatives In Vlneland, N. J., and wan notified by telegraph of the accident. This was the first time In IS years that she had been away from her family and on receiving the news started Immediate ly for Bratleboro. The train was 30 min utes late Monday night Into Springfield and the train which arrives here at 10.25 p. m., had left the station. She told the conductor of tho train of the sudden death of her daughter nnd within a few minutes a special train consisting of an engine and a passenger coach was made up at Springfield, the authorities ordered the lino cleared, and orders were given the Montreal express to wait In Green field until tho special arrived there. The train with Mrs. Birch as the sole passen ger made fast time Into Greenfield, -where Mrs. Birch was transferred t the express. Ruth Idella Birch, 11, was born In Put ney Sept 3, 1900, and was a daughter of Mr and Mrs. John M. Birch.

ROOT, Druggist, Brattleboro, Vt. STUFFED THE JAIL LOCKS, Loula Crone, Formerly a Police Court Figure In This County, Locked In Cell In Plttsfield, Mass, In order to express his dUpleasure at being nrrested, Iouls Crone, who was well known In police circles In Brattle boro 10 years ago, plugged nil tho locks In tho police station house In Plttsfield, Mass,, Sunday morning with wet paper, causing tho officers a lot of trouble. He was arrested on complaint of tho Pownnt (Vt.) police, who said he was wanted on a charge of larceny, nnd he Is being held for trial on the charge of vagrancy, his case being continued Mon day for one week. On the night of Feb. 13, 1901, when E. S. Hall was chief of the Brattleboro police force, a telephone mes sage to Mr. Hall from Keene stated that Ixiuls Crono was there with a horse and sleigh, that he acted suspiciously, and that ho admitted having a checkered career and said he was wanted In Ver mont. Half an hour later E. A. Kcnncy of Guilford drove to Brattleboro and asked Chief Hall to hunt up Louis Crone, who had driven nway with Ken ney's horse. Crone had been employed by Kcnney In Wcatherhead hollow. On being sent with the horse to a black smith shop he had skipped with the outfit. His home was In Halifax. Chief Hall and Mr. Kenney went to Keene the following Saturday and Crone returned with them. Being held under bonds of $1000 by Justice W. S. Newton he was taken to Newfane Jail and at the March term of court he pleaded guilty to tho charge of horse stealing, pre ferred by State's Attorney George A. Weston of Bellows Falls, and was sen tenced to not less than four years and not more than five years at hard labor In the state prison In Windsor. He was then 23 years old and said he had served a term In the house of correction for breaking Into a house In Halifax and had been imprisoned In Concord, Mass., for rape. Recenty Crone has lived In Pownal. He went to Plttsfield Saturday to see n prisoner in the house of correction. Shortly before noon the Plttsfield police were naked to be on the watch for him. He was found at the house of correc tion by an officer of whom he had asked the way, but who at that time did not know that Crone was wanted. When searched all the articles In his clothing were taken away except some tobacco In a paper bag. Ho was locked up and later when the olllcers undertook to lock up another prisoner they found that every lock In the place had been stuffed with wet paper, even the Yale lock on the padded cell. Crone denied that he stuffed the locks, but he was the only prisoner having the run of the cell room. He was divested of his last scrap of pa per and locked In a cell. PAROCHIAL SCHOOL NOTES.

Fairbanks company of St. Johnsbury has Just completed 14 automatic elevator scales for the mam moth grain elevator the Canadian gov ernment Is erecting In Montreal. These scales are probably the largest scales In the world and already several of them have been completed though none of them have, as yet, been Installed. Ten of these scales will each weigh 10,000 pounds of grain per minute and four will each weigh 12,000 pounds per minute. The scales are being built at the Sher brooke factory where a special building had to be erected on account of the large size of these scales. The company has Invented n freight dial scale, which will be Instantaneous In weighing and the weight will be shown on a large dial, Instead of being taken on n beam, and experiments are being made on several other new Ideas. A represent atl e of the company arrives this week from n trip to Germany, Russia and Aus tla, which is expected to result In in creased orders from those countries. Russia Is one of tho largest foreign users of the Fairbanks scales In the wotld, Seveial new buildings have been erected In the last year and the outlook was never better than now. An expert In scientific management has been In specting the factory to give advice as to certain changes which It Is thought will udd to the elllcieney of the St, Johnsbury plant and put the work on a scientific basis. New nnd up-to-date machinery will be purchased and some of the old will be rearranged. It Is also the plan to have the work so nrranged that It will be either day pay or ple-ce, und the Jobber will be eliminated In a short time. Opening of Congress.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Let the Anti-Trust Law Alone, Is His Advice to Congress Suggests Supplemental Legislation and Favors an Act Describing Unfair Com petition. President Taft's third annual message to Congress, presented on Tuesday, deals exclusively with the Sherman anti-trust act and tho trust question In general. The President defends tho Sherman act ns Interpreted by the Supreme Court of tho United States, Indicates plainly his opposition to the repeal or amendment of this statute, but suggests that Congress pass a federal Incorporation law and sup plemental legislation that "would describe and denounce methods of competition that are unfair. To supervise corpor ations chartered under federal law, Presi dent Taft proposes tho creation of an ex ecutive bureau, or commission, with powers akin to those of the Interstate commerce commission. Speaking of the dissolution of the to bacco trust, tho President declares that In his opinion "not In the ,hlstory of American law has a decree more effec tive for such a purpose been entered by a court." Mr. Taft renews his recom mendations for tho enactment of a gen eral law providing for the voluntary formation of corporations to engage In trade and commerce among the states and with foreign nations. It Is moro manifest now that the denunciation of conspiracies In restraint of trade should not, nnd does not, mean the denial of organizations large enough to be In trusted with our Interstate or foreign trade. It has been made more clear that a purely negative statute like the anti trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate national and foreign commerce. "The attempt and purpose to suppress a competitor by underselling him at a price so unprofit able as to drive him out of business, or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they are required to give up associations with other manu facturers and numerous kindred methods for stilling competition nnd effecting monopoly, should be described with sulllclent accuracy In a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the govern ment to shorten Its task by prosecuting single misdemeanors Instead of nn entire conspiracy, and, on the other hand to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business community what must be n voided." Mr. Taft does not attempt to set forth the detnlls of the federal Incorporation act he recommends, but suggests that combination of capital nllowed to become federal corporations should be subject to rigid rules us to organization and pro cedure, Including effective publicity, nnd to the "closest supervision" as to stock nnd bond Issues by the proposed execu tive bureau or commission in the com mep'e and labor department. Federal Incorporation, the President declares, would not exempt any concern or Its olll cers from prosecution under the Sherman act for Illegal nets. Such an act, could be framed so ns to prevent "vexatious and unnecessary Invasion by the states" but yet permit control by the states with respect to purely local business. The courts should be empowered, the President says, to Invoke the aid of the burenu of corporations In determining the mltable reorganization of corporations dissolved by decrees. This work, he points out, might be Intrusted to the pro posed supervisory commission which "should be nn executive tribunal, of the dignity and power of the comptroller of the currency or the Interstate commerce commission." Accompanying the message Is nn ap pendix showing trust prosecutions Insti tuted by all administrations since the enactment of the Shcrmnn net In 1S90. According to this nppendlx seven suits were brought under this act In the ad ministration of President Harrison; eight In Mr. Cleveland's second'term; three un der President McKlnley; 44 under Mr. Roosevelt In about "& years, and 37 so far, In the Taft administration. Other messages on various subjects, the Presi dent says will be sent to Congress from time to tlmo before the usual holiday re cess.
