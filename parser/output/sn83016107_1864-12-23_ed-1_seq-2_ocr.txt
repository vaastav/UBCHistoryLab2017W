The anniversary of another Christmas is near at hum). With what lively feelings of pleasure and delight do all Christian nations hail the an nual return of this day, made memorable by the birth of the Saviour of the world, and which has for nearly two thousand years been observed as a dav of festival bv the Christian Church, in - * I memory of the nativity of the Redeemer. As to the antiquity of this festival, says an eminent au thor, the first footsteps we find of it are in the second century, about the time of the emperor Commodus. The decretal epistles, indeed, carry it up a little higher, and say that Telcsphorus, i who “lived, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, or dored divine service to be celebrated, and an an- j gelical hymn to be sung, the night before the na- i tivity of our Saviour. However, that it was i kept before the lime of Constantine, we have a i melancholy proof, fur whilst the persecutions I raged under Diocletian, who then kept his court ut Niconii'diu, that prince, among other acts of cruelty, finding that multitudes of Christians as-I scmbled together to celebrate Christ's nativity, ! commanded the ehurcb-doors, where they were 1 met to be shut, and fire put to it, which, in a short time, reduced them and it to ashes. Eighteen hundred and sixty-four years have j passed, siuce the same stars which will look out upon the world to-morrow night, witnessed on the ! plains of Judea the astonishment with which the ! watching shepherds received the annunciation of j the Heavenly messenger of “good tidings of great joy,” “for unto you is born this day iu the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” Though the soul has been made joyous by the remembrance of the atoniug Mood of a Saviour, yet to us the joys and pleasures attendant upon each return of Christmas, is in some degree sad dened by the recollections of the distracted con dition of our country. But may we not hope, that on the next return of the Saviour's natal i morn, the angel voice which nearly twenty centu-1 ries ago aroused the shepherds of the Holy Land, | may again he heard, as on that memorable day, j proclaiming to a peaceful and contented world, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth pence, good will toward men?” It is not to 'the Christian alone that the ad- j vent of this dly brings joy and gladness; but the grave, the gay, the old and young alike hail with emotions of delight and satisfaction the yearly return of Ibis testive season. What hopes swell the bosom of childhood, as at each Christ mas eve the little one hangs his or her stocking’ beside the fireplace, there to await the coming of Santa Claus; with what eager anxiety is the couch vacated at early dawn, to examine the gifts of the bounteous psfbu of childhood, and with what pleasure and hurried motion does the i recipient trip away with the well filled stocking, to exhibit to all who desire to sec the generosity 1 of the good old Saint, who on that night left his j far-off home in the north star, to gladden the I hearts of his little friends. 'This theme is replete with marvelous interest, and yet we enjoy the millions of blessings with which we are surrounded, with scarcely a thought of the source from whence they come. Let those who on this occasion are surrounded with an j ftbundauce of the good things of this world, in their eagerness and anxiety io enjoy themselves and render happy their immediate friends, not for get that the naked need raiment, and the hungry ■wherewith to sustain life, and that there are hun dreds of thousands, ou this very day of general festival, that misfortune has driven forth to seek from the cold charities of the world the means of ft scanty subsistence. Let us hope and believe that the radiant light of the next Christmas morn will beam upon all hearts with the keen reality of it “Saviour born,” and that the lamp of be nevolence will he carried into many of the dark and cheerless abodes, where the sunlight of bounty has never entered. —ib* .. * WAR HEWS. Gen. Foster reports to ihe War Department that on Wednesday he had a personal interview with Gen. Sherman at Fort McAllister, which had been captured on the preceding day. Sa vannah was closely besieged, and its surrender in two days demanded. If not complied with, Gen. Sherman intended opening his batteries upon the city. Its fall was expected. The con dition of the Union troops is represented to be good, having been but feebly resisted, and well provided, during their march through Georgia. Notwithstanding the retreat of Forrest from before Nashville, Gen. Lyon continues his block ade of the Cumberland river. He has captured and destroyed the steam*rs Ben Soult and Echo. After vigorously conscripting the inhabitants in and around Eddyvilic, he proceeded in the di rection of Carnrille, and it was supposed, would ! attempt to blockade the river at that point also, j Gen. Thomas reports to the War Department, in a despatch dated near Spring Hill, Tennessee, ! ihal Hood's army had been vigorously pursued | ou Sunday, and two or three hundred more pris- j oners taken. The enemy avoided any attack by the Union troops. At au early hour on Monday morning the pursuii was to have been continued. The railroad has been but little damaged. A number of the enemy’s wounded have been found in the houses along the roadside, among them was Brigadier General Quarles. An unofficial despatch from Nashville, contained in the bullet in, says that yesterday morning the rains were so heavy that little progress has been made. The I Union cavalry had skirmishing with the enemy south of Spring Hill, and discovered that Forrrst was in command. Geo. Beauregard reports the capture of Fort McAllister by Sherman. The Richmond Send - \ nel supposes that Sherman will now address him- j self, for a time at least, to the siege nf Savannah. The Sentinel does not expect he will lake it, hut : orgues that if he docs, he will merely have ex-1 changed a city in the interior for a city on the! mil. Gen. Burbridge had a fight last Tuesday at j i Kingsport, Tenn., with Basil Duke’s brigade, | formerly John Morgan’s, and routed it. The en emy lost 150 killed, wounded and prisoners. A brother of John Morgan was captured. It is stated that the Roanoke river is full of torpedoes. Besides the Otsego, the steamer Bag ley and picket launch No. 5 have been destroyed by them. One man and a boy were killed on board the Bagley. The officers and the rest of | ] the crew saved themselves by swimming. Capt. j Ames and Paymaster Sands were rescued by the Wyal using. All the Federal outposts in Middle Tennessee, southeast of Tullahonia, are reported to have i been evacuated. Northern Georgia is also rep resented to be entirely free of Federal troops. President Lincoln has called for another draft of three hundred thousand men to make up the i deficiencies occasioned by credits on the last call. Havana advices of the 14th, per steamer Lib erty, report the arrival of the blockade runner Dundy, on her tenth pip from Galveston. The rebel Generals Marmaduke, Cabell and Gordon, passed through Boston on Monday to Fort Warren. A despatch from Nashville, dated Monday says that Gon. Thomas is pursuing the enemy to Duck river, and has captured sixty-four pieces of artillery and nine thousand prisoners, inclu ding the three thousand wounded at Franklin, and four major generals. Nearly all the church es and public buildings in Franklin have been taken for hospital purposes. Forrest is reported to have made another attack on Murfreesboro’, and to have been repulsed by dens. Rosseau and | Milroy. Gen. Dana has issued an order by which all I exemptions from military duty heretofore gran ! led in the district of West Tennessee, will be void after the Ist of Jan. next, and all persons be ! tween the ages of eighteen and forty-five, claira j ing exemption from any cause, must make prop- I er proof and procure certificates before that date. New Orleans dates of the 16th inst., have been received. Advices from the blockading squad | ron off Galveston, report the seizure during the week ending the Oth instant, of six blockade run ners. Yellow fever is raging at Galveston, and | the mortality is very great, j General Dix has transmitted an order author | izing the raising of a new regiment of cavalry in ] New England, designed for frontier service.— I One batallion of 400 men is to be recruited in ! Massachusetts. A Canada despatch says ; It is reported that the raiders who went East have been arrested.— A proclamation has been issued offering a reward for their arrest. Much excitement exists in refer ence to the order calling out the militia, and there are large nuuihcis of volunteers. Reports are afloat of intended outrages by the Federals. The Snow Hill (Md.) Sitield states that Gener al Lockwood, while recently at New Town, in | that county, levied a sum of about 

SI,OOO upon j those within a range of five miles ol that village I who had been designated as rebel sympathizers [ The object of the levy was to rebuild a colored Methodist meeting house w Inch t ad recently been | fired by incendiaries and destroyed, j A despatch from St. Louis says :—The loss to steamers by moving ice in the harbor yesterday was over $200,000. The insurance is about $5,000. >- A single ’box of Brasdreth’s Pills contains mote vegetable extractive mutter than • twenty boxes of any pills in the world besides; fifty-five hundred physicians use them in their practice to the exclusion of other purgatives.

Let those who know them speak right out in their favor. ! It is a duty which will save life. Our race arc subject to a redundancy ofvitin | ted bile at this season, and it is dangerous ns it is prevalent; but Brandrcth’s Pills afford an in valuable and efficient protection, Tiy their occa sionnl use wo prevent the collection of those im purities, which, when in sufficient quantities, cause so much danger to the body’s health.— j They soon cure liver complaint, dyspepsia, loss of appetite, pain in the head, hearl-bnrn, pain in the breast-bone, sudden faintness and eostiveneis.

Something Cuiuohs.—A few days since Mr. K. 11. liutler, of this city, dis ! interred from one of our grave-yards the [ body of a female, which presented a re- I markable spectacle. The interior of the corpse was almost perfectly hollow, for miog a shell. The flesh was converted into a stony substance of a white orslravv j iah color, by petrifaction or some other ] I process, aud it required the united strength J jof several men to lift the inanimate mass. ! [ The ground in which the corpse had been ! I buried was of a slato formation mingled | with lime stone. This seems to us to he i ian interesting subject for the attention of f naturalists.— Cumberland {Md. ) Union. j The Democracy. Now, we of the Democracy derive a j "real deal umre comfort from the elections than oar Republican neighbors. “Not to j put too lino u point upon it,’’ it was real I iy a triumph for the Democracy—nothing 1 mom, nothing less, atrl we think we can prove our position. The Democracy held one hope that in electing their eamihlale, I am) then pursuing a conciliatory ami con stitutional policy, they might possibly suc ceed in restoring the Union by peaceable means, never having much faith in accom t pllshing that fact hy the arhilranicnt of, the sword. If they had failed so to do by I conciliation, us it is now none than likely they would, then the party would have ut- j terly and irrevocably “gone under,” and been a thousand times worse off in power 1 than out. The spoils of office would have been a poor consolation in such a dilem ma. The chances, in fact, were really against I the Democracy being able to restore the Union by the time they could get a.ces sion to power in March next. Let ns sup pose the Democracy to have been success ful, following out the line of argument.— The first step doubtless would have bei n a convention of Slates; of course the aboli tion Stales would be repiesnled no 1 1 would streiiousiy oppose all compromise 1 1 on the basis of the old Union and the old : Constitution Instead, thereforo, of its being a harmonious convention, as it un doubtedly would have to be, to effect, any important or definite result, it would break up in “confusion worse confounded.” In such an emergency there would he left to the Democratic party but one of two cour-1 308 to pursue—wo should have to continue ; the war, or, recognize the Southern Con federacy. Recognition would he a danger j ous and most hazardous movement; whilst j ! to continue the war would even more sure- | ily kill off the party We should have a ] I ruined currency to begin with, too; and the moment a Democratic administration attempted to carry on the war, the entire j opposition would become a peace party ; 1 so that with the elements olSlisaffuetion in our own ranks, the united hostility of the opposition, and a worthless currency In j boot, we do not see how the Democratic | party could bo otherwise than in a most I disagreeable condition The election of Mr. Lincoln has saved | us from this dilemma, and we for one can look upon the fact with very great com | posure. This war is a tremendously large ; elephant, and we do not care about assum ing any responsibility incident to the : care of the animal. The Democracy, as a party, are in no wise responsible! for its continuance. That responsibility is upon the should*rs cf the Republican puny, and they will at some future day be held accountable to the people. For these reasons, therefore, we bold that the recent election was by no means a Democratic de feat. if the Republican party can stand the re-election of Lincoln, tire Democratic | parly certainly have no reason to bo great ly dissatisfied under the very peculiar cir cumstances of the case. —Bergen Demo crat. — Prohibition Duty on Printing Paper.—The New York Pouf and Jour nal J Commerce are discussing the lugli duty on news printing paper, an article the estimates of which for the use of the Gov ernment printing office in Washington alone is 8600,000. The present duty., like a good many others, is a prohibitory ( I one, and of course without any benefit, to the Treasury or the public. , The Post j rotoaiks : The duly on printing paper was, we! suppose, intended hy those who laid it to i produce revenue to the treasury. Its only effect, however, is to put money into the poeke's of the American manufacturers.— T he duty is twenty per cent, ad valorem ; this is payable in gold, and it has made | importation impossible. It does this in ! the following way : The imaiufaeturers of printing paper here set their prices so as to leave no mar ; gin of certain profit to the importer who \ must pay a duly of twenty per cent, in j gold ; at the same tin e their profits emi ahle them, if necessary, to undersell anil drive out of the market with loss any one who should attempt to import, i Printing paper sold for from nine to ten I cents per pound before the war. it is sold for eight, cents per pound in Europe at this lime. Rut. in tins coumry publish- j | ers are forced to pay for news paper from i twenty to thirty cents. Take off the duly, 1 and it can he imported for from seventeen to eighteen cents per pound, currency ; j and at that price American manufactureis can still make and sell at a fair profit. A duty which yields no revenue is an übsur dity. .The picsent twenty per cent, duty I upon paper is prohibitory ; its only use is j ; to take money out of the pockets of the 1 public and put it into the pockets of a few already wealthy manufacturers. Even the government pays tribute, under pre-gut ar-1 | rangeiiiLiits, to these capitalists for (he immense quantity of paper it uses. The present Congress ought to- remedy this j wrong by repealing the duty on paper. —■— Change of Time Table.—On and af ■ ter Monday next an important change takes i ■ place iu the time of starting the trains on , the Philadelphia, Wilmington and- Haiti more Railroad.
