precipitate even more pitiful scenes than those of today, with hysteria in all of Its devious forms rampant among the popu lace. Precautions hare already been taken to prevent these harrowing mani festations of grief, but there is little hope that they Vlll avail. The rescuing parties penetrated mine No. 6 about .'i..ViO feet before they came upon the first of the dead. A majority of the corpses will, it is believed, be found about a mile further back. Effects of Explosion. It is hardly possible that all the IxxHes will be recovered for several da>s. The men were wroklng in a territory one mile square. It will be days before a thorough search of all of this area can be made. As the rescuing parties advance they must clear away the debris. The explosion wrecked over ?!00 mine cars and these choke the entries on all sides. Many heavy brattices were also demol ished. A peculiar and remarkable fea ture is that notwlthstand ng the force of the explosion, very little ot the m'ne roof was wrecked. By those who witnessed It the explosion was likened to the discharge of a cannon. Every movable object shot with terrific force through the mine. At the entrance of mine No. S a concrete power house was completely demolished. A piece of concrete weigh.ng fuily 1.0?K) pounds was blown clear across the West Fork river, landing on the side of a hill. In a radius of half a mile not another piece of concrete ran b-? found. Gr*at holes were torn in the hill on either side of the entrance of No. S. Mine cars were crushed as though mad" of paper, and the huge steel tipple was blown apart. On ail sides electric light wires were thrown to the ground, anil many persons narrowly escaped death from these In th? rush for the mine, following the explo sion. The Fairmont and Clarksburg Traction Company's cars "pass within ten yards of the mine entrance, and a- large car crowded with passengers miraculously es caped being blown into the West Fork river. All the passengres were sttinned by the terrific concussion. Fifty Physicians. Thf mine officials state that 40 per cent o." the victims are Americans. Fifty physicians are at or near th? mines attertdlng members of the rescuing party, many of whom have been over come and needed medical attention, and rrady to succor any who may be brought frooi U.e depths of the mine alive. T!u company has rent rush orders for coffins to Pittsburg, Zanesville and other towns, the total number ordered being 40<> up to this time. Gov. Dawsen of West Virginia notified the company's officers that he had wired Ch;ef Mine Inspector Paul of Charlestown to the scene, and that he would arrive at Monong&h this morning. The governor also said that if he could be of any assist ance In any capacity he would be glad to do anything within his power. Accident Due to Gas. It Is stat?l that eighty bodies have been located. It was the Intention to bring these bodies to the surface earlf today, but inadequate facilities, owing to the force of the explosion, prevented this. C. W. Watson, president of the Consoli dation Coal Company, dictated the follow ing statement to the Associated Press: "The accident Is deplorable from any standpoint. It was entirely unexpected. As yet we do not know the exact cause cf the explosion. "It might have resulted from a fclown out shot igniting a pocket of gas. About fiO per cent of the mine accidents or the country are caused in this manner. It is probable the present one resulted from the same cause. We will conduct a rigid Investigation. Investigations, however, will not benefit the dead miners. Their fami lies will be looked after. The company Will bury all the dead. Every facility within the power of the company is being extended to all newspaperman In order that the general public may be accurately Informed as to the disaster. We have hothlng to conceal and are pleased to give whatever information we can." Saloons All Closed. All saloons In Monongah have been Closed since the explosion, and the 6,000 miners employed In other mines In the vicinity have suspended work and ten dered their assistance to the rescuing part lee. Shortly after midnight Are broke out in the main entry of No. 6 mine, and delayed reeclie work several hours. It wks due to starting a fan, and did little damage. It Is expected free access will have beeij gained to all sections on both mines by 6 o'clock this evening. The property loss Is estimated at $50,000, exclusive of the cost of rescue work. 1,000 Ken Employed. The mines are located on opposite sides of the West Fork river, at this place, but Merfed In their underground workings by a heading and on the surface by a great steel tipple and bridge. The two mines regularly employ 1,000 men, working in two shifts. 300 during the day and 600 during the night, and the best information obtainable Is that the entire day force had gone to work this morning and that all were caught. With in an hour after the explosion relief par ties. composed of brave, experienced men, were at work. Superintendent John Brannon of the shaft mine at No. 8 head ed the first relief party. He had ten men with him. Charles Price, one of the men In that corps, was overcome by fire damp and had to be brought out. He narrowly escaped with his life. Cause of Explosion. There is much speculation as to the cause of the explosion, but the most gen erally accepted theory Is that It resulted from black damp, scientifically known as methane. It is believed that a miner at tempted to set off a blast, which blew out and ignited an accumulation of this dead ly gas. and that this. In turn. Ignited the coal dust, a highly Inflammable substance found In greater or less quantity in all West Virginia mines. However, alt ex planations of the oause up to this time are necessarily speculative. Only a thor ough Investigation after the mine is re opened will disclose the cause, If it is ever ascertained. The explosion afTected both mines, and so far as now known appears to have done about as much damage In one as in the other. It has not been established in which mine It originated. Evidencing the terrific force of the concussion, props in the entry of No. 6 mine supporting the roof were not only shattered and torn from their position, but were blown out of the entry and to th? opposite side of the river. Other evidence of the awful force Is shown In every section of the mines that has been reached by the res i-uers. Huge quantities of coal and rock liave been loosened and hurled Into every opening, and all of the underground struc ture Is wrecked beyond semblance of Its original shape. Headings Cut Off. The entry of No. ft mine, 30) feet from the mountain. Is piled high with wreck age of two strings of cars and two elec tric motors. Some of The rescuers have climbed over this and found dead bodies beyond, but have made no attempt to re move these to the surface, partly because It would be almost impossible to carry Uie bodies over the debris, but more particu larly because they do not want to lose any time in reaching other sections of the mine where it is possible men still living may t>e imprisoned. The cars are being righted as fust as possible and removed from the entry, together with all other obstructions. ? All of the headings loading off from the main entry are being cut off by canvas and barricaded as ffust as they are reached by the relief workers, so that ttie inner most workings of the mine may be given the benefit of the ventilating system to sustain any that may be yet living and make possible an early exploration of these workings. The American miners of the town have been placed In charge of the rell?f work, but the Italians and other foreigners are working under them most faithfully. It ?s impossible for a man to remain long in the depths of the mine, and ttie rescue forces are divided to work in relays, with frequent reliefs. Many In the relief party have already become exhausted and been sent to the surface. The Town of Honongah. Monongah Is a mining town In Marlon county, W. Va.. about six miles routh west of Fairmont. It has a population of about 6,000, most of whom are foreigners, although there is a larger proportion of American miners In this district than In most of the other bituminous fields.

TOLL OF THE PIT* In the number of lives lost In mining operations the year 1907 has been the most disastrous on record. Up to December 5 the list of deaths by mine accidents stood at 1.499. With the Monongah figures added the total for the year will approach a.000. Deaths In mine disasters Ih 19W, when 1,219 were killed In one act at Courleres, France, totaled only 1,600. Since 1S5G the average number of deaths by accidents In mines has been 1.000 a year. The years in which the average has been ex ceeded by over 1.000 have been 187*. tvhen 1 .fl.'f miners were killed; 1889. with a death list of 1,110, and 1901, with 1.131 deaths. Safety appliances have kept pace with the increase in the number of miners employed, which has raised the liability of large death lists in single disasters.

Japan, July 22 of this year, when 470 miners met death. were operated almost exclusively by Americans, but during a general strike of miners in the Pennsylvania and Ohio fields many of these West Virginia miners went out in sympathy to prevent the fill ing of contracts at lake ports and else where with West Virginia coal by the companies in Ohio and West Virginia against which the strike was directed. At that time the mine owners brought a large number of foreigners into the field to take the places of the strikers, and ?>ver since the foreigners ihave been dis placing Americans until they are now in the majority. HOME OWNERS PROTEST OBJECT TO CAB LUTE OK NEW JERSEY AVENUE. ? A strong protest against having a car line established on New Jersey avenue, which thoroughfare Is mentioned In the Commissioners' bill to Congress providing for the running of cars to tfte Union sta tion, was made to the Commissioners to day in the form of a written petition signed by Warner 6tutler and Oscar M. Bryant, representing a number of prop erty owners and residents on New Jersey avenue. The petition declares that there is no necessity for the New Jersey avenue route as proposed by the Commissioners. Messrs. fltutler and Bryant said that while the Commissioners Were careful In the preparation of the bill they have not carefully considered the subject, otherwise they would not desire to destroy one of the most beautiful avenues in the city. Nine-tenths of the property owners, they declare, ftre opposed to Having a double track line on what is essentially a resi dential street and that nobody will be benefited except the Street railway cor poration which is bent upon "the ruth less destruction o all the finest north and south streets and avenues." The protestants also called the attention of the Commissioners to the petition, rep resenting 05 per cent of the property own ers along New Jersey avenue, which was presented to the Senate at the last ses sion, when a bill was being considered that provided a car line on this thorough fare, and which petition. It Is said, re sulted in the determined opposition of several senators to having a street car line on New Jersey avenue. "An amendment was accepted by the Senate committee." It is stated, "pro viding for connection with the Union station by coming down Massachu setts avenue from 7th street. Another feasible route, without destroying New Jersey avenue, would be along Florida avenue from 7th street td North Capitol street, thence down North Capitol street to the Union station. Still another route would be from 7th street to 4th street on Florida avenue, ttience over the 4th street line to Massachusetts avenue, and thence to the Union station. Both of these last named routes already have tracks upon them, and each one of them is located from one to two squares from New Jersey avenue." The petition concluded as follows: "ft does seem that the property owners should have some rights in the premises, but it appears that there has been a dis position on the pbrt of the Commissioners to 'railroad' this bill through Congress In spite of the fact that 06 per cent of the property owners are bitterly opposed to the New Jersey avenue extension. It Is only fair to say that these same property owners have never been given a hearing by the Commissioners at which they might offer objections or arguments of any kind, and yet a petition signed by virtually all of them Is now on file In the Senate and a hearing has been requested of the Senate committee having this bill in charge."' The.Commissioners have taken no action on the petition. 

SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERY. Bullets Found at Brownsrille Not From Army Rlflea. The expert analysis of the bullets sub mitted as evidence in the Brownsville Investigation has been completed and the findings sent to the Senate com mittee on 8enate military affairs. It is understood that the analysis shows that the bullets were not the variety in use by the army at the tlmo of the Brownsville riot. Oen. Crotler. chief of ordnance, himself now c0h<iurs Ih the belief that the bullets submitted were not fired from Krac-Jorgensen rifles. The analysis of the bullets, with cor respondence from Oen. Crozier, will be submitted to the committee on military affairs at its meeting Tuesday. The new evidence will without <loubt be wiven rather earnest consideration by all the members, and It may have a great deal to do In shaping the final re port of the committee. New Coin Unsatisfactory. PHILADELPHIA, December 7.?Accord ing to advices today from Washington the government officials are not satisfied with the new gold double eagle which has Just been issued from the mint In this city, and the Treasury has ordered that the coinage of the rtew pieces be discon tinued. Thus far about 123.000 of* the coins have been circulated. The defect is a rough wire edge, due to the extraor dinary pressure necessary to secure the concave effect Which the design calls for. New dies are befng made to eliminate this defect, and coinage will be resumed shortly. The design, which has been pronounced extremely artistic, will not be changed. It is stated that because of the unusual amount of labor required to produce the new coins they are the most expensive ever turaed out In this country. District's Petition for Dismis sal of Application Denied. ACTION OF JUSTICE GOULD Corporation Counsel Given Time to Prepare for Hearing. ME. DAISH TO FILE BRIEF "Friend of Court" Argues for Dis missal of Application for Ascer tainment of Valuation. Justice Gould in Equity Court No. 2 to day denied the petition of the District Commissioners for the dismissal of the application of the Washington Gas Light Company for an ascertainment by the court of the cash value of its plant. At the request of Corporation Counsel Thom as the court allowed him until next Sat urday In which to file the formal answer of the Commissioners to the application. In refusing to dismiss the application Justice Gould said he saw nothing1 un constitutional or incongruous in the act of June A, 1806. He was of opinion, he said, that it is fitting that such power should be Intrusted to the courts, and he knew of no other body to which such power may more properly be delegated. Counsel for the gas company referred to the fact that In the past Congress had frequently authorized the Judiciary to ascertain the cost of extension and additional stock to be issued by railroad companies, and referred to the Seibold case. In 10O United States, 381, where Congress had vested in the Circuit Court the power of supervision of elections. They claimed Congress had the right to ask the court to oonduct the present proceedings, and there was nothing un constitutional In the delegation of such power to the judiciary. Given Leave to File Brief. Justice Gould granted leave to Attorney John B. Dalsh, as "friend of the court," to file a brief In favor of the dismissal of the application. Mr. Dalsh In his brief attacks the constitutionality of the act of June 6, 1?96, and claims Congrpss may not delegate to the judiciary powers at tempted to be given by the act. including the right to ascertain the money value of the plant of the gas company. He cites a number of decisions which appear to bear out his contention. In conclusion. Mr. Daish submits whether or not the duties Imposed by section 5 of the act are of such nature .that a court exorcising the Judicial power of the Constitution can take cognizance of them and whether or not the pending proceeding is a "case" within the meaning of article 3, section 2 of the Constitution. "Should these ques tions be resolved." he says. "In the affir mative, it is then submitted, that the court by regulation distinctly and clearly prescribe the rules for determining the actual cash value of the property, with an eye single to tthe fact that the un earned Increment of this company, as for all other companies, 1? not due to the prudence and foresight of the corpo a tlon. but Is a natural accretion, the cause of which lies beyond the pale of the corporation." At the hearing today Mr. Thomas ap peared for the Commissioners and the gas company was represented by Attor neys R. Ross Perry &. Son, R. H. Golds borough and Lambert & McLean. As sistant United States Atto ney McNamara was not in court, as no government In terest was thought to be involved in the hearing. Argument by Mr. Thomas. Corporation Counsel Thomas In his ar gument lp favor of the dismissal of the petition contended that the function of the court Under section 6 of the act of Juns rt, 189?, is purely ancillary or advisory, particularly In reference to the ascertain ment of the cash value of the plant. All the court Is asked to do, he said, and all the court Is required or a'lowed to do under this section In reference to this matter 1b to ascertain the actual cash value of the plant, tt Is not permitted or requested to render any Judgment or decree. It Is not required to jfess upon any matter of law. It Is simply permitted to find, as a result or a computation, th* actual ca?h value of the company's plant as expressed in currency. What the company does or what use it makes after this information has been obtained, Mr. Thomas said, does not con cern the court. The information may never be used or applied. The stock which is to be based upon the actual cash value of the plant may never be issued The stockholders of the company may refuse lo agrse to the Increase of the cap ital. They are not bound and cannot be bound by any Judgment or deoree of the court In this case to increase the capital stock of the company to an amount equlv a'ent to the actual cash value of the plant. Fails to Show Stockholders' Action. The petition, according to tfie corpora tion counsel, does not set forth that any action whatever has been taken by th? stockholders or directors of the company looking to an increase of Its capital stock. The corporation Itself proceeds to file a petition for the purpose of having the cash value of Its plant ascertained and for Valuation of the costs and expense of future enlargements. It Is not pretended, he said, that the matter has been pre sented to the stockholders at ail, and neither they nor the directors are parties to the proceeding. The only way that the stockholders Of the company could be bound. h? declared, would be through their acquiescence or estoppel by al lowing the Issuing of thi stock after the proceedings were terminated In this case without objection. On the point that the duty Imposed on the court in this Inqulrv is not a Judicial one Mr. Thomas referred to remarks made from the bench by Jpstice Gould when the Georgetown company's applica tion was before the court. These re marks. he said, are a clear Indication that in the Judgment of the court the tea.* companies under this section were entitled to an opinion of the court, and that they were neither required to accept nor follow that opinion, and that It was not binding on them In any way. He submitted that such a law calls for the exercise of no JudlclaJ function and relates to nothing in respect to the exercise of Judicial power. , Judicial Powers of Court. Mr. Thomas then discussed article III. section 1. of the Constitution, relating to the Judicial powers of the court. He con tended that the power proposed to be con ferred by section 5 Is not a Judicial power within the meaning of ttvls seotlon of the Constitution, and !b thei-efore unconsti tutional and cannot lawfully be exercised by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Mr. Thomas cited various authorities which he claimed sustained this conten tion. He then quoted section 2 of the same article of the Constitution, which defines the extent of Judicial power, and contended that If a proceeding Involves a right which In its nature Is susceptible of judicial determination, and If the de termination of it is not simply ancillary or advisory, but is a final and Indisputable basts of action by the parties, It Is a case within the meaning of this provision. The term "case" implies the existence Of pres ent or possible adverse parties, whose con tentions are submitted to the court for adjudication. The present proceeding he claimed, is hot a "Case" Within the mean ing of the Constitution because it lacks necessary elements of the "case," one of which Is a Judgment or decree, and in the matter of this application the action ?f the court is not binding on the parties Numerous authorities, which seem to bear out this contention, were read to the court by Mr. Thomas.

TEST THE EXILING ACTION BY HEALTH OFFICER IN IMPURE MILK CASES. That the health department seems de termined to fight the decision by Judge Mullowny In the Police Court yesterday In discharging defendants in impure milk and cream cases on the ground that In spectors who make the tests are unable to qualify as expert witnesses wa? indi cated today when the case of George B. Farquhar, proprietor of the Belmont dairy 2016 14th street, charged with sell ing impure dairy products, was called. Farquhar was accused of selling cream containing less than the legal amount of butter fat September 17 last. The quality'of Farquhar's stock was tested at the health department by In spector J. C. Hatton, who failed to qual ify yesterday as an expert witness in a similar case. On taking the stand to tes tify as to the quality of the cream Hat ton was subjected to cross-examination as to expert knowledge. The witness was unable to give the chemical composition of butter f*t. the names of acids poured into the product previous to being tested and other similar questions. Judge Mul lowny dismissed the case. Health?Officer Woodward and his as sistant, Dr. I.ynch, appeared in the court with Assistant Corporation Counsel Pugh. The latter noted an exception to the rul ing, and notice was filed that a writ of error will be sought. It was stated that the case will be used as a test and that In all probability pending impure milk and cream oases will be postponed until an opinion la rendered by the Court of Appeals, FORCE AT NAVy"yABD. No Material Reduction Contemplat ed?Matter of Pay. There is said to be some alarm among the thousands of mechanics in the Wash ington navy yard concerning rumors that after the departure of the battleship squadron for the Pacific next week there will be a marked reduction of the force of workers In the naval gun factory, and also that the wage board will recommend a decrease In the ?resent pay of the machinists. The statement is made at the bureau of ordnance of the Navy Department that there will not be any material reduction of force at the Washington navy yard due to the sailing: of the battleships. As to the rumored reduction In pay. It Is said to be based on recent Investigations of the wage board, and its alleged discovery that the mechanics In the yard are receiving more oav than similar artisans within a radius of 100 miles of Washington, and the additional Information that living ex penses have not advanced in the past year. The report of the wage board will not be given out until January 1 next, It was said. NEW REALTY OFFICE. Thomas P. Brown "Established in Southwest Section.

CHICAGO GETS THE CONVENTION (Continued from First Page-) commodatlona and railway facilities were detailed at length. An auditorium to seat 14,000 persons Is building and will be ready by April 115. ... In regard to finances Mr. Mills stated that Denver is not bidding for the con vention against other cities, but it is re alized that necessary expenses must be defravedt and $100000 has been sub scribed to that end. He oromlsed that the delegates and visitors would be roy ally entertained. Lieut. Gov. Harper of Colorado also ad dressed the committee In behalf of Den ver. and pictured the delights of the city in glowing colors. Chicago's Claims Presented. Chicago came next, and her spokes man was Representative Frank O. Low den. He said he would not talk much about Chicago, as every member of the committee knew ali about Chicago. Mr. Lowden said he desired to call atten tion to the fact that the coming con vention promises to be the "only real convention" since 1888?the only one when the action of the convention was not known months in advance. The convention wbuld be attended by from 25,000 to 125.000 visitors. Chicago was nearest the center of population, and it would make a difference to the vis itors In the expenses of the delegates If a more remote city should be se lected. Mr. Lowden pointed out that delegates would be lacking -ailway passes this time, and this reierence raised a sympathetic laugh. Mr. Lowden said that over and above Chicago's wishes were the interests of the republican party. "Forget Chicago," he eald, 'find re member the republican party." Coming to the question of finances. Mr. Lowden said that all which Should be asked of a city would be to defray the necessary expenses of the convention. He doubted If it was for the best in terests of the party to demand more Chicago guaranteed these expenses, the guarantee made by men who made good four years ago, and he would add his personal guarantee to theirs. He ap pealed to the committee to select a city which would be most convenient for the delegates, the visitors and the news papers of the land. Advantages of Kansas City. Kansas City was next called, and Mr. T. 3. Aken took the stand to announce that Senator ".'arner of Missouri would present Kansas City's claim. The Kansas City boomers set up a loud cheer ag Senator Warner advanced. He declared that Kansas City had en" tertained one convention and had mani fested the Industry and .enterprise which warrant tjie promise of making another success. He then went on to praise the great auditorium, which is fireproof, a very Important consideration. He made light of the climatic difficulties that had been raised and claimed that Kansas Cltj was as well oft as Chicago or Denver in that respect. "No man can guarantee the tempera ture," he asserted, '*but I would not give a bawbee for a republican who would not. take a Turkish bath if necessary." Political Considerations. Senator Warner then dwelt at some length upon the political aspect of the proposition, saying that Missouri is a doubtful state and the convention In Kansas City would help the republicans. "Come over now." cried Senator War ner, "and keep Missouri where she be longs, In the republican column. We will give you not promises, we will present to you a certified check for such amount as you may require. And If you come in June, Denver cannot rival us in the mat ter of climate, foj Kansas City is un rivaled In October and June. I would not ask you to come did I not feel that the interests of the republican party and of the nation could be best served by hold ing the convention there." Representative Bartholdt of Missouri, in a flowery speech, announced that the great city of St. Louis had decided to re nounce such claims as It might have to consideration In favor of its smaller sis ter, Kansas City. "We've got the democrats on the run now," cried Mr. Bartholdt. "Give us the convention and we'll have things all our own way. "On behalf of every fighting republican of our state, I appeal to you to let us have the convention." Mr. Neil's Plea. Mr. Jay H. Neff, chairman of the Kansas City delegation of boomers, spoke in behalf of that town, and presented the financial proposition, guaranteeing $75,000, and proffering a certified check on account for $50,000. Up to this time Kansas City's boom was sailing along in fine shape, but Mr. Neff, in his ooncludlng remarks, stuck pins in it. Without any apparent excuse he lugged forth the Roosevelt lyre and began to tune It. .. .,, ._ "Roosevelt owns all the republicans In Missouri,*' he said, "and Bryan all the democrats. Between them they own the state. But Roosevelt is the only man who can poll democratic votes In Mis souri." And Mr. Neff contributed a lot more of the same sort. While the other Kansas City boomers began to look un happy and a number of national commit teemen started to bite their fingernails.
