SATURDAY. Dl.C 12, ls'Kj. FROM WASHINGTON. OPENING OF CONGRESS An Extra Session Certain. TO CHECK FOREIGN IMMIGRATION. The Representative from Kansas. ( KroMi Oar Regular Correspondent l Washington, Dec. 7, lv Speaker Reed's "the* House will please be in order" at noon to-day an? nounced the opening of the last ses? sion of tlie fifty-fourth Congress. Every seat was not filled, but more than a quorum of the House was in attendance. Ditto the Senate The principal business of the first day was the allegea listening to the reading of the President's message. Under the most favtirable conditions, ther > are few member" of either Hemse who real ly listened to the reading of the mes? sage, because they all have printed copies of it, but to-day, when they all knewthat the recommendations of the message will not amount to a row or pins as a factor in influencing legi**'*> tion, there was scarcely a pretense of listening. There are many points of resemblance between the mesaage and that sent to Congress one year ago? the same ideas are stated in different language. While none of the numerous republi? can Senators and Representatives who have recently been to Canton are scili ing to quote President-elect McKin? ley to that effect, their general manner of talking leave not the slightest doubt that an extra session of Con? gress will be callen! together within a few weeks after the inauguration, to pass a tariff bill, regardless of whether this session passed any revenue legis? lation or not. MR. 

HANN' AT THK HELM. Chairman Mark Hanna has no reason to complain of any lack of at? tention since his arrival ia Washing? ton, to make the start on the prepara? tion for the inauguration. lnde*ed. it is fair to suppose after seeing ihe crowds which are al*ays around him? he sees all callers?that he would be just as well pleased with less atten? tion. General Horace Porter, of Ne** York, who will be Chief Marshal of the inaugural parade, is one of Mr Hanna's constant companions and as? sistants lt ia regarded as about set? tled that the inaugural Hall will be held in the beautilul, new Library building The substitute for the House Immi? gration Bill, which provides that no immigrant shall be itdniitted who ia unable to read live lines of the United States Constitution in some printed language, is the "unfinished business" of the Senate and as such has the right of way in that branch of Congress. The bill is in charge of Senator Lodge, who expresses confidence that it will pass. There seems no logical reason for opposing it Certainly no man who is so illiterate as to be unable td read in any language can be a de? sirable accession .o our county. TO DBFKAT A SENATOR. ator Dubois, Of Idaho, isn't half as sure that he will be re-elected to the Senate as some other people have assumed to be. He said on the sub? ject: "These friends who have been saying that I would certainly be re? elected don't know anything of the *-it uation. It ia the democrats who are bothering me. They have united with the populists anl are engaged in a still hunt for an original silver man to rep? resent them in the Senate." And, while Senator Dubois didn't sav so. it is evident that he fears they will find the man they are hunting for. There is no truth in the statement that the Republican National Committee is trying to prevent the re-election of Senator Dubois, to punish him for bolting the St Louis Convention. Representative Rlue, of Kansas, who has made more of a name for himself than most members do in their first term, and who was a victim of the pope?democratic combine, presents this word picture of the elements that carried his state this year: "The lead? ers of the populists in Kansas are at heart socialists?every one of them. and they welcomed Bryan's candidacy because they believed it waa in its es? sence socialistic, as indeed it was. The unrest and discontent in this country and Europe are bett manifestations of socialism. THB BRYAN FOLLOW IN Ci. Every man who had failed in his profession or business, whose life had been unsuccessful, was on Bryan's ?ide; so were those who contended that one mao should not have any more property than another; that all citi? zens should stand on an absolute equal ity regardless of industry or natural ability, and that it is the business of the government to support the people rather than the people to support the Government." Commissioner of Pensions Murphy has had several unpleasant interviews arish Republican Congressmen whet ac? cused him of having during the cam? paign purposely delayed answers to calls they made on the Pension Bureau in behalf of their constituents, for the ourpose of injuring them and prevent? ing their getting votes. Mr. Murphy denied the accusation in every case, but that didn't prevent the indignant Congressmen having their say, and it will not prevent their working to have Mr. Murphy's head be among the first that falls after the inauguration of President McKinley. C-ne of the notable absentees of the opening of the Senate was Senator Al? lison, of Iowa, who was kept at home by 4 severe cold. 

LIBERIA PAID INDEMNITY. Satisfaction Reauired for 111 Treating British Subjects The steamer Batanga, which has ar? rived at Liverpool from the west eoasl of Africa, reports that the British war? ship Alecto, which was sent to Libera in conseeiuence of British subjects ai Grand Bassa being molested and theil nroperty destroyed by Liberians, suc> ceeded in settling the difficulty satis factorily. After a full inquiry into all the fact of tha case, Colonel Cardew, governoi of the British colony of Sierra Leone who accompanied the Alecto, demand ed that $1,000 be paid by the Liberiai government as compensation for thi losses sustained by the Bri'ish. Thi Liberians hesitated in granting the de mand, whereupon the commander o the Alecto notified them that unles they complied by noon the next da; he would seize the custom house The indemnity was then paid. THE STORY OF THB DIFF1CULTIBS. Reports received at Sierra Leon some time ago stated that a club of Li berians had been formed at Grane Bassa, the object of the members o which was to annoy arid harass th Sierra Leone subjects in Liberia with aiow of driving them out of the coan ry. The hoi***-** of lara Sierra ' nt-rehanta?Mr N . and Mr ..eifel?wera set oa Bra. That of th* OSUiept gentlemen was entirely de? stroyed, the Liberians surrounding he burning building and threatening :o shoot any Sierra Leonian who at ;empred to extinguish the Hames or to lave any of the contents a notice aaa also posted up in the public streets ordering all Sierre Leone natives to juit that part of the lepublic within thirty days, otherwise they we>uld b*? killed by the members of the club. It was aaid that the leadimr citizens had no sympathy .with outrages, but tbat >n the contrary, they were seeking to bring the offenders to justice. It is believed that this disturbance arose out of the agitation which was begun a couple of months ago against Sierra Leone merchants accumulating large sums in business in Liberia and then returning with their earnings to their own oountry. It was thought probable that the outrages would have the effect of inducing the British gov? ernment to establish a resident in Liberia, as the French have recent? ly done. -???-? 

PECULIAR CONDITION. Italians Crowd Ont Oolored Laborers? The Tradesmen of Louisiana's Suear Districts Not Pleased with the Change. New Orleans. La., Dec. 1, Throughout the sugar district of Louisiana, from New Orleans to Baton Kouge. 120 miles, Italian labor is rapid ly driving out the colored labor and completely changing the country. The movement has been going on for half a dozen years, but is especially marked this year. Several large shiploads of Italians have arrived here this season, and have been placed at once at work on the sugar plantations, spending hardly a day in New Orleans. They are mainly peasant or farm laborer*?, generally from Sicily. Naples or south ern Italy, understand farm work thor oughly, and are satisfactory to the planter**, the only objection being tbe habit the Italians have of resenting in suits or injuries by assassination. How ever, as they confine this to themselves and rarely resort to it against Ameri? cans, it is overlooked WHITE MEN Ol-POPE THE CHANGE. Against the intrt duction of the al? lan peasant as a substitute for the col? ored labor there has arisen this year great objection throughout the sugar district, not from the colored people, but from the small merchants and storekeepers. The merchants in the country teiwns declare that they are being ruined by the Italians. One of the leading merchants of Don aid son - ville, in the heart of the sugar district, said the other day : "The heavy im? portation of Italians to our sugar plan? tations is doing us a great deal of inju? ry, and it is something that requires speedy action, The Italians first got a foothold here by working more cheap? ly than the colored pee?ple Year after year the number of Italians have in? creased and that of the colored folks decreased. If the present movement keeps up a colored man will soon be a novelty in Louisiana. We merchants suffer from this The colored people spend theirwages with us The Ital? ians do not spend over%10 per cent of their wages, saving 9<> p. r cent, to take back to Italy witn them. They can live for a quarter of what the colored people demand." 

WHITE NEWSPAPERS SPEAK OCT, TOO. The newspapers in the parishes have taken up the matter, and are siding with the eotintrj storekeepers against the Italians. The matter has found its way into politics, and the large major? ity that Louisiana gave for Bryan is largely due lo the fact that the resi? dents of the towns in the sugar dis? trict resenting the introduction of Ital? ian labor on the plantations, voted tbe Popocratic ticket because they knew the planters wanted McKinley. The element of spite entered largely into the late election. The probabilities are that the ijuestion will become a critical one in the next few Years. CHURCH VIEW NOTES. Decembers, 1896. The election is all over, but the en? joyment is hard to be forgotten by the republican ruters. On the 19th ult. 'he Shelly Road Band, near Saluda, Va , celebrated McKinley and Hobart, and buried Bryan. On the 25th ult. tin* Townbridge Band gave one of the largest celebrations from Townbridge hall to Urbanus, Va., that has ever been given by the republican party for the election of a republican President, Bryan is dead and Sewall is dying, McKinley is going to the white House flying. A goodly number of our prominent and out-skirt democrats have been sick e\er since tlie election, all be? cause of Bryan's defeat. We are sorry for their sickness, but glad 'tis noi ours. Tbe month of November was very warm until the extreme end of it, which resulted in a cold wave ending with snow and ice. Sleigh riding has numerous for the past several days with Saluda and Urbanna. Citizens, the recent cold snap has been the production of much hog kill? ing in our neighborhood. Mr. W. T. Richardson, of Church View, Va., has one of the finest lot of cabbages that has ever been raised in this country. The said Richardson furnishes ail the merchants in Urban? na, Church View, (Streets, Water View and other places weekly with them. Hurrah, hurrah for Church View. On Thursday night, Decembers, '96, Mr. V. Frazier, living near Church View was awakened by Mr. W. I). Eas? ton at ll :15 o'clock by a brilliant light Hashing from his store house, near his residence. Mr. Frazier was hard to awake and when he came to his mind, it was too late for any good to be done in the way of saving something. Among the contents of the store con? sumed was a good quanity of shoemak er's tools and a barrel of lima belong? ing- to the new church, Mount Zion. The loss is estimated at $50.00. The Richmond Plabet is much tak? en by our people more so now than ever. The hustling agent and report? er for tbe Planet?Mr. W. L Foster is making good use of his time in sell? ing the Planet, He furnishes cus? tomers with papers in Urbanna, Union Grove, Streets, church View and Ja? maica and has calls for the papers from Saluda and other places. So you see what probt it is to secure a hustling agent. Cards are out for the marriage of Mr. Alexander Hill to Miss Matilda Segar, Mr. Major Bagby and Miss Lucy Davis, Mr. Thomas Dc.vis and Miss Bet? tie Boyd, Mr. Charlie tiobmson and Miss Alice Page, Mr. J L. Davenport and Miss Lizzie Campbell. All in De? cember. 1890. Rally, boys rally I W. L. Foster, of Church View, Va., agent and reporter foi the ' Planet" expects to leave on tbe 14th or 15th inst for Baltimore, where he will spend a few days attending to his commis sian business, and as usual, Mr. Foster would be glad to see all of his_oredit ors and-have full settlement before that time as it takes money to buy oil for the machine. We have on our sick list:?Brother William B. Minor, who has been a long suffer with the Asthma ; also his old? est daughter, Miss Addie M. Minor, who is confined to her bed. We are glad to learn that Mrs. P. B. Gatewood, beloved wife of Mr. P. B. (Jatewood, who has suffered with a se? vere attack of poison-oak is on the mend. It has disfigured her face con? siderably. We look upon Mrs. Gate wood as a lady and a good Christian. There will be a grand rally at thu Antioch Baptist Church. Saluda, Va. on the third Sunday in December, '96 snd the young divine, Rev, C Towles former pastor of Mount Zion and Sa? lem Baptist Churches bas been re quebted to preach on that day The public is cordially invited to come ou and hear the great orator on that da] and contribute as much a? possible te tbe said church I will quote as wei aa I can remember: "Simon Peter lo vest thou me? Yea Lord, tho: knowest that I love thee, and Jesu said: Feed my sheep, 1 know rn; sheep a-.d I am known of mine." Yours for the Planet, W. L. Foster. 

DEPRAVITY. Shameful 1 rt at mt nt of Africans by a Christian Nation. PLEDGES ARE BROKEN. A KIM, HI Mil I Al LD His Kingdom is Despoiled. GR AVES OPENED AND ROI* DlaGUSTIUG ODTRAQEB-THE GLO? RY OP ENGLAJD 18 TARNI8HED -NO REDRE88 FOR THE WRONGED PEOPLE. [The Lagos, Africa, Weekly Record] Tbe Ashanti Expedition?or more pioperly speaking, the March to Kuma si?waa a success from a military point of view. In so far aa equipment, or? ganization and conduct were concern? ed, tbe expedition fulfilled the highest expectations and reflected credit upon the authorities who organized it and the officers charged with its command and conduct; and hence the latter, have not undeservingly, received spe? cial recognition for their services. The white soldiers too, who were engaged in the expedition, and were exposed to the risk of a donate highly inimical to Europ *an life, fully deserved the star awarded them for the jeopardy in which both officers and men were put in their perilous tramp to Kumusi, and the recent presentation to them by the Duke of Connaught ot the badge in recognition of such service, was quite apropos. But beyond tbe experiment of affording a practical test for British military organization, we fear the Ashanti expedition has little else to recommend it either as to ita purpose or results. But rather there seems every reason for believing that if the truth were known, it would conduce to cast much disparagement upon tha honour and integrity of the British name. It is well fknown that at the time tha expedition waa being fit? ted out, the accredited messengers of the King of Ashanti were in England tendering to Her Majesty's Govern? ment the submission of King Prempeh and bis acquiescence with the views and demands of the Government. THE KINO'S MESSENGERS Albeit the expedition was fitted out and despatched ; the king's messengers having been sent on in advance with some officers, the object of the latter being to ascertain whether the messen? gers were properly empowered emissa? ries of King Prempeh and had truly represented his views and attitude to? wards Her Majesty's Government. This programme was carried out com? pletely and satisfactorily, and as a re? sult King Prempeh despatched a mem? ber of his royal family to conclude ar? rangements with the British Officers on the conditions fixed by Her Majes? ty's Government, and in further com? pliance with those conditions, aent two persons of rank as hostages to be held as security for the due performance by him ot the condition imposed on him. The peaceable and acquiescent attitude on the part of Prempeh were consider? ed inadequate for the purpoaes of the military asperationa of the expedition and consequently they were ignored and the expedition marched into Ki masi. Here Prempeh intimated bis acceptance of the conditions imposed on him and tendered his submission to Governor Maxwell in a way which left no doubt as to his sincerity. CIVILIZED PRACTICES DISRBGAROED. Under the usual forms of procedure with civilized people in such cases, the act _? submission on the part of Prem? peh would have been regarded as suffi? cient to secure to himself and people immunity from molestation and vio? lence. But unhappily in this case, no regard whatever was hadjto such|forms and Prempeh discovered to his amaze? ment* and cost, that his submission yield cd him no consideration at 'he hands of the civilised and christian in? vaders of his country. There and then on the spur of the moment, he was re? quired to pay the cost of the expedi? tion and the unpaid balance of the war indemnity levied on his predecessor bv Sir Gannet Wolseley in 1874 On King Prempeh intimating that it was beyond his power to pay such a large sum of money down at once and re? questing that time should be allowed him to do so, he was answered by being promptly put under arrest with a num? ber of his family, including both males and females. NO JUSTIFICATION FOR IT. There was no justification for such treatment of the king, and the action of Governor Mazwell,? in the absence of any malfeasance on the part of the king or menace on the part of his peo? ple?was an outrage upon civilization and the bona fides of Her Majesty's Government. But this gross violation of the rules and principles governing civilized methods, appears to have been but the preliminary or prelude to more flagitious acts of vandalism, inspired by a spirit of excessive cupi? dity, which seem* to have seized upon every one connected with the expedi? tion. We are informed upon very reliable authority, that while the king was tendering his submission, and before he had finished doing so, his house and even other royal residences had been invaded by avaricious officers on the bunt for treasure. And here followed a general system of looting, spoliation and desecration, more worthy of a fe? rocious and barbarous people than of the subjects of a civilized and chris? tian government. DUG IN THE ROYAL GRAVES. We are told that in this hunt for gold, royal graves were dug open, and the treasures deposited therein ap? propriated ; coffins containing the dead were taken away, while in some cases the desecrated graves left open after the bodies had been rifled, while in others the skeletons were burnt. Under such circumstances of general plunder and spoliation, it is not to be surprised at if we find officers possess? ed of gold jewelry belonging to the royal family of Ashanti and which they claim as their private property. Judging from accounts, the act of submission by Prempeh waa the signal for a general and unrestrained system of looting, in which 'catch what you can' became the motto with every one. The sad death of ex-King Mensah at Prahsu under circumstances of unmi? tigated cruelty and barbarity, only tends to illustrate the excessive lust for gold which had been engendered by the looting at Kumasi. Mensah, we are told, was tempted with the ques? tion whether he desired to become King of Ashanti? And having in reply signified that he would not mind be? ing made king, he was informed thal if he pointed out tha whereabouts ol the royal golden stool he would be in? stalled as ruler. A BBASONABLK ANSWER To this Mensah returned the verj reasonable answer, that as he hat ceased to be king for a long time, he did not know where the royal stoo was now kept. But this answer, the reasonableness of wbiehjis so apparent served only to inspire chagrin with thi gold-thirsty officers, and aa a punish ment fer their disappointment, the; ordered the poor King to be removee to the coast without evidently, makin] any provision for his being supplier with food ; and as a consequence thi victim of their cupidity sucenmoed t starvation on the way and never reach ed the coast.But assuredly the questio demands to be tu-ked. What has th Government to say in respect of thi vandalism perpetrated in the nam and under the authority of the Quee and her government? The Ashanti expedition was honour ad with the presence- of representi tives of the Royal Blood of Englane and jet dishonoured and disgraeed b ths moat flagrant brea and trust in dealing with K peh and grcss violation and outrage uIron himself and people A SE AT HEN KEEFS HIS WO-D The King honourably and faithfully fulfilled all the obligations laid upon him, -tiered no resistance to the in? vasion of his country, and submitted to an ignominious ordeal in the inter? est of peace and goodwill; and in re? turn for this, himself and his family were deported and his country and people despoiled. lu tbe treatment of Prempeh, Eng? land has afforded unmistakable indi? cations that in dealing with so-called barbarous tribes, the civilized Po??er descends to the level of the barbarian and regulates its action more after the fashion of savages than the methods of civilized and christian govern? ments. But we cannot believe that this out? rage aud injustice will have tbe sanc? tion of the Eugli-h people. There can be no doubt that these uns voury features ot tbe recent march to Kuma si, have not been disclosed. Prem, eh, has however, now made an appeal, and in the interest ol justice and all thst is fair.it behooves that the whole truth in connection with the ex? pedition should be disclosed. SILLIED A FAIB NAME. If the expedition were intended to give honour and military renown to those engaged in it, such intention did not imply the sullying of Great Bri? tain's fair name, and we hope and be? lieve tbat when the British public be? comes fully acquainted with all that transpired at Kumasi. there will be created a general feeling of disgust and resentment, which will find h practical echo in more impart al and magnanimous treatment being accord? ed tha unfortunate King of Ashanti.
