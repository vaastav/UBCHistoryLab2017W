The Labor World is taken to task for its "con­ temptuous reference" to the decision of the Anthracite Coal Strike Com­ mission of 1903 on the rights of the individual, as a "moss-covered" opinion. By the same token it holds that if that "decision is moss-cov­ ered then the Declaration of Inde­ pendence and the Constitution of the United States are moss-covered do­ cuments, for the policy of the open shop is in entire harmony with the principle of government enunciated in those documents." The Bulletin would make the Anthracite Coal Strike decision the basic rule for industry as the Consti­ tution is the basic law of the land. "We will leave the Declaration of In­ dependence out of it for the time be­ ing. The principles of the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happi­ ness affirmed therein- will never grow old. Indeed they are much more (alive today than they have ever been before. The Constitution, however, Is sub­ ject to change and it Is changed to meet new conditions when they may arise, and it keeps each succeeding generation busy drafting new amend­ ments and arousing public thought lo compel backward inclining courts to look forward and keep the moss from growing on that good old bul­ wark of human liherty. Labor refuses to recognize the de­ cision of the Anthracite Coal Strike commission as the magna charta of industrial liberty. Since then con­ gress has enacted the Clayton, law and several others which outrank it in defining labor's right. Labor had no voice in selecting the Anthracite Coal Strike commission and it had precious little to do with its delibera­ tions. Its award was primarily re­ sponsible for the present chaotic con­ dition of the American coal indus­ try, and remembering it the coal miners refused at this time to take any chances in again dealing with such a board. That is one of the chief reasons why the strike was of such long duration. Lawyers are ever in the habit of discussing public questions from the legal standpoint. The Labor World had in mind the new world concept of industrial democracy when it cha­ racterized the "open shop" opinion of the Anthracite Coal Strike commis­ sion of 1903 as "moss-covered." ?This new concept was admirably ex­ pressed by President Wilson in his late message when he appealed to congress to "help in the difficult task iof finding a method that /will bring tobout a genuinei democratization of industry, based upon full recognition ©f the right of those who work, in "whatever rank, to participate in tome way in every decision which jflirectly affects their welfare.'* Further on he said: "Government must recognize the right of'men col­ lectively to bargain for human ob­ jects that have at their base the mu­ tual protection and welfare of those engaged in all industries. Re­ turn to the old standards of wage and Industry are unthinkable.'* I We are asked by the Bulletin to Ipoint out in what court or tribunal the "open shop" decision of 1903 ifaas been overruled. It is true it has feever been overruled by any judical, jtribuqal, for courts are not in the Jhabit of doing such things, but they always seem to find a way of modi­ fying former interpretation!! of the law which in lh.j eui have the effect of overruling the at. The fact ihr.t jthe President has reminded congress .that "old standards of wage and in­ dustry are unthinkable,'* is a reversal of the coal strike opinion. Congress, ^when it enacted tie Clayton act which declares that "the labor of a human being shall not be regarded *s an article of trade," also'reversed fchat decision. Byt the greatest trib loal of all, th« majority of the Amer­ 

SATURDAY- ican people,,has time and again.since 1903 declared itself on the side of collective labor. The Bulletin on the other hand quotes three recent decisions to prove that the opinion delivered by the An­ thracite Coal Commission in 1903 was still accepted by the courts, but it does not prove its case, for in each instance the issue was not the "open or closed" shop, but whether or not, in the absence of contract, an em­ ployer had a right to. discharge an employe because of his membership in a labor union, or refuse to give employment to such a person.. The decision involved the question of the blacklist and that alone. From a legal standpoint, however, it is admitted that both the so-called "open and closed" shops are lawful, the latter as a consequence of the right of contract. The average so called "open shop" advocate uses the term to justify his opposition to any sort of independent organization amdng his employes. He magnifies the "right of the individual" to "work when he pleases, for whom he pleases and on what terms lie pleases," but at the same time the employer makes all the rules and re­ gulations, and if the "independent" worker does not like them he can quit and starve, or submit to them and lose his precious independence. "Open shop" employers know bet­ ter that their species of an "open ing that their species of an "open shop" is a misnomer. It is the most autocratio closed shop in industry. It is without freedom. The workers have no voice in the making of the rules under which they are required to work, to which they must humbly submit or lose their jobs. While the "open shoppers" are grating aJwutr the individual's constitutional right to work when, where and for whom he pleases, they deny him all the rights within industry to which he is entitled. And that is all there" is to the so-called "open shop." the real autocratically managed closed shop. END OF COAL STRIKE. As The Labor World goes to press announcement is made that the coal Lodge that instead of .making strike is ended, and that the officers of the United Mine Workers have agreed to the proposal of President Wilson. Acting President Lewis ac­ cepted the proposal "because it con­ tains a definite concrete and prac­ tical method for adjustment of the miners* claim for increase wages." He also stated that the United Mine Workers have full confidence in the President of the United States and a profound regard for his will and judgment. We are all happy that the strike is ended, and we are hoping that it has taught all the people as well as the operators and miners a whole­ some lesson. Why there should be a coal famine in this country at any time is beyond understanding, There would not have been had the miners been permitted to work during the summer days when the mines were kept in idleness. Some day we per­ haps will know why the operators do not keep reserve piles of mined coal on hand. Would such have any effect on the market? It would be inter­ esting to know. The miners stood out for six weeks "Which is considerably longer than some people expected. They ought to have'returned to work on Judge! Anderson's order, but they didn't. Perhaps they would have, gone back without any understanding for the future had they not had previous ex­ perience with an indefinite assur­ ance given at the: time when the An­ thracite Coal Strike commission was appointed in 1903. The decision of this board is still fresh in the. minds of the miners and they want no such repetition. President Wilson's proposal was definite and specific,. The- miners are to get the 14 per cent increase proposed by Dr. Garfield. A tribunal is to be created to report if possible within 60 days, which will inquire into wages, costs of mining and oper­ ators' profits. If it is found that the 14 per cent award Is too low the com­ mission it is expected will order a further increase. If the operators are entitled to charge more for coal at the mine they will be permitted to increase the price. On this practical and definite proposition, the first made since the miners presented their demands to the operators, the officials of the union agreed to call the strike off. The labor forces in Minneapolis organized and led the fight against the extension of the street railway franchise in that city which was de­ feated by the voters at the election held last Tuesday. It was held to be not so much a proposed ordinance to extend the- life of th® traction franchise, but rather an ordinance to legalize the watered stock in the company and to guarantee a seven per cent dividend thereon. The peo­ ple of Minneapolis refuse to endorse this method of wiping out the sins of the past. 

TRUTH BUT NOT ALL OP IT. Most everybody oan get hold .of some truth Perhaps nobody can get hold of., all the troth. But to go about collecting truth and putting them together may help a bit. J. Philip Bird, of the National Association of Manufacturers, has issued a statement in which he says, "Only what is prdoucCi jpy the com­ bined efforts of capital and labor can be divided between them." And he adds that this is "the fundamental lesson that must be driven home to all the people, of the country and particularly to organized labor." Mr. Bird skidded along the edge of a slice, of truth. The New York Evening World tries to clear up what Mr. Bird means by the comment that "You can't find more in the cup­ board to take out if you put less in." And it asks, "Can't labor see that it cheats itself whenever it takes with­ out doing its share to replenish?" It is true that only that which is produced can be divided. Labor is not contending that it can reap with­ out driving nails and laying bricks. It knows there is no sausage until pigs are killed. But labor—along with all the rest of the people that make up what is called the General Public—has en­ countered a good many owners of capital who want all the sausage, leaving to labor nothing much but the squeal and perhaps a bone. You can't divide what isn't produced— but you can get some equity into th* business of dividing, if that is what you want to call the business of pay­ ing wages and fixing conditions and setting hours. That's where the rub comes. And when you grant to labor a voice in the business of determin­ ing wages and conditions and hours, you add a lot to the truth Mr. Bird started to tell about. A little truth can befuddle a lot of people some­ times. PARADOXICAL AFFINITIES. "We dare our senators to try the plan suggested by Mayor Magney of Duluth," challenges Frank A. Day in the Fairmont Sentinel, discussing the proposal of the mayor to Senator Of. course the senators will do nothing of the sort, but if they did, wouldn't Frank Kellogg have a hot time dealing with a tri-partite alli­ ance of tories, siniufeiners and bol shevists, all supporting him to defeat the League? Verily these interna­ tional issues do make paradoxical political affinities. There are some points in th® rela­ tions of employes and employers on which the I. W. W. and the Citizen's Alliance are in complete accord. Both oppose the principle of collect­ ive bargain, and both would rule by force. One cares nothing about the union shop, and the other opposes it. One stands for the "dictatorship of the proletariat," and the other the "dictatorship of the, industrial bar­ on." Both are autocrats. Trade unionism stands for democracy and against autocracy in any form. :——e-— "Wilson Urges. Law Against Rad­ icals,declares, a scare headline in the Milwaukee Leader, Victor Ber­ ber's Socialist paper. Wilson did nothing of the kind. He did urge the passage of laws to reach advo­ cates of violence in which he stated that: "Towards passion and male­ volence tending to commit crime there should be no leniency." If the Leader places all radicals in this class no wonder Victor Berger is be­ ing cent to jail. The committee from the local Cit­ izens' Alliance put up a decidedly weak argument to «ne county com­ missioners against the "recognition of the new union of county em­ ployes." "Make them give up the union," said Mr. L. C. Harris, "and refuse any increase in salaried until they do." That is a pretty stiff man­ date to come from a body of men who pride themselves on their Amer­ icanism. "O liberty how many crimes are committed in thy name." With the press, big business and industrial autocracy all waging war on organized labor and the best things it stands for, the American workingman now finds himself com­ pelled to fight for "a place in the sun.'* Objection is made to ft six-hour day for the coal miners, but the strike has made it necessary for every store Sn Duluth to go on ft Six-hour basis.

However distressing may be the present conduct of American extrem­ ists and exponents of overthrow, surely it is cheering news that comes out of Europe. Principally from France comes the good news.. The Radical Socialists of France espoused the Bolshevik idea. They lost some 85 seats in the election just held. Jean Lonquet, some eight months ago named by Lenine as Bolshevik representative in France, heads the list of those cast out by the voters of France. Pacifists/ Zimmerwalders, Sto,ckhol.mers—all were given instruc­ tions by the electorate to stay out of the chamber of deputies. In all the various Socialist parties of France lost more than Si 00 seats, but the Radical Socialists were hard? est hit. In Italy, wherei Socialists are of much the same brand, heavy losses were sustained, In Belgium, where Socialists have not been identified with pacifism and pro-Germanism and de­ featism, they gained heavily. But. the French and Italian pacifist doctrin­ aires have been taught something. It is doubtful if, American extrem­ ists of tlhe same type will gather any­ thing from this demonstration.
