DAILY INDEPENDENT. TUESDAY DEC.7, 1897 THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinley sent hi9 first annual message to Congress Monday, it is a very lengtliy document and deals thoroughly with all the im portant affairs of the Government. The President congratulates the people that the Nation is at peace with all the world and that prosper ity, lxavirony and good will reign su preme within our borders. After tubing a shy at the Dingley tariff law in which he says its full effects have not yet been realized, the President tabes up the currency question and discusses it from the standpoint of the powers that elected hioi. Below will be found his re commendations on this and other im portant questions now before the people: t ."I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts of the government are quite sufficient to pay all the ex penses of the government, that when any of the 'United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart, and ouly i paiu out m exchange for golti. TIdh is an obvious dniy. If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and ge's it from the government he should reeeivo back from the gov ernment u United S.aies note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government is sues an interest hearing debt to pro vide gold foe the redemption of Unit ed Sta.es notes?u no i-iutereat bear ing debt. Surely, it should not pay them out again e::cepton demand and for gold. If they are put out in any other way they may retuvu again to be fol'owed by another bond issue to redeem them?Alio'her iuterest hear ing debt to redeem a non-interest bearing debt. "In my view it is of the Utmost im porinnce that tho government should be relieved of the business of pro viding for all the gold required for exchanges and o:;por.s. This respon sibility is alone borne by tho govern meut without any of the usual and necessary banking powers to help it self. The hanks do not f el the strain of the gold redemption. The whole strata rests upon the government, and the size of the gold reserve in the treasury lias come to be, with or with out reason, the s-gnal of danger or security.. This ought to he stopped. "Jf wo are to have an era of p-os perity in the country, with suilicient receipts for the expenses of the gov ernment, wo mny feel ro immediate embarrassment from our present cur I i A.1 .1 ?A. * 11 * ' 1 rency; uui rue uauger suu u ;isis auu will be ever present menacing us as long as the existing system contin ues. And besides, it is in times of adequate revenues and business Iran quility that the government must pre pare for the worst. We cannot avoid without serious consequence, the wise consideration and prompt solu tion of this question. "The Secretary of the Treasury has outlined a plan in great detail for the pu-pose of removing threatened re currence of a debted gold reserve and save us front future embarrassment on that account. To this plan I in vito yohr. en reful' consideration. "1 concur with the Secelary of the Treasury in his recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of .the bonds which they have deposited for circu lation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to ono half ono per cont per annum. I also join him in recom mending that authority bo given for the establishment of national banks with a minimum capital of &?,*>,000. This will enable the smaller villages and agricultural regions of the coun try to be supplied with currency to meet their noeds. A t "1 recommend that the issue of Na tional Hank notes oe restricted to the denomination of ten dollars and up ward. If the suggestions I have here in made shall have the approval of Congress, then I would recommend that national banks be required to re deem their notes in gold." The Cuban question is discussed at co-.siderable lengcli. The President regards the recognition of the bollig ereucy of me Cuban insurgetsas now unwise and therefore inadmissable, but spy8 that i? this *tep hereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duly, the Executive will take it. The President urges the ratification of the treaty for the annexa tion of Hawaii, and puvb thai the questions that have arisen be* twoen Japan and Hawaii are in a fair way of settlement. The President urges the speedy cons'ruction of the Nicaragua canal ? id touches very lightly on the WoJ m . at i III ? ' ' ? < COtC lm * mouuuc CO0C. IllISS'OD. He merely states tlmt he ap pointed the commission {and that opto this time no agreement line been reached with foreign countries.. Alaskan matters ere discussed. A hotter system of government for the pou'do of that mecctj of the gold soelf er is urged. Tlie TTesiuent says that i' the reports <>f the sufferings of the people now there be further verified' every effort at any cost should be uiade to carry them relief. The President lakes up the salo of the Union Pacific Railway and says the Government received the full amount of its claim against that road. 1 n regard to the sale of the Knusas Pacific rodroad, the* President urges that the Government be authorized to qualify as a b>dder at the sale in or der that its rights may be protected. To qual'fy the Government will be compelled to mako a deposit of $900, 000 and the President believes that under the act of J887 the Government has the power to mako the deposit and in the absence of any action by Congress ho would direct the Secre tary of the Treasury to mako the nec [Continued on th;rd page.]
