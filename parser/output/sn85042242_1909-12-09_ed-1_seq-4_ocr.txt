THE GOVERNMENT AS AN EDU CATOR. St. Louis Globe-Democrat: To an extent not even remotely approached by any other country the United States Government discloses its oper ations and its interests to its own people and to the world. Within the past few days the annual reports of the secretary of the navy and of the heads of other departments and the chiefs of bureaus have been publish ed. On Tuesday the president's mes sage was presented to congress, and on the day following congress will get the annual report of the secre tary of the treasury. Here is a mass of literature which, in volume and in minuteness of de tail, far surpasses that presented by any other government. Except the message by Mr. Cleveland in 1887, which dealt with one subject only, the tariff, all the annual messages of the past quarter of a century have spread themselves over many col umns ofr the newspapers, and have touche«aJfti every topic in which gov ernmf-ejit \s had any concern. Some fta,evelt,s annual communi- 18 coQalned almost as many as a j3 in the average book of or\iW pages. Every subject in which and consid erable number of Americans have any intelligent interest is discussed at this time every year by the presi dent and by the heads of the various -executive departments and their sub divisions. The chances for obtaining a liberal education in the operations and interests of this government as it touches every other country, are thus within reach of every American. This information is .spread before the whole world. He who runs may read. These disclosures deal candid as well as comprehensively with the things that they concern them selves with. They extenuate nothing and they set naught down in malice. JM)T A 

SENSATIONAL DOCUMENT. The message of President Taft to 'congress is not sensational, not alar mist, and deals sensibly and fairly w'ith the public matters now before -the people of this country. He de votes a good share of it to the rela tions of this nation with foreign countries, and it is a matter for con gratulation that, except for the Ni caragua incident, our relations with all powers are peaceful and amicable. With reference to the sugar scandal, Jt Is suggested that congress do not by a too sudden entrance into the field of investigation handicap the of ficials of the department of justice who are now probing the question. The tariff is to be given a chance to 'speak for itself through a fair trial, and it seems probable that public opinion with reference to it may change sensibly, when the effect of the country so far as its rates were concerned, might have the undesir- able effect of reducing employment and closing business concerns and fcctosl^s. We are legislating now for ait immense country, and we most take Into consideration the needa of all parts of it. The tone of the president's message is temperate, and he appreciates the constltntionsl provision that the con gress has the duty of legislation. It is for the president to call to the at- ,„ .. dertake to secure specimens In dup tfae bill become apparent. No tariffs ,.* .* *. tion of the stock being detained in might exactly suit a great share of| to its work, and to execute the laws that are passed. The forthcoming resignation of Col. C. W. Mott, the immigration agent of the Northern Pacific road, removes another of the conspicuous figures in the development of the northwest. Fortunately, Col. Mott, after a rest for a time, will resume his activities in some other field, and the benefit of nis efforts will not fee lost to the cause of immigration. Col. Mott is one of the old time boomers for the section of the country along the Northern Pacific road. With the late Max Bass, formerly immigration agent of the Great Northern, he has been concerned with the settlement of North Dakota through the immi gration departments of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific roads. He has prepared and issued much of the literature that has been circu lated by the Northern Pacific road, and his field has been a wide one, extending from the terminals of the road at Duluth and St. Paul clear to the Pacific coast, and the mines, for est and fruit lands of Washington and Oregon. At the various immi gration meetings and agricultural gatherings, Col. Mott has always been a ready and timely speaker. He was at Bismarck four or six years ago, when the state made its first appro priation for the attracting of immi gration to this section, and his coun sel and advice were of value to the legislators who were preparing the bill. It is to be hoped that his re tirement from the immigration field is only temporary and that when he returns to the work it will be in the same northwest, to whose growth and prosperity he has been so valuable and effective a contributor. «g «j» 3» ${»{ {$» «3»
