It is a straight-forward, manly pro duction, abounding iu truthful narrative and .common-sense logic. Ko one can doubt its pa ternity. It bus the fcaturus. and literary ear marks of oObi Abe," and is Lincoln all over. It is the conception of a clear load and an hon est heart, and is fearlessly promulgated as a dis closure of the acts, views and intentions of an Executive who is more.of a patriot Uian a pot-itieiunTT-wlioae love of truth, mercy nud justice is tin oyiioauro of his ambition. , He has not buried his. opinions in mystic tropes and figures, but has uttered them in plain English, ossify comprehended by the masses of the American public, whoso President ho is, and whose wel faro ho is faithfully endeavoring to promote.

Although our national .debt is large, and rapidly increas ing, we have the satisfuctinn of knowing that it is a home debt, which is becoming so fini'l.cn1 as to preclude the probability of serious pnssul or future embarrassment. Our currency, for do mestic purposes, has, perhaps never been excell ed, in time of war ; and the production of the preoiom metals, afforded by cur inexhaustible mines, gives presage of sn eurly return to a spe cie basis, after the establishment of pence. Our expenditures during this war, it appears, will not prove that their sum is so much capital sunk, for we shall have a Navy that will he a ble to cope with that of any single government on the globe, if not with the combined powers of tho world, itWe adhere to our defensive pol icy. Ourland fortifications and armorits, will beof immense value, and may bo worth, as h menace, oven while idle, five times the amount of their cost, snytny nothing of the value of the military discipline of our citizen soldiery'. The Pn-sirleiit's plan of teconstruetion seems to meeet the ;eord!a1 approbation of nearly all true Union men, and is likely to prove sb effect ive as it is wise and merciful. There is little doubt but the amnesty it proff.ra will be em braced by tho nonslnvcbolding massts of the Sinllh, as euon as it is fully understood.

Our naval ves sels have been increased from' "6 to SH8, includ ing many substantial iron-claels, constructed and in process of cetnstructiou. From the report of our excellent Secretary of the Treasury we glean the fact that, up to tho 2!)lh ult., one hundred and thirty four ssseicia tious hail organized unebr tho National Act, and aelopted the name of "National Bank.o These institutions have sprung up in seventeen States and iti moat of the principle cities in the Union, New Orleans not excepted.
