Thi- neighborhood bas been in a terrible Mate of excitement for tbe pust month, oc Kisiatied by the burning of Captain Thomas Walking's " granary, containing about tive hundred bushels of wheat, his macbiuery, :nd farming implements. At 11 o'clock on tbe night of tbe 31st of October some vil lains set tire to his stables, containing twelve or litteeu bead of horses and mules, his prize tobacco barn, granary, and straw i'.ack-, all about the same time. Tbe fire was discovered iu time to save the barn and stabh-s, but the granary and contents, with the straw-stacks, were a total loss. Captain Watkin-, fearing this would be repeated, wrote to your city for a good detective to fer ret out the guilty parties. Detective R. B. Craddock was sent up. unknown to anyone in tbe neighborhood. He went diligently to work to bunt them up. Yesterday he arrested Erasmus Moore, Wyatt Pleasants, and Pre fecilla Coleman (all colored). They were exam ined before Justices Hurt and Snead, andsant j on for indictment before tbe Circuit Court which meets in March. Tbey were commit ted to jail. There are several others impli- 1 cited, and Mr. Craddock says he will soon get them. They have been a terror to this community for a long time; but tbe negroes ' and ujtau white men, since Mr. Craddock'sj arrival in thi* county, are completely terror stricken. They are a vindictive set, and for the slightest imaginary wrong apply the torch; and but tor Captain Watkln9, to whom tbe citizens of this county owe a debt of gratitude for the action he has taken iu ridding this community of so vile a gang J of outlaws, there is no telling where it would end, as no one was safe.

The passenger train bound north, under charge of Captain John Fossetfc, had been detained some time near GordonavlHe on ac count of an accident to ibe eccentric of the engine. Huouing out of time, Orange Court hou*e was reached, when the machinery a?ain got out of fix, and another stop wtm made to repair damages. Just at this time a stock- train, which had been ordered to follow in the wake of the passenger train, made its appearance around a sharp curve in the road, and despite the efforts of the engineer his en gine ran into the sleeping -coach of the passenger train with great force,- detach ing the coach from the ladies' car, and carry ing terror to its occupants, who were nearly all sleeping. Of the twenty-seven passen gers in Uiis car only three escaped lojury, though, fortunately, the wounds received were generally of a slight character. One passenger was knocked through the window of the csr, and landed on ttrra firma some ten feet off. The car was a complete wreck, the windows being badly smashed, and the scats torn from their places and badly broken. The occupants of the car were principally Knights Templar, from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and other northern citios, with several from Baltimore. After the sleeping coach had been detached the remainder of the passenger train started down a grade seventy feet to the mile towards Ripidan sta tion, and the engineer, after having put on steam, for some cause jumped from the speeding train, followed closely by the fire man. At this juncture the situation became crit ical, promising the destruction of the remain ing sixty passengers, when two brave young men, named Spears and Kemp, crawled through the baggage-car and over the tender to the engineer's cab, and shut off the steam, by which means the train was brought to a halt, after running six miles. It was found that the laoie^ car had also been badly wrecked and a large number of the occu pants wounded. In all, some forty persons .were more or less injured, and it seems a mi racle that all escaped with their lives. Amongst the travellers were a bride and groom from Wisconsin, occupying berths in the sleeping-car. The groom wa9 pitched out of bed and badly cut about the bead and face, while the bride escaped without a scratch. The passengers unite in exon erating Captain FoWtt from any dere liction of duty, but are of opinion that there was a want of proper precaution some where. A train was speedily dispatched from Alexandria to the scene of the disaster, and the wounded reached that city yesterday afternoon. Nearly all the male passengers wounded were Knights Templar, returniBg from the triennial convention at New Orleans. Their injuries amounted chiefly to scratches and bruises ; some had head and face-cuts and bruises which will show rather budly when they return home to their wives from the great *' lodge meeting." Arriving in Baltimore, the Knights Templar and other passengers bound North went on through. Several Knights injured rather painfully in the general smash-up rested in Washington, and others remained over in Baltimore. Mr. George L. McCann, Past Grand High Priest of Baltimore, was in the sleeping-car, and re ceived slight injury. A press telegram from Washington gives the following concerning the accident : About twenty of the Washington Tem plars on their way home from New Orleans were slightly bruised, none seriously. The engineer of tbe freight train, when he first saw the approaching train, jumped to his post and opened the throttle-valve, but too late. The train being in motion he was thrown off, and on it sped. Knowing there must have been such an accident, Mr. James Kemp, an engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, who was among the passen gers, succeeded in reaching the engine, and. stopping it, after it bad^ run about miles.? Baltimore Sun, 8th, History of the Vicksburg Troubles. ? Yicksburg ; Miss., December 7. ? Tbere has been for some time trouble brewing be tween the Tax-Pay ers' Association and the city and county officials. The she riff is acting without a legal bond, and the Board of Supervisors refused to order a new one, although the time for paying taxes had arrived. Two or three other officials were under indictment for forgery and embezzle ment, and tbe citizens, despairing of any re lief from the partisan courts, held a meet ing last Wednesday, and in a body pro ceeded to the court-tiouse to demand the re signation of the sheriff, chancery clerk, trea surer, and coroner. All fled except Sheriff Crosby (a negro), and be signed his resignation. On Saturday a card appeared in the streets signed " Cros by," calling all citizens of Warren county, Republicans, white and colored, to come to his aid and support him in his position. Crosby publicly and through the papers de nied tbe authorship of the card ; yet this morning armed bodies of negroes appeared advancing on tbe city from six different roads. An alarm was sounded about 9 o'clock, and the citizens gathered en masse, armed, and immediately advanced to meet the negroes on the Baldwin's Ferry road. The negroes were met just outside the city, near Grove street, about 200 strong. Tbe commaDder of tbe citizens warned the negroes to disperse, but they refused, and immediately tiring commenced on both sides. Tbe negroes retreated about a mile and again made a stand in the old breastworks and a bouse, but were soon routed. The loss in this engagement was one citizen (Oliver Brown) killed ; about twelve or fifteen ne groes killed, several wounded, and about twenty prisoners. On the Hill's Ferry road about 250 negroes were met and routed after a Bhort engagement, with several killed and wounded. Andrew Owens, the negro who commanded the negroes on tbe Baldwin's Ferry road, was captured and committed to jail. In an interview with a reporter, Owens says he was ordered by Sheriff Crosby to come to the city to-day with all the armed men be could get together. r Alexander Stockbouse, from Newton, one of the cap tured negroes, says an order for all negroes to come to Yicksburg this morning was read in cburcb on Sunday. Crosby, who is under guard at the court-bouse, denies that he gave such orders. It is reported this evening that negroes are committing depredations in the country. The intense excitement that pre vailed this morning bas subsided to a great degree; yet many citizens are under arms, and all roads are picketed. Latest.? Evidence just received renders it absolutely certain that Governor Ames and his Attorney-General (George E. Harris) incited and advised the invasion of this city by the negroes to-day. This evidence has been laid before the ablest lawyers of the city with views to arresting and bringing these parties to this city for trial. Ajr-Link Railroad.?

C., December 8.~ John P. Brady, a member of the Virginia House of Delegate?, from Nottoway county, ar rived here to-day with a series of charges, to prevent to the House of Representatives against Congressman Stowell. They are in substance, first, having appointed one school craft to a naval cadetsblp while said school craft resided put of his (Sto weirs) district f and next, with having received one thou sand dollars for said appointment* All of which Brady s^8 will prove. The charges are in- the shape of a petition addressed to the Speaker, and recite in de tail the improper conduct alleged to have been committed by Stowell. Mr. Brady found some difficulty in getting the Radical members from Virginia to pre sent his petition, having applied In vaia to alL of them by turns. Each thought it a delicate matter to handle, and begged to be excused, while Piatt peremptorily refused to present it on the ground that Stowell was as well his personal friend as his political colleague. Finally, Mr. Brady had an oppor tunity of meeting the Speaker in Stowell'3 presence and handed the charges to that offi cer in person, and the under standing now is that Stowell himself will call it to the atten Hon of the House during the present week. Among the witnesses that Brady requests to be summoned are Secretary Robeson, Messrs. George W. Graham, A. P. Lathrop, and S. F. Maddox, of the Virginia State Senate; Godfrey May, David G. Carr, John P. Brady, Charles H. Porter, Dr. Beatty Mcr George, and several others. Mr. Brady seems very earnest in prosecuting this affair. He was introduced to the Speaker by Stowell himself. proposition to Bedace the President's Salary. Tbe spirit of economy manifested itself in the Senate to-day by a resolution making the salary of the President $25,000 per annum after the close of the present presidential term. The bill will hardly become a law, as there is a rather solid impression in Con gress that $50,000 a year is not too much for the President of the United States, proposed Change for tbe Better.

Tbe Herald says: "Tbe message of President Grant is a more creditable document, botb in point of reasoning and literary execution, than its predecessors from the same source. The President makes it clear enough that in bis view of tbe three principal causes which have led to tbe disastrous defeat of his party are tbe prostration of business, the condi tion of tbe southern States, and tbe unsuc cessful experiment of reforming the civil service. This is not directly stated, but it is necessarily implied in tbe texture of . bis views on these subjects. The sum of the message, so far as it has a party bearing, is the committal of the President to the resto ration of a sound currency, an implied pro mise to treat the South with leniency and justice, and abandon the civil-service reform unless Congress supports it by legislation. This is tbe programme of President Grant for reinstatisg the Republican party. "Tbe President has got tbe Spanish ques tion into 6uch a state that it can be fanned into a flame whenever be thinks it expe dient. He relies on tbe country to support him in a war in which tbe abolition of slavery in Cuba and tbe breaking of the yoke of colonial servitude will be the leading ideas. But General Grant makes a stupend ous mistake if be thinks be can play this des perate game with success. If he has 'pi geon-holed' our just complaint against Spain with such a purpose be will have cause to rue tbe day when be meditated such a trick. "Tbe financial recommendations of the message are sound in principle but defective in detail." The Times considers tbe President's views on finances have undergone no change, and bis proposition to repeal the legal-tender clause as sound. The President In stating that be will still sustain Kellogg does not say what be will do about Packard and Casey, which is a pity.. The Times thinks the President's reference to southern matters is plain advice given in kindness and frankness. In regard to tbe civil-service reform the Times says: "We are sorry that be an nounces bis intention of abandoning tbe civil-service reform unless Congress dis tinctly supports it by legislation. It was an attempt that promised much, and might have been made to yield great results. With bis recommendations us to specie payment and free banking we are in entire sympa thy." > The Tribune considers this the best mes sage of the President, because probably it was written under tbe chastening of tbe late elections. It condemns hfs position to wards Louisiana, but comments mainly on nearly all the rest of tbe message. The Sun says : 41 The President's message is reasonably sound, theoretically, on hard money and a return to specie payment, but the President's arguments are not as urgent as his theories are sound, while some of bis plans for retiring our paper money and re viving gold and silver as a circulating me dium will provoke severe criticism not only of tbe inflationist", but of tbe bard-money men as well. With the exception of bis re commendations of free banking, the views he now expresses concerning tbe currency are but a rtiteration of bis veto of the green back bill of last session." The World says : " President Grant and Secretary Bristow are less in doubt than tbe Republican press and politicians as to the significance of the overthrow of their party in tbe late elections. They have reached the clear opiuion by wnat "means, if by any means, tbe political revolution can be stopped midway, and tbe Democratic party hindered from taking possession of every de partment of tbe Government in tbe elections of 1876. They recommend immediate steps towards specie payments, not promises of execution which are perpetually postponed, and a reform of tariff to the end of obtaining a larger revenue by lower duties on fewer articles. This, their concurrent advice, ex hibits tbe President's and the Secretary's ap preciation at last of tbe great evils from which the country is suffering, and their ad mission that those evils are of legislative ori gin, and admit of legislative remedy. Add to this the exorbitances and usurpations of power on tbe part of the Jb'ederal Govern ment, and General Grant and Secretary Bris tow will have discovered precisely tbe vul nerable points in the Republican policy upon which tbe Democratic assaults have been concentrated and irresistible. They advise Congress to abandon tbe defence of what is Indefensible, and to frustrate further Demo cratic victories by themselves now doing what a desparing people have elected the next Democratic Congress to do."
