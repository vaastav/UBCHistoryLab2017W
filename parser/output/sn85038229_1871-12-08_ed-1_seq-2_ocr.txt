On Tuesday in the House, the Presidents Message, and its appro priate reference, engaged attention up till adjournment, and nothing of material importance transpired in the Senate.

DETERMINED EFFORT IS being made to split the Republicans in the organization of the Legislature, and especially on the Senatorial question but so far, it has met with but little success. The Democracy are offer ing certain parties the Speakership of the House, and the Chairmanships of different important committees, in order to get them to vote with them on the Senatorial question. The have not met with success com mensurate with their efforts. The present cold spell has occa sioned a "close up" much earlier than usual, and it is thought that the result will be very disastrous in commercial circles. A'large num ber of vessels large and small are frozen in the Welland Canal, while four hundred canal boats, with car goes estimated at from three to four millions dollars, are frozen up be tween Buffalo and Albany. From the upper lakes, the reports are equally discouraging. j Congress.

I The Message. We devote a large portion of our space this week to the message of President Grant, which our subscri bers will be pleased to read. It con gratulates the country on the pre valence of peace, but refers in appro priate terms to the heavy loss of property and life by storm and fire, which have marked the past year, and pays a proper tribute to the gen eral sympathy manifested to suffer ers not only at home but abroad He refers, as well he may, with pride, to the Washington Treaty, in view of the important results which may accrue from it From the message we learn that the Public Debt has been decreased during the year $86, 057,126, and that by the sale of the 5 per cent bond, a saving of $17,000, 000 in annual interest alone, will re suit. In his recommendations the Pres ident urges a further reduction of internal taxation, and the limitation of taxes to liquors and tobacco, He also urges a reduction in customs duties, and would place articles not produced in this country on the free list The Postal Telegraph sugges tions meets with a hearty approval at the hands of the President Considerable space is devoted to the action which has been taken un der the Ku-Klux laws, showing their wisdom, and that the results promise the pacification of that section of country whera that species of law lessness abounded. In reference to the Mormon mat ters, the President makes a recom mendation of special legislation in favor of the children born under po- ligamy. He expresses much satisfaction with the new policy in the manage ment of the Indians, and hopes for much good to result therefrom. Civil service reform is urged up on tne attention oi congress, ana further action in that direction sug gested, as well as upon various other subjects, As a whole, the message will prove in every way acceptable to the peo pie, and increase their respect for their worthy chief Magistrate. so on of by ing the is the yet 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE To the Senate and House of Representatives: In addressing my third annual messace to the law-making branch of the Government, it is eratifyine to be able to state that during the past year suocess has generally attended the efforts to execute all laws found upon the stat ute books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws already enacted. but to learn their special intent and to enforce them accordingly. The post year has been, under a wise provi dence, one of Droiceritv to the nation. It has. however, been attended with more than usual chastisements in the loss ot life and property, bystorm and fire. These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign nations, which goes far toward alleviating the disasters occasioned by the calamities. The benevolent, who have so generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes, wiU reap their reward in tbe consciousness of Having per formed a noble act, and m receiving the grate ful thanks the men, women and children whose sufferings they have relieved. OUB 

BELATIONS WITH POBHI05 rOWEES. The relations of the United States with for eign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an eventful one, in witnessing two great nations, speaking one language and having one lineage, settling, by peaceful arbi tration, of long standing and liable at the the The The jact oi the that to act the out and the lease their any time to bring those nations into bloody and hostile conflicts. An example has thus been set which, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations and be the final means of returning to productive industry millions of men now maintained to settle disputes of nations by the bayonet and broadsword. TEE TEKATT Or THE JOIST HIGH COMMISSION. I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty al luded to, wnicn nag been concluded since tne adjournment of Congress with her Britanic Majesty, and a copy of the protocol of tbe con ference of the Commissioners by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting questions pending between two na tions where various Questions are to be ad- usted by arbitration. I recommend Congress, at an early day, to make the necessary pro vision for the tribunal at Geneva and for the several Commissions on part of the United States, called for by the treaty. His majesty the King of Italy, President of the Swiss Confederation, and his majesty the .emperor of Jttrazu, have each consented, on the joint request of the two Dowers, to name the arbitrator for the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness with which the joint renuest has been complied with by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to those important positions. His majesty the Emper or of GermaiiJ has been pleased to comply with the joint request ol the two governments. and has consented to act as tn arbitrator of the disputed water boundary between tie united states and Great .Britain. The con tracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as between themselves, certain prin ciple of public law for which the United States have contended from the commencement of their history; they have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of other maritime powers and to invite them to accede totneni. negotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to bo extended to the powers and I recom mend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of treaty relative to the fisheries, and the other matters touching the relations of the United States towards British North American possessions, to become operative as soon as the proper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its possessions. is much to be desired that the legislation may become co-operative before fishermen of the United States begin to make arrangements for the coming season. I have addressed a communication, of which copy is transmitted herewith, rsi the ;- nors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indi ana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those States, resnact- ively, the necessary action on their part to : . - l -v. v . ... , . . ... carry into affect the object of h. article ol the V treaty, which contemplates the use of the canals on the other side, connected wun ine navigation of the lakes and the rivers, forming the boundary, on terms of equity by the in habitants of 'both countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object and the benefits to flow therefrom, will secure the speedy ap proval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. 

BOUNDARY LINE. I renew the recommendation for an appro priation for determining the true position of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it forms the boundary between theUnited States and the British Aortn American possession., between the Lake of the Woods and the sum mit of the Rocky Mountains. The early ac tion of Congress upon this recommendation would put in the power of the War Depart ment to place a force in the held during the FRANCE AND GERMANY. The resumption of diplomatic relations be tween France and Germany have enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended to Germans in France by the diplomatic snd consular representation of the United States in that country. It is just to add, that the delicate duty of this protec tion has been performed by the Minister and the Consul General at fans, ana ine tuiu iVn.nk in Pnuii-jL tinder the sunervision ui h. latt.r with irroat kindness as well as with prudence and tact Their course has received the commendation of the German government and has wounded no susceptibility of the French. The government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendly feeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize with the moderate ana lust poli cy which this government maintains in its relations with Asiatic powers as well as with tha Smith American Republics. I have given that the friendly feelings of that onnrmnmit are fullv shared by the United States. The ratification of the consular and naturalization connections with the Austro- Hungary government have been sxenangea. have been officially informed of the annexa tion of the States of the Church to the king dom of Italy and the removal of that kingdom to Rome, In conformity with the established policy of the United States. I have recog nized this change. The ratification of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged; the two pow ers have agreed in their treaty that property sea shad be exempt from capture in case of war between the two powers. The United States have spared no opportunity of incor porating this rule into the obligations of na tions. SPANISH CLAIMS. Ths Forty-first Congress, at its third see sion. made an appropriation for the organiza tion of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, growing out of the in surrection in Spam. That Commission has since been organized. I transmit herewith the correspondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this commission will afford the claimants a com plete remedy for their injuries. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference at Washington betwen the plenipotentiaries of Spain and the allied South America Repub lics, which has resulted in an armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace 

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. The intimate friendly relations which have long existed between the United States and Russia, continues undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his govern ment to diminish the cordiality of those re lations. The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand Duke, is a proof that our side we share the wishes of that gov ernment. Tbe inexcusable course of the Rus sian Minister at Washington, rendered it ne cessary to ask his re-call and to decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic representative, it was impossiDie, witn seu respect or with a just regard to the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Catocazy to con tinue to hold intercourse with this government after his abuse of government officials and during his persistent interference, through various means, wun tne relations petween tne United States and other powers. In accor dance with my wishes, this government has been relieved of further intercourse with Mr. Catocazy and the management of the affairs of the imperial legation has passed into the hands a gentleman entirely unoDjectionaDie. JAPAN AND CHINA. With Japan we continue to maintain Inti mate relations. Aue aniuet 01 tue maxauo has. since the class of the hut session of Con gress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in important offices in several depart ments of the government, i nave reason to think that this selection is due to an apprecia tion of the disinterestedness of the policy which the United States have pursued towards Japan. It is our desire to cdntinue to main tain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan, the corrrespondence, transmitted herewith, shows that there is no disposition on the part of this government to swerve from its established course. Prompted a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment oi our smpwrecaeu sauors at tne Corean coast, I instructed our Minister at Pekin to endeavor to conclude a convention with Corea for securing the safety and hu mane treatment of such mariners. Admiral Rogers was instructed to accompany with suf ficient force to protect him, in cose of need, a small surveying party was sent out. On reach the coast he was attacked at a disadvan tage. Ample opportunity was given for ex planation and apology for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed. After an ar duous march over a rugged and difficult coun try, the forts from which the outrages had been committed were gallantly assaulted and destroyed. Having thus punished the crimi nals, and having vindicated the honor of the nog, the expedition returned, x lndmg it im practicable, under the circumstances, to con clude the desired convention, I respectfully refer to the correspondence relating thereto herewith submitted, and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see ht to take, MEXICO. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealer! very objectionable law establishing what known as the "Free Zone" on tho frontier of United States. It is hoped that this may be done, and also that more stringent measures may be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless persona on its frontier. hone that Mexico, by its own action, will soon this government of the difficulties ex perienced trom this cause. CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. Our relations with the various Republics of Central ana ooutn America continue, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly. I rec ommend some action by Congress regarding over-due installments unaer tne award of Venezula Chums Commission of 1866. internal dissensions of this government present no lustitications for the absence of ef to meet their solemn treaty obligations. ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged. It is a sub- for congratulation that the Great Empire urazu nas taken tne initiatory steps toward abolition of slavery. Our relations with Empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so by this act. It is not too much hope that the government of Brazil may hereafter find it for its interests, as well as in trinsically right, to advance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present contemplates. The true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the ele vation and education of its laborers. It is a subject for regret that the reforms in this di rection, which were voluntarily promised by statesmen of Spain have not been carried in its West Indian Colonies. The laws regulations for the apparent abolition of Blayery in Cuba and Porto Kico leave most of laborers in bondage, with no hope of re until their lives have become a burden to employers. 

CITIZENS OF THE U. S. HOLDING SLAVES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. desire to direct your attention to tha fact the citizens ot tne united States are large holders, in foreign lands, of she inm of property forbidden by the fundamental law of country. A recommend to Congress to provide oy stringent legislation a suitable pen alty against the holding, owning or dealing in slaves or being interested in slave pronertv in foreign lands, either as owners, hirers or mort gagors, by persons 01 tne united States. CUBAN TROUBLES. It is to be regretted that the disturbed con dition of the Island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The ex istence of a protracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, cannot be other than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the affairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, and the blessings of free in stitutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to nmtoi the lives and property of ftona fide American citizens and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all nendini? onest;,. with Spain, growing out of the affairs in Cuba, may be adjusted in the spirit of pesce and con ciliation which has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of such questions. a ENCOURAGEMENT OF WITH CHINA AND JAPAN. To give importance and to add to the effi ciency droT diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and "to txitZZ in commercial rela tions the good opinion of those pcoj,! ;jd to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between those na tions and the balance of the commercial world I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of these countries to serve as a part of the official family of our Ministers there. Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the re presentatives ot Great Britain and some other powers. Ab now situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for in terpreters and translators upon the natives of those countries, who know our language im perfectly, or procure for the occasion the ser vices of employees in other foreign business houses of the interpreters to other Foreign Ministers. I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of protecting the American line of steamers now plying between Son Francisco, Japan, and China, and the Australian line, almost our only remaining line of ocean steamers, and of increasing their THE NATIONAL DEBT TARIFF AND REVENUE. The national debt has been reduced to tbe of of extent of eighty-six millions fifty-seven thous and one hundred and twenty-en dollars and eighty cents during the year, and by the ne gotiations of national bonds at lower rate of interest, the interest on the public debt bos been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for interest account is nearly seventeen million dollars less than on the fist of March, 1869. It was highly desirable that this rapid I diminuation should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens of their entire atjiiity to meet every dollar of liability without bank rupting them. But, in view of the resources of the country, its increasing ability to meet large demands, and the amout already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to keep np this rapid payment I there fore recommend a modification of the tariff and international tax laws. I rocommend that ait taxes from Internal sources be abolished, except upon spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors, and tobacco in its various forms, from stamp. In re-adjusting the tariff, I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue eoilected under the present laws, after providing for the current expenses of the government, the interest account, and a sinking fund; and that this surplus be re duced in such manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest nnmber. There are many articles not produced at home, such as medicines, compounds, fec., &., from which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into general use. All such articles I recom mend it to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend it be made upon those arti cles which can bear it without disturbing home production or reducing wages of Ameri can labor. I have not entered into figures, be cause to do so would be to repeat all that is laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. PAY 

COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS. The present laws for collecting revenues, pay collectors of customs small salaries but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at the principal ports of entry, particularly, raise the compensation of these officials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me that this system must at times work peniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such get possession of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny ol goods entered, to enaoie tnem finally to make large seizures. Your attention is repectfully invited to this subject. THE 

CURRENCY QUESTION. Continued fluctuations in the value of gold, compared with the national currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of the country in keeping prices of all articles necessary in every day life. It fosters a spirit of grumbling, prejudicial alike to the national morals and national nuances. If the Question can be met so as to secure a fixed value to currency, that value constantly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very aesiraoie ooject win ue guinea. THE ARMY. For the operations of the army in the past year, the expense of maintaining it, the esti mates for the ensuing year, and continuing sea cost and other improvements, conducted under the supervision of tne AY ar Department, 1 refer you to the accompanying report ot tho Secretary of War. I call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress, approved March 3, 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the army until provided for by law. I recommend that the number of o Seers in each grade of staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number in any one grade tails below tne number so nxed, that tne va cancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. Also, I recommend that when the office of Chief of Corps becomes vacant, it may be filled by selection from the corps in wnicn tne vacancy occurs. THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number and ethciency of the naval force, without material increase in the expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted and is being extended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By these means we have been enabled to oc cupy at once a large extent of cruis ing ground and to visit more. Frequently the posts where the presence of our flag is desirable and generally to discharge more effici ently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace, without ex ceeding the number of men or ex penditures authorized by law, during the past year, the navy has, in addi tion to its regular service, supplied the men and officers for the vessels of the coast survey and has complet ed the surveys, authorized by Con gress, of the Isthmus of Darien and Tehuantepec, and under like author ity has sent out an expedition com pletely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the North. The suggestions of the re port as to the necessity lor increas ing and improving the material of the navy and the plcn recommenced for reducing the personnel of the service to a peace standard by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the employment of some in the service of the Commercial Marine, are well considered and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress. I also recommend that all promotions in the navy above the rank of cap taincy, be by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure, in the higher grades, greater efficien cy, and hold out an incentive to young officers to improve themselves in the knowledge oi their profession. The present cost of maintaining the navy, its cost compared witn tnat ot the preceeding year, and the esti mates for the ensuing year, are con tained in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Tsavy. 

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The enlarged receipts of the Fost Office Department, as shown by the accompanying report of tho Post master General, exhibits a gratifying increase in that branch ot the ser vice. It is tne index ot tne grow tn of education and of the prosperity of the people, two elements highly con ducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With a vast territory ike ours, much ot it recently popu lated. but all requiring the services of the mail it is not at present to be expected that this Department can aaae sell-sustaining, Dut a gra dual approach to this end, from year to year, is confidently relied on and the day is not far distant when the Fost Office Department of the gov ernment will prove a mufh greater blessing to the people than it is now. The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in the De partment provided over by him, are earnestly recommended to 3rour spe cial attention. Especially do I re commend to your favorable consid eration the plan for uniting the tel egraph system of the United States with the postal s'stem. It is be lieved bv such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced and the service as well if not better rendered. It would secure the fur ther advantange by extending the telegraph through portions of the country where private enterprises will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated into community of interests, are always enefitted by a rapid intercommuni cation. Education, the ground work Republican institutions, is en couraged by increasing the facilities for information, together with the advantages resulting from obtaining - 3 r -11 i . f . 1 try the desire tOfeap the benefits of such improvements will stiim.It? ed ucation. I refer you to the report of tne Postmaster-General for full de tails of the operations of last year, and for the comparative statements results with former years. There has been imposed upon the government the execution of the act Congress, approved April 20th, 1871, and commonly known as the "Ku-Klux Law,' in a portion of the State of South Carolina. The neces sity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the committee appointed to investigate Southern outrages. Under the pro visions of the above act, I issued a proclamation, calling the attention it ot of be the of the people of the United States to the same and declaring my reluc tance to exercise any of the extraor dinary powers thereby conferred up on men, except in case of imperative necessity, but making known my purpose to - exercise sucn power whenever it should become necessary to do so, for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the constitu tion and the laws. After the passage of this law in formation was received, from time to time, tbat combinations of the character referred to in its provisions existed and were powerful in many parts of the Southern States, partic ularly in certain counties in the State of South Carolina. Careful investi gation was made and it was ascer tained that in nine counties of that State such combinations were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local authority; and having, among other things object of depriving the emancipated class of the sub stantial benefits of freedom and of preventing free political action of those citizens whodid not sympathize with their own views. Among their operations, were frequent scourgings and occasional assassinations, gener ally perpetrated at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different po litical sentiments from their own, or free persons who had shown a dispo position to claim equal rights with other citizens. lhousands of in offensive and well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless vi olence. Thereupon, on the 13th of Octo ber, 1871, a proclamation was issued in the terms of the law, calling upon the members of such combinations to disperse within five daj-s, and to deliver to the marshal or military officers of the United States all arms ammunitions, uniforms, disguises and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful purposes. This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another proclamation was issued, suspending the priv ilege of the writ of habeas corpus in nine counties. In that, direction was given that within the counties so designated, persons supposed, up on creditable information, to be members of such unlawful combina tions should be arrested by the mil itary forces of the United States, and delivered to the Marshal to be dealt with according to law. In two of said counties (York and Spar tansburg,) many arrests have been made. At the last account, the number of persons thus arrested was 168.- beveral hundred, whose crim inality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, were released for the present. These have generally mady conlessions of their guilt Great caution has been exercised in making test arrests; and notwith standing the large number, it is be lievea no innocent person is now in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial before judicial tribunals of the United States. As. soon as it appeared that the author! ties of the United States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and there is good ground for sup posing that all of such persons have violated the law. A full report of what has been done under this law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General.
