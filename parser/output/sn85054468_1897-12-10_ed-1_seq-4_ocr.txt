Fill DAY, 

DECEMBER 10,1897- Uemocrntic Policy ns. to Hawaii. ir Uhs majority of DcHttcrata in the Satiate have deurnaiipd to oppose Ha waiian annexation upon Un? ground that in recent timet; die project was proposed first Jty a Republican President, and now is being urged by another and that is the only ascertainable bais for the opposition tfcat we can find then the Senators in volved are making a sad mistake. It they should succeed a great his torical Idot would be placed upon the Democratic party organization. The Dsmo oratlc party which carried the purchas-c of Louisiana against very much the same ar.ru TBontn and opposition as now are arrayed against normal and iieeessary American expaus-lan, sliould not be the. party to pre vent tlie annexation of Haw-ill nor any of tlie naturally American Mauds surround ingus. As to Hawaii, it only is necessary to glanoe at Uie map. not long ago pub libe3 by the Navy Department, tn fee that tbe gcaup has been placed by nature well within the proper sphere of our control. It is man j degrees east of the latitude of our northernmost possesions. The geo graphical position of the inlands alone ren ders tbcm the natural outpost of our Pacific Coast defense: while their natural r-eseuroes. and tbe Commercial position their acquisition would give us in the future trade of the world, after the opening- of an Intcr-oceanle canal, make their possession vital to our position among tbe great pew ors of earth. Oa a question like tWt it would be unpatriotic to draw party lines. An intrinsically good thing Awn not become less so because it happen to be proposed by a party or a President usually opposed to national interests. As jnatters stand there are two Demo-orats- in the Senate whose views r.nd oMtne in the- matter of Hawaiian anuex attoc it is perfectly safe to follow, and they are Senators Morgan and Gorman. If the opposing! in the Senate should be too tfiro-nr to overcome, and it should be dttoided to bring the matter before both hanpc- through the Morgan annexation rohelaiioit. ttadse remarks will ttpply equally to tie DcnMfCratic metntiers of the Hoase of Rlrciittives. The- New York Bieyele Knc-o. It ha ordinarily been supposed that mr fjanUy is clviUzed. The idea or cor Uttpertor humanity, gentleness and doilCHey of feeling is one to which many poapte oiing with a otoilditke and pathetic faibli. it- pite of ome anhappy facts on the other Ide. AVc think that Spanish bII ftglts are horrible things, and never to their., unless we happen to be trav eling in Spain sometimes not then. We i(Kk ar the-shrunken and withered bodies of the ermlts of India as evidences of hot! Ircni.-.tn, and we do not approve of bour-baitliig, or cock-fighting, or rat huuis. Bat, in view of the long-distance bicycle riding at present going on in th Madisun Square pardon, in New York City, this nuppy seK-compNcence will be seriously interfered with. In this wheeling -contest eighteen nkter are striving to see how fast anil how far n nran can tra-vel on a birycle in six days without dying or going mad. The obflnoes ate that some f tbem will die and home of them will go mad leforc the end of it, aud others will cniwl through life, sane, but with nerves shattered and hoalth ruined, so that paralysis or insanity would be almost a blessed relief. To this pleasing spectacle men and women are admitted at fifty cents a bead.and to theft- shame, bo it said, they com". They are drawn by exactly the same motives that led the Roman population to a gladia ttortal Uiow, and the half savage people of the middle apes to see a man tortured and burned for bis religion. These mo tives would disgrace a respectable wolf, for wolve. when they nave occasion to kill a man, do not appoint one wolf to tor ture him- to death and then sit around in a ring to enjoy the eight and bet; on the chances- of the victim. The worst tor tures of the inquisition, the most fier.d-lsb-punishments of Cliitmso statute-books, ar prodnreri by Jaok of'slepp, ami tl'csc exhausted wheelmen hnvebad onlv stw.rt r v " fee nap.s at the longest possible intervals since tbo ridhuj began. Some have beggr-d pitifully for sleep, but have been clubbed and threatened by their trainers and fbiccd to' keep on riding. A J'rerjch rider went rearly mad, and declared that he would nonreturn to the track, becnube his life ,ras woith more to him than a thousandxEsnars. At least the papers said that he wentroad-wheu he made that decla ration, but it may be tl'at he was otily ex periencing 41 gleam of sauity. There is aL-othr riJer who.is alwajw talking to himself, arwi seeing friends who arc not piesent, and delusions and hallucinations are common among the tontastunts. The men look lite tiBcn cerpfes, who, to put it mildly, have not been in heaven. It is not Uie fault of the riders- The worst that can be said of them is that they lucked ordinary good sense or they would not have entered suoh a contest, It is the fault of the managers, and of the public, which makes such a show profit able. So It ng as there is money to be made out of human suffering there will always be men cfllotts enough to utilixe the suffering for their own advantage. The responsibility i6 with the public. There should, in u decent community, be no de inuiul for such an exhibition as this, and if there is a demandfor it, it should be pro hibited by law , just as other barbarous exhibitions are prohibited by law. fommiss.oner Morrison. The terra of oirice of Col. William P.. Morrison, a Interstate Commerce Commls fiioner, will end on die first day of Janu ary next. As the place is a remunerative oiie.it is very natural that there should be a scramble for it, and that many virtuous and patriotic sen tlenuinshouldseek it with out much reference to the distinguished abilities, the merits or the deserts of tlie present incumbent. That is where they are wrong; becaase, if Col. Morrison has any d.-dre to succeed himself there ought not to be the slightest doubt concerning his reappointment oy the President. They were old fellow-members and! riendsln the Ilouseuf Representatives, and, as long as Mr.McKinley is obliged to put a Democrat in the position, it would k be very strange indeed if he went beyond Col. Morrison to find onj. Europe aiid Americanism. In Thursday's morning cditl-m The Times printed a news article containing some interesting matter referring to the fotewist of international political move ment which Mr. ICceney, president of the League of Sliver Clubs, furnished to this Journal lust July. Then, Mr.Keeney said what The Times has contended for from its first ifcsue under the present manage ment, that the ability ot America to pro duce a commercial surplus of natural and manufactured commodities, before long would precipitate a struggle for existence between this country and the nations of Hke productions in Europe. Mr. Kecney wrote: "It is conceded by the ablest European statisticians that this country has the productive energy of .my three of the great European powers com bined, 'ihat means that Ave have the natural, or latent power, to bu&tain j.ir selves as u nation against any combinations of European capital in peace or war. T'io very existence of American institutions Is a standing menace to the tottering thrones of Europe." Continuing, Mr. .Kecney argued that the resumption of the bimetallic standard by us would Increase the world's volume or money,? nd, with our productive energy, would force Europe to bimetallism. The views of The Times and of Mr Keeney have recently ieceivedj"emir;rable corroboration at the bauds ot Count Goln chowsky, Austrian minister of foreign ar fairs. ne has said that what Europe most baa to fear Is a Pan-American bi metallic union, with the silver dollar the recognized money unit from the North Tole to I'atagoniai aud lie urges the govern ments of the old world to stand shoulder to shoulder to prevent that eventuality. From his own point of view, Count Golucbowsky no doubt is right. The menace of Tan-American bimetallism is the nightmare of Europe today. If it viT3 not so w should not find the agencies of European fiuancial and political interests in Washington this winter, ready to spend millions in attempting to defeat every measure before tbe Congress calculated to promote tile growtli or protection of f tit ire American commerce, and to secure the im position upon our nation of the European gold standard. There Is a vast danger to the Americtn masses in their indisposition to look upon questions of finance, commerce and the w.orld-wide lelations and frictions they in volve, from an international as well as from a national standpoint. It is plain enough to the comprehension of the average citizen that Pan-American bimetallism, for example, would place this hemisphere in a position to control the future trade Jf the planet-' It is harder to inculcate the lesson that that ability will bs crushed out unless American control of the Hawaiian Islands, the keyo' Hie Pacific, or the tmns-iythmtau anal, and of the Antilles, is included In .lie scheme; and further that, without a great navy, we ctnnot enjoy any of these possessions- nor hope to build up and. protect the commerce which our situation In domination over these trade factors would render feasiblo. "We must pull ourselves together and open our eves to the advantages, aud aiso to the dangers, that appear upon our na tional horizon. Whether in the lobby this winter, or in more hostile mcvemjuts a little later on, there is not a sche ne or plan of national expansion which will not be met by the money, or if that fails, ultimately by the gunsof otherpowers :'ow rcgardinir our productive aid comme-?iol possibilities with Jealous and angry eyoi. A bating n Nuisnnco. A wonderful scheme has been developed in New York, and its possibilities, as one reflects on their novel and unique clar acrer, impress one more and more with the idea that the world is growing wise, and that there is some hope that Jn the course of a fow centuries there will not be so mnny born idiots, aud born fools, with just enough wit to get in other people's way. as there are now. Condi tions will be improved, aud man will have some chance to improve himself, instead of using up,the gray matter of lite brain I in devisingjncw forms of profanity. This scheme is one which .has to do j with the abolition of noise. Magnetism. and somotln?rOiIngart5 called into play, and the result is that, as- fast asthe nolspjs made,.it is. collected-and solidified? and dropped into the river In the form ofliuge chunks of silence. The geom itrlcal form and variegated colors of these chunks may be subject to a law not yet investi gated, but that will come later. The nu'in point is thut the nofse Is destroyed. Newsboys call their papers, trucks nimble over the pavement, maidens play the piano anl youths, toot on the corn-jt, but it is all transformed instantly into large blocks of tllcnne. Possibly this was what; was mconfc by a Chicago paper which not long ago said that a train thundered In silence, and was made unmerciful fun of by. all the other papers in town on that account. Thii poor, maligned journal may simply have been ahead of the procession. Uut the really great feature of this discovery seems not to hac been si en by the inventor. It is the only thing yet found which could possibly muzzle Chaun cey M. Dupew. Depew's after-dinuer speeches began In his early infancy, and bi'vo continued without intermission until the present day. His mouth is awike and on duty during every hour of the twenty-lour. 13von in the dead watches of the night, that mouth never runs down. It is seriouslv thought by eme people that tlfe malaria of the New Jersey marshes may be due to the c n tinual draining into them o .Mr. Depew's eloquence. There is no knowing what influence he nay have had on the New i'otk atmosphere. Several things have been suspected of the New York t.tmos phetc, things which caused actorB and authors to say bad words, but it lias iievet been known just what was the matter with it. If some arrangement car. be made by, which Dspew will shed around him huge chunks, of silence m place of his present ,output, and Sf as suitnee can be given that these chunks will nevei dissolve in water, they '.-an be carried out to sea and dumped there, and that will be the end of them. The e-rense to the city will be sltgiit and the benefit enormous, even if the ch inks should have to be cremated or buried. New York will then have a chance to analyze her atmosphere and see what realiy ulB it, and there will be ;ieacc. and joy, and rest on the ImIo of Man batiun. As si. further object lesson of McKin ley prosperity, the Cotton Manufacturers' Association of Fall River has dectd-id to cut down wages ten per cent or more. Gold monometallism has depressed the purchasing power of the people by doub lings the amount of labor or productions necessary to give in exchange fora dollar. It is the same here and in Europe. The gold standard everywhere means a re duction or wages and slavery to all vork ers. Sccretarj Gage wants" an appropriation from the Congress for a: bicycle died. If he will use it to store the finaacial wheels at piesent In .bis head, the $2, 000 asked would "be cheap at half the price. In his report for 1897, Mr. John Il3-d.e, statistician of tbe Department of Agri culture, urges the propriety of giving-the statistical division of that department a bureau organization. The Buraiu of Statistics of the Treasury Department, with an a pproprlation of $4.0, 3H0, end employing on" j 3G persons, is a f ull-fledgd "bureau;" while the similar office In the Agricultural Department, with an ap propriation this year of $145,100, -and. employing 127 salaried employes, la only a "division." There is good sense in' Mr. Hyde's suggestion. Hawaiian annexation is not a pill and doesn't need sugar-coating'. It Is a pity that the situation seems to Indicate a necessity that Democracy should make our relntious with Spiin and Cuba a party question. In the past we have dated to hope that in a master so plainly involving- a national duty, all American legislators might unite to compel iccognlUon of the demand whl'ih Americans generally have been making fora year past; that our Government should drop its infamous alliance with Spain agalnat human liberty and common hu manity, and lecognize the belligerency of Uie Cuban Republic. But if Repjb Hcanlsm is blind and deaf to such 'deas, it cannot be helped. Thank heaven that Democracy everywhere is for freedom! The eight-hour movement was a con spicuous tuccess at Port au Prince. Guldcnsuppe has been buried. Now If, some one will throw all recent copies of New York newspapers In a hole and put ashes en them, the work of disinfection will have properly begun. A Japanese statesman says the adoption of the new civilization has not improved the condition of Japanese workingmen. It will be remembered that contraction of the currency followod bard upon the new civilization. Kentuckians don't much mind the waste of words 1 1 is tha'Waste of good liquor in connection with the battleship christening thai causes them to" look askance upon the whole proceeding-, If Mr. Hanna had Just granted autonomy to Mr. MeKinley's mind things might have been different. Gcrman'American citizens who contem plate visiting Haiti will probably consider the advisability of burning thelmaturaliza tion bridges behind them. A Thrifty Congressman. (From the Kansas City .Journal.) Tbe Populist paper at Lincoln gives some account of the prosperity which lias come to Uncle Billy Baker, the pleasant old fel low who for three terms represented the Sixth district in Congress. He has two fine farms, upon one of which he is feeding 250 bead ot cattle, and, besides, he owns and occupies a fine home in the town. Uncle Billy demonstrated the error of the belief that a Congressman could not live decently and save money out or his salary nis expenses in Washington were but lit tle, if any, more than the excess sum al lowed him for mileage and postage, and had it not been for the necessity of con tributlng liberally to the campaign fund in his district, he might have saved nearly" the whole or his salary of $5,000 a year. He wa a poor man when he entered Con gress, and hcl3 now worth about $17,000i Sarcastic Papa. (From the Detroit Free Press.)

In the near future. He smiled and. replied: "Ask. me something ci&Ry." There are several bills prepared for the Foreign Relations Com mittee, but whether they will ever see daj light Republicans of prominence are unable to tell. Senator White, one ot the strongtsst op ponents ot tbcHawuiian annexation treaty, now claims the treaty will be defeated by not less than eleven majority !n the Senate. He also makes the poln? tl-at every Senator supposed to favor the Sugar Tiust, or charged with favoring that gigantic corporation, is an annexation ist and this, he says, in the face of the fact which has been printed far ami wide that the Sugar Trust people are Colng all in their power to prevent the ratifica Uoii of the treaty. Theie were whispers about the corridors of the House yesterday to the effect thut aci.ucus wlllsoou beheld by the Democrats .V. which will be discussed the advisability ot making a direct issue with Speaker Reed lelatlve to the Cuban question. It Is believed " that the Democrats in favor ot such a plan sofai outnumber thelJemo crats who do not, that it will be :-asy to make It a caucus' measure and to Insist "that .the, Cuban resolution Jm- considered. If this plan sliould not carry because of the opposition ot the President and the Speaker, it will 'be proposed to make it an issue before, the country. The resolution has already, passml the Senate, and if , the Democrats can obtain enough Republican votes in the House to pass it, the President will be compelled toeitherjapproTJJQf veto it. LeadingDcmo-crats-believe tli.it a veto would make the President so unpopular that it would re sult in linking the House Democratic in the next Congress. Prominent Itepublicnn Congressmen are now of, the opinion that no legislation will be necessary' to authorial the Secre tary of the Treasury to withhold from circulation, except when reissued for gold, greei.biidksrthat have been riMleemed in gold. It is therefore probable that the legislation relative to the contraction of thecurrency.us requested by the PiesMent, wiil not be undertaken. Congressman William A. Stone, a veteran of the war, went tn the rescue of au old comrade Wednesday, whom he fonud in trouble with a policeman iu the rotunda at the Capitol. The veteran had paint.illy hobbled up the stairway to the room, and out of breath, had seated himself on one of the half dozen benches reset ved for women- No' other benches were unoccu pied. The policeman on duty ordered tr.e veteran to leave the bench, and wnen the latter protesteil that he was too exhausted, and the officer wasabout to oust him, Con gressman Stone came along. He ascertained the nature of the trouble and directed the policeman to let the old man rest. He also said he would have the sign "reserved for ladies" removed from the back ot the seats, and he did so. The House Committee on Indian Affairs will begin at once the pieparatlon ot an appropriation bill, and it is expected that It will be readv for submission to the House during the month of January. The Senate subcommittee on Indian Affairs, -at its meeting yesterday, avis authorized to prepare a bill to meet che necessities of the Indian question. This subject has been long under consideration and it is expected that some satisfactory measure will be passed during the present cession. Senatoi Gallinger says that he is op posed to- the granting of large pensions to widows oi distinguished otflcers. He declares the limit in that respect has been reached. Appropriation bill? will be disposed of by the House as vapidly as they are rc poited. This is- apparently the unani mous cplnlon of the Republican leaders. Other bills will be given consideration after this work ha been done, butit is piobnhlc that tliey will not be reached until after the holiday recess. It was said yesterday that the Committee on Bonking and Corrency will be unable to agree on a measure, and that as soon as the failure to do so is admitted, the Ways and Means Committee will piep-tre a fiuancial bill which will meet the ap proval of 'Uie Presldeut. The bankruptcy bill will be given nn earlv date for a hearing. It will be on the lines or the did Toi'rey bill providing for both voluntary and Involuntary bank ruptcy.

FOHKIGN AFFAIRS COMMfrTEE. SnlK'omiiiittPe Apin.i.itrd and IVlngie Sealing! riscussed. When the Houe Committee on Foreign Relations meL yesterday nearly all of the mombers were present. Chairman Hitt, almost immediately after calling the com mittee to order, announced subcommittees as follows: Cubai. Affairs Adams ot Pennsylvania, Ileal wole of Minnesota, and Berry of Ken tucky. Hewaiian Aff airs-Hltt ot Illinois, Smith or Micliigan, and Blnsmore ot Arkansas. Nearly the entire time of the wmmltteB was taken up In adl.-cusstouof the scaling quf'Sticn- It wa- shown by Mr. Adams that Uils Government, by the course alxjut to bi- pursued, was placing restrlcUons on its citizen?, aad that other nations v ere at liberty to poach without restraint- In reply u this Mr. Adams was informed lliat this policy was being pursued to remove the objf-ct ion.-, offered by other nations against a suspension of pelagic seal fHhlng. It was determined, however, to report; at an early date a bill prohibiting: American citizens- frotti taking part In pelagic sealing in B- bripg Sea, and to push the bill to its fiiia' imssnge, if possible, before the holi days. The members ot the committee will call oir Secretary Sherman today at 11 o'clock to discuss the matter with him. The Morgan, joint resolution relative to Cuba and a number or bills, all relating to CiiImi, were hastily looked over, but no disposition of them was made by the committee. There were ar&o a number of proposed measures concerning Hawaii, which wpre merelyreferredto, but not considered. One of these bills was presented by Mr. Sulzer. which provides for making Hawaii a terri tory and assuming its debt 1 o the amount ot $4,000,000. It provides, also, for five comndssioners to recommend a plan of gov ernment for the Island. A bill has also been d-awn by Mr. King of Utah, wltisli very much resembles that of Congressman Sulzer. Congressman Spauldlng's bill pro poses that Hawaii be created a state, with one representative In Congress. The committee will, as scon as possible, act on the demand for an investigation ot the consular and diplomatic system, made by Mr. McCall, ot Massachusetts. Mr. Beach's bill, proposing a general call by the President for a conference at Wash ington to secure general acceptance of the Monroe doctrine, is likewise a measure that will receive the committee's atten tion, but it is believed that an adverse report will be made. A bill, submitted bj Mr. Barrett, ot Massachusetts, authoriz ing the Trcident to arrange an inter national conference to settle boundary disputes, and a bill by Mr. Smith, pro posing a conference of American Re publics to adopt arbitration and to ex tend commercial relations will al&o be acted on by the committee, after the sub committees to whom they wore -eforred report back. A Xew Burglar Trap. (From the Chicago Time3-Uemid.) The other "night a bold, bad burglar entered the apartments of Mrs. O'Leary, on Wabash avenue, with felonious intent and a jimmy. A few minutes later Mrs. O'Leary tnrned him over to a policeman on the corner and ordered him locked up. When the pood woman was interviewed by an? admiring neighbor concerning her prowess ard was asked how she con quered her unwelcome visitor, she re plied nonchalantly: "Oh, I just hngged I him:" That tells the whole story. What burg lar with the least spark of innnhjod In I his composition could resist under such circumstances? How could lie think- of f escape? How could he proceed wltli. his nefarious plans? Whafc could he do but submit gracefully to the inevitable? With apologies to Mr. Bulwer. there are times f when the hug is mightier than tin pen. t Th. up-to-date burglar should also note that if he encounters the former he is quit- likely to do time in the latter. Sanitary Jnstice. From the Philadelphia Record.! A Wisconsin Jury has awarded S&,0f)0 damages (o a widow who sued the Ash land Watpr Company for furnishing through its pipes Impure water containing typhoid fever germs, and thus oiusiugthe death ot her husband. This is a npw de parture, which involves a penetration of salutary sanitary justice into the realm of jurisprudence. The wafer company which purveys poisonous water should be t eld , liable for dmnaires, precisely as we hold the butcher who sella rotten beefsteak or the drucgist whe careles-fy puts up death de.'dingpn3crIprions. This Wisconsin jury may n.r be sustained In Its finding upon appall but In any event it ha blazed the way for legislation.

The daily average of books in the handsof reauera may be placed at 3.000, but ;b:s varies, as the number taken out during the session of Congress is. much larger thin during the reces. The percentage of books lost In thirty years is about Cive to a thousand The books are arranged in the new Library with regard to conveniaue of access and speedy service. Bookd which experience had shown to be most sought for were placed on shelves near the read ing room. OrthcrratterofappolntmenLs, Mr. Young Eays that none was made untilafter the books had all been removed to the new building- This was done in order that the Library in its reorganization might have efficient service. To aid in tlus a bxird was appointed to select well-qualified persons for the various positions. These selections are attended by some em barrassment, because of the technical knowledge required In many departroents. What Increased the embarrassment was that, as a rule, the tbouand3 of appli cations represented meritorious and ac complished reoplfc, with the highest recom mendations, but lacking in requisite ex perience. Twer, ty-f ive per cent of the appointments consisted of women With few exceptions, women had not had service In the Library and, therefore, the nominations were an ex periment. In the administration of other libraries the experiment has been success ful, but so far as this Library is con cerned the appointment ot wemen Is still an experiment. Fivr employes who have done good service have been retired because of super annuation . Thelibrarianregretstliavtnere is no provision in the law for pensioning them.

Librarian Young dwells-at considerable length upon the subject of those that have accesvfj the Library, and advi.stnut the access to the same should be more rigid than it now is. He gives the list of those who are new enti tied t obtain books frcrn theshelvs, and suggests that there should ben national library, wherein the literature of thepeopln will be guarded. An increase in appropriation for the purchase of for el gn works. i urged, in order to-bring the Library up tc tin standard that it should occupy as a national library.
