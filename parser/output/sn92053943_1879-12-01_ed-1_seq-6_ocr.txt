brt received by this Government in excess of strictly jnst demands, should in some form be returned to tbe nations to whom it eqnitably belongs. Tbe Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the question of tbe emigration of its subjects to the United States with a'dispassionate fairness, and to co-operate in such measures as may tend to prevent injurious consequences to the jllnited States. Tbe negotiations are still proceeding, and will be pressed with dili gence. A question having risen, between China and Japan about the Lew Chew Islands, the United States government has taken measures to inform those powers of its readiness to extend its good offices for the maintenance of peace, if they shall mu tually deem it desirable, and find it practi cable to avail themselves of the proger. THE MEXICAN BORDER AND AWARDS. It is a gratification to be able to an nounce that, through the judicious and energetic action of the military comman ders of tbe two nations on each side of the Ilio Grande, under the instructions of their respective governments, raids and depreda tions have greatly decreased, and, in the localities where formerly most destructive, Lave now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a confident ex pectation that the prevalence of quiet on tbe border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present or ders to our military commanders as to crossing the border, without encouraging suoh disturbances as would endanger the -ece of the two countries. The third instalment of the award Hcrtinst Mexico under the Claims Commis si. n of July 4,1868, was duly paid, and ) .ts been put in course of distribution in rursuance of the act of Congress provid ing for the same. This satisfactory situa tion between the two countries leads me to jutticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increased contribution of 'pital and industry by our people to the development of the great resources of that f'ountry. I earnestly commend to the wis dom of Congress the provision of suitable legislation looking to this result. CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again restored by the arrival of a minister from that country to the United States. This is especially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an inter-oceanic canal has recently assumed a new and im portant aspect, and is now under discussion with the Central American countries through whose territory the canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightened statesmanship on their part will see that the early prosecu tion of such a work will largely enure to the benefit, not only of their own citizens and those of the United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted that should the work be uuderta ken under the protective auspices of the United States, and upon satisfactory con cessions for the right of way, and its secu rity, by tbe Central American govern ments, the capital lor its completion would be readily furnished from this country and Europe, which might, failing such guaran tees, prove inaccessible. Diplomatic relations with Chili have also been strengthened by the reception of a minister from that country. OCR SOUTH AMERICAN RELATIONS. The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chili still continues. The United States have not deemed it propsr to interpose in the mather, further than to convey all the Ooverments concerned, the assurance that the friendly offices of the Government of the United for the restoration of peace and upon an honorable basis will be extended, in case the belligerents 6hall exhibit a read iness to accept them. cordial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, and trade with those countries is improving. A provi sion for regular and more frequent mail communication, in our own ships, between the ports of this country and the nations of routh America seems to me to deserve the attention of Congress, as an essential pre cursor of an enlargement of our commerce w ith them, and an extension of our carry ing trade. A recent revolution in Venezuela has been followed by the establishment of a provisional government. This government 1ms not yet been formally recognized, and i. i? deemed desirable to await the pro-po.-ed action of the people, which is ex pected to give it the sanction of constitu tional forms. THE SAMOAN ISLANDS. A naval vessel has been sent to the Sa rnoan Islands, to make surveys and take possession of the privileges ceded to the United States by Samoa, in the harbor of Pago Pago. A coaling-station is to be es tablished there, whichwiU be convenient and useful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic rela tions with Roumania and Servia, now be come independent sovereignties, is at pres ent under consideration, and is tbe subject of diplomatic correspondence. INCREASE OF TRADE. There is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and American countries, and it is believed that with judic ious action in regard to its development ft can and will be still more enhanced, and tbnt American products and manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers upon this subject, under the system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining much valuable information, which has been and will continue to be laid before Congress and the public from time to time. OOVERXlf ENT FOR ALASKA. Th third article of the treaty with Rus sia, of March 30, 18C7, by which Alaska was ceded, to the United States, provides that the inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the exception of the uncivilized tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States, and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may from time to time adopt in regard to the aboriginal tribes cf that country.; Both the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people, require that some organized form of government over the Territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with common law of fences, such as assault, robbery, and mur der, and no magistrate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from of fences of this character, not only among the original inhabitants, but among citi zens of the United States and other coun tries, who have engaged in mining, fish ing, and other business operations within the Territory. A bill authorizing the ap pointment of justices of the peace and con stables, and the arrest and detention of per sons charged with criminal offences, and providing for .an appeal to the United States courts for the district of Oregon, in suitable cases, will, at a proper time, be submitted to Congress.

The attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, were $273,827,184 46; the ordinary expen ditures for the same period were $268,947, 863.53; leaving a surplus revenue for the year ot $6,879,300.93. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, actual and estimat ed, are as follows : Actual receipts for the first quarter, commencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimated receipts for the remaining three-quarters of the year, $208,156,336 39; total receipts for the cur rent fltcal year, actual tnd estimated, $288,000,000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as lollows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures, $91,683,385.10; and for the remaining three-quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at $172 316.614 90 making the total expend itures $264,000,000, and leaving an esti mated surplus revenue for the vear ending June 30, 1880, of $24,000,000." The total receeipts during the next fiscal year end ine June 30, 1881, estimated according to existing laws, will be $288,000,000; and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be $278,097,863.30 leav ing a surplus of $9,903,635.61 for that year. The large amount expended for arrears of pensions during the last and the present fiscal vear, amounting to $21,747,249.60, has prevented the application ot the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for the current year; but these arrears having been substantially paid, it is be Jieved that the sinking-fund can hereafter be maintained without a change ot exist ing laws. WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380, 428 92, the same being for a less sum ot money than any annual estimates rendered to Congress from that Department during a period of at least twelve years. lie concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such legislation as will authorize the enlistment of the full number of twenty-flve thousand men for the line of the Army, exclusive of the three thou sand four hundred and sixty-three men required for detached duty, and therefore not available for service in the field. He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for the disposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and reservations, wnich, though very valuable in themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civilization and settlement. He unites with the Quartermaster Gen eral in recommending that an appropria tion be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire-proof building for tbe safe storage of a vast amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims, and other val uable records now in the Quartermaster General's office, and exposed to great risk of total destruction by fire. He also recommends, in conformity with the views of the Judge-Advocate General, some declaratory legislation in reference to the military statute ot limitations as ap plied to the crime of desertion. In these several recommendations I concur. - THE MlSSISSim 

JETTIES. The Secretary of War further reports, that the work for the improvement of the South Pa3s of the Mississippi river, under contract with Mr. James B. Eads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of success in the attain ment of results than during any previous year. The channel through the South Pass, which, at the beginning ot operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only seven and one-halt teet of water, had, on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth ot twenty six feet, having a width of not less than two hundred teet and a central depth of thirty feet. Payments have been made in accordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,250,000; and fnrtner payments will become due, as provided by the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the channel now secured. ARMY REPORTS AND OFFICES. The reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates, present a full and detailed account of the military operations for the suppression of hostilities among the Indians of tbe Ute and Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the officers and troops engaged, for promptness.skill andcouragedisplayed. The past year ha3 been one of almost un broken peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of this Government and of Mex ico, to maintain order in that region, will prove permanently successful. This Department was enabled during tbe past year to find temporary though crowded accommodations, and a safe depository for a portion of its records, in the completed east wing of the building, designed tor the State, War and Navy Departments. The construction of the north wing of the build ing, a part of the structure intended for the use of the War Departments being carried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal appropriations as will secure its speedy completion. KAVY DEPARTMENT. The report ot the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement in that branch oi the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ship3 have been Lsompleted and made ready for sea. The total expenditures oi tne year enueu June 30, 1879, including specific appropri ations not estimated for by the Department, were $13,555,710 09. The expenses charge able to the year,alter deducting the amount of these specific appropriations, were $13,343,317.79 ;but this is subject to a reduc tion of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of ap propriations applicable to the laat fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was.there fore, a balance of $1,479,054 37 remaining unexpended, and to the credit of the De partment, on June 30, 1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $14,864,147.95, which exceeds the appro priations tor the present fiscal year $361, 897.28. The reason for this increase is explained in the Secretary's report. The appropriations available for the present fiscal year are $14,502,250.67, which will, in the opinion oi the Secretary, answer all the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the Treasury from J uly 1 to November 1. 1879, was $5,770,402 12, of which $1,095,440 33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,674,06 J. 79. if the expenditures of the remaining two thirds of the year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, there will remain unexpended, at the end of the year. $477.359 30 of the current ' appropriations.

Praise from Sir Hubert tary shows the gratifying fact that among all the disbursiug officers of the pay corps of the Navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite vith him in recommending the re moval of the Observatory to a more health ful location. That institution reflects credit upon tbe Nation, and has obtained the ap probation of scientific men in all parUof the world. Its removal from its present location would not only be conducive to the health ot its officers and professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness. DEPARTMEHT OF JUSTICE. The appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been made for the De partment ot Justice, in gross, was subdi vided at the last - session of Congress, and no appropriations whatever was made for the payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the service of pro cess or for the discharge of other duties; and since June 30, these officers have con tinued their duties without compensation from the Government, taking upon them selves the necessary incidental outlays, as well as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable Instances, has the proper execution of the process ot the United States failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriation. This course of official conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the Attorney-General, who informed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely for their compen sation upon the prospect of future legisla tion by Congress. I therefore especially recommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose. PROTECTION OP THE BAT. LOT. The act making the principal appropria tion for the department of Justice at pre vious sessions has uniformly contained the following clause: "And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the en forcement of the act approved February, 28, 1870, entitled 'An act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled 'An act to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of the United States, and for other purposes,' or any acts amendatory thereof or supplemen tary thereto.' " No appropriation was made for this pur pose for the current year. As no general election for members ot Cangress occurred, the ommission was a matter of little practi cal importance. Such election will, how ever, take place during the ensuing year, and the appropriation made for the pay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such elections. THE OVER CROWDED COURTS. The business of the Supreme Court is, at present, largely in arrears. It cannot be expected that more causes can be decided than are now disposed of in its annual ses sion, or that by any assiduity the distin guished magistrates who compose the Court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits, also, the business hasincreased to such an ex tent, that the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It i3 believed that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected trom its judicial force. The evils arising from delay, are less heavily felt by the courts when it is seen that they involve the discussion of questions of a public char acter. The remedy suggested by the Attorney General, is the appointment of additional circuit judges, and the creation of an in termediate" court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. I commeod this suggestion to the consid eration of Congress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, of not more than sixty thousand dollars a year, which would cer tainly be small in comparison with the objects to be attained. 

POSTOFFXCE DEPARTMENT. The report of the Postmaster General bears testimony to the general, revival ot business throughout tne country. The receipts of the Postoffice Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $30,041,982.86, being $704,465 91 more than the revenues of the preceding year. The amount realized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards, was $704,405.91 more than in the preceding vear, and $2,387,559 23 more than in 1877. The expenditures of the Department were $33,449,899 45, cf which the sum of $376,401.63 was incurred on liabilities incurred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year were 801,209 77 less than in the preceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the operation of the law passed June 17th, 1878, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commission on the value of stamps sold, to a commission on stamps cancelled. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations in addition to the revenues ot the Department was $3,031,454 90, being $2,270,197 80 less than in the preceding year. The expenditures for the fiscal year end ineJune30, 1881, are estimated at $39,. 920.900, and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for, out of the Treasury, of $7,710,900. The relations of the Department with railroad companies have been harmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their compensation, by tbe appropriation tor special facilities, an d the railwav post-office lines have been greatiy extenddd, especially in the Southern States. The interests of the railway-mail service and of the public would be greatly promot ed, f nd the expenditures could be more readily controlled by the classification ot the employes of the railway-mail service ns recommended bv the Postmaster-Gen eral, the appropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be made in gross. The Postmaster-General recommends an amendment of the law regulating the in crease of compensation for increased ser vice and increased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to advertise for proposals tor such increased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the commerce of the country frem the en actment of a general law authorizing con tracts with American-built steamers, carry, ing tbe American flag, for transporting the mail between ports of the United States and ports of the West Indies and South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulated by annual appropriations, . in like manner with the amount paid for the domestic star service. The arrangement made by the Postmaster General and Secretary of the Treasury for the collection of duty opon books received in the mall from toreign countries, has proved so satisfactory in Us practical opera tion that the recommendation is now made, that Congress shall extend the provisions mv oecB ,ven .rr-:wr l Jfrer . it 1( essentially a Femi1j5U-ti,e ard saonlii be kept in every household as a e-S-Va d ca unre.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR INDIAN AFFAIRS. The reports of the Secretary of the Inte rior and of the Commissioner cf Indian Affairs, setting forth the present state of our relations with the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory that the occurrence ot two disturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of property, is all the more to be lamented. The history ot the outbreak on the White River Ute reservation in Western Colorado has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the public press, that its remarkable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as wili prevent further hostile contact between the Indians and the border settlements in Western Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at the Mascalero agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a small band of marauders, after committing many atroci ties, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way across the Mexican border and is now on foreign soii. While these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of Indians were engaged", are most deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian population have fully justified the expectations of those who believe that by humane and peaceful in fluences the Indian can be led to abandon the habits ot savage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupa tions. What they have already - accom plished in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable success which has attended the experiment of em ploying as freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed by them for the education of their children, maybe taken as sufficient proof that thev will be found capable of ac complishing much more if they rcontinue to be wisely and fairly guided. The "In dian policy" sketched in the report of the Secretary of the Interior, the object ot which is to make liberal provision for the education of lodian youth, to settle the Indians uoon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their farms, inalien able for a certain dumber of years, and when their wants are thus provided for, to dispose by sale ot the lands on their reservation not occupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the government of the expenses now provided for by annual ap propriations, must commend itself as just and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove those obstructions which the existence of large reservations presents to the settlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly rec ommend the enactment of a law enabling the government to give Indians a title fee, Inalienable tor twenty-flve years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allottment. I alsr repeat the recommendation made in my first annual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of bavin g, by their own labors, and who are willing to detach themselves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them patents containing the same provision of inalienability for a certain period. THE 

TEACE AND EDUCATION TOLICY. The experiment of sending a number of Indian children, ot both sexes, to the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Insti tute, in Virginia, to receive an elementary English education and practical instruction in farming and other useful industries, has led to results so promising, that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the Interior Department lor the establish ment of an Indian school on a largrer scale. This school has now 153 pupiis, select ed from various tribes, and is in lull operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of a number of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the Pacific elope, in a similar manner, at Forrest Grove, in Oregon. These insti tutions will commend themselves to the liberality of Congress, and to the philan thropic munificence of the American peo- Ple- j , Last spring, information was received of the organization of an extensive movement in tbe Western States, the object of which was theoccupation by unauthorized persons of certain lsnda in the Indian Territory ceded by the Cherokees to the Government for the purpose of settlement by other Indian tribes. On the 29th of April, I issued a procla mation warning all persons against parti cipation in such an attempt, and, by the co-operation of a military force, the inva sion was promptly checked, it is my pur pose to protect the rights of the Indian in habitants of that Territory to the full extent ot the Executive power. But it would be unwise to ignore the fact that a Territory so large and'so fertile, with a population so sparse and with so ereat a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition oi such attempts as happened this year, when the surrounding States are more densely settled, and the westward movement of our population looks still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupv. Under such circumstances the diffi culty of maintaining the Indian Ter ritory in its present state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare ,or such a contingency. I, therefore, fully ap prove of the advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occa sion, to divide among themselves in severalty a9 large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual title in fee, instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the "balance of their lands may be disposed of by the Government for their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would more certainly secure for them selves the value of their possessions, and at the same time promote their progress in civilization and prosperity, than by en deavoring to perpetuate the present state of things in the Territory. The question whether a change in the control ot the Indian service should be made, was in the Forty fifth Congress re ferred to a joint committee of both Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual message I expressed tbe hope that the de cision of that question, then in prospect, "would arrest further agitation of this sub ject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon tue service as well as the Indians themselves." Since then, the committee having reported, tbe ques tion has been decided In the negative by a vote In the House ot Kepresentatifes. Fore the reason here stated, and in view viewtf the fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstiuct EFFicrsiir. 

SIMPLE. nun a r-r r other much needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and to unset tle salutary measures now in progress for the government and improvement of the Indians, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to stand. THE TIMBER LANDS. The efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the depredations on the timber lands of the United States have been continued, and have met with consid erable success. A large number of cases of trespass have been proseeuted in the courts . of the United States; others have been set tled, the trespassers offering to make pay ment to the government for the value of the timber taken bp them. The proceeds of these prosecutions and settlements turned into the treasury, far exceed in amount the sums appropriated by Congress for this purpose. A more important result, how evea, consists in the fact that the destruc tion of our public forests by depredation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in extent, and it Is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued and sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress, such trespasses, at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in Territories where timber for the daily requirements of the population can not, under the present state of the law, be otherwise obtained. I therefore earnestly invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a law be enacted ena bling the . Government to sell timber from the public lands without conveying the fee, where such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to conform to domestic wants and business requirements, while at the same time guarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. The enactment of such a law appears to become a more pressing necessity every day. DXFABTMKNT OF AORICCI.TTBE. Sly recommendations in former messages are re newed in favor of enlatging the facilities of the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture is the leading interest and the permanent industry of our people. It ts to the abundance of agricultural pro duction, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely increased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look for its con tinued maintenance to the same substantial re source. There is no branch of industry in which labor. Directed by scientific knowledge, yields such increased production in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the pabMc service to which the encouragement ot liberal appropriations can be more appropriately extended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy: bat, on the contrary, undoubtedly results in los-es of immense sum annna ly that might be saved through well di rected efforts by the Government to promote this Vital interest. The resnlts already accoroplifhed with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command cf the Department of Agricnltcra ts au earnest of what might be expectea with increased appropria tions for the several purposes indicated in the re port of the Commicsioner, with a view to placing the Department upon a footii.g which will enable it to prosecute mote efitctively the objects for which it is established. Appropriations are needed for a mere complete laboratory, iorthe establiment of a vefrinary di vision, and n division of forettry, &Ld for an in crease of forre. The requirements of thee and other purposes, indicated in the report of the Commissioner under the head of the immediate necessities of the De partment, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country cannot with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture. crane op x-dccatiow. It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Edu cation the extent to which educational privileges throughout the United fetatcs fcave been advanced during the year. No more fundamental responsi bility reus upon Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to education, supnlemental to local action in the States and Ter ritories, and in the District of Co'nmbla. The wise forethought of the founders of our Government has rot only famished the bais for the 6uoprtof the common fchool systems of the newer States, but Hid the foundations for the maintenance of their universities aiid colleges of agriculture and tbe mechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this traditional poiiry for the further benefit of all these interests, and the extension cf the same advantages to every portion of the country it is hoped, will re ceive our favorable consideration.
