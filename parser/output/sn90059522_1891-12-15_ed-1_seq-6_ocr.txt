Secretary Evans' Report Indi cates a Healthy Progress in All Respects. Indiana Miners Maintaining 1 a Firm Front in Face of Discouragement. Birmingham. Ala.. Dec 14. — The eleventh annual meeting of the Amer ican Federation of Labor convened in Ibis city at 10 o'clock this morning, be ing called to order by President Samuel Gompers. Gov. Thomas (J. Jones deliv ered an address of welcome on behalf of Birmingham, and Samuel 11. Free man on behalf of the local labors. About one hundred and fifty delegates from all parts of the United Stales and Canada are in attendance, and the meet ing will last at l.uist a week. President (.Jumpers, in calling the con vention to order, said he would reserve the delivery of his annual address until tomorrow, and proceeded to deliver a brief address of welcome. It was. he said, the largest convention of the fed eration in its history. The growth of the organization during the oast year had " been phenomenal, and the delegates before him represented more than three-quarters of a million of organized laborers. Much, however, as had been accomplished in the past, much more still remained to be done in the future. He pave a hearty welcome to the delegates, and urged them to re turn to their different organizations de termined to push Onward and Upward forthe future. Continuing, he said: "It should be our efforts to make each succeed in convention of the American Federation of Labor an improvement on the preceding one, both in num bers and intelligence, keeping pace with the ever increasing intel ligence and pressing demands of the masses and the development of the in dustries of our country. On every hand we rind organization and combination on the part of those who own or control the wealth, and usinsi their possessions to crush out the liberties!, to stifle the ynice. to prevent the rights, of the toil ing masses. ■•While it is true that many attempts Lave been made to grapple "with this condition of affairs, 7 puny and futile have been the results. These com binations can only be successful) coped with by a compact and thorough organization of the «vajre workers of our country. The more thorough our or ganization, the more complete our representative capacity in the conventions of the American Feder ation of Labor, the more we will dem onstrate to the world our fitness to grapple with this nineteenth century phenomena. The whole cause of hu manity appeals to us to be true to the miss on of our class, and help in the nevci -ending contests for Reform, Justice ami Iti^ht. "The perpetuity of the institutions of c r com try and the freedom of the citizens and the man. the burdens upon tie ■ shoulders of our sisters, the c:;. of the young and innocent children for ' relief, demand us to labor all in our power, to exert every effort we «re capable, to bring about a condition of affairs more rational and human, and relieve us from the stigma of carlessness, and indifference of these great wrongs by which we are sur rounded.* 1 At the conclusion of the president's address the convention went into ex ecutive session and the doors were closed. The usual committees were ap pointed. General Secretary Chris Evans then presented his annual financial report, In doing so. lie -aid: "The work of the past year has developed many thoughts that will serve educate and help to formu late legislation for the wage-earners. That mistakes have been made no one v.ill question, but in the discussions that •will :irise during the proceedings of our meeting, let our motto be legis lation for the relief of the masses as against the selfish greed of the few; lei the knowledge we have gained by experience act as a guide for us in the future to avoid as much as possible a repetition of the errors of the past. "The trades union movement is doing a noble work in the line of reform. We are not making as rapid progress as we should. We arts . lir<!it<-iii:i the ?lisery and degradation of the wage-earning class, however [the statement to the contrary notwithstanding). Let us move upward; press our claim foi justice to the wealth producers, and follow the path marked out by the trades unions affiliated by the American Federation of Labor, and success is turn" The report proceeded to state that during the term ending Oct. :Jl, lS'.il, 240 charters had been issued to unions in thirty states r.s follows: Ar kansas, Connecticut, 2; Colorado. 4: District of Columbia. 2: Georgia, "i: 11 li nois,"18; Indiana. 22; Kansas. j; Ken tucky, 2; Louisana. 3: Massachusetts. 8; Michigan. 2:2: Missouri. <>; Minnesota, 4; Mississippi^ T: Maine, 2; Montana, 1: !New York, IS; New Jersey, 3; \ew Mexico. 3: Ohio, 5; Pcuasyluania, 16: Khode Island. 1; Tennessee. 4: Texas. 1: Virginia, 2; Wisconsin. 8; Washing ton, 5; West Virginia; 3.

INDIANA STRIKE. In the face of Discouragemen the Miners Are Firm. Brazil, Imi.. Dec. 14.— The situatioi In the bituminous coal regions of In diana, in which some 20,000 miners an on strike, is a gloomy one for the strik ers, and its outcome may bring the wol to the dcor of many a delver in tin bowels of the earth in adjacent states The Indiana strike is one ot desperatioi according to the stories told by themei ■" p 3 at '" tjjS "~^k B I — . f ati<o Baking Used in Millions of Hoinen —40 $ears the Standard and certainly the outlook is one of pinching nuneer. if not actual starva tion, cold and nakedness. The mine operators say that the pres ent strike is in violation" of an agree ment made by the men last spring not to ask for an advance m waires for one year, and that, in view of that fact, they will not negotiate with the strikers. The latter say that the mine owners took advantage of them last spring, when they were not prepared for a strike, to force them into si^nine an un just scale, and that refusing to keep that contract any looser than necessary they are no Blare blameful than they would ue to turn upon a highway rob ber whenever opportunity ottered. They declare that the "miners of In diana have been more oppressed and ground down than those ot any other state in the Union; that their wagM have been less: that they have been subjected to all sorts of oppression; that their condition was little better than that of Russian convicts in Siberian mines: and that they >truck for more decent treatment in sheer desperation, preferring starvation to further snbmis sion, though their comuiitteemeii are tryitie to hide the fact, it is nevertheless true, that many of the men and their families are already on the rente of starvation, subsisting on one meal a day, and have been doing so for two weeks. .The relief received thus far has been very scant and. in some places the strikers are totally without fuel, the mine owners having undertaken to freeze them out by refusing even to sell j them coal. In the face of all this, how j ever, the men talk with an air of grim j determination to liirht it out to the ' death, if need be. There is hope, how- I ever, that tins will not become neces sary, as the national executive board jot the coal miners' association of ! the United States has at last recognized I the strike and approved it and has issued a cail to allow its members to contribute to the relief of the strikers. This broadens the scope of the fight. It lias been stated that mine owners in adjoining states have been supplying contracts for the Indiana mine owners. This will be investigated by the board, and if it cannot be checked in any other j way, the miners in those states will be : called out also. _ !

TALKING FOR MERUIAM. Northwestern Republicans Enthu siastic in His Cause Chicago, — Prominent Repub lican politicians of Minnesota, who have passed through Chicago within the last few days declare that the Northwest intends to make a strong bid for the second place on the Republican na tional ticket. The man upon whom they are practically united is Gov. W. R. Merriam, of Minnesota.' It is claimed in his behalf that he is very popular in Minneapolis, the convention etty, as well as through out the state, and that the local feeling cannot fail to make itself felt in the de liberations of the convention. This is aside from his actual qualifications for the vice presidency, which are set out at length and with a good deal of enthu siasm. (Joy. Jlerriani is a man of consider , able wealth and will be backed in the i , convention by such men as Thomas ; ■ Lowry, Col. C. H. Graves, Mayor Nut phin. of Dulutli; Col. Mullen, ofWa ', basha, and many other leading Repub- ! i | Means. He will also, without doubt, be ' . j heartily supported by all the local Re- j ! publican papers. His supporters claim j that he can have the votes of Montana and the two Dakota*, besides those of i I Minnesota, to start with, and that his . | vote will increase as the contest goes j on. • p ' <> Defending the Dead.

" ; It is apparent from the above list that ■ the senators from the Northwestern i states have been well taken care of in j the matter of chairmanships and places on important committees. While Messrs. Felton.Dubois and Ilansbrough do not secure chairmanships, they do get assignments to committees * that originate a large part of the important legislation of congress. The name ot Senator Kyle does not appear upon Che list, although .Senator \ Peffer, his Alliance colleague, is given four committee assignments. It is learned that Senator Kyle was ap- j proached with a view to ascertaining his preferences, but that his response ' was non-committal, and vaguely hinted at an expectation that the Alliance sen ators would receive committee assign ments from both the Republican and Democratic caucuses. Doubt has also been cast upon his soundness in Repub lican principles, so that up to this time the Republican caucus has been unable to place him, although it may do so to morrow. As nearly as can be gathered rom the expressions of many senators, the as signments made by the committee are generally satisfactory. It was found impracticable to meet all the expecta tions of the new senators, but the dis satisfaction that exists is believed to be confined to less than half a dozen sena tors. Messrs. Sacadera and Powers, of Montana, wished to be assigned to (He committees on appropriations and finance, but the committee was unable to comply with their requests in this re spect. 

BUSHELS OF BILLS. Ovor 800 Presented in the Senate in Two Days. Washington.

Proposed increased pen sion legislation received several acces sions, including a bill pensioning all soldiers who fousht in Indian wars. Two additional bills were added to the already long list of Chinese restriction measures. A bill ror the better protec tiou of the public service, requiring the heads of departments to dismiss all for eien-born employes not naturalized, was introduced by Senator tlallinger. The senate, in secret session, referred a number of recess appointments re ceived this morning from the president to the appropriate committees, and at the request of Senator Allen, of Wash ington, cuntinued the nomination of Andrew W asson as collector of customs at Pucet .Sound. Without transacting further business the senate adjourned atl:2oontil to-morrow. Senator MeMilUn introduced a bill amending the convict labor act so as to prohibit contractors from employing convict labor on pwamneni buildings. Senator Stanford introduced a bill amending: the Chinese exclusion act so as to require Chinese removed from the I'nited States to be sent to China in stead of the country from whence they came. It is provided further that the burden of proof sU»ll be on any Chinese laborer or person who shall claim the rieht to remain in the United States to establish such right. 

CL.IRKSON NEUTRAL. Thelocva Statesman Has Xo Presi dential Preferences. CnirA<;o, Dec 14.— .lames S. Clark son, chairman of the Republican na tional committee, this morning demol ished the story telegraphed from Wash ington recently to the effect that Mr. Clarkson had declared himself for Pres ident Harrison for renomiuation. "It is not true.'" said Mr. Clarkson, "1 have not declared myself for either Mr. Hlaine or Mr. Harrison. 1 have no pref erence and I do not know anything about the intentions of either. "I saw Mr. Blame several days ago and he looked as well as he did when he re turned from the Indian territory.. I have not the least doubt but that the re lations between Mr. Harrison qnd Mr. Blame are cordial and as friendly as they always have been.' "Will Mr. Blame's position be defined very soon." "I have not heard anything about it." Mr. Clarkson leaves for Minneapolis to nicbt, to look over the ground there for holding the convention. BRYAN'S BILLS.

Representative Br^yan, of Nebras ka, will propose a constitutional amend ment that will, if adopted, permit any state to elect its United States senators by the vote of the people. Another measure he has in view is in tended to correct an evil that he says prevails to a gnat extent in the Northwest. He proposes to compel the sale ot all property under United States court processes in the county where the property is sold, and causing: the advertising of the same to be likewise made in the county. It frequently hap pens, says Mr. Bryan, that property is advertised and sold many hundred miles distant from where it is located. Another measure he proposes to push to passage, it he can. i> one providing that when a certain amount has been realized the inventor of a patented arti cle shall cease to be protected.
