In the almost universally favorable comment excited by the president's ad mirable message, a paragraph pretty generally touched upon is the exposition of the fallacy that high tariff makes high wages. President Cleveland puts the point very plainly in his illus trations of the workman, who, receiving excellent wages under the operation of the high tariff, is obliged to spend the product of several days' toil in paying the increased price brought about by the tariff upon an article absolutely re quired in his family, and to whose man ufacture his own work may have con tributed. Wages are high or low relatively. If one man earns -510, and is able to buy as much with it in a full market as the man who earns sin can in a protected market, obviously the wages, no matter what they are intrinsically, are actually the same. It is the purchasing power alone that determines the value of money, and, consequently, of wages. The money itself is simply a con venient medium: the goods bought with it represent the real reward of labor. Therefore if under a reduced tariff a workman is enabled to procure more of the necessaries and even luxuries of life than under a high tariff, the change is obviously to hi- advantage, even though his monetary wage- are reduced— a sup position entertained for the sake of argument. The plea of the ultra-protectionists is a very specious one and is urged with all possible force upon the workmen who are not inclined to look beyond the amount received in actual money for the remuneration of their labor; but with the intelligent and clear-headed workers of the West, with the men who are interested in tracing the rela tionship between cause and effect, with these it won't go down. — ■ AN 

EXCELLENT IDEA. There has been formed recently in Washington a woman's club with an ex cellent object in view— the reading of newspapers. It is a lamentable fact that the average woman is not a news paper reader. If she knows anything about current news it is learned by hear say and in a superficial way. At best she gets bin a smattering of matters with which she should be well ac quainted. She should be as well in formed as to what is contained in the foreign news department as she is with that contained in the department of j births, deaths and marriages. But gen- • erally she isn't. Now this is all wrong. J There is no reason why a woman j shouldn't be as conversant with the ; news of the day as her brother or hus- : band. That is the way a certain number of ! women in Washington have reasoned, and the result is the formation of a so ciety which meet- several times weekly at the houses of the members. Leading ! newspapers are then read, the articles ! discussed and criticised until every per son present is thoroughly familiar with them and has a tolerably good knowl edge of the subject. The idea has be- ! come very popular at the capital, and i other clubs, having the same object, are ! forming. Whoever originated the ; scheme deserves credit, for seldom has there been a form of social amusement devised which carries with it so much substantial benefit." Newspaper-reading clubs should be j popular elsewhere than in Washington. and their extension throughout the j country would soon have a perceptible ' effect in raising the standard of average , feminine Intelligence, at least so far as the day's happenings are concerned. -*-*-» 

SHREWD INVESTORS. Messrs. Grew and Wn.soN,of Paris, j France, two gentlemen who have been occupying more than a fair share of j public attention lately, are pretty j shrewd fellows after all. No one can realize the instability of French gov ernment so well as those who are actu ally engaged in governing. and ex-Presi dent Gbevy and his son-in-law have given practical evidence of that fact. Enjoying unusual facilities for coin- ! ing money through government aid.M. Wilson has grown my rich. His re- I , spected father-in-law has far preceded j him on the road to wealth. But each ; one knew that in excitable France a! revolution or a panic might occur at I amy time to sweep away their great for- j tunes. They looked around them, lis- I tened to the seductive voice of the i American investment broker and found ' his conversation pleasing. As a result ; the two distinguished Frenchmen have ! invested something like a million each in the United States, where government is stable and incomes arc sure. Their example is one which other wealthy foreigners might follow with profit. In no country in Europe are re turns from investments as large or as sure as they are in Anicriea.particulariy in that portion of it known as the great West; and an enlightened self-interest ought to make other foreign capitalists aware of that fact. it-** INGALLS' SCHEME. Senator IxftAi.i.s has a little scheme for reducing the surplus, lt contem plates the establishment of a great na tional school for the training of teach ers, who are to be paid regular salaries by the government and who, on gradua tion, are to be sent out to the different parts of the country where ignorance most prevail- to do battle for the cause of knowledge. The idea is at first glance a fascinat ing one. It would certainly result in very materially reducing the surplus if that were the only thing to be desired, but it would hardly accomplish the edu cational purposes which the Kansas ! senator seeks to achieve. The public school system of the country is already j as nearly perfect as it can be under the circumstances, and it would leave but a limited field of operation for Senator Ixgai.ls' government teachers. Ignorance is, as a rule, more prev alent in the densely crowded cities j than in the country, and the public ; schools of the cities afford educational j opportunities to all willing to avail ; themselves of them. In towns, villages j and the less thickly populated school j districts the graduates of Normal schools j are doing a good work, and admirably j supplement the efforts of the teachers I employed in the ordinary way. So that [ unless they should be sent to the front ier the government instructors would not have a very extended scope. Bui a -department containing several thousand able-bodied men who could be sent to any pact of the country at short notice would have great political possi bilities, and perhaps Senator Ixo alls is not entirely oblivions to that fact. A BLAINE ORGAN. It is a curious story, which is now hedged around with enough circum stantial evidence to give it credence, ! that involves the purchase of the Chi cago Times by a syndicate of Republic- ' ans, who will manage it in the interest of Mr. Blame's candidacy for the j presidency. That the distinguished i gentleman from Maine is in sore need of a defender in Chicago is especially evident since the defection of the Trib une, hitherto a thick and thin sup porter of Mr. Bi.aixk. But that tlie rimes -lion ld have been secured for such service will seem odd, indeed, to those old-timers who have been ac quainted with its sturdy Democracy for more years than they would care to count. Evidently buffeted by fortune and the law courts, the magnificent property which Storey spent a life time in creating is Hearing the end of its usefulness. The journal whose one end and aim is the advancement of the personal in terests of one man can never fulfill its destiny as a newspaper. It becomes an organ pure and simple, by which noth ing is presented that does not aid in the one object for which it exists. If the | ghost of Storey does not haunt the cdi- j torial rooms of the Times the first night I it passes into the control of the Blame crowd, it will only be because the vet- j eran editor is hampered in "that un- j known bourne from which no traveler returns" by bonds which even an ec stacy of frenzy cannot break. But even though he should purchase an organ in every city in the country, we are much inclined to the belief that Mr. Blaise's long purse will avail him nothing. _' mm The Hon. Joe Chamberlain is not accom plishing much in this country, but he is- set ting a good many dinners given him, which will enable him to arrange his expense ac count in a very satisfactory way indeed.

THE SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER- 11, 1887.— TWENTY PAGES. I MEN WHO TALK. F. J. Hilton. - F. J. Hilton. Keal Estate Dealer— Probably the biggest real estate boom now in the West is that of San Diego. Cal.. and an idea of its vastuess may be inferred from the fact that the transfers of real estate during the past two weeks aggregated $33.(100,000. Seats have been engaged in passenger and chair ears three weeks in advance by those who wish to visit this portion of the Pacific coast with a view to investing money, and 1 found that -out to-day. A syndi cate of capitalists from the East, among them being Messrs. John Cushman, of New York: Philip Potts, of Cincin nati; Richard Ci i.vkk, of. Covington. Ky.. and Horace Crack, of Indian apolis, telegraphed me to obtain seats on a train for them that would leave St. Paul Monday. This was an impossibility, and I was compelled to charter an entire car for their accommodation. They are going to San Diego to investigate the boom personally. For the information of those who want to visit San Diego, I j want to say that a bare room costs (50 a month, and even at that figure it is diffi cult to obtain lodgings. Within the | next year it is estimated that the popu- ; lation of San Diego will be increased | 50,000, and people are pouring in now at * the rate of 1,200 a day, many of whom] have signified their intention of taking i up a permanent residence. Actual im provements valued at $7,000,000 are now. I under way, and the Atchison, Topeka& • Santa Feliailroad company is helping immigration by every means possible. . Capt. Kit Bean. Edward S. Bean*, Captain Company D. Second Regiment, Minnesota Na tional Guard— My command is putting in the winter preparatory to giving a \ series of exhibition drills in the princi- I pal Eastern cities next summer, and will also enter the competition drill at Indianapolis. Owing to the distance. j we will not go into the proposed compe tition at Austin, Tex., but confine our efforts to more accessible points. Every Tuesday night we have squad ; drill." and Thursday evenings art de voted to the company maneuvers, in which thirty-two men participate. When we go on our trip it is likely that ! we will take forty-three men. all told, j with us, and the boys have shown the I greatest enthusiasm and alacrity in the task that I have set for them. That Wisconsin company which was awarded the first prize at the Chicago drill did not accept our challenge, but in one of their home papers declared that they could not compete with a second honor j company like ours. That was a fine bluff for them to make, especially as they were victorious over the Toledo cadets, an organization that was ninth at 'Washington last May. F. X Welz. Col. F. R. Welz, Merchants Hotel— Despite the fact that the legislature will . not meet here this winter, 1 never knew business to be better, and in conversa tion with the leading wholesale men of J St. Paul my statement is fully substan tiated. A comparison of the business j done by mv house with last season, be- j ginning with fall, shows that receipts | have been larger and guests more numerous than ever before to the his tory of the Merchants. And it is a good I class of customers, too, that has patron- | ized us, and the other hotels report the same gratifying results. While we naturally regret that the Republican convention will not be held at Minne apolis next year, our carnival season j will make amends for any deficiency in that respect. Already a number of the best rooms in my house have been en (raced for the carnival, and principally ! by persons living in the East, some of them as far north as Connecticut. We anticipate a big rush from the 15th of j January until the ice palace is a thing , of the past. P. M. Cleary. Col. P. M. Cleary, ot Chicago— Just ! as sure as fate the Democratic conven- j tion will meet at Chicago, too, thus fol lowing the good example set by the Re- j publicans In ISB4. There is no finer hall in the world than that in the exposition building on the lake front, with a capac ity for 10,000 spectators. It is useless to j talk of going elsewhere with the conven- I tion, for Chicago can take care of the biggest crowds and do it in a regal man ner as well. No one who ever visited j the Garden City on one of these conven- j tion occasions had any fault to find with the hotel accommodations or the man- j ncr in which delegates were entertained, so that it was no wonder tome that only | three ballots were necessary to decide the question of location at the recent meeting of the Republican committee at | Washington. There is time enough yet for the cities of the Northwest to secure this prize.but they must wait a few years, until they are more fully developed. I do not say this with any desire to crow ] about Chicago, but am simply stating facts that can readily be verified. J. H. Haverly. J. 11. Haverlv, Manager and Lessee of the Proposed New Opera House — Everything is moving along in the smoothest possible manner for our new enterprise, and 1 have returned to St. Paul for the purpose of having a con- j ference with J. 15. McMirran on the subject. We have had no difficulty in raising the funds to insure the com pletion of our new edifice, which will be used not only for theatrical purposes, but for business as well, and will cost j $2j0,000. Ground will be broken for the building as soon as spring opens, and it is our expectation that it will be com- i pleted in time fcr the inauguration of ! the season of 1888 and 'Sit. '1 he site se- j lected, corner of Sixth and Cedar streets. will give an upward tendency to real estate in that vicinity, and I do not j think that any one who invests in the stock of the new theater will have cause to regret it. My connection with the enterprise will be as lessee of the ! theater only, and 1 will not have any j interest in the business block save as a | Stockholder, and have already put up j my money for that purpose. L. N. Scott. L. N. Scott. Manager Grand Opera j House— Some idea of the magnitude of the work of bill posting in St. Paul ! may be imagined when the readers of | tbe Globe learn that exclusive of dead j walls of buildings and fences there are I 100,000 square feet embraced to the bill ] boards of this city. Melodramas rely largely upon this method of advertis ing, because a class of people are at- j tracted to the display made on the bill boards who never think of looking in a | newspaper for theatrical attractions. Bui with society plays it is different, \ and stars like .Mrs. Langtry. Fanny : Davenport and Rhea dein-nd upon the press for keeping them before the j people and telling what they have to offer as features. In the domain of the j spectacular, too, the bill" boards play a i prominent role, and millionaires and ! laborers can be seen, side by side, study ing the glories depicted in the immense , papers on the wooden walls. The | lamest sheets used cover a space of , 1.050 square feet, and the scale is a de scending one to 100 square feet, while I the signs range from a half sheet to j forty sheets. Although an effort was made recently in the East to do away with lithographs in the show windows of business bouses, there has been no opposition to the practice in this city, and the latest intelligence from Boston, , New fork and Chicago is that the litho graph is more firmly entrenched than ever. -•*•*■ Mr Nelson's Views. St. loud Time-. Congressman Nelson of the Fifth dis- ! trict,' says he thinks the president's message "was well put anil right to the ; point, and it dealt on the most promi- I newt and important and popular ques tions of the day.'* He also said that lie would go as -far as it is possible to go in reducing taxation.

WHISPERS. Col*. C. A. Broadwater, of Montana" is a gentleman who has been identified with the West for more years than he would care to say, and who is well known In St. Paul. Though he has, worked hard all these years "that he has been aiding in developing the resources ** of Montana, the energetic colonel has not acquired more than a moderate por-, tion of this world's goods until compar atively recently. lie is now easily a millionaire. How did this satisfactory*! change come about? Easy enough when '■ you know the details, i'ou must know that Col. Broadwater and President, Hill, of the Manitoba, are firm friends « of many years' standing. Well, when a , few years ago the Northern Pacific rail road come into Helena it found it desir sirable to possess some property which Mr. Broadwater owned, or at least a. portion of it. Negotiations proceeded,'; aad : Mr. Broadwater had to^ face ' the disagreeable . possibility of letting his land go for a song or of 1 getting nothing at all for it; and more-*; over of seeing the railroad pass it by at a distance which would render it prac tically valueless. Mr. Hill became ac quainted with his predicament and told, him to let the Northern Pacific "go to thunder," or words to that effect, and intimated that he should lose nothing by it. Col. Broadwater had confi dence in his friend and did as he was told. The negotiations stopped and the Northern Pacific passed him by. This summer the Manitoba entered 'Helena. It crossed Broadwater's land, part or which it purchased. The rest immedi ately boomed sky high and was sold, but at a big enough figure to enable In!. Broadwater to round out his even million. Not only that, but he has been made president of the Montana Central, with opportunities for further money making and for worrying his sworn enemy. ex-Gov. 

MAUSER. But chances like tliat don't come very, often. Apropos of the Manitoba and Helena I listened to a prominent jobber, tiie other day, who grew red in the face with the energy required to express his dis gust at what he called the simple-mind edness of the Helena people in holding such a jollification over the arrival of the Manitoba at Helena. "Those peo ple don't know it yet," he said, "but some day, and pretty soon, too, they will find out that Jim Hill is not going to carry them on his back. He is not running a railroad for fun or for char ity, but to make money, and they will discover that he won't give ' them any cheaper rates than they had before. Not only that, but though they can't see it, the road is not going to do them any especial good. It is simply one more, feeder, lt won't do anything to develop the town, because it cannot add anything more to the vol ume of the town's business. It will do far more good to St. Paul, in the new country tributary to us that it opens up, than it will to Helena. But the Mon tanians don't know that. When they do find out that Hill intends to make out of them all he can, instead of help ing them out of any fancied bondage, there will be a howl that will be heard clear to St. Paul." I don't know whether this irate gen tlema nvv as a holder of Northern Pacific* preferred or not. Perhaps you noticed recently in the papers a statement to the effect that the! Chicago Tribune. which has always been] a thick and thin supporter of Blame. has recently turned against him, and now declares that it finds itself unable. to support him. A whisper is wafted-: from Chicago to the effect that there is: something more than principle and politics in this change of front. It is even asserted that the vagaries of that mischievous little fellow whom we call Cupid is at the bottom of it all. The story is that a love affair culminating in an engagement existed for some time between Emmons ' Blame, a son of James C, and Miss Me^ill; daughter of the veteran editor. Everything ran smoothly for a while, until the course of. true love was roughened by a personal disagreement between voting Blaink and Mr. Medill, who in the length to which his anger went declared that young Blame, who is about the best of the family, should not have his daughter. Mr. " Blame senior natu rally took his son's part, and the edi tor's anger turned against the distin guished sire. Sir. Medill never does things by half, and capped the climax by ordering his paper to oppose Mr. Blame as soon as opportunity oc curred, which was on the occasion of his recent interview* regarding the pres ident's message. And Mr. Medill's opposition is not a thing of small mo ment. "1 know not what the truth may be; I tell the tale as 'twas told to me." Haven't you often noticed what a thin veneer of refinement, polish and culture there frequently is upon those interest ing persons, the new rich, around whom the odor of greenbacks seems to cling like the scent of the rose around the broken vase of which the poet sings? Well, that reminds the Whis perer of a recent occurrence. There is a woman living in a city not 1,000 miles from St. Paul whose" acquisition of wealth has been so recent that she has not yet had time to adapt herself to the customs and vocabulary of the circle into which her money lias now brought her. She is very ambitious socially and entertains a great deal, and sue is especially desirous of having anything novel at her entertainments. Recently she heard a gentleman speak of a party which he had attended at an Eastern country house, and he incidentally men tioned that ice cream was served in a rotunda. That caught the fancy of Mrs. Xewrich at once. She was about to give a small party. So the next day she hastened down town to the nearest glassware dealer's and told him she wanted three dozen rotundas sent up at once. Not daring to correct her, though he recognized the fact that he had a Mr-. Ma i. a PROP to deal with, the store keeper sent her to another shop, saying he was just out of rotundas. She met with a similar experience at the second and third shops. Finally, beginning to suspect that something was wrong, she dropped in a book store to consult a dic tionary, and the blush of shame that suffused her face on discovering that a rotunda was not something out of which to eat ices has not yet died out of her face. ,"_ ' c- There is a good deal of truth inthe' saying that it takes a liberal education to know how to be rich. Do you know P. N. Groat, of the Northern Pacific? If you don't you should make his acquaintance, for he is one of the pleasantest and most thor- ' ough gentlemen you would meet in a day's journey anywhere. If you know him well enough you may address him as "Bill," without fear of offense, and all because of a little incident that hap-' pened in London last summer. Mr. Groat had charge of the Northern' Pacific's exhibit at the American exhibition. His station was directly, next to Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, ami of course Mr. Groat and Mr. Cody became great friends. One day they were standing together near the entrance of the show when a gold-laced and epauletted aide-de-camp approached them. and calling Mr. Groat aside said: "The Hon. Bifkalo Bill, 1 believe—*' then without waiting for an answer— "His Royal Highness and the Princess have just came in and would like to have you come to their box, but can't you first get rid of that beastly, outlandish friend of yours?" Imagine the A. 1). <"s astonishment when hi' was presented to the ••out landish friend," the true I'ikiai." Bill. and fancy the elegant Mr. Groat being mistaken for the rather uncouth, wild Westerner. But having paid something like 1,000, --000 to get acquainted with Buffalo Hill. the English know him better by this time. ' The Win-pi r:r. — Why His Whisker* Quit GaMwinf . St. Louis Dispatch.

Lilian Olcott will make her first appearance in St. Paul to-morrow night at the Grand opera house, where she has a -week's engagement in her cele brated production of "Theodora." Al though Miss Olcott has been before the public as a dramatic star less than three years, she has achieved a reputa tion which ranks her among the first of her profession. •* * . "Theodora" was originally written by M. SAitnot; for Mine. Bernhardt, and li reproduction by her is still regarded by 'the admirers of that eminent artist as one of her most artistic achievements. Miss Olcott had studied the part un "dCr*"?3AßDotj's immediate instruction, and had played it before she ever saw . Bernhardt in the part, and still plays "if as by her originally conceived and ;Ctolj**»rated. It was M. SARDOU'swish to have "Theodora" presented on the "Aniqrican sta***e with all the accompany ing magnificence of scenery and cos • turning with which it was produced in Paris, and Miss Olcott, being in the possession of a handsome fortune, undertook, on her own account, to coin " ply: with the author's wishes, She gives -'tlmjjlay with, perhaps, the most costly stag*** setting and paraphernalia of any play-that has ever been produced in this country. - ..*■*"- - . .-' -.-."■ - . •* * -* - ."-/--- -.- ~ V The Theodora of history gave ample scope to a dramatist with the genius of Sardou." Born and bred in a circus, Theodora afterwards graced a throne. The first scene in Sardou's play pre sents her surrounded by splendor in the palace. Among the court favorites is Antonina, the wife of Belisarius, and who was also a companion of Theodora in the hippodrome. Antonina confesses to Theodora that she has won her hus . band by means of a love philter. Theo dora determines to win the love of her husband, Justinian, by the same means, and resorts to an old sor ceress called Tamia to procure the drug. The sorceress rec ognizes her as the juggler of the circus. At this period Byzantium is divided into two factions known as the Blues and the Greens.

( Miss Olcott is one of the few women on the stage who don't have to depend on her profession for a living. She is the daughter of Brooklyn's most emi nent physician, and owns in her own name property which yields her an in come of -520,000 a year. At sixteen years of age Miss Olcott had acquired some reputation in literary circles a the author of short poems and prose i sketches, which were published in the leading New York journals. While still in her teens she made up her mind to enter the dramatic profession, j and applied herself to a study of stage art. tier debut was made in New York and her success so decided that, with the exception of one short tour, the three years of her professional life have been spent in the metropolis, where she has played successive engagements in the leading theaters of that city. Her brilliant production of "Theodora" at Niblo's was the sensation of the New Yoik theatrical season last year. * * ■»«■ Jo Murphy is said to be making more dear money than any of the traveling j stars. He keeps his expenses down to low water mark all the time, and plays to big houses. Mr. Murphy is pretty j well fixed in the way of an accumula- ; tion of this world's goods. His fortune , is now rated at a round ?1,000,000, and I ;he has investments which it is thought j Jin tfen years' time will increase his " ownings ten fold. * * *# : Mr. Murphy has two good ideas of theatrical management worthy of men tion, In the first place, he thinks that , prices of admission ought to be i educed by all the theaters. He thinks that a dollar is enough to pay for the best seat in the best house to see the best show on earth. In the second place, he has j dispensed with the services of a press ! " agent. He is of opinion that a good i : show doesn't need booming and a bad j ■ I one doesn't deserve it; consequently he | > doesn't see the necessity of hiring a I ; ; man to buzz the newspaper offices just | to make life burthensome to the in mates. Mr. Murphy fully appreciates | the value of newspaper advertising, but thinks that the advertising column is the place to do it. *»* "A kicker from away back" wants to know why the opera house management doesn't furnish pro grammes free for the balcony and gal i lerv, and not allow the usher boys to be ! harrying around through the audience , trying to sell the programmes at tluee cents apiece. Another kicker from not ' so far back wants to know why the pro i gramme is filled up with advertisements J and contains so little information about ■ the performance. He thinks that there should be ii synopsis of each play, or an i argument of each opera on the pro : gramme, and that the selections played I by the orchestra at each performance J should be printed also, lt is done in j the theaters in Eastern cities, and he ' thinks st. Paul audiences are entitled . to equal consideration. » * m Miss (i i fori wears a dress in "Theo- I dora" in the coronation sceue with a I Lai., t . -o.iy-i. ut yard** lone. While playing in a Wisconsin town on her way from Chicago to Minneapolis, the stage was not large enough to get all of the dress on it at one time. When Miss Olcott sat on the throne on the stage the end of the dress train was still in the dressing room. * » Josef Hofmann, the ten-year-old boy pianist, created a great sensation at the Metropolitan opera house in Xew York last Tuesday night. Anton Ru binstein says that Wre child is really the marvel of the age, and all the musical -critics of Germany, France and England unite in referring to him as "the modern Mozav.t." The boy is not only a skilled performer, but is a brill iant composer as well. He is a modest little fellow, and has most perfect child ways on the stage. When he bows his thanks lie usually, when seated at the piano, bobs his head to the keyboard as if the enthusiasm had risen from the ivory. When he has finished and the applause bursts forth he stands up like a little man and bobs his head to the audience, and then turns around and skips away like a little deer. The lecture field is getting to be a bar ren one. When men of the celebrity of Dr. Parker and Thomas Xast fail to attract big audiences, there isn't much room for the small fry class of public lecturers. Xast can talk better with his pencil than with his tongue, any way. He would also fare better with the public if he could hold his temper. When ho undertook in a neighboring city to avenge himself on a newspaper l>ecause of an adverse criticism by car tooning the editor in public, he gave evidence of the possession of asinine qualities that the public had never caught on to. A CONFIDENTIAL TALK. Let Up On the Duties. It is pretty near time to quit railing at the dude, -That particular animal has been subjected to the sarcasms of the entire world for upwards of five years, and it is about time that the world should give its attention to something more worthy of it. The dude has just as much right to exist on the face of the earth as you and 1 have. Of course he has different ideas about dress, but there is no law to prevent his wearing pants with flowing legs or a collar that looks like a snow fence, if he chooses to. There is no cause for this general warfare against the dude. He is a per fectly harmless creature, a sort of a warty growth on the face of nature that somewhat mars her beauty, but doesn't affect her general health. He lives m a little world of his own and hasn't physi cal or mental strength enough to wield an influence,if by chance he should fall heir to one. His tastes are not sordid ; on the contrary, he is satisfied if he is allowed to wiggle his way through life with nothing to taste of but the head of a 87 cane. Xo injury can come from this, unless it be to the cane. He makes a most excellent door mat for our wives and daughters to wipe their feet on. for after he has been wiped on, he jumps up smilingly, shakes off the dirt and meekly lies down again to be mopped all over. lie's a very handy arrange ment to have around in a climate sub ject to sudden changes, for, when out on the street, he is constantly taking off his hat and waving his bangs to the breeze. In this way he manages to soak up a good many hard colds, a great deal of pneumonia that would otherwise fall to the lot of real people, whose time is precious, and who. as a general thing, have something to live for. The dude is a greatly underestimated creature. Though his intrinsic value never exceeds 10 or 15 cents per head, he is worth a great deal more than that to cologne factories and theater man agers, who use him to decorate the front seats of the parquette with during tragic plays when the actors need some thing to look at to make them feel mean and villainous. They are of great bene fit financially to saloonkeepers who hap pen to do business near the opera bouse, for it is the habit of the dude when the curtain goes down to rise up in his sear, haughtily walk over everybody who sits between him and the aisle and make his way to the saloon to get a drink of some stimulant that will enable him to laugh above his breastbone during the next act. The sensation of dudes' feet pat tering over you between acts is not un pleasant when you get used to it. You hear a faint cackle, a slight rustle, a faint, odor floats by you, and all is over. Don't be harsh en the dude unless you discover him getting up within speak ing distance of the female members of your family.in which case you should be very harsh on him. Such an act war rants a great deal of harshness on your part. In fact, if there was not enough of the dude left to tell which piece of him you had been the harshest with, the people would not be justified in blaming you. Again I say, let up on the dude. He has. his mission in life, just the same as snakes, lizards, rats and Chinamen have. His career begins in a clothing store and ends in an unmarked grave. He wears clothes nobody else would wear, he wears jewelry nobody else would wear,and he wears an air of self importance that nobody else would wear. Besides, as I have hinted above, he comes in might] handy for small pox, typhoid fever, diphtheria and other malignant diseases to feed on. Give him a rest. Mother, Love Your Baby. Baby's dead! Many thousand times a day this news is told in a subdued whisper throughout the land, and yet the world goes rushing on into the teeth of eternity, its smiles turning into laughing dew-drops the tears that well from the broken hearts of grief-stricken mothers. ' -"A Baby's dead! Mother, you know what that means. You understand the mean ing of those words as nobody else under stands them. The grief that shakes your poor heart and the tears that burn your pale cheeks cannot interpret to the world the depth and breadth of the great anguish that was bom in your breast when the light of life faded out of the little blue eyes of your idol. The sunlight has gone out of your life, the clouds have made it dark, the pitiless winds moan and wail about you; the flowers that yesterday bloomed | around your pathway, and smil ing at you as you passed happily on, have faded; tlieir heads hang low, they too are sad. You lift your weary eyes from the silent face of jour darling to look into the future, but there seems to be none for you. Black, black, all is black. No light, no happiness, no com fort. How willingly would you give your right hand, aye, even both hands, if you could kiss those tiny rose-bud lips back to life; if you could raise the seal of death from those baby eyes, if you could see once more the flush of health on those waxen cheeks. How willingly you would lay down your own life if . you could once more see those baby eyes dance with innocent joy, if you could hear once more that baby voice coo the simple language that you only could understand, if you could once more feel the baby fingers press youi face with their tiny tins, if you could once more feel the clinging, innocent kisses of those baby lips. Yesterday all these joys were yours. Yesterday you were building great castles around your baby that towered from earth to heaven. Yesterday you were reveling in a beau tiful dream" of which your baby was the central figure. To-day the castles are ruined and your dream is shattered. To day you are struggling in a world of gloom, a sea of misery, for— baby's dead. Mother, watch carefully over that tongue of yours while baby lives. Many times your patience is sorely tried by the little elf. Many times you are vexed by his mischief. Many times, when weary and worn with the cares of the day, when your head and body are ach ing, baby " seems troublesome, baby seems mean, baby seems almost a nuis sahce. At times like this be careful of your tongue. Be careful of your thoughts, for to-morrow the little hands that were so full of mischief may be helpless in death. That little tongue, that yesterday nearly drove you frantic, may" silenced forever; and then, through your tears and your agony, will come like a flood upon your mind all those hasty words, all those cruel thoughts of the day when baby seemed a nuisance. Mother, you will never know how much you love the baby un til 'tis dead. You will never know how dear are its mischievous hands and its clamorous voice to you until they are quiet in death. Mother, love your baby! love it hard. There are those who say it is a sin to love your child too devotedly. If this Is so, then be a sinner. Be a hardened sinner. Be the worst kind of a sinner on earth, and when it comes to the gen eral summing up . you'll stand just as good a show for winning a prize as will those just-so-far-and-no-further cattle who think it is possible for parents to love their children too much. Chil dren were created to be loved, and the woman who doesn't worship her baby isn't worth the name of mother. Tom Holmes. SUNDAY SILHOUETTES. A correspondent asks the Globe to define the material difference between tariff revision and revenue reform. His question is suggested by interviews with members of congress recently published in the Globe, in which some expressed themselves in favor of tariff reform only and some for revenue reform only. Our correspondent will readily under stand the difference when we say there could be tariff revision without a reduc tion of revenue, and there could be a reduction of revenues with out . a revision of the tariff. The tariff might be so readjusted that by removing the duty from one class of articles to another there would be re vision without reduction. The internal revenue might be abolished, thus mak ing a material reduction in the revenues without touching the tariff at all. So our correspondent can readily see that tariff revision and revenue reform may be two distinct propositions, though they naturally seem to go together in the ex isting condition of affairs. Our London cablegram brings the gratifying -information that President Cleveland's message has been a help to the Gladstone party in England- Lord llartixgtox is organizing the Tory party on a protection basis, and Mr. Cleveland's ringing arguments against protection are making converts i for the Gladstone party. * * The Tories were protectionists in the I beginning. The Tory colonists in this j country upheld the imposition of the j tea tax by the British government. The | Revolutionary war was waged in oppo j sition to the assertion of the Tory doc ; trine of a protective tariff. To-day the I Tory party in England and the Repub | lican party in the United States occupy ' the same relations. Each is the party of aristocracy, the party of monopoly and the party advocating a protective tariff. * * The French are making a pretty good stagger after all in imitating American republicanism. The attempted assassi nation of M. Ferry is. unfortunately, too much in the direct line of American political methods. * * The croakers who were predicting i that there wouldn't be ice enough this ! winter to build an ice palace quit croak ing yesterday. The ice king knows his business, ami when the time comes around for his subjects to build him a palace his majesty will have the ma terial on hand. *. * "This is unhealthy weather." is a re mark that has been frequently heard on i the streets during the long spell of mild i winter that we have had. But the re ports of the health department do not | verify the statement. On the contrary, j I the health of the city has never been I ! better than during the last month. The I I fact is. there is no unhealthy weatherpn j Minnesota. Whether cold or warm, mild or blizzardy, seasonable or unsea ; sonable, the death rate keeps at about the same, which in St. Paul is the lowest of any city on this continent. *• * Now everybody is grumbling about the slots in the cable ljne. In their de sire to give ample room for the expan sion and contraction of the iron which is expected to be caused by the extreme conditions of cold and heat in this cli mate, the cable line builders left so much space that the calk of a horse j shoe be caught in the opening, and thus the shoe is sometimes torn from the horse's foot. In this respect the slot is a nuisance. In another respect it is a benefit. It enables the police to enforce the ordinance against fast driv ing on the street crossings. ■*-***--- Shaky Chances. Belle Plaine Herald. Gov. McGill, it would appear, is not in the best possible odor in his own political party, and it seems as if his chances for a reiiomination were some what shaky. Could the reason of the governor's unpopularity be because he has put his foot down on an extra ses sion of the state legislature? Perhaps. Who knows? If so, the governor is to be, after a manner, congratulated, for in our opinion he deserves the thanks of the people of the state, for boldly de clining to be a party to an extra sessiou. An Unwise Act. Fergus Falls Journal. The Minnesota delegation which went to Washington to secure the national convention did such an exceedingly un wise thing as to all wear fur coats. When they got to Washington they found every one there, in their shirt sleeves, while they were regarded with as much curiosity as a band of Esqui maux would be on the streets of Minne apolis. The Southern members will be afraid to come to Minneapolis early in July. _ Hard For a New Man. Owatonna Journal anil Herald. Minnesota is likely to exert very little influence in the present congress. She ! sends a delegation of new men (except Nelson), who are likely to receive but little recognition on the committees. Judge Wilson may fare better than some of the rest because of his ability and membership of the dominant party. But it is hard for a new man, even such as Judge Wilson, to exert a marked in fluence during his first term. — No Flies on It. Glencoc Enterprise. Cleveland's message has no Hies on it. There is nothing about it which indi cates a lack of purpose or innocuous des uetude.. If the president's message voices the sentiments of the Democratic party, then Minnesota conies as near be ing unanimously Democratic as any state in the Union, regardless of our time-honored custom of giving Republi can majorities. <*•* A Case lor Investigation. Farmiugton Tribune. Red Wing people are now asserting that it is costing' more to get the reform school than it did to get the decision of the commission. It might be interest ing to know just what it cost them to get that decision, and what the •■cost"' was for. The next legislature out-lit to cause a thorough investigation of the whole matter. An Object in View. Elk River Star-News. Just as we expected, State Auditor Braden has the gubernatorial bee in his bonnet. The genial state auditor did not make that unusual land-selling tour through the state this fall altogether for pleasure or a sense of official duty. How the newspaper boys will relish his can didacy remains to be seen. Sour Grapes. St. Cloud Times. Certain Republican newspapers say that the president's anti-taxation mes sage is a schoolboy composition. It would be well for some of their edi tors if they were as proficient in school boy lore. . - :v* .'** ■j*» Awaiting McGill's Action. Glencoe Enter**-rise. Gov. McGill has been emphatically requested by ex-Gov. Hubbard to come to the rescue of Red Wing on the state reform school matter. The public is anxiously waiting to see how McGill will cover the situation. A 

FOOL'S WISDOM. If there is one thing the railroad com mission of this state should be excori ated for by the public press, it is its approval of the kind of fire extinguish ers the railroads have placed upon their passenger trains. Various documents lately issued by this commission and bearing the signature of that unique public character, Eli Warner, have announced that the commission was tearing its pants to have the danger les sened upon passenger trains. The com mission inspected the apparatus pro vided by the companies and approved it. All this has been a farce of the worst nature. Within the last fortnight I have traveled over several railways in this state which the commission has blessed with its sanction of their fire apparatus. On one road I found placed in the end of each car a small fire ex tinguisher. The conductor laughed when I pointed to them. "Yes." he said, "they are for fire pro tection; but, Lord bless you. they are absolutely worthless. They don't hold more than a quart of fluid, and that wouldn't extinguish a match." On another road I saw hand grenades hung up. When it is understood that in the fire departments of large cities 200-gallon chemical engines can scarcely control a fire that has any headway, what is to be expected of these small grenades and fire extinguishers? Com petent railroad men tell me that one severe shock to a train would absolutely destroy the usefulness of these extin guishers, and that in case of fire they are not to be depended on one moment. Why are they put on the trains'.' "To comply," said a railroad oflicial, laugh ing, "with a law that the state commis sion is enforcing in the letter, but not the spirit." * * The people are long in coming to an understanding in respect to wrongs in flicted upon them. But if they ever re alize what the present railroad' commis sion was appointed for, their wrath must be. terrible. Gov. McGill was urged to appoint men to it who would enforce the laws. What did he do? He chose John L. Gibbs to destroy the tat ter's ambition for the governorship: he chose Horace Austin to cancel a po litical debt, and he retained Gen. Becker because the law compelled him to appoint a Democrat. Despite all the protests of sensible and wise men he retained Eli Warner because of the latter's capability as a partisan politi cian. As now constituted I find the principal work of the commission to In* in filling minor offices with either polit ical henchmen or relatives. 1 took the list the Globe published some time ago of appointees under the commission. 1 handed it to a prominent Republican and asked him who these men were. His answers ran like this: "This is a relative of Eli Warnlu.'' "And so is this one.*' "He worked for Gibbs." "A friend of Cant. 

JAMES." "He voted for McG-ill.'' "One of Warner's friends." "This one got his position by giving up his seat in the state convention to Warxee." "This one helped Hint." Not one word said as. to their capabil ities for the positions— solely because they were the creatures of a po litical machine. Fie on such appoint ments and the men who make them ! * * Francis Baasen, postmaster at Xew Ulm, and in the early history of Minne sota a secretary of state, bore for a long time the peculiar nickname of "Brx<; Baasex." It was in lSiKior V.) that ho received this title. There had been a lynching at Monticello. and the excite ment caused by it led the governor to order out the local militia companies of St. Paul and send them up there. As one of the governor's staff Baaskx went along. He was an ardent temperance man in those days. On his arrival at Monticello he found that some of the soldiers had brought along a keg of beer. That was too much for his dig nity. Waiting until it was dark, he found the keg, knocked the bung in and ran the liquor out. In revenge he was dubbed "Bi'xu Baasex "and the name stuck to him for years. * » 1 am reminded by the president's free trade message of some of the trash pro tectionist Republicans in this state have offered to the public in support of their side of the question. Ten year-* or more ago, when Mask H. Dixxell was a protectionist, he said this in a political speech delivered in the southern part of the state : "I was at Fairmont the other night delivering a speech. An old farmer sitting oh the front seat rose and asked me this question: " -If a wagon costs $100 in the United States and $60 in Canada, why can't I be allowed to buy my wagons in Canada without paving a duty?' ••Fellow citizen," 1 said to that man. "if the American wagon isn't good enough for you, you are luxurious." Mr. Duxxell has reformed since then on the tariff question, but the above is a fair sample of protection rot. * * Anther form of argument used by the Republicans against the Democrats is well illustrated by a portion of a speech made in this state some dozen years ago by lliamWixdo.u, late of Minnesota. Mr. Wisdom had worked his audience up to a fever heat by describing the dangers the country faced through hav ing a Democratic house of representa tives. "My friends," he said, "at the last ses sion of congress the Democrats abol ished forty-three of our foreign con sular stations. They claim they did this because their support cost thousands of dollars, and they were of no benefit. They point to this act as one of re trenchment. :';■'*;" ■-•'.-■; ••My friends, shall I tell you why they abolished these forty-three consulates? "Why did they do it? o: "Because they wanted to haul down the American flag in forty-three foreign ports." Think of this from a sane man— a man with whiskers a man who has been re ferred to as a Nestor of wisdom ! And still Minnesota remains Republican. * *• The free trade Republicans in this tatc find themselves between Scylla and Charybdis by the president's mes sage and the certainty of the renoinina tion of Blaixe. Gen. J. H. Baker; who is a free trader, said the other evening: "I am in the position of
