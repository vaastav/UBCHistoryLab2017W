The application of the merit system to the Ciril Service in oar insular possessions is the theme of a brief but particularly earnest pas page in the Presidents Message. What is said ■upon the general subject of that system in our own domestic service Is in accord with the con sistent utterances of Presidents for the last twenty years, and with the well known convic tions and practice of Mr. Roosevelt himself. But these last two or three years have developed a new and important phase of the subject, to •which the President addresses himself with en pas*n? frankness and vigor. After dwelling upon the importance of the merit system in the United States, he urges that it is even more im portant to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions. Not an office, he declares, should be filled In the Philippines or Porto Ilico with any regard to the man's partisan affiliations or service, and the administration of those islands should thus be made and kept as free from the suspicion of partisan politics as is that of the army and navy. . The President does not enlarge upon the rea sons why the non-partisan merit system is especially desirable in the insular service. These should be, however, obvious to all. Every con sideration which makes It desirable here makes It equally desirable there. In addition, it is to be noted, in the first place, that it is necessary to give our alien wards the best possible service In order to deserve and to command their confi dence. Nine-tenths of the troubles ■which na tions have had with their colonial possessions have arisen from the fact that the people of the latter thought, rightly or wrongly, that they •were being: ill governed, plundered or oppressed by the administrators sent out from the mother country. That was the complaint of these col onies against George 111, and of Cuba and the i Philippines against Spain- Surely, we must run " no risk of having the same complaint made against us by the islands we have rescued from Spanish xnlsgorernment. Aarain. there Is the consideration that the peo pie of the islands are not as expert ln govern mental affairs as those of this country, and can not therefore so effectively act as a check upon the doings of civil administrators. In the T'nited States it Is not easy for an officeholder to go far wrong without being detected by his neighbors or by the people he serve?. We owe it to the less astute— because less experienced— people of the Islands to guard them in advance against maladministration by the most careful selection of their civil servants. A third point is that dis tance from home and from the homo govern ment, and authority or service among a de pendent people, sometimes serve as temptations to evil doing. Yerres never would have thought of trying to do in Rome what he unhesitatingly did in Sicily. Many a man who would be tolerably honest in a Washington bureau, and reasonably just in dealing with bis neighbors in New-York or Chicago, would become hopelessly corrupt in far away Manila and tyrannical in the extreme in managing a remote Indian agency. If the temptation to ill doing increases with the distance at which the service is to be performed, there should be an equal increase ln carefulness of scrutiny into the character and fitness of the applicant for place. Finally, it is desirable to avoid partisanship in the insular service, because the party politics of the I'nited States has and can have no proper place in our insular possessions. Porto Rico and the Philippines will have their own political parties, formed upon their own local issues: but there can be no identity and no valid connection between them and the parties and issues of the I'nlted States. The islands are not members of this Union. They have no part in our elections for President and Congress, or in any of our govern mental or political affairs. The policy of this nation toward them should be as non-partisan, as consistent and as continuous as is its policy toward foreign lands. And an important step toward that end will be the fulfilment of the President's suggestion in making the insular Civil Service non-partisan and in basing it en tirely upon the merit system. 

SOME BRIDGE EXAMPLES. It is reported credibly that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company will presently build a bridge n.ross the North River, so as to run its trains directly into the heart of this city. It will build the bridge at its own expense, as it has built the ]^ SSPr bridges on its various lines, and will ex pect to make a profit on it as a simple business enterprise. The project seems entirely feasible. and thereports of It are generally accepted as true and as indicating nothing at all extraordi nary. The bridge will be the largest in the world, of course; bnt then it is only reasonable that such a structure should be erected by one of the greatest lailroad corporations in the world. At the same time one of the largest street railroad companies in the world (for the "Huckleberry" system is commonly understood to be a practical adjunct of the Metropolitan! is trying to get a through line across the little Harlem River. But instead of building its own bridge, at its own expense, as it could well af ford to do and as it ought to be compelled to do. it is seeking through legislative favor to grab a bridge belonging to the people of this <-ity. which was built by the people for an entirely different purpose. The contrast between the two cases is striking, und it is not at all creditable to the latter corporation. If a steam railroad can afford to bridge the North River, an electric street railroad, with a monop oly of surface traffic in a city cf two million people, should afford to bridge the Harlem at one-tenth the cost of the former undertaking. We have no doubt It would do so, if only the government of this city were loyal to its trust and would reiuse to let the trolley tracks invade the Central Bridge. So in time would the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company have built its own bridge across the East River, if only the government had barred it from all hut monop olizing the Brooklyn Bridge. Tt is because we so easily give away public property that cor porations thus grab ir. The contrast between the examples of the ]u"oposed North River bridge and the proposed Central Bridge grab should prove rich in food for thought to the rulers and to the people of this city. THE rnUßril AND SIX DAY OPEXIXI. It is the opinion of '"Zion's Herald." an influen tial Methodist paper published in Boston, that an overwhelming majority of religious people are opposed to the opening of saloons on Sunday. This is especially true, it declares, of the three largest religious bodies in the country— the Bap tist, Roman Catholic and Methodist Episcopal churches— while the clergymen who advocate Sunday opening number less than one In a thousand of the clergymen of the country. Only one Baptist paper, "The Watchman," of Bos ton. advocates local option, which, of course, carries with it the possibility of Sunday open ing. The Methodist papers and ministers, with out a sinsrle exception, are opposed to the propo sition. The Roman Carbolic press also opposes the idea, and Archbishop Corrigan the other day, in addressing the triennial diocesan synod of the archdiocese, assembled in St. Patrick's Cathedral, pronounced against a "Continental Sunday" and condemned any change in the Sunday laws. Arguing from these facts, there fore. "Zion's Herald" declares, "no movement '•that cannot carry the Baptist, the Roman "Catholic and the Methodist Episcopal churches "can succeed with the legislature of any com "monwealth in this land. And when these three "great bodies unite, as they now do, against the "proposition for the Sunday saloon, it is doomed "in advance." Doubtless the opposition of these three great religious bodies ought to have and will have great weight when the question comes to be decided. But if religious sentiment opposed to Sunday opening is to be taken into account, it seems only fair that religious sentiment favor able to the measure should also be considered. even though it represents a minority of the religious people of the country. What all must desire is a settlement of the Sunday saloon question in accordance with the principles of justice and morality, and the minority which favors Sunday opening may conceivably have as clear a conception of the moral questions involved as has the majority. There Is no In herent divinity in a majority, as "Zion's Herald" would doubtless be among the first to main tain if it found itself on the minority side of this question. Politicians may properly accept the decision of the majority on any such issue; bat religious men are morally bound to ask if the majority rightly represents the essential justice and morality involved in an issue that comes up for decision. Now, whether rightly or wrongly, many religions journals and repre sentative religious men do advocate some form of Sunday opening. Besides "The Watchman." already mentioned. "Tlie Independent," "The Outlook" and "The Congregationalist" advocate either local option or Sunday opening, while "The Churchman" refers to the agitation in terms that seem to imply approval of a more liberal Sunday law. Among the clergymen who have tcore or less committed themselves to Sun day opening may be mentioned Drs. Mac Arthur, Parkhurst. Parker Morgan. Rainsford and Savage, and Rabbis Kohler and Grossmann, of this city, and Bishop Doane. of Albany. Many prominent laymen hare also taken the same ground. Are these eminent men wrong on this Question? Do they misrepresent the Church? XEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. MONDAY. DECEMBER 9. 1901. These are questions which must be answered, and they at« not answered by showing that a much iareer number of religious people for vari ous reasons think the other way. Moreover, the fact must be noted that mnny, perhaps the majority, of the religious people pppoocd to Sunday opening base their oppo sition on grounds that cannot be recognized by the State They declare that the legalization of Sunday liquor selling would be a desecration of the Sabbath. Now, the State has no right to legislate in favor of making Sunday a holy day of religion. It can take no cognizance of any alleged desecration of the day. That is an argument that has no place in secular legisla tion Individual religious bodies can bind their members to any observance of Sunday that seems right to them. But the State cau only regard Sunday as a legal holiday and see that nothinsr is done on that day which will inter fere with its due observance by the citizens gen erally, religious and irreligious. The question for the legislature, therefore, is not whether the Sunday opening of saloons would desecrate a holy (Ihv of the Church, but whether it would disturb the peace and quiet of the day and pre vent religious people from observing it accord ing to the dictates of their conscience. It may be that Sunday opening would disturb the peace and order of the day for a majority of citizens. In that case the proposition should be opposed by all good citizens, even those who itsbeUere in Christianity. That there is such a radical division of sentiment on this question among good people is, on the whole, a fortunate cir cumstance, for it insures a decision of the ques tion on Its merits. If all the religious people opposed the proposition there might be danger of the legislature enacting a law recognizing Sunday as a holy day of religion. But as it is, the real issue involved in the question will be brought out, namely, whether Sunday opening Is demanded by expediency and justice, not whether it contravenes certain dogmas of re ligion. A LESSON TO LYNCHERS. A few such lessons as Herbert Man, a young man from this city, administered to some mid night regulators in Virginia a few days ago would have a salutary effect on communities which are always looking for an excuse to take the law into their own hands and inflict sum mary punishment on persons against whom they have a real or imaginary grievance. Somebody started a story, which seems to have been utter ly untrue, that Marx had insulted a young woman living in the neighborhood of his house. It was talked over by the gossips of the coun tryside, and seemed to a few young men to offer an opportunity for a tar and feather party, which they may or may not have been only too willing to give from motives of personal jeal ousy. They made a night visit to Marx and de manded entrance to his house. He. thinking they were burglars— he would have been equally justified if he had known they only intended to pay him the honor of a coat of tar and feathers —resisted by force and arms their attempts to break into his house. The result is that two of his visitors are dead, one lies mortally wounded, and a fourth is nursing a gunshot wound and has reason to be thankful that it is not more serious. Some reports from Virginia say that the per son blamed for starting the gossip may be lynched by the friends of the dead men. Though he is a negro, that is scarcely credible, or would not be in a region where habits of lawlessness were not deepseated. Other and more trust worthy reports represent the Virginia com munity in general, and even the personal friends of the members of the tar and feather party, .ns acquitting Man of all blame and saying that hi* visitors earned what they got. There may be a few reckless spirits who will not share this view, or who, even if they do. will be glad of an excuse to relieve their feelings at the ex pense of a negro. Most sensible people, how ever, will conclude that the negro, in spite of his slanderous tongue, was not the person most to blame. Marx's neighbors, instead of punishing the inventor of idle gossip for their wickedness and folly in believing It and plunging into law lessness on the strength of It, should lenrn not to be so ready with tar kettle, shotgun, rope and firebrand. The sort of treatment that Marx gave his assailants Is a healthful tonic for con stitutions infected with the lynching fever. CnrXESE QUARTERS APLEXTY. While Congressmen are rushing to the front with bills which will raise still higher and thicker walls against the admission of Confu cians within the limits of this republic, the Ah Sings now living in the Chinatowns of New- York and San Francisco and other American cities are chuckling with slant eyed glee. Why shouldn't they be happy? They are here, and it is not likely they will be cast out. They know full well that millions of their fellow countrymen envy their good fortune, and are beating vainly at the barriers which are .«,ot up against their admission to this promised land of milk and honey, of fat sharks' fins and luscious nests of swallows. The French satirist wrote that there is some thing not wholly displeasing in the misfortunes even of our best friends. And so it is with the Chinamen now living in the I'nited States. Presi dent Roosevelt declares that this country must keep its gates closed against yellow floods from the Orient, and in this declaration he has scores of millions of Americans at his back; but n<> per son of common sense is now advocating the exile of the Chinese who have set up their household gods and their sadirons among us. The reso lute conviction of Yankeedom is unquestiouably that the number of hieroglyphic laundries now existent between Beacon Street and the Golden Gate, between the Zenith City of the L'usalted Seas and the low lyiug levels of salt strewn Galveston. is sufficient to meet the urgent de mands of this cosmopolitan commonwealth of the Stars and Stripes. Yet this will be followed in these days by no fresh war cry that "The Chinaman must go!" Let him stay if he is here already. But. as the President hints in his Mes sage, we have enough of him in present condi tions. Those of him "in our midst" in this period are lucky. May they thrive and flourish! 

OUTCASTS FROM NEW-YORK. Good men and true in Connecticut are per turbed in spirit because the prizefighters whom New-York has kicked over the border have flocked to Hartford as a haven of refuge. Those ruffians, driven away by New- York, surely have no just claim to the benevolent hospitalities of New-England. And this should be consid ered also. There was a period when prize fights, disgusting and revolting as they were in cruelty and brutality, were free from suspicion concerning their "squareness." The oldtime sluggers thumped each other in dead earnest, and the "best man"' v/on in every case. Things have changed now. and most of the contests in the ring in this generation are clouded -with suspicion. It is generally believed that with few exceptions the "Terrible Terry s" and the "Smashing Sharkeys" of the present do not try to pound each other with the fiery rage of the Heenans and the Morrisseys, the prizefight champions of the unhappy years of long ago. In those times pugilistic rivals did not expect to go on the stage after a battle in the ring, and there was seldom a dispute as to their genuine zeal and determination. In thi= era the air is thick with a black fop of doubt as to the inside facts of prizeflpbts. Many pessimists have said loudly that these contests have be-n arranged in advance; that they hare been "put up jobs" and "not on the level." to use the expressive slaup of the Bow ery. ' All things being taken into account, why should the State of Connecticut welcome the bruisers whom the State of New-York found it wise to put away? * 

MOXEY AXn BUSINESS. Full returns for November have been pub lished, and give some idea of the vigorous tone of trade and industry. Although stock market operations were four million shares less than last year's, legitimate business was so much greater that bank exchanges exceeded those of 1900 by over 14 per cent, which in turn surpassed all previous years. Similarly, railway earnings exhibited an increase of about 11 per cent over last year, and still more over any other year, notwithstanding the handicap of insufficient cars and many labor controversies. Liabilities of commercial failures were 2(i per cent smaller, while the general range of commodity prices on December 1 showed a gain of 8.7 per cent over the average a month previous, and 11 per cent as compared with a year ago. Detailed figures of pales and shipments in each branch of In dustry tell of the same marvellous progress. For the current month there is the further augmentation of by far the largest holiday trade ever recorded, which has opened earlier than usual, and proceeds at a rate that necessitates much reorder business with the jobbers. Nor mal weather conditions have also helped many lines during the last week. Manufacturing ac tivity is such as to indicate implicit confidence in the wisdom of the Congress just reassembled. Any alarm regarding unwise legislation would be quickly reflected in the withdrawal of invest ments and consequent curtailment of operations. On the contrary, ther^ is a general tendency to enlarge facilities. Foreign commerce weturns are scarcely less satisfactory than reports of domestic trade, al though the home demand in many cases is so large that outside bids receive scant attention, and imports are increased through the inability of producers in the T'nlted States to fill orders. The new position of this country in international affairs was emphasized unmistakably by the un precedented extent to which the press of other nations discussed the President's Message. Financial conditions abroad have been depend ent on the supply of gold that could be drawn from New- York, and continuance of prosperity here is of vital importance to Europe, especially during the interruption to South African gold production. Further exports of the precious metal on Tuesday raised the total since October 30 to $20,250,000, at the season of heaviest mer chandise exports, yet no hardship '.s felt here, and the per capita circulation of money on De cember 1 reached ar new high record of S2.S 711, while commercial paper is readily discounted at 5 per cent. Lower reserves were reported by the leading foreign banks, and a prominent Ger man Institution suspended. Questions Of credit balances were extensively discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, which seems superfluous, as it is a simple mattor to demonstrate that the I'nlted States is still largely a debtor. Recent events t^nd to reduce the volume of our secur ities held abroad, however, and the time will come when our excess of merchandise exports over imports cannot be paid by transfer ot American stocks and bonds. Wall Street has had a week of irregularity and violent fluctuations. After gold had been engaged for export on Monday there was weak ness, followed by recovery for a day or two, and then ending with sharp declines on Friday an>l Saturday. Discrimination was shown by the public, railway shares attracting attention at every reaction, but industrial stocks receiv ing little support. Thus, net changes for the week wen* declines of $2 75 a share for the average of gas and traction properties, $212 for the leading industrials, but only 82 cents a share for the average of the sixty most active railroads. Amalgamated Copper monopolized almost a fifth of the entire week's trading, and at the lowest point showed a decline of TK") per cent from the top price reached In June. While the sudden loss of faith in that concern was the chief de pressing influence, there was also reason for trimming speculative sails in the prospect of firm rates for money. Cold was exported and more may be; the Treasury balance was heavily against the banks, partly through banknote redemption; preparation for a new high record of dividend disbursements ln January loomed up on the financial horizon: dissolution of a large brokerage firm threw many stocks on the mar ket, which was In no condition to absorb such a quentlty; whlie the bank statement showed a reduction in surplus reserve to the lowest point since July d. Reserves are still larger than a year ago, and there Is no cause for alarm. Strong Interests are not sacrificing holdings, and investors would be unwise to part with stocks owned outright, although narrowly margined accounts have been wiped out and stop orders freely uncovered. In sharp contrast to the hesitation and weak ness of the stock market, leading staple prod ucts exhibited unusual animation and strength. Corn continued the leader, not only rising to the highest point of the season, but surpassing all records for more than nine years, which car ries the comparison back to a time when a crop of two billion bushels was considered phenom enal, Instead of below normal, as Is now the case. High prices naturally restricted foreign buying, exports for the week falling to less than 5 per cent of the movement a year ago, and touching a new low record for any week since this cereal was first freely sent abroad in ISO 7. Attractive prices caused larger receipts, but there Is every evidence that the yield is severely curtailed, and the liberal substitution of wheat as fodder has advanced the leading cereal to the best price of the crop year, and seven cents above the figure prevailing a year ago, when the yield was known to be short. Meats have nat urally followed grain prices, low records of aver age weight receipts at Chicago giving additional support. It Is a year of most profitable prices for the agricultural community, even cotton planters at last realizing better figures. Condi tions at the South have been seriously disturbed by the combination of decreased crop and only moderate prices, but there is now evidence of a share in the general upward tendency. The official estimate of only 0,C>74,00<> bales was the first stimulating factor, followed by heavy spin ners' takings and exports. Mr. Croker says he cannot get a quiet mo ment here. New-York has had few quiet mo ments since Mr. Croker took charge of its af fairs. One wonders whether Representative Wachter, of Maryland, who wishes to abolish the an nual football game between the army and navy cadets, was one of the twenty-five thousand spectators at the contest ln Philadelphia, or if, indeed, he ever saw the game he denounces as "unnecessary, brutal, degrading and more dan gerous to life than a prizefight." We have not hitherto observed that even the most ladylike of the professional objectors to football have made loud outcries against the sport as prac tised by the stalwart young representatives of the two fighting services, for whose future of action and conflict the game might be thought no improper preparation. The friends of foot ball, however, need not feel much uneasiness over the legislative outlook. Representative Met-.alf, of California, has introduced a bill pro viding that the cadet game shall be an annual fixture and always played in Washington; and the present occupant of the White House may be depended UDon to safeguard the rifhts and privileges of those who, to quote one of his fa vorite expressions, "hit the line hard." If the time should come when the knights of the gridiron need a champion. In the second year of the century New-York is likely to have a fair supply of street lights and street signs. The dark lantern system of government, with nothing open, plain and bright, a system which sought only to mislead, delude and baffle honest citizens and visitors to Manhattan, has only a few weeks more of ex istence. _ Bissert behind the bars. Next! The old lines of professional baseball seem to be wavering. Players of note are weary of the slave driving of which they have been vic tims, and demand that they shall be treated like men and not like stockyard cattle. The buying and selling of pitchers and catchers and fielders has been overdone. How lank and lean Tammany stockings will be on Christmas Eve! Theatre ticket speculators are reported to favor an increase of their license fee, in order to crowd out irresponsible outsiders from their goodly company, and "to protect the public from imposition"! Cheek of bronze and arctic frigidity must be laid upon the shelf when such an absolute zero of sublimated effrontery comes to the fore. Devery's waist line may fall in later. Professional beggars of the worst sort have been so numerous and insistent in the shopping district of late that the arrests made in the last few days were sorely needed, and cannot fail to bring about a better condition of affairs. New- York should never be suffered to sink to the level of Naples in street mendicancy.

Colonel Arthur Lynch, -who has been elected to Parliament from Galway City, is about forty years old and was born in Australia. He was edu cated at Melbourne University, and, after earning a living as a mathematical master, took service In the engineers' department of the Victorian Rail ways. Ultimately he became a journalist, and when the war broke out in South Africa he was first en gaged as correspondent for a Paris newspaper.
