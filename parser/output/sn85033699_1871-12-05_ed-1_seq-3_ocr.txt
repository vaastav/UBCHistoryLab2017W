Toamend the francliise Ian', by repealing tha' f:ure wWcli rofluires of voters evi tlenee that tliey have paid a poll-tax. The Judiciary Committee recommended the re jection of the bill. Messrs. Samsell and Tillman opposed the bill. Mr. Tillman said he regretted that the Cpustitui ion:il Convention adopted Uie' pro vision which requires the Legislature to fix a time for the payment of a poll-tax an 8 to prescribe a p"riod for which tlio tax should 1)2 p.dd. He liad no doubt that certain bad practices which prevailed in clifferont por tions of the Slate induced the convention to adopt the provision. At the time and be fore the convention assembled, large num bers of persons were shipped to Memphis, Clarksville and other cities aud counties,for the purpose of assisting one side or the oth er in their electioneering schemes. He saw no great wrong in that provision of the con stitution in tlie act intend 'd to give it force and eflct. but it was contended that the 1 powers of' tax collectors might bo used for selfish or party purposes, and he believed tliat this was a question which would be agluted lx:f in the people at eveiy election, and be the subject of discord and dtecusskminevoryLpcH-Uuri'. ne would, therefore, vote f.ir n lull wlr.o!-. woujd pU'e it beyond the p-iwer of tax rotl vtors to dc fea the wis!ies of the people, but he could not vote for the present bill, because, in im pelling the aot heretofore passed, and fixing no tlm-J as contemplated by the Constitu tion, there w add be a failure to okservc either the lett or the spirit of the Consti tution. He IHieved, however, that the LesUlature m! ; it fik'a titrff in the future at which the n mer.l of Tt poll-i.ix should be required, uhout a violation of the Con stitution, and by wluh time the Constitu tion could be changed,if tlie people desired it. He believed that the requirement of the pavmenl of a poll-tax as a prerequisite to tlie rinht to vcte would always be the sub ject of discussion, aud to avoid that, with out saying whether it was right or wrong, o n,iiVm be willing to sec it discontinued, for ftempuntUsmallto beinade the &uitfctaui'iigiuiuon'iuiu legislation inpany General Assembly and at anv election.

Senator Trumbull on the Situation. The Passive Policy Declared a Failure Xo Scrions Division in tho Radical Party Apprehended. Special to the Louisville Courier-Journal. Washingtox, Dec. 3. I have iust had detailed to me, by a prominent Southern politician, the particulars of a conversation, had within the last day or two, with Sena tor Trumbull, of 111. My informant, who is nunseit an ex-united fetates senator, states that ho met Judge Trumbull in the UDrary ot congress, ana tnat, alter ex changing friendly salutations, he asked the senator wnetner ne would consent to the use of his name as a conservative candidate for the Presidency against Gen. Grant. The Illinois statesman replied with more than usual emphasis: ".no, sir, 1 would not." "And whvnot?" "For many reasons.' Judje Tnimbull said in substance: "In tbe first place, I am satisneu wnere l am. l consider a seat m the Senate of the United States a position in winch 1 can be more useful than any other, and I believe it to be as honorable as any under the Government if Its duties be efficiently and properly discharged. In the next place, I do not agree with the pro gramme which has been marked out by those who reluse to support the candidacy of the President for re-election. I am con scious of tlie need of many reforms, and I am daily striving to accomplish them. But I do not believe that a revolution of parties would be salutary. I do not believe either tlie people cf the North or South are ready to profit by such a change." "aim wny not" "Because the people of the South have really accepted nothing and are not willing to co-operate with the liberals of the North in settling the practical relations of society on a sure and generous basis. I know tliat the South has much to complain of. But so have the liberal Republicans. It is not the Rebel element, perhaps, but the nature of things that the South should not realize the complete overthrow of the old order and a complete change of the domestic policy. I believe that the defeat of Gen. Grant would involve a reaction at the South, whose consequences would be even worse than the present state of affairs." Don't you think Gen. Grant meditates the permanent usurpation of the Executive office'1" "No, I do not. My opinion is that Gen". Grant is, in the main, a conservative inan. He ha3 made mistakes. But I can not say they justify his removal." "Wliat are your personal relations?" "Very friendly. I have opposed some of his mcasuies; but I have no personal feelinc against him, and, indeed, Uiis is one of the reasons why it is disagreeable to have my name mentioned m tlie connection you name." "The Southern Democracy would sup port you with pleasure.'' "lou are mistaken. I he Democracy is yet too strong in numbers to disband, for 1 that is the meaning of the passive policy. inree millions of Democratic voters can not afford to sell themselves to two or three hundred thousand Republican voters, and tliat tor a moss ol pottase which tlie Re publicans and not the Democrats are to en joy. 1 don't believe tliey will do it. 1 think the passive policy already a failure-" "L,ikc the new departure:' " "No, not exactly. The new departure was a necessity, win or lose. Had the Democrats not adopted it, but in its place had adopted the platform of 1808, they would have been still more disastrously beaten. The new departure made no re cruits, because the people did not believe it honest. The Democratic party leaders did what they could no longer avoid that is, accept the amendments and tlie Republi cans nave to tiianK sucii writers as Mr. Stephens and Mr. Forsythe that the step in advance did not make further in-oads. By 1S70, the issues of the war, the amendments and the Ku-Klux will be out of the way, and there may be a new and complete re organization of parties. But not now." " liat do you think of the Jvu-Klnx? ' "They may be exaggerated. But there is enough of unpunished violence at the South to justify the newspapers in all the outcry they are making. This alone would beat the Democtacy." "lhen you think the fight next year will be a straight-out tnrty allair?" "I think it will be as far as the Republi cans are concerned. The party is not really ivided. Its internal discussions merely ex hibit the exercise of individual free will and do it good and not harm. It will act as a body, and I think'will poll a' larger vote than it did in 180S, no matter what frame work or what candidates are opposed to it. Tlie people believe in the Republican party on account of its liberal discussions." I am assured in saving that the op inions of Senator Tnimbull are also the opinions of Senator Sumner. THE nosnoits of 

AXDEESOX- TIXEE. A letter irom Thomas Barlow appears in the Albany lraas, which charges squarely home upon Ulysses S. Grant tho responsi bility lor the imrrors of Andersonville. The Confederate Commissioners for the ex- cliange of prisoners repeatedly urged the authorities at Washington to permit an ex- . urant ret used to allow it. lie testines that more lives were lost by Grant's telegrams "than all the British soldiers killed in the ware of Napoleon," and "these lives were spent as apart of the system of attack upon the rebellion designed by the wisdom of the (.eneral-in-Chipf of the armies, to destroy it by depletion." tH an early day (Jrant lorbade Butler to receive any more prisoners on exchange. uur poor ooys in prison were characterized by Meredilii as being "thousands of loath some skeletons" and our commander re fused to exchange them that they micht live. From the time Grant refused to exchange In April, 1&04, Butler said lie sought to ac complish an exchange. Butler said ex change; the rebel authorities said exchange; out urant said no, there should be no ex change. llis policy was to let them starve as a measure to prevent the liberty of n-bel prisoners in our own well provisio icd prisons. The htial tatal order of Grant, which was a death-warrant to thous i.ds and thousands of our soldiers, was on '.lie lbth ot August, Jfc04, which closed the doors of hope to all prisoners. Our boys had become so reduced by starvation and filth as to be deemed mined for future service, and theref:e weif V.nt beyond the pale of humanity in the t-Mima-tion of an aspiring General, Ik onsi.lrivd them as dead, and tliey were deemed lit only to be left in the grave at Anderson ville. We will let the telegram of Grant speak for itself: "On the sutyect ot exchange l diiier from Gen. Hitchcock. It is hard on our men held in Southern prisons not to ex change them, but it is humanity to those left in the ranks to fight our battles. Every mm released on parole or otherwise be comes an active soldier at once, either directly or indirectly. If we commence a sy-u-m of exchange wliich liberates all prif- :irs tau-en, we will have to nuiit uutu the South is exterminated. K we hold those caught, they amount to more than dead men. At this pellicular time to release all rebel prisoners North would compromise our safety here. "U. S. GitANT, "Lieutenant General." This inhuman order caused the death of it liuist twenty thousand men. Butler puts the figures higher. TROUBLE IN THE PARTY. GruutSnnbs the TcHnessee Kadlcnls Some Iasldn History. From the Cincinnati Commercial. Knoxviixe. Nov. 28, 1871. It is my nainful dutv to record the fact tliat all is not harmonious between the Republicans of East Tennessee and tho President. He has got along with them so well fofso long a time that the recent disturbance of the pleasant relations 14 all the more melan choly. The band ot friendship between Brownlow, Butler aud Maynard and the President has never been oi a tough nature, aud there are those who wonder now barn of so many strings could keep in tune so Ions. It was atriendship not sealed wiiu a kiss, nor even with a present. It is doubt ful if all tho East Tennessee statesmen ever gave Grant as much as a cigar; there- lore it required but a genua breeze to oiow their love to the four .winds, and make them no Ioneer examples of abiding confi dence. Maynard is as cold as the North Pole duTuia a hard freeze, and would not give, two dollars and a half for any man's friendship not that he loves lnendship less, but the two dollars and a half more. Brown low has a wanner heart and is more char itable, and the beggar is never turned away from, his door with an empty stomach, but he confines his gills to those who need them, therefore tirant has never got one Neither are any of tho illustrious trio re lated to the President either by consanguini ty or affinity, hence the bond ot unity ana brotherly love was not so stromr but what a little unpleasantness about a District At torney recently snapped it. Rinht here let me caution the reader not to believe tliat the Tennessee Republicans will "go back on Grant," for they have no where to co to and can home, li urown- low, for instance, should refuse lo support urant, he would hnd lumselt on the same platform with Andy Johnson, which would make him hop like a turkey on a hot stove. The time has not yet come for the lion and the lamb to lie down together, and when it does come I fear tho best place to look for the lamb will be in the lion's stomach. A C.Camp,ayomi2manfromMt. Vernon, Uhio, is District Attorney lor fiast Tennes see. When Roderick ltandom llutler was presented for stealing pension money,Camp aided in the prosecution, aud since then it has been the darling object of Butler's life to get Camp removed. A man, and espe cially a Congressman, naturally does not like to go to the pemtentiary, nor violently love a man who tries to send him there. But that was not all. One of Butler's neph ews was arrested and prosecuted by Camp for forging a pension certificate, and draw ing the money on it from a bank in this city, which money had to be refunded to the Government by the bank, all of which was distasteful to Conzressman Roderick. Hav jug to pay the money back for his nephew !was probably what was the matter. Butstill that was not all ol the cause ol enmity of Butler to Camp. He was surety upon the bond of a defaulter, and as such was sued by Camp, as District Attorney, for about six thousand dollars. All this was of course distasteful to But ler, and he went for the Ohio Chinee in a way that was learlui to see. lie either got Maynard and Brownlow stirred upon the subject, or they got themselves stirred up, and the three preferred charges. These charges are not specific, merely general in sinuations of incompetency, and so forth. The trouble with Camp is that he has prosecuted all offenders of the law, without regard to their politics or their standing in society. Delias been particularly severe on mountain distillers, who seem to think thst because they "fought agin the Rebels' they have a life right to make whisky, re eardless of government duty. Nine-tenths of the whisky makers of East Tennessee are loyal men, and to look over Camp's docket, it did appear although he was prosecuting loyal men in a way that was not altogether child-like aud bland. Four-fifths of the cases were against the Republicans. The cry was raised that Camp was hurting the 1 i i - : 1 1 pariy, auu ne was, u cuiuiuu iui; ia a n njure the party. li ut this was not au ol uamp s improper! conduct. Brownlow has a son-in-law who is pension agent at this place, and Camp took some steps towards making him give a sufficient bond. Indeed in the administra tion of his office, he has not spared loyal men, and as the consequence he has got the active enmity of Butler, and Butler has worked upon Brownlow and Maynard, un til the three demanded his lemoval. The President complied, and Camp telegraphed to Delano. Delano is a personal friend to Camp, and had Urant to reinstate him in office, which was done within a few days after his removal, or suspension. This was a direct snub to Browidow, Maynanl, and Butler, giving them au opportunity to learn that they don't stand very high with the Administration. Camp is a straight-out party man, and fearing that tho saub would lead to "inliar moni;'us relations" between the President, Delano, and the Tennessee Republicans, he Saturday telegraphed his resignation to the President. By doing this, he has sacri ficed four or five thousand dollars a year, but healed what would liave been a dis agreeable breach in the party. Brownlow, Maynard, and Butler never would have consented to the continuance of Camp iii office, and there was no way to prevent a serious rumpus in tlie ranks, but to resign. 

&EXATOB BKOWNLOW. Since writing the above, I met Col. John Brownlow upon the street, and with him walked down toward the "senator s house. "Will your father attempt to get to Wash ington at the beginning of the session"' I asked, as he walked along. "Oh, yes; he starts Friday, but he is rather secret about it, for so many country people swarm in to see him about their claims. Tliey think tliat he can go to the Secretary of the Treasury and tell him that they want their money, and he will send it. They have very ridiculous notions of how business is conducted." We passed a historic building by the way, a two-story, tUmble-down allair, where the first Legislature of the State held their first session, aud drew a dollar and a lialf a day for their services. Here also assembled the first Constitutional Convention, and after ward General (or Judge) Andrew Jackson held Court in the same historic shed. Upon entering the Senator's house we found him lying upon a large sofa, a negro rubbing his feet. He is in wretched health, but no moie than he has been for two years. His hands and feet are continually jerking and shaking with the palsy. He cannot read unless the book or paper is fastened to a frame in front of him. He cannot speak above a whisper, and some days his strength is so far gone that he cannot do that. In deed, he is as helpless as an infant. Nothing but constant care and watcliing upon the part of his family and friends and his own iron determination keeps him alive. The Senator hates the Democracy as bad as Johnson hates Grant, which is a forcible comparison. Both are extreme in their hate. In speaking of State affairs the Governor acknowledged that he had been badly sold outinSenter. "We were deceived in the man," he said, and evidently regretted hav ing voted for him. He claims to have done it as a choice between two evils, Bill Stokes having been the other evil; but if it was to do over again 1 think he would come to a different opinion as to who was the biggest evil. Referring to the recent troubles that Stokes has got i;Uo, he said he feared it would co hard ith tbe old man. lie also made fifl deil iration, wliich is no new thins, i-..t 'be Republicans of Tennessee are in "i -u odor." Led by such men as Stokes, bt-iiter, Butler, Jerusalem Smith, Jim Muliiiis, bniu. Arnell, and Tom Hamil ton, it ami.l not be otherwise.
