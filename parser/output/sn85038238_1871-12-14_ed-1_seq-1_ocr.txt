Yesterday there occurred on the Ore gon & California Railroad, between this city and Salem, one of the most thrilling rauroaa incidents we ever Heard ol. w hen the down train came near one of the sta tions on the road it was going at full speed, in order to make up time, as it was a few minutes behind. The road at this point runs through a cut something more than a mile in length, and in entering it the road makes a curve so that the engi neer cannot see entirely through it So, as he thundered along yesterday, he little thought what stirring times were upon him. He had hardly gotten into the cut befofehesaw a woman riding leisurely through it, and with perfect nonchalance using the center of the track. She was not more than half way through the cut. and barely a quarter of a mile ahead of him. He immediately whistled "down breaks," and sounded the warning. The woman, hearing the peculiar death whistle of the locomotive, looked over her shoulder and saw the train rushing at her. She did not shriek, nor faint, nor give up all hope, but, like a true Webfoot, her courage rose equal to the emergency, and without, a moment's hesitation, she com menced swinging her riding whip from one shoulder of her steed to the other. thereby urging him to exert his utmost speed. The whip, and, perhaps, the shrieking of the steam-whistle, caused the animal ridden by the lady to put in its best licks, and he made about as rapid time as any animal 'ever seen in Oregon ; but each instant the iron horse gained upon me one composed oi nesn and muscle. Ihe shrieking of the locomotive's whistle caused the passengers to look out oi ine windows, and upon their discover ing wnat was tue matter tne wildest ex citement ensued. Several jumped for ward and seized the bell-rope, and com menced pulling on it as if they could stop the train by that means. The brakemen were exerting all their strength on the brakes, and the engineer had cut off the connection, and was doins all that he knew to stop the train, while the woman was doing tier level best to make that bit ot norse-nesn rise to the speed of " Helnibold ;" but, all in vain ; the loco motive kept gaining on the horse and its rider, and there was hardlv a person on the train who did not expect that both the woman and horse would be killed. There was perhaps thirty feet interven ing between the cow-catcher and the horse's heels, when, fortunately for the woman, sne observed a place wnicn was a little wider than usual, and, with steady rein, she guided the fleeing horse from the track and endeavored to press him against the wall of the cut in order that the train might pass by without injury.. In doing this the woman was en courasred by Mr. Sam Winans, the con ductor, who had run forward and got out on the locomotive. A few seconds only passed by .when the fiery monster poked his nose past the rump of the horse.- At this moment Mr. Winans threw his whole force against the animal, and held him until the tram stopped, and then a rous ing cheer of gratification and joy" at the escape of the woman from a terrible death was given.

WAsirar,TTK, December 4, lKtl. The following Is the President's Message, this day delivered to Congress : To the Senate and Hovneqf Brprettntatittt : In addressing my third annual message to the law-making branch of the Government, it is gratifying to he able to state that dur ing the past year success has generally at tended the effort to execute all the "laws found upon the statute-books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of laws already enacted, but to learn their spe cial intent, and to enforce them accordingly. The past year has, under a wise Provi dence, been one of general prosperity to the nation. It has, however, been attended with more than the usual chastisements in lhss of life and property by storm and fire. These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our coun try, and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign nations, which goes far toward alleviating th distress occasioned by the calamities. The benevolent, who have so generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes, will reap their reward in the consciousness of having performed a noble act, receiving the grate ful thanks of the men, women and children whose sufferings they have relieved. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an eventful one in witnessing two great nations, speaking one language, and having one Uneaire, settling, bv peace ful arbitration, disputes of long standing, and liable at any time to bring those nations into bloody and hostile conflict. An example has thus been set, which, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civil ized nations, and be the final means of returning to productive indus try millions of. men maintained to settle the cfisputes of nations by the bayonet and broadsword. I transmit herewith a copy f the treaty alluded to, which has been concluded since the adjourn ment of Congress with Her Britannic Majes ty, and a copy of the protocols on the con- lerences or tne commissioners Dy wnom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between the two nations. Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recom mend Congress at an early day to make the necessarr provision tor tne tribunal at Geneva, and for the several Commissions on the part of the United states, called for by the treaty, llis Majesty, the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty, the Emperor of Brazil, have each consented, on the joint request of the two rowers, to name an armirator for the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably ex pressed for the readiness with which the joint request has been complied with by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been pleased to comply witn tne joint request ot the two Governments, and has consented to act as tire arbitrator or the disputea water boundary between the United States and Great Britain. The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as be tween themselves certain principles of pub lic law for which the United States have con tended from the commencement of their his tory. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of the other maritime powers, and to invite them to ac cede to them. Negotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which the invita tion is to be extended to the Powers. I rec ommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fish eries, and to the other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to be come operative as soon as the proper legisla tion shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its possessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become operative before the fishermen of the United States be gin to make their Arrangements for the com ing season. I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith, to the Governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those states, respectively, the necessary action on their part, to carry into enect tne object or tne ar ticle of the treaty which contemplates the use of the canals on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers forming the boundary, in terms of equity, by the inhabitants of both countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object, and the benefits to flow therefrom, will secure the speedy approval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. I renew the recommendation for an appro priation for determining the true position of the 4Mtli parallel of latitude, where it forms the boundary between the United States and the British North American possessions be tween the Lake of the Woods and the sum mit of the Rocky Mountains. The early ac tion of Congress in the recommendation named would put it in the power of the War uepartment to place a force in tne ncitt uur ing the next summer. The resumption of diplomatic relations be tween France and Germany has enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended to the Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular representa tives of the United States in that eountry. It is just to add that the delicate duty of this protection has been performed by the Minis ter and the Consul at Paris and the various Consuls in France, under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well as with prudence ana tact. Their course has received the commendation of the German Government, and has wounded no suscepti bility of the French. The Government of the Emperor of Ger many continues to manifest a friendly feeling toward the United States, and a desire to har monize with the moderate and just policy which this Government maintains in its rela tions with Asiatic Powers, as well as with the South American Republics. I have given assurance that the friendly feelings of that Government are fully shared by the United States. The ratifications of the consular and naturalization connections with the Austro- Hungarian Empire have been exchanged. I have been officially informed of the annex ation of the States of the Church to the King dom of Italy, and the removal of the Capital oi that ajngaem to ttome. in muKinuu; with the established policy of the United States, I have recognized this change. The ratification of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy has been exchanged, and the two fowers have agreea in their treaty that, property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between the two rowers. The United States have spared no oppor tunity of incorporating this rule into the ob ligations of nations. The Forty-first Con gress, at its third session, made an appro priation for the organization of a mixea i commission of adjudication upon the claims j of the citizens of the United States against i Spain, growing out of the insurrection in Cuba. That Commission has since been or ganized. I transmit herewith the corres pondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this Commission will afford the claimants a com- j plete remedy for their injuries. It has been made the agreeable duty of the : United States to preside over a conference at Washington, between the plenipotentia ries of Spain and the allied South American Republics, which haS resulted in on ormistice, with the reasonable assurance of a perma nent peace. The intimate and friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Russian Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his Government to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospi table reception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that Government. The inexcusable course of the Russian Minister at Washington rendered it neces sary to ask for his recall, and to decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplo matic representative. It was incompatible with self-respect, or with a j.ist regard to the dignity of the country, to permit M. Cat acazy to hold interviews with this Govern ment after his abuse of Government officials and during his persistent interference. through various means, with the relations be tween the United States and other Powers. In accordance with my wishes, our Govern ment has been relieved of further intercourse with Mr. Catacazv, and the management of the affairs of the Imperial nation has passed. into the nanus of a gentleman entirely unob jectionable. With Japan we continue to maintain inti mate relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado has, since the close of the last session of Office In C'iiiioo'n DuildlnK, over the Pout Office. 

UPPER SANDUSKY, OHIO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER H, 1871. Congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of import mice in several departments of tho Government. I have reason to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the United States have pur sued toward Japan. It is our desire to con tinue to maintain this disinterestedness and just policy with China as well as japan. The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition nn the part of this Government to swerve from its established course. Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked sail ors on the Coran coast, 1 instructed our Minister at Pekin to endeavor to conclude a convention with Corca for securing the safety and humane treatment of such mari ners. Admiral Rogers was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force to protect him In caso of need. A small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast," was treacherously attacked at a disad vantage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation and apology for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed. After an arduous march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts from which the outrages had been committed were gal lantly assaulted, and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vin dicated the honor of the flag, the expedition returned, finding it impracticable, under the circumstances, to conclude the desired con vention. I respectfully refer to the corre spondence relating thereto, herewith sub mitted, and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see lit to take. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable laws establishing what is known as the free zone on the fron tier of the United States. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also more stringent measurvs may be taken by that republic re straining lawless person 9on its frontier. . I hope that Mexico, by its own action, will soon relieve this government of the difficul ties experienced from these causes. Our relations with the various republics of Central and South America continhe, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly. I recommend some action by Congress regard ing the overdue installments under the award of the Venezuela Claims Commission of 1806. The internal dissensions of that government present no justification for the absence of an effort to meet their solemn treaty obliga tions. The ratifications of an extradition treaty j tuu iin-niiimi uute uven exciiangea. It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory steps toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations with that empire, alwavs cordial, will naturally be made more so by this act. It is not too much to hope that the Govern ment of Brazil may hereafter find it for its in terest, as well as intrinsically right, to ad vance toward entire emancipation more rapid ly than the present act contemplates. The true prosperity and greatness of a nation iR to be found in tlie elevation and education of its laborers. It is a subject for regret that the reforms In this direction, which were voluntarily promised by the stutesinen of Spain, have not been carried out in its West Indian colonics. The laws and regulations for the apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba ond Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in bondage, with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to their emplovers. I desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the United States are large holders, in foreign lands, of this species of property, forbidden by the fundamental law of their own country. I recommend to Con gress to provide, by stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against the holding, owning, or dealing in slaves, or being interested in slave property in foreign lands, cither as owners, hirers, or mortgagers, by citizens of the United States. It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the Island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxietv. The existence of a protracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, without apparent prospect of an early ter mination, cannot be other than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the affairs of other pow ers, naturally desires to see every country in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty and the blessings of "free institutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives, and -property of bona .flrle American citizens, and maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growiug out of the affairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and conciliation which has hitherto guided the two powers iu, their treatment of such questions. To give importance to, and to add to the efficiency of, our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and to further in retaining the good opinion of those people, and to se cure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between tliose na tions and the balance of the commercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appro priation be made to support at least four American youths in each of those countries, to serve as a part of the official families of our Ministers there. Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain and some other powers. As now sit uated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of those countries, who know our language imperfectly, or pro cure for the occasion the services of employes in foreign business houses, or the interpreters to other foreign ministers. I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting the American lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and Japan and China, and the Aus tralian line, almost our onlv remaining line of ocean steamers, and of increasing their service. 

POST-OFHCE DEPARTMENT. The enlarged receipts of the Post-Offico. Department, as shown bv the accompanving Report of the Postmaster General, exhibits! a gratifying increase in that branch of the I public service. It is the index of the growth of education and of the prosperity of the people two elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring the services of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this Department can be made self-sustaining ; but a gradual approach to this end, from year to year, is confidently relied upon, and the day . is not far distant when the Post-OtHce Department of the Government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. The suggestions of the Postmaster-General for Improvements in the department presided over by him, are earnestly recom mended to your special attention ; especial ly to the documents favorable to the con sideration of the plan for uniting the tele graph system of the United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced and the service as well, if not better, rendered. It would secure the fur ther advantage of extending the telegraph through portions of the country where pri vate enterprise win not construct it. Com merce, trade, and. above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated into a com munity of interests, are alwavs benefited by a rapid intercommunication. Education, the groundwork of republican institutions, is encouraged by increasing the facilities for gathering speedy news from all parts of the country. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate education. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for full details of the operations of last year, and for comparative statements of the results with former years. THE 

KC-KIXX LAW. There has been imposed upon the Executive branch of the Government the execution of the act of Con gress, approved April 20, 1871, and com monly known as the "Ku-Klux law,' in a portion of the State of South Carolina. The necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the ommittee appointed to investigate the Southern outrages. Under the provisions of the above act, 1 issued a proclamation, call ing the attention of the people of the United States to the same, and declaring my re luctance to exercise any of the extraordina ry powers thereby cimfcrrcd upon me, ex cept in the case of an imperative necessity. but making known my purpose to exercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of secur ing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and the laws. After the passage of this law information was received, from time to time, that com binations of the character referred to iu this law existed, and were powerful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in certain counties in the State of South Caro lina. Careful investigation was made, and it was ascertained that In nine counties of that State such combinations were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local authority, and having, among other things, the object of depriving the emancipated clat of the substantial benefits of freedom and of privi lege, and the free political action of thnc citizens who did Hot sympathize with their own views. Among their operations were frequent scnurglngs and occasional assassina tions, generally perpetrated at night by dis guised persons, the victims, in almost all cases, being citizens of different political sentiments from their own, or freed persons who had shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of Inoffensive and welt- disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless violence. Thereupon, on the Uith of October, 1871, a proclamation was issued, in terms of the law, calling npon the mem bers of the combination to disperse within five days, and to deliver to the Marshal or military officers of the United States all arms, ammunitions, uniforms, disguises, and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful purpose. This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another proclamation was issued, suspending the privilege of the writ of habti corm in nine counties in that State. Direction was given that within the counties so designated persons supposed, upon credible information, to be members of such unlawful combinations, should be arrested by the military forces of the United States, and delivered' to the Marshal, to bo dealt With according to law. In two of the said counties (York and Spartanshurg)many arrests have been made. At last account the number of persons thus arrested was 108. Several hundred, whose criminality was as certained to be of an inferior degree, were released for the present. These have gen erally made confessions of their guilt. Great caution has been exercised in making these arrests. Notwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person is now in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the judicial tribunals of the United States. As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and there is good ground for supposing that all of such persons have been violating the law. A full report of what has been done unuer mis law will be submitted to Congress by the At- torncy -General, THE MORMONS. In Utah there still remains remnant of barbarism repugnant to civilization to decen cy and to the laws of the United States. Ter ritorial officers, however, have been found who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity, and with a due sense of sustaining the majesty of the law. Neither polygamy, nor any other vio lation of existing statutes, will be permitted within the territory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the self-stylrd "saints" that we arc now dealing, but their practices. They will be protected in the worship of God according to the dictates of their consciences, but they will not be per mitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. It may be advisable for Con gress to consider w"hat, in the execution of the laws against polygamy, is to be the sta tus of the plural wives and their offspring. The propriety of Congress passing an en abling act, authorizing the Territorial Leg islature of Utah to legitimatize all children born prior to a time fixed in the act, might be justified by its humanity to these inno cent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation. INIHAN AFFAIRS. 'The policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably, so far as 'can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation. Through the ex ertions of the various societies of Christians to whom has been entrusted the execution of the policy, and the Board of Commis sioners authorized by the law or April 10, 180!), many tribes of Indians have been in duced to settle npon reservations, to cultivate the soil and perform productive labor of va rious kinds, and to partially accept civ ilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination. I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy ,not only because it is humane, Christian-like and economical, but because it is right. I recommend to your favorable con sideration, also, the policy of granting a ter ritorial government to the Indians in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so, every right guaranteed to the Indians by treaty should be secured. Such a course might in time be the means of collecting most of the Indians between the Missouri and Pacific and south of the British Posses sions, into one Territory or one State, and the Secretary of the Interior has treated upon this subject at length ; and I recominenu to you his suggestions. THE PUBLIC LASPS. I renew my recommendations that the pub lie lands be regarded as a heritage to our children, to be disposed of only as required for occupation, and to aetual settlers. Those already granted have been in great part di posed "of in such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them, but caution should be exercised, even in attaining so de sirable an object. Educational interests may well be served bv the grant of the proceeds of the sale of public lands to settlers. I do not wish to be understood as recommendin in the least degree, a curtailment of what is being done by the General Government for the encouragement of education. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, subnuttca w ith this, will give vou informa tion, collected and prepared for publication. in regard to the census taken during the vear 1870; tbe operations of the Bureau of Education for the year; the Patent Office; the Pension Office; the Land Office; and the lnuian Bureau. AGRICULTURE. The report of the Commissioner of Agri culture gives the operation of his depart ment for the year. A agriculture is the ground-work of our prosperity, too much importance cannot be attached to the labors of this department-. It is in the hands of an able head, with able assistants, all zealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the nation all uscfui pro ducts adapted to any of the various climates and soils of our vast Territories, and to giv ing all uscfui Information as to the method of cultivating the plants, cereals, and other products adapted to particular localities. Q,uietlv, but surelv, the Agricultural Bureau is working a great national good, and if lib erally supported, the more widely its in flucnce w ill he extended, and the less de pendent we shall be upon products of for eign countries. COMPENSATION OP CERTAIN OFFICIALS. The sublect of compensation to the heads of bureaus, and officials holding positions of responsibility, and requiring ability ana char acter to fill properly, is one to which yonr at tention is invited. But few of the officials receive a compensation equal to the respecta ble support of a family, while their duties are such as to involve minions oi interest, In private life, services demand coininmsa- tion equal to the services rendered. A wise economy would dictate the same rule in the government service. ESTIMATES. I have not given the estimates for the sup port of the government for the ensuing year, nor a comparative statement for the year just passed, and the one just passing, be cause all these figures are contained in the accompanving report, or in those presented directly to' Congress. These estimates have my approval. REMOVAL OP DISABILITIES. More than six -ears having elapsed since the last hostile gun was tired between the armies then arrayed against each other, the one for the perpetuation ; the other for the destruction, of tbe Union, it may well be considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment should be removed. That amendment does not exclude the ballot, but only requires the disability to hold office of certain classes. When the purity of the bal lot is secure, majorities are sure to elect AfHonra r..Ho.t it, v tlin vifU nf tht, ffifllfiritr I do not see the advantage or propriety of j excluding men from office merely In-caiise nicy were, ociore luc rcucuion, oi sianiiiii and character sufficient to he elected to posi tions requiring them to take an oath to sup port the Constitution ; aud admitting the eligibility of those entertaining precisely the same views, but of It ss standing in "their communities. It may be suid that the former violated au oath, while the latter did not. The latter did not have it in their power to do so. If they had tuken this oath, it can not lie doubted that would have broken it, as did tbe former class. If there are any great criminal distinguished above all others for the part they took In opposition to the government, they might, in the judgment of Congress, be excluded from such an amnesty. This subject is submitted fur your careful consideration. The condition of the Southern Stntis, un happily, not such as all true patrotic citizen would like to see. Sochd ostracism for opin ion's sake, personal violence, or thn-ats to ward persons entertaining political views o )H'd to those entertained by the majority of the citizens, prevent immigration and the "flow of much-nccdcd cnpitul into the States lately in rebellion. It will be a happy condition of the country when the old citizens of these States wili'take an interest in public affairs, promulgate their ideas honestly entertained, vote for men rejirusenting their view, and permit the sitme freedom of expression and ballot in those entertaining different political convictions. ' IMMIGRANTS. The number of immigrants, ignorant of our laws and habits, coming into our conn try annually, has become so great, aud the imposition practiced upon them so numer ous and flagrant, that I suggest Congression al action for their protection. It seems to me a fair subject of legislation by Congress. I cannot now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints made by emigrants of the treatment they receive, bnt will en deavor to do so during tho session of Con gress, particularly if the subject should receive your attention. National finances and taxation. ' Tho national debt has been reduced to the extent ot 8ti,057,rJC.8O during the year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of interest, the interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for interest account is nearly 17,000,000 least han on the 1st of March, 180U. It wa highly desirable that this rapid dimunitiou should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its eitbsens of their entire ability to meet every dollar ot liability without bankrupting them; but in view of "the accom plishment of these desirable ends and the rapid development of the resources ot the country. Its increasing ability to meet tho large demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment. I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal tax laws. I recom mend that all taxes from internal source be abolished, except those on spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its vari ous forms, and from stamps. In readjusting the tariff 1 suggest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue col lected under the present law after providing for the current expenses of the Government, the interest account, and a sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such man ner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articles not produced at home, such as medi cines and compounded essences, from which very little revenue ia derived, hut which en ter into general use. All such articles I rec ommend to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made up on those articles which can bear it without disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American labor. I have not enter ed into figures, becaase to do so would be to repeat all that is laid Itefore you in the re port of the Secretary of the Treasury. collectors op (customs. The present laws for collecting the rev enues pay the Collectors of Customs small salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at tbe principal ports of entry par ticularly, raise the compensation of these officials to a large sum. It has always seem ed to me as if this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out induce ment to dishonest men, should such get possession of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to enanie inem finally to make large seizures. Yonr atten tion is respectfully invited to this subject. 

OOLO AND CTRRENCT. Continued fluctuations in tho value of gold, compared with the national currency, has a most damaging effect upon the in crease and development of the conntry In keeping up prices of all articles necessary in evcry-day life. It foster a spirit of gam bling prejudicial alike to national morals and the national finances. If the question can be met as to how to get a fixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uni formly approaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained. THE ARMT. For the oiierations of the army in the past year, the expense of maintaining it, the estimates for the ensuing year, and for con tinuing sea coast and other improvements conducted under the supervision of the War Department, I refer you to the accompany ing report of the Secretary of War. 1 call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1809, which dis continues promotions in tne stan corps oi ine army until provided for by law. I recom mend that the number of officers in .ich grade of the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number in any one grade falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes vacant, the place may be tilled by selection from the corps In which the vacancy exists. THE NAVT. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force, without materi al increase in the expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which ha been adopted, and is being extended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruiser on the several stations. By these means we have been enabled to oc cupy at once a larger extent of cruising ground, to visit more frequently the posts where the presence of our flag is desirable, and generally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace. Without exceeding the number of men or of expenditures authorized by law, during the past year, the navy has, in addition to its regular service, supplied the men and officer for the vessel of the Coast Survey, and ha completed the surveys authorized by Con gress of the Isthmus of Daricn and Tehnan tepcc, and, under like authority, has cnt out an expedition, completely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the North. The suggestion of the report as to the necessity for increasing and im proving the material of the navy, and the plan recommended for reducing the pcrsonnc of the service to a peace standard, by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the employment of soma in the service of the commercial marine, arc well considered and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress. I also recommend that all pro motions in the navy above the rank of Cap tain be by selection Instead of by seniority. This course will se cure, in the higher grade, greater cffieicncy.and hold out an incentive to young officer to improve themselves In the knowledge of their profession. The preocnt cost of maintaining the navy, its cost comjiared with that of the preceding year, and the estimate for the ensuing year, ire contained in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. It has been the aim of the Administration to enforce honesty and efficiency in all public office. Every public servant who ba violated the trust plueed in him has liecn proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. If bod men have secured place, it ha been the fault of the system established by law and custom for making appointments, or the fault of those who recommend for Government positions person not sufficiently well known to them personally, or who give letters in dorsing tbe character of office-seekers, with out a pnier sense of the grave responsibil ities which such a course devolve upon them. A Civil Service Reform which can cor rect this abuse is much desired. In mercan tile pursuit the busines man who gives a letter of recommendation to a.fricnd to en able him to obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded a morally responsible for the integ rity of his friend, a'nd hi ability to meet hi obligations. A reformation which would en force this principle against all indorsem of persons for public phu-v, would insure great rnuti u in making recommendations. A !- ularv lesson has lecn taught the rarclcs anl iiim n-sn un.-. .., - the aishonest .rvunt in the great mimlH-rof prosecutions and convictions of the la-t two Vear. It i gratifying to notice the "f,.v,.i-,,bl.. ilninL'u which I takui iriinr . throughtiut the country in imr to punishment those ". . 1 . . . . , ,r..i.wi have proved recreant to tht K'a.,t them, aim m eievaiuiB iu bill tllOSe Who poSSC lUO nraminnr w lur honest and virtuous, who, it w ill alway be found, comprise the majority of the couuiiuu itv iu which tliev live. In my mcsage to Congress, onu vear ago, 1 urgently recom mended a reforin in the civil service of tbe country. In conformity with that recoinmen- TERMS: per Annum. NO. 5. dation. Congress, in the ninth section or an act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government and for" other purposes, approved March 3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the Executive to inau gurate a civil service reform, and placed np on him the resnsibility of doing so. tinder the authority of said act", I convened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified for the work, to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labors are not vet romplcted, bnt it is believed that they will succeed in devising a plan which can be adopted to the great relief of the Executive, the heads of Department and member of Congress, and which will redound to the true interest of the public service. At all events, tbe experiment shall have a fair trial. DISTRICT OP COLUMBIA. Under the provision of the act of Con gress, approved February 21, 1871, a Terri torial Government wa organized in the Dis trict of Columbia. It result have thus far fully realized tbe expectations of ha advo cates. Under the direction of the territorisl officers, a system of improvements has been Inaugurated, by means of which Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the na tional capital. The citizens of the district having voluntarily taxed thcmselve to a large amount for the purpose of contributing to the advancement of the scat of Government, I recommend liberal appro priations on the part of Congress in order that the Government may bear it just share of the expense of carrying out the various system of improvement. GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN CHICAGO. By the great fire in Chicago, the most im portant ef the Government buildings in that city were consumed. Those burned had al ready become inadequate to the wants of the Government in that growing city, and, look ing to the near future, were totally inade quate. I recommend, therefore, that an ap propriation be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the square on which tho burned buildings stood, provided it can he purchased at a fair valuation, and provided the Legislature of Illinois w ill pass a law au thorizing its condemnation for Government purposes, and also an appropriation of as much money as can properly be expended towards the erection of new buildings during this fiscal year. CONCLUSION. I have thus hastily summed up the opera tions of the Government during the last year, and made such suggestions as occurs to me to be proper for your consideration. I submit them, with a confidence that vour combined action will be wise, statesmanlike and in the beat interest of the whole country. U. 8. GRANT, President, Execcttvb Mansion. December 4 1871. REFOKT OP THE SECRETARY THE TREASURY. OF The following i a synopsis of the annnal report of Geo. S. Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury: the public debt. During the fiscal year ending June SO, 1871, the reduction of the public debt was $!W.:S7,704.X4. The total decrease in the Itublic debt from March 1, 18i9, to December , 1871, was tJ7,211,8n3.16, aud during the same period, the annual interest ha been reduced 16,741,W.04. A 

REDUCTION OP TAXES. The revenues for the year 1801, and the re ceipt since 1st of June last, show that the time has arrived when a considerable further reduction in taxes can be made, and yet leave the government in a position to pay r 50.00(1, 000 annually of the principal of tbe debt, in cluding the amount pledged through the sinking fund. THE REVENUE POLICT. The Secretary still adheres to his formerly expressed opinion that the settled policy of the country should contemplate a revenue sufficient to meet the ordinary expenses of the government, pay tbe interest upon the public debt, and from twenty-five to fifty million of dollars of the principal annually. He think the annual payment on the prin cipal of tbe public debt should not be less than fifty millions, arguing that, large as the revenues of tbe country have been dur ing the last three year, our system of taxa tion ha not been oppressive to individuals; nor has it in any sensible degree embarrassed the business of the country, and, while re lief from taxation is desirable, it is yet more desirable to maintain tbe public credit in its present elevated position, not only as an ex ample to other nation, butYor its historical value in enabling the government to make loans for large amounts upon favorable terms, if unhappily In the future an exigen cy should require such loans to be made. 

REVENUE RECEIPTS. The revenue from customs for the year 1S71 wa greatly n excess of the estimates. amounting to r-300.270. 408.05 against 5oS.874.44 for the preceding year. The cost of collecting this revenue was to,56t).672,01 for 1871, being three and eleven-hundredths percent., while the cost for the year 1870 was $G,2o7,137 25, or three and twanty-hundredths per cent. The probabilities are that the cus toms revenue for the current vear will exceed that for the years 1870and 1871. The receipts from internal revenue were $143,098,153.63, be ing (4.048.984.29 less than the estimate pre sented to Congress in December last for the fiscal year to June 30, 1871. The estimate for tbe enrrent fiscal vear were H2tJ.418.000. and it is probable that the receipts will tie equal to the estimates. The net receipts for the fiscal vear ending June an, isil, were From enstoms. FJl.270.408.Oo ; internal rev enue, (143.008,153.63 ; sales of public lands. K,s8,n4o.o9 ; misccllaneon sonrces, wi Ot'rfi.730.53 making a total of $3SA823,944.M Tho exiH-nditures were : For civil and mis cellaneous purposes, diO. 478,7 10.517 ; war debt. t44,080,084.0 ; Navy Department, $19, 431,027.21 ; Indians, (7,420,997.44 ; pension. CH. 444.894.83 : interest on public debt, i:sv 670,505.93 making a total (less (8,280,092.12 repaid into the Treasury as proceeds of sales from ordnance, etc.) of (292,178.189.21. The estimated receipts for the remaining three-quarter of the current fiscal vear arc (258,000,000; expenditure. (209,500,000 showing a balance applicable to the pay ment of the principal of the public debt for the fiscal year ending June 31 1872, of 71, 794.991.081 The estimated receipt for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1873, are (350,00O,0uO; ex penditures, (301,705,030.99. At the same time the Secretary make calculation for a reduction in the revenue from custom of (20.000,01 , and from internal -source of (10,000,000. He recommends to the consid eration of Congress the reduction of the du ties on salt to the extent of 50 per cent.; the duty on bituminous coal to 50 cent per ton; the reduction of the duty on raw hides and skins, and the removal of all duties from a class of articles in other countries which en ter into the art aud manufacture of this eountry, and which are not produced in the United" States, and the revenue from which is inconsiderable. Such a list, with the rev enue derived from each article, is in course of preparation, and will be submitted to Congress. THE CURRENCY. The average premium on gold for the vear 184S was 39.54 per cent. ; for the year 1809 U was 32.56 per cent, premium; for the year 1810 it was 14.83 per cent, premium ; and for the first eleven months of the year 1871. it was 12.1 per cent, premium. The value of tho paper currency of the conntry during the years 18 and 1870. wa apparently appreci ated bv the increased use of paper money in the South, but chiefly by the. establishment of tbe credit of the I'nited Slate upon a uni form basis. On the 1st of January, 1871, the last-named fact was fully accomplished, and since that time the appreciation of the paper currency has been doe wholly to the increas ed demand for it in the business affairs of the conntry. One " hundred and forty-five hanks have been organized under the "act approved July ' 12. 1871, providing for the issue of fifty-four millions of dollars of additional bank circu lation, and the sum of (22,333,910 has been issued. Bv virtue of tbe act the Treasury has redeemed (22,230,000 of the 3 per cent, certificates then in circulation, leaving the sum of (23,490.000 now outstanding. The Secretary suggests that It appears to him to be wise to leave the distribution of the cir culation authorized by aid act a it now stands. Although some effort have been made at counterfeiting, the peculiar paper has rendered their effort unsuccessful, and , Anerin j ,c I " (' ' specimen captured are crude as not to c fecnoil appreucnsion as m uminaic s-ince the first oi jury, ixot. seventy ' "f which have been accounted for on the ! tmoks of the Department. The Secretary re. omnienus mm an nri f,.r a new issue ot N re.-ommends that an appropriation be made new Issue of atincl uanK note. i tu Those now iu use are much worn, aud very successful counterfeits of several denomina tion have apeared. REVENUE StIZURPS. The Secretary calls the attention of Con gress to the importance of abolishing the system of thare in rooictie, as far as it ef- feet revenue officers and other persons offl cUlly connected with the government, INTERNAL COMMERCE. It is estimated that the internal commerce -of tbe country is fifteen times as great as our external commerce, bnt the statistics are not trustworthy or complete, and I re spectfully recommend that a provision be made for obtaining such returns as will show fully the trade of the country npon its rivers, canals, lake and railways. . ,; THE SEAL FISHERIES. ' v." The report of Mr. Cha. Bryant, ' speciaC agent, who has charge of the fur seal fish eries at the islands of St. Paul and St. George, shows that the business, has bwi conducted by the Alaska Commercial Com-., pany, in substantial conformity to th terms of the contract. . . . SALARIED. The Secretary again call the attention of Congress to the importance, of increasing the salaries of the- bureau officers and heads of divisions in the Treasury Department, great inequality and injustice at present ex isting. , t ' ' V COMPETmVEZXAMINjlTfONS.. ' . The examination of person designated for clerical service, and for promotion in tbe Treasury Department, have been continued with beneficial results, and the examination is even more exacting in requirement than . at the date of the last annnal report. Means will be taken to extend the system, with such modifications a the difference of tbe duties may suggest, but with equal efficien cy, if possible, to the principal Custom lionses, and to other branches of the public service under control of this Department THE
