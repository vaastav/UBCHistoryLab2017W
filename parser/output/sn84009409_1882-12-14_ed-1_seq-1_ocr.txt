The Altoona Time* wants the navy sold.aud the Philadelphia Time wants the Altoona Times to first catch the navy before putting it up at auction. GOVERNOR-ELECT PATTISON, visit ed the Slate Capitol on Saturday had nn interview with Governor Hoytand dined with him at Ruse' Grand Hotel. PRESIDENT ARTHUR'S reference to the Hayes administration when he speaks of it ns "the four years preoed iug Mr. Garfield's accession," is the eloquence of sarcasm. THE Slate of Georgia, it is said, has 3,593 manufacturing establishments with u capital of 820,672,410, and gives employment to 25,000 persons, meo, womeu ami children. THE National Hank of the State of N. Y. has decided to enter the State Bauking System, and it is said it is likely to be followed by a uuniber of other bauking institutions. THE post-office ill L ai-burg was burglarized last week. The thieves blew opeu the safe and secured alxiut nine hundred dollars in mouey and all the registered letters. THE leading question now is, has Senator Cameron yet selected his next candidate for governor, or will he wait until the next National Convention ? ! Field Marshal Cooper might answer. ii. .. . _ 

MANY p?r-o IS failed to see Madam Venus skipping over the sun the other day, hut they may have better luek the ; next time she performs. It will only ' he 122 years until the next truiisit i is to take place. SENATOR LOGAN again reiterates his undying hostility to the restoration ! of General Fitz John Porter. Noth ing better could lie expected of a man incapable of a generous emotion that might possibly conflict with his politi cal prejudice. THE receipts into the State Treasury during the year ending the 30th of November, (including a new loan of $9,360,120.45) is $16,428,650.11. The paymeuts for the same (teriod, (includ ing two loans redeemed $9,826,104.77,) is $14,850,871.18. IT is said Don Cameron has trier! his digestive organs on the first dish of Crow by consenting to the confirma tion of Marshall M'Michacl. He has a good deal of that kind of diet to dispose of before his re-election, and it is well to accustom his stomach to the fare. THERE seems to be a general con currence among Senators and Repre sentatives that a revision of the tariff laws is absolutely necessary at the present session. The same necessity has existed for some time but it has become more apparent to sluggish : states men since the election. ■ THE Presidcut favors the reduction of letter postage to two cents. This proportion is favorably received throughout the country. Hut it is suggested that a turn might also be taken at newspaper postage. News paper readers, too, might be givea a chance iu the reduction with great propriety. . 

TIIE Clinton Ii publican and other stalwart (taper*, say* that the Demo cratic State officials were committed to civil service reform, end they will be held responsible for their promises. That is right, let the people put them to a strict accountability. That is what is expected. But does not the Republican demand imply that reform is much needed, and the discharge of all corrupt persons in the puhlio ser vice who have bad any agency iu aid ing the general debauchery of electionc, is a very proper place to Degin the desired reforhi 7 TARIFF REFORM. In advance of the publication of the report of the Commission appoint* ed to examine ami report on the con dition of our tariff, it may not be wise to declare what ought to be done by Congress. That report was made a few days ago, but neither the members nor the public have been able to read and digest its suggestions. Enough is known however, about the report, that very important changes are recom mended by the Commission. This is right. Our tarilf was made during the war for the purpose of securing as large a revenue as possible. To do this, Congress placed the tarilf rates on those articles most extensively used throughout the country. These inclu ded mostly articles of necessity. In the distribution of this tarilF, the arti cles of prime necessity, such as cheap blankets, bought by the poor, etc., I were more heavily taxed than the the better quality. The wind hat of the better manufacture paid less tariff the cheap kind. For instance, dia monds pay ten per cent.; blankets pay 70 to 100 per cent. —highest priced ones 70 per cent., a low priced one 08 per cent. ; balmorals 00 per cent, if high priced, 85 |>er cent, if low pric ed ; flanuels, worth not over 40 cents a pound, pay 05 jar cent, if over ><o cents, 01 per cent.; hats not over 80 cents, 66 per cent.; over, 09 j>er cent. So as to cotton and carpets and other woolen goods. Plows and all farming and mechanic tools of steel, aic 45 per cent. Thus it will be seen that ibis War Tariff was made to produce large amounts of revenue that is no longer needed except for River and Harbor steals. The revenue is ample, it exceeds the cx|>eodiiurea of the government $liK),000.000. This being admitted, let the tariff be wholly re moved ou such articles as are not man ufactured in the country. To tax an article for revenue when that revenue re not required, is simple robbery. A* to articles manufactured here and us ed by our people let there be a gcuer- : al reduction iu the interest of the |>eo- - pie, at the same lime having due res- j pect for the interest of invested capi- i tal and employed labor. Bucb is the drift of public sentiment. The days > of high protection are few. Tariff at best,is simply taxation, and when it is levied for any purpose other than to provide revenue to support the Gov ernment, may properly characterized a tax of the many for the benefit of the few. When the principle of dis crimination on plea of encouragement to home industry was iustitituted, was not with a view that it was to reach out to perpetual oppression. Hut what was encouragement at first, came to be considered a matter of right. Whenever the business of special clas ses became dull, more tariff was aked from Congress. Tho steel men filially secured S2B per ton ou steel rails, and the profit became so high that manu facturers of steel rails multiplied at a rapid rate. The competition became j so great that steel rails sold at S4O per ton,some S2O cheaper than the foreign er can sell the ra.l* in our market with the tariff off. Let the whole tariff b® revised in the interest of fair and hon orable dealing between the manufact urers and the public. The Commission although strongly organized in behalf of protection, yield to the force of public sentiment and urge a general reduction along the entire line. CONSIDERING the frequency with which the White House has to be re paired and re-furnished, the New York Mar thinks the occupants of that man •ion of late years know precious little alxiut housekeeping and are anything but dead. It was done all over when Arthur look it, tliough it bod only just been put in order when Garfield was wounded. Now it i iu the agonies of another refurnishing. Perhaps the plethoric treasury and the necessity to furnish uatroiiage to some impecunious stalwart -vorkers and dealers, may ae c .unt tor the frequency complained of. "EQUAL ANIJ EEAUT JUSTICE TO ALL MEN, OS WHATKVKII STATE OK EKKSUAHION, RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL.Jrff.r*oii. BELLKFONTE, PA., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1882. THE discussion of political propriety between the Philadelphia Time* aud Clearfield Republican i* quite inter esting, and perhaps instructive, hut we doubt very much whether it is worth the powder for the purpose intended* If it is designed to influence Senator Wallace, either journal might know that the Senator is sharp enough and independent enough to take iu the full measure of the situation, aud perform his duty intelligently without the dic tation of an organ or the menace of an Independent. If Mr. Wallace, as a minority member of the Seuate, be lieves that the public interests can be best advanced, aud a fair representa tion best attained by casting his vote for uuy particular Senator for Presi dent of the Semite, whether he be an Independent or a Democrat, we have uo doubt his choice will fall upon that | man without instruction from any quarter. The creditable record made by Mr. Stewart and the Independents generally in favor of reform measures aud honest legislation, entitle them to very high respect, and from whom the Democracy have every reason to ex pect fair play, at least. If the Demo cratic members believe that by the election of Mr. Stewart these desirable ends can lie best attained, we see no reason why his election should not have their concurrence. They neither forfeit their party respect nor their self respect by choosing the Ir-.11 they can obtain iu the interest of fairness and justice. We doubt, however, whether Mr. Stewart, under the cir cumstances, craves the prominence it would give him and take the responsi bility it would bring. His faction is largely in the minority —they are en tirely independent of party trammels, aud it may occur to them that they can more effectually subserve the ends ! of their indc|M-ndent organization by 1 pla-ing the Senate more directly in accord with the House and the admin istration, and let the responsibility of securing the reforms demanded and urged by IxV.h the Indc|>ei>deuts and Democrats, in precise words, rest upon the Democrats without diversion. But however this may tie, to accomplish the desirable reforms demanded by the people and so urgently conteuded for by both, there should be no want of accord between the Democratic aud Independent Senators oh State issues. Who is to occupy the chair, whether a . Democrat or an Independent, is a small matter if he is in full sympathy j with the economy and reform so em phatically emphasized hy the people iu the late election. SENATOR BECK has introduced a resolution in the Senate looking u> the i investigation of Jay Hubbellism. The resolution calls for light on the manner of assessments, the amount obtained, how disbursed and what sum still re mains in the hands of the collecting thieves that ought to be returned to the robbed employes of the goven - inent. To offset this Senator Hale offers an amendtneot to go into a gen eral search to ascertain where tho 1 Democracy got funds for campaign purposes; but as the Democracy did not go the pages, the scrub-women, the i clerks and other employes of the Gov i ernroeot with threats aod intimidation, | Mr. Hale's amendment is feeble. In the meantime, it appears Huhbell's Chief assistant has disappeared with the books and memoranda of the Committee ae a precautionary measure iu ease the investigation is ordered. THE Adjutant General of Pennsyl vania receives nn annual salary of twenty-five hundred dollars, with a train of subordinates under compara tive pay. This is apparently a depart ment oiganisaiion of reoent date, and in the inquiry which is likely to occur as to the propriety of weeding out sin ecures imposed upon the State re sources, should not be overlooked. Toe expenditures of that Department look ieaky. It may be all right, but judicious inquiry can do no harm. THE President and the Tariff Com mi-hion are free-traders according to the interpretation put by the Republi cans upon the utterances of the Dem ocrats in the late campaign. They both favor a tariff for revenue with incidental protection iu favor of re warding labor, aud not a tariff for protection only. THE Washington Pott, out of pure sympathy for disgruntled Republicans u their desperaliou to find an availa ble candidate for President, now that Hlaine decline to serve them, kindly suggests that they freeze to Kx-Gover- I nor Hayes. He being the only man capable of reaching the Presidency in spite of defeat at the polls, seems to be the only one available to meet the j desperation of the situation. 

ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER has written nn opinion to the effect that the Governor has no power to n*tore to citizenship a person who has lost the franchise by reason of conviction for violating the election laws. He is forever disfranchised, and it is just and proper that he should be. A man who will not respect the most sacred right of citizenship, is not fit to exercise thai right. No wonder that Dr. Bliss and the other physicians and surgeons who at tended the late assassinated President are somewhat disgruntled and disap pointed. They claimed, for the three i principles, the sum of $.5,000 each, for a few weeks'service. The Audit ing committee appointed to distribute the appropriation, have awarded them ' sums averaging from $6,000 to $.'1,000 ; ea h, and public opinion and common | honesty will approve its sufficiency. THE last rumor has it that Secretary ; Folgcr is about to step down and out of the Treasury Department for Don , Cameron to step in. Whpre this n* liable programme comes from, we are , not able to say, hut we presume it is only a sensational feeler to find out how the squelched boa* of the Penn sylvania Republicans would be re ceives! as a leading spirit in Arthur's cabinet. 

SPEAKINO of the asseftsinents of the Government employes in making up the corruption election fund, the Prcs ident says in his message that their j ' only motive in giving was fear of what might befall them if they refus ed." That's it, and yet the robbing was allowed in the Departments under 1 his control, to greater extent, perhaps, than ever before, in the face of a law intended for their protection. Hub bell, Mahooc, Cameron and their satellites, had a free run in the late campaign. WE see it stated that our excellent friend, Major E. MOCONKKT, will be presented for resident clerk of tiie House of Iteprcseutali voa. He served in that office most acceptably iu the session of 1875-76, and we trust be may be choseu now. His ability and experience, as well as his pleasant and gentlemanly bearing, will commend bim a* peculiarly the man for the place iu a Democratic I>egi*lature. GEN. 

MANNING, who contested fr re-election to Congress from Mississip pi against Chalmers; was offered the certificate of election, ou.account of defective returns for the loiter front oue county where the vote was cast for " Chaliuess," declines the certificate and will rest his claims to the seat on the evidence which may lie developed in (he contest before Congress. This evidence promises to lie of a very pas* itive character and is likely to im. j plicate the Administration in very discreditable work, in wuivi. HuhbcH's I corruption committee also plays a part. The course of General Manning in declining the certificate is highly commendable and contrasts fav orably with that of aeveral Republi cans who have received certificates nd will cr in oeaU on alleged dofto* | tiv# MUi.ua oi ieaa merit. Tin: revival of the "Whig" party is seriously spoken of now an a substi tute for the one which aupcrceded it a few yearn ago, ami now in turn in go ing out in ding race. What's in a name? Whether Federalist, Anti Ma sinic, Know Nothing, Whig or Itc* publican, the same crew tnaua it —the name principles govern it —the same disgrace await* it, and the name desti ny follows. Antagonistic mainly to the Democratic principles of Republi can government, it favors the concen tration of power in the Federal Exec* utive and thus teaches by precept and example the subordination of the masses to the personal mastery of the servant. Thus it has ever been under all the names assumed and thus it will be under whatever alias expediency may suggest. Hut the Democracy, the parly of the people, the representative of the masses, founded as the defender of their sovereignty, and unchangeable in the assertion of the right of the people to govern and control, will ever come to the front to protect our Dem ocratic government from the spoliation of the enemy at the right moment. It is here now, and the enemy, covered with fraud and shameless disregard ot the most sacred safeguards of the con stitution and laws of the government, are again seeking a change of name to cover the iniquities of the past and hide the disgrace and usurpations which have marked its progress under the present name. Under this name, among other wrongs, it has usurped the Presidential office by fraud and sought to corrupt and degrade our elections to mere mob-, controlled by rings ami operated by executive pat ronage and fed by spoils forced from the slavish f-ars of the subordinate em ployes of the government. It is time to bide under a new name. " Every intelligent, honest man," says the New York .S'ua in its remarks on the President's message, " must feel an insticlive hatred for the electoral fraud of 1H7d~7, by which the Presi* deocy of the United States was stolen ; and also an instinctive repugnance for the hypocrites and villians who com mitted and promoted the fraud, and who in various official places and dis tinctions enjoyed the direct usufruct thereof. The honorable feeling of hatred and repugnance is beautifully expressed by President Arthur when he describes the shameful period of fraud triumphant, as "the four veers immediately preceding Mr. Garfield's accession to the Presidency." No one can allege that Chester A. Arthur hns pardoned or condoned the blackest ; crime ever perpetrnted by nefarious politicians.

The "road agent" or the l-old high wayman, who collecla his assessments at the muttle of a cocked revolver, re lies on ptwi-isely the same motive that is described ,by the S'alwart President in his official capacity. When the passengers of a car or mail coach, or benighted traveler* on a lonely road, hand over their pocket books to a robber, "their only motive i lor giving is tie tear of what may befall [ them if thry refuted."

How to Obtain a Needed Amendment. Senator Morgan, of Alabama, has in troduced a joint resolution providing for an amendment to the Constitution em powering the President to veto *eparat item* in an appropriation hill while ap proving a portion of the same. This provision exists in the Constitution of tint Ntate, and indeed of several others including New York. It has been found to work well. If engrafted into the Federal Constitution it would afford i he best possible safeguard against log rolling scheme* of plunder. But as it will require a two third vole ' of the very members of Congress who usually profit by log rolling to pass Sen ator Morgan's resolution and allow the A talc* Legislature* to act upon it, there doe* not appear IO be brightest prospect II the world of its success.
