PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. Promptly at noon on the 7th, Gen. Mc Cook, secretary ot the senate, called the body to order and prayer was offered by the chaplnin, ttev. Mr. Huntly, after which Mr. Edmunds offered a resolution declaring John Sherman the president pru te:n ofths eeimte. Mr. Voorhees moved to amend, to strike out the name of John Sherman and insert instead the name of Isham Harris. Tlie amendment was voted down by a party vote—yeas 29, nays 34, and Slier man was without division declared duly elected president pro tem. Mr. Sherman and Mr. Harris both ab­ stained from voting. Upon the request of Secretary McCook Mr. Sherman was escorted to the chair by Edmunds and Voorhees and the oath of ofiice was administered to him by Ed­ munds. Mr. Cullom presented the credentials of Mr. Logan's re-eJection as senator from Illinois, and Mr. Pike presented those of Mr. Blair from New Hampshire. The credentials were received, and Messrs. Logan and Blair were at once sworn in by the president. Noon (ljA o'clock) wag fixed as the hour of daily meeting unless otherwise ordered. The secretary was instructed to inform the president of the United States and the house of representatives that the senate had chosen John Sherman as president pro tem no re. Mr. Voorhees offered the resolutions rv gardin^' the death of Mr. Hendricks, pre­ facing thorn with the remark that in doing BO he was performing the sadest duty of his public life. Mr. Harrison then moved an immediate adjournment of the senate, "out of respect to the memory of the late vice president." At precisely noon the house was called to order by .1. B. Clark, its clerk. When order was secured the clerk pro­ ceeded to call the roll of members-elect. While the roll was in progress a page en­ tered with a huge floral design, represent­ ing a section of a canal navigated by a canal boat laden with diminutive bags of grain,the whole being inscribed "Hennepin." As lie placed it on the desk of Mr. Mur­ phy (Iowa), the especial champion ot the Hennepin canal project, the house broke out into applause and laughter. The call disclosed the presence of 300 members, the only absentees being Miller (N. Y.(, Henderson (N. €'.), Aiken (S. C.), Page (Texas), and Croxston (Va.) Nominations for speaker were then in or­ der, and Mr. Tucker was recognized, who presented the name of John Oriliin Carlisle (Ky.) Messrs. Hiscock and Cannon then rose, but the latter was recognized, and he placed the name of Thomas B. Reed, (Me.) in nom­ ination. Messrs. Morrison, Tucker, Hiscock, and Brown (Ind.) were appointed tellers to count the vote. The result was announced as follows: For Carlisle, 177 for Reed, 137 and aniid loud applause the clerk declared Mr. Carlisle elected, and appointed Messrs. Tucker and Reed as a committee to conduct the speaker to the chair. On taking the chair Mr. Carlisle made a short ndtiruss. The members were then sworn in and pro­ ceeded to draw for scats. Resolutions in regard to Vice President Hendricks were passed and the House ad­ journed. SENATE—After the reading of the presi­ dent's message, the presentation of the re­ port of the secretary of the treasury and business of minor importance, the fol­ lowing bills were introduced: A presi­ dential succession bill a bankruptcy bill to construct a railroad and tele­ graph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean regulating the count of votes for president lixing the salaries ol judges of United States district courts at $5, 000 for the admission of Idaho as a state allotting lands in severalty to Indians to eecurc the relinquishment by the Sioux of title to their reservation* for the construc­ tion of tlio Hennepin canal to repeal the pre-emption, timber culture and desert laud laws restoring some of the Northern Pacif­ ic lands to the United States for the ad misseion of Washington Territory into the Union to provide a permanent reservation for thclndians in Northern Montana to forfeit lands granted to Iowa to aid in the construction of railways for a national board of education Jor the retirement ol the trade dollar. A resolution vai introduced opposing tariff reduction. HOUSE.—Nothing worthy of note was done, the time being occupied by the read­ ing of the president's message. SENATE.—Bills were introduced for the deposit in the treasury of the receipts of the money order system and for the payment of its expenses out of appropriations to secure cheaper telegraphic correspondence to prevent the diffusion of contagious dis­ eases for (he readjustment of the compen­ sation of fourth-class postmasters by Mr. McMillan for the relief of Minnesota swamp land -settlers. A joint resolution was introduced for the extension of suffrage to women. Resolutions were adopted culling upon the postmaster general for information concerning the operations of Chairman Brown, of the Maine Democratic state committee, who is charged with having received money for procuring the appoint­ ment of postmasters, and calling upon the president for the correspondence with Italy and Austria, respecting Minister Keiley. The Viill introduced in the senato by Mr. Van Wyck, providing for the taxation of unpatented lands owned by railroad com­ panies, requires such companies to pay the cost of surveying and locating lands within sixty da.vn after the passage of this act,or, that in default thereof, the lands shall be subject to entry under the homestead and pre-emption laws, and liable to taxation. HOUSE—Mr. Springer offered his revised code of rules for the government ot the house. After a long debate, a resolution that until rules were adopted the house be guided by Jefferson's Manual, as modified by the parliamentary practice of the house of representatives, was adopted. The speaker appointed a committee on rules. SENATE—Bills were introduced to repeal the act providing for the settlement ol claims of officers and soldiers for private property destroyed to relieve commer­ cial travelers from license taxes for the establishment of an internatioual tribunal to settle all disputes among nations to establish postal telegraph to open the Oklahoma lands to settlement to reimburse the depositors of the Freedman's Saving and Trust company for losses making an additional article of war pro­ hibiting and punishing gambling in the army repealing the statute of limit­ ations on the allowance of pension arrears. Senator Piatt's bill makes it a misde­ meanor for any officer of the state or a municipal corporation to interfere, in any way, with commercial traveler selling goods in a state in which he or the mer­ chants he represents, is not a citizen. Senator Plumb's bill to improve the effi­ ciency of the militia authorizes the secre­ tary of war, on the application of any state or territory, to recall unserviceable ordinance or ordinance stores issued to the militia, and to replace them with the kinds tupplied to the regular army. Senator Plumb's bill making another article of war provides: Anny officers serving with troops, or any soldier not on furlough, who gambles, or «ny officer of the army whether or not serv­ ing with troops also by gambling shall win money from an inferior officer, shall be court-martialed, and that any post trader who permits gambling in his establishment shall have his appointment revoked, and it makes it the duty of everjr commanding officer to enforce the provisions of the act.

PERSONAL, CARD. A-Matter in Which the Puollc Should Have Deal ot Inter««t To the readers of this paper. Why does the government spend so much money and risk so many lives in trying to capture the counterfeiter? "Suppose he does counterfeit gov­ ernment bonds and notes, surely the government is rich enough to stand any loss his act may confer!" But the individual citizen could ill afford to be put to continued financial loss if such desperados were let go un whipped of justice. It is only the valuable thing that is counterfeited it is only in the light of purity and virtue that impurity and vice can be known. No one in these days would counterfeit a Confederate bond or note. People who commit fraud always do it by simulating the highest virt|ie by preying 011 the cleanest reputation, by employing the fair name ot virtue with which to give respectability to vice. Let us explain: Seven or eight years ago, so we have been informed many times in public prints, a New York state gentleman was pronounced, as many millions have been pronounced before, incurably sick of an extreme disorder. By suggestions which he believed were providential, he was led to the use of a preparation which had been for sev­ eral years employed by a select few physicians in New York city, and one or two other prominent places. The result was that lie was cured,he whom doctors without number and of con­ ceded ability said was incurable. Hav­ ing secured possession of the formula, absolutely and irrevocably, he deter­ mined to devote a portion of his ac­ cumulated wealth to the manufacture and sale of this remedy for the benefit of the many who suffer as he suffered, in apparent hopelessness. In less than three years,so tremendous became the demand for this remedy and so exalted the reputation, that he was obliged for his purpose to erect a laboratory and warehouse containing four and a quarter acres of flooring and filled with the most approved chemical and man facturing devices. Probably there nev­ er was a remedy that has won such a meritorious name, such extraordinary sales, and has accomplished so much good for the race. Unprincipled parties who flourish only upon the ruins of others, saw in this reputation and sale an opportu­ nity to reap a golden harvest, (not legitimately, not honorably) for which purpose they have made imitations and substitutions of it in every sec­ tion of the country, and many drug­ gists, who can make a larger profit on these imitationgoods, often comprom­ ise their honor by forcing a sale upon the unposted customer. Yes undoubtedly the manufacturers could well afford to ignore such in­ stances of fraud so far as the effect upon themselves is concerned, for their remedies have a constant and unremitting sale but tliey feel it to be their duty to warn tl»e public against such imitations and substitutions non-secret and otherwise. The indi­ vidual who buys them and the public who countenances their sale alone suffer in mind, body and estate there­ for. The authors of some of these fraudu­ lent practices have been prosecuted and sent to prison for their crimes, but their is another class who claim to know the formula of this remedy and one Sunday scool journal, we are told, has prostituted its high and holy calling so far as to advertise that for twenty-five cents it will send all new subscribers a transcript of the Warner formula! This formula, by the way, must be a wonderfuly kaleidoscopic affair, for there is hardly a month passes when some paper is not issued which pretends to give the only cor­ rect formula! The manufacturers inform us that they would be perfectly willing that the public should know what the true formula o! Warner's Safe Cure is, (none that have been published are any­ thing like it), but even if every man, woman and child in the United States were as familiar with this formula as with their A C's they could not compound the remedy. The method of manufacture is a secret. It is im­ possible to obtain the results that are wrought by this remedy if one does not have the perfect skill acquir­ ed only by years of practice, for com­ pounding and assimilating the simple elements which enter into its compo­ sition. The learned Dr. Foster, the honored head of Clifton Springs sanitarium, once said that having roughly an­ alyzed this remedy he recognized that the elements that compose it were simple but he attributed the secret of its power to the method of its com­ pounding, and this method no one knows except the manufacturers and no one can acquire it. Our advice to our readers, therefore, cannot be to strongly emphasized. As you would prefer virtue to vice, gold to dross, physical happiness to physical misery, shun the imitator and refuse thereby to lend yonr aid financially to those who seek to get, by trading upon another's reputation and honesty, a sale for wares and goods which on their merits are fit only to be rejected as the veriest re­ fuse. You can neither afford to pat­ ronize such people nor can you afford to take their injurious compounds in­ to your system. When you call for Warner's Safe Cure see that the wrap­ per is black with white letters and that the wrapper and label bear an imprint of an iron safe, the trade mark, and that a safe is blown in the back of the bottle and that a perfect lc promniisory note stamp is over the cork. You can't be imposed on if you observe these cautions. We have the highest respect for the remedy we have mentioned and the highest regard for the manufactures, and we cannot to highly commend their dignified and considerate tone in relation to those who would traduce their fair name and ruin the best in­ terest of the public in such matters. Athlophoros always gives me relief from rheumatism, and I am not troubled again with the complaint, for months. A little exposure brings it back again, but not as severely as before using your remedy. Wm. H. Sonle, Castle Rock, Minn. FOR SICK HEADACHE TAKE ALLEN'S Iron Tonic Bitters.

It is an astonishing thingto observe the style which New York men are oc­ casionally able to put on by dint of stretching out an income which is ab­ surdly small. Small clerks, with sal­ aries of twelve dollars a week, pay seven dollars of it for their board, two dollars for their washing, at least two dollars for their car fares and luncheons, and yet manage to wear fashionable clothes. Some of these well-dressed but impecunious young men possess an amount of in­ formation about clothes, boots, hats, and the like that astonishes men who devote their time and thinl cing to graver thjngs, and even equals that of the feminine dresser. They will go five miles up town and patronize a little shoemaker in aside street, because be is cheap and has the nack of pasting a patch 011 a shoe with such cleverness that it is scacely visible. Most of them have very old suits of clothes, which they put on as soon as they arrive down town, and they all shave them­ selves, black their own boots, smoke cigarettes, go through no end of de­ privations and endure heart-rending miseries that they may be able to go with girls in the best society. Lots of fun is made of them, but, after all, they may be right, for dress has a grajdt deal to do with a man's success in New York. Business men like to be surrounded by fashion­ ably clad and prosperous-looking clerks, and the knowledge that he is wearing good clothes always imparts a certain amount of confidence to the wearer. The merchant tailors along Broadway and the better avenues brag principally of the fit they give their customers in return for a rather liberal expenditure of money. It does not do to go to a halfway tailor. Even though I10 succeeds in fitting you, there is sure to be a common look about the clothes. An ordinary suit, with a cut-away coat, made at any one of the hundred or two Broad­ way tailors, will cost from fifty to sixty dollars, and will look common­ place but durable. A similar suit bought of a swell concern, would cost seventy-five dollars, but it would be distinctively fashionable in cut, and have that peculiar air of distinction which goes to make a fashionable tailor's fortune.—Xew York CorreS' pondent Cincinnati Enquirer.

If any doubt existed in this section as to the genuine fairness of the Lousiana State Lottery in making,' its monthly and semi­ annual distribution of prizes, that doubt was dispelled Saturday night. A letter re­ ceived from a Cincinnati merchant in which the following postscript was added: "I see your town has again drawn capital prize in Louisiana Lottery," was sufficient to set our "city on the hills" in a blaze of ex­ citement. An indescribable hunt for ticket holders ensued. Pocket-books, day-books, desks, safes, trunks, valises, satchels, every­ thing was rummaged and tickets brought forth. For a time,suspense prevailed, and then the discovery was made that only one list had Been received at the postoffice, ad­ dressed to S. H. Bettys. Mr. Bettys and J. M. McDowell formed a partnership some time ago in the purchase of tickets,agreeing to divide profits, if any accrued. Mounting ahorse bright and early Sunday morning, McDowell went out throe miles in the coun­ try to see Bettys, and returning to town, Bettys' ticket and the number on the list, (46,799) corresponded. Going home in the western suburbs of Olivet, they were soon called on by the Tribune man, who wished to learn the particulars. Examining the ticket and list, we assured the parties that they were each $7,500 richer than they were previous to their last investment in tbe Louisiana State Lottery. The parties went to Maysville Monday morning, and deposited their ticket for collection with Pearce, Wallingford «& Co., of the State National Bank, the leading bankers ol Northern Kentucky and South­ ern Ohio, and in a few days will receive a check for their money. Mr. Bettys informed us that he had been holding a ticket regularly in the Louisiana State Lottery for four or five years, with the exception of a few monthly drawings, and he would have invested in them if he had had the money to spare. "I missed last September drawing with much reluc­ tance," said he, "butl had very urgent need of the dollar. I always recognized that the chance of drawing the capital prizo was meagre, but felt my chances were as good as anybody else's. My faith is rewarded after long years of deprivations by receiv­ ing a sufficiency ot money which, if judi­ ciously invested, will keep me in comfort­ able circumstances the remainder of my days." He has been a teacher in the pub­ lic schools of Robertson since the organiza­ tion of the county, at a salary ranging from $20 to $40 per month. Many are the con­ gratulations he is receiving on his streak of good fortune. SinceMontgomerydrew $15,000 in April, 1884, and even since Bettys and McDowell drew a similar amount in this month's drawing, we have received numerous letters from persons in several states and terri­ tories inquiring if the drawings were genu­ ine. In every instance we have taken pains to answer these questions in the affirma­ tive, and we again repeat through the col ums of the Tribune that these prizes were actually drawn by the parties mentioned. Montgomery purchased a farm near Mt. Olivet, for the use of his brothers, paying $3,000 therefor, and bought himself a farm within one mile of Mt. Sterling, for which he paid $9,500. Minor prizes, amounting in the aggregate to $1,000 or over, have been also drawn here, the largest ot these prizes being drawn by M. D. Ellis andNim rod Cumber, the former drawing $150 and tbe latter $70. The Louisiana State Lot­ tery is a square institution, regardless o! any doubts which may exist to the contrary. POSTMASTER GENERAL VILAS' HOME. Postmaster General Vilas hails from Madison, Wis., and that extremely pretty city is very proud of her handsome and eloquent cabinet officer, who, at the time he was chosen by Presidont Cleveland as one ot his advisers, represented her in the Wisconsin legislature. Madison is also proud because she is the State Capital and possesses a very imposing Capitol building standing in a lovely park. Then Madison inay also be proud of Wisconsin Univer­ sity, with its hundreds of students and able faculty of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home, of the State Lunatic Asylum build­ ings, and of the many industries which go to make up the prosperity of the thriving little capital. All these institutions have grown up since 1836, at which time Madi­ son was in the wilderness. Pushing and intelligent citizens have made her what she is, and it is pleasant to observe that Madi­ son still possesses a very large proportion ot clear-headed men and women, who ap­ preciate a good thing when they see it and are glad to make its merits known. One ot this class ofcitizens is L. A. Rog­ ers, the baggage-master of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, who is well known to all Madisoniuns and b,v a large part of the traveling public. Mr. Rogers has this to say of how he was cured of a long-standing complaint: "I suffered with rliumatism for some time, so that it was with great pain that I could move around at all, and I also spent many sleepless nights. I am glad to lay that after using two bottles of Athlo­ phoros I am entirely free from pain. No one need suffer from rheumatism if they will give it a fnir trial." George W. Huntly, a dealer in groceries at No. tt(5 Pinckney street, and a leading merchant and old resident, commends the medicine as follows: "I have used Athlophoros for rheuma­ tism and can inoHl cheerfully say with the most satisfactory results." "Mary I. Whiting, of No. 810 University avenue, who has lived in Madison for thir­ ty years and is known and respected by every one, says: "I have been a victim or severe rheuma­ tism for the past three years, and having tried almost every remedy known without any avail, I was much discouraged. Last winter I was afflicted much worse than over and was induced to try Athlophoros. I am glad to state tliatl am now free from pain and I pronounce the modicineaUod sendfor the afflicted." To those words of commendation may be added those of Mr. T. R. Lutzow, a well known citizen who says of Athlo­ phoros: •'My wife was seriously afflicted with rheumatism, principally in her arms. She has now used two bottles of Athlophoros and is well and free from pain. I can cheer­ fully recommend the remedy to my friends and the public as being all that it claims to be." William Sommers, foreman for B. F. McMillan & Bro., of McMillan, Wis., says that seven bottles of Athlophoros relieved him entirely of rheumatism of five years standing, which was so acute at times as to compel him to give up work. Three bot­ tles entirely cured his brother-in-law, Louis Ziinmering, whom rheumatism had com­ pelled to give up his place as edgerin a saw­ mill. He now fills his old position without tho least inconvenience. If you cannot get Athlophoros of your druggist, wc will send it express paid, on receipt of regular price—one dollar per bot­ tle.
