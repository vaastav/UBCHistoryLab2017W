The tract of ground known as tho old I Union dopot site, bounded by Ninth and Tenth avenues, and Seventh and Tenth strocts, Is looked on with such favor by the Oroat Western as a location for the road's depot that an offer of $20,000 has been j maim ijjt iiic tiKtiuB oi me rniiroau company tor mt property. For some time the comnnny has been willing to pay $lS,00fi for the tract, but the ownoM have held out for a higher figure and In the meantime there haa been talk of condemnation proceedings. Tho Great West ern people, however, are of the opinion that J peaceful methods are to be preferred and I have Increased tho ofTor. Tho figure now I offered by tho railroad company Is Fatlsfac I tory to the owners of the land and the con tracts have been drawn and the deal prac tically clostd. Heviral years ago these three blocks of ground were bought by an organization of local capitalists, who then contemplated tho eractlou oi a union pa88cngr station. The location Is regarded as an excellent ono for a paascngcr station and In securing It the (Jreat Western feels It Is putting Itself on a footing to compete with other roads entering tho city. Tho point of entrance of the new road Into the city has not been announced, but It Is generally believed that neither tho Indlin creek route nor the tunnel route will bo utilized, but that tho new road will come "around tho horn."

Attorney Hughes for Doylo concluded his nrgument nt 3 o'clock In tho nftcrnoon nnd Congressman Wnlter I. Smith entered upon the opening argument for Hums. Mr. Smtlh talked until thu hour of adjournment and then Intimated to tho court that ho was nearly through nnd would probnly finish within an hour or two this morning. On tho reconvening of court In tho morn ing Mr. Hughes did not resume his argu ment until Judge Rreeii had taken time to pass on slxty-threo interrogatories sub mitted by the attorneys for thu defendant. Of tho cntlro number Judge Orcen left standing less than a dozen of tho Interroga tories. Theso Included a question as to whether Doylo and Hums did really enter Into a partnership on February 2, 1S;2, ns claimed by Doylo. Throe of them nsk tho Jury to find whether Doylo owned an In terest In tho Iiohtnll No. 2, the Tidal Wave nnd tho Devil's Own respectively.

In concluding his nrgument Mr. Ilugheti outlined to tho Jury whnt the plaintiff Is contending for, nnd according to his com putations tho amount asked closely ap proaches $1,000,000. Judge Smith began his argument by In quiring Into tho rcasofiH for the bringing of tho suit by Doylo in this county. Mr. Hughos had said on Doylo'u behalf that thuy hnd come hero with the suit berauno this was the homo of tho Portland Oold Mining company ami because they had nn absolute right to do ho. Judgu Smith In reply charged that tho reoson tho suit was brought here was becnusu Doylo feared to try It among his nclghbora In Colorado, nnd declared that the only thing tho Portland company having Iti head quarters hero had to do with the suit being brought hero was that to sue Hums hero Doylo had to catch hi in hero nnd that ho did this when Hums canio to tho city ' to nttend un nnnunl meeting of tho corpo ration. This lino of thought wns kept beforo tho Jury In thn trentmont of tho va rious witnesses tnken up by Judge Smith nnd tho question frequently naked If theso woro not witnesses tlint Doylo might well prefer to tnko beforo n strnngo Jury to taking thorn beforo men who knew them.

Judge Smith charged that Doylo had on alx different occasions stated under oath that ho had no Interest In tho claims In which ho Is now claiming a half and cited ench of tho instances. With both parties to tho suit thus tiwearlng that Doylo has no Interest in theso claims Judgo Smith called on tho Jury to tell "what aro wo hero for?"
