Temma* Affklrt?lludicali Calling for Con> greaaional Interference?Htokea Want* Ma Htata Reconstructed Again. The disappointed radicals of Tennessee aro appa rcutly determined not to allow their successful rivals of the ilrdwnlow and Senter school to crow over the late peaceful revolntion at tbo ballot box in that State. Stoke* U in earnest abont demanding an investigation by Congress, and favora putting toe State out of tbo Union again until it shall become thoroughly localized or radicalized. In reply to a recent letter from some of his friends in Tennessee he writes aa follows, foreshadowing what he thirds and intends to do:? Washington, Dec. 14, I860. To Messrs. Sum.seit. Luwm aud others:? GbntlKuen? lour .etter in relation to the coming election ordered by the l.egisaturo has been re ceived. in my Judgment the whole movement in the way ol a convention is illegal, unconstitutional, void and revolutionary: the constitution and laws having been wholly disregarded In the late election, necessarily making void all la?s passed by that Ille gal and unconstitutional body. iue act calling a convention is an open violation of the constitution 01 the State, lor the reason that It permits every male citizen, who is twenty-one years of age, to vote, thereby ignoring the Siu.o constitution, aud allow ing every man to be a delegate in said convention, regardless oi the provisions oi the fourteenth article of the amendments to the constitution. 1 refer you to tne President's Message in relation to Georgia and the course pursued by Congress. Tennessee Is in u like condition, li Congress can enter any one of the Mates lately in rebellion tney can sareiy go Into all of those lately reconstructed. I have no hesita tion In saying that Congress possesses full power to re-enter tne late rebel states and reconstruct them again, aud as oi ten as the constitution is trampled uuder lo^t and the laws of Congress are set at nought. What Congress will do 1 am nnab:e to say at tins time; but oue thing Is certain, an investiga tion win be had concerning the irauds and violations oi the constitution of the State. Congress cannot reluse to investigate, as this is n national question, wuicli saps tne luuudution of republican govern ment. If I were at home I would not go near the fions on the day of tlio election. In a word, 1 would reut mo whole tiilug its revolutionary aud in viola tion oi the constitution and laws ot the state and tno reconstruction acts ot Congress. I am truly sorry that our lriendsare running candidates aud tnereby seemingly making themselves a party to this out rago. 'i hey should have stood aloof and took no art, and tuen those who claim to ua\e control of the tate government oouid uot nave complained. * * ?* I am truly yours, W. 1). 

STUKES. Eulogies on the J.ule Senator Krssendeii. Doth Houses spent the major part of to-day in burying the dead?at least there was little else done than eulogizing the late William Titt Fessendcn. The Senate galleries presented a very picturesque appearance, being crowded with fasbtonaoly dressed ladlea and the crime tie la crime of the brightest circles, who gathered to compliment by their presence the scb6larly Sumner, the erudite Trum bull aud other accomplished Senators who were an nounced a; the orators of the occasion. The speeches were nearly all good, sorao of them really ?loquout, particularly Sumuer's, Anthony's and Williams*. Authoiiy's portrayal of the character, acquirements and virtues of the departed states man was remurkablo for truth, simplicity and power: altogether it was, perhaps, tho ben delivered in either branch of Congress, aud leil with the more iorco upon the auditors for the reason that it was spoken without reference to man uscript or priutod slips, which in the case of all me other speeches considerably marred their effect. There is somethlug, alter all, in the appearance of elaborate preparation, suggested by turning over pages of mauuacrlpt or conttnnai reading from printed slips, that spoils the best speech, and espe cially one ol eulogy, which, if sincere, ought to flow freely and naturally, not stiffly and affcctcdly, as must be the case when the orator is ob served nicely adjusting hia eye glasses prepara tory to opening, and then deliberately perusing page after page of prepared sentences. The ludi crous aspect i the affair Is more likely to striae the bearers tK\i' the gravity and solemnity expected by the orat\s; and yet every speech delivered in the Senate id day, except one, was read, as if the gra^? euloglzcrs lcared they would not do Justice to themselves or to the departed were they to trust to memory or tho inspiration of tlio occasion. In the liouso of Representatives the same cold-blooded preparation aud elaborato agony were displayed, aud wiiat has been said of the Senators, therefore, will apply with equal force to the coinmouers.

Finally the discussion was cioHod and a vote waa taken, and Mr. Judd's amend, ment wus rejected?yeas 64, nays M. Mr. G\hfiki.d, (rep.) of Ohio, then moved tostrlko one section twenty-tour, winch proposed to tlx the number or representatives, tie thought It wiser to l?ave the whole matter ot spportioameut out of the bill and let th.it be reported tit another bill, whicn could also provide as io the manner and time of electing members or the Honse. Mr. ,\i.i is. n, (rep.) of Iowa, Inquired of Mr. Gar field whether nn proposed to introduce such a bill during me present session. Mr. (jlAKt'iiiLD rejilled that lis certainly did. Mr. Amjsom suid tlint with that understanding h" had no objection to tho striking out of the sootiou, but wlded tliut it was not Tair to leave the subject or apportionment, to the law of 1460, or to leave tne question open until alter the enumeration was taken. The rate of apportionment should be decided before tho result of the census would be known. After further discussion the motion was agreed to and the section was struck out. The section (No. which requires the statistics or railroad and ( anal companies and of the coastwise trade, and lake and iuland rtver navigation having been reached. Mr. (Uhkiki.d, from the Census Com mittee. offered un amendment requiring similar statistics irorn express telegraph and lile, lire and marine insurance companies. In relerence to llie Insur inc)) companies Mr. oarfleld stated that they based all their calculations on mortality tabiea; thst they were more man one hundred years old, and that the average duration of life had Increased con siderably since ilien. Their proflia were so great that one of the great lira Insurance companies of Now l'ork bad just comp eted one or the most mag nificent, noblo palaces that tn? city exhibited. Mr. Woodward, (dem.) of Pa., remarked that if the statement which he had seen as to the proas of life lusuranee companies In this country were true, that business had become on* of tho most stupen dous frauds ever practised. Mr, SraoNo. trap.) of Conn., advocated the amend- | merit, and spoke of the eaortnooa asset* ($12,000,000) poiaetaod by the nine Ilartford tire luaurance com panies Mr. btOKiaoLi. (rep.) of I1L, offered an amend ment, requiring statistics to be alsoprocured of too business 0/ bankers uud broken. The amendment W?? Mooted. Mf. C2*i j n reference to the section and amend ment expres.-wd tne opinion that tlte bill was over loaded with inquisitorial re nremenu far beyond what had been contemplate^ by Uiose who had made the con&utution or by those who had adminis tered it with 11yard to making the census. All that was originally intended was an enumeration of tha people lor the purpose of representation. With the particularities of this bill the census would not be completed la ten vcars. lie was amazed 10 see the wonderful particularity with which the railroad interest was to be inquired liuo. He heard the geu tlemanlroiu Ohio (Mr. carileld) say that tbey Were going to trrapple with that mammoth busi ness and briufir it to Its knees and stop Its high charges for transportation. What did the gentlemen propose to do when tbey got all this information? l>iu they propose federal legislation? If they would do something lor the pfifipl? by federa l legislation tec tuem stop granting subsidies and lands to railroads, winch had aireadr received lH0,000 0iw acres ol land, worth imowi.ooo. and in ?r)ous other wavs gcuUemeu on the other slae were responsible for budding up these monopolies, and now they waited Infor mation as to how to gTapple with the chlldien they themselves had created. Why did tuey on every occasion vote towp cltfai) labvr and cheap bread, lo voting against a reciprocity? Why not come up aun as ast the people in a practical war ? All this information sought (or. and ail the reasons given for It, were simply words; bat lie wanted to see acts lor the relief of the people. Mr. P?ub, (rep.) of Me., inquired whether most of the land grants were not made in I860, and whether the gentleman himself did not vote for them? Mr. Cox said he did not vote for them, nor bad he voted for the Pacific Railroad grams. Mr. Prtkks asked whether it was not a democratic Congress that had made tnose arrauta? Mr. Cox replied tuat there had not been a demo cratic Congress since tw. Mr Scofikld, trep.) of Pa., added that there never would be again. Mr. cox we.it on to say that the great balk of the land grants had been made by the republican party since I80 f, and he asked Mr. Garfield what he pro posed to do by federal action when he got all this Information. Mr. (Mtu iELn replied mat it was quite sufficient for the present to get light. He bad no ultra purpose on the subject except what was expressed on the very bill itself, to require those corporations to make an exhibit or their doings so that (he country mignt know how much was paid for transportation and whete the money went. Mr. Coub, rep.) of wis., offered an amendment to Mr. Uardcid's amendment requiring information to be obtained of the amount of l mtad states govern ment bonds held by corporations and individuals, lie wished that information in the hope that tne Committee on Ways and Means would devise some mode of taxing the interest on TTnited states bonds. Mr. Ursov, (repi of Olilo, offered a substitute requiring Information as to United btates bonds held by corporations executors administrators, guar dians and trustees, and by individuals. ' Mr. Garfield said he would be glad to get that information but the Censns Committee had come to tne conclusion that it would be useless to attempt to get It. It could not be got. THE

Tnero were representatives present from Cleveland, Pittsburg, Boston, Baltimore and this city. The meeting was organized with the election of Mr. W. P. Morgan, of Pittsburg, as chairman. A committee on business, appointed to prepare the question or questions to be considered by the Con vention. reported as follows:? Fir*?The question of crude oil, its pr?seot privity a* com pared with previous years: the cau*es tlmt 1m i' brought It to the condition lu which we find it; the a Vila couannuent there upon, and without indicating the manner lu which the object 1* to he nrcompl lahed, would yet lusgcti Hint thli subject ahould receive careful and thorough examination and action on the pert of this Convention, that the difficulty may be at once ana forever removed. It wltl alio be wed to consider the fact that a certain quan tity of oil purporting to be qrude, which la really mnnufac tured from roalduum It. 9. and naphtha, la, to a certain ex tent, added lu the to'Iverlea of crude. That thla feature pro valla only to a lmitiop extent la, perhaps, owing to the Inability ot the partlea to aupply thertiaalvai with the neuea .aary Insre'ilente; yet your commltte-i apprehend that this diitlcu'tv will be ofernorao uitleae tlio action <>f this Conven tion la ol a character like y to break up and deatroy the whole ayatcni of tnmt'erlni; with crude oil. The report of the committee was accepted and In the course of tho discussion, Mr. Flauleu, of Cleveland, read the following:? The munnfncto'-- Kid dealers In petrol ?nm of Clevelacd hereby ?<ree tual la all purcha*e< of crude oil mri'le by in oil anil alter the Sfitti day or September, l-d ?, we will recognize forty-el* degree* ol' speolils gravity at the IImll of merchant able oil. Id tbe erent of any oil being defcyeio I to u* <>. .ighier gravity than lorty-il* we will claim a deduction of an amount equal to two ami one-fuurtli per cent on tbe price paid per barrel for each and every degree abova forty-xli. It I* also agreed aud declared that any oil weighing lighter than forty-eight gravity It not merchantable anil will not be received by OS. Tbe Instrument need In obtaining the gravity ?ball be made to conform to J. Arnaboldl't SUndard Kaaumei Scale, which wa? adopted by the United Elates Petroleum Amociatlon May 1,1W4. An Informal discussion then sprang up in regard to the method of sampling oil, tho cnemical proper ties or oil. naphtha and benzine, and In regard to the gravity or merchantable oil. una gentleman was In favor of having no deflnite action taken by the Convention at thia meeting, or unril a report could be received from a committee which was now eugaged In making experiments at till Creek: tmt the majority seeme 1 to be in favor of some definite action being taken by the Convention. It was finally moved that a committee of three be appointed to mako the standard between the different gravities of oil, and what percentage producer* should allow to refiners If the oil rtris over the standard. Mr. Wicks moved to amend, by forming a com mittee of tho whole and take up the address or agreement ot inc Cleveland rellncrs as a basis of action. The amendment was adopted, whereupon Mr. Flaolku moved to have the paper so amended as to leave no ciiunce ror misunderstanding that the discu?uon and decision which might be arrived at was entirely In regard to crnde o l. Mr. Wicks moved to amend theflrst portion?r tho agreement by striking out "forty-six" and Inserting in lieu thereof "forty-ilve." on this ihe discussion sprung np anew. Mr. Clart. irom Cleveland did not wish to take an? arbitrary measures end a*k for oil at a standard at which they could not get It; thnt very little, if any, oil could be obtained below forty-six. Dr. Hsrz said it was forty-six bee <tno ttn pro ducers put beu/.oie in to clean out ttio wells. Dr. Egbert did not believe th it it w.ts possible to obtain oil below forty-six. and that there was in fact no natural oil below that gravity. lie referred to the now district, culled the ??Kcd Hot," In which it was Impossible because of the gases to use benzine, and vet the gravity was forty-nine, and he did nor, therefore, think it fair to ask for oil at forcy-t.ve de grees. Mr. WESTLAita, from Cleveland, said that, when ho bought oil by quantity and not by gravity he had had oil sent him from forty-seven to nfty-one aud ho had been told that largfe quantities ot bcuzlne was used at the oil regions for illegitimate purpose*. The Chairman (Mr. Morgan) compared oil to any other product or the earth. Tho oil dealer was just the same as a dealer m Hour, or iron or glass. The producer must sell his oil. Tho refiners have the matter in their own hands, and if they adopt a standard gravity and insist npon having oil fur nished them with that gravity as a bam* the pro ducer must sell. If he refuse, the refiner cau lot him keep it; he can't afford to build extra tanks and store the oil. He must sen lu I)r. EtmnHT thought if by placing a low standard of gravity the use of benzine would be stopped that they would In all probability suffer more from adultera tions with tar. Dr. 11 khz said there was little danger of that, as tar was too valuaolc. Mr. Wilts' amendment being pnt to the vote was adopted by a standing vote or fifteen to eleveu. Some further discission sprung up, lu which it was made manifest that several of me genti?ineu preae.it did properly uuder*tand ihe question aud conse quently a motion to reconsider was made and adopted. On motion of Mr. Clark, of Cleveland, the prodnrtffa who were present wore permitted to vote. Dr. Eobkrt said if a deduction were required ror any excels In weight on account or the benzine would an allowance be mado In proportion should ben7.me become, as u was more valuable tuau crude oil r or. Hkkz thought that question would l>n easily settled, as if benzine ever became mure variable tiiuii the oil it wouid not be used lor adulterating or doc toring the oil. Mr. I' t.iai.t r moved that lorty-six bo adopted as the standard,.and that a reduction ot prico he made lor oil above that gravity, and a pro rrt/a allowance bo made to the producer for oil lurulslied at a loner gravity. Mr. W'r^TTAKR thought that the Interests in tho business were not fully enough represented to tako any final action in regard to tho question of a stand ard of gravity, and be moved, therefore, that tue further consideration of tho question be postponed, uud the convoutton adjourn t? meet on the 2tsi ius?., at Tltnavlli<,. An amendment was offered to the effect that, as the 2lst wos so near the holidays, tho convention adjourn to the first week in Jutiuary. A aught dis cussion was then Indulged In, on tno ground that it would be futile to go atuoug tno producers and tisit tlieui to attend the convention wilu the hope of coming to any definite conclusion wheu those who were present, and toguard whose niteren Hie meeting was callod, could not determine among themselves just what they thought was right and what they wanted. Aa it wa? growing quite late Mr. Wn its moved that the meeting adjourn until half-past ten tmt morning. The motion was adopted and tbe meet lot adjourned. 

LECTURES LAST NIGHT. "CASTES A? MEEDS OF MBIA LMtm by Major A. fi. Constable. A paper was read last erematr before the fjonsr Island Historical Society, at the Parker institute, Brooklyn, by Major A. G. Constable, on the "Castes and Creeds of India." The audience was highly re spectable, appreciative and numerous. Alter a vlv'.d description of the natural beauties of India, the lecturer referred to the antiquity of its civilization, it being the earliest seat of tinman civil ization. and thougn at the present it had not ad vanced to the civilization of Europe or America, the Hindoos were not very far removed from the high social progress of either of these countries. As to tue climate, Hiudostaa (tie land of the nindoos) had been designated the epitome of tbe whote World, for It embraced within itsMf the physi cal features consequent upon the rays of tbe tropi cal sun and the cold of the polar regions. He then described tbe geographical position or India, aud ttieu passed ou to speak or caste. Caste was enforced by law and sustained by an assumption or dlvtne authority, and It lenetrstel ltselt luto every phase or foeiety. In the description ol Brahmins Major Constable said that it was i*. llevea Brahma was the conscious, self-supported essence, having no creation, aud waj in itself the Preserver aud the Destroyer. The worship of one haudred and sixty millions of people was pretty well divided between these two aspects or the Brahmin faiih, that of the Preserver and the Destroyer. The household deity, Vishnu, aud the concurrent creeds or tbe worshippers of this deity were then commented upon. Caste which was once political Is now a religions lnsntutlou. and o( these there are four prudes de scended from Brahma. From me lowest of these grades It was impossible tor those or their descend ants to rise to higher social grades. There were wealthy merchants in Calcutta whose social position was in these lower grades, and their wealth was powerless lu helping ibem to the position occupied by a higher caste or tbe Brahmins. The l*arlahs were au outcast people who were not allowed to associate with auy other caste, lu conse quence of the forfeiture of their right to auy privi lege of this kind. Toe Hindoos had always remained a conquered people. There liart not risen among them a Hiuiatu Tell or a Robert Bruce, and yet they were an en lnrhteucd people; they were not lKuorant. A thou sand years ago every village had its school, and the British had continued this universal school system. How was it. then, that this people were still uuder the yoke ol the conqueror f He answ ered that it was caste. In that one word was louud the reason. Ho Ion* as that remained a burden npon the aspira tions of the people no progress could be mude. No revolutionary wave of general advancement could carry this great people to power, ror lrcedom was a word that was unknown to the Hindoos A vote ef thanks to the lecturer brought the pro ceedings to a close.

DESERT AND M&UNT SINAL Lecture by Rev. A. TV. Kitiredce. "The Bedouins of the Desert and Mount Slum" was the picturesque subject selected last evening by the Rev. Abbott W. Klttredge for the second of his conrse of free lectures before the Young Men's Christian Association in the Spring street Presby terian church. The hall was crowded, a very large number or ladies being present, and the proceedings were commenced by hymn and prayer. The lec turer was Introduced to the meeting by Mr. J.'H. Uradcn. the president of the association. He sal 1 the tacts he would give relative to the Bedouins were the result ol personal observation and inter views with the wild tribes of the desert. The penin sula of Bluai lies between the Qulf or Suez and the Qnir ot Accoba. From the qourrlct ot this picturesque district the stones were takeu with which the Pyramids or Kgypc were erccted. It was a silent, voiceless, desolate waste, that throngli wlilch the chlldien of Israel had Journeyed for forty years under tho special direction or Jehovah. Tho home or the Bedouins Is an unbroken waste, broken in somt?uarb> by sandy lulls aud mountains whose conllguratlon Is at once peculiar aud sublime. The mounMiui o( Hadshal lah lie described as the paint shop or tlie Almighty, in which orange, vlolot, blue, red, purple pink and many delicate hues and tints make one ol the rich est pictures presented by nature 011 Hie giobc. Here, also, the laudscape is one magnlGoa&t mosaic, every shell aud arrant of sand tiavmg a hue of its own, and is yet in harmony with all the others. The isolation of tho Bed ouins from the rest of the known world waj the most remarkable feature ot the tribe. Thev bad no commuulcatlon wilb the outor world, acknow ledged no allegiance to any government and wuatcd to owe none. They wero divided into tribes, all separated froia each other, wttti their own customs, manners and dre-s. They never intermarry, ana cannot, without danger to Hip, cross over into the territory of another trioe. After leaving Cairo you tlrst passed into the cave ot Teewarha aud then to tue Teaua, tue former with a mild the latter with a wild class o( feature*. Five miles to the earn unouter tribe lived, whoso hands arc a, uinst every inuii, who atrip every traveller tb?y weoi of a;i lie lids save his hat and tioota, which ihoir customs rendered outiroljr uselc.c. Tne Qons-j of the Kodouiu Is his rent, it is low and flat, and made by stretching a p:eco of cloth upon lour poles about lour feet high. There the family live with their lambs, kids and gouts, and a lew dogs. lie roams about massing one season in one valley, and then shifting lila quartern to another, They wcro not unlike the .New ?orkrrs who seldom had a home, and barely understood the dearest and moat poetic reclines, temleruea* and associations which were attached to the homestead. There is no education among the bedouins. Among teu thousand of theso intelligent Ishmaeiltes he could not And one person able to read or write. The laws wore unwritten. There was no court, no Justice; but relerence was occasionally made to the ehlef of the tribe, wjiose authority was merely nom inal. Dr. Kittredge illustrated the various peculiar traits of these singular people, oy several frequent and Interesting anecdotes, and was intern:,t to with marked attention and frequently applauded.

PITAL* lateremini Ceriiuoulci at the I'uion Leitfiie Club Theatre I.ant Nijritr. Last evening the inaugural ceremonies of the Hahnemann Hospital were celcbratod at the Union League Club theatre, comer of Twenty-sixth street and .Madison avenue. The theatre was crowded to lta utmost capacity by a select audience, among whom were a large number of ladies. Dr. John Z. Gray, who occupied the cUair, opened the proceedings by stating the object of the meeting, which, he said, was to found and support a new in firmary for the homeless invalid poorou the lioiuao pathic plan. The chair then Introduced Mr. Oeor.e 0. Barrett, the Preside ut of tlio newly established hospital. Judge liApitETT, who was received with applaui-e, said?Tae last tune I trod these boards It was to attend a lair for the kick and wounded of the patriot army of Cuba. 1 stand hero to-night to speak for the sick and disabled around us. I don't know why 1, a layman, should be called upon to make this Address while I see so many distinguished physicians around me, unless it be that there are a majority <if my countrymen?Irishmen?in the Board of Tfueteea. My earliest acquaintance with houiceo patuy has left a pleasing aud grateful memory in niy mind, aud it surprises me beyond measure that the general community appear to be so totally iguorautoi the life auJ works ot the father and founder of this new school 01 medicine, me speaker tnen gave an interesting liuitoiy of the life of Hamuel liiitnieuiann. from whom the newly founded hospital has received its uaiue, from ins birth in i".?6, through Ills lung, laborious ana useful life. The speaker tueu said illness should t>e cured by fixed principles, it seems to me to bu the essence of quackery to set a practitioner go in the world us a physician and prescribe ?omethiug because H may cure, it is tint considered important iu homoeopathies to llnd out the nature ot the disease. Hoiiia-upuituc physicians do not even Inquire as to the nat ure or cause of the disease, l'liey don't waut to know tue disease. They study tlio symptoms and prescribe for them, ruelr prescription* invariably cure?tuey can never injure On the contrary, the allopathic physician seek* the nature of the disease horn the symptoms, and an error of Judgment, which even the highest science cannot guard against, may be fatal. The lecturer here related several anecdotes In proof of what he had stated, and concluded bv stating that homoeopathy respects human nature; It does not treat the body as a piece of lileiess jlay that may be drugged and hacked in pleasure; It treats the ij'WCs, the spirit aud the sou , and. re garding the body us a frail temple, Coiiiutuuig au elastic and subtle spirit, it treats 11 gcntl f, and Inva riably with suocessiul nwlui. we need anoppoiut ility to test the principles of this new school.

There aie uot many persons in this city wlio know fully of the extensive and lucrative fisheries estab lished at the eastern end of Long Island, and the ex tent of employment they afford to hundred* of fami lies in the vicluity of Pecouic and Garderner'a bajra. The .Menhaden lishery of Peconlc Bay Is a very em tensive business. Menhaden Is thd name of a pecu liar species of fish that comes in vast shoal* in the spring of the year Into the bays at this end or Long Island, for the purpose of spawn tug. At that stage. However, tney are generally in poor condition and yield but little oil. They are taken in semes and* some enormous hauls are oftentimes made. Tne fish is not for eating, and the business of catching is to render the menhaden into oil and manure. Prom estimates furnished br the principal Usher men engaged In tne menhaden fishery the number taken during the past season Is put down at 07500,000. in addition the shore seines and pounds took &,600,U0u, of which more tuati one Half was soid to farmers to be applied to the land for manure, wntlc the remainder were taken to lactorles to be trausiuutC'i into oil. About twenty years ago the business of extracting oil from menhaden was commenced with the estab lishment of one factory, and since then It lias grown to immense proportions. Durlug the past yeur there have been as many as seventeen factories in operation lor a greater or le-.s time on the shores of Peconio and Gardiner')* nays, la nearly all cases the owners of factories have two or more gangs fishing for them and lurnisli the boats aim nets, with all the other apparatus the fishermen supplying only their labor and receiving a stated prise per thousand for their share01 the nsh, the boats taking a third, the capital invested in these factories and in the boats, nets, Ac., Is about half a million dollars. Besides this sum a number ol the rictier folks In the vicinity have Invested largely in similar fac tories in Maine, lUiode Inland, Connection New Jersey aud Virginia so that the total amount invested in tne business roaches a figure climbing up close to a million. Uut season there were over thirty gangs of men, numbering three boats to a gang, out la Pecouic Bay, one of which, commanded by Captain Oliver Downs, made the largest -catch," which was 6,0o0,00u of Qsh. i he lowest was boo.ooo; the ave rage 2,600,000. Tho growing importance of the business Is well appreciated in Greenport, L. L, and measures are agitated to &ld its greater and more lucrative development. The Interests bound up in ilila object aro numerous and varied. Everybody Interested in the growth of this section of Long island fees mat It cannot oe better encouraged than in seizing this unique and exclusive source of natural wealth and bringing it to the highest stage of commercial value and development. For a period of seven months last season over loo vessels and over 300 men were employed in the bays, and, united to the other general commerce, which is uli the time undergoing enlargement, helps to make tins pan or Long is.and a place of far more Importance than is generally believed. Tho oil ex truded irum iue ash is used for various purposes or dreeing leather, in ropewalks, In painting, mixing with other oils. Vc. ihe scrap is used as manure. La^t season the produce was 7,106 tons of manure aud ll,4io barrels or oil. The one great desideratum which the people of this part of the island most anxiousiv look for to the general government is the erection of a lighthouse on Long Beach bar?the only dlulcult or dangerous place tuc fishermen have to pass on their irips up and down tue bay. The expense which the national government is asked to Incur in aiiording safety to tue poor mariners who carry their fortunes In their humble fishing crafts np aud ootvn tue bay, through all kindj oi weather and at all hours of tne day or nigiit, Is ol comparatively suiall amount. The erection of a lighthouse would involve no eutfiueering dliUculties whatever. A solid foun dation can iw found a few feet below tue surface of the tide. A light, cas.lng its friendly radiance across the waters at tuis point In years past, might nave been the means ol saving many a gutlaut little crait and kept tne black shadow of desolation irom many a home. The national gov ernment was never before called upon to appropri ate money for a more laudable purpose tiian this, li the people have any reasoa in casing the govern ment under which they live wise and paternal, it is In just such instances as this, where tlm means of the national treasury are given to consummate a work which Inures to the general good and which the means of the community itself are Itisnfllclem to secure. Any one who looks at the map or Long Island will notice the very many creeks, bays aud inlets of the sea which mark its eastern boundary, it may bo easily interred that considerable risk Is often tunea run In navigating thereabouts when It is both dark and botsterou? aud no visible guide on coast or promontory, ihe lighthouse, wuich it la tne anxious desire of tue peopie to see erected, woulu point the way to other boats than tlioae sail ing directly in Hue with it aud save *v?v " r more than the cost of its construction. still anotner great purpose wmcu will be served by the erec'ion of a lighthouse on Long Beach bar will consist in tne fact ihat a splendid haven?at present useless, because almost inaccessible?will be secured under cover of Shelter Island. Vessels com ing to .New lork through the bound lrequently, wuen bad weather arises, have to put back for a harbor to Newport or Holmes' llole. In entering the Sound tue usual channel is through i'lum Gut, aud the distunce to be retraced to secure a harbor at either of the liuvenq .a-i named involves a great loss of ume. Iue tide sots through Plum Gut an honr aud a half earlier, aud the channel past Long Heacli point has a unuorm depth o! tturty feet.' Vessels, tuerflore by a comparatively slight deviation from their course, couid, if the navigation of Long Beach inlet were facilitated by a light, secures good safe anchorage aud easily resume tuetr course with the earitr tide In their favor, saving a considerable time aud sailing dutauce.
