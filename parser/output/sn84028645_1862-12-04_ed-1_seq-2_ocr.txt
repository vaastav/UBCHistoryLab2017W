And yet I wish to aay there la an objection urged againat free oolored persons remaining in the country, which la largely Imaginary, If not aometlmea malicious. - It la Insisted that their presenoe would In Jure, and displace white labor and while labor is. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catob arguments, that time snrely Is not now. in lime, use in. preseni, men euumu utter nothing lor which they would not willing ly be responsible inrougn lime ana in eierunj u it trn. then, that oolored people oan displace anv more white labor, by being free, than by remaining slavesT If they etay In their old places, tbey jostle no white laborers; If tbey leave their old plaoes, they leave them open lo white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of It. Emancipation, even with out deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and, vary aur.ly, would not reduoe them. Thus, the oustomary amo.nt of labor would still bav. to be performed; th. fr.ed people would surely not do more tbsn their old proportion oi it, ana very prooao7, tor a time, would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor Into greater demand, and, consequently, enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanoed wages to white labor ia mathematically certain. Labor la like any other commodity in the market inorease the demand for it, aud yon Inorease the price of 11. Reduoe the supply oi black labor, by colonis ing the black laborer ont of the country, and, by precisely so muoh, yon increase the demand for, and wages or, wmie lanor.

Could the one, in any way, greatly dUurb th. sevenf There are many communities now, baying mor. than on. free eolcred person to seven white.; and tbls, with out en v apparent consciousness of evil from It. Tbe District of Columbia, and the Slates of Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condi tion. Tbe District has more then One free oolored lo six whites; and yet, In lta frequent petltiona to Congress, I believe It has never presented tbe presenoe of free oolored persons as one of its grievances. But why should emancipation aouth, aend the freed people north? People, of any color, seldom run, un less theie be something to run from. Hereto fur colored people, to some extend, have fled north from bondage; ana nets, pernapt, irom both bondage and destitution. But II gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flea from. Their old mas ter, will give them wages at least until now laborers can be procured, and the freed men, In turn, will gladly give their labor for the wages, till new homes can be found for them, In con genial climes, and with people of their own blood and race. This proposition oan be trust ed on the mutual Interests involved. And, In any evsnt, connot th. north decide for Itself, whether to receive them? Again, as praotlo. proves more than theory, in any case, has there been any irruption of oolored ueople northward, because of the abol ishment of slavery in tnis visirict last spring? What I have aaia or tne proportion of tree oolored persons to tne wmtes, in tbe District, Is from the census or 1000, nsving no reference to persons called contrabands, nor to those made free by tne act or tvongress aoonining slavery bete. The plan consisting of these artloles ia re commended, not bnt that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption. Nor will the war, noi proceedings under the proclamation of September 29, 1062. b. staved beosnee of tbe recommendation of thla plan Its timeiv taotium i aouot not, would bring re storation, and thereby etay both. And, notwithstanding tbls plan, the recom mendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt eman cipation, before this plsn shall have been acted npon, Is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the ssme arguments apply to both. This plan is reoommended as a means, not in exolusion of, bnt additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national au thority throughout the Union. The subject la preaented exolualvely in its economical aspect. The plan would, I am .confident, secure peace more speedily, ana maintain it more permanent ly, than can be done by foroe alone; while all It would coat, considering amounts, and man ner of payment, and time, of payment, wonld be easier paid than will b. th. additional cost of lb. war, If w. rely solely npon force. It la much very much that it wonld ooet no blood he plan la pre posed as permanent constitu tional law. It cannot become each without th. concurrence of, first, two-thirds ot Congress, ana, auerwara, tnree-iourtns oi in. stsiee Th. requlait. three-fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of tbe slave States. Their conourrenoe, If obtained, will give as surance of their severally adopting emancipa tion, at no very distant dsy, npon the new con stitutional terms. This assurane. would end the struggle now, and save tbe Union forever. I do not forget th. gravity which should characterise 4' paper addressed to tb. Congress of the nation, by tb. Chief Magistrate of the nation. Nor do I forget that some of yon are my seniors; nor that many of yon hav. mor. experience than I, In the conduot of publio af fairs. Yet I trust thai In view of the great responsibility resting npon me, yon will perceive no want of respect to yourselves, in any nodue earnestness I may seem to display. Is It doubted, then, that the plan I Drowse, if adopted, wonld shorten tbe war, end thus less en its expenditure of money ana or blood? Is It doubted that It would restore th. national authority and national prosperity, and perpetu ate both Indefinitely? . Ia II doubted that we hereCongress and Juteonllve can aeoure Its adoption? Will not tbe good people respond to united, and earnest appeal from us? Can wa. can they, by any other means, so certainly, or ao apeediiy, aaaure thase vital objects? We oan ooceed only by concert It is not - oan any of ns fmffin setter " out "can we mu do bet ter?" Obiecl whatsoever is possible, still th question reenra "oan we do better?" The dog ma, ef the quiet past, are inadequate to tbe stormy present, rne occasion la piled high with difficulty, and we most rise with the occa sion.

We print tbis dooument in tttento, In all the editions of tbe State-sham, this morning. Hav ing received an cfflolal copy, on yesteidsy, from Mr. Cox, we sre enabled lo give our readera the Message as it was delivered to Congress. Olds Elected by 2500 Majority. Dr Olds was, on Tuesday, elected a Member of tb. Ohio Legislature, by the invincible De mocracy of Fairfield coacty, receiving Ihe ex Inordinary majority of t tkoutand fit hund red. Thla is one of the moat significant results that we have had the pleasure to announce since these perilous and troublous times came to afflict the people of this country. The Doctor wss illegally and unwarrantably arrested at the midnight hourand forcibly re moved from tbe State of Ohio to Fort Lafayette, now one of the Bistilea of thla Administration. There he bas been incarcerated for four montha, in a damp and filthy cell, not knowing what charges have been preferred againat him, nor who bis cowardly aoonaert are. His repeated demands to be pnt npon trial have been perslat- ently disregarded; and be la still in prison, or was a few dajs ago. Now the loyal people of bla own county have oast lor him by far tbe largest majority, for Representative, ever before given there.' Tbe result Is a condemnation, expressed In thunder tones, of tbe whole system of arbitrary and Illegal arrests. Hie malloioue and cowardly assailanta and persecutors bad not even tbe moral courage to run one of their oan persua sion against blm. This fact glvea thelmmenae vote polled .till greater significance. These Isn't room enough In all the Government b se ttles throughout the country, to contain even tbe Fairfield county "sympathisers" with Dr. Oui. - The First S. C. V.—Rev. Col. Higginson. A Boston jiispatch announcea that Rev. T.W. HteuiMsoH, of Worcester, Mass., has accepted tho Coloneocy of the First Regiment of South Carolina Volunteers. Rev; Col.

This First South Carolina Regiment la com posed of fugitive slaves, or as President law com would express It, of "free persons of Af rican descent." Tb. Rev. Colonel is, w. be lieve, a white man with Afrloan proclivities The regiment Is organised, we suppose, to aid in pulling down the rebellon in South Caro lina and In restoring that State to tbe Union. It is the beginning of an experiment whioh the Abolitionists particularly Gaitui have been insisting should be tried. . aa they alleged it wonld prove efficacious. ' We shall see how It will work. We wait to hear of tbe gallant exploits of the First South Carolina nnder the command of tbe Rev. Colonel Hmminson, who has yel to make a military, ae well as a tho logioal and literary reputation. . Perhaps it is not a aoppoaable oase, but if ll were, we cannot help wondering, if a large portion, aay a majority of the psopl. of Ohio, were In rebellion sgslnsf the National Govern ment, bow her oltlxso. would eel, should that Government organise and arm a regiment of bar free negroes and call it Ihe 1st Ohio.

The Cincinnati Qtuttt of Monday devotee Its leader to a defenaeof "Retaliation for Rebtl Atrocities." Half tho oolumn la given to a Juatlflcatlon of Ihe fiendish and wanton murder of ten oltissna or Palmyra, Missouri, by oraer of General MoNwt. The OtuUt p.ralatently denlea or Ignores Ibeaooredltedand well-known facts of tbe eaeo, as presented to tbe pnblio In nomarona lettera from that vlolnlty, and also in article, from Union papers of thai Stale. - It will be remembered that Ihe ten men aalsed and ahot because Allsaun, alleged to bav. been captured and held by the rebels, was not returned within brief speoified lime, were not r.b.l soldiers, bul oltlsens. Thai thsy sympathised with Ih. rebels, and that some of tbem bad been engaged In guerrillas, Is nol de nied; but tbey were not then nnder arms, or engaged In any open aote of hostility to tbe Government. Tbe wife of Allsman begged MoNiib to spue these men for a few daya, and aee if her husband would not return; bul her esrnesl en treaties were Indignantly apnrned. Aluman bas slnoe returned; be was In Illlnola at the time; not In tbe band, of tbe rebels, but beyond tbetr reach. The whole proceedings were characterised by tbe most heartless and fiendish atrooity. For example, a young man, who had no family to take oare of, came forward, and offered blm' self, and waa aocepted as a substitute for I friend who had a wife and children dependent npon blm. No aimy officer, ao far aa the pub llo has beard, has attempted to excuse or de fend the conduct of MoNsjl; but several have cat blm Id the most direct way. One wbom be met tn St. Lsnis publicly refnsed to drink with him; told blm he did not drink with murderers, and that he was a disgrace to the service, and endsd with giving his address for the conveni ence of McNkil, If be thought blmaelf Insult ed. Otber offloers among tbem Gen. Mo- KiNi-rsr havs denounced bim lo bis face in atrong terms, aud refused to acoept or renew his acquaintance. These and otber facta have shown that tbe killing of those ten man waa not justified by toy rule of olvllised, eoaroely, of aavage war fare, but waa simply a cold blooded and heart less murder suoh as only a (lend could commit, and thst it is ao regarded both in and ont of the army. And yet strange to aay, the Qtzttlt attempts lo defend aod justify It. Ita argument la a pieoe of cheap and oommor sophistry. The real faota of the case are Ignored, while false soggestlons scd sssumptlons are substituted. In tbls wsy the Oatetle prepares Itself to asy: Tbey who sre on the side of the Government for which Gen MoNell ia fighting, will natu rally conclude that the bearing of all tbe cir enmstsnoes wss toward Justification of his sot, until the oontrary is shown. Tbe contrary has not bsen shown. There is an effort to excite publio indignation over tbia affair, to reflect odium on the oause, bnt ll comes from those whose prejudices are too much In favor of tbe side for which Gsn. Porter is fighting, to per mil tbem to tske a just view of the cue. A paper, which finds itself driven to tbe ne oejeity of excusing and defending that heartless murder, might do well to give np the leek of trjlug to find grounds for accusing Democratic papers of disloyalty. Il will prove Vbor lost Tat New York Espreu calls lor an inquiry into the case of tbe three New Orleans clergy, men, Drs. Liacooc, Fulton, and Goodmoh, In carcerated In Fort Lafayette for the great crime of omitting to pray for tbe President! It says if they have violated any rnles or regulations of their Church, let Its constituted suthorlUs mete out an ecclesiastical punishment, but we, the people, demand no connection with Church and Slate, and if these clergymen have not violated the Constitntion or tbe laws, their im mediate rslease should be demanded as a right guaranteed by the Constitution.
