Mr. Bates neglected to return thanks to the managers of the various pumpkin shows it ho have entertained him so samptnonsly daring h s term of office. Such an over sight is unpardonable. There is a lamentable lack of reportoria interpolations of "laughter and applause" in Mr. Hayes' annual message. Were the olaquera absent when it was read to the as sembled wisdom of the nation? Sitting Bull, it is reported, is willing to surrender. He should be permitted to do so, but only on condition that his carcass shall decorate the limb of the first tree this side of the boundary of the British poses* Bions. \ .. . The firat three or four pages of Mr. Hayes message commanded the attention of the House, bat when it was found that it dealt in generalities the interest subsided, and no further attention was paid to the reading. Mr. Hayes may congratulate him self on the fact that this id the last occasion upon which ho will enbiect himself to ridi cule. MR. 

HAYEI,' MESSAGE. Mr. Hayes has submitted to Congress and the public in general the last message ho will have the privilege of writing, except in the capacity of a private citizen. It is a voluminous document, and in a literary point of view is equal to most cf such pro ductions of recent date. It is not, however, remarkable for statesmanship, but rather for the narrowniindednssa thtt has bit along i cuaractized the man who has for four years occupied an office to which he has neither legal nor moral title. Opening with the hackneyed and hypo critical thanks to divine providence for. health and prosperity, Mr. Hayes proceeds to refer to the facility with which power is transferred under our form of government from one person to another. He then takes up the cudgel on behalf of the colored race, and gives voice to the Blander that has been the stock in trade cf the Republican party for years past that colored men in the varion i parts of the South have been deprive of the elective fran chise. It is hardly possible that a man oo ouppying the position that Mr. Hayes has done should be so lacking in information, and so blind to the most potent facts as to •assert what is not susceptible of proof, and is, indeed, contradicted moat emphatically by the best evidence in the world. The negroes are not deprived of their right to ex* ercise the elective franchaise in any State in the Union. They are accorded more rights and privileges than poor white men receive in New England, and Mr. Hayes might have done a greater service by calling attention to the debased condition of New England labor ers than in wasting so much space upon a race that enjoys more privileges than are ac corded to the Caucasians. If he had even men tioned the oppressions that the white slaves of capital are subjected to, his plea for the negroes would not have appeared as con spicuously mere partisan clap-trap. Mr. Hayes is benevolent. His benevo lence of heart has been noteworthy daring his entire term of office—when the people footed the bills. This sentiment crops out in the recommendation that his predecessor in office be created captain general of the army at a good round salary, with provision for his retirement, presumably on full pay. The suggestion will probably be unheeded by Congress. It certainly ought to be treat ed with absolute contempt. Grant does not deserve more honors than he has already re ceived, and the proposition to make him a live pensioner upon the bounty of the peo ple is not worthy of the slightest consider ation. Mr. Hayes has a good deal to say about civil service reform. Hia hints ere not without merit, but the fact that he neglected to carry out his own ideas and throws out the suggestions for the benefit of his suc cessor will detract largely from their value. He was too cowardly to enforce his theories, but allowed the basest of his subordinates to spit upon his civil service order No. 1, yet he has the effrontery, on the eve of his retire ment from office, to insist that Congress shall place restrictions upon his successor that he himself refused to recognize. Taking the message as a whole it is not a bad one. It is precisely what was expected —a defense of the partisan conduct of the executive and his associates, a glorification of the results of the financial polioy pursued, and an appropriation of the blessings of divine providence to the Republican party. Mr. Hayes has simply proved that his administration has been a fortunate one, a fact that everybody has known ail along. That our relations with foraign powers have been friendly is cot the credit of the State department, for there has beau no occasion for a rapture of peace. No international questions of consequence have arisen within the past four years, nor is there any likeli hood that they will arise in tae four years to come. What sort of a President Mr. Hayes might have made in time of emergency will never be known. That in very ordinary times be made a very ordinary President -will probably never be disputed. PERSONAL.

The director of the survey recom mends that the investigations carried on by his bureau, which bo far have been confined to the so-called publio land States and Territories, be extended over the entire country, and that the necessary appropriation be made for thin pur pose. Thin would be particularly beneficial to the iron, coal and other mining interests of the Mississippi valley and of the Eastern and Southern States. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of Congress. DEPARTMENT BUILDINGS. The secretary of the interior asks attention to tho want of room in the public buildings of the capital now existing and in progress of construction for the accommodation of tho clerical force employed, and of tho public rec ords. Necessity has compelled tho renting of private buildings in different parts of the city for the location of public offices, for which a large amount of rent is annually paid, while the separation of offices belonging to the same department impedes the transaction of current business. The secretary suggests that tho blocks surrounding Lafayette square, on the east, north and west, be purchased as the sites for new edifices, for the accommodation of srovernment offices, leaving tho square it self intact, aid that if auch buildings wero constructed upon a har monious plan of architecture they would add much to the beauty of the national capital and would, located there, with the treasury and the new state, r avy and war department builtii:ic,form one of the most imposing groups of public edi fices in tho world. 

BDBKAU OF AGBICULTCBE. The commissioner of agriculture expresses the confident belief that his efforts in behalf nf the production cf our own sugar and tea have been encouragingly received. The im portance of the results attained have attracted marked attention at home ana have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own tea and the manufacture of our own sugur would make a difference of many millions of dollars annn ally in the wealth of the nation. The report of the commissioner asks atten tion particularly to the continnod prevalence of an infectious and contageous cattle disease known and dreaded in Europe and Alia a* the cattle plaguo or pluro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease in certain sections of our country is the occasion of great loss to our farmers, and of serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britian, which furnishes a market for much of our live stock and dressed meats. Tho value of neat cattle exported from tho Uciied States for the eight months ended August 31, ISS'J, was mure than twelve million dollitrn, and nearly doable tho value for the same period in 1579. an unexampled increase of export trade. Your early attention i? solicit ed to t;;ia important matter. EDUCATIONAL. Tho commisfi:;ncr of education reports a continued increase of public interest in ednca tionai affairs, and that the public sohotils {ren- I enliy throughout the country arc wcil sus tained. Industrial braining is attracting de served attention, and eollrgea for inß'raction. theoretical and practical, in agriculture and the mechanic arts, including the government schools recently established for the instruction of Indian youth, are gaining eteadily in public estimation. Tte commissioner a3fcs special attention to tbo depredations committed on tho lands reserved for the future support of public institutions and to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the Territories and in the Southern States. The recommendation heretofore made ia repeated and urged that an educati _>na! fund be act apart from tho net proceeds of the sales of the public lands, annually, the income of which, and the remainder of the net annual proceeds, to be distributed on some satisfactory plan to the States and Territories and the District of Columbia. The succee3 of the public Bchools of the Dis trict of Columbia nnd the progress made un der the intelligent direction of tho board of education and the superintendent in supplying the educational requirements of the district with thoroughly trained and ilieient teachers is very gratifying. The acts of Ccnrrc-ps iron lime to lime, do nating public lands to tho ntveial States and Territories,in aid of educational interests, have proved to be wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. It would teem to be a matter of simple justice to extend the benefits of this legislation, tho wis-. dom of which haa been so fully vindicated by experience to tho 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 1 again commend the general interests of the j District of Columbia to the favorable consider- I ation cf Congress. Tho affairs of the district, as shown by the report of the commissioners, are in a very satisfactory condition. Ia my annual messages heretofore, and in my special message of December 19, 1v79, I have urged upon the attention of Congress the necessity of reclaiming the marshes of the Potomac, adjacent to tho capital, and I am con strained by its importance to advert Kgaiu to the subject. These flats embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impediment to tho drainage of the city and seriously impair its health. It is believed that with this sub stantial improvement of its river front tho capital would be in all respects one of tho most attractive citiea in the world. Aside from its permanent population this city is necessarily the place of residence of persons from every section of the country engaged in the publio service. Many others reside here temporarily for tho transaction of business with the government. It should not be for gotten that the land acquired will probably be worth the cost of reclaiming it, and that the navigation of the river wrll bo greatly improv ed. I, therefore, again invite the attention of Congress to the importance of prompt provis ion for this much needed nnd too long delayed improvement. The water supply of tho city is inadequate. In addition to the oidlnary use throughout tho city, the consumption by the government is necesearily very groat in the navy yard, ar- 1 senal and the various departments, and a large quantity is required for the proper preßerva- ' tion of the nuinerona parka and tha cleansing of sewern. I recommend that this subject re ceive the early attention of Congress, and that in making provision for an increased supply 1 such means bo adopted as wil , have in view the future growth of the city. A temporary expedient for such a purpose can not but be wasteful of money and therefore '• unwise. A more ample reservoir with corres ponding facilities for keeping it tilled should 1 in my judgment be constructed. I commend again to the attention of Con- 1 gress the subject of the removal from their , present location of the depots of the several railroads entering tho city, and I renew the ' recommendations of my former message 3 in ] behalf of the erection of a building for the Congressional library, the completion of the 1 Washington monument and of liberal appro- 1 priations in|support of the benevolent, reforma tory and penal institutions of the district.

Startling Occnrrauce in a Sixth Ward Res idence— A Drunken, Stupid Wretch Glori ously Punished as he Deserved. The residence of ex-Aid. J. C. McCarthy in the Sixth ward, was the scene of a start ling midnight episode night before last which threw the members of the household into a furore of excitement. About mid night the occupants of the house were start led from slamber by a succession of screams proceeding from an apartment occupied by a lady member of the family and situated in the rear part of the house. The doughty ex-alderman got to hit) feet instanter and hastened to the room mentioned, followed by his eon and other members of the family. On reaching the apartment an amazing tableau was presented. The lady who had given utterance to the outcry was in the act of rushing from the room, while the aston ished father, con, mother and others were confronted by as hard a looking personage as one can sea outside of a penitentiary. The situation was grasped by the head of the family, who seized the demoralized and drunken intruder by the nock and gave him such a righteous pounding that he will have occasion to remember it as long as he lives. As related by the lady in question, the presence cf the intruder, a drunken loafer and sneak thief named Carl An derson, was discovered as follows: Preparatory to retiring she made her toilet in a room adjoining the sleeping apartment, which contained a stove and fire. On going into her sleeping room she observed that the coverlid was tamed down, but as a fa vorite family dog was sometimes in the habit of romping' on the bed, the occurrence ex cited no particular alarm. In turning down the bed clothing, however, the lady was al most paralyzed with fear at beholding a man curled up in tho bed with his hat and clothes on, drunk and fast asleep. She screamed for help, and the rest is known. An investigation showed that the wretch had ascended a pair of stairs in the rear of the house, cut two panes from the sash, and thus entered the room.. He evidently in tended to commit burglary, but being too drunk to carry out his intentions, fell asleep. After his richly merited punishment he evidently crawled into a hole and drew the vacuum in after him. Jewelry and Silver-Flated Ware.

The committee not being ready to make its re port at that hour a further recess was taken till 1:30 , Soon after reassembling Private Secretary W. X.' Rogers appeared and delivered the message ef the President, and it was read. The reading of the message was concluded at 3 o'clock, and it was ordered printed, when, on motion of Senator Wallace, the Sen ate adjourned until 12 to-morrow. House of Representatives. Washington, Dec. C—The convening of Congress always attracts to the capital a large number of sight-seers. Before 12 o'clock noon the galleries filled with spectators. Oa the floor tho members exchanged congratulations. At exactly noon the speaker called the House to order. Rev. Mr. Harrison offered prayer and the roll was called. The number of members present was 227. Jonathan Scoville, member from tha Thirty-second New York district, took the iron-clad oath of office. After the appointment of the customary com mittees to notify the Senate and President of readiness for business, the speaker called the States for bills and resolution?, and Mr. Calk ins, of Indiana, introduced a resolution recit ing the allegation that there are in the Wash ington postoflica certain bags of mail matter which were attempted to be sent through the malls under a frank, although they did not contain frankable matter, and calling on the postmaster general for reports of all acts re- % lating to the detention of such matter.

' By Mr. Kurd, of Ohio, a joint resolution rela tive to the tariff. It declares that legislation on tariff should be governed by the following principles: First, that the tariff is a tax on im ported goods, which is ultimately paid by the consumer. Second, tariff protection, so-called, does not in most cases protect the interest it pretends to. Third, a protective tariff docs not increase the wages of working men. Fourth, a protective tarriff builds up one citizen at the expense of another. Fifth, a protective tariff disturbs the law of trade which governs ex changes by supply and demand. Sixth, that the protective tariff has driven American com merce from the high seas. Seventh, that protection increases tho probability of the arime of smuggling, . /;!:.-: Mr. Bicknell, ot Indiana, asked if it was in order to cake up, at this time, the Senate joint resolution prescribing a method of counting electoral votes. Mr. Kcifer, of —"Why call it up now?" Mr. Bicknell—"For the purpose of voting upon it." Pending action the President's message was received and read. At first the message was listened to with some attention, but after a few pages had been read the members generally entered into con versation and but few followed the reading to the end. The reading occupied two hours. The message was referred to the committee of the whole. Mr, ' Bickell again endeavored to call up the Senate joint resolution proposing » joint rule for counting electoral votes, consideration of which had been postponed until to-day. Mr. Weaver raised the point of order that to day being Monday the gentlemen could not take the floor and prevent members moving to support rules. The speaker ruled that a motion to suspend the rules was one of the privileges. He wished, however, that the question be permitted to lie over for to-day, so as to afford him an oppor tunity to inquire whether the joint resolution prevented a question of privilege. Mr. Conger objected to that course. He did not desire any continuing orders. Mr. Cox, of New York—"Give us a vote on it." Mr. Conger—"No." Mr. Becknell demanded a decision of ques lion as to whether his joint resolution present ed a question of privileges. . Mr. Conger moved to adjourn,pending whioh Mr. Briggs announced the death of his col league, Mr. E. W. Farr and the House ad journed. MATTEBS DEFERRED. Tho Senate joint resolution not' being a con tinuing order cannot come up to-morrow ex cept ah a privileged question -, but the speaker will undoubtedly be oalled upon to decide that question. The following is a resolution Mr. Weaver desired to offered to-day: Whereas, Grave abuses exist in the man agement of - commerce between the States, whereby the producing and shipping interests of tde country are constantly com pelled to pay most unjust and exorbitant rates for transportation. Therefore— Resolved, That in the judgment of this House it is the duty of the general government to at once exercise its constitutional rights to regulate commerce between tho States by. the passage of such laws, and establishing suoh regulations as will secure to the whole people just and impartial rate* for tho transportation of both freight and passengers.

He also to-day received the certificates of the vote of the electoral colege of Maryland at the hands of its messenger. but WHEBE'S miles? It is stated in army circles to-night that it has been determined to place Brigadier Gener als Howard and O. C. Ord, of the department of Texas, on the retired list, and that Briga dier General Christopher C. Augur has been assigned to the department of Texas, and Col. Henry J. Hunt, Fifth artillery, is placed temporarily in charge of the department of the South, vacated by Gen. Augur. THE ATTOBNEI GENERAL. The annual report of the attorney general was presented to Congress to-day. Referring to the election law? the attorney general says: While I believe there has been a steady pro gress of sentiment in favor of the election laws of tbo United States and of their honest execution, and while in certain portions of the United States the Congressional elections have been peacefully and honestly conducted where heretofore there has been just cause for com plaint, yet information from many districts ha* satisfied me that the recent Congressional elections were there accompanied by snch open violations ■. of , the law and such gross frauds as -to demand the attention of Congress, and perhaps addi tional legislation. Meetings assembled for the peaceful advocacy of candidates have been re peatedly Broken up entirely or invaded by bands of armed ruffians. In some instances public avowal has been made of the intention thus to act and public invitations to that effect given, while no effort wai made by the local authorities to prevent such outrages. Violence and intimidation are not reported to have oc curred, however, to the extent that prevailed in the elections of 1874 and 1878. I respect fully submit to the consideration of Congr?sa whether the time has not now arrived when an election law should be passed which shall take into control of United States offloials ail elec tions for members of Congress. - 

DISTBIBUTION OF THE MESSAGE. While the President's message was bo well guarded at the printing office and executive mansion as to prevent its premature publica tion, the management of the post office depart, ment in its distribution throughout the west and southwest, was inexcusably negligent and shameful, thus entailing on the press unnec essary expense and provoking delays. Pains were taken at tho White House to notify pest master Ainger of what would be expected, and that officer sent a special messenger to take charge of the mailing department aboard of trains Saturday forenoon, but it would seem that after the packages were received on the car, the re quest of the President that these press pack ages should be considered a part of the later mail was disregarded, and they were handled as ancient public documents. The careless ness in local postoffices was also extraordinary. To overcome this blundering required tho transmission of f-omo fifty private messages, and of the entire message to tome points, among which may be mentioned Milwaukee as the meat important. Hereafter the associated press will confine its service to the telegraphic lines and express companies. SUPBSIE COUBT DECIBIOKO. No. 83. James 6. Finch & Co., appellants, vs. the United States; appeal from the court of claims. This was a suit brought by Fitch & Painter, a firm of{distillersjin Pittsburgh, to re cover from the United States the sum of $4, --150, which plaintiffs paid for two of Tice's me ters, to be attached to their distilleries in com pliance with orders from the commissioner of internal revenue. The plaintiffs allege that the meters were never inspected or put in working order by any officer of the government; that they wore never attached to their distiller ies in spch a way an to be of use, and that they were afterward found to be entirely worthless for the purposes for which they were intended, and their nae everywhere abandoned. The appellants farther allege that they bonght the meters upon an implied warranty ef the United States that they would be effectual, and that since there has been a clear breach of this warranty the United States is liable. The court, however, holds that there is nothing in the facts from which a contract, expressed or implied, be tween the government and complainants, can be inferred; that the government did not sell the meters or take pay for them, and that it mads no pecuniary difference whether the meters worked or not. Judgment of the court of claims affirmed. . PAGE Rl LEY. A Change of Venue Granted to Another Justice In Dexter Tillage. (Special Telegram to the Globe, j Dexter, Minn., Dec. —The prisoner, counsel, spectators and reporters arrived here at 6 p.m., and after supper proceedings were begun by the defense on a motion for a change of venue on the grounds of preju dice and bias. The court is the same as be fore, Justice Gaskill presiding, but with the addition of John A. Lovely, of Albert Lea, county attorney of Frceborn county, and D. B. Johnson, Sr., of Austin, the former assist ing Judge Page in the prosecution and the lat ter assisting the defense, temporarily. After quoting tho law in the matter both of the counsel for the prosecution withdrew an objection to the motion, and after a moment's deliberation, tho motion was granted, and the case removed to Justice O. F. Kelly, of tho village. The order of the court commands the officer to retain the prisoner In charge, and to present him forthwith to the said Justice Kelly for further proceedings. The court pro ceeded to take a transcript of the previous records, and further proceedings will no doubt be postponed until to-morrow. THE GLOBE HOROSCOPE. As It Oasts Its Light ob the Chicago Markets. * [Special Telegram to the Globe. ] Chicago, Dec. 6.—Foreign advices were dull and lower this morning, but they arrived long after the opening. Ocr market opened strong and higher, with lively trading, but when the lower cables arrived the bears opened their batteries and broke the market two cents a bushel, from $1.07)4, January, to $I.Us>£. The ecene was a very lively one, and the day has been one of great excitement, wheat closing dull this afternoon at $1.05% January. Corn was higher early, bat closing weak at Satur day's prices. Oats held firm. Provisions active, but closing a shade lower than Satur day. The whole list acts very shaky, and the bears are jubilant. More anon. ;,. ' Toy Books, Toy Books. Grand lot of them, just what the children want, at the 99 Cent Store, Bridge Square. A Contemptible Contemporary. ;-?v>. Twenty-four hours after the Globe had given to the public a correct account of the burning of a quantity of wood on the rail road track at the foot of Robert street, the misnomer printed on Third street substi tutes bad taste to make up for its Jack of en terprise and prints a maliciously false ac count of the ' occurrence. The account un justly reflects on the fire department, and for this reason the latter should be set right. The facts are these: The ire started about S o'clock Sunday morning, a few minutes after whioh the members of No. 1 were ap prised of what was going on. They started at once for the scene of the fire, the burning car at that time being a part of a train that was stationed just below the bridge. On reaching the fire it was seen that No. 1 hose did not have sufficient pipe to reach the car. A messenger was at once sent to hose house No. 2 for reinforcements to remedy this defect. Meantime, the members of No. 1 went to work, detached the car and ran it down the Crack to keep the other cars from taking fire. They went to work and threw the burning wood from the car, and the fire could have been put out without the use of water. While they were thus engaged, some one unnecessarily turned in an alarm from box No. 16, which brought out the de partment. A s stream was put on the wood, which had been unloaded, and the fire was completely extinguished. But how csuld the P. P. know anything about the facts when it wasn't there. THE TREASURY. Extracts from the Report of Secretary Sherman—Foreshadowing* of the Finan cial Policy of the Garfleld Admlolstra- Hostility to the Standard Silver Dol lar and the Legal Tender Quality of Greenbacks—Three-Sixtr-Flve Bonds and Notes Recommended fir Redemption Purposes. The annual report of the secretary of tLo treasury, in addition to the tabular and other statements copied into the President's mes sage, includes the following comparison and estimates for (be current fiscal year: Compared with the previous fiscal year, the receipts for 1880 have increased $62,029,438.23. The expenditures show an increase over the : previous year of $25,190,360.48. For the present fiscal year the revenue, ac tual and estimated, ia as follows: For the quarter ended September 30, 18S0, actual, $97,889,239.92. For the remaining three-quarters of the year, estimated, $252 - 110,760.08. The expenditures for the same period, actual and estimated, are: For the quarter ended September 30, 1880, actual, $77,018,531.78. For the remaining three-quarters of the year, estimated, $182,981, 408.22. Total receipts, actual * and es timated $350,000,000 00" Total expenditures, actual and estimated 260,000,000 00 Surplus $90,000,000 00 Estimated amount due the sinking fund.... 39 801,884 48 /. " , Leaving a balance of $50,198,115 52 Under the act of February 25, 1862, as amend ed July 14,1870, the sinking fund at date of this report is short $51,344,594.35, or nearly the same amount as the balance of estimated receipts over the estimated expenditures, as shown above. Thus it is probable that there can be applied to the purchase of bonds for the sinking fund during the present fiscal year an amount sufficient to cover the whole deficiency now existing on the account of that fund, thus making good the whole amount of the sinking fund as required by law. Upon the basis of existing laws the secretary estimates the revenues of the fiscal year end ing June 30,1U82, at $350,000,000, while the estimates from the several departments of amounts required for the year, including the sinking fund, foot up $301,554,722.28, leaving an estimated surplus of $48,445,277.72. Excluding the sinking fund, the estimated ex penditures will be $259,914,882.08, showing a surplus of $90,085,117.92. The large surplus revenues (actual and esti mated) for the fiscal years 1880, '81 and'B2, the secretary submts as naturally presenting to "the question whether the surplus revenue ac cruing after the present year should be applied to the further reduction of the public debt, or whether taxes now imposed should bo re pealed or modified to the extent of such sur pins. The many and sudden changes that have heretofore occurred in the amounts realized from our system of taxation are a sufficient warning that revenue should not be surrendered units* it satisfactorily ap pears that the surplus is permanent, and not merely temporary. If the taxes imposed by existing laws are not oppressive in their na ture, it is perhaps better to bear with them than to endanger the ability of the govern ment to meet the current appropriations and the sinking fund." * * * If it should be determined by Congress to reduce taxes, it is respectfully recommended that all the taxes imposed by the internal revenue law other than those on bank circulation and on spirits, tobacco, and fermented liquors be repealed. A large portion of the outstanding public debt ($687,850,600) becomes payable or re deemable on or before July 1, next. '-The surplus revenue accruing prior to July 1,1881, estimatedj at about fifty million dollars, (50,000.000.) will be applied under existing law to the purchase or payment of the bonds above described, thus leaving the sum of $637,350,600 to be provided for. * * * Under existing law, there is still available for this purpose four per cent, bonds author ized by the act* of July 14, 1870, and January 20 1871, if the amount of $104,652,200. These could now be Bold at a large premium, and in j the absence of legislation, it would be the duty of the secretary when any bonds became redeemable, to Bell the four per cents and apply the proceeds to the redemption of such bonds; but the amount of four per cents authorized 13 inadequate to the purpose stated. * * » Hitherto the policy has been to sell bonds bearing as low a rate of interest as possible, running a number of years, but in view of the requirements of the sinking fund, it is believed that a large por tion of the public debt to bo redeemed can bo provided for by treasury notes. • * * The large accumulation of money now seeking investment affords a favorable opportunity for selling such notes bearing a low rate of interest. It is believed that they will form a popular security, always available to the holder, and readily convertible into money when needed for other investment or business. They should be in such form and denominations as to furnish a convenient in vestment for the small savings of the people, and fill the place designed by tho ten-dollar refunding certificates authorized by the act of February 26, 1879." * *. * * * The secretary, therefore, recommends that provision be made for the issue of an amonat not exceeding $400,000,000 of treasury notes in denominations not less than ten dollars, bear ing interest not exceeding four per cent, per annum, and running from one to ten years, to be sold at not less than par, the amount ma turing during any year not to exceed the sink ing-fund for ihat year, and the proceeds to be applied to the payment of five and six per cent, bonds, maturing in 1881. It in believed that, with the present favorable state of the money market, a sufficient amount of such treasury notes bearing an annual interest of three per cent. , can be sold to meet a consider able portion of the maturing bonds; but it is better to confer upon the department a discre tionary power to stipulate for a higher maxi mum rate, to avoid the possibility of failure. Such a discretion is not likely to be abused, while a power too carefully restricted may de feat the beneficial object of tho law. 

THBKE-SIXTT-FTVE BONDS. "It is also recommended that . anthority be given to sell at par an amount not exceeding $400,060,000 of bonds of the character and de scription of the four per cent, bonds of the United States now outstanding, but bearing a rate of interest not exceeding three and sixty five one-hundredths per cent, per annum, and redeemable at the pleasure of the United States after fifteen years,the proceeds to be applied to the payment of bonds redeemable, on or be fore July 1,1881. Though the amount of the two classes of securities recommended exceeds the amount of bonds to be redeemed, bo more can be sold than the bonds to be redeemed, while the alternative authorized will permit a limit discretion to sell the securities most fa vorable the government." 

GREENBACKS. "United States notes are now, inform, se curity and convenience, the best circulating medium known. * * * The loss of in terest in maintaining the resumption fund and the cost of printing and engraving the present amount of United States notes is less than one half the interest on an equal sum of four per cent, bonds. The public thus saves over $7,000,000 of annual interest and secures a safe and convenient medium of exchange, and has the assurance that a sufficient reserve in coin will bo retained in the treasury beyond the temptation of diminution, such as always attends reserves held by banks." • * , * "As the quality of legal-tender was attached to these notes when first Issued, and was then essential to their value and cir culation, the public mind is sensitive when any proposition is made that by possibility might impair their valuo, but it is their re demption in coin that makes them now equal to coin and of ready circulation in all the marts of tho world. While this is maintained it becomes comparatively, immaterial whether they are a legal-tender or not, and if by the ac lion of Congress or the courts they are depriv ed of this quality they will still be the favorite money of tho people." 

GOLD IMPOSTS. "The gold imported at New Nork, during the earlier part of the last fiscal year, seceded the capacity of the Philadelphia mint for coinage, with its ordinary working force, without in curring expenses much above the specific ap propriations for its support. * * * • The mint was able, with its other work, to coin in gold an amount little exceeding on the average $2,000,000 per month, but thin was found suf ficient to satisfy the immediate demands upon it for coin. At the close of the year there re mained in tho mints and Now York assay office $40,724,337.91, in gold bullion uncoined nearly all of it imported." THE SILVER DOLLAS.' While at special seasons of the year, and for special purposes, this coin is in demand, main ly in the South, it returns again to the treasury and its reissue involves an expense for trans portation at an [average rate of one-third of one per cent, each time. * * * First, it is I too bulky for large transactions, and its nee is ; confined mainly to payments for manual labor and for market purposes or for change. The amount needed for these purposes is already in ; excess of the probable demand. Second, it is known to contain a quantity of silver of lens market value than the gold in gold coin. This fact would not impair the circula tion of such limited amount as ex perience shows to be convenient for use, but it doss prevent its being held or hoarded as reserves, or exported, and pushes it into ac tive circulation, until its return to the treas ury, as the least valuable and desirable money in use. For these reasons the secretary re spectfully but earnestly recommends that the further compulsory coinage of the silver dol lar be suspended, or, as an alternative, that the number of grains of eilver in the [dollar be in creased so as to make it equal in market value to the gold dollar, and that its coinage be left as other coinage to the secretary of the treas ury or the director of the mint, to depend upon o&SSSS? tor * by tho PQbllc for -°™ie" As to the fractional silver coinp.ge the recrc tary says: It would teem wise that the excess not needed for chan?»shonld bo coined into standard dollars, and that any further frac tional coin, hereAfter needed, should contain silver of approximate . relative vslne to tb' standard coin. 

NATIONAL BAn The capital stock of the national baoka on October 1, 1880, was $457,553,550; surplus $120,518,583; and the total emulation out standing, $343,919,863. National banks are organized in every State of the Union except Mississippi, nad in every Territory except Arizona; and tho total nura her in operation in 2,005, which is the neatest number that has been in operation at any one time. * *  Jkj; ca Pila stock of the national banks h n^n>^n >? 00183andthe fiarlua nearly $14, --000.000 less than at the corresponding dato in 1870. The loans of the banks at the date of their last returns were $1,037,000,000 and the individual deposits $873,000,000. the highest points reached since the organization of" the system, the loans being 5207.000,000 greater and the individual deposits $253,000 000 crest - er than in October. 1878, while the capital and surplus at the previous date were $5,000,000 in excess of their present amount?, t The tables given by the comptroller show that during the past two years the loans of the banks in the city of New York have been ex tended to a much greater degree proportion ably than the loans in other parts of the coun try, and that the cash reserves of t£o banks ia New York have been unprectdentedly low. The enormous increase of individual and bank deposits during the last year should not be accompanied with a proportional increase of loan, eince such increase would it is believed, have the effect, indirectly, of in creasing the market prices of many railroad and other stocks and bonds largely beyond their actual value. The bank* in New i'ork City hold more than $100,000,000 of the funds of other banks, which are payable on demand and it is of the greatest importance that they should at all times exhibit great strength if they would keep themselves in condition for an adverse balance of trade, and for the legiti mate demands of those dealers who confide in them. THE 

TARIFF, -7™>..'. The present tariff is bnt a compilation r.f laws passed during many succeeding years and to meet the neccsaitic a of the government from time to time. Tho general principle upon which they are founded in believed t«> be wise and salutary. No marked or sudden chanse, which would tend to destroy or injnrr: domestic industries built upon faith in the stability of existing laws, should be cade in them. Change*, however, have occur red in the value of some ar ticles, caused mainly by important inventions and improvements in the mode of manufacture. These have produced irregular ities and incongruities in the rales of taxation so that on some articles the duties have be ' como prohibitory, while en others tha nit* of taxation ia too low. Some duties ad valorem might, with the experience ac quired under existing laws, be converted into specific duties. Many articles which do net compete with domestic industry, end yield but a small amount of revenue, might be added to the free list. EXPORTS HMD IMPORTS. j • The import of merchandise for tna peat year exceeded such imports during any previous year in the history of the country. Ihe IcEd ing articles, showing marked increase in quan tity or value imported, are coffee, bides and skins, raw silk, and tea, all of which tre free of duty, and copper, manufacture aof cotton silk, and wool, fruits, glass, iron and steel, lead, leather, precious stonea, leaf tobacco, wool, and zinc. The imports of unmanufac tured wool increased from 39,C00,C00 pounds in 1879 to over 128,000,000 pounds ia ISBO. The value of the imports of railroad-bars of iron and steel increased from $70,071 in 1 *7'» to $4,952,286 in 1860, OCRAK CAEBSTKG mum The disproportion between the connicdiii-?* carried in American and those carried i a Tor eign vessels still continues, and is even greater than during tho fiscal year 1879, the amonnt of merchandise transported in our vise's during the fiscal year 1880, estimated on a basis of value, being rive per cent, less than thai trans ported during tho former year. The foreign carrying trade in American bottoms is more than fifty per cent, less than it has been, or than it mi;jht be, and if it is desirable to save the country the annnal freightage on merchandise of the value of twelve hundred millions of dollars, the only coutsa to reach that ret nit would seem to bo o increase our registered chipping. * + * Doubtless the number of vessels of hcmc-buili will be adequate in time to take up the freight age lost to American bottoms in consequence of tha war of the rebellion. At present, how ever, the demand for vessel-: to carry <•: cur immense import and export trade do) not Beerajto so stimulate the building industry as to prevent an accual decrease in the number of ships built. The present facilities for freighting in foreign vessels appear to be great er discouragement to that industry than would be the privilege of purchasing each vessels. The bulk of the report, other than above given, is a^repetition of the beads of division and services under the secretary of the treas ury, abstracts of which havo bsen poblislMd during the past two weeks.
