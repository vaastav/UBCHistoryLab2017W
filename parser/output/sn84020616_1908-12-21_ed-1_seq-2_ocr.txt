If Castro ever intends to return to Brazil, It would be best for him to wait until he can go in spirit only. Pulitser aays he is a chronic invalid. Maybe that's why the New Tork ITorld always haa a grouch on the editorial page? There la some comfort in the thought that no matter how rich you Bight be, you wouldn't have half enough money for Christmas anyhow.

I Wednesday Afternoon the Theater will be STILL FEAR T He Can Do a Great Many Things In the Short Time Before He Retires. Washington, Dr-c. 21 A lot of p"o- ple grow uneasy when they, contem plate the things it Is possible for Theodore lloosevelt dj during the ese than three months that remain of his adminiitliaUon. Already a con siderable number of Congressrmn are n the slough of despond because ot the executive order placing lu.ouU fourth class postmasters under the protection of the civil service laws, and there is every reason to believe the order will be extended to cover the remaining 2j,000 fourth cla.1 of fices. And there is a disquieting re port from the White House that the president has In mind tlu placing ot some 20.000 other officers under the civil service. Including deputy mar shals, deputy surveyors, deputy col lectors, assistant district attorneys, tc. Already f.r all practical purposes consular appointments have bevn re moved from the class of Cungrcssion- a. patronage, and should . the presi dent carry out the program. he is re ported to have under consideration senators and representatives will have left to them no more patronage than has the resident commissioner from Porto Itleo, who has no nay In the distribution of offices beyond trie ap pointment of his personal sccretaiy. Steven out of ten members of Con gress then will be ready to get u' and declare that "a foul outrage haa been perpetrated." The other three in ten possess unbounded satisfaction at the prospect. That's because there is a difference of opinion. The seven who feel outraged hold to the bdicl that the patronuge a member has to distribute makes him more friendl than it does enemies and enables him to hold on to his scat in Congress The other three believe a man make more enemies than friends through the distribution of patronage anu don't want to be bothered with offlce stwkers, anyhow. Mostly, such a those belong to the "high brow" ciu.f of statesmen, who don't like even to send out garden seeds. Army and navy officers ef long ser vice constitute another class who arc ill at ease. The rumor la perslsteni In circles of the service that the pres ident proposes wholesale retirement' some time b' 'tween now and March 4. Mr, Roosevelt has repeatedly gone on record as favoring younger men In the higher ranks of the army an'. navy, and as the law provides tha. the president may, "in his discretion' retire an officer who has reached the age of 62 years or been 4:1 years in the service under a commission it Is only natural to expect that while pow er yet remains in his hands he will do something to put his theories into araetlce. In the army two mtjor generals four brigadier generals and more th in thirty colonels and lieutenant colonelB have pas-cd or are very close to t ie age o' t'i. V of them are subject to retirement hy order of the coni-niHnier-ln-eh!ef Th- ir retirem nt would furnish an opportunity for the I promotion of meritorious young offi cers which must appeal powerful'y to I the president. Nor is there any cer tainty that these promotions wou'd be made according to seniority. There no law compelling the- pris'dent to J observe the time-honored rule of seniority, and he has Ignored it in a 'number of very notable Instances. The cases of (ieneial Wood, now com manding the department of the- east and ; neral Crozler. chief of the ord nance bureau, are IKtivtratlons. The nay dots not afford so many opportunities for retir. ments bu' there are quite numlnT of officers eligible to Involuntary relief from active duty who are not ready to quit, and they Jump at every unusual noise. Prospective retirements, however, re I not needed to keep the navy In hot j water. The reorganization of that (branch of the service which the presi 1 IM S dent already has under way is sufn 

FINEST MOTION PICTURES AND LATEST ILLUSTRATED AND SPOT LIGHT SONGS and every lady who HANDSOME dent to engage all the spare attention of naval officers. That during the present session of Congrece there are going to be a num ber of Interesting exchanges between the White House and the capitol goes wl;hout saying. Theodore ftoosevelt has personal and very pronounc d v.ews regarding Congress, and con gress Is not without its specific and not always favorable views of Theo dore Roosevelt. In the past there have been considerations, political and otherwise, whivh made it advisa ble that there be mutual restraint in the expression of these views. The-e considerations are now largely re moved, and the country may settle down to have a good time observing the exchanges of "hot shot." The president led oft wi;h that little- paragraph In his annual message about members of Congress being afraid of the sctlvitles of the treasury secret service, and Congress was not slow to resolve upon a counter bljw. As there are not likely to be any serious casualties, let the war pro ceed merrily. The naval committees of Congress do not seem any more disposed than tWey were last winter to agree with the president upon the necessity of authorizing the construction of four battleships a year. The program is advocated again In the presidents message and in the annual report of the secretary of the navy, but the vet erans of the nasal committees and In the .Senate aniJHouse remain unim pressed. It Is true that there is today a larger number than ever before of In dividual members of Congress who favor a larger program of naval con struction, but they are well nigh powerless so long as the naval com miu es remain as now organized. o Kr the best work on unlit waist ustronlae Itnhhs linrutrr Cn r.ei & a Account Christmas and New years Holidays Tickets will be sold to points on A.
