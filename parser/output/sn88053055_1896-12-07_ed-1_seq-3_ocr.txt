WILL IGNORE THE DINGLEY BILL. The Republicans Will Probably Call Extra Hesson of Congress for March 10. Chairman linnna Now a Central Figui In Washington. Washington, Dec. 7.—Vico Prosldont Stevenson called the senate to order at today. The first day of tho session will bo devoted almost entirely to receiv ing the president's messuge. Immedi ately uftor the opening prayer committees appointed to notify tho president and the house of representatives that tho senate was organized and ready to receive communications and proceed with busl If precedents are followed there will be un adjournment soon after tho celpt of the president's message. The first week of the session is not pected to bo productive of any Important results in a legislative way. There many senators who think that but little nothing should bo done beyond the passage of the appropriation bills at this session, and as these measuros necessarily originate in tho house there will l>e a dis position to potftpono the season of activity until some of these bills can bo received from tho other end of tho Capitol. The probabilities are that the daily sessions at the boginning will bo comparatively brief, and thut the senate will content itself with four days' work each week. Tho calendar presents a wide range of material for consideration in case the sen ate shows a disposition to busy itself. In this Is included tho immigration bill, which is the "unfinished business," tho Pacific railroad refunding bill, the state hood bills and the Dingloy tariff and bond bills, as well us the Cuban and Hawaiian questions. Senators Lodge and Chandler have nounced their determination to press tho immigration bill to a vote as speedily as they can. It will be the first regular busi ness to bo tukon up and cannot be dis placed except by vote or unanimous sent. They hope to get the bill through before the holidays. It is also possible that the president's message may suggest sub jects for speeches, and there ure those who predict that the Cuban question will ceive vigorous attention from tho begin ning of tho session. It is generally agreed that the Ropubll will hold a caucus to determine upou a line of policy, especially with reforouco to the tariff, and until after tho oxchango of vlows which this conference will per mit no step is likely to be taken which will commit the party to any position any question of political significance. The opening week promises to see the house put Its shoulder to tho wheel of tho regular appreciation bills. Chairman Cannon und the committee on appropria tions were at work all lust week, and it is their earnest intention to pass two and possibly three of the bills before the Christ holidays. The pension and lcgisla ;udy, the other of those will tive appropriation bills und work be begun lu the house before the week closes. The pension bill, although it ries a larger uinount of mouoy than of the other supply bills, is very brief, and unless cipitated is not likely to oonsumo much" In its consideration. Beyond those two bills nothing Is in sight at present. It is, of course, not rules will abi political discussion is pro li likely that the committee provide something for tho house to do in appropriations is not propared to go ahead with either of those appropriation bills. The c the legislation, the committee •so of fur ns the important the calendar Is concerned (like tho Pacific railroad funding bill, the Nicaragua canal bill, etc ), will bo de termined entirely by the rules commlttoe. But it is safe to assume that nothing will be allowed to take the placo of the appro priation bills ns they are reported for ac tion. They always hnvo the right of way at tho short session. It is unanimously conceded that the Re publican program is to ignore tho Dingloy tariff bill, and to summon an extra session of the Fifty-fifth congros9 for tho 15th of March for the purpose of passing a new tariff measure, so theso features of tho sit uation which have absorbed the attention of politicians recently have coasod to lie of interest. In their placo come tho cabinet predictions. A coutral figure is Mr. Marcus A. Hanna, who is looked upon here as the ad vance agont of tho McKinloy administra tion, with a commission to feel tho pulse of congress und to communicate the pol icy of tho prosident-elect to the leaders. When Mr. Han on appeared In the Arling ton lobby yesterday, II. Pay no, of Wise n cabinet probability: C. J. Dawes, of Chicago, a member of the Republican committee, und General Horace Porter, tho marshal of tho inauguration parade, rroundod by congress men and other politicians, who them to Mr. Hanna's rooms.

Chairman Babcock and Vice Chairman Morcer, of tho c grossionul campaign committee, and Gcn •, of Ohio. With most of his callers Mr. Hanna did much listening and littlo talking. The chief purpose of his visit is to make pre liminary arrangements for tho inaugura tion ceremonies. Regarding the position of chairman of tho inauguration commit tee which lias boon tendered to Mr. S. W. Woodward, a prominent business man of this city, Mr. Hanna said: "Mr. Wood ward will give a definite answor boforo night. He fears that the duties of tho po sition would take •companied by C.
