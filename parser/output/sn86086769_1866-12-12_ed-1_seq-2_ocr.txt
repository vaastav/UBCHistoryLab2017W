THE JTRIBUNE. nnEBAL POINT : WEDNESDAY, DECEMB3R 12, ISG6. President’s Messare. TTe give this document to our read ers in an extra this week. "We had made arrangements for laying it be fore our readers at an earlier cay, but was disappoi ited in receiving it in time. Asa literary production the Mes sage is a very fair state paper. Its style is in advance of any ether document we have seen from the nen of Mr. John'Sov. Ihe President, it will be seen adheres to his “ Policy” with the tenacity of one who believes himself right, and unwilling to be convinced to tie contrary. lie advances no thing new upon the su : ject. and his reiteration of his oft ex ress< i views will have little weight with Congress since the people have so unanimously pronounced a preference for the course pursued by C ongress in c "o sltion to that of the President. In fact, the devotion of one-th'.rd of ].. message to petti; ..is own .
