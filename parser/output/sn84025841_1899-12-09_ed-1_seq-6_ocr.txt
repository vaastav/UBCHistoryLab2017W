PRESIDENTS I To tarro Senate and House of Repre? sentatives: Tho Fifty-sixth congress c*~mvenes is its first regular session with the coun? try te a condition of unusual pros? perity, of universal good will among the people at home, and in relations of peace and friendship with every gov? ernment of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great Increase in volume and value. The combined im? ports and exports for the year are the largest ever shown by a single year te all our history. Our exports for 1899 alone -exceeded by more than a billion dollars our imports and ex? ports combined in 1870. The imports per capita are SO per cent less than in 1S70. while the -exports per capita are SS per cent mon- than In 1870, show? ing the enlarged capacity of the Uni? ted States to satisfy the wants of its own Increasing population, as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of other nations. Exports of agricultural products were fTo4.776.142. Of manufactured products we exported In value $339. S92.146, being larger than any pre? vious year. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years In all our history when the products of our manufac? tories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1S98 and 1399 Government receipts from all sources "for the fiscal year ended June 30. 1899. including $1*1.798.311.14. part payment of the Central Pacific railroad indebt? edness, aggregated $fil0.982.004.orV Cus? toms receipts were $206.1-28.481.75. and those from Internal revenue $273,437. 161.61. For the fiscal vear the expenditures -were 

S70O.O93.664.O2, leavla-g a deficit of $89.1ll.r359.?7. The secretary of the treasury esti? mates that the receipts for the cur? rent fiscal year will aggregate $640. 958.112. and upon t*he basis of present appropriations the expenditures will aggregate $600,958.11*2. leaving a sur? plus of $40,000,000. For tne fiscal year ended June SO. 1899. the internal revenue receipts were increased about t100.000.000. The present gratifying strength of the treasury is shown by the fact that on Dec. 1. i899. the available cash bal? ance was $278,004,837.72. of which $239,744,905.36, was in gold coin and bullion. The conditions of confidence which prevail throughout the coun? try have brought poid into more gen? eral use and customs receipts are now almost entirely paid In that coln. The strong position of the treasury with respect to cash on hand and the favorable showing made by the reve? nues have made lt possible for the secretary of the treasury to take action under the provisions of Section 3.694 Revired Statues, relating to the sink? ing fund. Receipts exceeded expendi? tures for the first five months of th* current fUcal year by $13,413,389.91 and. as mentioned above, thu sr ?>t the treasury estimates that ther* will be a surplus of approximately $40. 000,000 at the end of the year. Unriei such conditions it was deemed advis >?ble and proper to resume compliant with the provisions ot the siukin? *-tund law. which for eight years ha; not been done, beeause of deflc'eneiei in the revenues. The treasury "xnent. therefore, offered to purchas during November $25,000,000 of thc per cent loan of 1904. or the 4 per cen funded loan of 1907 at the onrren market price. The amount offered an< purchased during November waa $18, 408,600. The premium paid by the gov ernment on such purchases was $2 263.521 and the net saving In Interes waa about $2,885,000. The success c this operation was sufficient to indue the government to continue the one to purchase bonds to and Including th 23d day of December. Instant, unle the remainder of the $25,000,000 calle for should be presented In the meai time for redemption. In Its earlier history the nations hanking act seemed to prove a reasoi able avenue through which necdfi additions to the circulation could fro time to time be made. Channin? coi ditlons have apparently rendered now inoperative to that end. The hit* margin in bond securities required, r suiting from large premiums whit -government bonds command in tl market, or the tax on note issues, "both operating together, appear to 'the Influences which impair Its pub! utility. ' The attention of congress ls respec fully invited to this important matti with the view of ascertaining wheth Or not such reasonable modification c "Tbe made In the national banking t as will render its service in the partlc lars here referred to more responsl **to the people's needs. I again ur that the national banks be authoria to organize with a capital of $25,000 I urgently recommend that to st port the existing gold standard and maintain "the parity in value of i coins of the two metals (gold and i -Ter) and the equal power of evi dollar at all times in tha market t in the payment of debts," the sec tary of the treasury be given additi al power and eharged with the d to sell United States bonds and to < ploy such other effective means may be necessary to these ends. ' authority should include the power. sell bonds on long and short time conditions may require, and she provide for a rate of Interest lo than that Axed by the act of Jan. 1875. While there is now no e mercial fright which withdraws j from the government, but, on the < trary, such widespread confidence gold seeks the treasury demant paper money in exchange, yet the ? situation points to the present as most fitting time to make adeq provision to insure the continuanc the gold standard and of public ci dence in the ability and purposi the government to meet all its obi tions in the money which the civii world recognizes as the best. The financial transactions of government are conducted upon a basis. We receive gold when we United States bonds and use golc their payment. We are maintai the parity of all the money issue coined by authority of the governr We are doing these things with means at hand. Happily at the ent time we are not compelled fa sort to loans to supply gold. Il been done in the past, however, may have to be done in the futur one (he .ii* (d jbuc emergency when 11 ; vises, and the means are those which are the certain and economical. Those authorized have the virtue neith directness nor economy. We hav Teady eliminated one of the cans our financial plight and em' during the years 1893, 1894. 189S 1896. Our receipts now. equal ou penditures; deficient revenues longer create alarm. Let us te the only remaining causes by cc ring the full and "necessary power on ? the secretary of the treasury and \ta~ pose upon him tate duty to uphold the present gold standard, and preserve the coins of tbe two metals on a parity with each other, which ls tao repeatedly declared policy of the Uni? ted States. in this connection I repeat my for? mer recommendations that a portion of the gold holdings .shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenback's shall be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redtemed shall not ?thereafter be paid out except for gold. Valor ot a M**fli*Bt "Marine. The value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our com? mercial trade and the strengthening mrt* our power upon "the sea invites tho Immediate action of <the congress. Our aational development will be one sided and unsatisfactory so long as the rr-rrarkable crowth alf our inland ln dtavstries remains uaiaccompanled by progress on the sea**-. There is no la** of constitutional authority for legislation which ste*ll give to the country maritime strength commen suraae with Its industrial achievements and -with its rank auverng the nations of tn-e earth. The pas* year has re? corded exceptional activity in our ship? yards, and the promise* of continual prosperity in shipbuilding are abund? ant. Advanced legislation for the pro? tection of our seamen has been en? acted. Our coast trade, nuder regula? tions wisely framed at tne beginning of the government nnd striae, shows re? sults for the past fiscal year unequal? ed in our records of those of any other power. We shall fall to realize our opportunities, however, if we com? plaisantly regard only matters at home and blind ourselves to the neces? sity of securing our share In the ral uable carrying trade of the world. IA f* *???!?? ?*r Ota Trust*. Combinations of capital organized Into trusts to control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle com? petition, limit production and deter Btfne the prices of products used and consumed by the people are -justly provoking public discussion, and should early claim the attention of the -congress. The industrial commission, created by the act of the congress of June 18. 1S98. has been engaged In extended hearings upon the disputed questions involved 5n the subject of combina? tions In restraint of trade and com? petition. They have not yet completed their Investigation of this subject, and th* conclusions and recommendations at which they may arrive are unde? termined. lt Is universally conceded that com? binations which engross or control the market of any particular kind of mer? chandise or commodity necessary tc the general community by suppress? ing natural and ordinary competition whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer are obnoxious not only to the common law. but alsc to tbs mi bl lc welfare. There must bt a remedy for tho evils evolved in sucli organizations, lt tba present law car be extended more certainly to con? trol or check thr?e monopolies 01 trusts it should be done without delay Whatever power the congress pos sesses over this most important sub' ject should be promptly ascertainec and asserted. President Harrison's message o: Dec. 3, 1889. is then quoted, and Presi dent McKinley proceeds: An act to protect trade and com merce against unlawful restraints an< monopolies was passed by congress oi the 2d of July, 1S90. The provision of this statute are comprehensive am stringent, lt declares every contrac or combination, in the form of a true or otherwise, of conspiracy in the re Btraint of trade or commerce arnon the several states or with foreign na tiona to be unlawful. It denominate aa a criminal every person who make any such contract or engages in an such combination or conspiracy, an provides a punishment by fine or In prisonment. It further confers upo any person who shall be injured in h business or property by any other pei son or corporation by reason of anj thing forbidden or declared to be ui lawful by the act the power to si therefor in any circuit court of tl United States without respect to tl amount in controversy, and to recovi threefold the damages by him su tained and the costs of the suit. inclu< ing reasonable attorney fees. It w! be perceived that the act is aimed every kind of combination In the n ture of a trust or monopoly in r straint of interstate or Internation commerce. The chapter on trusts closes with quotation from the message of Pre Ident Cleveland of Dec. 7. 1896. deda ing the laws passed for their suppre sion ineffective. President McKinl then urges uniformity of legislation i the p?*trt of the several states. T message proceeds: Our Forr'arn Relation*. A review of our relations with f< eign states is presented with such r< emmendations as are deemed approp ate. The long pending boundary dispi betwen the Argentine Republic a Chile, was settled in March last by I award of an arbitral commission, which the United States minister Buenos Ayres served as umpire. Progress has been made toward conclusion of a convention of extra tion with the Argentine Republic. Il ing been advised and consented to the I'nited States senate and ratified Argentina, it only awaits the adji nient Of some slight changes in text -before exchange. It is gratifying to be able to nounce that the Belgian governm has mitigated the restrictions on importation of cattle from the Un States, to which I referred in my annual message. Having been invited by Belgiun participate in a congress held at Bi sels to revise the provisions of the j eral act of July 2, 1890. for the rep sion of the African slave trade, which the United States was a sig tory party, this government prefei not to be represented by a plenipb tiary. but reserved the right of ac sion to the result. Notable ebal were made, those especially cone ing this country being in the lin the increased restriction of the c terious trade In spirituous liquors ? the native tribes, whieh this gov ment has from the outset urgently vocated The amended general ""itl w1'' be '"-"** before the senate %l ' view to its advice and consent. Early in the year the peace of Bo was disturbed by a successful It rection. The United States min remained at l*js post, attending tc American interests in that quartet using besides his good offices foi protection of the interests of Br subjects In the absence of their tional representatives. Our representative has been inst ed to use all permissabie friendl; deavors to Induce the governmei >n\*or- I ?0-iv-* i0 mtaend its marriage lat in? to :he "11 sry ind re on uty >m as rhe ? to , as mid wer 14. nni ;old *on that ling ? ery the nate ?

Into harmony with the general practice of modern states. Extradition Treat? Wita Mr.iBtl. A convention of extradition with Brazil, signed May 14. 1897. -has been ratified by the Brazilian legislature The claim growing out of the seiz? ure of the American owned -newspa? per, the Panama Star and Herald, by the authorities of Colombia Bias been settled, after a controversy ot several years, tty an agreement assessing at $3u.000 the indemnity to be paid by the Colombian government. The good will of 'Colombia toward our -country bas been testified anew by the cordial entenslom of facilities to the Nica? raguan canal commission. Discussion of the questions raised by the action of Denmark in Imposing restrictions on the importation of American meats haa continued with? out substantial result in our favor President McKinley then refers to ! the assassination of President He-ure aux and the establishment of a new , government in Santo Domingo under . President JJrminez, the feature of the .?Greater Republic of Central America ! (Nicaragua. Honduras and Salvador). . the Bluefield-s outbreak of February last, the declared forfeiture of the j contract of the Maritime Canal com? pany of Nicaragua and the protest of j the company against the action of the Nicaragua government. The dlssolu i tion of the Nicaragua canal commis i sion and the organization of the j Isthmian canal commission under the j presidency of Rear Admiral Walker ls then referred to. and on this sub? ject the president says: The great Importance of this work cannot be too often or too strongly pressed upon the attention of the con? gress. In my message of a year ago | I expressed my views of the necessity i of a canal which would link the two great oceans to which I again invite ? your consideration. The reasons then presented for early action are even I stronger now. Our Interdata la China. After a short chapter on our cor ? dial relations with the government of ChHe the message proceeds to a dis? cussion of our interests in China, as follows: In view of disturbances In the popu '. lous provinces of northern . China, where are many of our citizens, and of the imminence of disorder near the t capital and toward the seaboard, a guard of marines was landed from the Boston and stationed during last win? ter in the legation compound at Pe , king. With the restoration of order . i this protection was withdrawn. Adequate protection has been se j I cured for our missionaries and some ? Injuries to their property have been \ redressed. , I American capital has sought and , found various opportunities of com , peting to carry out the internal im . t provements which the imperial gov . i ernment is wisely encourag. and our trade with China has continued to [ | grow. , | The extension of the area open tc j international foreign settlement al I Shanghai and the opening of the port' f ; of Nanking. Tsing-Tao (Kiao Chao) . : and Ta-Llen-Wan to foreign trade and I settlement will doubtless afford an] . i enterprise additional facilities and nev j j fields, of which it will not be slov 1' to take advantage. B I In my message to conga-ess of Dec j 5, 1898, I urged that the recqmmenda t '? tions which had been made to th t speaker of the house of representative ,_ by the secretary of the treasury on th g 14th of June, 1898, for an appropriatioi . for a commission to study the com !s '? mercial and industrial conditions 1 ,8 the Chinese empire and report as t y i the opportunities for. and obstacles tc 4 ' the enlargement of markets in Chin k. j for the raw products and manufac n tures of the United States, receive 8 IS your hands the consideration whlc r. ? its importance and timeliness meritet ,_ ' but the congress failed to take ac I.

T*"-,ere has beer, allotted to the Ul ted States a considerable addition space, which, while placing our cou try in the first rank among exhibito does not suffice to meet the increi ingly urgent demands of our mac factures. The American exhibit at Pa should, and I am confident will, be on open volume, whose lesson of sk at. fully directed endeavor, unfaltering < j ergy and consummate performai the . may be read by all on every page, tl dj. spreading abroad a clearer knowle av- of the worth of our productions l uy tbe iuHtice of our claim to an impc Dy ,' ant place In the markets of the woi *sl" j I am Informed by our commissioi the j general that we shall have in j American sections at Paris over 7. an" exhibitors from every state in i ent country, a number ten times as gv *"? as 'those which were represented ' , Vienna in 1873, six times as many last those in Paris in 1878, and four til as many as those who exhibited 1 * Paris in 1889. This statement d 'en- -y11 ?nclude tne exhibits from eit res- ^ba, P?rt0 Ri<"? ?"" Hawaii, fer wt arrangements have been made t0 I Our relations with Germany conti 'na* to be most cordial. The increasing rre" . timacy of direct association has t ten" j marked during the year by the gn oe9* lng permission in April for the le iges }ng on our 8hores of a cable from 1 ern", kum Emdem, on the North sea, by p , of the Azores, and also by the con )r IC ri ite n?l he lele sion on Sept. 2 of a parcels post, i *v,t vention with the German empire, all that promises closer relations ol ad tercourse and commerce and a bc act many can be assured of the most understanding between two races a ing so many traits in common. livia diaj co_operatlon of this governr ?sier and P^P16- We mav be rivals In n the mater,al Paths, but our rivalry sh ] . be generous and open, ever almini , hl ward the attainment of larger re: ,,t, . and the mutually beneficial adva 11 ment of each in the line of Its sp na" adaptabilities. ruct- i *r*"*>e** Controversy Wltk Germs 7 en- ' The several governments ot the nt of pire seems reluctant to admit the wa so ural excellence of our ? food pr< tlons and to accept the evidence we constantly tender of tho care with which their purity is guarded by rigid Inspection.

Then follows a reference to recipro? cal arrangements between Germany and the United States regarding Insur? ance companies, the purchase of the Caroline Islands hy Germany from Spain and the assurance that the rights of Americans in the Islands would be observed. A chapter on the boundary contro versv between this country and Can? ada follows, and the president declares: "It ls hoped that the negotiations now in progress will end in an agreement for the establishment and elimination olf a permanent boundary." The mes? sage proceeds: The government has maintained an attitude of neutrality in the unfortu? nate contest between Great Britain and the Boer states of Africa. We have re? mained faithful to the precept of avoid? ing entangling alliances as to affairs not of a direct concern. Had circum? stances suggested that the parties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly expression of the hope of the American people that war might be averted, good offices would have been gladly tendered. The United States representative at Pretoria was early Instructed to see that all neutral American interests be respected by the combatants *"?>ii trail ty la the Trnaavaal. Upon the withdrawal of the British agent from Pretoria the United States consul was authorized, upon the re? quest of the British government and with the assent of the South African and Orange Free State governments to exercise the customary good offices of a neutral for the care of British Interests. In the charge of this function I am happy to say that abundant-opportuni? ty has been afforded to show the im? partiality of this government toward both the combatants. The president deals at length with the lynching of Italians at Tallulah, *La., and urgently recommends action by the present congress. The treaty of commerce and naviga? tion between the United States and Japan on Nov. 22. 1894, took effect In accordance with the terms of Its sixth article on the 17th of July last, simultaneously with the enforcement of like treaties with the other powers, except France, whose convention did not go Into operation until Aug. 4, the United States being, however, granted up to that date all the privileges and rights accorded to French citizens under the old French treaty. By this notable convention reform Japan's po? sition as a fully Independent sover? eign power is assured. Without repeating the observations of my special message of Feb. 10, 1899. concerning the necessity of a cable to Manila, I respectfully invite attention to lt. I recommend that, in case the congress should not take measures to bring about this result by direct action of the government, the postmaster general be authorized to Invite com? petitive bids for the establishment ol a cable. A chapter on our relations with Mexico ls followed by reference to thc claims growing out of the seizure ol American sealing vessels in Bering sea by Russia, with "the recent happj result of an agreement to submit then to the decision of a single arbitrator.' Then comes reference to Samoa. Af ter referring to the abolition of thi kingship and the appointment of thi joint commission and the new partitloi of the Samoan Islands the preslden proceeds: Claims have been preferred by whit residents of Samoa on account of in juries alleged to have been suffere through the acts of the treaty govern ments in putting down the late dla turbances. A convention has bee made between the three powers for th investigation and settlement of thea claims by a neutral arbitrator, t which the attention of the senate wi be invited.
