TELEPHONE. BEEKMAN S200. A Big Cut la Steel Price Inevitable Tlie theory that present steel prices, or prices approaching those now pre vailing, will be maintained because of the call upon America for steel with which to rebuild Europe Is grossly nbsurd. There was no fighting on English eoll; 'no destruction of property In England save the llttlo damage dono by nlr raids. Germany, Austria und Italy suffered very little dnmage. Tho destruction of property was confined almost wholly to France and Belgium. It would not be unwarranted ex aggeration to say that during the en tiro war there has not been ns much , steel destroyed In wrecked buildings ns Is contained In the Voolworth Building nlono. Tho reason for this Is that the buildings of devastated T- , . K.nn(Ui.l All wn- structcd of brick and stone. There , were no steel buildings ns wo know ,tbcm in America, and In the work of restoration the old methods of con etraction will be followed. There will bo little call for steel certainly no more than Franco herself can furnish. And what Is true of France in this respect Is truo of Belgium, where the ; property destruction was relatively small as compared with France. Bel plum will not need our steel fop re construction. Moreover, both France and Bel glum will not break their necks to rebuild destroyed towns In a minute. They will take their time about It. It Is their way of doing things. All Europe, In fact, takes Its. time, and . plenty of it, in public improvements, end private capital works In the same way. We may as well, therefore, dismiss at once the matter of rebuilding Eu rope as n price sustalner for Ameri can btcel aud Iron. Confined largely to domestic demand when the Gov ernment eeabcs to be a large cus tomer, and this w! i soon happen, stee'. mills will fluil a restricted call for yaufisv 'i is-i it-1 11 mil r a . -o v. uiij - thing approaching them. s The building trade cannot, lu the exercise of common tense, come Into tho market now as a large buyer of steel and other building materials. Buildings erected at the, present cost , of materials and labor could not pos sibly compete with the buildings put up before the era of war prices. The railroads, to be sure, need steel for upkeejv new engines, new cars and mil renewals but under Govern ment control will there be large pur chases for tWs purpose? There obvi ously will bo no new ronds In the near future, and the old ones will of necessity be operated on an economy basis. .So without the Job of rebuilding Europe for our steel mills, without big Government orders, without big rnjir-ftui orders aud without big build ing trade orders, there can bo no de mand for steel that will hold up one corner of present steel prices. When the Government has finished with the feteel mills, steel will go begging In tho market until prices come down to n point that will justify intelligent men In placing orders for steel. It Is a question of reasonable prices for stee, and that quickly, or Idle steel mills. There Is no other solu . tlon of the problem, mid Idle steel mills mean low prices for steel tiot Infrequently starvation prices. The Tardons of MIxtcr and Vlncrnt. WJillo the President's course In par doning Lieutenant-Colonel Gkorgk W. Mixtkk and Meulenant-Colonel J. G. Vincent, whoso violation of the law in transacting business for the Gov ernment with corporations In which they were owners was brought to i light in Charles E. Huoiies'b In quiry into aircraft production, Is un usual, it Is not unprecedented or open to criticism. While there was no ques tion of their violntlon of tho law, It was agreed that their acts had been committed lnnoccntly'nnd In no way injured tho Government. Conse quently tho President granted his pardons before prosecution was un dertaken, giving his reasons thus: "lis tho President believes that the two gentlemen concerned were entirely Innocent of any improper or selfish In tention, that their guilt was only techni cal, and that their service, to the Gov ernment, which hna been of tho highest value and of a moot disinterested sort, deserves the moat cordial recognition." Of tho President's pardon power Bouvieb gives this succinct outline : "The power of pardon conferred by the Constitution upon tho President la unlimited, except in casts of Impeach ment. It extends to every offenco known '.a the law, and may be exercised at any :tma after Its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment 'Tho power Is not subject to legisla tive control. "A pardon reaches the punishment prescribed for an offenco, and tho guilt of the offender. It granted before con viction as in the present cases it pre vents any of the penalties and disabili ties consequent upon conviction frdm at taching; if granted after conviction. It removes tho penalties and disabilities, and restores him to all his civil rights. It gives him a new credit and capacity. There Is only this limitation to its op eration: it does not restore offices for feited, or property or interests vested In others, in consequenco of tho conviction and Judgment." In tho case of a special pardon, as distinguished from on net of amnesty, "to avail tho criminal it must judi cially appear to have been accepted and for this reason It must be spe cially pleaded." Thus, If n penson ac cused of crime "hns obtained n par don before arraignment, and instead of pleading it in bar he pleads the general issue, he shall be deemed to hnvo waived the benefit of It, and cannot afterward avail himself of it in arrest of judgment." As no steps, beyond the recommendations made by Mr. Hughes, have been taken for the prosecution of the Lieutenant-Colonels whom tho President hns par doned, it is to be assumed that their cases will now be dropped and we shall hear no more of them. President Wilson's Railway Views Clear and Sound. That part of President Wilson's message which asked tho Congress members to give partlcnlrr considera tion to our policy with the rallwnys determined nothing and pretended to determine nothing nbout them. It did emphasize forcefully the gravity of this national problem. It did nortrov with lucidity the impossibility of ever! going back to the old days and the old ways. It did declare llutly that th-i Government could never ngaln forbid the ronds to do what they havo been compelled to do under Director-General McAdoo; never again deny the:r rates sufficient to support them, re strictlng them on the one hand, starv ing them on the otlicr, and expect them to survive cither as sound flnnn clal Institutions or as efficient, safe public servants. Whether the ronds go back to the! owners or remain In the hands of the Government, the operation or the national system by the DIrcctor-Gen oral has taught the Government and bus taught tho public, enough n thou sand times over to justify the Gov ernment's experiment us a war emer gency. Nobody ran think now the wildest political ranter could nir longer .maintain that without ade quate rc-tenuu railroads can pay adequate wages, can maintain their trackage, terminals and rolling stocn In proper condition, can build for the future, can do anything but head for the scrap lienp. Nobody Is going. to listen to tho old cant that the cu rlers must not bo allowed to pool. their business or combine their ef forts or divide their burdens when that Is the way not only to help the railroads to better conditions but to assure the public of better or cheaper service. Nobody Is going to try to make votes out of n proposition to bleed the railroads white when these railroads are the very arteries of the nation. President Wilson sees nil this clearly. Unquestionably Congns also sees it now as no other Congress has seen it In n generation. It wns therefore u wise thing and a fair thing for Mr. Wilson to put this question before the Congress member lu exactly the manner he put It. This present Congress can do little or noth ing with the problem. Probably it will not try. It will lenvo It to the next Congress Republican In the House, Itepubllenn In the Senate. This will give time for real study nnd renl work on the knotty question. It will give both the Democratic party and the Republican party tho oppor tunity to decide what shulj be done with It as a natlonnl Issue at the next general election. It will give the American people the material they need before making their 11 mil deci sion ns to whether the railroads shall he operated, Indeed owned and oper ated, by prlvato individuals or by the Government. When President Wilson took over the roads Tnr. Kr.v said that It had no doubt his action was both sound and necessary because of tho condi tion In which thu railroads had been I left by tho starvation policy of the . Interstate Commerce Commission and becauso of the unliearnblo strain of tho war emergency. Wo also said that if the Govwumcut proved by Us "i uctual operation of the roads Unit public ownership was u better thing for the shippers and for the country than nlvnto ownership, undoubtedly that result would lodge tho roads per manently In tho hands of tho Gov ernment, Tho Government has proved noth ing of the kind. Taking tho roads )n tho bad condition they wero In, It Is not to be wondered that tho Govern ment made no success of the experi ment.' But it still remains for the Government to show between now and" tho nest national election whether If can give n better service than private ownership, or whether, If it cannot give a better service, It can at least glvo a cheaper service. Wo havo aimed to bo fair with tho Government In Its operation during tho war. We shall aim to be fair with It In Us operalton after tho war. But if the Government cunnot do bet ter In tho next two years than It hits done in the last year, if It cannot do Immensely better, It ought to bo tin easy thing for the American people to dcclda In 1020 that the railways shall bo both owned and operated by prlvato capital, enterprise, energy and brains. And If this is tho decision of tho nation It also must bo decided, as President Wilson makes clear, that the Legislative nnd Administra tive Government, while still exercis ing a proper and needful control, must not force the ronds to starve, but must permit them to bo supported; must not drive them to tho scrap lienp, but must let them grow and thrive until they are once more the Inconrtparablo transportation system of the world. Nothing but a Coincidence. The circumstance of President Wilson having sailed on the third anniversary of the departure of Ilr.NBY Fobd's peace ship should give not the slightest apprehension to those who are sympathetic with the present voyage. Jfot only ore the captains of the two ndventures widely dissimilar lu the eyes of Europe, but there is a striking difference In the chnractor and occupations of tho two sets of voyagers. Mr. Food took with him pacifists, publicists, disguised Germaiw, "bugs," grafters looking for a free picnic, and n few persons who shared their host's dream of "getting tho boys out of tho trenches by Christmas." Mr. Wilson tnkes diplomatists, publicists, navi gators, geographers, economists, car tographers, ethnographers, historians and so forth. ' Yet the greatest difference of nil between tho atmospheres of tho George Washington and tho Oscar II. is psychological. Mr. Ford permitted his own Quixotic purpose to bo bruised and battered by the surging multifarious opinions of his guests. Ho was u weak Columbus with forty Martin PInzous. On tho George Washington there Is but one mind, one object, one chart. -More Jobs Than Men. From the Federal Employment Ser vice Itself comes full confirmation of Tub Sun's warnings that our na tional problem now Is not n labor sur plus but n labor shortage. One of the strangest things since the armistice has been the political hallucination or fake Unit unless the Government was careful and slow about shutting down war plants and returning munition workers to normal Industrial .fields the country would run Into labor disturbances and so cial upheaval. Anybody with sense could know that this was not so, because anybody wanting to get n plumber to repair burst pipes couldn't find him. Anybody wanting carpenters to stop leaks In the roof couldn't find them. Anybody wanting masons couldn't find them. Anybody wanting any tort of skilled workmen couldn't find them. This condition of labor shortage has been true since tho wur ended to thc'same decree it was true before the wnr ended. Now the Fed eral Employment Service in Washing ton admits It Is true. .So far it has discovered more Jobs looking for men than men looking for Jobs. Nevertlieless, when the welfare of tho country demands that we get back to a normal Industrial basis at the earliest possible moment, the Gov ernment persists In continuing hun dreds of thousands of wage earners on useless und costly war work. It persists lu wasting not merely the labor, which Is sorely needed by pence Industry nnd pence business all over he country, but the raw material now being manufactured to no pur pose whatever. It persists lu wnstlug fuel, still going up In smoke at the munition plants by the millions of tons, when coal Is urgently needed not only lu tho general mill and factory, hut lu the business house and the privalo home. It persists In wa.-tlng the taxpayers' money when already they nro faced with bills for billions of dollnrs for war supplies bought bo fore tho armistice, hut yet to be paid for out of tax collections and bond Issue funds still to be raised. The country want to get back to Its regular business. It Is trying tho best It knows how to get back to Its regulnr business. But when tho war spenders ought to cut It all out they cannot seem to make themselves quit tho spending. Secretary McAdoo's Iteport. Wore Secretary McAuno not rotlr- j Ins (wm tho Treasury Department the nb'-enee from bis annual report, published yestcrdny, of any attempt to forecast necessary measures for the financing of the Government In the future would oxcltc surprise and cause adverse crltlclMii. Hut Air. Mr Anoo Is qulttlnft tho Job, nnd it would U manifestly Injudicious, If not improper, for hlra to attempt to lay down a programme for his suc cessor to follow. ' It is only when tho details of tho Treasury operations ore broupjit to gether in tho manncr''Secrctary Mo Anoo marshals them that wo got a clear Idea of their complexity and mngnlttfdo. Even as he explains tiiem It Is difficult for any citizen un accustomed to the careful study of financial statements to grasp tho full significance of their astounding totals. Where millions onco caused us to wonder at tho resource of tho na tion, billions have been handled with a fnmillarlty that docs not breed con tempt, but Inspires astonishment; nnd from the fact that without throwing tho whole structure of business Into disarray theso transactions of the Government hnve been carried on we obtain an Idea of the solidity of our national structure. Tho fact is that in such documents ns that produced by Secretary Mc Anoo the dollar sign Is n symbol of credits opened, utilized, exhausted, closed, and tho figures aligned behind them monn not currency merely, but tho drafts mado ou tho resources of all agricultural, mining, manufactur ing and business enterprises of tho nation. Studied In tho light of this understanding the figures tnko on new meanings nnd their size becomes moro nenrly comprehensible The Action Begun by tho Commer cial Cable Company. ' Tho action begun by tho Commer cial Cable Company in ttic United States District Court to restrain the Postmaster-General from continuing the enforcement of his order for the seizure and operation of the ocean cables brings this act of tho Govern ment before tho courts for Judicial review and the application of appro priate remedies, and becauso of this It Is worthy of commendation. In the court room tho rights of In dividuals nnd corporations will re ceive that consideration which Is fre quently denied to them in the offices of executive functionaries. The ex tent of tho authority conferred on tho Government under wnr legislation nnd the projection of Its war powers beyond the period of actual hostili ties are of vital importance, not only to tho proprietors of wire systems, but to the owners of every business enterprise In the country. The polltlcnl and economic disputes that have arisen over Government op eration of public utilities cannot bo settled until the legnl status of tho affected enterprises Is established and the powers of the .Government nre clearly defined. This establish ment and definition must bo by judi cial decisions, rendered in actions such as that brought by the Com mercial Cnble Company, nnd on Its qutcome the Institution of other sim ilar suits unquestionably depends.

WOMAN SUFFRAGE. Another Explanation of tho Sonthorn Senators' Attitude To tub Ewron or Tn Son Sir: In a despatch from your special Washing ton correspondent November 28 ho says, In referring to President Wilson's ap peal to the Senate for woman suffrage! He placed th Southern Senators who stuck by h!ra through thick and thin In ths most embarrasalnc position of thtr puWlo careers. He put upon them the onus of falllrr to support him In a vrar measui It ttiov vote) against the amend ment. Tot the political life of every Ban cr from tho South would have been worth nothlnr the moment he voted to permit tlio m-ero women to vote any where. This statement Is not Justified by the fnct", which are that fourteen Southern Senators did vota for this Federal suf frage amendment the day tfter Presi dent Wltcon mado his nddress, without any fear of danger to their political Ufa. They were probably encouraged to do this by the fact that when this amend ment was voted on In tho House of Representatives lost January forty-six Southern members cast their votes In favor of It, and their political life docs not seem to be threatened, at least on this account. Tho bogey of tho "negro woman's vote" is mero camouflage to conceal seated opposition to woman suffrage Itself. Not one Senator who voted ngalntt this Federal amendment would voto In favor of woman suffrage If It were an Issue in his own State. The woman suffrage amendment which was submitted by the Legislature of Louisiana and defeated at the recent election proposed merely to tako the word "male" out of the suffrage clause in the Constitution. This was all that was needed to bar out the negro womsn, for whatever State law prevented negro men from voting would have the same effect on negro women without any constitutional change. When Arkansas and Texas gave the full primary suf frage to women there was not a word In tho law to Indicate that this meant white women only, ns existing laws ef fectually covered thin point The Fed erat amendment does not Interfere In tho slightest degree with the right of any State to prescribe Its own qualifica tions for sunVage with the one excoptlon that It shall not disfranchise on account of "sex." Aside from this It may make its own requirements, but they must apply equally to both sexes. Ida Hustid JlAWin. New TonK, December 4. THE 

PORTUGUESE AT LYS. An Official Account of Their Itelst nnco to Orerwhclmlnp Numbers. To Tim Eniron op Tub Sun Sir: Tho article In Tub Sun regarding tho criti cism made by Frank It, Kent of the Baltimore Sun of the Portuguese army causes me to offer you herewith a trans lated copy of the official iles'-tlptlon of tho battle of Lys on April 19, 1918, so far as It refers to the conduct 'of the Perond Division of the Portuguese Expe ditionary Force, in France. In it these passages occur: "The object of tho German attack was a line going from Bols-Grenler-Fleurbalx-Lys-Canal de la Bassee. . . . "Whole companies, such as tho Ninth and Tenth of tho Eleventh Infantry and others, fought even after they had hecn enveloped to their last man. "Companies nnd oven platoons which had beet 'left Isolated counter attacked with bayonets In a furious attempt to rip open the German masses, but like a flow ing ocean of men the gaps opened wero fllled vertiginously, and the defenders entirely wiped out. "It should be mentioned also that the division was short of over 200 officers, whom It had lost In action. In all the battalions most Mojori had been killed. Nearly every company was being com manded by sub-officers and tho platoons by second sergeants. 'The line which we held was sup posedly occupied by complete effectives : that is, 1.0S3 men to a battalion; the battalions averaged In reality from C77 toSTS! . . . "Our division was dofeated, but stood for eight long hours und?r the most violent fire that was ever ween on that front, and resisted tho Impact of eight enemy divisions i "Suctj a defeat under such a tremen doui disproportion of forces really con stitutes n g'.orUius achievement for the Portugueru who died doing their duty. 'This Second Division was for a whole year uninterruptedly lu the trencher, carrying out and repelling contlnuoue r.iids, nnd with half of its officers gone I" action at .1 in charge of( a front much above Ita strength It could never bo ex pected to act more gallantly than It did against eight enemy divisions. "The commnnderH of the bnttallons of that division ended their days In the bitUe of the Lys without one exception. Of the Brigadiers only one wns left to tell the tale. , "Tho headquarters staffs, that of the Goncral in command inclusive, weiu de stroyed. "Tho Portuguese Second Division, de feated, Is well deserving of Its home land, berauao It died In Its pot of duty fight ing for liberty nnd civilisation. It did not win because It was humanly li'ipos- ; Bible to win under euch conditions." If no laurels were ever sought by the I Portuguese nation from any one except ; tho respect to which they are entitled for tho enormous ejcrlfices and loss of lllfo In France, at fo.i and In Africa which they have sustained with rparso resources and a comparatively email population, It Is right to n."k for Justice for their men and to repudluto with the healthy oncigy obtained from duty ful lllled throughout many moro trials the sluis thrown upon a small but dignified reople.

New Yonic, Ucccmber i. PRESIDENTIAL PROBLEMS. Questions Arising from tho Chief .Executive's Absence. To Tits Editor ok Tiu Sun Sir.1 Five vacancies In the office of President bavo( occurred, all by death. In which tho Vice President has been sworn In, not aa Vice-President, but as Prosldcnt. In two of these cases' tho 'President was for weeks utterly disabled for the perform nnco of executive duties, but tho Vice President did not assume to act. Suppose during those periods an emor genry had arisen requiring executlvo no tion, could tho Vice-President have taken such action as such, after the manner of ordinary corporations? Does tho provi sion of the Constitution providing that the Vice-President shall act in the case of the inability of the President contem plate this? If It does tho matter would seem to bo comparatively simple. But we have no precedent for such ac tion. And tho peculiar duties nnd re sponsibilities of the Executive office would appear to preclude It They all point to the status of the VIce-Fresident as a successor to tho Executive office and not ns a temporary substitute. The law abhors a vacuum or vacancy. The Presi dent la the commander In chief of the army and navy, and these Important bodies cannot be without a head. Can the President continue to be the head of theso arms of the Government when In a foreign land? Probably the answer would be yes, if engaged in actual war In defence of tho country; but what In times of peace? This ralsos tho-question, What consti tutes a vacancy in the Executive office? Does not leaving the country vacate the office? Can tho President leave the country for an Indefinite period nnd still bo President? Suppose in the meantime an emergency arises requiring Executive action, nnd according to precedent tho Vice-President is sworn in as President, we would then have tho anomaly of two Executives. According to law and precedent, the Vice-President cannot discharge the duties of the Executive offVco without be ing sworn In as such. That tho nation should be without an Executive head, or with Its Executive bead absent in foreign lands, is boyi unthinkable nnd untenable. If the President leaves the country does he not step down and out or the laccuiive , office and thus creato a vacancy, which I opens the way for the Vlce-I'resldent to be sworn In nnd thus fill tho olllco? In that case the President at onco be comes a private cltlien. cannot re turn and resumo the office of President, for that ofllcs will have been Oiled. This seems to bo tho logical solution of tho many problems raised by tho going of the President. Another Interestlm; auestlon occurs: What will Mr. Wilson's status ba nt the peace conference? Can he be President of the United States sit ting In that conference? Will ha be ex officio an accredited delegate? Where Is tho authority for such a relation? He cortalnly has not appointed himself a delegate t Again, if on leaving the coun try ho becamo n private citizen, then ho will have no official status there. All these Wflfllderatlons clearly point to tho propriety of the Executive remaining at home. F. I.. Hitchcock. ScnANTO.v, Pa.. December t. 

NEWS OF THE CONFERENCE. America Wants to Know What Hap pens at Paris and Versailles. To the Editor of Tub Sun Sir; Upon the decisions of the peace conference rest tho Issues of the next hundred years. Therefore we are. all interested In It and would like, when tho tlmo comes, to read an accurato nccount of Its doings. Why, then, in the name of "pitiless publicity" or of freedom and democracy, If you like the sound better, aro the American poo plc to be deprived of all news concerning it until it has been veritably culled, Creeled and sugar cured? Is Mr. Woodrow Wilson afraid to trust the sovereign people of the United States of Amerlcn? Does the taking over of every means of communication with Furope, except ordinary letter post, mean that we are to know nothing of tho pro ceedings until the treaties made with the utmost secrecy are handed to tho Ser-ito for ratification? Have tho moves re ferred to been made because Mr. Wood row Wilson knows that ho no longer rep resents the thought nnd feeling of tho American people on the great questions to be decided at that conference? Docs ho fear that If they knew his plans they would repudlato thvm? Cer tainly It looks very much 'Uko it. Huou H. Maoili. Canisteo, December 4. An Eminent Habb! Urges the Presence of the Clergy. To tiik Kditoh or Tun Su.v Sir: I suggest thnt the clergy be represented at the coming peace conference for tho fol lowing reasons: First, the clergy, standing for religious ethics rather than' ceremonlallun or doctrlnaltem. will emphasize that tho decisions of the peace conferenro arc hnscd upon righteousness and Justice. This must appeal to all thinkers In all lands, even those whose hopes and asplratlona will not havo been gratified by some of the decisions. For righteous, noss nnd Justice ao words that mean much. Where would be the hope of the woild for "peneo with honor" without them? And who represents these Ideals better than the clergy?' Secondly, tho fact that tho clergy tako part In the conference will do much to anticipate and to modify the nrMmosltleH, tho Jealousy, tho spirit of revenge, tho humiliation, tho aftermath of tho war. Thirdly, It will add the forco of Bible precedent For the personnel of th highest court of arbitration or adjudlcn- tlon, as Indicated lu Deuteronomy xvll !, Includes, first, clergy; secondly, "inas lerf?

IT GOES TO COMMITTEE First Move to Tako Initiative From Railroad ATlministrar tion Ib Made.. Special DoapatcK to Tn Bun. Wasiiinoton, Dec 4. The first move to restrict the largo powers of the railroad administration over the rail roads was mado in the Senate to-day by Senotor Smith (Go.), chairman of the Senate Interstnto Commerce Com mittee, who introduced a bill to repeal tho power given tho President to In itiate rates. The portion of tho law under which tho railroad administration, is pro ceeding nnd which Senator Smith wishes to repeal is, tho first section and provides that whllo Fedoral con trol continues the President may ln itlato "rates, fares, charges, classifica tions, regulations nnd practices," by filing them from the Interstate Com merce Commission. Tho law provides that tho commission may not suspend theso rates pending final determina tion. ' At present despite the power given to tho President it is provided In the law that the I. C. C upon complaint, may hold hearings and go into tho reason and Juatlco of rates Inaugurated by the railroad administration to which the President has delegated tho power given him. Tho commission la bound by law to glvo the fullest con sideration to certification from tho railroad administration that the ratea ,,,,, nr ,nrv lr mign mopey wth whlch to pay railroad ..,. nr romnensntlnn or tnxes. rentals or compensation or taxes By tho Smith bill, which was re ferred to the Interstato Commerce Committee, all of these provisions would be rc-penled nnd th"? old system of Initiating rates and fares nnd tho like would be resorted to again. Un der the system in effect Just before thu taking over of tho railroads the roads applied for new schedules of rates and fares, and t!jo power lay with the com mission Itself to rcfuso or grant such applications. Senator Smith has Issued u state ment bearing out tho story of The Sun to-day that tho President had no in tention of returning tho roads to prl ato ownership at once. Before the President departed from Washington last night Senator Smith had a con ference with him. Mr. Smith said: "President Wilson's position, as I understand It, Is that ho puts squarely up to Congress the question of work in;; out a future policy, and that ns speedily ns possible. Tho President has no pre-conceived opinions on the biibjoct and now waits for Congress to handle the question." 

LOUIS THE WHIRLWIND. Ho Paints In Forty-seven Masterpieces Seventeen Days. To tub Editor of Tun Sun Sir; This short communication will no doubt In terest your readers, for tho simple reason thnt no other artist In history can equal this my marvellous uchlovc mei.t. I did not make a point of painting eo many pictures It Just happened ; or the mood was Imperative, and yours truly simply was compelled to execute the unusual number. Now, here Is the miracle mado plain : On October 1, having no cardboard, since the war had limited tha supply to the dealers, always resourceful as our roldlers havo proved themselves to be. I found a number of old murtc magazines on my shelf. In.stanter I re vived to use the enamelled covers ns material for pictures. They measured nine by twelvo inches each. I started with tho first: a monu mental success in fact, I produced an effect absolutely new. Another, equally original. On, October 17 I had forty wven gents, most of them diamonds of rich color, no two allko nnd each with the detailed finish or tho stylo of the old masters. Elated, nnd fortunate In having over a hundred magazines Idle, I continued. On November IS I had forty-thtee others. Somo days I executed four in two hours. Ono day. three hours with short rest perloils between, allowed mo to creato eight gems. This la e.uper-nor-mal and I challenge tho greatest painter living to even copy tho eight In one day ! Besides this feat, another, achieved two weeks ago, Ik worthy of history. Then I ngaln could buy enrdboards. I pnlnted four aboluto masterpieces, size twenty-tno by thirty inche.. In one day my day meaim three hours not continuous. 1 challenge the best artist to copy the four In four days time. In fact, It would requlro expert specialists to oxecutrt them. Of course, aside from the small paintings, I painted about twenty flvo largo CHrdhoards, each nn excep tional subject, In a detailed style. I would not crow nbout this feat If tho works wero mero lmprei'loijl?tic pic- j tures. As they are gems In color, al nwt perrect In detail, representing ono hundred Individual subjects and fifty different effects, who can fhow such an achievement, I would like to know! Louis M.
