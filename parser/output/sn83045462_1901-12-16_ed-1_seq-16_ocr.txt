USCeiw --Ave -ann -~ At a =0~ Asa at the Fist Congregadn Chrch, adr the auspices of the We h. Christan Temperance Uno, an Address was deliw ered by Miss Christina Taingft of London, England. Miss Tealing eame to .Amries representing the Womans Brtlah Teaper ance Association at the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union convention held recently at Port Worth. Tem. The speaker dwelt especially upon the prevalence of the drink habit among the women of England. She said that English women are drinking far more than they used to, and by 'the, statistics culled from British death reports It is seen that women are going to the bad from alcoholism faster and In greater proportion than men. "I think drinking among women In our country is due "greatly," continued the speaker, "to the granting of licenses to grocers. English grocers have been licensed for some forty years. The action was taken in the first place. as a temper ance measure. It was thought that If there were more places where people could get light wines there would be a noted Me crease In the sale of stronger liqu6rs, and the public houses would not be so freely frequented. "The groctr's license Is a big fallacy. It did not make a bit of decrease in the sale of stronger liquors, and It did not make the least whit of difference In the attend ance at public housesand bars. It has led to heavy drinkingamong the middle and upper classes. The women of these classes go to the licensed grocer and carry away under their own capes bottles of brandy and whis ky, taking the liquor in their carriages to their homes, and here charging the pur chase of the intoxicants to such things as candles and groceries, so as to keep their husbands in the dark regarding their wives' free use of intoxicants. 

FAVORS NEW DIVORCE LAW. Rev. Dr. McKim's View of Proposed Change. Rev. Dr. McKim, the rector of Epiphany Episcopal Church, in the course of a ser mon delivered In that church last evening, deprecated the efforts that are being made to change the section of the new code rela tive to divorce. Under the present law, he said, seven causes for divorce are recog nized, while the code which goes into effect January 1 bases divorce upon one ground only, and that in the violation of the Sev enth Commandant. He said that in his opinion the Bar Asso ciation was making a mistake in giving its support to the substitute law which stipu lated four causes for divorce.

Aigerium AL Creey qf N.Andrews Church, Rochester, I W, 80 1d s ort. "We and eOrmelves bity yses after the outbreak of the war which the alas power waged against the United States still strug lng with that power for the comnnon rights of man, for the integrity of our laws. and for -the very existence of our government. The Constitution guarantees to every one of its citisens that he shall not be deprived of his life and liberty with out due'process of law. It Is a notorious fact that this provision of the Constitution has been set at naught and that men and women and even children have been de prived of their liberties and their lives without any process of law whatever. "Anarchistic events of this kind have, to our shame, occurred in different parts of our country, but they have been most fre quent in that part of the country where the slave power was dominant before the civil war and where the spirt of the slave driver is still dominant. The victims of these violations of the law in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred are members of that'race which was formerly in bondage to the race that now murders them. "So common is, this method of punishing supposed crimes in the southern section of our country that it has displaced the regu lar proceedings of the law courts. Last year more than 150 human beings charged with crime died without trial. at the hands of the mob. More than three a week. And the perpetrators of this treason against the majesty of the state are today living at large, their crime unpunished, many boasting of their crimes, and their sympathizers sit in the Congress of the United States. Surely anarchy can go no further than this except it murder our rulers, ravish our women and burn our homes." The' speaker dealt at length with the feelings of the slave-holders before the war, and then declared that "the political difficulties of the north. as of the south, are to be solved not by disfranchisement, but by enfranchisement. The enfranchise ment of the mind from ignorance and pride and prejudice; the enfranchisement of the heart from base hatreds and unholy fears." He then said: "The white race has a cause of quarrel with the black race. While we have spent blood and treasure to secure your pclitical and civil rights, we find that you surrender those rights without a struggle. Your old white masters or the sons of your white masters say you shall not vote, and you stay away from the polls. They make laws placing upon you a degrading badge of inferiority. and you give your brows to the branding iron. They shoot you down in the streets and drive you into the swamps, and you do nothing to guard your homes and protect the lives of your wives and children. "Your excuse for this submission to out rage and wrong is that if you resist you will be killed. Killed! What if you are killed? Were not white men killed by the hundred thousand to secure you, under the Constitution, the political and civil rights which you so easily surrender? Do your duty by your country, and, whether you live or die, your country will bless you. "God forbid that you should lift up your hands save in defense of the rights of man and the lives of women and children. Do not kill, but be killed: be killed until your blood becomes as a river defiling all the land; until, like the blood of Abel. it cries from the ground for vengeance. Be killed until you have lost from your veins the last drop of the blood of the slave and can stand up as free men in a free land." Star Advertisements,14th and R. . ave. .

Alleged Infringa-eut. Henry B. Looker, the District surveyor, has informed the Commissioners that a block of five houses erected at the south east cqrner of 33d and N streets. in George town, encroach on N street, varying from six inches to slightly more than a foot. "This report Is made," says the surveyor, "in pursuance of general instructions from the Engineer Commissioner, and is occa sioned by the fact that on attempting to make a survey of a lot just east of this block, in the same square, the encroach ment was discovered. "This encroachment is especially unfortu nate. in view of the fact that this office had precise data in the Brewer collection of Georgetown survey notes with which to lo cate the street lines, but was not called upon to do so." The matter of the encroachment has been called to the attention of the owner of the premises, Charles A. Sickel of 629 F street. by the Commissioners. What action will follow has not yet been determined. Medical Society Adjourns.
