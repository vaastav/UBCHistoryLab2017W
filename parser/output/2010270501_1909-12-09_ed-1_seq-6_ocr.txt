Following a time-honored custom, both houses adjourned soon after their convening at noou out of respect to the memory of those members who have died during the recess of congress.

Much Interest Is felt In the Nlca raguan situation, hut tho general dis position Is to permit the executive branch to deal with It w,lthout legisl ative interference, at least In the present stage. Congressmen generally express no apprehension as to thu out come.

By a majority of 210, after a brief but exciting sitting, the bouse of commons recorded its claim to exclusive control of tho na tion's purse a cinlm never before challenged in modern times.

No prominent member from tho gov eminent side arose In the house of commons to utter solemn warnings against the course tho ministers were pursuing.

Tho question which still perplexes tho railroad officials Is: "What be came of the money?" Tho gtand Jury resumed Its Inquiry Into the case today.
