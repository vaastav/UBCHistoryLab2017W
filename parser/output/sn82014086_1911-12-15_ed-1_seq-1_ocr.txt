Miller, and Into the grand Jury room were taken the stubs of check bcoks and account records of the asso ciation during the five years in which the explosions took place.

McXamara, the onvictei fcecreiary trtesiirer. and was often in company with James tl. JleXamara. McManigal Paid $200 a Job. An important feature of McManigal'B confession liitraeted attention. This was the admission that he usually re- j ceived about $200 for each "job," and ! that when he complained that part of the money was being held back from him. James B. McXamara ad mitted seeing the stub of the check .!d saying that John J. would "fix it tip." Most of the jury's attention today was taken up with an outline by Mr. Miller of what the investigation was to be, how far it was to go, and the number and character of the witnesses who would be called.

CHARRED DOOR IN COURT AS EXHIBIT Expert Engineer Testifies That It Could Not Have Been Closed. New York, Dec 14. The charred doer frame which had stcodT" at the liead of the stairs on the ninth floor of the Asch building, was a striking exhibit today at trie trial cf Isaac Harris and Max Blanck, accused of causing the death of Margaret Schwartz in the Triangle Waist com pany disaster of March 25 last, in which 147 lives were lost. It was be fore this door, it is alleged, that many of tbe victims of the Sre met their fate and on the question as to whether It tv as open or locked rests a consid erable part of ttaj state's case. As the uoor casing stood before the Jury. John D. Moore, an expert engi neer, pointed out spots in the frame whleh, in te natural order of things, wouid have been protected from fire had the door been closed, and noted that these spots were not charred as was the rest of the casings surface. He was not permitted to say whether tiie uncharred portion indicated that it was protected from the fire by something other than the door. Joseph Savina. a former employe of the building, testified that after the fire he found a panel from the door. The panel, in a box. was produced in oourt. Attached to the panel was a -nob and a lock with the tongue of the lock extended. The argument over advision of the exhibit as evidence lasted until adjournment of court un til tomorrow.

The chief accusation, that of a plot between the girls to extort money from the millionaire, he held, was amply disproved by iho fact that the girls bought tfceir revolvers with no attempt at secrecy. Attorney Moore displayed a photograph of Miss Graham taken at the time of her visit to the btokes I farm at Lexmgton, to emphasize the I point that she had been changed from I a beautif il, healthy, buxom girl to the I worn and fras-le creature who bad I wept on the witness stand.

Senate For Abrogation j EARLY ACTION LIKELY ON RUS- SIAN TREATY. WILL REPORT MONDAY Committee on Foreign Affairs to Give Resolution Prompt Consideration No Stir in Russia Over the Matter. Washington, Dec. 14. The abroga tion of the Russian treaty of 1832 be CF.use of discriminations against Am erican Jews and others may become the iaw of the land before the Christ mas holidays' recess of congress. The ouixer . resolution, already passed by the house, directing termination of the treaty after a year's notice, was brought up today in the senate. The result of a running debate on the question of whether to refer It to the committee on foreign relations or to set immediately was an assurance by the committee that it would report Monday. The senate may then adopt either the resolution. with a slight change, or the Culberson resolution, which is praeucauy identical with it Debate in the Senate. The debate in the senate included some discussion of the attitude of the state department. Senator Culberson v. antea immediate action on Mondav j without reference to the committee. He contended that notice of abrogation couia not take effect until one year after "the first dav of Januarv fnl - lowing tho action of congress" and therefore, if the resolution failed of adoption before the holidays, it could not go into enect until 114. or more ttan two years hence. Pleas for Reference to Committee. Senators Cullom and Lodzn r.la.lart for the reference to the committee. Both pledged their utmost efforts to obtain action by the committee to per mit the senate to act on Monday. Sen ator Haynor was somewhat skeptical oi tne committee's ability to agree in that time. He pointed out the pos- siDuiiy oi ainerences or opinion. Demand for Immediate Action. "The time has come for a deter mination of this question," he said. "The treaty has ' been violated for the past forty years. We should act now." Senator Clark of Arkansas, said congress should either act immediately upon the general public demand or go into the question thoroughly. Sen ators Lodge, Bacon and Cullom, re fused to accept the view that the state department was on trial. Finally Referred to Committee. . "The president has told us," said Cullowt "that be is at work on the question and will have something ready after the holidays and the sec retary of state assured me a day or two since that he expected to accom- push something of value to the coun i try.
