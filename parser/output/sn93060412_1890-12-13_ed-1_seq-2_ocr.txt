DRAMATIC OSITIO- We saw In a contemporary a day or two ago a head lino "Do our Dramatic Grilles Abuse Their PriviloKes?" placed over the complaint of au actor that "newspaper critics ofteu do uot know the inside dealings ot a com pany." It that were all, the public would not be a sufferer as otten as it is. The truth is, that while there is a good deal of rot on the stage there is an equal amount of it in the so-called criti cism of what is done there. Tromis cuoua puffing is,ot course, disagreeablo but even that is better than ceiiBiir where it ia not deserved, and which is ouly bestowed for the purpose professing the nil admirari in order to gain a reputation for knowing some thing. If it were only that the critic 'does uot know the inside workings ol a company" the public might have no right to complain. This or that minor actor might be suppressed in glory to loud greater eflulgence to a star, but th? ' ?on?8t 8,'temC lbB WBI aubdued or alighted would be true.and truth ia the most desirable of all things, It was the sum of all beauty ,the fullness of all Justice, the heart of science, and tbe soul of art. Dramatic critics abuse their privi leges, however, not so much because they do not know the peccadillos and jealousies of actors, aa that they do not understand the art which they attempt to write of. It is hardly to be expected that they should themselves possess the creative genius of an Accins Paulus the comprehensive knowledge of Shakespeare, the versatility and purity of diction ot an Addison, or tbe patriotic fervor of a Leasing. These v ere master builders of plays. But if to write iguorantly even upon the pedigree ot swine brings with it certain exposure, then at least something should be kuown of the drama by those who write npon it. The person who credits RIohelieu to Shakespeare, who speaks of Dryden as a great playwright who has never even beard of Moliere of Terence or ot Rabelais,! everywhere posing as a "critic." The entre to tbe theater, the two hours subsequently, to write against space ;famlliarity with the names of tbe authors ol"The Rsg Baby," "The Brass Parrot," and "The Keyhole in the Door Knob,' constitute an equipment aud the patient public that thinks it knows a good thing when it sees it, is inexpressibly sold wbeu it seeks amusement guided by tbe "criti cisin" of the press. So many extraneous things come in to color this "criticism.'' A good looking woman here; a bottle ot ehamuague there; a little snub, perhaps; a curtailment of a dignity When the public pays its penny for its paper, it is not always that it gets its money's worth of information here There are honorable exceptions to this rnle, for it is a rule. There are here and there upon tbe press of tbe country men whose work is in itself au art. Whose praise ia worth something, aud whose censure condemns a play or player beyond redemption. These are men of genius. They are men ot senbe. They are honorable gentlemen. They are not mere ioonoclasts. Tbey realize that it is easier, much easier, to tear down than to build up, and they would rather praise than blame. A critic need not be a cynic. Indeed cynicism unfits him for his work. One need not exactly be a carponter in order to criticise tbe making of a bench or box, but still there should at least exist a knowledge of what is a bench, what i3 a box. Too often, we fear, the dramatic critic abuses his privilege because be has not begun by learning what is a play; and so care less, slipshod and dishonest is much of his work that tbe veteran play-goer passes It by with that utter contempt, which is so often marked with tbe largest audiences to the most abused plays and players, THE ALLIANCE PROTESTS AGAINST THE IOR0E BILL. In view of tbe wonderfnl and decisive part taken by the Farmers' Alliance in he elections of last month, unusual interest is felt In the deliberation of tbe Farmers' Al'iance national conven tion which assembled at Ocala, Florida, Tbia convention represented nearly every state in tbe nnion and tbe dele gates are representative citizens oi their respective states. There were no cranks or hot-heads In that convention. It was composed of tbonghttul, cool, conservative, prudent and eminently patriotic men men who, turning from tbe plow and the workshop, said that corruption and extravagance and aa- ust taxation must ond and tnct section alism should reign no longer. The present congress has turned a deat ear to this warning voice, and counselled by a president unable to rise above his malignity, has entered upon tbe work of supplementing tbe injustice ot its tariff measures with tbe inlamy of its torce bill. In view of the president's message and the determination of con gress to torce mis measure npon me country, tbe alliance In national con vention assembled has adopted "unani mously aud with the wildest eiitbusl asm" tbe following patriotic resolutions: Whereas, Tbe president of Ibe United States iu bis annual message to congress recommends and urges tbe immediate passage of tbe measure known aa Ibe Lodge election bill; and, Whereas, bald bin involves a radica revolution iu tbe election machinery ol ot tbe onion, both atate and national and lta paaaage will be fatal to the autonomy ot the atatea and cherii-hed liberties of ibe citizens; and, Whereas, Bald bill is partisan in spirit and will be partisan lu its appli cation, thus revitalizing tbe gory guoai of sectional estrangement t aud, Whereas, In the holy war which we have declared against sectionalism, tbe firesides of tbe farmers of tbe north. east, south aud west, aro the citadels around which the heaviest battles are being fought; and to tbe end that victory may crown our crusade, aud fraternity and union reserve; therefore, be it Resolved by tbe National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union of Amer ica, In national council assembled, That we do most solemnly protest against tbe passage of said Lodge election bill, most earnestly petition onr senators to employ all lair and legal means to defeat this unpatriotic measnre, which can result In nothing bat evil to our common and beloved country. Resolved, further, That a copy of this preamble aud these resolutions be forwarded to each senator iu congress. Gentlemen of tbe couucil ot adminie tra'ion, gives us tbe confederate home and you will never regret it, A 

WORD ABOUT THE LOBBYIST. It has bweti suggested that much ot the difficulty and unseemly wrang ling over tho appropriations necessary to sustain the state university could be avoided it a lobby for the purpose of securing litem was not biennially sent to the capital to alllict tbe legislature If the board of curators would make a fair estimate, send one or twoot lliei number to present and explain the natter to the proper committee, am then go home, there is not a shadow o a doubt that tbe legislature woul cheerfully make the required appropri atioii. It is tho university lobby at Ibe capital that makes tho average legisla tor suspicious of jobs aud extravagant domands,and briigs tbe university into disrepute. A similar suggestion might be mad concerning the railroads. If the rail roads would keep their professional lobbyists at borne they would certainly fare no worse, aud probably betler,at tbe hands ot the legislature. The people of the stale have no desire to cripple tbe railroad corporations or impose upon them unnecessary burdens or restric lions. All that is demanded ot them Is that they pay their jus', proportion ot the taxes, furuiau reasonable facilities to Ibe public aud treat all the citizens of Ihe state with equal fairness. There would be little iuimical leg islation if the railroad lobbyist himself did uot secretly have it introduced that be might have something to oppose and defeat, and thereby give color to the uocessity for his employment. A disreputable crowd ol boodle dispensers naturally excite prejudice against the corporations employing them, and the honest representative of the people sometimes goes to the extent of being unjust in order to manifest his resent meut aud indignatiou. If tho committees having railroad legislation in charge desire information tbey would prefer seeking it at headquarters and from the proper officers. Nor would they refuse respectful hearing from the respectable representative of any corporation whose interests might be in jeopardy by tbe proposed legislation. Tbe railroads, especially, should learu that their interests must suffer whenever tbey are in the hands of dishonest gang wbo make their living by debauching legislatures and cor rupting the representatives ot the people. A farmers' legislature will be &i the helm this winter, ana we would advise our corporations to consider well the suggestion we have made. Aud as to the university we write every word in love and charity, tor we should delight to see it honored and fostered to even a greater extent tbau ever in the past, and especially to eeeit endowed, so that it could never again tempt its friends into positions which would prove hurtful to them. Tbe possibility of tbe defeat ot the election bill in tbe senate on a direct vote on its passage was discussed last Mouday iu republican circles aud one republican senator went, so far as to say that it would be policy for the democratic senators to permit the do bate to come to a speedy close and a vote tobe taken before the Christmas holi days. It the bill was not a parly meas nre there would be no doubt ot its fate; but the action of the republican caucus informally declaring that the bill shall pass will bind at least some of those wbo do not favor tbe bill to vote for it wbeu it is placed on its passage, Whether this will hold enough doubt ful republican votes to carry the measure through is a debatable propo sition. It is admitted by republican senators that several republicau votes will be cast against it. Mr. Stewart. Mr. Plumb, Mr. Wolcott and Mr Wasbburue a'e counted amoug those who will likely vote in the negative Mr, Teller is an extremely doubtful quantity. He has publicly reseryed the right to vote against the bill. Mr. Jones, ot Nevada, has not been in Washington since congress met, but Just before tbe adjournment of the first session be announced himself opposed to the bill Mr. Paddock baa not determined how he will vote, but he ia known to be opposed to the peuding bill. Jugall ia generally reckoned an opponent of the meaanre, but his attitude toward it may be affected by tbe senatorial situa tion in Kansas. Mr. Davis la said to be doubtful ot bis position. The re publican majority iu the senate ia 12. six republican votes in tbe negative would defeat the election bill. The proposition ot the international opyright bill ia to permit foreignera to take American copyright on the same basis as American citizens, in three cases t First, when the nation of the foreigner permits popyright to American citizens on substantially the same basis aa its own citizens; second, when the nation of tbe foreigner gives to American citizens copyright priviliges similar to those provided in this bill; third4 when the nation of the foreigner is a party to an inler-national agreement providing for reciprocity in copyright by the terms of wbicb agreement tbe tJnited Stales can become a party thereto at its pleasure. A subsidiary, but important proposition of tbe bill is that ail books copyrighted ondor Ibe proposed act shall be printed irom type sot within tho United Ulat.es or from plates made therefrom. Mr. Quay is reported as saying that it tue lorce Dili is passca mere wjll be a majority of Irom 

AO-OQO to 100,000 votp against the republican parly in New York in 1192. Under tbe present political alignment the Empire state is tliaiu to cagt its vote for the tariff reform parly iu 1892, but the force bill ought to be deleated just tbe same. Tbey are making a good deal of fun of tbe Kansas alliance for electing a man as a judge Who dous not know any law. otin me alliance men will never elect a man for United Htates senator Who did not know enough to vote against the McKinley bill. The Jackson county court has decldod to loan school funds hereafter at 7 per cent. Eight per cent baa been mo rale heretofore. Several business houses were burned ma nr.. I I at Bethany, wo., cany weutieBtiuy moruing. A strike has been inaugurated in the Clark thread mills at Newark, N. J. A dispatch from Washington says that the . Republic's correspondent learned that Senator Quay has a substitute for tbe lorce bill prepared, which he will offer in tho senate in a lew d-iy. It is understood, says tho Itepublic, that ho has a much stronger, a more candid and a more complete lorce bill to offer tbau the one prepared by Johnny Davenport, which passed Ihe house aud was subsequently modi fled by him for use iu the senate. Tbe dispatch continues: "Quay has been opposed to tbe torce bill up to this time, but he believes that if a measure of tbe kind is necessary at all it should go the whole length and be able to do beyond doubt aud neradventure what the pending bill was intended to do. "Mr Quay's substitute will be strong enough to make negroes vote whether thev want to or not aud to make them vote the republican ticket. It will be strong enough to make it extremely dangerous for a democrat intending to vote bis' party ticket to approach the polls. It will bo strong enough, in fact, if it should become a law, to send all the democrats in the United States to Mexico, Canada or Siberia. I' ie not probable that Mr. Quay's substitute will be submitted tor some days to come, but wbeu it is, it will attract attention. He will make a speech in explanation and support of his proposi lion. The only time that Quay had spoken in the senate up to date was whan he read a brlet eulogy on tbe life of Samuel J. Randall. His speech ou his force bill will be listened to attentively. He is the moat powerful mail in tbe republicau party, has the party machinery firmly in his grasp, and consequently his somewhat sensa tional movement will be looked for with attention bordering on impatience Judging from this paragraph the reform, labor-republican-boodler-Fillev members of the 35th geueral assembly are tailing even lower than tbey have heretofore been held, and that ia saying a good deal. A St. Louis dispatch says: "Late this afternoon detectives Lawler aud Hard arrested Fred Swaiue and G. J. O'Reilly, and brought them lo the Four Courts, charged with having for some time past been collect ing money irom women of ill repute uuder the pretense that it was to be used in securing tbe passage by ibe legislature at tbe coming session of social evil law, which by regulating such resorts aa the women keep, would greatly improve their condition. Swaine is an ex-member of tbe legisla tore." This ia only a strengthening of what we have elsewhere said to gen tlemen in legitimate business against joining in tbe lobby. It all runs together before a session Is over, ai d it is a stench in tbe nostrils ot decent people. This is a very nice compliment from tbe Globe-Democrat to a man whose sterling qualities of head aud heart have won lor him the admiration aud support of tbe southern people. The Ulobe say s i l,f Wade Hampton be defeated in bis attempt to secure re election his state ia not likely to be ucneiiteu by tbe cbange. lie is a democrat ol the stalwart sort, it is true, but South Carolina will fiud It difficult to secure an abler, cleaner handed and more creditable representative iu tbe senate."

So, after all, it is not to bo wondered at that Don Cameron doesn't want any force bill iu his'u. Still, It was hardly expected that he would como out as diliautly against his party's pouitiou as he did last Wednesday, when he deliberately said for publica tion: "1 will vote against the elec tions bill, whatever lorin it may assume. I am opposed to It in principle aud iu its details. The south is now re Burning a quiet condition. Northern capital has been flowing into the south in great quantities. Manufacturing establishments have been created and are now in full operation, aud a com munity of commercial interest is fast obliterating sectional lawa aud will flually result, in the not tar distant tntnre, in forming one mass of people, whether living in tbe north, south, east or west. The clectiou lawa would disturb this desirable condition and produce ill feeliug between the north and south. I am therefore opposed to the bill and shall assert my indepen deuce as a senator and cast my vole against the measure." It is now authoritatively stated that within three weeks the first trip of the new air ship will be made from Mt Carmel, Illinois, where it is now being built, to St. Louis, a distance of 185 miles, thence to Chicago and from there to New York. The vessel is 200 feet in length and will be propelled by elec tricily. It is claimed that a speed ol 200 miles au hour will be attained. Gen. Miles thus sums np the present shaky Indian situation: "Tbe Indians are great dreamers. Tbey seldom if ever work, and consequently haye plenty of time to sit around and pray and dance and fast.

Representative Bland, of Missouri, has introduced a bill authorizing tbe secretary of the treasury to prepare a new series of legal tender notes or greenbacks which, when the ordinary revenues ot tbe government are not sufficient to meet Ha requirements, he is to pay out in sufficient sums to meet all demands and dues.

Perhaps tho president looks upou the results of the November electiou as in the nature of a compli ment to bim." lilobe-Democrat. This paragraph seems to bo iu the nature of a sockdolager. The i lobe-Democrat speaks of Ihe (armors' alliance meeting in Florida as "a piece ol political idiocy." Singu- lar, how these republicau newspapers hate the farmers' movement! But uot so Hngular, alter all. It means the education of the iiisshus. and that mesiis tho death of Ibe republican party. The republicans who were for two mouths before the election crying aloud to tbe secretary of the treasury to relieve the financial depression are now blaming the result of tbe recent electiou tor failure due lo tbe ante election condition. They are a bright set of fellows, they are. "The anli -election cauards about high prices are withering under tbe light of truth." Begarl as tbe French man would say, wbo was against tbe electiou? We thought everybody was for it. Certainly we don't want a dea potism. The secretary of the treasury baa transmitted to tbe bouse an estimate aggregating $35,600 000 submitted by the secretary of the interior to supply a deficiency for the payment of army and navy pensions for the current fiscal year. Seualor Ingalla should not be dis couraged. Tbia is not the first time that it has beoome necessary in Kansas to purchase senatorial honors ;nor have there been wanting heretofore states men equal to tbe pecuuiary demand. The Globe-Democrat's estimate that 15,000,000 people were missed by tbe tbe. federal census enumerators, is a fine comment on tbe Dndley-Clarkson Porter style of selecting ward bummers for business offices. Mr. S. II. H. Clark has been appoint ed general manager of tbe Union Pacitic ailroad. It is not known whether this will necessitate his giving, up the sim ilar position in the Missouri Pacific.

It is rather singular to see a news paper wbicb afJects to bo friendly to farmers print a paragraph like this from tbe St. Joseph Herald: "We are now exporting ouly enough bieadtd tiffs to feed five millions ot people, uud when we have gained that many more inhabitants exports will cease, farm lands will increase in price and agri culture take ou a Loom."

The house of representatives- has voted down a measure to remove Gen. Graut's remains from Ceutral Park, New .York, to Arlington. They did well. Gen.

Green, prosecuting attorney ol Jefferson county, to be circuit judge, from January 1, vice Judge John L. inomaa, resigned. Mr. ureen is one of the brightest men in Missouri and tbe appointment is an excellent one. Mr, Harrison's assumption that tbe American voters did not understand the McKinley bill is an insult to their intelligence. It is prunes to pebbles that they understood it better than Mr Hamison understands the American people.
