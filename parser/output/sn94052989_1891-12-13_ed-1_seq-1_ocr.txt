VOL. LXXI.-NO. 13. THE TREATIES CONCLUDED. Germany Adopts the Commer cial Agreements, Result or the Efforts of Chancellor Yon ..; Caprlvl—General Irnpe:ns to Trade In Austria. Copyrighted 1891 by tbe New York Associated Fress. Berlin, Pec. 12.—The treaties of com merce are now practically passed in prin ciple and detail by almost the unanimous voice of the Reichstag. The minority, drawn from Ultra-Conservatives and mem bers of the Keichspnrtel who opposed the proposed measures, found themselves too feeble either to divide on the first reading or to try to cause delay by referring the treaties to the committee. Chancellor yon- Caprivi caused it to become known that he would brook no dallying in committee, and that the details of the treaties would in no way be modified. In language of complacent acceptance Ilerr Singer (Socialist), Prince yon Uatzfeldt and Baron Manteuffel (Con servatives). Ilerr Oeehetluuser (National Liberal), Ilerr ltickert (Freisinnige), Ilerr Oerterer (Centrist) and Ilerr Decken (Guelph) supported tho treaties. The Chan cellor dwelt upon the necessity of passing the treaties before Christmas. The results of their operations, he declared, would soon show that no preference had been given to other industries over that of the agricultur ist, lie with great difficulty kept the corn duties as high as three and a half marks. Be concluded his address by announcing that the Government, in the view of meet ing the dearth of labor in the rural districts, was preparing amendments to the laws re a'.inc to the maintenance and housing of rural laborers. Upon conclusion of the Chancellor's speech the Reichstag decided to take a second reading of the treaties in the full sitting of the liouse. EFFECT ON THE BOURSE. . On the Bourse the opinion is general that the conventions will have little effect upou the general"aspect of business for a long time to come. Tlie term .Z dlverein as ap plied to the treaties is consldeiel a mis nomer. Each of the five States contracting, while making some concessions, retains a string of heavy duties against the others. The value of the measures cau only be shown by time. The new tariffs when an nounced hardly caused a momentary throb on the Bourse. In Vienna, however, the prospect of an increase in various traffics under the new tariffs led to a large buying of railroad securities aud gave a general Impetus to business, ln the course of a re cent interview with the editor of the Lu be<k Eisenbahn-Zeitung Prince Bismarck accused the Government of hurrying the treaties. The Prince would not tike a part in the debates because the members of the R-n'chstsg had not been given sufficient time to study the proposals. Referring to the inscription, "SupreniaLex Itegis Voluntas," Ei;Kied in the golden hook of Munich Dy uiperor William and to otlier recent auto cratic utterances of his Majesty, Bismarck said lie had never been a supporter of abso lutism and lie regretted that the Emperor bad made such expressions. TESTING AMERICAN TORK. Agrarian pa: ers continue their endeavors to keep up the fiction that American pork is diseased. Dr. Brmekbuseh, a noted scien tist, has made public the results of hi-, exam ination of three thousand specimens of American pork. He louud traces of trichi- Etc iv about 2;,0 per cent of the specimens which passed through his hands. He ex perimented with cats aud dogs, trying to infect them by feeding them with the dis eased meats, but failed entirely. This the doctor considers positive proof that thichinte survive but a short time after the death of the infected animal. He holds that Ameri can oorst, even'of a poor quality, Is per fectly harmless when it has reached Ger many. The German textile exhibits for the World's Fair promise to be extensive. The Iron and steel manufacturers and the jew elry, toy and china firms are making great F reparations. The Deutsche Bank and the nternationale Bank fur Deutschland will support the project for the erection, be tween Jackson aud Washington parks. of a medieval German village. A noted aristocrat. Prince Ysenburg, has gone to the bad. He dissipated a large for tune, contracted heavy debts and then tied the country. Mrs. Melville W. Fuller, wife of Chief Justice Fuller of the United States Supreme Court, is in this city, coming for her daugh ter Mary, who is recovering from a severe illness. RUSSIA'S DISCONTENT. An Uneasy State of Affairs in the Czar's Do main. London, Dec. 12.— The Chronicle's St. Petersburg correspondent says: Matters here are drifting from bad to worse. The whole energy of the Department of Finance seems centered In manipulating the funds on the Berlin and Paris exchanges. Despite the reports of gold Imports the Imperial Bank return does not show an increase. There is nothing to show whether the gold is locked in the war chest or what became of it. All classes are discouraged because of tbe half-heartedness of the measures taken by the Government to cope with the famine difficulties. The consequences of the am ine are only beginning to be realized. Mer chants complain that the prohibition of grain exports locked up capital and there is no circulation of money; the nobles are un able to collect their revenue and therefore decline to pay what they owe the shop-keep ers; the cessation of couit festivities causes distress to small tradesmen ; the famine funds are frittered away by local authori ties; grand remedial measures exist only on paper; complaints of enormous expendi tures on the army and navy are taken ad vantage of by those unfriendly to the Gov ernment, and the whole empire appears to he a seething mass of discontent. THE ST. JOHN . DIVORCE CASE 1 lie Plaintiff and Her Friends Deny Her Hatband's Charges. London, Dec. 12.—1n the bt. John divorce ease to-day Mies St. John was called In re buttal. She denied the story of ber Inti macy with Cohen, the corespondent. After also denying the testimony of her maid and the theatrical-dresser, given yesterday, Miss St. John admitted she had driven, dined, supped and gone to balls and parties with Cohen, but she did Dot like him any more than she did other people. She did not think Cohen loved her, although he greatly admired her. Miss Samuels, Cohen's sister, said she never saw anything improper In the conduct of her brother and Miss St. John. Others gave similar testiinonv. The deposition by a Mr. Mayer,"a New York theatrical manager, was read. lie slated that lie engaged Miss St. John for her American tour. Arrangements for her tour had been made with Marius. The lat ter never complained to the deponent of his wife's conduct. The deponent said he bad seen Miss St. John and Cohen together four times. Site always behaved as a lady should to a gentleman. It was the custom for lead ing actresses to receive their friends in their dressing-rooms. The court then adjourned. .. * *> , MKS. MACKAY'S riCXUItB. The Melssonier Incident Pronounced Much Exaggerated. London, Dee. 12.—Last Thursday Mrs. Mackay turned over her London residence In Carlton House Terrace to | Mrs. Charles Yates who gave a private concert at high society prices to celebrate her recovery from a severe illness. The mere fact that the concert was held in Mrs. Mackay's draw ing-room assured the financial success of lire. Yates' venture. In an interview Mrs. Mackay said: "I am giving up m> Paris The Sunday Call. house because it is of no further use to me. I did nd even take the trouble to contradict the untruths they told about my destroying the Meissoiiier picture. Meissnuier being dead when I produced his picture shows how absurdly they misrepresented me. Why, even Melssonier threatened to paint an unmistakable likeness of me as Venus If I refused to pay for his picture." CHILEAN BRUTALITY. Additional Stories of the Cruel Treat ■ ment of American Seamen. New York, Dec. 12.—The special corre spondence of the Associated Pres? from Valparaiso, under date of November 12th, tells of the continued ill-treatment of Americans, of the refusal of the lntendente of that city to promise police protection to the market boats of the Baltimore, necessi tating the provisions being scut out by private boats to the cruiser. At the date of the letter there was living on the Balti more a Doctor Stanley (a British subject), who had been a resident of Chile a number of years. He was a witness to the attack upon Turnbull, the Baltimore sailor, who received twenty knife-wounds in the affray last month, and afterward died. Dr. Stanley defended the man as well as he could, and afterward took him to the hospi tal and cared for him. It was kuown that his testimony would be damaging, and a few days later he was assaulted and arrested. Efforts were made to pievent his testimony being taken, but when he was released from prison he went aooard the Baltimore for protection. A number of the crew of the Baltimore subscribed nearly 

SSOO in gold and purchased a monument, suitably in scribed, to place over the graves of Biggins and Turnbull. ANOTHER CASE OF CRUELTY. Another case of cruelty to an American seaman has attracted attention. The Ameri can steamer Keweeuaw, from New York for Sau Fraucisco, stunned at Valparaiso for repairs in October. One nf her crew, Patrick Shields, was arrested for drunken ness. The man admitted that be was drunk, but says he was given no hearing at all and was refused permission to communi cate with bis captain on the vessel or with the United States Consul. He was kept at work cleaning iho street fur more than a week and was brutally beaten by tho police. When released he was scarcely able to walk, his back and aims being a mass of bruises, and according to the statement of the surgeon who attended him lie received internal injuries which will prevent him working fur several mouths. Consul Mc- Creery took the man to the lntendente to show the latter his injuries, but the In teudente declined to look at him, though he promised to Investigate the ma ter. No con clusion had been reached in the case up to the date of the letter. IIATTA'S MANIFESTO. The Herald's Valparaiso cablegram says: The circular letter prepared by Minister of Foreign Affairs Malta for distribution among the Chileau legations of Europe and America gives Chile's side of the difficulty with the United States, grow ing out of the Baltimore outrage. lie say-: "With reference to the report of the Secretary of the Navy and the message of the President of the United States, I think it opportune to say that the Informa tion upon which the report and message is grounded is erroneous or deliberately incor rect. So far as the refugees are concerned, they never have been threatened with cruelty, nor has any one attempted to take them from the legation, nor has their de livery beeu ordered; nor has the house or person of a foreign Minister be. molested iv spite of the dallying and intentional provocation. This is proven by eleven notes of September, October and November. Concerning the sailors of tire lialtimore there is want of exactness and frankne-s in the statements made in Washington. The affray took place in the had quarter of the city, the 'Maintop of Valparaiso.' and among people by no means models. When the police and the other forces inter fered and calmed down the tumult there had already been several hundred men engaged, and it had spread to a distance of ten blocks or mire lroui the place where it commenced. Mr. Kgau pur posely communicated to us a note in i.^iires sive and violent language on October 2tJth, as shown by a copy and a note, which were answered October 27th. October 18th began the summing up, which was suspended on account of the non-appearance of the crew of the Baltimore and on account of the illegal! pretenses and denials of Egan. There has never been any provocation com menced or accepted by this department, ami it has always maintained an attitude of firmness and prudence." A 

CHILEAN" DEFENSE. "It never bad an aggressive policy, and will never approve of a humiliating one. Notwithstanding the fact that interested parties may try to make their conduct ap pear honest and try to dodge the issue by erroneous accounts, whatever may he said or may have been said in Washington, the telegrams, notes and papers sent you contain the truth, and the whole truth, about what has happened in regard to this affair, and the 111-will and subsequent conferences and pre tensions have not proceeded from this de partment. Mr.Tracy and Mr. Harrison have been led intoerrnrconcerning our people and Government. Their instructions of impar tiality and amity have not yet been complied with. They are not now, nor have they been before, and if no complaints have been made again-t the Minister and sailors it is because the public and notorious facts in Chile and thn United States could never have been made use of by our confidential agent", even when well established. Balmaeeda's demands and concessions were made in June and July. The whole Itata affair, the San Francisco in Quintero Bay and the matter of the cable company are proofs of it. It has been purposely misstated tint the North American sailors were attacked in various localities at the same time. No final sum ming up having been concluded, it remains unknown who and how many are the guilty parties. Your Excellency should uamo the note of November Oth, In answer to Minister Egan, as well as the other note asking for evidence which he did not like to give, although he said he had proofs to show the murderers and the other guilty parties of October lGtb, and also the other notes. Your Excellency should have them trans lated and published. In the meantime please deny all that appears to the contrary. We are sure of your punctuality as we are of the right and propriety of Chile's acts and nf the final result, in spite of intrigues that descend so low and threats that come from so high in this contingency. AN EXPLANATION DEMANDED. Senator Gondarillas asked last night for an explanation from Malta of his letters to the American Government, referred to by President Harrison in his message as in sulting. In reply, Matta replied that there was not the least truth in the characterization.. lie never penned an Insulting reply to the United States Administration. On tho other hand Kuan's tellers to the Chilean Foreign Office were Insulting to a marked degree. Matta then went on to maintain the truth of data contained in the circular letter to the Chilean Legations in Europe and America. Ile add- d, with vehemence, that Chile would act in every way with strict justice, and scored Egan and Consul McCreery for alleged withhold ing of evidence necessary to arrive at a clear understanding of the merits of the Balti more case, lie said nothing would prevent Chile from fully investigating the affair and panishing those found guilty in accordance with the laws of tne hind. Ilerr Gutschmidt, the German Minister, Is doing all in his power to stir up ill-feel ing against the Uulted States Government. It is said that he promised the Chilean administration the support of Iho German fleet in the event of war between Chile and the United States. The entire correspondence between the United States and Chile on the political refugee and Balti more outrage questions is published to-day in'the official organ, Washington, Dee. 12.—Newspapers In Chile estimate that the expenses of the Con gressional party in the revolution against lialmaceda reached 815,000,000, of which Seuora Edwards, mother of Don Edwards, the Minister of Finance, contributed $885,000 from her owu fortune. ■-♦■ —— A Steamer in Distress.

Five Persons Killed and Two Others Fatally founded—Vengeance Threatened—Colo rado Militia Under Arms. ■reels) to Tin Morsimo Cam, Denver, Dec. 12.— strike of the miners at the mines of the Colorado Coal and Iron Company at Crested Butte has re sulted seriously. Since the men— ltalians and Austrian*— been out they have been very ugly, refusing to allow the com pany to bring ln new men. They stopped the pumps and fans, allowing the mines to fill with gas until there Is danger of the mines blowing up, and have paraded tho streets heavily armed, threatening death to any oue attempting to assist the com pany. Yesterday Sheriff Shares of Gunnison ar rived with a posse of twenty-five meu to take possession and guard the mines. No sooner had the Sheriff and men alighted from the train than they were attacked by 200 armed Italians and Austrians, who be gan firing with Winchesters. The officers held their men for a moment, and then or dered them to return the fire, which they did, with deadly effect, killing Mike Copui cine, Mike Minnelon, Mike Quercio, Mike Warn and John Poche, all Italians. George Simonioi and Grahake, Austrian?, wero fatally wounded. After the firing the miners retreated and the posse took possession of the mines and threw up redoubts. The miners swear venge ance upon every friend of the coal com pany and the town is upon the verge of a riot. Further trouble was feared to-night. The Governor has called out the State militia, and the troops are now at their armory ready to start for the scene by spe cial train at a moment's notice. i ♦ ■ DR. HAVES' TRIAD. Medical Experts Examined as to the Cause of Mrs. Barnaby's Death. Denver, Dec. 12.—Most of to-day's ses sion of the Graves trial was occupied by testimony of various medical men connected with the case as to what caused Mrs. Bar naby's death, the effects of arsenical poison ing, etc. Dr. Buckman, who performed the autopsy, thought the primary cause of death was arsenical poisoning, the immediate cause being congestion of the lungs. To gether with Dr. Grant ht said he yesterday examined Mis. Worrell. They found the muscles of her feet very much degenerated. no sensation in portions of her feet ami in tl urination of the toes of one foot. Inflam mation ol the nerves was a direct cause of those symptoms, and only three things brought this about—arsenic, alcohol or syphilis. In his judgment this condition of Mrs. Worrell was caused by arsenical poisoning. K. B. Carrier, a brother-in-law, and sten ographer to Worrell, testified to his getting a package out of the Postoffiee and taking it to Worrell's office, where, three or four days later, he opened it for Mrs. Barnuby. Worrell said he would carry It home for her, aud the next day after Mrs. Barnaby had been taken ill. The witness was requested to bunt up the wrapper and stamp, which had been thrown in the office waste-basket. The defense endeavored- to prove that the stamps saved by Worrell were those taken off one of the packages whicl) Dr. Graves did send inste.id of from the one containing the poi-on. An adjournment was taken while this point was being argued. ♦ GREAT EXPECTATIONS. Glowing Predictions of Progress by a Resi dent of Britiish Columbia. Chicago. Dec. 12.—8. T.

Every effort will be made.to divert the trade and travel now going via San Francisco. Mr. Rogers spoke of rich strikes made in the Kootenai Mountains a few days before he left for the East, and says if first reports come true their silver mines will pale the Cornslock lode.

Blame's Influence on American ||| Policy. Lack of Intelligence of London Journals. Xy False Reports From Chile—The l-y Royal Betrothal. Special to Thk Moeniso c-At.r,«. . New York. Dec. 12.—The Tribune's special correspondent in Loudon cabled to day as follows: President Harrison's dis cussion of foreign affairs in his message brings home to the Briton more forcibly than ever the "wickedness" of Blame. The United States, he sorrowfully exclaims, never used to have any foreign affairs, but for the last three years that Blame has been Secretary of Slate it is his "fidgety activ ity" which has created them all. Of course It Is Blame who murdered the Chief of Po lice at New Orleans, and then murdered his murderers aud then wrote all the Italian dispatches on the subject. He was at the bottom of tbe revolution in Chile. He sent Egan there when that country was con vulsed by civil war. This last is what a Tory organ seriously asserts. Ho perse cutes the Jews in Russia and then remon strates against the persecution and snubs ; himself for meddling in matters which do not concern him. He Is egging on the Ven ezuela quarrel with Great Britain. All these and other offenses he commits, not, as you might suppose, from pure cussedness and because his name is Blame; it is be cause "he came in on the crest of the Irish vote" and his policy is an expression of "the thraildom of the Republican party to the Irish bosses." Such is the degree of in telligence with which one of the three ablest papers in England discusses American af fairs; such the depth of its knowledge of American politics. -s * 

CONCERNING CHILEAN AFFAIRS. The passage in the President's message relating to Chile has the advantage of ap pearing side by side with a dispatch from the Santiago correspondent of the Times, who renews his attack' on the American Minister and accuses him of writing insult ing notes in Santiago, apparently to the Chilean Government, and of sending inac curate-telegrams to Washington. He fol lows this next day with the prediction that the President's message will produce a pain ful impression in Chile, and the statement that the American colony In Valparaiso are highly Indignant at the action of the United , States representative, which they declare is I based on interested personal motives, such as "gambling on the exchange." He adds that if the whole truth were known a message of apology from President Harrison would be necessary. In the meantime his own ; apology for sending and that of the Times for publishing such a stream of libels on America and Ameri cans ate still unaccountably delayed. If the gentleman wants to get up a war be tween Chile and the United Stales the value •t his friendship for the Chileans is open to uuht. He and even some of his more sober colleagues on the English press seem to ' orok i ,at Chile ts men- a match i f„ii her .fellow-republic In North America. Til «-.4 the opinion of a lay amateur.

ROYAL BETROTHAL. •_--.•'-' The betrothal of Prince Eddie to Princess May (I give Hum the names by which they are commonly called) is on the "whole popu lar. hat is said of it in the press is more or less conventional and some of the rapt ures are in too high a key, but monarchy is still a great force in this country and seri ous people feel that it will be sc, and think it no light matter when the future heir to the throne chooses a partner who will share it with him. To be the King and Queen of England is a great destiny. If Prince Eddie has not yet become a great figure lv public life, it is partly because bis father continues to discharge with efficiency and to the gen eral content of the community nil the duties of ceiemouy which devolve upon him, and many which are more than duties of cere mony. You heard much last summer of his unpopularity; probably too much. The English press, in its unusual attitude of a moralist on gambling, overdid the matter. ' CIIUUCH AND STATE.

The Financial Situation Unfavorable—A Gov ernor Resigns. •", •_' London, Dec. 12.- A dispatch from Rio Janeiro to the Exchange Telegraph Com pany declares the reports of gravity in the political situation there are greatly exag gerated. The dispatch adds that the finan cial situation continues to be of a most gloomy nature, and many of the largest undertakings, it says, are likely to collapse at any moment.

Comments on the Effect of the McKinley Tariff. New York, Dec. 12.—A London cable gram says: English comment as to the do mestic part of President Harrison's message is all colored by irrepressible prejudice touching the tariff and free trade. The free-traders are astonished by his figures— so much astonished that one amiable critic suggested that they had probably been "cooked." English free-traders believed, as one of them says, that the direct and im mediate result of the McKiuley tariff would be to diminish the total volume of Ameri can exoort and import-trade. Both have nevertheless shown their disregard of eco nomical laws by increasing. What resource have the doctrinaires, except to sug gest that the Presidential statistics aro open to a good deal of criticism? The In crease of free imports by $100,000,000, and the decrease of dutiable imports by the same amount, are additional blows to the, doctrinaires. " Why," tbey ex claim, "this is just what the pro tectionists desired and predicted. They wanted to keep out the foreigner where he competes with home industry and let him in where he does not." But the triumphant protectionist need not be too triumphant. Tho free-trader has had an answer ready. "A more accurate analysis will soon disclose that much of that increase in the volume of trade is emphatically bad trade." Why want • for more accurate analysis? Why not say at once that all trade is bad, which is got free trade? That is what he means. No trade in America can be good which does not enrich the British manufacturer at tlie expense of tbe American. Let that be understood once for ali; The advantage of this method of economical criticism ls obvious; it renders the lree-trade critic independent of all facts aud figures which do uot support his theory.
