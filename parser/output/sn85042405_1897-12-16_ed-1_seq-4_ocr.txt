THE Fargo Forum reports that petition, signed by farmers, physicians, merchants, blacksmiths, bankers ar.i others frum Page, Cass county, has been gotteu up to praise Governor Bridget for offering to furnish funds ^to prosecute the railroad rate case. If the petitioners would pause and think they would soon see that about all the good that is likely to come out of this proposed suit is the public agitation of the need of a lower rate on grain and other classes of freight. The state railroad commissioners do not claim any right to regulate freight rates in other states. The most they could do, if the oourts sustained them, is to enforce a reasonable rate between points within this state. As most all the North Dakota wheat is shipped to Du luth or Minneapolis through another state, the case is simply one for the inter­ state commerce commission to act upon. There might be a local reduction OD rates obtained, but it would only effect shipments mostly from one town to another in the state. Such a reduction, it is true, would help a few wholesalers and shippers somewhat, but would not effect the great bulk of the freight busi­ ness nor bring the relief sought by the commissioners, to the producers of the state. Tbe interstate commerce commission has publicly declared they have little or no authority under the law to enforce their rulings. A suit brought before this commission involves a long, tedious and expensive process where any rights for the public are to be gained, and tbe result is practically Predetermined. So the wheat raisers of North Dakota have little prospect for prosecuting a success­ ful suit for freight reduction on giain before the interstate commission aod less through the efforts of any state railway commission. In this matter the voters have gradu­ ally allowed themselves to be drawn into a legal tangle from whioh there is no esoape at present and not until a more intelligent and united policy is pursued by them. What freight reductions, therefore, we can hope for, must come through the voluntary gift of the roads, on their own judgment as to the wisdom of suob a move in settling up and developing the state, and thereby increasing their own business and the value of their own property. 

OTHF.R STATES BEHIND. THERE are more states than North Dakota where tbe expenditures exceeded the revenues and where tbe officials are demanding increased taxation to meet tbe bills. Tbe actnal financial condition of this state is probably known to but few and ia not likely to be fully known tor some time. Tbe state bas bad to borrow money to pay running expenst a and ia at tbe debt limit. In Iowa the state anditor in bis bi­ ennial report, estimates tbat there will "be a deficit ia tbe state treasury of nearly $300,000 next June. He recom­ mends tbat tbe state finances be brought to a oash basis, that tbe legislature in­ crease the tax levy fof the next two years to suoh an extent as may seem necessary and reduce the expenses of tbe state government and tbe state institutions. Illinois bas jnst bad her'.legislature called in special session to provide, among other things, for increased tax­ ation and to meet such expenses as supplies for the soldiers home, etc. Other states are in tbe same fix. The national government is running from 40 to 60 millions behind, a year. The remedy is the same everywhere— raise more taxes. Increased expenses, more public offices, increase of tbe dependent class on government employment or bounty, all mast be paid by tbe taxpayer, whi.'e bis power to do so is decreased, and de creasing. IGNORING THE PARTY CAUCUS. IF reports from Washington are to be believed a spirit of opposition to the party canons rnns high this session among tbe republican members. Speaker Reed is openly opposing some of tbe important recommendations of tbe presi­ dent, like tbe proposal to annex Hawaii as a territory of tbe United States. There are several important issues advo­ cated by tbe administration opposed by men like Hoar, Reed, Dingley. A re­ publican member has secured pledges from associates to oppose tbe civil service law which MoBinley is greatly in favor of. Tbe feeling to vote and speak inde­ pendently of tbe caucus on leading questions was never as strong, it is said. It shows that tbe time is coming when tbe party caucus and the party whip will lose tbeir force and men will not act subordinates or mere part* of a And it also shows a lack of )M confidence in the MoKinley Hanna faction now in control ot tbe patronage. Tbe patronage argument it is eipected, will be used as the last resort, tbe same as by Cleveland, but its influence is pur­ chased intluence and is naturally tem porary and unoertam. All this is a good sign for the oountry at large. DIVIDED OPINION. THE republicans in congress are divid ed on President MoKinley's currenoy scheme for breaking tbe endless ohain. While none of them propose tbe right remedy, viz, exercisingthe gov­ ernment option to redeem tbe green* backs in either gold or silver, yet severul prominent republican leaders strongly oppose the MoKinley plan. Congressman Walker, chairman of the bouse committee on banking aud the currenoy, speaks of the president's sug­ gestion as follows:j "The recommendation that greenbacks redeemed in gold be not paid outexceot for gold, if enacted into law. would en­ able one man with SI,000,000 of green­ backs, demanding gold of the treasury and then depositing gold in the bank for greenbacks aud repeating the prooese 3iG times, to retire the whole8.'UG,000,000 in the time it would take him to oscillate between the sub-treasury in New York and his confederate foreign broker. "The recommendation that banks be required to redeem their cotes in gold with no other provision of law would cause every bank in the country to sur­ render its circulation, and then what agency would keep the country on a gold basis." A BIG 

UNDERTAKING. THE ladies belonging to various tem­ perance societies in the country are un­ dertaking a big task to clear off a 8300, 000 mortgage on the splendid W. C. T. U. building in Chicago before Christmas. If they succeed it will be an event worth recording in the fight against the mort­ gagee and the increasing power of his dollar over the earning capacities of both men and women. The plan pro­ posed by Miss Frances Willard is out­ lined as follows and everyone hopes that sucoess may attend it: Every White Ribbouer in the United States has been asked to raise §2, no matter where they get it. The money of ths brewer or disiiller or the tnoder uter drinker will be vrecome for the good cause, on the principle thpt the end justifies the means. Each White Kib Uoner in the country, aud there are nearly 150.000 of them, has received four cards, each having a little space for the insertion of a fifty-cent piece. These cards they are asked to send out to their friends outside of White Ribbon lines with aB invitation to subscribe the fifty cents, and send tne card to the temple. MANITOBA WHEAT GRADING. FARMERS of North Dakota are not the only wheat raisers who complain of grades given wbeat. In Manitoba the "kick" is reported as greater than in some localities on tbis side the line, i'he East Grand Forks Courier says: Farmers this side of the Canadian line are not the only kickers on misgtading of wheat. The Chronicle, published at Morden, iuan., contends tbat by fraudu­ lent mis-grading of wheat the farmers of tbe three municipalities of Stanley, Duffenn and Rhineland have been cheated out of a sum approaching to $50,000. This sum is arrived at as the difference between No. 1 bard and No. 2 bard, on approximately 1,500,000 bushels wheat. Of this great quantity of wbeat, probably not one-tenth, according to tbe Chronicle, bas been graded No. 1 herd. At Morden elevators all wheat is graded No. 2. Yet there is good evidence tbat almost all tbe wbeat grown in tbe dis­ trict under consideration will meet tbe requirements of No. 1 bard as defined at tbe beginning of tbe shipping season by tbe grain standard board. INVESTING SCHOOL MONET THE state eobool board of university and sobool lands is seriously considering tbe plan of making loans of school money on farm security. This plan was proposed by the former Shortridge ad­ ministration and loudly denounced and ridiouled as nothing but a "pop scheme" to distribute the school funds to the horny-handed farmer. Now that a sup­ posed political advantage is seen in the proposition, the plan of the despised "pop" may be adopted,by those who once frantically opposed it. Tbe plan is of doubtful utility how­ ever, and will oertainly leave tbe state open to imposition and loss. Tbe school funds tbat oannot be invested in other securities had better be left for tbe use of the banks where deposited, than in­ vested in certain lands under the exist­ ing provisions of tbe law tbat permits it beiag done. COMPARISON OF TARIFF RECEIPTS. THE following figures show the revenue which was scoured by tbe two tariffs during the initial four months of their operation: Wilson ant. First month $15,501,wo Second montn 11,4)62,118 Third month 10,260,««2 Fourth month 11,203,049 sbw-'laaft^* Dingley act. $ «,087,702 7,848,100 $t,713,404 9,830.025 Four months 348,990,849 «84,474,3»1 Tbis presents a balance of over 314, 000,000 in favor of tbe Wilson bill. It should also be remembered tbat tbe revenue secured by the Wilson bill for time in questton was collected when business was paralyzed by the panic of 1893, while the Dingley bill was operat­ ing under conditions tbat are claimed to be entirely opposite. ADMITS IT IS RIGHT. PRESIDENT MCKINLKY recognizes the desirability of bimetallism in bis mes­ sage to congress. He refers to tbe com­ mission for an international agreement,as having done good work, and expresses the-hope tbat further time may see the effort crowned with success. MoKinley probably does not believe any agreement except possibly with France, can be re&ohed,but be acknowledges the justice and right in tbe principle involved—the equal use of botb metals as money. To do this, and not insist tbat a great nation like the United States can afford to take a firm stand for what is right, regardless of the movements of other nations, is not in aooord with the professions of a statesmen or a president of tbis nation. THE sentiment against the annexation of Hawaii js growing fast and there seems little probability of congress tak­ ing the step. Ex-Senator Fred Duboiee of Idaho, who has just returned from a trip to China, Japan and tbe island,says: The United States will not annex these islands against the bitter opposi­ tion of the natives. He says there ore less than 1,200 male Americans on the islands over 21 years of age and nearly half of them are opposed to annexation, while nearly all the balance of the popu­ lation are against. Asa matter of safety and general poli­ cy the proposition for the United States to acquire as territory, any land or is­ land, inhabited by foreigners and ^differ­ ing largely from our own in all sooial and racial respects is not regarded with favor. We have enough to take care of as it is—enough foriigners to civilize, for the protection of the liberty of the American citizens. HON. R. P. 

BLAND, pitilessly puue tures McKiuley's recommendation that national banks be permitted to issue notes at the par value of bonds deposited and that the notes be redeemable in gold. Mr. Bland asks: "If it is a great strain and burden upon the government to maintain gold redemption for 834G, 000,000 of greenbacks, bow enn tbe banks possibly obtain gold to redeem their notes? If all the wealth and power of the government finds it hazardous to maintain gold redemption, how could part of that wealth invested in banking institutions procure gold? The banks would be forci/d to surrender their notes and thus work disastrous contraction of the currency. No scheme can be devised that is worse than this."—Minneapolis Times. Di:cEM iiii wheat closed today the Oth, iast, in Chicago at 81.07 and 94c. in LHI luth, a difference of 13 cents. This seems to clearly show an arbitrary con­ trol of the markets the ordinary differ­ ence being bvt about four or live cents. Duluth prices which have heretofore b6en several cents higher than Minne­ apolis are also of late reduced beioiv Minneapolis. To account for this on any legitimate trnde reason is difficult. These differences in prices, developed in tbe last few weeKb, show a control of market prices at Duluth and Minneapol­ is which the producer of the northwest better understands when be sells bis grain. THE city comptroller of Chicago is ad­ vertising for bids for supplies and states in the advertisement tbat certified checks on the First National bank of that oity—Secretary Gagf's bank—will not be accepted. The bank refused to pay a certified check deposited by a bid­ der, on a former occassion. Tbe city sustained a loss there by and bas begun suit for its collection, and the bunk threatens the city with a suit for tbe reflection in tbe advertisement. It looks as if tbe oity had the better end of tbe deal and was in the right. The banks explanation bas not been published as yet. IT IS said there are over fifty divorce cases pending in Grand Forks county and not over half a dozen will be con­ tested. Tbe state law thus seems to be shown as an acceptable statute of relief for by far the greater number of those who are directly concerned—the clients in tbis olass of cases. There is consid­ erable opposition to the North Dakota divorce law, from many quarters, but it is frequently asked why should arbitrary obstructions be placed in tbe way of parties who have determined and agreed that a legal separation is for their mutual interests? IT IS reported from lac una that Rocke­ feller, who invested over $4,000,000 in railways, mining machinery, mines, etc., at and near Everett, Wash., will lose over $3,000,000 in tbe scheme. Fart of the Everett & Monte Cristo road, a min­ ing line, which was recently washed out will not be rebuilt as tbe mines do not pay. But the Standard Oil company will never miss a few millions more or less and the money bas done some people a good turn in their being allowed to earn and spend it. PRESIDENT ELLEN of the Northern Pacific oalled the attention of the board of directors at tbe New York meeting to tbe faot that the net earnings of the comoany for tbe four months ending Oct. 31 were $^,440,000. He estimates the net for November at $1,300,000 and for December at $900,000, making net earnings for the first six months of tbe fisoal year $6,640,000. The fixed charges for tbe entire year were about $6,000,000. Tbe estimated surplus for tbe entire year over fixed charges is $2,785,000. THE associated press is sending oat long accounts of murder mysteries and details ot oriminal trials that fill oolumns of the press of certain leading dailies. ThiB is to the exclusion of other and far more important matters for tbe pnbln. The fate of one man, a criminal or other wise, is an insignifi­ cant subject for any prolonged attention these days, exoept where he stands in some relation to a prinoiple affecting tbe whole people. IF congress wants to economize where it would count, let tbe old "river and harbor" appropriation be thrown over board, or out to a figure where necessity demands. The expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars in what are prao tiDiilly uanavigable streams is a clear case of squandering money. Some of the big monthly deficits might be re­ duced in this way. 

ILLINOIS has oue of the smallest wheat acerages ever sowed, owing to dry weather last fall. The acreage is 12ptr cent, or nearly half a million aores less than last year. The graiu lay from four to eight weeks before sprouting and much of it, according to the bulletin of the.state board of agriculture, is uneven aud unpromising in its appearance at this time. THE prosperity wave bas not rolled over Minneapolis in spite of the daily assertions of her press. The city schools are likely to be closed for want of funds. There is a great difference between the real facts in regard to the wave as seen in the cities and towns, and the state­ ments read in the press. These latter assertions have been aptly oalled "barren idealities." THE opinion of leading congressman and senators on the president's message is that McKinley reaHy means to retire the greenbacks, although he does not say so. Even republican mGiiibGrs who specify any points in an opinion are in­ clined to omit or excuse the presidential references to the currency and to Cuba. Til EKE is confidence shown in North Dakota dirt. At the annual delinquent tax sales every county reports plenty oi' bidders. Outsiders are beginning to realize the value of our cheap farm lands and hope to get some of it jr the unpaid taxes. The interest and penalty however would seem to be sufficient in itself. Two blind piggers sent to jail in 13ot tiueau county under the provisions of our state prohibition law, got out lust week. They did not escape through any loop hole in tbe law but broke out of their cells. The North Dakota pro­ hibition luw when it is enforced dueo uut let any guilty man escape. THE Chicago Inter Ocean, since its control passed into the hands of Chas. T. Yerkes, the street car magnate has been making it warm for Yerkes' news­ paper enemies in Chicago. Medill of tbe Tribune, and tbe Record publisher have been shown up under powerful magni­ fying lenses. THE Minneapolis Journal has the nerve to put tbe blame for Cleveland's issue of $262,000,000 of bonds ou Senator Teller and his "clique," as tbe Journal calls it. Partisan misrepresentation ha6 no limit in (he Journal office. THE six days bioycle race in the Madison Square graden was declared more brntal than a prize fight.
