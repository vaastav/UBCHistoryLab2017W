Allied flags were flown in the Frederick William place, where the allied generals assembled to take the salute of the troops. Order a am been reestablished In Cologne as the result of. the ar rival of an advance guard of Brit ish troops. There had been sev eral days of the keenest anxiety In the city, caused by extensive riots nnd pillaging on the part of the mobs of the lower classes, wltn attendant-bloodshed. The disorders began Wednesday nicht, after the withdrawal of the German troops. They continued the next nicrnt in various Quarters on large scale. Much damage was done to property ana a large quantity of goods was stoien irom me stores. According to burgomaster Adenauer, the uprising was due to the Inability of poor food and clothing. He thought there was little reason to doubt, how ever, that the trouble also was due In part to the freshly inculcated Bol- sheviK idea among the populace that it was needless to woric any longer. The regular police were unable to handle the situation and 3000 of the citizens were called and armed by the burgomaster to maintain order. A fisht between the riot ers and this cItII Kovernment re sulted In seTeral of th rioters finding that tbe conditions con tinued to be crave, then applied to the armistice commission to hasten the allied occupation. The troubles ceased with the ap pearance of the troops yesterday. To day, a cordon of British forces was thrown ont from the city along the itnine. Affairs More Smoothly. Affairs In Cologne now are moving smoothly, to all outward appearances. Burgomaster Adenauer, however, told the correspondent that the city was facing starvation, as only one week's supply of food was In sight. Colosrne is accentlne the occu nation as a real hardship, although the Brlt- isn are being treated courteously. The burgomaster was particularly aggrieved at the proposed new rules, compelling the people to keep in their houses between 8 oclock In the eve ning and 6 in the morning and requir ing the men to lift their hats to the British officers. "Unable to Run City. He declared he would be unable to run the city if business were allowed to be conducted only during the hours thus specified. However, he issued a proclamation to tbe residents, urging tnem to maintain order and show civility to the British, while still re membering that they were Germans. When the burgomaster's atten tion was directed to the harsh, treatment of the people In the areas the German forces had been occupying. he declared that Cologne had consistently opposed the German doings In Belgium and France. "We expect the English would be; better." he added. "When informed j that many of the newly evacuated dis tricts were In virtually a starving! condition and that aid was being i rushed to the Impoverished people he j expressed much surprise. He said: Many Hare Tuberculosis. "As far as I have been able to gath-! er from newspapers, England did not; believe that Germany was starving ; but the outside world cannot imagine what the German population In the big cities suffered during the last four ! years. The soldiers were better fed. but the civilians, especallly of thej poorer classes were undernourished. 1 The mortality through tuberculosis : i increased 300 percent in Cologne and the Infection from tuberculosis, even : among the better classes, was much , greater than this, due to undernour-, Ishment and other war causes.

By DAVID BREST. France, Dec 10. Neither fog nor rain nor mud, of which there Is an abundance here, can obscure or suppress various emotions which the wayfarer encounters at this the gate way to France. Hero daily thousands of American soldiers pass homeward. some sick, some disabled, many more robust than before, happy over the! war they have wbn. Here will arrive Friday, en route to Paris, president Wilson to help con summate the victory of arms by an enduring peace. Here sits admiral Wilson, who for months has routed convoys and transports in the great est game of hide and seek ever nlaved on the seen seas. With characteristic frankness he tells the story of how the premature armistice report was flashed, sending America into spasms of hysterical delight. The truth is the admiral, himself, gave out the news, having received It officially from the American embassy in Paris. Good naturedly the admiral smiles. recollecting the enjoyable time every body here had celebrated. The little town is now alive again in expecta tion of the distinguished guest soon to arrive, when patriotic societies will line the streets and the docks and collect at the railroad station while American troops police the thorougn fares through which president Wilson passes. This Is a socialist town, ana so It may be said that president Wilson will be received, first by the radicals of Europe. But while Mr. Wilson is soon to pass on to Paris, there to reconcile differences and smooth out friction, nevertheless, Brest will remain the goal for millions of American troops and the center of many American hearts, especially those of mothers and sisters, as our big army is sent out through this, the principal, . of three ports of exit on the AUantio seaboard.

To Have Largest Staff In Paris For Peace Meeting; All Nations May Have 5000 rjARIS. France, Bee. 10. Every trail I arriving at Paris these days brings large numbers of officials attached to the various delegations to the peace conference. By the time the delegates gather, the number of officials of all nationalities will number between 3000 to 5000. Bach one will have some special work to do. Many of them are already busy. The United States, because of Its remoteness, will be obliged to have probably the largest and most complete staff and for this reason the American authorities have been compelled to take over larger accommodations than any other delegation. Italy -will also have a considerable working force here, but the delegates. as In the case of Great Britain, will be able to depend on much of their work being done In their own country. Each. European nation's dele gates vrill hare at their disposal their own private telegraph and telephone wires, with which they may communicate with their re spective governments. A large number of the officials of the leading powers arc receiving many representatives of small na- tlonalltles. or groups of nationalities,! who have interests which they intend! to bring before the conference, iome of these represent governments which j have not even been recognized, andi few cases there are two groups of representatives of the same na tionality, each claiming to represent the majority party. ' Sea Freedom His: Issue. London. Eng.. Dec. 10. One of the greatest problems at the peace con ference will be based on what Is meant by "freedom of the seas," and what concessions Great Britain is go ing to make in that direction, said Sir Frederick K. Smiih, attorney gen eral, in a speech at Liverpool yester day. He added that he was engaged in preparing a memorandum on the subject for the war cabinet. "America has rendered brilliant service In the canse of civiliza tion.9 Sir Frederick said -and Great Britain Is bound to ap proach the conference with a de termination to concede every thing possible to American senti ment and American views, hav Intz record for national security and existence of the empire. "Americans must remember that the seas are free to every one in peace time and that to none has that free dom been denied. In time of war, however, one might as well talk of the freedom of tbe land as the free dom of the seas. What Britain May Say.

It is the In tention to accomodate at least 75.000 troops here at one time and provide adequate hospital facilities for thera. aitnouga it is tnougnt that the sick rate will be very low. Every effort is being made by Gen. Helmlck to give comforts to the returning sol diers and while It Is impossible to fur nish the men with everything that might be desired, conditions will be Infinitely better than upon their ar rival. In this connection, my own Impres sion is that the American people ought to realize the necessity of sustaining the splendid policy of secretary Baker and Gen. March, In declining to permit political influence of any sort to gov ern the selecting of the home going contingents. Nothing Is more exasperating to the thousands of veterans after a year in the trenches than to see a newly arrived regiment ordered back to America through special Influence. Troops should go back to the Cnlted States In Inverse er- ! der to their arrival In France. The sick and wounded are already being given preference, but of course '. many transports are unsulted to carry these men and it is the natural desire of all the others to be the first ones. to start for home Brest to Be Chief Port. Secretary Baker throughout the war has given Gen. Pershing and his over seas officers the greatest leeway and aufeuiuieiy xi u pumjcai pre&sare nas been permitted. Therefore, he has. the confidence of the overseas troops, who believe a similar policy will be for warded henceforth.

President Wilson probably will not sit at the peace table, but will be represented there by delegates while remaining in close contact -with the heads of the other nations and prepared to decide ques tions referred to him.

President Wilson's disposition is in favor of entirely public proceedings, such as are carried on in the senate chamber at Washington, with the press representatives given every fa cility to report certain business. Naturally, there will be need of se crecy, as there is In the foreign re lations committee, but the president's idea is that the procedure could be much the same as at Washington. committee considering the confiden tial and delicate features of various questions and then reporting back to the peace congress for action.

Money is needed, also elothinj and food. While The Herald started its Rescue Home fund to give the children a merry Christmas, it has grown until each year the good people of the city contribute to help buy clothing, bedding and other necessities. Each year, this help is looked forward to by the Rescue Home management as a means of replenishing the things worn out during the year and it famishes warm blankets, dean sheets, new stockings, new underwear and new elothes for the litUe unfortunate boys and girls who are inmates. Money is most desired, but contributions of clothing, bedding and food will be acceptable. Contributions of toys will also be received with thanks, as Santa Claus must have these things to make Christmas merry for the little ones. Contributions should be sent to The Herald, and they will be acknowl edged in these columns. The monies are spent nnder the direction of The Herald and accurate account is kept. of all transactions. AH of the last Christmas fund was exhausted some time ago, owing to the heavy calls upon the institution this year because of sickness.

Great Britain win use all her Influence to make the league o' nations & powerful reality, but st--cannot regard it as a substitute fo' her own navy in any measureable pt -riod of time. Winston Spencc Churchill, the minister of munitions, declared In an article contributed thj Glasgow Sunday Post In hfs article, Mr. Churchill pea!- of Great Britain's unique position affloc- the nations of the world. "Onr safety from invasion, our dal! bread, every means whereby we main tain our existence as an independent people: our unity as an empire o- federatlon of commonwealths: and de pendencies all these float from hour to hour upon our naval defence." Mr Churchill writes. Sees Continued Dangers. "If that defence is neglected, weai - ened or fettered, he continues, "we shall, be fh continnal dane-er or .iK Jugatlon or starvation. We shoul'1 be forced to live in continued anxiet If that naval defence were overpow ered, or outmatched, by any other navy, or probably by a commission o' cavies, we should hold, not merely our possessions, but our lives and liberties only on suxrerance. "Where else In the whole world ca such conditions be paralleled? We have the' right to demand from all other nations, friends and foes al!k full recognition of those facts. We realize and are entitled to point on that this naval strength that we re quire, and which we are determined to preserve, has never been used in modern history In a selfish and ag gressive manner. Policy Proved Good. "In this greatest of all wars, the British navy shielded mighty America from all menace of serious danger, and when she resolved to act It was the British navy that transported and escorted the greater proportion 6f her armies to the rescue and deliver ance of France. Our record in a hun dred years of unquestioned naval sway since Trafalgar proves the so briety of our policy and the righteous ness of our intentions. "We are sincere advocates of a league of nations. Every Influence Britain can bring to bear will be used to make such a league a pow erful reality. This fine conception of president Wilson has been warmly welcomed by British democracies all over the world. We shall strive faith fully and loyally to carry It into be- . ing. But we must state quite frank ly that a league of nations cannot be for us a substitute for the British navy in any period that we can foresee."
