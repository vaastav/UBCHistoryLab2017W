Tlie Keeeut Tariff fourMUoa la Mow York* The L-dilor ol this paper returned home yesterday li? ? few days visit to the East. While there lie attended the sittings of the National Turiir Convention in New York. Theproeecdinipi of that body'were very in-, differently reported in the Sow York news piU-re. New York is lately a free trade city, Mil villi tile election of the Tribune the leading l'ni>er? sympathise with free Hide idt'iu. This is conspicuously thecaso with I he I If raid, Timet ami Pott, The vast imiwrting interest of that city controls public opinion, anil shapes the toue of the press. The heavier the importations the better for New York, is the way they reaiOQ. Hence every paper read before tha Convention?no matter how Important? ms pooh pooliod as of little value. Some ol these papers were of great value, as also were tome of the short "experience" speeches, as they wcro callcd, In regard to t'ic prui tical working of protection to American manufacture* anil American lilwr. Fur iustanco, tho short schedule read by John Itoach, the great iblp builder, \uis full of meat Ho ehowo-1 bin roach money ono largo ship builder paid out In ono year for American mailt' goods with which to equip a vessel, lie iliowed tiiu amount paid lor furniture, {ur uphoIsterintCi for table ware, for carpets, curtains, rope*, chains and varioua other commodities- ainountingto millions in the ggrrgatc all of widch was loat to the country in tho caso of foreign-built ships. He allowed that with tho singlo exception ol wages paid for labor we could build ilii|? us cheap as England could build tliein, und bo asked tho question, with grrnt point, whether we wanted to compoto witli Iter in the matter of wages. Another pointed speech was that made by Mr. Jarrott, the President of the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers, who on behalf of tho 03,000 laboring men belonging to that association presented to the Convention the reasons for tho fiiitb that was in thcin as friends of tho Uriir. .Mr. Jarrctt is an Engllahman by birth, but a thorough going American in ill Ins feelings and sympathies, and gave a vivid picture of the difference between an English and American workingtnan. Ilo Uinaelf worked (or many years In a rolling mill as a boiler, and speaks from a largo experience. Another very forcible and commanding ipeecli was that nude by Col. Scrivens, of Savannah, On., an ex-slnvcholdcr and exConfederate, who said that ho rejoiced now In the overthrow of slavery and at tho com ins ol it new Poulli?n south turn wan to become great, rich and powerful liko tlio I Nurili, tliroiifjli llio protection, education j ml elevation of lior laborers. Hespoko ( on behalf of tJio rlco interest, and presented ( > shurt paper of great value to tlio Convenlion. < A delegate from Waterbury, Connecticut, <b<we name wo do not recall, made a most excellent live minute's speech, In which he drew a picture of the homes of the workingmen of that largo manufacturing city that -wiliI have dono honor to an artist. He ipokoof the great change that had go no on ' In tlio last twenty years under his own I eye?, and summed up the argument for < protection In these words: "Wo havo In- i creased production and wages nnd cheap- I fned the goods right along to consumers. ! Our production Is greater than over?our < nnges one half higher than twenty years ' ago. ami our goodspne half cheaper." Like speeches were mado by various rop- ' rMontatlves of tho many Interests ropre lentcd in tlio convention. One of tho best i wm that of George II. taring, tho United i Slutis Commissioner of Agriculture, who I itibmittcd statistics of great value In re- ' gird to the growth of tho cotton, woolen, I (ilk, shoe and leather, wheat nnd flour and < iron and steel Industries. Wo had In- ' cmued the growth of wool from 08,000,000 ] of pounds In 18(10 to 250,000,000 Jn 1880, ml the amount paid to those engaged In ' Its manufacture from $0,000,000 per year to 1 413,000,000. The aggregate annual product j of our innmifactlng and mechanical Industries Is now more than six thousand millions ohlollars. Oftlils vast product less than two i hundred millions are exported.

Tho venerable i'ctor Cooper?now 01 I years old the great philanthropist of New I Yock city, who gave the Cooper Institute to the poor of that city, mado a speech In i which ho related ills observations since the *ar of 1812, in the matter of industrial , production. Ono of his terse utterances *M this observation: "Tlioro Is nothing that can be said to be purchased cheap ' <ruiu loruign countries uiiu muni uu uuu^ui t Iho expcnao of leaving our own labor unemployed and onr own row material 0 mined," 1 Sccrotnry lllalno lent tlio followlngahort ml painted letter to the Convention, which heard with great Intcroat by the delegates: Dkpartmrmt or Statu, \ W??imsoto*i November 28,1881./ Mv lir.tn Sia: My official duilea prevent me (loin leaving Washington at this time. 1 am tluTofdro deprived of saving dome tliinpi which I wotlld bo glad to nay In your Convention, If 1 had the opportunity totpeak. In ii lirlef nolo of eaciiao I cannot dinetiaa tlic Intiir or tlie chipping question. Ami yet 1 will not omit the ejprcaalon of my belief, that In no prevloua lime In the hUlciry of our coutilry ha? tho principle of protection to American Indnitry been so "trong with tho mam** of the people a? to-ilny. 11 waa formerly an lamia somewhat determined by latitude and longitude; but Inwe liniltntionn have piNH away and enllniiliiillc protect lohlitf can now be found in Alabama as well aa In Maaaaehusetta? in llliiiuia aa well aa In Pennsylvania.

We are paying to Bnull annually Brat* than tlb,000,000 in gold coin to settle the balance of trade against us. Brazil in turn ends this money to Europe to pay for conimoililsea which wi ought in part, at least, to furnish her. It in easy for the merchant* of Brazil to reach England and France. We have never seen the wisdom of providing an easy luodo for the same merchants to come to tlio United States. So long as we fail to do so the balance of tiwlo will annually Increase against us. It is idle to think of Belling goods to a luan unless you first Induce him to como into your store. In great haste, yours very truly, James G. Buisii. One of the wittiest speeches (yet very solid) made in tho Convention was that of John II. Ricketson, of Pittsburgh, it presented many strong points iu favor of a careful revision of the tnri|l?, showing liov? arbitrary rulings and decisions had wrought great mischief to certain manufactures, for instance tho hoop iron brunch. On this point he made the following very just remark: "I cannot see how a jury of average intelligence, under the instruction of a (airminded American judge, euu fail to And that hoop iron is hoop iron, whether cut into long or short lengths, mid whether loose buckles are strung on one out of thirty of the strands ill n bundle, or are (listened with an unnecessary rivet.

Mr. Iticketsou closed up his vury able ind interesting! sncecii with tho following ibservations: Mr. President und gentlemen, we are :?ere to-duy in Convention assembled to renew our nllcgianco to the great prineiplo )f Protection to-American Industry. We uelieve that it has accomplished all that its uivocates claimed for it in the early days >( the Uepubiic. Wo believe that the time when it cun be safely abandoned is still fur Jistant.

The Protective system has developed >ur great natural resources, and given us a oreniost place among the nations of the arth. It has secured to tho country that 'csult, which in the object of all govern* nont, tho greatest good of tho greatest lumber of our people. It has encouraged ntcrnal improvement; it lias bridged our ivers, and given us iron and ate* I pathways from tho granaries of tho West to iide-water, and. if applied in proper form, a American ships, will ro-establish our merchant murine.

C., December 7.?Secrc tary Folger granted u hearing to-day t persons interested as to the amount of dut; properly chargeable on imported stee blooms. The caso was brought up on ai appeal of H. Collins, of Pittsburgh, frou the decision of un appraiser at New York charging 2} cents per pound specific dutj on 2,800 steel blooms for rails imported foi Carnegie Bros., of the Edgar Thomson Stee Works at Pittsburgh, instead of 45 per ceni ad valorem, which Air. Collins cluimt should have been churged under the ruling of tlio Department in September lust. Botli the importersund manufacturers of bloom* wero represented at the hearing. There it u general desire on thu part of both classes of dealers that the Department ?hall take Homo action which will hu linal and irrevocabie, thus removing the question of the rate of duty from thu uncertainty which at present surrounds it. 

INTERESTED 1'ARTIES PRESENT. There were ]>resent at the couferenco with tho Secretary to-day, Assistant-Seen:tary French, II. K.Collins, D. J. Morrell, of Johnstown, Mr. l'ost, of Clark, I'ost ?fc Martin, importers, New York, and their attorney, Air. Ueamun, of tho firm of Evnrts, Southmayd A Choate, and Mr. Knock, Superintendent of tho Homo, N. V., rail mills, representing tho importers, and James Park, Jr., and J. D. Weeks, of Pittsburgh, on behalf of tho manufacturers. Congressmen Errett and Slmllenberger attended tho meeting. Mr. Collins stated his caso to tho Secretary. Ho had lost $20,000 on tho importation cited above by the ruling of the appraiser, lie claimed that tho precedent established by tho Department had been departed from in charging 21 cents spntifle duty instead of -ir> per cent nd valorem. THE 

SKCRKTABV'S OPINION. ' Secretary Folger interrupted tho proceedings by calling tho attention of tho gentlemen to a statute which prohibits the Secretary of tho Treasury from modifying tho Llecision of his predecessor in ofllce in a manner adverse to the interests of tho Qovornment, without the concurrence of the Attorney General, and said that until tho question of what would be adverse to the interests of tho Government had been settled, it would be useless for the gentlemen to continue their arguments. Jt was always assumed that the higher rate of duty would in creese the revenue, and, therefore, bo advantageous to the Government. THE ARGUMENTS It was decided dually to go on with the hearing. Mr. Morrell stated the case of Godfrey vk Co., of tho Cambria Iron Works. They had imported f>10 blooms. lie claimed that tho collectors had, by mistake, assessed rail blooms as steel-wire blooms, which are required to pay a specific duty. Mr. Beaman made a long argument, going into the history of iron and steel manufactures in tho United States and Europe. Ho analysed tho meaning of the terms ingots, loops, blooms, Ac. He said that prior tq tho decision of 1870, fixing an ad valorem duty on blooms, Mr. Morrell had done all that ho could to havo tho rate changed to a specille duty, but had now found it to be to his interest tliut tho rate should be nd valorem. Under tho September decision of tho Department it was required that rail blooms should weigh six hundred pounds each, although blooms wero required for the construction of rails weighing as low as ninety pounds, and from that weight up to i>icrlil IuiikIi-ikI timmrlfl Tlift rliffitriinnn in duty was between $l!l 110 per ton at llio mi valorem rale, and $30 00 per ton at the specific rate. Till! HARDSHIPS WOIHEKD. IIo clalmcd that the RjicciDc duty was prohibitory. Clark, Post and Martin, Mr. Ilcamnn said, liad mado contracts (or 20,000 blooms, weighing MO pounds cadi, and if tlio specific duty was Imposed upon their Importation It would bo a terrible hardship to thein. Mr. lloatnnn claimed that under the tariff law of 180-1, 1'rcntod at n time wlicustcolbloomnwercuuhcnrd of, blooms should Iw admitted under "forms of steel not otherwise provided for," at n rate of not less tlmn 30 per cent, nor more than 45 per cent ai valorem. Mr. Ilcyman contended that, as on the faith of tlio Treasury ruling of 18711, Importers hail brought In hundreds of thousands of blooms, and manufacturers can not make them fast enough at homo to supply the demand, It would ho Millions to the manufacturers and railroads alike to liavo the rate of duly changcd. The revenuo from these importations, amountIngto between six or sewn million dollars annnallv, would cciue. Mr, Knock, who represents a mill which manufactures tlio Improved blooms, said that with the higher rate of duty, his mill must close. Mr. Collins contended for a fixed and permanent rate of duty. 1 le sided with the Impnrtcrs, of course, in (ho case under discussion. A IIO l' Jl EST IX FWOtl SPEC IFIC DITV. Mr. Weeks nrgtiwi In favor of the specific rale of duty. He contended that when the tariff laws of 1801 were enacted, blooms were unknown. The.v were then classified as Ingots to pay a specific duty ol2) cents per pound, lllooinshad superseded Ingots and should bear tlio samo rato of duty of wlmlover weight or for whatever purpose they might bo Imported. Mr. Park said that he was about to build a new mill and therstabllshmcntof a fixed tariff on blooms was a matter of general ini|Hirtanee. Capllal hail been Invested In the manufacture nl blooms under the guar n litre tluitttic tnrllTwould protect tlio iimiiufsrturcs.
