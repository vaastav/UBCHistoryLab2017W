"While all the football games scheduled f pr this year have been played, the sea son is by no means over. There will be discussions for months now as to who are entitled to positions on the all col lege teams for the various sections of the country. Due de ' Chaulnes, the French fiance of Miss Theodora Shonts. is a most remarkable foreigner. He Is re ported to have returned to France in "fine spirits" and a merry mood. And Mr. Shonts let him understand that no bonus would be paid him for relat ing the family to nobility. The proposal of a call on the national banks by the comptroller of the cur rency as to their condition on a recent date, is a good suggestion.. It would ' probably show large reserves in the great majority of these institutions and this would tend to restore confidence among depositors. Let's have it. . Word comes from all the big money centers that the currency situation is so , Improving that the banks will soon meet their obligations with cash. And the dispatches say that real money will soon be a drug on the market- This is cheering , news for the. hordes of this particular brand of drug fiends In this country. A cartoon in the Washington Star pictures Bryan as a sculptor standing before a marble pedestal on which Is the. "affinity" of the Democratic party, a donkey. Inscribed "on the . pedestal is The King of Beasts." The elephant of the G. O. P. is in a fainting condi tion In a corner. .What a story the pic ture tells? Augusta. Ga., sticks a big finger in the federal "pork" barrel. It is de manding that the Savannah river be deepened and made navigable for ocean going boats. Won't the con gressmen have a merry time in satis fying all localities when they start In appropriating money for the real im provement of inland waterways? , With the wealth created by agricul ture placed at $53,000,000,000 and with the value of crops for the last year $857,000,000 greater than the hlghwater mark of last year, the pessimist, who has been seeing disaster threatening the prosperity of this country because of a little money flurry, has looked through mighty poor glasses. He'd better con sult an oculist. Dan R. Anthony, of Leavenworth, our particular congressman, will contest honors with Andrew J. Barchfleld of Pittsburg; Pa., as the tallest man of the house of representatives. Every one believes that Mr. Anthony will eon test honors along other lines with con gressmen of worth and that he will measure up with them in many ways besides stature. Wawhington dispatches report the national legislators to be all at sea concerning important legislation that may be enacted at the coming ses sion of congress. They always are en the eve of a session. Frequently hey stay at sea until after adjourn ment. Then they scatter to their homes and ask to be sent back again on the records of what they tried to do. Novelties In Jurisprudence are not rare In this country. A rather unusual one developed in Brooklyn the other day. The testimony of a blind man concerning a fight waa admitted as good evidence. -To be sure, he did not see much of It but he was familiar with the voices of the parties to the icrap and told of the arguments lead tot; up to It. He also heard the impact at the blowa, PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Some forecasts of what "President Roosevelt's message was to be, which have been sent. out broadcast by the Washington correspondents those who always take it upon themselves to speak with "authority" have inti mated that Mr. Roosevelt would deal with a delicately gloved hand with all of the important financial and com mercial questions' which are before the public today for solution,, and on which the president was known to have such .pronounced views. As is usual with the work of prophets these prognostications are proved to be wrong by the message itself which was delivered to both branches of congress today. During the last year every agency under the control of the Wall street crowd was utilized to impress upon the people the belief that constant criticisms of corporations by the president and his declaration in favor of radical steps for their regulation had resulted in unsettling the finan cial world and the Impairing of pub lic confidence in the soundness of railroads, banks and the great indus trial corporations. The recent incipi ent panic in Wall street, the ramifica tions of which have been felt through out the country, has given this crowd an opportunity to yell "I told you so!" And it seemed to be quite a general teiief that the president would back down to some extent on some of the stands he has taken. But he has not. backed down one lota In the progres sive 'policies he has inaugurated for the reasonable regulation of railroads and omniverous corporations. For this firm stand, the people as a whole will applaud. The message is couched in a little more temperate language than Mr. Roosevelt is accustomed to use in his speeches. But It is none the less strong and firm. On the whole it is a sober, dispassionate and conservative treatment of existing conditions in the commercial world with pronounced and pertinent remedial suggestions. But there is not a line in it which can be construed as showing a scintilla of wavering on the part of the presi dent in the policies he has in augurated. . He asks congress in unmistakable words to strengthen the laws relative to the federal regulation of railroads and he asks that anti-trust laws- be so strengthened as to effectually curb rapacious corporations, combinations of them, and monopolies. There is little discussion In the message of the recent panic in Wall street and the resulting financial stringency throughout the country. In his opening paragraph Mr. Roosevelt states that In no nation "are the busi ness conditions sounder than in ours at this very moment." This is fol lowed with a- dissertation on the fact dishonesty is bound to creep into the business affairs of every large body of men and that when misdeeds of suc cessfully dishonest men . are dis covered, suffering comes not only on them but upon the Innocent' men whom they have misled. , "There may be honest differences of opinion," say the president, "as to many governmental policies; but sure ly there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinching persever ance in the war against successful dishonesty." Further on in the message under a discussion headed "Currency," Mr. Roosevelt touches on . the financial situation and money . stringency by saying "We need a greater elasticity in our currency, provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the national authori ties. Provision should ; be made for an emergency currency. The emer gency Issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securities approved by the government,- and must be Issued under a heavy tax. It would permit currency being Issued when the demand for It was urgent, while securing its retirement as the demand fell oft. It is worth investi gating to determine whether officers and directors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companies should be subject to the same supervision as banks; legis lation to this effect should be enacted for the District of Columbia and the territories." In his suggestions for the strength ening of the anti-trust laws the presi dent would bar any corporation ot monopoly from foreign or Interstate commerce that is formed for the pur pose of or the control of any one or more of the prime necessities of life. He also believes that corporations do ing an interstate business should either be chartered or licensed by the federal government. Through either of these mediums the government can gain supervision over them. On the Important question of the tariff, which will likely be one of the paramount issues in the next presi dential campaign, the president as serts that this country is definitely committed to the protective system and any effort to uproot it would cause widespread and Industrial disaster. He believes, however, that the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized and changed to suit con ditions as they develop. But he thinks that such a revision of the tar iff as may be needed can not with wis dom be dealt with in the year preced ing a presidential election, because ex perience has conclusively shown that at such a time It is impossible to get men to treat It from the standpoint of the public good. In his Judgment the wise time to deal with the matter Is immediately after such election. In connection with this subject of tariff revision but during his discus sion of the necessity of preserving the forests of the land Mr. Roosevelt in sists that there should be no tariff on any forest product grown In this country, and In especial, there should be no tariff on wood pulp. The re peal of the duty on wood pulp which would be of such Just benefit to the users of paper In this country should, if possible, the president thinks, be accompanied by an agreement wltn Canada that there shall be no export duty on Canadian pulp. President Roosevelt believes that railroads should be permitted to en gage In pooling under governmental supervision. He favors a postal sav ings banks' system and also an exten sion of parcel posts, especially on the rural routes. He urges the enactment of a strong employers' liability law which will protect the employes of the government as well as those of cor porations, a law that will be such that the payment for accidents by the em ployer will be automatic instead of being a matter for lawsuits.. Mr. Roosevelt is emphatic that in come and Inheritance taxes should be incorporated Into the government's system of taxation. He favors the ex tension and strengthening of the eight hour labor law, the pure food law and the child labor law. . He also asks for the enactment -of legislation that will provide for a comprehensive system of deepened inland waterways. He insists that Alaska be given local self government and that the rights of citizenship be extended to the peo ple of Porto Rico. " As to Cuba, the president thinks that within the com ing year it will be possible to turn the island over again to a government chosen by the people thereof. The president asks that the size of the standing army, be Increased to a peace footing where , it would form a skeleton for a large army. He also urges that the pay of officers and en listed men be increased. On the sub ject of the navy, the president argues that there should be no let up in Its development so as to place this coun try on a proper footing with other world powers. He thinks that provl sion should be made this year for four more battleships and for many needed auxiliaries, as well as for adequate docks and coaling stations: He asks for liberal treatment for . the officers and men of the navy. Mr. Roosevelt also favors a ship subsidy for American built boats for the primary purpose of improving the ocean mail service. Concerning law enforcement, espe cially as it relates to corporations and their officials, Mr. Roosevelt says it la far more preferable to punish the prime offender by imprisonment rath er than to fine the corporation with the attendant damage to stockholders. On the question of campaign con tributions to political parties, Mr. Roosevelt urges publicity and then goes on with the suggestion which ho admits to be radical, that the need of colectlng large campaign funds with possible attending scandals would vanish if congress provided an appro priation for the proper and legitimate expenses of each of the great national parties. an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thor ough organization and machinery which requires a large expenditure of money. There are a variety of other topics discussed and suggestions made by Mr. Roosevelt, such as, some facts about the progress of the Panama canal work; the need of making the life of farmers and wage earners more attractive; an extension of the reclamation work; a conserving of the public lands; the arbitrary investiga tion of serious labor disputes by the government; our foreign relations which are styled as most cordial and even to the establishment of a nation al art gallery which Is strongly urged. The message on the whole Is a wonderfully able and interesting document, which is well worth the perusal and thought of each and every citizen in the land, even though it is most voluminous. There's just a suspicion that those interested in almanacs are fond of dates and chestnuts. It's well to remember that health is not benefited by overexertion either In work or in play.

Indeed,' Is it,' that paternalism has not developed in this country to such an extent as to maka it a case of lese majeste for everyone who could not recite the president's message verbatim within a week of its publication. - An Augusta blacksmith advertises himself as a horse chiropodist. That's going some. This was a foul deed. Frank How ell, who owns the fruit farm just east of Amarron, had fifty hens stolen last Thursday night. The Robinson Whitewater Falls Stock farm received a shipment last week of ten Percherons imported di rect from France. E. A. Wlninger brought a handful of volunteer spring wheat to St. Fran cis a few days ago that was well filled and promised a good yield. Who can beat that for November? C. N. Higglnson of the Belle Plaine Gazette has moved his plant to Udall and consolidated it with the News of that place. This gives J. Byron Cain a clear field again at Belle Plaine. Gus W. Brune of Douglas county claims the corn husking champion ship of the state. He is credited with husking one hundred and forty-one bushels in a few minutes less than ten hours. William Carey of Lawrence certain ly had a few worrying thoughts. He's been hallucinating for some time that friends were about to blow him to smithereens with dynamite. Bill is to go to a state hospital for treatment. While gathering corn one day re cently on one of his father's farms south of Udall. Ernest Klser came across a very freaked stalk of corn. It had ears from bottom to top. seven ty in number. - Each ear " was well grained and about the pop corn size. A short distance from this stalk he found another one with forty ears very much like the first. If this doesn't sound good write to the Udall News about It 

JOURNAL ENTRIES ! " " ' "' j JAYHAWKER JOTS j KANSAS COMMENT WATCHING THE CLOCK. There are sundry bewhiskered max ims which go yammering through the newspapers year after year. One of them is to the effect that the young man who watches the clock win never amount to much in this world. The truth is that the really valuable young man takes careful note of the clock; for punctuality is among ' the chief of human virtues, and one that cannot be property cultivated without proper communion with the clock. The useful -man is as prompt to quit work as he is to begin it; in order to do his best, he must have his meals and his recreation at regular Intervals, and so he watches the clock- Many horrible railway accidents have occur red because operators and station agents and engineers didn't watch the clock; there are; many bungling clock doctors who might- be -expert workmen had they watched the clock. None of this is of the least import ance; it is merely a futile protest against a : weary ..chestnut. Emporia uazette. A PROPHECY.

CORRECT. '" Of all forms of murder there Is none more detestable than the deliberate killing of human 'Ibejtigs in order to collect their 'life insurance. This is a crime of which three American resi dents in Mexico have been onvicted by the courts of that country; after a series of reviews in which their case is said to have come before the high est tribunal of that 'republic. Since their victims were also Americans it does not appear why the United States should interfere unless proof is ad vanced that they were not fairly tried. The state department is reported to have investigated ' the matter and to have decided substantial Justice had been done. Yet it is alleged that nu merous appeals have been sent to Washington demanding action. If the facts are as they are represented, the course of our own government seems perfectly correct.

Shrinking the Nation. A curious little game of figures and time tables has' been played recently by French statisticians of the depart ment of public works to show how France' has been shrinking, in- effect, year by year since 1814. The conclu sion is that under present facilities of travel the France of today, as against that of almost a century ago, is of about the- size of the department of Seine-and-Oise, the department in cluding Paris and measuring perhaps sixty-five miles by forty. As applied to France, thfs is a com paratively simple game of hours, minutes, and miles. With the United States as the territorial subject of the play, one may be dazed by the variety and amazing character of the results. Nor is it necessary to go so far back for comparisons as to those ante-railroad days when it took more time to cross half the continent than a mod ern traveler devotes to a personally conducted tour of the Old World. In 1857 Buffalo was fifteen hours from New York. Chicago is now but eighteen hours away, where fifty years ago it was thirty-five. The Twentieth Century flyer now makes Buffalo in about eight hours. So in half a cen tury the Empire state has lost half its size almost, and the hustling Cook county metropolis has been drawn very, close to the 1857 borders of this commonwealth.' That is one way of playing this figurative game of shrinkage. - - New Orleans in 1836 was twelve days and a half from New York, if one traveled north, or thirteen days eight nours if one traveled south. It is now but thirty-two hours away. , .Within. tne time of the old trip one may come from the Crescent Citv to Mannauan sail to England in the Lusltania. and nave several fine days in iionaon. Not so manv vears ago San Fran. Cisco was a solid week from New York. Today it is ninety-six hours away, and the railroads propose to cut thirty hours from that distance. At fifty miles an hour this contemplated further shrinkage would represent 1,500 miles, which would bring the Golden Gate a little soutn oi tne pres. ent location of Des Moines. It may well alarm Mr. Bryan to think how closely and permanently this would brine- his beloved Lincoln. jNeo.. into touch with "the enemy's country." New York World. Bits of Information.
