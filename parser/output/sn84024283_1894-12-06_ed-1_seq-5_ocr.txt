Sateredin the PostoSce at I ronton, Mo.,u second class matter. E. D. AKE. : : Editor. Volume XXVIIl.' N cubes 23. IEONTOH, KO. THURSDAY. DEC. 6. 1894. LOCAL BREVITIES. The drought is broken. The frost is on the pumpkin-vine. The Fontanas were a flash i' the pan. Delayed communications will appear next week. It is rumored that Arcadia is to have a new station house. The invitations for the K. P. Masque Ball will be issued this week. Thanksgiving dinner services were well and numerously attended. The Ironton station house was paint ed outside ahd inside last week. Two dead engines, and 'several cars of wreckage passed up the road Mon day last. Regular meeting of Star of the West Lodge, No. 133, A. F. & A. M., Satur day evening this week. The President's message was given to Congress Monday and will be print ed in the Register next week. The darkest day in fronton's history was last Saturday. All day long those who needed better light in their work consumed the erstwhile midnight oil. We are informed that a party i3 look ing up some valuable mining proper ties in Iron and Madison counties with a view of developing same in the near future. Dandruff is due to an unfeebled state of the skin. Hall's Hair Renewer quickens the nutritive functions of the skin, healing and preventing the for mation of dandruff. County Cdurt is in session at regu lar term. Judges Hill and Hart trans acting the business. We regret to have to state that ill health prevents Judge Holloman's attendance. We are informed that some pros pecting is being done on land near the Silver Mountain mine in Madison coun ty. The discovery of rich copper and und other ores was made some time ago. On Friday night, the 7th inst., a box-supper will be given for the bene fit of Saint's Delight Church, near by the Fisher schoolhouse, two aiid a half jailed east of Ironton.

It t-as built by the Gay Co , of t&U City, v.vA painted by Pruitt & Madigua. Just oaa year ago yesterday morn ing fire devastated the most closely bailt block in this town and still the debris remains undisturbed. Let us feope for better times to close the un- MQtly gap mat marts me uisasier. Last Saturday two freight trains ran together near jiabula, and a fine smash up" of the euginos resulted. Fortu nately no one was hurt, the engineers aad firemen having sought afety in jumping as soon as they became arc of the condition of things. The Fontanas' advance agent came Here last week, advertised, and went away. The company was to follow and show Tuesday night; and some neat photo-lithographs of a pretty woman in various costumes are hang ing in various public places to indicate hat might have been. The members of the bereaved fami ly desire us to return their heartfelt thanks to the many kind friends and neighbors who agisted them during the long sickness and after the death tot the late Peter Kiddle. Tha many lieU of kindness rendered the affiieusu ones will never be forgotten while memory lasts. The Waters Pierce Oil Company is putting in an iron tank just north of Xhe station house. It will be a great improvement over barrels heretofore eUirad in the wooden building used as an oil bouse; much safer to adjacent property and more sightly, too. The tank will have a capacity of about seventy-five barrels. yhe entertainment given by the $ ronton Public School at the Academy tl M& last Monday evening was well atteo4d. The rendition of the programme va credit to the conduc tor and the pupil, and the audience frequently attested iU approval. The net receipts to be devoted to the library were $16.10. omas Johnson of Berryman, Mo., fefV?re Commissioner Fox oa the 24th itriutnt, charged with retailing intoxicating liquors without having ;fir3t obtained a ilaense from the Gov bnsment. Neither party being ready, the 4;fendant entered a plea, of -not if cilty. nd was bound over to appear befor tL8 Commissioner December 3d. The cause, w &aru, has since been continued to December JOth. a rakeman named Brown was burn ed to ft elnier in a caboose at Bismarck last ThurW.? morning about 3 o'clock. He had retire! fiitothe caboose at mid night, locking tht 4oof after him, and was no doubt asleep wtin tho car took fjre. and it was all ablaze q those utsiie first observed it. His body burned beyond recognition in fact, only the asaos remained when the car fell in and gave his friends an opportu nity to examine the debris. Tfce earth trembled last Saturday eTi bout seven o'clock in response to very tva?J thunder and lightning. One detonatloc caused houses to rock nusd crockery to jiagls in such manner t-hs& many people believed the storm was 8soajpanied with an earthquk.. A gentleman from the country says he was looking out through a window when the loudest fizptosion occurred, and he saw in the northw&st huge ttsJl of fire which flew into fragniU fa approached the horizon. That ay4l& day preceding there fell about three n4 one-half inches of Water. J. be new fast mail train went through on time Sunday morning, putting off at this place over two hun dred pounds of mall matter. The St. Louis morning papers were delivered at once, and many a citizen ate his breakfast and read his favorite daily together, taking in the news from the four quarters of the globe up to the preceding midnight. It is a "big thing" for us of the interior, and great ly lessons the labors of the postmaster at later hours of the day. Services at the Presbyterian church next Sabbath at 10:30 A. m. and 1. p. m. At Graniteviile 3 p. m. Business meeting of the Christian Endeavor So ciety Wednesday evening at 7 o'clock. The Ladies Society will meet at Mrs. Hill's Thursday 2:30 P. M. to complete "quilt." The subjects of the various services will be announced at the time of service. The gentlemen of the town are especially invited to the Sab bath services. If you believe the bible, employ its benefits. Geo. II. Dltv. Pastor. The following item of local interest appeared in the St. Louis Chronicle last Friday: "Shade Sweeney and his fath er, Henry, farmers from Belleview, Iron countv, visited Mamie White's, 602 Elm, at 2 A. m. The boy hid $350 he had in a purse in the sleeve of his shirt. About an hour later be missed it. Sergt. Mansfield raided the house, arresting the keeper and seven in mates." There are no later advices, to our knowledge, and we therefore presume the $350 is gone forever gone glimmering from the despondent to-day, with naught but the lesson it teaches left behind to mark its flight. That lesson demonstrates that a sugar barrel is safer with an industrious honey-bee than is a man's "good cash money" in certain places at 2 o'clock in the morning. And rightly so, for he who dances must not begrudge the pay of the piper. The attorneys who attended the Reynolds county circuit court report a fairly good docket and a thriving bit ters trade. That industry seems to flourish over there, as the docket of Commissioner Fox bears witness. The case of Piles, the defaulting Collector, against A. J. Newton, a former Col lector, was tried, judgment going against Newton for two hundred dol lars. The case of the State against Parks for rape was disposed of by the defendant pleading guilty and a fine of ten dollars being assessed against him, and a sentence of one day in jail, which the court remarked was "not to be constructive imprisonment." Ac cordingly, Mr. Parks sojourned with Sheriff Fisher for twenty-four hours. The case of Snriver against the bonds men of R. Piles, a former Collector, presented some very knotty questions to the court, but was settled by the jury in about five minutes, with a ver dict for defendants. The weather was fine during court, until the last day, when it rained and rruned, as usual, and the attorneys who stayed there until the conclusion, were well ducked on their. homeward trip, as usual. Bro. Flynn of the De Soto Gazette, we fear, is not fully justified in all that he so kindly says of tbo Reoisteh in his write-up of Ironton and its vi cinity; but we make due acknowledge ment, and accept the compliment in the spirit in which it is so neatly given. He discourses as follows; "In our es timation the Ikox County RkuisTEB is the most interesting and reliable insti tution of Iron County. The growth and magnitude of the other enterprises arc n?ere'y proportionate to local de mands whereas the Register has tow ered like a glaufc abQe its surround ings and has made its inijuence felt to thu remotest corners of Southeast Mis souri. For many years, too, its office has practically monopolized the con tracts for fine job work in this portion of the State. There is no other print ing office south of St. Louis that can compete with it in this respect. Though it raay be equaled in point of improved maobib&ry hy one or two other offices, it has no rival in the quantity and variety of its type and other appliances, or in its extensive assortment of excellent paper stock. Itesyjes it has one of the greatest job printing iiiiysgs in the state in the person of its proprietor and editor, Mr. Eli D. Ake. To Mr. Ake alone, is due the credit of having made the Regis ter the most comprehenslvs newspa per in Southeast Missouri. In 18(55, when he was a young man and proba bly a poor one, he started the first pa per in Ironton, the Forge. This he sold during the following year and its name was changed to the Southeast Missouri Enterprise, which continued In publication till 1873. In 1866 a Democratic weekly, the Rcvicic, was started, the name of which was changed in July, 1867. to the Ikox Couxey Reg ister. In May, I8C9, the Register was purchased by Eli D. Ake and C. K. Miller and two years later Mr. Ake became its sole proprietor. Such is a brief outline of the beginning of a pa per which has since grown to be a liv ing monun36ht io the industry, intelli gence and indefatigable energry of Qnp man, a Southeast Missouri editor and printer." We have a friend living not far from Irouton who has a collection of curios la hU library, and amongst them an old army aiiislfet and bayonet on it. A few days ago ho discovered some spots of rust, and took it down iulo iLo kitchen to clean and oil it. He was alone, and put on an old felt hat that lopped over his face somewhat, and an old torn coat. He got spots of rust and grease on his face in the opera tion so that he looked about as desper ate and fierce as a guerilla or a Com anche Indian. At this stage, while rubbing iC?y at his gun. (which was six or seven feet twMg, there was an earnest rap at the door. Holding the gun in his left hand he opened the &;cr quickly with the other; the quick movement toward the door, and the butt of the gun striking a cair, had the effect to thrust the old musket and bayonet out of the door as it opened; and who should be meekly waiting a welcome there but a very dirty and ragged fpmp! Now, this was a most unlookea for" rwption. and the poor tramp's eyes had hardly "bulged cut of his head more than an inch or "two yhen he uttered aery of terror, jumped clear dowt tfcs gteps, tumbled over on the grass, got up and ran like a Turk, making a blue streak until he was out of sight! The calls to "come back, came back," only made him fly the faster, clearing a high paling fence with a bound! The poor tramp has not since been seen in. the country As the tramp ran off, our friend thought he would run around the house the other way and see what became of him. Now, there was an apple tree around there and some small boys happened to stroll there just then look' ing for any stray apples that might be going to waste for want of attention. and our friend, all unconscious of being on the war path, rushed around the corner with his old musket and bayo net, in the very midst of the boys!! Now, to see their hitherto gracious and complacent friend, so suddenly appear in their midst, all begrimed, with a torn coat, musket and bayonet, was a frightful and portentous event. too ominous of impending disaster to be considered or taken under advise ment! In fact, they did not think it required any explanation and they bad no time to make any apology, and so there was no waiting on the order of their going!! They went! They flew!! Calls to "hold on boys, came back, only gave wings to their feet! One little fellow, in throwing himself over a paling fence, tore his pants off, but be held on to them with his hand and disappeared! Afterwards, to the ques tion why he ran so, little Willie re plied, "Jimminy, though! You think I wanted to get poked with that shinin' spear on the end of that big gun? They stick into men in war time You bet I ran!" Gregory Bianton. Married, at the residence of the residence of the bride's father, the Bianton place, Flatwoods, Iron connty, P. M. Gregory.of Fredericktown,Mo.,to Miss Leatrice Bianton. on Thursday, Thanksgiving day, 1894, by Rev W. F. Harmann, of St. Louis, Mo, Only a few of the young friends of the bride and groom were present, except the members of their own family. The bride and groom were dressed in nice, tich materials, with no shoddy, and the dinner that followed the ceremony was such as the Bianton family just ex actly know bow to get up: everything nice and in abundance. Talk about tables groaning; this could not groan. for it was too heavily laden. May long life and happiness follow them all their days! A Friend. Arcadia Hews.

We have had a good rain at last and the ground is deeply penetrated. The ground was extremely dry and we had not had a real good rain since last spring. A Thanksgiving s dinner was indulg ed in by several of our people at their homes, and every one who could pro cure a turkey ate of this most delicious food. Messrs. John Kerwin, Tony Snod grass and Andrew Orrick were so for tunate as to kill a wild turkey for Thanksgiving. The Syenite Granite Company has another small job. It is hoped that they may get the "Kansas City job. The principal of our pubhc school went home to spend Thanksgiving day with his people, and returned Sunday and preached for us, Bro.

Dec. 2, 1894. Didaskolas, AewCoxey. Ed. Register Please publish the fol lowing: Situated in the roughs of the West End, is a mansion lately known as "New Coxey's Fort." Within -this fort dwells a small band known as Coxey's troops. Travelers passing can hear the shouts of the band and see Coxey, drilling his followers in the way of un truthfulness. A short time ago Coxey's troops made a raid on the school which is but a few rods from the fort. They, see ing no prospect of gains, soon returned to the fort and related their disap pointment. This aroused Coxey, and soon the school was astonished by his appearance. Before the school he stood with teeth clattering and trem bling from head to foot. Still trem bling, he is seated without a word, and awaits the dismissing of the school. He is asked to speak. Nothing to say. Dismissed; scholars and teacher pas? out. He calls one scholar aside but receives no satisfaction. A few days later we see Coxey mount ed on his white horse on his way to court. He goes before the Grand Jury and swears that his troops have been cruelly treated by the school. Soon his troops are seeq on their way to court to testify also, I'hey enter and swear. Now is the time for the raid on the treasury. They march in and receive a large sum for the afore said swearing. With the money they buy their winter supply of clothes. Coxey is now satisfied, and returns to his fort and relates the trueness of his troops. Shall we sav hurrah for Cox ey ? The school says not; Nov, 17, 1994. A. A. S. E. M. T. A. On the 20th dav of December, 1877, the Southeast Mo. Teachers' Associa tion convened at Piedmont, and con tinued in session until the evening of the 28th. At this the first session, there were 70 members enrolled. The meeting was one of the most en thusiasm? the writer has atienqeQ. It to the credit of Southeast Missouri that she took the lead in organizing District Associations. Is she still in e lead? The nineteenth session will be held Piedmont, December 26, 27, and 28, next.

The silver jubilee of the Rt. Rev. John J. Hennessy, bishop of Wichita, was celebrated at Wichita. Kansas. Wednesday. November 28th, with much pomp and rejoicing among Cath olics generally. Large numbers of visiting priests and prelates assisted in the ceremonies and participated in the festivities which marked the occasion. Bishop Dunn of Dallas, Tex., preached the pontifical high mass, and Bishop Uonacum of Lincoln, Nebraska., as sisted in the celebration. A telegram of congratulation from Pope Leo read as follows: "To the Rt. Rev. John J. Hennessy: The holy friar has commissioned me to 6end his most cordial congratula tions and wishes to you and your guests and the people committed to your charge. D. J. O'Connel, Rector of American college at Rome." A purse of $4,000 was offered to Bishop Hennessy, but he declined to accept it, and recommended that the money be distributed among the poor. In the afternoon a grand banquet was given in the Bishop s honor. If you are anxious to find the mo3t reliable blood-purifier, read in Ayer's Almanac the testimonials of those who have been cured of such terrible dis ease as catarrh, rheumatism, and scrof ula, by the use of Ayer's Sarsaparilla. Then govern yourself accordingly. "Democrat" Again. Ed. Register You call me a Gold Democrat. I might be one, if I had possession of a large quantity of this so much desired stuff, but as I am a poor man, I sail myself a Gold andSil ver Democrat, and am very sorry that but so small quantities of silver are rolling towards me. I did not intend to have public arguing by my "drop ping a few lines to you," and I confess at once, that I could not follow with the pen. I took them to be an indi- vididual criticism only after the lost battle. As to my view of the silver question, I know, I cannot convince you, and I hardly believe you will con vert me, although we both stand shoulder to shoulder with the great principles of Democracy. Now I hold the free minting of silver is not exact ly a principle of this party at large; it is in my view a temporary issue, orig inated by a lucky rich silvermine shareholder, who earnestly did believe what would be good for him would be good for everybody else. We had be lievers in this doctrine, as well as the inventor of the populist doctrine with his demand for thousands of millions paper dollars, or General Coxey for as sistance of every idler in work and money from the Government, and the consequence was the passage of the Bland bill, with an abundanoe of mint ed silver; thence the Sherman bill with a super abundance of bar silver, and both bills diminished our gold reserve. The platform of the Democratic? party, if I am right, says nothing of free minting of silver, but that the money, the Government issues, gold. 6ilver and paper, must always be of the like value aud of equal buying power, and and the present acknowledged value measure is gold. If gold is only the established standard of Rothschilds and tbo money barons of Europe and America, that they are backed by near ly all civilized nations, is a fact which cannot be denied, and facts must be accounted for. Even the Latin Union of States, with their only silver stand ard, have ceased, and greatly limited the minting of silver coins and make preparations to adopt tha gold standard- Freeminting of silver will bring our country in face of our very small gold reserve to the single silver stand ard at once, our 6mall gold treasury would be emptied in less than no time and the passage of such bills, will set us with our standard money in oppo sition to the other natiqqs, and they will take qur minted silver for the market value of the metal it contain? only, not at its stamped face value, to be saved and stored by them for the purpose to pay a debt to us with our own money. This would be regress instead of progress. Our country, as good and immensely rich as it, ?s tha pride of all its citizens, is not independ ent in itself. We, the citizens, must con sider the laws and ruling usages of the other nations, and in the most import ant question of state welfare, the mon ey question, we must govern ourselves accordingly. The repeal of the Sher man and Blani bills by our party was, in my individual opinions, the great est blessing for our country, avoiding financial crashes and panics, worse than we ever have had them. China walls have fallen, or will fall in a short time. They have enclosed and shut off a population, according to history intelligent and industrious, at a time when from the now most civilized white race nothing could be said. The Chinese have the silver standard, too, although that is of no interest to us at present. In my opinion, the free minting of silver would be for our country like the China walls; we would be among ourselves, how long and with what saorifioe I am unable to say. The direct question you request roe to answer, I will try to answer as well as I am able and understand it. Not being a Goldbug I have not been let into the secret of State financiering. In 1873 the German Empire, next to England, which had the gold standard always, the best customer a.nd, husicesa friend tq qqr. coqntry, adopted the gold Standard., although you. sea daily just like here, more silver than gold circu lating; and our finance authorities per haps calculated it would be wise to bo conformity with these best customers in this question of importance, and may be to-prevent the demonetization of Gold, if silver was 3 per cent, pre: mium over gold. eygn ageqit that gpld, could, be a fiat mogey standard if thre was hut one creditor to present all paper and silver obligations for liquidation; but as there are millions of creditors, such accident never can happen, and gold will retain its capac- TO
