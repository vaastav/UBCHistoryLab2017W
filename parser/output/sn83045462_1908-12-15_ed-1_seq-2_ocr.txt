GIVES RESULT OF INSPECTION Remarks That Armory Accommodations for 1st Battery, Field Artil lery. Are Discouraging. A mass of. interesting data in regard to the organized militia of the various states and territories and the District of Columbia is contained in the first annual report of Lieut. Col. E. M. Weaver. Coast Artillery Corps, as chief of the division of militia affairs of thfe War Department, organised last February.

The organization consists of one brigade, brigade band, corps of field music, artillery, one field battery; infantry. two regiments of twelve companies each; one battalion of four companies, ambulance corps, Bignal corps, naval battalion, four divisions. The report states that the District militia has not adopted the standard of physical examination for niiotmpnt nr re-enlistment as prescribed by War Department circular. February S. 1904. All the troops are armed, uniformed and equipped, but It is stated In the report that none of the different organizations conforms to United States Army organization. It is pointed out that this cannot be remedied until pending legislation is enacted. Need for New Armory. Under the head of "recommendations and remarks relative to the militia made by officers of the regular army" appears the following statement by Ma J. Lloyd M. Brett, 1st United States Cavalry, in regard to the District militia: "A suitable armory continues to be the crying need of the National Guard of the District of Columbia, A bill for such a structure is again before Congress and has the earnest support of the War Department. Congress has in many ways ex. pressed itself, unequivocally, as favoring the proper support by the federal government of an efficient organized militia. No troops have shown themselves more deserving of encouragement than those in the District of Columbia, and it is believed that Congress will come to their relief as soon as it realizes that they have no lit place in which to do the military work necessary to qualify them for their couniry's service. "It is recommended that infantry companies of the regular army camp with the infantry regiments of the National Guard; that both the officers and non-conrmissioned officers of such companies be utilized as instructors and examplars of army methods. The non-commissioned officers will get closer to the guardsmen than the commissioned officers, and will I reach .them the little things of camp life' that means so much In the way of comfort. and can offer many suggestions about ' messing, arrangements of the tents, and the importance of a prompt response to duty calls, the militiaman's weak point.

"The need of such Instruction and association to cavalry and field artillery is augmented threefold by the horse, his use, equipments and care. Mounted National Ouard troops. In my opinion, can be made efficient only by association with and instruction from like units of the service. "It is believed that detachments of the regular army cannot be more profitably employed In times of peace than instructing the National Guard forces in camp, and, when possible, at home stations. The two forces will mutually benefit by the association. The regular, with the eyes of the young volunteer upon him as the finished product of the standing army, will strive to reach the highest standard of efficiency, gaining increased confidence in his abilities as his responsibilities increase. The militiaman will gain an understanding of discipline and the correct methods in his military work. Maneuvers on a large scale are not favored at this time. Tbe guardsman is in the primary stage of his development, and it will take several years of careful training along well-thought-out and progressive lines before he can contemplate anything more advanced than the simplest problems In attack and defense." First Field Battery. Regarding the 1st Battery of Field Artillery. the expert states that it is provided with four breech-loading rifles 3.2-inch caliber, model 1807; four carriages with limbers; four caissons with limbers and one wagon forge and battery, all of which are described as "serviceable." On the subject of p.ersonnel It is stated: "Men are rugged and of very satisfactory physical appearance, but lacked military bearing. Character and reliability, good; seal, moderate; efficiency, fair. A number of skilled artisans ;.nd machinists." As to the battery armory, the report sa vs: "The armory accommodations are dis<-onraging. One coal atove on second floor is the only heating plant. The guna are stored on a cement floor. The battery should be given the entire lower floor. There are not even decent quarters for the men." The following statistics are given in regard to the small-arms practice of the District militia during the season of 1907: Average strength, present and absent, commissioned and enlisted, for the entire period of firing. 1.4S0; per cent of average strength qualified. 0O.O&; expert riflemen. 125: sharpshooters.

President's Message, Its Charges of Lies, and Denunciation of Pulitzer Amuses Congress. Repeated peals of laughter greeted the reading of the opening paragraph of the President's messsige to Congress on the Panama canal charges today. As the secretary read the statement that the charges were "false in every particular," Senator Bailey laughed outright as he was passing along the rear of the chamber to his seat. Other senators on both sides of the chamber joined with him. When the reader reached the statement that a statement in a newspaper which he mentioned would not be believed there was general merriment from both sides of the chamber. There was only a small number of senators present when the reading was begun. It was hurried through, the papers accompanying .the message not being read at all. The message elicited the greatest Interest in the House of Representatives. The members gave close attention during tne reading of the document. There was a ripple of laughter over the President's characterization of Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of tihe New l'ork World. The message, with its accompanying papers, was referred to committee.

Expected That Sir Montague Allan Will Re His Successor. Special Dispatch to The Star. AVONTRBAL, December 15.?Lord Strathcona. having passed his eighty-eighth birthday, apparently as hale and hearty as he was when chief factor of the Hudson Bay Company, something like a half century ago. will shortly resign his post as Canadian high commissioner in London. and it is expected that Sir Montagu? Allan, son of the late Sir Hugh Allan, will succeed him. Sir Montague Allan is looked upon as the head of the house of Allan in Canada, and such honors as are due the Allans, including a knighthood from the late queen and various decorations from representatives from foreign lands, have come his way. Although interested in the Allan- line. Sir Montague does not concern himself actively with the business, but his time is taken up to a considerable extent with the management of his late ? ' VVt V*. t<V IO lli^ V, |J 1C1 executor. As Canadian high commissioner in London Lord Strathcona succeeded Sir Charles Tupper, who resigned the office in 1866 to return to Canada, enter politics and go down with the conservative party before the liberals under Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Donald Alexander Smith, first Baron Strathcona, G. <C. M- O., was born in Scotland in 1820. He received his early education there, but while still young went to Canada- and entered the service of the Hudson Bay Company. He was the last resident governor of that corporation as a governing body. During the first Kiel rebellion in the Red river settlement In 1860 he was a special commissioner, and for his work at that time he received the thanks of the governor general In council. He was appointed a member of the first executive council of the Northwest Territory in 1870, and until 1806 he held a seat in the Manitoba legislature and the dominion house. In 1896 he was appointed high commissioner of Canada, with the rank of baron. Lord Strathcona's other interests have been varied. Among these it may be mentioned that he is a director of the 8t. Paul. Minneapolis and Manitoba railroad and of the Central Pacific, president of the Bank of Montreal, chancellor of McGill University, honorable LL.D. of Yale, Cambridge. Glasgow and Toronto universities and honorary commodore of the Royal St. Lawrence Yacht Club. 

TALKS GOLF WITH TRAVIS. Next President and Former Champion Have a Long Chat. NEW YORK, December 13.?The earnest attention which William H. Taft is paying and Intends to pay to the royal and ancient game of golf was evidenced today when one of the engagements to which he devoted an exceptional length of time was with Walter J. Travis, former amateur champion of the United States. Mr. Taft's talk with Mr. Travis was entirely devoted to golf. Mr. Taft will leave New York Thursday morning for Augusta. Ga.. where he will devote to golf the five weeks intervening before his departure for the Panama Canal Zone. Senator Beverldge of Indiana was among the prominent callers received by Mr. Taft today at his brother's home in West 48th street.

WILI.EMSTAD, December 15.?The Dutch battleship Jacob von Heemskerk * arrived in the harbor at 8 o'clock this J morning towing as a prize the Venezuelan coast guard vessel."23 de Mayo." Word of the capture >had already been E received here, and a great throng of peo- t pie lined the quays to witness the en- s trance of the Dutch battleship conducting * her capture within the harbor. The flag c of the Netherlands had been hoisted to ^ the peak of the captured Venezuelan ship, ' and astern of the Dutch flag floated the Venezuelan colors. Although the Vene- s zuelan flag was still shown, it was in minor contrast to the Dutch pennant fly- ? ing from mainmast and foremast both on e the warship and its prize. 1 The capture of the "23 de Mayo" was c effected on December 13 at a point a I little north of Cumana on the gulf of c Caraico. The battleship Jacob von Heems- ( kerk observed the "23 de Mayo" in the offing, took possession of her and sent a prize crew aboard. The Venezuelan crew which had been in charge of-the "23 de Mayo" was sent ashore in the small \ boats of the captured ship.

Indeed there is reason to believe that while the F official records may fail to show the ex- t istence of any formal agreement between t America and the .Netherlands, the gov- t ernment of the latter country is proceed- o ing, with the tacit consent of America, to o bring to an end the chaotic conditions a that have prevailed in an international f< sense in Venezuela for the past two years. 8 So long as the Dutch ships act strictly to within the lines of the Monroe doctrine, t as construed in the annual message to Congress of President Roosevelt last year; so long as no attempt is made to seize Venezuelan territory for permanent e occupation; so long as the Dutcli warship ? captains confine their activities to the h seizure of Venezuelan rhlps, the blockade of ports and the attempt to redress the 1 affront to Holland's honor, there prob- P ably will be no interference on the part fl of the United States government. r Of course, it is inconceivable that this a government has not already received some p assurances from Holland on this point, Ut but It is probably the case that these have ftp not been reduced to writings but are Rim- r ply matters of mutual understanding, 'e The experience of the allied powers Which operated against Venezuela several years g ago would seem to have Indicated to Hoi- t land the necessity of coming to some un- c derstandlng with the United States be- e fore proceeding to the point of actual a hostilities, which* after all, is the situ- t ation on the Venezuelan coast, notwithstanding diplomatic disclaimers. Logically the next step will be the declaration of a blockade, and of this due notice must be given by Holland to atl ? maritime nations In order to prevent the lodgment of claimr for unwarrantable injury Inflicted upow neutral commerce. Meanwhile the action of the Dutch cruls. n ers in seizing Venezuelan ships is calcu- $ lated to -have a depressing effect upon the T trade of Venezuela and to discourage prospective shipments of merchandise in * the present unsettled conditions. g

ABOUT TOTED CUBA 1 Gratifying Success of the Pro- E visional Government. RETURN OF TRANQUILLITY | Republic Freed From Its Burden of C Debt. BENEFICENT LAWS PASSED I rwo Large Projects Affecting the \ Sanitation of the Island Undertaken. Secretary Wright has made a report to .he President regarding the operations of v :he provisional government of Cuba. t rhat government, he savs. has nroceeded - satisfactorily during the past fiscal year, J ind has now reached the stage where its ermlnatlon is at hand. During the two j ind one-half years of its existence there j sas been a condition of peace and tran- t luillty in the Island of Cuba, Secretary ^ .Vright says, that is creditable in the lighest degree. All of the laws which the peace commis-lion of 1906 (Mr. William H. Taft and Assistant Secretary of State Bacon) leemed indispensable have been either t nacted or are now so far advanced in h >rocess of enactment that they will be- t :ome laws before the termination of the jj >resent government. In addition many g ther laws essential to the welfare of s ?uba have been enacted. a h Republic Found in Debt. d "While on the establishment of the pro- j. isional government in Cuba," says Sec- t etary Wright, "there was apparently 8 10.000.000 In the Cuban treasury, yet of * hat amount the Cuban congress had by t pecial laws appropriated approximately t 9.000,000 for various public purposes in ddition to the regular budget. There r irere numerous acknowledged and audited r lebts of the Cuban republic remaining un>aid, and a number of additional obliga- " ions incurred as a result of the insurrec- M ion and the resulting Increase of the ? ural guard. It was also manifest that J1 t would be necessary to pay large 11 .mounts because of damages due to the u nsurrection. An examination of the reasury within a month of the establish- P nent of the provisional government showd an estimated deficiency of $4,000,000 8 .fter meeting existing obligations. In naking this appraisal it was necessary to stimate the cost to Cuba of the insurectlon of 1906. Results have shown that s his estimate was something over $2,000,- s 00 less than what proved to be the actual n ost of this brief disturbance. Expenditures Held Tip. e "As a result of this condition of the o 'uban treasury it was necessary tempora- tl ily to suspend a number of the special cts of the Cuban congress appropriating ^ noney, in order to apply these sums to h quidate obligations of the class hereto- ti ore indicated.

Barton, who* fifteen days ag( pas convicted through his plea of guiltj o the indictments charging him with orgery, fraud, etc.. in the patent frauc rial, and who has been sentenced to the enltentiary, appeared on the stand todaj; n the continuation of the trial against leany and Everding and declared thai >oth defendants were conspirators with ilm in the attempt to so change the latent office records that a valuable atent could be obtained by changing inperative applications to more practicable >nes. His story showed the gradual yielding to emptation which at first appeared .to lave nothing criminal about #lt, through he stages to where actually the three uen met and a large sum of money was iaid over to him. .He corroborated the ;overnment's contention that a conpiracy among the three actually existed, Ithough Everding seemed to bear the runt of this particular part of the evience. Barton's appearance was unexpected, le followed the long dry cross-examinalon of the handwriting expert, J. F. Ihearman, and when his name was calld there was a sudden perking up all hrough the courtroom. Many of Bar on's old friends and associates were in he room and they craned forward eagery. Counsel on the side of the defense ustled papers and drew up chairs as if eady for a real battle. Barton wore a gray suit and a natty yoking collar, which on close inspection ^as seen to be very much soiled. He eeded a shave and a cold bath might ave brightened him up. He looked as f he had been up alt night or had beer nder great mental stress. In answer to he questions where he lived, Barton relied with alacrity: "Just now I'm in care of the United itates jail." Corroborates the Experts. His testimony as to the forged writings, lgnatures, insertions, etc., and the subtituted typewriting corroborated testiiony of the experts in every detail. He icked up sheet after sheet of the doctord flies and told how he had destroyed rlginals and substituted those now in he flies. That part, of course, had been lcluded generally in his confession of uilt, but it led up to his testimony in reard to meeting Heany and Everding and is relations with them, which the disriot attorney thinks amounts to a eonpiracv to defraud the jrovernment. He told how the original application ol [eany was inoperative and that a subtitution had to be made before patenl apers could be given out on the invenon; how he had visited Heany's labors>ry and had found that Heany was using le right method to obtain the proper reuits in his electric light invention, bul lat the lawyer. Everding, had. erred in ot sending a correct application for a atent. The district attorney showed drawings 1 the cases in question, and Barton said ley were placed in the flies after U>beame necessary to have them there in orer to issue a patent. They were drawlgs which witnesses have shown were lade at Everding*s directions. This linki Everding and Barton together. In a long-drawn-out talk Barton testied that Everding had come to hire fter the question of the original patent ad been discussed thoroughly by Heany, Everding and Barton, and had been inarmed that the application was inoperaive. It was then that Barton made the uggestion that the records - should be hanged. Barton said that following his istructions Everding had the necessary ubstitutes made for the specifications lready on file. Didn't Think It Criminal. "I did not know at the time it was a riminal offense." said Barton. "I thought might lose my position, but I spoke tc ne of the parties interested and was asured of a job if I -was found out at th? atent office." He said that Everding at one time had Iven him $130, which would be charged p to the new company to be formed wher ie Inventions began to be manufactured nd marketed. Similar amounts wer< iven to Barton at three other times, aejrding to his testimony. Up to this poinl larton had not included Heany, the inen tor. in his confession of conspiracy. Everding was the only man mentioned, ut Barton's testimony was of very am aging nature to the defense, and, if orrect, accuses Everding of everything ie government had put down in the inIctment. Just at recess time, however, larton said Heany had been present 'hen Everding gave him (Barton) $1,600 to bridge him over" until the new comany got under way.

'DOHA LICKER" IS MISSING I FILLED WITH CHOICE "MOONSHINE" FOR PRESIDENT. f Started From South Carolina for the White House?Sender Is Here and He's Worried. j The long-mooted question of who got r the Panama canal money, explained by (] President Roosevelt in a special message to Congress today. Isn't a marker to the question of what has become of one gallon of South Carolina "licker. sir." shipped to the White House by Maj. J Mieah Jenkins, collector of Internal revenue of that state. If the express com? pany has ?-er delivered it to the White 1 House there isn't a single official, from Secretary Loeb down, who will admit it. In these times of temperance activity it is considered wise not to give too much publicity to the sending and receiving of jugs or other utensils containing that ' which cheers. But this diplomacy doesn't satisfy the good people of South Caro- n 1 !ina. 1 \ "Beit to Be Had, Sir!" * That licker, sir. was the best moon- > t shine stuff manufactured in a partly a t prohibition state. Every prohibition b i county with half a taste for the juice t . of the corn knows the difference be- g j tween good and bad stuff. The state n . papers declared that there wasn't any , better stuff made in the mountains of ' the south, and the eyes of the whole r people have been directed this way. e i Thoughts of Christmas eggnog have > chased one another through the minds t i of the people of Calhoun's state, and > there has been wonder whether the 1 i President would know just what to do u ! with the juice sent to him. There is a mystery about it all. Maj. n Jenkins was an officer of the Rough fi ! Riders, a major in that regiment. He e is an intimate friend of the President. c He sent the jug himself, getting a re- c ceipt from the express company. Since v then there is no further trace. Maj. Jenkins is not in Washington, having arone tn K?w York to the Rnusrh Rider 1 dinner to Gen. Wood. He is worried, ^ - and badly worried. :

[ The congress awarded the institution a " gold madal for this exhibit. 1 The board was Informed of the removal - of the Qreenough statute of Washington . from its long-accustomed position east of the Capitol to the Smithsonian Institution. The statue is now on the lawn south r 1 of tha west wing of the building, whence o I it will be removed into the building as t4 i soon as the necessary foundation can be .. I provided.
