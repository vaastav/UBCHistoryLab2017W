There was a brief - session of the state land board yesterday. They fixed 4 o'clock p. in. as the hour at which surveyors shall close their books of reri:try on the day prior to the ten days bt-l'oro the board meets to consider applications from land purchasers. The board, by resolution, required that interest on payments for land viirihnifrl 'irtual eutrlara chtill ll . due one year in advance. The board tacitly agreed that where a party has bought his quota of land under former laws ho will not be en titled to make further purcbascs un der the newly adopted resolutions of t.hn ItriMTrl THE NEW CAPITOL WORK. The question as to whether the cap itol syndicate can take possession of the lands set apart for the contract to build the stale capitol, hits been re ferred to the attorney-general for his opinion. On general principles it would seem that the contractors should have a quantum uiernit ior their work as it progresses, unless the contract provides to the contrary. Tho letter from Architect Myers, relative to the resignation of Superin tendent Clark, has been received, but is more of a personal than public mat ter of interest. Col.

Attorney General Templeton fur nishes Gov. Ireland the following im portant opinions as to the legality of "bridge bonds" issued by the counties. The object of Gov. Ireland's inquiry doubtless is with reference to the board of education investing school funds. Austin, Texas, Dec. 3. 1883. Ills Excellency John Ireland, Governor and President board o Education: Sib: I have the honor to acknowl edge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ult., calling for my opinion as to 111C t3fUlltJ Ui. tUQ UUQ (lUU tUC V(U1U" ity of negotiable bonds issued by cer tain counties for the purpose of rais ing f untls wherewith to build bridges and known as "bridga bonds." Ac companying your letter is ai argu ment, or an opinion, by II. II. Iler m;ui, Esq., in support of the validity of such bonds, citing quite a number of authorities, most of which I have examined with all due care. I have concluded from an examination of our constitutional and statutory pro visions, and from a careful considera tion of the authorities, that the com mlssioneis courts of the counties are without authority to issue such bonds having all the Incidents, elements and immunities of negotiable paper, pass ing from hand to hand with all in quiry into their consideration and the honesty and good faith of thoir issu ance cut off and precluded in the hands of purchasers for value as the 'case with such paper. ' Section 21, article 16, of the consti tution, quoted in Mr. Herman's argu ment, provides that "the legislature shall make provision for the laying out and working public roads, for the building of bridges, and for utilizing hnpfl- frirfpirnrpa Arm pnnvipr. lidinr tr all these purposes." If this section supplies authority to issue bridge bonds it is authority as much for issu ing bonds, both for laying out public roads and for working them. But I have never heard of its being claimed for it that it gave any color of authori ty for issuing bonds for the two last named purposes. Indeed the section itself seems to me, in phun terms, to deny the idea that it intended to con fer such power, for it says that the fines, forfeitures, and the county con vict labor are to be utilized for all these purposes; and, in fact, without " legislation it meant nothing, for it only imposed a duty on the legislature to make provision for building bridges, public wonks and laying out roads. I do not mean to say (for it does not enter this question) that it takes from the legislature the power to clothe county commissioners' courts with the authority to issue bonds for such a purpose; I only say that it does not per" se do it.- It is not un worthy some consideration that this' section is not found in that part of the constitution relating to the matters of taxation and revenue, where the taxation for the state, county and cities is to some, extent provided for and regulated. It is attempted to derive the author ity to create such debts and issue such obligations with their consideration, and whether or not they were issued in corruption, peculation and fraud and for which the counties may have received nothing, sacredly beyond question, after having passed into the hands of bona tide purchasers for valued; "from article 4431, revised statutes, conferring on the county commissioners courts full power "to cause all necessary bridges to be built and kept in repair," and" "to make ap propriations of the money of the county therefor;" and from article 4133, providing that when bonds have been ls3ued or may thereafter be issued for the purpose of building bridges, it shall be lawful for the com missioners courts of the county or counties interested to assess and col lect tolls on said bridges sufficient to pay the interest and principal on the bonds so issued. Article 4 !3i wa3 taken by the codi ficrs from stction 4, chapter 55, laws of 1870, the same being "an act to o , ganize commissioners courts and to deline their jurisdiction and duties and to provide for vacancies therein." , The rest of this section, but little change is found in article 1514 of the Itevised Statutes, relating to the powers and duties of the comiuisson- ers court, where among other things. ic is autnorizeu to "establish lemes, lay out and '.'establish roads, provide , and repair court houses and jails, pro vide for the support of paupers and such idiots and lunatics as cannot be admitted to tho asvlum," and to "pro vide for the burial f paupers." Thi3 collocation and mere change of ar rangement was not intended to oper ate as a new enactment, or to change the meaning of these provisions of the said chapter E3 (final title 11. S., section 19). having for its purpose the organization, etc., of the commis sioners' court; and if then the article (1131) is authority to put in circula tion these bonds for the building of bridges, article 1514 the remainder of - the original section will be equal au thority to issue specific bonds tor all the purposes (specified therein- At any rate I confess to an inability to work out tho authority for one of these descriptions of bonds without at the same time working out like power to put in circulation bonds for the others. , . ' It is not believed that anyone coull claim for the court any such power. But tho article (4431) provides that these bridges are to tie buiit and kept in repair by appropriations from line county treasury, this of itself pointing to the source whence tho money is to come which may be needed to execute the power conferred by it. Then, taken in connection with acts 4430 32 '33 and '34 revised statutes, itreems to clearly show that it was not intended to say that negotiable bonds could be issued for sucn a purpose, tor it ap pears that bridges are to be built by the labor of the people in the different road precincts where situated, subject to road duty, and by appropriations of money from the county treasury. 1 will only remark on act 4Ua, that if such bonds have been issued under any valid law of the state, it has ref erence to them, and should any such bonds be hereafter issued, it win also have reference to them. It is not usual for the legislature to leave such extraordinary authority to far-fetched mlluences. It has not done so in tne matter of cities bonding themselves (acts 420, 421, 422, revised statutes), and it would hardly be less watchful of the welfare of the counties. It seems to have deemed it neces sary to pass an act speciflcially author izing the emission of bonds for the erection of the most important and indispensable of all public buildings the court house an I it saw proper to prescribe the maximum rate of in terest and time the bonds should run (chap. 9, session laws of 1881, page 5.) J5ut if these bonds can be issued there is no such limitation on the exercise of the power that I have been able to find. If, as Chief Justice Willie says, in Brown vs. Graham, 58 Tex., 256, the power to levy a tax must be plainly and unmistakably conferred by the the commissioners' court, "either by exriress words or bv necess.irv impli cation," is it not at least equally nec essary to look for as definite authority "for all our limited territorial boards charged with certain objects of neces- sary local administration to become the fountains of commercial issues, capaple of Moating about in the finan cial whirlpools of our large cities," which may, indeed, most necessitate the levying and collection of a tax for their payment for such period of time as the court may see proper to allow the bonds to run. The supremo court of the United States, in discussing just such a ques tion in the case or. I'onee J ury vs. urit ton, 15 Wallace, pp. 571-2, say: "It seem3 to us to be a power" (to issue commercial paper) "quite distinct from that of incurring indebtedness for im provements actually authorized and undertaken.the justness and vality of which may always be inquired into. It is a power winch ought not to be implied from the mere authority to make such improvements. It is one thing for county or parish trustees to have the power to incur obligations for work actually done in behalf of the county or parish, and to give proper vouchers therefor, and a totally different thing to have the power of issuing unimpeachable paper obliga tions which may be mult iplied to an indefinate extent. If it be once con ceeded that the trustees or other local representatives of townships, counties and parishes have the implied power j to issue coupon bonds, payable at a future day, which may be valid and binding obligations in the hands of innocent purchasers, there will be no end to the frauds that will be perpetrated." (p. 571-2). Tho court conclued (and it is well known the length to which that court his gone in sustaining the au thority to issue such paper,) that the duty of making certain specified im- Erovements and of collecting money y taxation to defray expanses there of did not imply the authority to issue negotiable paper to raise the funds to pay for the improvements. The case seems to be directly in point, and is well worthy of a careful reading by county oflicers attempting to exercise such power. It is not necessary to consider whether or not counties may issue certificates or vouchers evidencing their indebtedness for such service, leaving it open always to the counties to inquire into their consideration and validity in any hands into which they may come. If that can be done, it does not follow that negotiable bonds discharged of all defences can also be issued. I have the honor to be Very respectfully J ohn I). Templeton, Attorney General. Col. A. L. Campbell, Walterboro, S., C, says: "A member of my family used Brown's Iron Bitters with good results eod&w Got Caught. Our readers will remember that some time ago one William Shelley was arrested for horsa stealing, on a warrant issued by Justice von Rosen berg. One Alf Swank was the princi pal witness against him, and it was expected that his evidence would send Shelley into the service of the state for a number of years. He told the justice of the peace a wonderful tale of what he knew in regard to Mr. Shelley, and his peculiar ideas of the rights of possession of personal prop erty, particularly that kind of property the horse. It was upon the prospects of his telling his blood-curdling tale in court that Shelley was put under arrest. A day was fixed for trial ana Mr. Shelley was held for examina tion. At this interval facts came to light that seemed to indicate that Mr. Swank might be mistaken and per haps he was in error as to the identi ty of the man who had stolen the equines instead of its being Shelley it probably might prove to be. a man by the euphonious name of Swank. Of course any man is liable to make a little mistake like that. It seems that Mr. Shelley himself doubted the identity of his man somewhat and when a friend of his informed him that the justice had his suspicions on the subject of the identification of the horse thief his extreme love of justice prompted him to migrate. He had been subpoenaed to appear and testify at the prelimi nary trial of Shelley, and to disobey would subject him to a punishment for contempt of court; but when a man, from a sence of duty, makes up his mind to migrate he cann-t pay much attention to a trifle like incurring the contempt of a court. Mr. Swank thought the matter all over and he came to the humane conclusion that if he had made a mistake as to the identifi cation of Mr. fchelley, in justice to Mr. Shelly he ought to visit some friends who very much desired to see him on the day set for the prelimina ry trial; and the more he thought the matter over the more he became con vinced that it was his duty to migrate. He migrated. ' ; The day for the examination of Shelley came. and with it came not Mr. Swank. It came - out more fully at that examination that it realy was a case of mistaken identity and that the absent witness had actually mis taken Shelley for a man by the name of Swank, against whom there were grave grounds to suspect he had mis taken a neighbor's horses for his own. Shelley was discharged as a matter of course, and here the matter dropped. bwanK alter ne nad visited his mends and waited, as he thought, a sufficient length.of time for the matter to cool concluded he would pay a visit to Austin and ascertain what had been the fate of the unfortunate man who had been the victim of his careless ness. He walked into Von Rosen berg's office yesterday and inquired what had become of the case against Shelley. The justice gave him the desired information and Swank was about to depart, happy, when the strangest part of the remarkable epi sode occurred. Justice Von Rosen berg thought he discovered a striking resemblsnce between the real horse thief and the man before him, and so he ordered Mr. Swank un der arrest, and the man who had come out of curiosity went hence in the custody of an under sheriff to the county jaii. He was greatly surprised at the action of the justice of the peace, and stoutly protested that he was not the man wanted. ; but he is the man, or it is another case of mis taken identity. Many persons wiil take medicine until prostrated on a bed of sickness. This is folly. Nature always calls for assistance when needed to throw off impurities.. With our habits of life, it is necessary to render this help, riickly Ash Bitters will not force na ture, but acts mildly and renders the assistance require!. Try them. 

CITY MATTE KS IX BRIEF. Another span of the bridge almost finished. Tho total vote cast in the city Mon day was 1981. The case of C. D. Johns vs. the city wllL without doubt, be carried to the supreme court, we learned yesterday. The president s message will be found in full in to-day's issue. It is a lengthy document, but will be found to be interesting reading. Rev. Dr. Smoot, of this city, left yesterday for Georgetown to attend the funeral of Rev. Hilary Mosely, pastor of the Presbyterian church,, of that place. We are in receipt of an invitation to attend a grand ball and enjoy re freshments to be given by the young men of .Elgin, In Odd t enows nan, Wednesday evening, December 12, 1883. Rust & Denkins vs. Houston & Tex as Central railroad, a suit on implied contract growing out of a shipment of cotton was tried before a jury in the district court yesterday. Verdict, $14.45. "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown is seen in all its solemn lorce in the countenances of the respective city oflicers who are looking to the new city council for a continuance of their tenure of office. At the game of foot ball, played vesterdav between the University boys and the Bickler school boys, the hLtter trot awav with the silk-hat fresh-men lively. So say the Bickler boys who reported to The States man office. Now that we have a new council it is to be hoped that something liberal will bo done in the way of fixing the streets of the city. The new board can cover themselves with immortal glory by acting promptly in this mat ter. Let there be no delay. The mayor celebrated his re-election by taxing Geo. Malone five dollars for an election drunk. Peter Erza five dollars for another of the same species, James "Alexander five dollars for dis turbing the peace and Ed. Montgom ery 25 for carrying a pistol. The totals vote on the school tax is 826, of which 597 , are for and 229 against the tax, giving a majority of 308. The tax in order to carry had to receive two-thirds of the votes cast, which would be 550. so it has carried and has 57 votes more th:in the law requires. If the county purchase the new bridge, as it is said it certainly will, and a lino of street cars is extended to the other side of the river, quite a number of prominent citizens indicate their intention of building magnifi cent residences on the showy bluffs across the river. Mr. Chas. McXeal, the telegraph operator who took the president's message for this paper yesterday, de serves a special compliment. Every word was fully reported and written in a bold, legible hand. It was the most creditable piece of telegraphic reporting that has come under our no tice for a long while. In justice to Mr. Heidbrink it should be stated that when about forty votes had been cast in the Ninth ward Mon day, he withdrew his name and pub lished a circular requesting all his friends to vote for one of the other candidates. This accounts for the smallness of the vote he received. Mr. R. M. Johnston, Austin man ager of the Houston Daily Post, has been solicited to become a candidate for clerk of council. It is not known whether he will accept the position or not. He would undoubtedly make a good clerk if appointed. It is under stood that T. L. Purnell is also a can didate for the appointment. In the county court yesterday, Ben Williams said he was guilty of taking a small amount of another man's pro perty and using it as his own, for which Judge Fullmore fined him 50. Joe Hawkins and John Anderson committed the same error, for which oversight the judge rewarded them by a month's board at the county's ex pense. It is reported that the gobblers lost by Major Joe, were taken by Budd Driskill and L. M. Crooker while the major was absent looking after elec tion matters. One thing is certain, the major lost his gobblers, and these men when asked failed to deny that they had been gobbling while the major was off attending to his patri otic duties. The Ladies' Reading Room Sewing society will meet to-morrow (Thurs day) evening at 2 o'clock in the parlor of the Avenue Hotel, to prepare pretty and useful article for the reading room fair. Those who cannot come at that hour will please be welcomed later, and it is hoped that without further invitation the room may be filled. The enterprising ladies in charge of the entertainment at the opera house the night of the 8th December, for the benefit of the Women's exchange as sure us that they are preparing some novel and interesting features for the occasion, in addition to the fine mu sical programme which will be pre sented. Due announcement will be made in The Statesman. From the report of the city sexton, found elsewhere, it wm oe noticed that during the month of November there were thirty-six deaths in thi3 city, of which twenty-two were males and fourteen females. Fourteen or almost half were under five years of age and three bet wen live and twenty, showing a large mortality among the little folks. Two were from the coun ty, outside the city, and two were brought from elsewhere, to be interred in Austin, making the actual total in the city thirty-two. A very interesting case was called last night in the district court and is now on trial, entitled J ane urm and husband vs. the Houston & Texas Central railroad. It is a cuo for per sonal injuries for which tli 3 plaintiff, Jane Bnn, claims $20,,uO damages, Walton & Hill, of this city, and Col. Harrison, of Houston, are the counsel for the plaintiffs, and Judge Uolu- thwaite, of Houston, the well known railroad attorney, is the advocate for the defendant corporation. The case will be hotly contested. The council did not meet last night and it is said will not until Saturday. There are several reasons why the newly-elected gentlemen postponed their inaugural. In the first place it will require ten more desks to accom- date the extra members and they could not be provided before that time; again they wished to have a lit tle time in which to allow the candi dates for appointment to prepare their minds as to the proper choice to be made; and last but not least, they deemed it prudent to take a little respite after the fatigue, consequent upon an aldermanic election. The entertainment at Turner nail last nicht passed off auite creditably. The instrumental solo by Miss Julia Palm was well received; the song by Mr. G. P. Warner won applause; the performance by Mrs. M. Townsend was skillful; the Magnetic Waltz song by .Miss tsimpson w:is highly delight ful; Miss Odom's instrumental solo was excellent; Miss Nita Smith's "Moonlight, Sweet Moonlight" was well rendered: and the quartettes bv Misses Simpson and Preston and Messrs. Edwards and Warner good. The other features or the entertain ment were all well received. Justice Von Rosenberg yesterday handed his resignation to the com missioners' court. He is a candidate for city recorder before the new council, and as he cannot hold both offices he has resigned the one he now holds. This would seem to indicate mat J usuce v on ltosetaoerg has re viewed the troops and knows just now the battle is to end so tar as that office is Involved; else he would not surrender his present office. Well, he has made a good justice and will, no doubt, tax the offenders of the city ordinances equally satisfactorily if he is to ce recorder. Jim Organ and a woman of color, Fannie Whipple, had a lively time yesterday. Jim worked hard all day Monday and got his patriotic nature so wrought up that he took a stick and began to pound the dark skinned Fannie ovr the head .and shoulders with the aforesiaid club, inflicting several severe wounds upon her neck and breast. Miss Whipple did not fancy being whipped .with that sort of stick, nor did she like the kind of music that sort of Organ gave her, so she forthwith went to the fat justice and tiled a criminal charge against Jim Organ aforesaid. Justice Tege fcpf will tune him up lively this morn ing. The old and well known stationery house of B. J. Kopperl, on Congress avenue, failed last evening. An as signment wa3 made to A. P. AVool d ridge for the benefit of the creditors cT the house about six o'clock last night. Mr. Wooldridge, the assignee, was seen by a Statesman represen tative and he stated the assets to be about 827,000 and the liabilities to be 23,500. Mr. Kopperl has turned over ail of his property, and the assignment ij said to be thoroughly an honest one. For some time it has been rumored the condition of the house vas getting shaky, and not a few have been looking for the crash; still the failure will take the city generally by surprise. The assignee stated that ail of his creditors dealt very kindly towards the unfortunate merchant and he is of the opinion that by a judicions handling of the assets he would be able to settle with the credi tors so as to save something. It de pends, of course, upon ihe liberality of the creditors. CHUliCII 

NOTES. The Presbyterian church, of which Rev. R. K. Smoot is pastor, is one of the most progressive in the city. The building itself is of good size, wen located and comf rtably arranged. There have been spent upon it, in construction and improvements, over 81(5,000. The register shows about 240 members, who more or less con tribute to the support of the church, paving last year S666i.il as the cur rent expenses, including pastor's sal ary and required payment on the church debt. Tne debt has been so reduced as to make its liquidation a much easier matter in the future. All this speaks well for a membership composed largely of persons of moder ate means. The church was established here in 1850 by Rev. William M. Baker. The war produced some differences in the following of the pastor, who at first sided with the South, but owing to the action or the Northern presbytery many adopted the Northern idea and were alienated trom the hock, out Mr, Baker himself changing with them they returned to his congregation. Then those following the bouthern branch of the church took offense at the prayer which was adopted praying for the president of tha united states. The result was that only about a dozen of the old members remained on the roil or tne Southern adherents when the war closed. From this nucleus has grown tho present congregation of the Southern, as distinguished from the Northern Presbvteeian Church, of which Dr. Smoot and Dr. Wright are the respective pastors. The officers of Dr. Smoot's church are A. H. Cook, R. E. Grant and J. II. Hutehins, elders; B. S. Pillow. Dr. Burt, Judge Fullmore, M. Mclnnis, J. M. Brown,L. Shackelford and Clark Red. deacons: superintendent ot Sun day school, John M. Brown. When Dr. Smoot bec ame the pastor in ii there were 72 members and a debt of about $10,000 which is now reduced to about 1200, while the membership has increased as stated to 210. The Sunday school has an average attend ance tt about 100 out or leu on tne roil, who are faithfully instructed by a dozen teachers. The church choir is a good one, composed of the follow ing ladies and gentlemen: C. M. Sta ples, leader; Miss Lillie Staples, or ganist, and the Messrs. Kreisle, and Misses Kosa staples and sister, miss Shipman, Miss Lillie Erwin and Miss Sophia Kreisle, singers. At one end of the church is to be seen a portrait of Dr. T. D. Manning, a former superintendent of the Sun day school, who fell a martyr to the yellow fever at nolly Springs, Miss., where he went to assist and died in humanity's work. Mrs. G. W. Erwin i3 president, and Mrs. J. W. Robertson treasurer, of the Ladies' Aid Society which has con tributed largely by its efforts in meet ing the current expenses of the churclL Among those who attend the church are Gov. Ireland, Judge Walker, Pro fessors . Dabny and Hamphries. and other prominent persons. Prof. Gould is a member of the church. Dr. Smoot, after reading snd com menting in his usual off hand and orig inal manner upon the eighth chapter of Romans, adopted the thirty-fourth verse as the text of his discourse Sun day. His sermon, preached entirely without notes or manuscript, was a learned and eloquent presentation of the tenets of the church and especial ly the doctrines which are largely based on this chapter. As a pulpit orator Dr. Smoot is regarded by many as equal, if not superior to any in this city, aud perhaps in the state. Those who hear him never fail to be edified and delighted with his ministrations. Alluding to tho querry of the text, "Who i3 he that condemneth?" he likened the censorious to the culprit who, despite his consciousness of guilt, boldly declares to the jury "I am not guilty," and seeks by the very finesse of his audacity to impress them with the idea that he is inno cent. The man who slanders the church and traduces God s people was no worse han the one who circulates slander. The Scriptures are terrible in their denunciation of slander and falsehood. When a man feels that he has been acquitted of guilt in the eyes of God, his spirit may well be stirred up at the condemnation of men, for he feels that he has been pur chased at a great price by the death of Christ. God's intentions were misunder stood and men misinterpreted his scriptures, who sneered at his scheme of redemption. This part of his ser mon was elaborated by Dr. Smoot in the strongest terms. When he spoke to his people and told them of his plan of salvation he wantrd it to stand be yond the possibility of failure. This was good sense and good Presbyte rianism. "If," said he, "I believed that there was any probability of the children of God being lost UDder the scheme of God's sedemption, I should prefer some surer plan for our salva tion. If Christ lives, as tho Bible saith he ever does, to make interces sion for us, then we live in Christ. If Christ lives, his people will live, and this was the latitude and longitude of religion that Christ will save every sinner who comes to God by him, be cause he ever liveth to make interces sion for us. It is My will, He saith, that my people be with me. Their will is one. God and Christ cannot be divided." This was the basis of the argument which Dr. Smoot elaborated from his teXt. r All of Oue Mind. Dr. It. "Wilson Carr, of Baltimore, says "he has used llosadalis in cases of scrofula and other diseases. Dr. T. C. Fugh, of Baltimore, re commends Rosadalis to all persons suffering with diseased blood, saying it is superior to any other preparation. Rev. Dabney Bail, of the Baltimore M. E. Conference, says he has been so much benefited by the use of Rosa dalis that he cheerfully recommends it to all his friends and acquaintances. eod&w AdTlee to Mothers. Mra.
