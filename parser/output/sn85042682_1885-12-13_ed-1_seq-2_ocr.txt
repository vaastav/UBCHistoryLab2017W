" Millions for defence: not one cent for subsidies," Is the motto ot this Actrain!stra Hon. After all there la nothing very strange about Admiral I'orler's reminiscences. " Truth Is "elrnnger than Fiction." Senator Logan is beating the bush for a bird of larger size than n President pro tern. of the Senate, with the Hoar bill allaoh ment. The Republican fathers hare not killed the failed calf to celebrate the return of the wandering Mugwumps Ihey couldn't catch the calf. John Sherman is considerably nearer the nomination for the Presidency, but he is J list as far oil a3 ever from an election to that office. Logan leading in theSenatewith Klmumls and Hoar following brings to mind the com posite country team, with a Jack lu front and two horses at the wheel. When the Senate begins the process of sifting the President's appointments it will And but very few that will fail to pass through the finest mesh. Republican legislation In behalf of the ehip-bullding interests has been so success ful that we point with pride to the fact that one Bingle merchant vessel is now in course of construction In the United States. As the President has thoughtfully advised Congress of all the other wants of the ser vice, would It not be the generous thing to provide for his comfort and convenience a more suitable, healthy, and commodious Ks ecullve Mansion ? It is true it might not be possible to complete it during his present term, but it could be gotten ready for his occupancy during his next term. In face of the fact that the United States imports more gold than it exports, to say nothing of the amount of gold mined in the country, while there is a steady outflow of gold from the single standard countries, it is absnrd to say that the coinage of silver will drive gold out of the country. It has not done so in the past and will not do so In the future. England, a monometalllst country, is suffering from the drainage of gold, while the United States from 1SE0 to 1SS5 acquired $183,000,000, of gold from abroad in excess of its exports. President Cleveland's first annual message to Congress confirms the confidence of the country In his good judgment, administra tive ability, purity of motive, and exalted patriotism. It exhibits a thorough knowl edge of the traditions of our Government, and a painstaking acquaintance with our national wants and condition. While It is a business message of high order, it Is more than a mere resume of the affairs of the country, for it riBes above th- level of or dinary discussion, and breathes an exalted patriotism in every part. Concerning our foreign relations the message is full of de tails, and underlying all these dry state ments of facts is shown a promptness to de fend the national dignity and honor, and protect American citizens In all their rlghtB, In his treatment of the currenoy and tariff questions there will be many of his party faith who will not follow his suggestions, but all will admit the ability with which these subjects are handled, and the patriotic; purpose which underlies his belief. Upon the question of civil service reform the President speaks in no muffled tones. lie depicts the evils of tho spoils system, and the demoralization growing out of it, in bold and convincing language, and shows a deter mination to adhere to his pledges for pure government. Under his administration the laws are to be obeyed, and official dishonesty to be visited with prompt punishment, while our material prosperity is to be advanced and our credit maintained. To the affalrB of the District of Columbia he has given careful attention, and his recommendations for improvements in the National Capital command our grateful acknowledgment. No one can read the message without being Im pressed with Its broad and virile patriotlcu, and honest endeavor to advance the interests of the masseB, while doing no injustice to the interests of capital. "Nothing is clearer," says the New Voik Pott, "than that the framers of the Constitu "lion meant that the person who succeeded "the President in case of his death or disa bility should be of the same party as he," Nothing Is clearer than that the framers of the Constitution had no such idea in view. In the first place, under the Constitution is framed by our fathers, the person receiving the highest number of votes was to be Presi dent, and the one receiving the next highest to be Vice President. This negatives emphatically the Hit's opinion. When the Constitution was altered to provide for the election of Presi dent and Vice President by separate ballot ings, the change was made to prevent the evil of a tie in the Electoral College, which occurred when Jefferson and Hurr received the same number of votes. It is common sense that the Presidential succeislon in the event of accident should durolvu upou some one of the same party as thedeceased or dis abled incumbent, but the framers of the Constitution left that and many other con tingencies to the discretion of Congress, or to such amendment of the organic law as ex perlence might dictate. While The Si-mut IIkiulu has alwavs been an advocate for economy lu the public expenditures a cardinal principle of the Democratic party ever since its incorporation in the first National Democratlo platform it has never agreed ltk those narrow mind ed persous who would cut down expenses to the injury of the public service, True econ. oiny does not consist in lopping off necessary expensei, nor in Btlntlog neoessary publlo works, but rather In appropriating sufficient for the publlo necessities, and seeing that the money to appropriated is neither griuaii dered nor stolen. There are to-called econo mists, who have made great publlo repula tions as "watch-dos of the Treasury," whose peculiar theories cm the subject have been well caricatured by Washington Irving, lu Diedrlch Knickerbocker's History of New York. William the Testy, the second Dutch Governor, is described as be'ng "so Intent "upon guarding the national pocket that he "suffered tho enemy to break its head-In "other words, whatever precaution for pnb "Ho safety he ndoptedi he was so Intent "upon tendering it cheap, that he Invariably "rendered It Ineffectual." " When the word ' eoouomy ' Is pronounced " in a national assembly," says tho venera ble Diedrlch Knickerbocker, " It lias an 1m "mediate effect In closing the hearts, be " clouding the Intellects, drawing the purse " sitings, and buttoning lliebreeches-pookets "of all phllosophlo legislators. It produces " a contraction of the retina, an obscurity of " the crystalline lens, a viscidity of the vlt "reousandan lnsplssallon ol the aqueous "humors, an Induration of the tunica sclero tica, and a convexity of the cornea: Inso " much that the organ of vision loses Its "strength and perspicuity, and tho unfortu nate patient becamea myopes, or, In plain "English, purblind; perceiving only the " amount oflmraeliate expense wlthoutbetDg "able lo look further, and regard It in connec "tion with tho ultimateobject to be effected. '" So that,' to quote the words of the elo "quent Burke, 'a briar at his nose Is of "'greater magnitude than an oak at five '"hundred yards distance.' Such are Us "instantaneous operations, and the results "are still more astonishing, Uy its maglo "influenceseventy-fonrs shrink Into Irlgales, " frigates Into sloops, and sloops Into gun "boalB." Congress has a delicate and difficult duly to perform lu steering between the Scylla of economy and the Chary bdls of extravagance. It should not be deterred from providing for national defense and general welfare by rea son of the vast amounts necessary to provide for both. Neither should it listen to thoso who would have It waste large sums lu schemes of doubtful utility, or of purely local advantage. For the first time in a quarter oi a century tho Democratlo parly has the responsibility on Its shoulders of administering the Uoverument. It Is pledged to economy, but not to parsimony. Where publlo works of a truly national character are required, It Is true economy to give what Is necessary, so that the end de sired may lie speedily and economically reached. When there is an Insufficiency of clerical force in any department to carry 011 Its business properly, the deficiency Bhould be supplied, while on the other hand useless offices should be done away with. But we want no more cutting down expanses on a general scale, without regard lo tho effect upon the service. The Secretary of the Navy in his annual report strikes the subject of the proper-education of our naval officers clearly in alro- callug special technical training for the offi cers wno In the futnre are to design and build our war vessels. After sneakine tf the difficulties Involved in the problem of dlslgnlng the complicated machinery of a modern ship, and the practice in England and France of fitting the engineer and con structor by training them .13 specialists in tueir respective professions, in order that the best result may be attained, he Bays: In broad contrast with hmh tho f,rn.it nnt.iini-.r, here Indicated, the onlv Rten wo hum tatn fnpm.n. years to meet the constantly changing exigencies of i avi,.e uoa ueeu 10 discontinue ine special edu cation of engineers.

They (the foreign powers) Imagine that Hihcepupwiinoncurancn or scientific human In dustry at the present tune is sufficient for one man, and that It Is necessary to educate him to It and to furnish adequate rewards. The present graduate has no special tech nical education, such a3 was clveu to the classes of cadet engineers or the students at such techuical Institutions as Cornell Uni versity, Stevens Institute, the Massachu setts Institute ot Technology, and others of nice ciiaracler. To re-establish a special course of trainlnrr for the encineers and rar. structors at the Naval Academy the act of August S, 16S2, should be changed so .13 to select from the cadets at the end of a two years' cjurse a sufficient number to fill the vacancies in the service, and educate those retained for the corps to which thev ar as. signed, giving tho cadets not retained for the service a certificate stating that they had completed the prescribed twoyears'oourseat the Academy. The total number of naval cadets would be the Bame, but tho numbsr in the higher cla3se3 would be small, and those in the third and fourth claise3 larger than now. Another advantage would be that an appointment would be made everv two years in cate a cadet was not retained in ineservleo, while now a member of Congress has but one appointment in six years. It would also save to the Government the differ ence between the pay of a cadet at the Naval Academy $500 per annum and the pay of the Bamo cadet at sea for two years at a yearly pay of $050, and In adiition the cost of bring ing these cadets home at the expiration of their two years' service for their cradualluir examination. It is to be hoped that Congress will do something that will change the pm ent course at the Naval Academy. Now a cadet who prepares himself for one branch of theservico finds himself assigned to another for which he has no taste or education. Mb-

Whllo believing thoroughly in tho policy of handing over lo tho Army refractory Indians for summary treatment, ho presents a tanglblo schcrao for tho gradual Improvement of tho tnoro civilized tribes, which will In the courso ot timet render them self-supporting in a greater degree than at present. To this end ho asks for Increased appropriations for the present, and tho establishment of a system which will gradually decreaso tho sum to bo annu ally appropriated by Congress. Under Mr. Atkins's administration of Its affairs tho management ot tho Indian Durcau will be honest and efficient, and free from thoso scandals which have rendered our deal ings with the Indians a reproach. m m Tiie President has strong views upon tho subject of courts-martial.

This Is harsh language, but deservedly so In regard to the sentences some times rendered by courts-martial. It should be borne In mind, however, that sentences of dismissal have been so frequently rendered null by the action of Congress In reinstating the parlies dismissed, that milder sentences nave, m point Of fact, often been more effectual la the way of punishment. The Army and Navy are ready for reform oa this subject, and it Is hoped that restoration to rank and emolu ments in tho case of officers dismissed for cause will hereafter be the exception rather than the rule. 01 Secketahv Whitney's proposed changes In the administration of the Navy Department are In the direction of slmDllclty and trne economy, and will doubtless receive favorable consideration by thought ful men In both parties. It may be regarded as settled that the people have determined that Iho United Mates shall hae a navy, approaching in efficiency that ot other great commercial nations. To effect th!3 we have to begin anew, for we have no navy, practically speaking, at present. The Secretary proposes to so reorganize the machinery of his office that he may be at all times informed of what Is required and of what is being done.

PACTS AIlOtT OFFICIAL HOt'RrUXfl. Flro times nsw In four years have al) the Execu tive Departments and ihe White Itoise been draped with mourning at the same time, while Individually scvctalot these buildings havo been In mourning oflener, becauso when an ex-member ot tho Cabinet dies only tho Department or Depattmenta over which he has presided arc hung with black, while when a member of tho Cabinet dies In office allot the Executive Departments go into monrnlng, as was the case when rostmaater General Howo died la 1SS3, and when Secretary rolictdledlnisst. nn Instances, togelhcr with tho mourning pnt on the buildings for rrcsldent Garfield In issl, and for ex President Grant and Vice President Hendricks this year, make flvo limes In four years. On account ot monrnlng having been bo frequently required for Ihe public buildings In the past four years, Col. Wilson, the Commissioner ot Public Buildings and Grounds, taj no n ininsing seriously or putting In his next advertisement for contracts one for monrnlng for the White House, If required at any time during Ihe year, because ho says when thcoccaslon for it comes It Is often difficult to get It and havo It mado and put np as promptly as Is deemed proper. Of course, loo, It could bo dono moro economically It let out by contract. It cost one thousand dollars when Ihe cdlrlco occupied by Iho Stale, War, and Navy De pattmenta was put in mourning for Gen. Grant. The Senate Chamber now has Its galleries as well as tho outside of Its doorways hung with black, and the chair ot the presiding officer Is. droned with black mourning crapo of excellent quality. No mourning has been Inside of tho Chamber before since tho death ot Vice President Wilson, as that Is an honor reserved solely for tho death ot thoSenalo's own presiding officer. There was no black Inside tho Senate Chamber when tho Capitol was put in mourning f..r President Ojrflcld, though thcro were black draperies all around the Inside ot tho Halt of lleprcscntatlves. By the way, Vico President Hendricks when presiding in the Senate preferred not to usotho chair which Is now in mourning, which Is the same Senator Edmunds occupied while President tiro tempore. Mr. Hendricks liked one ot the chairs In which tho Senators sit in tho Senate Chamber much belter than Iho ono ho found pro vided for the presiding officer. Tho last Is almost a reclining chair, tho back Is so much inclined, and has a head rest a round cushion ot dark ted morocco at the top. Tho cntlro chair Is upholstered In Ihe same material, and has a double cushion on tho seal. The chair looks as If mado for a gentle dozo. The House of Representatives now has mourning on the outside ot Iho main doorwayslcadlne into tho hall from the corridor, but there Is no black Inside Iho Chamber. When the deaths occurred ot the first two Vlco Presidents (Clinton and Gerry, who died In office) the two Houses of Congress adopted the samo resolutions as to mourning. On April 51, 1512, the day of vico President Clin ton's funeral, It was resolved, "That from an un feigned respect to tho lato George Clinton, vice rrcsldent of tho United States and President of the Senate, Iho chair ot tlto rrcsldent ot Iho Senate be shrouded with black during tho present session, and, as a further testimony of respect for Ihe memory of tho deceased, tho members ot tho Senate will go into mourning and wear a blackcrape round the left arm for thirty days." Then tho Senate adjourned. Tho day of Clinton's funeral tho House met at 9 A. M., and on motion ot Mr. Tallmvlge It was re solved unanlmoasly, " That from all unlelgttcd re spect to the lato George Clinton, Vlco rrcsldent of the United States, tho Speaker's chair be shrouded with black during the present session, and, as a fur ther testimony of respect for tho memory of the de ceased, tho members will go Into mourning and wear black crape on tho left arm for thirty days." Ot late years tho wearing ot crape on tho arm in honor of deceased officials seems to have been re stricted lo the officers of the Army and Navy, who are ordered to wear It on the left arm and on their sword-handles, orders being Issued from the Waf and Navy Departments to lhat effect. The order for tho Arrny to go Into mourning when Oen. Grant died fixed the period at six Inonths, while tho Navy wcro ordered lnlo mourning for thirty days. Now the official order lo the Navy Is for three months' mourning for the lato Vico Presi dent, while for the Army tt Is only thirty days, and tho latter period will expire before the six months' mourning for Gen. Grant Is over, which will not be nntiUannary 23, Whllo oil Christmas Dayltfrmllo thirty days since the Vlcri President died. Jor Mt or gfttt. 603 P
