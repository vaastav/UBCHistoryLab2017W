VOL IT. ■RESSIM, , THE SENATE AND HOUSE INDUSTRI OUSLY AT WORK. Humorous Speech by Senator Vest on Wo man Suffrage— Senator Vorhces Talks on the Silver Question— And Shows Up the Republican Financial Record — Large Number of Bills Introduced in the House —Both Branches Adjourned Till Mon day. Senate. Washington, Dec. 10.— The president pro tern was authorized to 1111 vacancies occasioned by the recent changes in committee member ships and other like vacancies previously ex isting. Bills were introduced and referred for the suppression and prevention of pneumonia in neat cattle; to authorize the erection of a statue to Chief Justice Marshal. By Camden. for a further appropriation to continue the improvement of the Tattle Kanawha river in West Virginia. House resolution for a special committee on the rights of women, was taken up. Vest, in opposition, said the senate now had forty one committees, with messengers and clerks, one-half of whom, without exaggeration.were literally without employment. He had been informed by the sergeant :it-arms that he must have, if the resolution is adopted, six addi tional messengers. The committees on ter ritories and privileges and elections, were open to inquiry, and had now before them a single. proposition on the subject. There was anoth er committee that would do ample justice to it, one to which he referred most respectfully, that on Revolutionary claims. If there was any revolntionarv claim in this country that should go to that committee it was that for woman suffrage (Laughter), for it would revo lutionize society, religion, and woman's proper position in the family circle as wife and mother, for she was. this and not a politician and voter. As the committee on revolutionary claims had hail before it but one bill in thirty years it would be able to give woman suffrages their undivided attention, and they would there lindat last one undivided haven of rest. That committee was, in par liamentary life, typical of that verse in Watts' hymn, There shall I bathe my soul In seas of heavenly rest, And not a wave of trouble roll Across my peaceful breast. That committee needed to-day, in a western phrase, some "stirring up," and what could stir up this most venerable and respectable in stitution more than a delegation of "strong minded," with short hair and shorter skirts, invading its dignified realm and demand ing attention while it illustrated female suffrage? (Renewed merriment.) Moreover, if these ladies could even succeed in obtaining in Providence, a good report from that committee it would end the question forever, because the public at large, himself included, in view of that ex hibition of power of female blandishment and female influence, would surrender at once, and female suffrage would become constitutional and loyal. Vest finally moved to refer the subject to that committee. Not agreed to. Ayes 21, nayes 3. . Senator Bayard moved to refer the resolu tion to the committee on judiciary. He re garded woman suffrage as presenting a ques tion which struck at the very roots of the present organization of society. It was a many sided one, and some of its aspects were not lilting for discussion in a public forum like the Eenate. The morning hour expiring, Senator Logau asked and obtained unanimous consent to say a word. He thought it but just that the lady citizens of the United States should have a committee specially charged to hear their views, which should be organized as favorably to those views as possible in order that such citizens may hays a hearing. Morrill asked unanimous consent to allow he resolution to be disposed of. Voorhees asked the regular order, namely, resolutions and the bill on presidential suc cession. This subject was accordingly taken up, but laid over after a statement by Jones, (Flu), who had the floor, that he would yield for a speech by Voorhees on another subject. The following assignments in the rearrange ment of committees consequent upon the re cent vacancies were announced: Windom is substituted for Edmunds as chairman of committee on foreign affairs, and takes the place of Aid rich on the same committee. He is also assigned to the committees on patents, and education and labor, to fill vacancies, and to the committee on transportation mutes to the seaboard, in place of Blair. Harrison succeeds Logan on Indian affairs and Sawyer on territories. Al drich takes the place of Hawley on District of Columbia. Sewell is assigned to the chair manship on enrolled bills, in place of Rollins; Sawyer to the select committee on census, in place of Cameron (Wis); Miller (New York) to committee on epidemic diseases, in place of Miller (Cal.); Hill (Col.) to the select committee on Nicarguan claims, in place of Howley; Davis to committee on civil service and retrenchment, in place of Hill (Col.); Sounders to the select committee on civil ser vice in place of Rollins; VanWyck to com mittee on pensions, to fill vacancy. Voorhees' resolution, referring to the finance committee parts of the president's message relating to the repeal of laws author izing silver coinage and the issue of silver certificates was taken up, and that senator addressd the senate. He referred to the financial dis tress of the country daring the five years prior to 1871, and the following act demone tizing silver, and said that while this distress was not due to that legislation the act was a patent factor on the general scheme for the extraction of money, and the consequent over throw of business prosperity. It was one of several kindred measures designed for the same end, and looking to the benefits of money lending usurers engaged in making money scarce and a dear rate of interest, making high wages low and times hard for all but bond and mortgage holders. The law of the Democratic cangress inlB7S, restoring silver circulation by means of cer tificates and coin, broke the nightmare spell of financial prostration and quickened the vi tality of every business enterprise. It gave positive assurance of the much needed grad ual increase of our circulating medium. Every body could then know how much was coming and at ' what rate, and could prepare for business accordingly. None of the vehement prognostications of cavil then made against United States stiver money had been verified. The capricious ex ercise by different secretaries of the treasury of a vast and dangerous power, contracting the currency and tightening the money mar ket at the instance of . national banks, who would have drawn out of circulation all kinds of money but their own in order that they might have the whole financial field and all its profits to themselves, together with the demonetization of silver, more than with the demonetization of silver, more than all other causes combined, what created and continued the pauic of 1873. The act of May 31, 1875, prohibited greenback money from being touched, and the treasury was thereby told to let the greenback circulation alone at the amount then outstanding. The answer to the cry that the greenback cause was a failure is given in the fact that the amounts of greenbacks in circulation in 1878 ami I$M, respectively, are exactly the same. That cause had achieved a great and important victory, for the greenback currency remained a steadfast, undeviating and honored one. Be sides the act securing greenbacks from further molestation, the subsequent steps, making it receivable for import duties, raised it to a par with gold, and there it has remained ever since. By these measures the currency has been reasonably expanded by the use of silver, and our entire circulation rendered stable and uniform in value, and to this was due the business prosperity of the conntry. It had been accomplished against the avowed hostility apd active energy of the Republican administration. Under the act or February 28, 1575, about $92,000,000 of legal tender silver money had been coined, and silver certificates issued to the amount of $66,663,800, based dollar for dol lar on that amount of coin now in the treas ury and pledged for their redemption. These certificates are in the pockets of the people, performing all the offices of money in daily business. Voorhees characterized the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury for a repeal of the authority for silver certificates and. for their early retirement, as a wanton and to his mind criminal assault upon the financial sta bility and business prosperity of the whole country. It was deliberately proposed to re tire more than sixty-six millions of money and destroy it, and the consequences of this could be imagined. The base proposition to contract and disturb the currency at this time would create disorder and panic. But congress is wiser than the executive department, and will pay no heed to this recommendation. In ask ing authority over silver coinage and the dis cretion to coin much or little, or none at all, the secretary's obvious object is to drive silver entirely out of circulation. The secretary complains that sixty-six mil lions of coin are in the vaults, and will not circulate, although great efforts are made to this end, and he also makes the statement that sixty-six millions of paper money^ based on this very coin is in circulation in every state in the Union. The secretary's report shows 6ilv«r circulation in round numbers of one hundred millions, sixty-six millions in certi ficates and thirty-four millions in coin. What, then, can be thought of his candor and intelligence in trying to leave the impression that silver money is a drug and failure, and that the people don't want it? This assault on one hundred millions of cur rency, on a specie basis, will be met by the country and its authors and sternly rebuked. The source of inspiration for it is apparently the secretary, who is the mouthpiece of the banks, and to quiet fear in the public mind of distraction by financial contraction, he says in his report: "There need be no apprehension of a too limited paper circulation. The na tional bonds are ready to issue their nots in such quantity as the laws of trade demand, and as security therefor the government will hold an equivalent in its own bonds." And he ( Vorhees) might say, in innocent compla cency, the entire control of the supply of cir culation of currency is handed over, in a few words, in the care of moneyed corporations whose interests and mercies are cruelty and multiplied usuries. The country is to depend on the generosity of the banks for its supply of money. The men least qualified by knowledge, usefulness or breadth of views to pass upon the wants of labor and of active business are the average national bankers. .Banks desire to destroy silver and greenbacks so that their fabulous profits may be extended over the entire cur rency of the country. Au average of not less than $17,000,000 a year is preserved by banks as interest on government bonds pledged for cir culation.and for eighteen years this aggregated over $300,000,000, which the people have had to pay for the blessings of bank money. Add to this the profits of banks on the circulation and deposits; and they have received from the pockets of the people since their creation enough gains to pay off at least two-thirds of the national debt; and all simply for our priv elige of receiving through their hands a little more than one-half of our currency, of no bet ter quality than other currencies, for whose circulation there was no tax. Was this such a showing as would induce congress to abandon the whole fiaancial ques tion to banks? Why will they not learn wis dom and forebear their greedy and repulsive demands? We have heard here and elsewhere many earnest admonitions agninst financial legislation? Who have been the agitators? Those who make those avaricious and arro gant demands at each session of congress "aro those who stand here to resist encroachmeat and oppression upon the rights and labor of the people? Voorhees charged that every financial agita tion from March, 1879, changing the contract under which the bonds were to be paid to the present, had been forced upon congress by the insatiate and relentless demands of banks and owners of bonds for unrighteous priveleges and powers. These powers people were weary of, and alarmed at their persistent agitation of the business of the country to promote their selfish ends, and if they persisted he knew it was only a question of time when the people would turn and render them powerless. He would commend thu history of the downfall of the United States bank half a century ago to the presidents of banks and their official friends in high places. He then quoted from Phila delphia papers of that day descriptive of the popular indignation attending the clo&ing of that institution. The resolution was agreed to. The resolution of Jones, calling for infor mation relating to the construction of the Florida ship canal was passed. On motion of Garland, the bill legalizing the election of the legislature of New Mexico, December 2, 1580, was pasted. Adjourned until Monday. House. Washington, Dec. 10. — The speaker an nounced the following special committee on expenses attending the illness and burial of President Garfield: Taylor, Pound, Cox (N. V.), Joyce, Lefevre, Belfonl, Blackburn, Paeje, Spuyer, O'Neill and Shelley. Robinson (N. V.) rose to a question of privil ege. He stated he had a resolution he desired to oiler. During the recess of congress an officer of this government connected with the state department had usurped the privileges of the house. The speaker: "The gentlemen have already disclosed their desire to proceed to business." Robinson— "This question involves the priv ileges of the house." The Speaker— "lt is not a matter relating to a member of the house." Robinson— "lt relates to the whole house. It is an usurpation by a department of this government. It involves the imprisonment of our citizens abroad. We can get nothing into this congress. The rights of our citizens can not be heard. (Loud criea of "order.") I will not press it now, but yon will hear from me again." The call of states was then continued at the point where left unfinished Tuesdjy last.

THE GUITEAU TRIAL. AVALANCHE OF DAMAGING TESTI MONY INTRODUCED YESTERDAY. Guiteau'* Divorced Wife on the Witness Stand— Caused a < Stampede of Lady Spectators -She Testifies to Quit eau'a Sanity— And is Corroborated by Several Other Witnesses— The Prisoner Goes Through the Usual Circus Per . formance— Abuse Mainly Directed Against the District Attorney. Washington, Dec. 16.— The prosecuting at torney was a little late in reaching the criminal court this morning, and Guiteau improved the opportunity to make one of his little speeches 10 put in the time. Looking over to the va cant seat he said with a chuckle: "I understand Gen. Reynolds is sick this morning. I wonder if he (Corkhill) is. I guess they got more than they wanted yesterday. It's about time for Corkhill to get sick and stay sick." George D. Barnum, deputy clerk of the su preme court, Kings county, N. V., took the stand to prove the divorce of Anna J. Guiteau from the prisoner. ' Witness presented the rec ord of the court and an order of the judge for his (the witness') attendance. Here Scoville objected to the admission of the papers, upon the ground that they were not certified to by the clerk of the court as re quired by the act of congress. The court overruled the objection and admitted the pa pers as originals in the case. The paper set forth the granting of an ab solute divorce upon the ground of adultery, no answer having been made by defendant. Guiteau, referring to the woman named, with whom he had committed adultery, said: "This woman Jennings was a' high-toned woman in New York. It was purely a matter of business between us. I committed adultery with her to get rid of a woman I did not love. I thought it a much more . moral course than to live with her and have children year after year. I have been strictly a virtous man for six years past and have always been a high Christian man." Scoville desired to note his exception to the admission of the evidence. Guiteau (with impatience)— "Oh, what is the use of grumbling over that. I admit ray marriage and my divorce. I don't care for that. I can get married again anywhere out side of New York state, and for that matter in New York too. Under the new law there, if a man lives a strictly virtuous life for six years after being divorced, the courts will let him marry again. Why, I could be married in New York to-morrow if I wanted to." Gen. Reynolds was called,and Guiteau at once broke out impetulently, saying: "I hope you will cut of Gen. Reynolds and not waste any more time on him.'' Scoville cross-examined the witness. Gui- teau frequently interrupted, contradicted and insulted the witness, at one time shouted: "I would have been hung a hundred times in July last but for the national troopß, and all through your lying and Corkhil's. I'm go ing to get even with both of you two." Witness explained that when he visited Gui teau his trial had not been arraigned. Presi dent Garfleld was still living, and he (witness) had no thought of being subpoenaed as a wit ness. "You lie," shouted Guiteau. • 'You came to my cell as a spy, in the employ of the dis trict attorney." Gen. Reynolds read from notes he had taken on the occasion of his first interview with Guiteau, quoting the prisoner's words. He read: "If there is a stalwart in the land, lam he. Grant, Conkling, Logan and Gov. Cor r nell are big guns among the stalwarts and I rank with them." Guiteau retorted: "I never said I could rank with them, but as a matter of fact I think I can." A number of newspaper slips which witness had read to prisoner at this interview, to .show him what were the sentiments of Grant, Conkliug and others in regard to his (prison er's) crime, were then read by the district at torney. When the letter of Gen. Grant's was read, in which the writer speaking of Guiteau said: "My son tells me he is a dead beat," Guiteau became very angry, and shout ed: "This is what Fred. Grant says. He's a nice pill, isn't he? Hanging around his fath er. I should say he is a bigger dead beat than I am." Another passage was > read which spoke of Guiteau's crime as a most audacious act. Guiteau interrupted: "And so it was, to enter that depot and shoot down the president of the United States, surrounded as he was by all his friends. I have wondered at it a good many times how I ever did it, I thought to myself this forenoon I would not undertake it again for a million of dollars, but I was in such a desperate mood I could not resist it. I was impelled up;>n the president by a press ure I could not resist." Ellen C. Grant was called, aud Guiteau shouted : "Mrs. Grant is a lady. I boarded with her prior to the Ist of July. She is a very fine lady and I owe her $47. I trust I shall pay you soon, Mrs. Grant; as soon as thesejfellows holding fat offices shall respond to my call. (Striking the table excitedly) I made them. If they don't soon contribute I shall call out their names in meeting." VWitness never suspected that prisoner was insane. Mrs. Anna R. Dunmire, Guiteau's divorced wife, was then called. Several ladies arose to leave the court room. Guiteau moved un easily upon his seat, and looking angrily to wards the audience, cried out: "There won't be any smut in this examination. Ladies need not go out. They have no business to put this woman on the stand, unless Corkhill wants to stir up filth. I say it's an outrage on decency for Corkhill to drag this lady in here and have her character ripped up ag it will be, Corkhill ought to be ashamed of himself. He's worse than an old hoe. I ap peal to the court to intercept this infamous action of Corkhill's. Arthur ought to kick him out. I made Arthur president aud I have a right to demand he shall put some re putable lawyer in the place of the infamous Corkhill." Very much to the surprise of everyone but two or three questions were asked witness, and her statement in reply to the test question "I never, saw any signs of insanity on the prisoner while I lived with him as his wife," closed the examination by the prosecution. Guiteau, with a sigh of relief, said to Cork hill, "Thank ; ou, Mr. Corkhii], for the sake of her child"- . This is the most decent thing you have .;.>ie in this trial. I expect, however, that .Tv i<o Porter and Davidge in sisted on it, and t hej are both supposed to be decent men." Then turning impatiently to Hcoville, *'Now, cut this short, and let's have [something else." a gross-examination of Mrs. Dnnmire was tedious and wholly fruitless. As she left the stand Guiteau shouted after her: "I have not seen this la*lv for eight years. So far as I know she is a high toned Christian lady and I have nothing against her. I wish her well in whatever station she must be." Kecess. Dr. Francis B. Loring, in charge of the eye and ear infirmary at Washington, made an ex amination ef Guiteuu's eyes soon after his arrest, and did not find any indication of any disease of the brain. Dr. A. McLane, Hamilton, New York, had made diseases of the mind and nervous dis eases a special study the past nine years. Witness made three examinations of the prisoner at the jail, and had also closely scrutinized him in court since the 28th of No vember, when he (witness) arrived in the city. Witness found no defects in the physical confirmation prisoner's head, or any physical peculiarities or symptoms of congenital disease of the brain. On the contrary, he found from accur ate measurements the prisoner's head was symmetrical and exceedingly well shaped head. Witness fouu Ino external evidence of mental or physical disease on the prisoner. He consided him an eccentric man. Guiteau— "Exceedingly eccentric when I am abused. I've hud to take more abuse since this trial began than during my whole life before. I don't take much stock in this kind of business (striking the tabe and flashing his eyes upon witness. You study upon spiritology instead of craniology and you will learn something. Its the spirit that gets into the brain and behind it that actuates man." Witness was then asked: "What la your opinion on the prisoner's sanity?" Ans. — "I believe the man sane, though eccentric, and fully able to distinguish between -right and wrong and realize the consequences." Scoville noted his exception, and Guiteau, with an air of solemn seriousness added: "With all respect to this court and jury, this kind of examination don't amount to a snap. Was my free agency destroyed? That is the question for this jury to decide. I swear my moral agency was destroyed. How is this prosecution going to prove it was not? That is the short and sharp of it, and that is all there is in this case." Fending the cross-examination of this wit ness, court adjourned until Monday. ffitlnhe MOW II 

HAPTENED. A Little Unpleasantness Between Two Prominent Citizens. It might have been a Russian, a Scotchman or a Frenchman, or c'en Ital-t'-an, bnt it wasn't. The warring hosts were Capt. Eeifer, clerk of the court and Theodore Sander, dep uty state treasurer, who met at a popular pub' lie resort on Seventh street, Thursday night and engaged in a debate with sticks. A few years ago a German printing company was organized in St. Paul with Mr. Kiefer as president and Mr. Sander as business manager. A daily paper was started, and in the mutations of time the stockholders liter ally fell upon each others necks and choked themselves. Mr. Sander was unfortunately in the minority faction, and Mr.' Kiefer trained with the other crowd. Mr. Sander has al ways claimed unfair treatment in the company and that a heavy loss was unnecessarily entailed upon him. The result was that when Col. Kiefer was a candidate for re-election last fall Mr. Sander did not enthuse very much in his support. In fact we might almost say he en thused the other way. As Mr. Kiefer was de feated at the polls he was not happy and as Mr. Sander was not happy over his defeat in the printing company the fraternal feeling existing was considerably smaller than Prof. King's famous balloon which anchored in Knapheide's cow pasture. When they chanced to meet Thursday night and began a compari son of notes it did not take a great while to reach the summer solstice. The result was a resort to agressive measures, the walking sticks of a couple of gentlemen present being improvised into shillalahs with which to continue the argument. The effort to caress each other's caputs with sticks was progressing favorabiy, when mutual friends were enabled to interfere and create a cessation of hostilities. Both gentlemen were on duty at their respective offices yesterday, and by wearing their hair banged evidences of the combat were, like the canker worm gnawing at the heart, concealed. It was a hasty epi sode which both gentlemen undoubtedly regret so 'far as the public performance is concerned, and their mutual friends are hopeful that as time silvers their gory locks, and their steps begin to tot ter with age, a more kindly Christian spirit may be evolvsd which will not prevent a feeling of real sorrow in the one who may first be sailed upon to officiate upon the other with brass band ceremonies, which sooner or later must overtake all distin guished and muscular citizens. 

CLOSING UP THE CLAIMS. Examination of Witnesses Concluded— Deposition From Selah Chamberlain— Decision Made Upon Some One Hundred Claims. The claims commission concluded the hear ing of evidence upon claims upon the bond act, with that of Phillip .Fox against the Min nesota & Pacific road, which was rejected. No one of the claimants whose cases were passed for non-appearance with evidence ap peared yesterday, and it is thought, very few if any will endeavor to have their cases taken up. The feauture of yesterday's session was the presentation of a deposition by Hon. Selah Chamberlain, in which he set forth in lan guage as strong and unequivocal as it could be made, that all the employes on the roads for which he was the contractor, viz: The Minnnesota & Pacific and the Southern Minn esota, had been paid and that any claims pre sented as against those loads, were fraudu lent. The board yesterday finally passed upon some 100 claims, some of which were approved and others rejected. They hope to complete their labors by Monday or Tuesday next, when their findings will be given to the public. CITY NOTICES. Black Alpacca 25 cents a yard at 11. E. Mann, 422 Wabashaw street.

IMPEBILLED CJZAB. Discovery of Another Plot Against His Life— English Newspaper Comment on the Clay ton- Bui wer Treaty- Seizure of the United Ireland— An Attempt Will Be Made to Publish It In London or Paris- General Foreign News. BUSSIA. THE UNHAPPY CZAB. London, Dec. 16.— A St. Petersburg corres pondent says another plot against .the czar's life has been discovered which is likely to in volve those high In authority. A chamber lain of the royal palace Is the only arrest yet made. IRELAND. Dublin, Dec. 16.— The cartoon published in this week's issue of the United Ireland, which has been seized, represents Forster with a Jailor's key in one hand and a warrant marked "Kilmainham" in the other. Before him stands a figure wearing a helmet bust ling with bayonets, and with placards on its back inscribed "martial law" and "more coer cion." In front there is an array of females representing the ladies land league. United Ireland was seized by direction of the attor ney general wbi>is of opinion that the paper was a "no rent" manifesto of the worst kind, seditious and inviting to murder. The Earl of Dunraven denies the reports that his tenants received an abatement of 33 per cent, of their rent. He says the tenants paid two-thirds of their rent pending a revaluation of the land. Copies of United Ireland are being seized by the poiice throughout the country. Owing to some controversy among the landlords in regard to their proposed meeting to express indignation at the working of the land act and demand for compensation, two meetings will be held, one on the 3rd of January, of the more moderate section, Duke Abercon presiding, to criticize the land court decisions, and another on the 22nd of the pres ent month, Earl DeSart presiding, to attack the go Vermont. It is understood that United Ireland will be priated in London and thence posted to subscribers. Should the government intefere the office will be transferred to Paris, from whence copies will be distributed under cover of a London agent. The London agent re ceived two parcels of the United Ireland to day, despatched before the seizure yesterday. Two arrests under the coercion act were made to-day— one the late secretary of the Mill Street League. Bigger, member of parliament for Cavan, writes to the Free Masons' 1 Journal, objecting to any of the royal family, which is a foreign family to Ireland, opening the proposed Irish Industrial Exhibition, and saying that Davitt or Parnell ought to open the exhibition. London, Dec, 15.— A boat containing four teen persons left Galaway for Arran Island. Midway of the passage a storm was encoun tered and the boat sank. All hands perished, The lord mayor has declined to call a meet ing of the corporation to consider a resolution to confer the freedom of the city upon Parnell and Dillon, as the questien was so recently de cided by the council. AID FROM AMERICA. Dublin, Dec. 16.— News from America of increasing contributions produces the greatest excitement and gratification among land leaguers, who, in consequence of this encour agement from their Irish American friends, have showed renewed activity in their demon strations against the land laws. ENGLAND. London, Dec. 16.— The officers of twenty one telegraph and cable companies memoral izc the government and place sub-marine ca bles under the protection of the international law. The companies also ask Lord Granville to receive a deputation to present their views on the subject. The Marquis of Lome will remain in Cana da another three years, having made known his desire to complete the full term of govern ment generalship, unless recalled to take up another appointment. THE 

CLAYTON-BULWEB TREATY. The Standard, in a leading article on the abrogation of the Clay ton -Bui wer treaty, says: The question is simply whether the demand is reasonable. Never were startling demands made with less affectation of a reassuring pre text. The Americans must regret that Blame tried to justify his position with arguments that India is far more exposed to attack than is the Pacific seaboard of America. Yet when has England claimed the exclusive right to control the Suez Canal ? England has taken precaution to secure the right of way. If America cares to follow our example she will, instead of denouncing trea ties, take similar precautions. The News says : Blame's productions contain implications by no mean?, courteous or considerate toward England It is not at all improbable that what at the present moment is a difficul ty has arisen (Jhite as much from jealous of vested rights as from lust of empire. It can not seriously be the Intention of the people of America to support a new doctrine of sover eignty. The article concludes: "Least of all countries can England consent to place the control of her vast commerces in the hands of any one, however friendly, power." The Times admits that Mr. Blame's conten tion is not wholly unreasonable, but he is taking precautions against possible danger. If the United States cannot trust England why should England be required to trust the United States? The temptation to a breach of faith is remotely contingent. In one case it is quite as certain as in the ether, and with the exist ing unenlightened views of the American statesmen on commercial questions, it is like ly enough that reasons which would pass cur rent with them would be found for yielding to it. The letter of the law is on the side of England. 

GENERAL FOREIGN. Vienna, Dec. 16.— Some sensation has been caused by a banker's statement that after es caping from the burning building he pur chased three candles and hastened back in the hope of saving some sufferers, but the police refused to let him enter the building. Goettel is the name of the gentleman who contributed $62,500 for the relief of sufferers by ths theatre fire. He is an Austrian by birth. Berlin, Dec. 16.— The German minister telegraphs that he has already entered into communication with the proper imperial functionaries with a view to obtain the pro tection so urgently required for submarine cables. Pabib, Dec. 16.— The municipal council voted $5,000 to the fund for the sufferers by the Vienna theatre fire. - The prefect of police has prohibited the public visiting the De Jaet theatre until necessary alterations are made.

Asjthe Globe reporter entered Colton's. yesterday morning, the first sight that met his eye was a line of employees bringing new goods out of the packing-room and placing them on the display tables. To one who has visiled the great glass store early in the past week this may seem impossi ble, as almost everything in the line which Colton carries could be found there then. But, nevertheless, new goods are being opened up every day, and will continue to be until after the holidays at least.

Dave Hoar is one of the many honest fellows who have fallen victims to the terrible demon of rum. He might be a credit to his class, but when his periodical bums take place the old stuff gets away with him. He was before hizzoner yesterday and was reminded in a kindly way of his many promises to reform, which had all been broken. . He was sent over for thirty days to soak the rum out of him. Hon. Fred Yon Baumbach, secretary of state, is busying himself these days by attach ing his signatu re to the new bonds author ized by the late legislature to be issued to re place the old rt ilroad bonds surrendered under the 50-per cent settlement act, of which there are some 4,000 with 240,000 coupons attached.
