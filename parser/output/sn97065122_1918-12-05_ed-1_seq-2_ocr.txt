War Industrie Board hat issued aa order forbidding publishers continuing subscriptions after date f expiration, unless subscriptions are renewed and paid for. While it has been the general rule of this newspaper to stop all papers promptly, there are some few who have asked for time on their subscriptions both to the Daily and Weekly Sun. These subscriptions will now have to be discontinued under the new law. If you want the paper continued to you, send in your renewal subscription before your time expires. Any er .jneous riflection upon the character, standing or repuation of any person, firm or corporation which may appear in the columns of this paper will be glady cor rected if brought to the attention of the editor. Only sixteen more shopping days until Christmas. Now, congress, you know all about America's plans in the peace conference. The German people will never forgive their faithless leaders, who failed to destroy the allied nations. The air of expectancy that broods over Europe is not necessarily anxiety as to the exact date of George Creel's arrival. The silence that greeted the President's suggestion that the United States should apologize to Colombia was about as opposed to applause as frost is opposed to warmth. 1 The kaiser says he has friends left in America, and .would be glad to issue a statement to them had he not retired to private life. Wonder where Wilhelm got this information? We hope some of our leading citizens will interest them selves in the soldier monument movement suggested in this newspaper and will feel free to discuss the question through the columns of their home newspaper. Greeneville hasn't quite so many manufacturing in dustries as some other towns we know of, but it can be said for those operating here that they are enjoying a good business and have never experienced the ' slightest trouble, financially or otherwise. In discontinuing subscriptions to The Daily Sun as they expire upon our books, there are likely to be slight mistakes made, and we desire to say that if for any reason your paper should be discontinued before the time is out, you will do us a kindness by notifying us. The President's failure to set forth his peace plans in his message to congress raised the ire of members of both houses. President Wilson has been equal to the occasion so far and we feel sure he will be able to make a satis factory explanation when the proper time comes. Everybody is now demanding the surrender of the kaiser, his trial and conviction and punishment accord ing to the crimes committed by his bloody barbarians in carrying on the savage war into which he plunged the world. And when all the world wants a man punished it is not likely at all that he will escape. I Before criticising the delays in the forwarding of the casualty lists, as appears to be the disposition of certain members of congress, it might be well to await the ex planation of Gen. Pershing who, Secretary Baker says, is doing all that human ability can do to get the lists over promptly. It is an immense job collecting data about each of two millions of men scattered over hundreds of miles. The annual value of poultry and eggs sold is more than that of the silver, gold and pig iron produced. There is millions of money in poultry and eggs, and but small capita required. ' The annual imports of eggs in Eng land approximate 100,000,000, dozen, and into I'f United States 17,000,000 dozen a year. Here is an in dustry in which the demand is greater than our home supply. Look well to the" poultry, and they will assist you to find the "golden egg." Following his usual custom, Postmaster Gouchenour .tells us he will provide additional help at the local post office during the holiday rush in order to give our people the very best service possible. Our people have little just complaint to make at the service they are receiving from the Greeneville office. Our people do not appreciate fully just what we are enjoying in this respect. Many towns many times the size of Greeneville do not enjoy the accommodations afforded here. THE 

PEOPLE RESERVE JUDGMENT. For good or ill, President Wilson leaves for Europe without the united support of the American people. It is not so much that some of the people are opposed to Mr. Wilson's plans as it is that they are ignorant of them. He had an opportunity yesterday to take Congress and the people into his confidence on the all-important sub jects comprised under the head of peace plans, but he did not choose to discuss the matter. Consequently, while Congress and the people have only the best of wishes for Mr. Wilson in the fateful journey that he is taking, they reserve judgment, as they must do in the absence of information, on the matters with which he will have to deal. They are familiar with the "fourteen points, "..as are all the allied and enemy nations, in prin ciple; but between the principle and the application of the principle to distracted and disorganized Europe there is a world of room for difference of opinion, or even for bitterness and estrangement. No other American has ever assumed quite as heavy a load of responsibility as Mr. Wilson has assumed in going to Europe. At least, the responsibility shouldered by others has not been so pregnant with big consequence. It was not at the suggestion of the people that the Presi dent decided to go abroad. In fact, the people were at once disquieted by the news of his decision; and it was most natural that they should eagerly await his state ment of intentions in representing them so intimately in an errand so vitally affecting them. They expected from him an outline, at least, of his views, and upon his statement of them they would have gone far to acquiesce in his views, even if they seemed somewhat Utopian, for the sake of showing a united front to Europe. Instead of discussing this subject, the President chose to discuss the railroad question and other domestic sub jects, which, however interesting they may be, are nec essarily subordinate to the overshadowing plan of ar ranging the world's peace. Thus the public must remain in the dark concerning Mr. Wilson's specific ideas; and being in the dark, the people will be extremely cautious before they commit themselves. When the President goes into conference with the ex ecutive heads of the larger allied governments he will find that each of them is supported like a stone wall by the people of his country. Mr. Lloyd George has shrewdly called an election for December 15th in, order to receive fresh from the British people a mandate to stand firmly for the interests of the British empire in the peace nego tiations. Premier Clemenceau is t,he living voice of France, and France's aims are thoroughly understood by every Frenchman. Premier Orlando is backed by the people of Italy in a clear-cut program. Thus each of these leaders enjoys what Mr. Wilson now lacks; that i$n the united and sympathetic support of all the people in putting forth a clear-cut national program. Mr. Wilson unquestionably looms far above any other statesman in expressing the aspirations of the free and freed peoples of the world. His opinions will have im mense weight in the preliminary conferences, notwith standing the fact that the allied premiers are not under any illusions concerning American politics. They are as well aware as anybody that Mr. Wilson was unfor tunate at the November election and that his spokesman ship for America is therefore impaired. But they are quite ready to yield him the frst place as spokesman of the enlightened sentiment of the world. It is only when ipecific peace arrangements begin to be considered that .the allied statesmen will be slow to yield in matters di- The variety of questions covered by the peace negotia tions will be so great, and their importance so transcend ent, that the people of the United States cannot refrain from exercising their own judgment, to the best of then ability, before they place themselves unreservedly in the hands of their ambassador. They would have exercised their judgment more fully if t,hey had had more infor mation. If Mr. Wilson's power in the conferences should be lacking because of the lack of consolidated national support, it will not be entirely because of political differ ences in this country, but partly because the people do not know Mr. Wilson's intentions. Washington Post. The Russian bolshevists are seeking peace with the allies on any terms not related to internal affairs; but as internal affairs constitute the real interest the allies now have in Russia the delivery of the people from anarchy and chaos it is not likely that the bolsheviki will get a hearing. The world doesn't want peace with bolshevism, but it must be destroyed, as its unspeakable antithesis, autocracy, has been destroyed. The future peace, order and happiness of the peoples. of the world depend upon the establishment of just, righteous and humane governments responsive to the will and wishes of all the people and not a minority of them, and that mi nority the most ignorant, bloodthirsty and selfish of all. The Sun has been deluged with soldier letters, and we would be glad to publish all of them, but we find that many of them are purely personal and concern only those to whom they are addressed. We will continue to print as many as possible, however, and especially those of a general public interest. Many of these letters are hur riedly written and in preparing for publication require careful editing, and we have not the time to do this. Anyone sending a letter for publication will please send return postage, so that in case it is rejected it can be returned. The editor of The Daily Sun is indebted to Mr. Henry R. Brown for the good letter he sent us yesterday. We feel that much good will result from the suggestions he had to offer. If the patrons of The Daily Sun over looked this letter in Wednesday afternoon's paper, we hope they will look up their paper and read it. S Jl
