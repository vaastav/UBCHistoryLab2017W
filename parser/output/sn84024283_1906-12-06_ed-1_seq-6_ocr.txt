THE PRESIDENT'S E Recommends Legislation on New and Important Subjects. INCOME -INHERITANCE TAX He Believes Such Laws Would Curb Growth or Fortunes to Dan gerous Proportions. His Views on Negro Question Asks for Currency Reform, and 8hipping Bill Would Make Citizens of Japs Discussed. Washington, Dec. I. The notable fea tures of President Roosevelt's annual message to congress are his appeal for the enactment into law of several bills introduced Into congress last winter and spring: his views on the negro problem; the scoring he gives those whom he terms "preachers of discontent;" the stand he takes for the control of corpor ations by the federal government under the Interstate commerce clause of the constitution, and his recommendation for n Inheritance and income tax law. Many other subjects common to mes sages of the chief executive are touched upon, but the ones mentioned are by far of the greatest importance. He es- peclally urges the passage of the bill ' prohibiting corporations from contribut ing to campaign funds, and also that one which would give the government the right of appeal In criminal cases. Of this he savs; "Another bill which has just past one house of the congress and which is ur gently necessary should be enacted Into law Is that conferring upon the govern ment the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states; It exists in the District of Columbia by act of the congress, it Is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the de- lunuaui un me mencs biiouiu uu wi aside. Recently In one district where the government had indicted certain per sons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained the defend ant's demurrer; while in another Juris diction an Indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced to impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be In real conflict with each other. but it is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres nt there is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when It occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a. higher court; and tire wheels of justice are blocked without any reat decision of .the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill in question. A fullure to pass will result In seriously hampering the government in its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy individuals or corporations who o wrong; ana may also prevent tne government from obtaining justice for wa&'eworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a case were the judgment of an Inferior court has fceen against them. I have specifically in view a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway employees with out remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the Judgment of the Immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional," and then to deny to the government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion.'; Injunctions. " On th subject of the abolition of In junctions In labor disputes, he says: in Illy tUBl IIICB.aBD & BUeBDBLDU 11119 eil- actment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunctions, attention hav ing been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of apply ing injunctions In labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation would be Ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of injunctions. It Is criminal to permit sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and If men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the moBt summary and effective -way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. The Negro Problem. The negro problem is givon considera ble attention, after calling attention to the fact that no section of the country Is free from faults, and that no section has occasion to Jeer at the shortcomings of any other section, he turns to the sub ject of lynchings, and especially as ap plied to the negro of the south. He says the greatest existing cause for mob law Is the perpetration by the blacks of the crime of rape, a crime which he terms ven worse than murder. He quotes the admonitions to the white people spoken by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re cently, and then says: "Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the ne gro criminal whd commits the dread ful crime of rape; and It should be felt as In the highest degree an offense against tho whole country, and against the colored race In particular, for a colored man to fall to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such Infamous offender. Moreover, In my Judgment, the crime of rape should 'always be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault with In tent to commit rape should be made a -capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by Just so much a loosening of the bands of civ ilization: that the spirit of lynching Inevitably throws Into prominence In the community all the foul and evil - creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part In the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means Just so much moral deterioration In all the children who have any knowledge of it, and Iherefore Just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans. , "Let Justice be both sure and swift; mil ihl 11 u jubuuv ui uci uic invr. And not the wild and crooked savagery Jl a Dim i - .;-. Capital and Labor. On the subject of capital and labor the president takes the agitators of class hatred to task and says "to preacfe hatred to the rich man, as such, . . . to seek to mislead and Inflame to mad ness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which, will permit them to ap preciate the danger In the doctrines preached is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every Worthy principle and tradition of Amer ican national life." Continuing on tills fcuhlect he says: "The plain people who think the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, the men to -whom American traditions are dear. i who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe It to themselves to remember that the most -damaging mow mat can De given pop - ular government Is to elect an un r worthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. whenever such an Issue is ' raised In -this country nothing can be gained by . filnchinar from it, lor in sucn case asm oorecv Ir Itself on trial, popular self' - government under republican forms la Itself on trial. The triumph of the mob Is lust as evil a thing as the trl-. ' ' vmph of tho plutocracy, and to have scaped one danger avails nothing whatever If we sucuumb to the other. In the end the honest man, whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to tear from the Insincere and unworthy demagog, promising ! xnueh and performing nothing, or else A UAL 

MESSAG performing nothing; but evil whs would set on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty corruDtionUt. who. for his own ends, would permit J tne common people to De exploited by the very wealthy. If we ever let this government fail Into the hands of men of either ef these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America's past. Moreover, the demagog and corrup tionist often work hand fn hand. There are at this moment wealthy reaction aries of such obtuse morality that they regard the publlo servant who prose cutes them when they violate the law, or who seeks to maun them bear their proper ehare of the publlo burdens, as being even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the. mob to pluder the rich. There Is nothing to ch-yose between such a re actionary and such an .agitator; funda mentally tney are an ice in tneir eeinsn disregard of the rights of others; and It Is natural that they should join In opposition to any movement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even Justice to all." Railroad Employees Hours. He asks for the passing of the bill lim iting the number of hours of employment of railroad employes, and classes the measure as a very moderate one. He says the aim of all should be to steadily reduce the number of houra of labor, with as a goal the general In troduction of an eight-hour day, but In sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the conditions are so different from what they are here that the Introduction of an eight-hour day on the canal would be absurd, and continues, "just about as ab surd as It Is, so far as the Isthmus is concerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the work Is done by alien black men or alien yellow men." He urges the enactment of a drastic child labor law for the District of Co lumbia and the territories, and a federal investigation of the subject of child and female labor throughout the country. He reviews the work of .the commission appointed to investigate labor conditions In the coal fields of Pennsylvania In 1902, and refers to the wish of the commission "that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be called the compulsory Investiga tion of controversies between employers and employes when they arise.1' "In this age of great corporate and la bor combinations, neither employers nor employees should be left completely at the mercy of the stronger party to a dis pute, regardless of the righteousness of their respective claims. The proposed measure would be in the line of securing recognition of the fact that In many strikes the public has Itself an Interest which cannot wisely be disregarded; an Interest not merely of general conven ience, for the question of a just and proper public policy must also be con sidered. In all legislation of this kind it Ib well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actual results; the step proposed can surely be safely taken, for the decisions of the commission would not bind the parties In legal fashion, and yet would give a cnance ior puouc opin ion to exert its full force for the right." Control of Corporations. X considerable portion of the message Is devoted to the subject of federal con trol of corporations in what he refers to the passage at the last session of the rate, meat Inspection and food laws, and says that all of these have already justi fied their enactment, but recommends the amendment of the meat inspection law so as to put dates on the labels of meat products, and also to place the cost of Inspection on the packers rather than on the government. Continuing on this subject of the control of corporations by the federal government ne Bays: "It cannot too often be repeated that ex nArlfnrp has onnHllsfvolv shown the ttn possibility of securing by the actions of nearly nair a nunurea amereni legislatures anything but Ineffective chaos In the way of dealing with tho great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state. In some method, whether by a national license law or In other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, .a far more complete control than at present over these great corpora tions a control that will among other things prevent .the evils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the disclosures by each big corporation of ItB stockholders and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a Btop to the secur ing nf innrrilnatn nroflts bv favored individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers. Our effort should be not sn much tr nrevnnt consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to see that It results In no harm to the people. The reactionary or ultracon- servative anoiosists ior tne misuse ui wealth assail the effort to secure Buch control as a sten toward socialism. As a mailer or. tact it is tnese reactionaries and ultraconservatlves who are them selves most potent In Increasing socialis tic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the consequences of a dAneftrnus airttation. wnicn is BU per cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent. ot evil as to wnicn tne agnaiiou is won founded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental ownership of railways is to secure by the government on behalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of the great interstate com mon carriers as will do away with the evils which give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antldot6 in the dansrerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such is to secure by proper legislation and execu tive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain In con nection with the business use of wealth under our present system or rather no system of failure to exercise any ade quate control at all. Some persons speak as if the exercise of such governmental rntrni would An awav with the freedom of individual Initiative and dwarf Indi vidual effort. This Is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fall to fiut a premium upon Individual initiative, ndlvidual capacity and effort; upon the energy, character and foresight which It is so important to encourage In the individual. But as a matter of fact the deadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of Its extreme form communism, and the destruction of Individual character which they would bring about, are In part achieved by the wholly unregulated competition which results In a single Individual or corpor ation rising at the expense of all others until his or Its rise effectually checks all competition and reduces former competi tors to a position ot utter inferiority and subordination. Inheritance and Income Tax. It was expected that the president would refer In some way to his .belief In the necessity for the curbing ot enor mous fortunes, and he has done so by recommending legislation for both In come and an inheritance tax. He be lieves the government should Impose a graduated Inheritance t r, and, If possi ble, a graduated income tax. He says: "I am well aware that such a subject as thle needs long and careful study In order that the people may become famil iar with what Is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceed ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and may make up their minds just how far they are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators can work out the project In necessary detail. But I feel that In the near future our nation al legislators should enact a law provid ing f a graduated Inheritance tax by which a steadily Increasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other Valuables coming by gift, bequest, or devise to any Individual or corporation. It may be well to make the tax heavy in proportion as the Individual benefited IB remote of kin. In any event, In my Judgment the pro rata of the tax should increase very heavily with the Increase of the amount left to any one Individual after a certain point has been reached. It la most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and ambition Is the desire on the J art of the breadwinner to leave his chll ron well oft. This object can be attained by making the tax very small on moder ate amounts ot property left; because the prime object enould be to put a con stantly increasing burden -on the inher itance ot those swollen fortunes which It Is certainly of no benefit to this coun try to perpetuate. There c&o be no question of the eth ical propriety of the government thus de termining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritance should be received. Exactly how far the Inheritance tax would, as no Incident, have the effect ot limiting the transmission by devise or flirt of the enormous fortunes In question t Is not necessary at present to discuss. It Is wise that progress in this direction should be gradual. At first a permanent national Inheritance tax, while It might be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not approximate, either In amount or In the extent of the Increase by graduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be. Agricultural Interests. '' He appeals for every enoouragement that the congress can give to the agri cultural Interests of the country. He points to the good, that is being done by he various forms of grange organisa tions, and says: "Several factors must cooperate In the Imnrovement of the farmer's condition. He must have the chance to be educated In the widest possible sense... the sense which keeps ever In view the intimate relationship between the theory of edu cation and the facts of lite. In all education we should widen our alma. It Is a good thing to produce a certain num ber ot trained scholars iwd students; but the education superintended ty the state must seek rather to produce a bun dred good citizens than merely one seaoiar, ana it must De turnea now ana then from the class book to the study of "the great book of nature Itself. Thl Is especially true of the farmer, as ha been pointed out again and again by all observers most competent to pass prac tical juagment on tne proDiems oi our country life. All students now realize that education must seek to train the executive powers of young people end to confer more real significance upon the pnrase ' dignity or moor, ana to pre oare the dudIIs so that In addition to each develatlng In the highest degree nis inaiviauai capacity ior wors, tney may together help create a right publlo opinion, and show -4n many ways social and cooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary In the business world: and It has accomplished much for good In the world of labor. It Is no less neces sary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement Is good In Itself and is capable of a well-nigh Infinite f ur- tner extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers for mutual advantage are partly economlo and partly sociological. Marriage and Divorce, i mum nf hrinrln ohnnt n.llnnd Regulation of marriage and divorce he suggests a constitutional amenament, ana says It Is not safe to leave these ques tions to be dealt with by the various states. Continuing on this subject ha ays: Wh hen home ties are loosened: when men and women cease to regard a worthy family life, with all Its duties fully performed, and all Its responsi bilities lived up to, as the life best worth living; then evil days for the commonwealth are at hand. There are reglons'in our land, and classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below the death rate. Surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilful sterility is, from the standpoint of the nation, from me standpoint of the human race, the one sin for which the penalty Is national death, race death; a sin for which there Is no atonement; a sin which Is the more dreadful exactly In propor tion as the men and women guilty thereof are in other respectB, In char acter, and bodily and mental powers, those whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see the fathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up In homes made happy by their presence. No man, no woman, can shirk the primary duties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any other cause, and .retain his or her self-respect. The president asks for the enactment Into law of a shipping bill that will place American Interests on the seas on a par with those of other countries, and urges especially that something be done that will establish direct steamship commu nication with South American ports. ; Currency Reform. Amendments to the present currency laws are asked for, and after showing that present laws are inadequate because of the wide fluctuation of Interest charges, he says: "The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system Is seri ously defective. There Is need of a change. Unfortunately, however, many of the proposed changes must he ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not easy of compre hension, and tend to disturb existing rights and Interests. We must also rule out any plan which would ma terially Impair the value of the United States two per cent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the issue of which was made under conditions pe culiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any special plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by J expert cummiiiwes oi uimiterH. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly brought to your attention by the pres ent secretary , of the treasury, the es sential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should be ' per mitted to issue a specified proportion ot their capital in notes of a given kind, the Issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. Thla plan would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency pre sented by times of stringency. - He again asks for free trade with this country for the Philippines and in the same connection reviews the work done by this country In the islands, and says "If we have erred In the Philippines it has been In proceeding too rapidly In the direction ot granting a large meas ure of self-government.'' Naturalization of Japs. President Roosevelt scores San Fran cisco and other Pacific coast cities for their ' treatment of the Japanese, and makes the following recommendations: "I recommend to the congress that an act be passed specifically provdlng for the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrassments attending the performance of our In ternational obligations is the fact that the statutes of the United States gov ernment are entirely Inadequate. They fall to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through United States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens In the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to as to enable the president, acting for the United States government, which Is responsible in our International rela tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un der treaties, jsven as tne law now la something can be done by the federal government toward this end, and In the matter now before me affecting the Jap anese, everything that It Is in my power to do will be done, and all ot the forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt aa to the power ot the national government completely to perform and enforce Its own obligations to other nations. The mob of a single city may at any time perform actB of lawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into war. The city by Itself would be power less to make defense against the for eign power thus assaulted, and If Inde pendent of this government It would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the offend ing community lies in the hands of the United States government. It Is un thinkable that we should continue a pol icy unaer wnicn a given locality may De allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the United States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the last resort, to defending the people who have committed It against the conse quences oi tneir own wrongdoing." Amerlcun citizenship should be con ferred on tne citizens of rorto Rico. The harbor of San Juan In Porto Rico should be dredged an, Improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. The administration of the af fairs of Porto Rico, together with those of the Philippines, Hawaii and our other insular possessions, Bhould all be direct ed under one executive department; by preference the department of state or the department or war. i Cuban Intervention. " The rebellion In Cuba and the inci dents leading up to the establishment of ine provisional government is reviewed, and the president says: "When the election has been held and the new government IriauirurfLtari In peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi sional government will come to an end. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American people, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will realize the Imperative need of pre serving Justice and keeping order In the Island. The United States wishes noth ing of Cuba except that It shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes noth ing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their Independence. If tho elections become a farce; and It the Insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed In the Island, It Is ab solutely out of the- question that the Island Bhould continue independent; and the United States, which has assumed the sporsorshlp before the clvllleed world for Cuba's career aa a nation, would again have to Intervene and to see that the government was managed In such orderly fashion as to aecure the safety of life and property. The path to be trodden by thoBe who exercise self-government Is always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with the Cubans as they tread this difficult parth. I have the utmost sympathy with; and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly to weigh their re sponsibilities and to see that when their new government is started It shall run smoothly, and 'with freedom from fla grant denial of right on the one hand, and from Insurrectionary disturbances on the other." On the subject of the Panama oanal ha Fromlses a special message In the near uture. ,..,- Considerable space Is devoted to the International conference ot American re publics and the visit of Secretary Root to South America, and points to the fact that our efforts In behalf of fflie nations of that country are appreciated by then. 

POINT TO CONSIDER REPUBLICANS CANNOT EVADE RJJT. , ,v I 8PONSIB1I.ITY, 1 Whether the Tariff or Railroad Rebate . Evil la the Mother of Trusts, the Party in Power Has Dons Much to Foster Them . i President Havemeyer of the sugary trust stated to the industrial commis sion in 1898 that the tariff Is the mother of trusts, but now comes, the belated opinion of Attorney General Moody that "not the tariff but the railroad rebate is the mother ot trusts." Whichever of these impor tant Republican opinions is the right one is not of much consequence, for all impartial investigators are agreed that the tariff and railroad rebates are both closely related to trust plun dering and either may well be the mother and the other the father of these predatory corporations. But the chief thing is to remember that the Republican party has been standing pat while the trust fostering was in cubating and now the trust infants have grown to the stature of giants the Republican party is still continu ing to prevent legislation' that will take from the trusts the monopoly they enjoy through tariff protection. There is no escape for the Repub lican leaders, front President to state legislator, from the fact that since coming into power in 1897 and enact ing the Dlngley tariff, that the trust era has accompanied that trust-fostering law. Nor can it bo denied that since the tariff was so greatly in creased in 1897 It has been accom panied by a similar advance in the price of nearly all commodities,' until now the cost of living, according to Dun's and Bradstreet's index figures, is close upon BO per cent, higher than before the Dlngley law was passed. As the Republican leaders have taken all the credit for any advantage to business from the trust boom and have even attempted to appropriate the blessing from favorable seasons and resulting good crops, they must in return be held responsible for the enormous inereased cost of living and the great loss to those whose Incomes have not kept pace with their in creased outgo. The Republican lead ers must also explain to the farmers why the price of wheat and other ag ricultural products has fallen under the trust fostering tariff, which they have assured the farmers was to pro tect them as. well as the trusts. As long as poor crops abroad apparently kept up this Republican deception, by making a demand for our surplus wheat and other farm products and their price naturally was advanced, the Republican theory, that the tariff ben efited the farmer, appeared to the un thinking to have good grounds for be ing really responsible for prosperity. But that Republican idol has been shattered by the reduced demand for wheat and other farm products and the fall In the price . t It is therefore incumbent on the Re publican leaders, who have been go ing up and' down the land claiming that prosperity is due to the tariff,sto explain this breach in the tariff walls that has allowed the low priced farm products to get Into the tariff fort ress alongside of the high priced trust products. They must also ex plain why the trusts are to continue to have a monopoly under the high tariff law and the farmers shall still be forced' to sell at prices fixed In the free trade markets of the world in competition with the surplus of other countries that have like products to dispose of. A revision of the tariff Is obviously demanded so that the trusts shall lose their enormous protection and the consumers farmers and other people alike will be protected from paying the high prices that the trusts are protected by the tariff in imposing on all the American people. Tariff Reform Coming. The latest Republican con verts from the standpat doctrine'before elec tion were Perry Heath and Elmer Dover, who were Educated in the Han- na school of politics in "the good old standpat days." They may now be counted as belonging to the Repub lican outs, but are looking with long ing glances for the chance to be the Ins, when the political pendulunk swings their way. They evidently see that tariff, reform must come, and think that President Roosevelt has made a great mistake in surrendering to the trusts and protected monopo lists. The tariff i,ssue is ' no doubt purely a matter of politics with both those two worthies and the president and all the Republican leaders except the ardent standpatters seem ready to change their tariff coats as policy dic tates. There is no doubt that a very large number of the Republican vot ers favor revising the tariff schedules that shelter and protect the trusts, but their wishes for the present, at least, have been nullified by the allience and adroit maneuvering of the president and Speaker Cannon to prevent tariff revision. The Pure Food Law. -. 4 The Republicans claim the credit for the pure food law, but the Republican congress made no appropriation for carrying the law into effott. The ma jority of the Republican members of congress have little sympathy with the law and tried before they passed it to weaken it at every point. When It comes to voting the appropriation of $1,000,000 which Secretary Wilson says Is necessary to carry out the provisions of the law, we shall see how much, in fluence has been exerted by such op ponents as the patent medicine people and other interests that are interfered with., The law goes into effect on Jan. 1, but until provision is made for its enforcement, it will 'be a dead letter. The growth of corporations still con tinues and is increasing,, rather than diminishing., For the ten" months ending with October ; nearly one bil lion dollars more of capital was In vested in corporations than tor the same tiariod In 1904, the total for the present term being $1,824,039,000, and this vast mm is confined to those cor porations with $1,000,000 or mora cap ital. The trusts seem to be growing faster than the Republicans can un hyse them.
