ialltpalts $0iral GALLIPOLIS, DECEMBER 6, 1S66. Congress. The present session ef Congress will undoubtedly be a very important Mil rraxe and airitatiiiir n-nea. V, , O O "X tions will demand its consideration and action. Yet there are cheering indications, that the session will be ' conducted with calmness, medera tien and dignity, at least on the part . of the Union members. We trust that the anticipations of the Country in this respect may not be disappoin ted, Ur in the present condition of the country impassioned partisan de bate and bitter invective are above all things to be deplored. Congress r.a .ntaffardto waste its and the country's time in scenes of that char actor. The great questions of na tional policy, which are now being settled and which are to have so im portant a bearing not only upon the present but also the future history of ur ceuntry, these questions must oe met with sound judgment, discussea and considered with calmness and moderation, and decided as the high est wisdom and statesmanship shall deem best VTe therefore welcome the indica tions of a quiet session. The power of extreme radicalism over the Union party was broken at the last session, and we hare every reason to antici pate that in the future, instead of the iron rule of Thad Stevens and Ins pe culiar faction, we shall find wner, more practical and moderate men ruling and shaping the policy of the party. The furor of Presidential im peachmenthas also subsided, and while it still furnishes the Phillip's with an inexhaustible theme for ex citing political harangues, the sound sense and sober second thought of the people have virtually decided it to be both unwise and impracticable The President will have to commit much more flagrant acts than any yet charged upon him, before an im peachment can be sustained, and to attempt impeachment upon mere party complaints, and fail, would be foolish and pernicious. Manifestly Mr. Johnson can not be impeached for his silly conduct and rude speech es made on his grand 'swing round the circle," nor yet for his ousting Republican office-holders and filling their places with Democrats and Copperheads. And however dis tasteful to the Union party these acts of the President may have beeu, they furnish no legal grounds for his im peachment They were acts which be bad a perfect right to do, and 11 he saw fit to risk Lis reputation upon . the doing of them, well and good. The result 6hews, that they ruined him, net ns. His stupidity and folly will not justify Congress in throwing aside its own dignity, and attempt ing impeachment or any other ag gressive movement without reason and sufficient grounds to maintain it. Congress may be relied upon jeal ously to guard its own prerogatives, and to resist the first indication of any purpose of the President to as sume unconstitutional powers. But it should not allow itself to, be led into passionate or merely partisan action, at a time wbein such weighty and complicated questions of national policy are calling tipon it for consid eration and solution. We are glad therefore, that present indications are, that the impeachment nonsense will be wholly ignored at the present session. The alarmist and extrem ists will have to take back seats. Yet Congress need not bo idle. There is much and Important work before it The grest work of recon struction still stands uncompleted. The Southern States are still unrep resented in Congress, still virtually nut kf thaii Tiro rit !s a I rnlaf inna with the General ' Government It is true that Congress, at its last ses sion, devised and embodied in the Constitutional Amendment a plan of reconstruction, wise, generous and practicable, and that the loyal North, at the Fall elections, approved that plan with wonderful unanimity.' But it is none the less true, that this basis f reconstruction still tUml unac cepted by the South who, as hereto - fore, refuse all terms and conditions Other than those dictated by them selves. What further legislation, if any, is needed, in view of these facts, must engage the early and earnest consideration of Congress.. Our for eigu relations too are at this time as ..

The Meteoric Shower in Great Britain. Tbe -Astronomers did net fail in their calculations concerning the Me teoric shower after alL Though we, of the Western Hemisphere, did not have the pleasure of witnessing the spectacle, still an unusual display of meteors occurred at the time desig noted, which were fully visible in England and Scotland, on the morn ing of November 14tb. The English papers are filled with the accounts of parties, who made observations at different points in Great Britain. From these accounts we gather that the spectacle was grand, indeed The display seems to have been the finest in the neighborhood of Lon don. We cive below an account taken from the London Times, as being the fullest and most elaborate statement of the Meteoric shower we have seen: 

OBSERVATIONS BY MR. HIND. Mr. J.' R. Hind, the celebrated astronomer, record his obserrations ia tbe following let ter to the Time : "7e tie Editor of far Timet: . . "Sia: The predicted shower cf meteors baa been witnessed here during the put night nnder very faTorable atmospheric cir cumstance. In addition to Ur. Wis and myself, oar observing force included II. du Chailln (who kindlj volunteered his assis tance on the occasion) and Dr. Hampshire. From midnight to one o'clock A. M., Green wich lime, 1,120 meteors were noted, the nntnbet gradually increasing. From 1 A. ii. to lh. m.5s. no less than 514 were coun ted, and we were conscious of having missed very many, owing to the rapidity ot their succession. At the latter moment there was rather a sudden increase to an extent which rendered it impossible to coast the number, bat after I 50 a decline became precept ibis. The maximum was judged to have taken place ahout 1:10, and at this time tbe appear ance of the whole heavens was very beautiful, not to say magnificent. Beyond their im mense nam her, however, the meteors were not particularly remarkable, either as regards brilliancy or the persistency of the trains, few of which were visible more than three seconds; indeed, M. du Chailln observed that in these respects the meteors fell iisr short of those of the April period, which he had wit nessed undera fine sky in equatorial Africa. From 1 J2 to 2.-09, 300 were registered; from 3-09 to3A4, 100; from 4 43 to S. the number seen was 13, and these mostly faint; and from 5:45 to 6, only fire were counted. 'No person acquainted with the constella tions, who carefully watched the display of last night, could nave any doubt as to tbe accuracy of the astronomical theory relative to these bodies. The radiant in Leo was most strikingly manifested; while the meteors in the opposite quarter of the sky traversed areas of many degrees; in the vicinity oi the di verging point they shone out for a few seconds without appreciate motioa. and might have been momentarily tuiMak'n tor stars by any one to whom the configuration of the heavens in that direction was not familiar "Several very vivid flashes of lightning were remaikcd during th night. The last, at 3h 54m-. was particularly brilliant, of a de?p orange color, and apparently emanated below the radiant in Leo- Ths boriawn in that auarur was occupied by a pale elow, re sembling what has olten leen remarked dur ing exhibitions of the aurora borealis. "A telegram from Mr. Bishop, who watched the phenomenon during the night at Wey mouth, mentions 1 A. M., as the time of maxi mum, which is in accordance with the deter mination made here. 'I sir, obedient servant, "J. R. HIND. "Mr. Bishop's Observatory, Twickenham, November 14." The New Gospel Still Spreading. We keep up " our record of the spead of "negro suffrage" amongst the Democracy, It is funny to con template in view of past experience. But Democracy, "any how," is a curious compound a sort of "visible admixture" of inconsistency and im pudence and we must not wonder much at any thing it may do. ' The Chicago correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette says: The Detroit correspondent of the Chicago Tribune writes to that jour nal that the Democracy of Michigan, led by the Detroit Free Press, which has been more ferociously aoti-segro, and ' more stubbornly prejudiced against negro voting than any papei in- the West, except the Chicago Time, will within a brief time come ont as a unit in favor of uncondition al negro suffrage. In fact, they will in this sentiment out-radical the Rad icals. . This movement will not ctme in response to any new light that has penetrated the dark and despondent 6ouls ef the democracy, but on the contrary, the position is forced upon the party as a saving grace, simply to secure it from annihilation. We had marked further extracts two of special importance from the leading democratic papers of Wes tern New York-one published at Rochester and the other at Buffalo bt some one has carried off the pa per containing them, and we can only say that - whereas - they were once "negro haters," behold they are now "negro worshippers."

CoZ Assembled on Monday last I The Fresideat's Message wras eent in and read the aame day. The Presi dent adheres to his policy, and docs not present any new propositions. An abstract of its contents was sent out in advance of its delivery, from which we make the following ex tracts : . 

WASHINGTON, December 2. The President's annual message will be delivered to 'Congress at about one o'clock P. M., to-morrow. Probably at no previous period has speculation been so rife and as wild regarding its contents. It will be found, however, that none of the recently agitated ques tions of amnesty and suffrage are oi . luded to in the message, in the slight est particular, nor does he intimate or propose aay amendment to the Constitution, as represented, but. on the contrary, the President adheres firmly and closely to his -policy of restoration, and urges it itu re newed vigor on Congress. The Pres ident opens his message with the proper thanks to the Providence which has preserved the land from pestilence, and then proceeds direct to the consideration of tbe national situation, opposing, as will be seen, the making of any conditions prece dent to restoration, except those known to the Constitution, and fa voring the immediate admission of riuly qualified loyal Representatives to Congress. He asks nothing more ; he concedes nothing less. He speaks as follows on Mexican affairs: "In the month of April last, as Congress is aware, a friendly agree ment was made between the Emperor of France and the President, for the withdrawal from Mexico ot the French expeditionary forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in three detachments, the first of which it was understood was to leave Mexico in November, the second in March, and tbe third in November, 1867. Immediately on the completion of the evacuation, tbe French Govern ment was to assume the same atti tude in regard to non-intervention as is held by the United States. Re- j peated assurances Lave been given 1 tbe Emperor since that agreement j that France would complete the! Dromised evacuation within the pe-1 nod, or even sooner. It was reasonably expected thati the proceeding thus contemplated j would produce a crisis of great po- j litical interest in the republic of: Mexico.- The newly appointed Sri a-1. ister of tho United States, Mr. Camp- j bell, was therefore sent forward on j 9th to assume his function. It , was also thought expedient that be I should be attended in the vicinity of; Mexico by the Lieutenant General of i the United States Army, with the view of obtaining such information as might be important to determine the course to be pursued by the Uni ted States in re-establishing and maintaining the necessary and prop er intercourse with Mexico. Deeply interested in the cause of liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvi OUS duty on our part to exercise whatever influence we possessed Tor the restoration and permanent e-, tablishment in that country of a do-1 mestic and republican form of gov- ernmeiifc. Such was the condition of affairs in regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d of November, ollieifd information was received from Paris that the Emperor had some time before deci ded not to withdraw detachments of his force in the month of November, according to agreement : but this de cision was mace for the purpose of j withdrawing the whole of these forc es in tile ensuing spring. Of this latter determination, however, the United States has received no no tice or intimation, and so soon as this information was received by this Government, care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of France. T ran nnt fnroTft tha IinnA thftt France will ro consider the subject! and aoopt some resolution in regard ! to the evacuation of Mexico which will conform to the existing engage ment, and meet the expectations of this Government. The documents on the subject will be luid before Congress.- With the evacuation of Mexico by the French, no subject for serious differences between France and the United States would remain. - On oar relations with Great Brit ain the President writes as follows: ".It is a matter of regret that no eon-1 siderable advance has been made to-, ward an adjustment of the difference between the United States and Great Britain, arising out of the depreda tions on our national commerce, and other trespasses committed during the civil war by British subjects, ia violation of international law and treaty obligations. j The delay, however, may be be i Iieved to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of Ministry occurred in that country during the last session oi Parliament The attention of the new Ministry was called to the subject at an early day, and there is 803 e reason to be lieve that it will be considered in a becoming and friendly spirit The President alludes to the Fenian invasion of Canada as a violation of the neutrality laws and the proclama tion wbieh he issued, and on the trial and sentence of captured Fenians be says : Such represents tions have been made to Great Brit ain as will, it is hoped, induce judi cious amnesty to all who were en gaged in the invasion. - , . The President concludes as fol lows : ' i In tbe performance of a duty im posed bv tbe Constitution, I have submitted to the Representatives of the States and the people such in formation of our domestic and for eign affairs as the pnblic interests may require. Our Government is new undergoing its most trying or deal, and my earnest prayer is, that the peril may be successfully and fi nally passed, without impairiag its original strength and symmetry. The interests of the nation are best to be promoted by tbe revival of fra ternal relatione, tiie complete oblit eration of our past differences, and the inauguration of all the pursuit of peact. Directing oar effort to t i A fice Vi a narlv iKPAmnlialitnanl eif thm great ends, let ns endeavor to pre serve harmony between the co-ordinate departments of the Government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in securing the maintenance of the Constitution, tbe preservation ef the Union and the perpetuity of free in 

ANDREW JOHNSON. Mexican Question. I ue present week has jnven us additional facts and rumors touch mg the Mexican question. The French Emperor not removing bis troops as rapidly as contemplated in his former agreement with our gov ernment, Secretary Seward, for once grown valiant, rushed for the Atlant ic Telegraph, and at a cost of 819, 000 in gold, forwarded to our Minis ter at Paris a very "belligeranf dispatch. This had the desired ef fect, and Napoleon now faithfully promises that the French troops shall at once be removed. Maximil- lian has abdicated in totn, and Mar shal Bazine, the French Commander. in-Chief, it is said, is only awaiting the arrival of Gen. Sherman to turn over to him the remnant of the ex ploded Empire. From the. K:o Grande we have the startling rumor that Gen. Sedgwick has crossed with American troops and occupied Mata moras. Sheridan promptly disowns all knowledge of the act, and Gen. Grant has ordered the removal of Gen. Sedgwick, if it projres true. The Mexican question is truly grow ing important, and unless Congress takes some speedy action, we stand in a fair way to become involved in its complications. r. a. abater news does not con firm the crossing of Gen. Sedgwick, but rather contradicts ;t Opening of Congress. Special Dispatch to Cin. Gazette.

There was little of special interest in the proceedings -of this body, be yond the introduction of Mr. Sher man's bill to prevent persons from holding oflices for which they have beeu rejected by tho Senalc. Tlie message was received with out any demonstrations either of S'ilUfaclion or dissatisfaction, aad the Senate adjourned immediately alter it was read. IN THE HOUSE. The proceedings in the House were of much interest, and held the undivided attention of a very intelli gent audience. There was about 115 members present, and all the bills and motions indicated strong and r.idicr.l diiferences between the ma jority and the President's friends. The message was not read without an effort to throw it over until anoth er day. A motion to adjourn before beginning the document was lost by only one majority, .and a similar motion, when the reading was half completed, was also lost by one majority, on" a call of yeas and nays.

Grant has been less reticent of lato on the subject of reconstruc tion with ex-rebels. . He plainly told them that they mistook their posi tion. They had openly made war upon the Government and appealed to arms, and had been defeatetiand that they were now nothing more nor less than on their parole. The rights that they talked about had been for feited by their treason, and their re- turn to their former positions in the Government laid in the hands of the Government through Congress.

News has been received here of a highly interesting character in refer ence to the arrest of another of the assassins of Abraham Lincoln. John H.

Our Consul General at Alexandria, ia Egypt, Mr. Charles A. Hall, had been warned some days before by in telligence from Italy that Surratt would probably take refuge in the ! East, and consequently kept a sharp lookout day and night for the guilty nan. It is said although we have not yet received full particulars tnat Surratt's own imprudence, or rather his own fear, at last led to his discovery, and yesterday the vigilant Consul General succeeded in captur ing him. He was immediately put under the closest guard and probably is ere this time on bis way to Amer ica to be tried, convicted and pay the penalty of his enormous crime. Me comprenez vous !
