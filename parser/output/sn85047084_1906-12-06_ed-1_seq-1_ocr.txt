When Mr. Coerper sat down at his accustomed place in the dining room he found a piece of paper torn from the top of a newspaper on which was written the Birbe address as noted above, lying near his plate, and it was in Birbe's well known handwriting. The waiter supplied the information preceding the address. On Tuesday night Birbe had a talk with Mr. Coerper who at one time em ployed him in a clerical capacity when Mr. Coerper was promoting the est Hawaii Railway. Mr. Coerper has al- day by Coerper nor was he in his usual haunts. "I don't know just why Birbe Intend ed leaving, other than what he told .me," said Mr. Coerper last evening "It is my opinion that Birbe has been used as a tool by some people and that he has found that be has been Just a tool for others and has got good and tired of it and decided to clear out. The address he left with me is the ad dress of his folks in San Francisco who are very nice people." Other opinions are that Birbe want ed to avoid the grand jury and the fraud issue in the courts.

The Governor had been requested to appear by U. S. Immigration Com missioner Sargent, those others present Leing Commissioner Sargent, R. S. Brown, U. S. District Attorney lirecKi ins. The Governor was asked regarding the statements in the Honolulu papers that the Planters' Association had had a share in bringing the immigrants to the Territory, the papers speaking of their arrival as "an achievement" for the association. He was also question ed regarding the alleged allotment of the immigrants among the plantations. It was explained to Mr. Sargent that the Territory had made a special offer of land and had given other induce ments regarding the domiciling of im migrants and that through the Board of Immigration the Territorial government had brought this excursion of Portu guese from Madeira and the Azores. They had not been brought in by the Planters' Association, nor was there any compulsion used in regard to where they were to secure employment. There was no allotment made, nor were the people forced to go anywhere or to do anything after their arrival. All the expenses of the excursion had been borne by the Territorial Board of Immigration. Miss 'rtrudo Hill, daughter of Hill the railroad magnate, was married to Michael Gavin of New York at St. Paul. The C, M. & St. P. Ry. has granted an increase of wages of four cents an hour to switchmen and yardmen on the entire system.
