GROSSCUP PICKS FLAW IN MESSAGE Prominent Federal Jurist Says Jap. anese Exclusion from Schools Is Entirely Const). tutlonal B,y Associated Press. BALTIMORE, Dec. 11.— Judge Peter S. Grosscup of the United States court of appeals for northern Illinois, who is now In Baltimore on a visit, said today of President Roosevelt's message: V "It's like a crazy quilt. It covers al most every possible subject and many, of : thorn are hardly important for a president's message.'-'--' . .V J "' "It seems to me," went on the judgre, with a laugh, "that the question of pro viding shooting galleries for children might Bafely have been left to the school directors. • "The trouble with the message is that it is , out of proportion. Little things are placed side by side with big ones and all are treated from a preaching attitude. The president himself has no sense of proportion. He thinks every thing under the sun that interests him is Important enough to be put in a mes sagffto congress." . '. After reading what President Roose velt had to say on the Japanese ques tion, Judge Grosscup said: '* A Constitutional Question "That is a question of the constitu tion. The national government has no right to make a treaty that will inter fere with the regulation of schools by a- state. California or any other state has the right guaranteed to it under the constitution of the United States to exclude any one - from ■ its schools it chooses. The schools are established, supported asid regulated by the state. The state has absolute power over them. "Hence It can be plainly, seen that that part, of any. treaty made by the national government which conflicts with a state's rights to regulate its own schools is void. If the government wants to . include provisions in its treaties, it should establish national public schools in each | state, support them and regulate them. Old Trouble with Roosevelt "It is the old trouble with Roosevelt. He recommends a thing in a general way, but does not. make clear the de tails. He does not go into questions far enough.. Of course the government is being more centralized: this is neces sary, hut it does ■ not do away with the clearly drawn lines between the executive, Judicial and legislative forms. < : ■ "Has he used his simple spelling in the' message? It is a monstrosity. Those of us who were educated in old and pure Kitgllsh do not care for the new way of arranging letters. I see the supreme court has refused briefs spelled in that way.

WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 12, 190fi. HITCH IN PROSPECT Charter Limits May Interfere Franchises Cnn Only Be 21 Years Attorneys Are Endeavoring to Find a Way to Expedite Plans for Five. Mile Tunnel for Los Angeles CHARTER LIMITS CAR FRANCHISE Section 2 (25) — No fran chise, right or privilege on, through, across, UNDER or over any street, avenue, alley, bridge, viaduct or other public place, and no other franchises whatever granted by the city to any corporation, association or individual shall be granted except by an ordinance passed by a vote of two-thirds of the .whole council, NOT FOR A LONGER PERIOD THAN TWENTY-ONE YEARS. Such grant and any contract in pursuance thereof shall pro vide that at the option of the city, declared not more than three years, nor less than six months before the termina tion of such grant, the plant and property, if any, belonging to or used by the grantee or its successors or assigns in inter est, in the streets, avenues and other public places shall, at the termination of said grant, upon the payment of a fair valuation thereof, be and become the property of the city, but the grantee shall be entitled to no payment because of any valua tion derived from the franchise. Provided, howeyer, that such option shall not be exercised unless at the time of exercising the same the city shall be au thorized and empowered to ac quire and operate such plant and property. Every grant shall specify the mode of determining any valu ation therein provided for and the time and mode of payment, and shall make adequate pro vision by way of forfeiture of the grant or otherwise to se cure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates and the maintenance of the property in good order throughout the term of the grant. The first obstacle In. the way of Harrlman's gigantic plans to give Los Angeles subways, tunnels, faster direct car service to the beaches and a huge depot and office building has been met. j It' is the city's charter., Harrlman wants a perpetual fran clhse for some of his undertakings the charter limits franchises to twen ty-one years. Under the charter of Los Angeles as adopted in January, 1889 and amended In January, 1003, and Jan uary, 1905, a subway or tunnel pe tition constitutes a franchise and an such is limited In period. Doubts have been raised whether the Harrlman interests will deem It advisable to go to the heavy expense they contemplate for a period of a score of years. Those near Mr. Har riman say his policy Is to accept only perpetual franchises, but others hold that this cannot apply In large cities where sentiment, against perpetual franchises is growing. Plan Friendly Suit It is -agreed that a friendly suit shall be filed to establish the legal rights of the trolley interests which own a private right of way to use the underground area for tunnel purposes. When the council meets again this morning City Attorney Mathews or Assistant Hewitt will notify the coun cilmen that they cannot grant per petual privileges to the trolley roads because the charter forbids it. When the ordinances were Introduced Mon day Judge J. D. Pope, for the Los Angeles-Pacific and Interurban roads, maintained that the city had I no claims • underground, except deep enough below the surface to 'safe guard the sewer, water and similar pipes. He did not raise the issue of length of franchises, but merely asked the body to give its consent to the tunnel construction. He maintained that no franchise could be granted be cause it was not for use of a public highway or along any street, but more than twenty feet below the surface. .."' The City's Answer * The city'i answer will be to quote the charter section here quoted. which specifically states "under" the streets. Although ' the city's counselor will state the law In the case it will be made plain that there Is no disposi tion to hamper Harrlman In any way In carrying out the move for Improve ments and some way will be sought to adjudicate ' the conflicting opinion*. The friendly suit it is thought will be the quickest ' way to get a final decision. , The trolley Interests ¦ have - amended their requests , in the Flower street gap which, under the .' proposed or dinance, ..will, get a span of surface tracks-* connecting . the • two tunnels * (« ualluued ot ha Tnu.> SOCIETY LEADER PREFERS AMERICAN MADE DRESSES fly A*tnelat«d Press.

But that was only slight trouble as compared to that which descended upon the hundreds who braved the weather to attend the theaters. Through the down town thoroughfares, Broadway, Spring and Main, the theater-goers waded toward the show houses. At various places along the blocks boards were stretched from the gutters to the higher ground near the street car tracks, and they afforded some relief from the foot deep streams which surged like mill races from; one block to another. Men waded across, often forgetting to assist the girls or women with them, and they were compelled to ' splash through water and slush to the runl atlon of fine clothes and finer hosiery. According to reliable reports from all street corner "rubbernecks" it Is said that light pink and lavender are the prevailing shades •in hosiery this winter. . At many corners small dams were built by placing heavy sacks of sand and rock to keep the water from flood lng Into the cellars of the business houses. By 10 o'clock there 'was a continual downpour find belated pedestrians kept to the middle of the street and walked b lock.-; out of their way In the hope or effecting a crossing.

While watering lands in California that canal is taken out of the Colorado river on the Mexican side of the in - ternatlnnal boundary line and the sen ator lakes the position that the break in the river bank is due to the failure of the Mexican government to exercise proper supervision over the construc tion of the canal. He was accompanied by Director Walcotl of tlie geological survey, who also took the position that the Mexican government should be held responsi ble for the damage done. Their inter view was with Assistant Secretary Bacon, who promised to eommunleate. with the American ambassador to Mexico. Si nator Flint called especial atten tion to the fact that there has recently been a new break in the canal and thai apparently the damago has gone beyond the possibility of repair by th 3 people interested. It Is reported that from 50 to 90 ncr cent of the water of the river is again leaving the channel unrl that unless this could be turned back there would be losses to property amounting to millions of dollars.
