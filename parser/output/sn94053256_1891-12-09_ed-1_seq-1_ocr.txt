MESSAGE. DOCUMFNT CONTAINING MORE THAN 15,000 WORDS. Speaks in High Terms of the Work of the State Department Sat. Theie Is Nothing to Show that the Tariff Law Is Offensive Hopes the Depression In the Frlce of Silver Is Temporary. Washington, Dec 9. President Har rison's message was read in both houses of the t my-second congress tnis after noon. The following is an excellent condensation of the document: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: The reports of the heads of the several executive departments required by law to be submitted to me, which are herewith transmitted, and reports of the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general made directly to congress furnish a com prehensive view of the administrative work of the last fiscal year relative to in ternal affairs. In substance it goes on to say that the reports show that every question has been approached and considered. He states that the work of the state department has been characterized by an unusual number of important negotiations and bydiplomatic results of a notable and highly beneficial character. He speaks of the Behring sea controversy and says he is clad to an nounce that terms satisfactory to this gov ernment have been agreed npon. ro vision he says should be made for a joint demarcation of the frontier line between Canada and the United States, and al ludes to the boundary dispute between reat Britain and Venezuela and says that the efforts of the United States in that di rection have so far proved unavailing. It is gratifying he says, to be able to Btate that ermany, Denmark, Italy, Austria and ranee have opened their marts to Ameri can pork products. He regrets the recent disturbances in Brszu and says the lynch ing at New Orleans was a most dtplorble incident. He advocates that it would be entirely consistent for congress to make offenses against the treaty rights of for eigners cognizable in the federal courts. He rehearses the war in Chili at length and says : "During the progress of the war this government tendered its good of fices to bring about a peaceful adjust ment, but m it we were disappointed, in structions to officers and minister Santiago enjoined absolute non-interference. I am satisfied these instructions were observed. No of ficial complaint of the cor duct of our minister or of our naval officers have been presented to the government. The Ameri can ministers acted upon the inpulses of humanity, extending asylum to those whose lives were in peril. It is beleived that lihili is not in a position to deny this ight. The treatment of our minister was such as to call for protest, and it gratifying to observe that unfriendly measures were rescinded. Kelative to the killing of seamen on the Baltimore, he says: "This government is now awaiting the esnlt of an investigation which will soon be communicated to the government, to gether with some adequate and satisfacto ry response to the note by which Chili's attention was oalled to this incident. If these great expectations should be disap pointed or further needless delay inter vene, I will by special message bring this matter again to the attention of congress for action." He says the entire corres pondence with Chili will soon be sub mitted. He renews the recommendation to enable this government to apply in case of Nor way and Sweden relative to levying ton nage dues; says the government oaa do no less than insist on protecting our citizens in China, and that he felt it necessary to point out to the Chinese government the untenable- ness of their position In not receiving Mr Klair as minister. He says congress will be called upon to consider the expediency of makinu provision for temporary ad mission of Chinese artisans in connection with the Columbian exhibition. He al ludes briefly to the rights of Americans in the Caroline islands, and the surveys for the projected inter-continental railway, and says an appropriation is necessary to enable the United States to fulfil its treaty obligation. He speaks of our friendly relations with Hawaii as testified in the death of King Kalakaua. He says it is incumbent to conserve the initiative the United States has taken relative to the arbitra tion treaty formulated by the international American conference, and refers to the fact that the government has found occasion to express, friendly, with much earestness to the government of the czar, its serious concern be cause of harsh measures against the Hebrews in Russia. He says the imm-i gration of these people to the United States it likely to assume nronortions which may make it difficult to find homes and employment for them and says it is neither c;ood for them or us. He deems it to be a matter of highest con cern that the canal between the Atlantic and Pacific be speedily constructed and at the smallest cost, and refers to . it as the most important subject now connected with the growth and progress of the United States, he tl inks a guarantee of the bonds of the Canal company conld be so given as not o involve any serious risk. He reoom mends legislation that shall pla e labor contracts on the island of Navassa and other islands nnder supervision of a commissioner to e force human treatment. He touches on the Internation al copyright and the fact that it has been secured. "The general interest in the operations of the treasury department," he says, has betn much augmented during tne past year, oy reason of conflicting predictions, but a general glance throughout the country will I think satisfy any impartial one that its results have disappointed the evil prophesies o its opponents and real ized the hopeful predictions of its friends. There is certainly nothing to suggest that the existing tariff and revenue legislation bears oppressively upon the people, or re tards the commercial development of the nation. It cannot be denied that all the conditions of prosperity and general con tentment are present to a larger degree than ever before in our history. Agita tion for radical changes in tariff cannot help, but may seriously hinder business. to the prosperity of which some degree of stability in legislation is essential. I hope the depression in the price of sil ver is temporary, and that a further trial of this legislation will more favor - ably affect it. The increased volume of currency thus supplied was needed, and beneficial results nave followed. Nor should it be forgotten that for every dollar of these notes issued a fuu dollars worth of silver bullion Is at the time de- 

EVENING DEMOCRAT, WEDNESDAY, ... . - - posited in the treasury as security. Upon the subject is upon the tariff my reoom- j mendation is that the existing laws be given a fair trial and that our business in terests be spared the distressing Inunence which threats of radical changes always impart. Under existing legislations it is in the power of the treasury department to maintain that essential condition of national finance, as well as of commercial prosperity the parity in nse of the coin dollars and their paper representations. The assurance that these powers would kbe fully and unhesitatingly used has done much to produce and sustain the present favorable business conditions. I am still of the opinion that free coinage would disastrously affect our business interests. We could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power of the gold and silver dollar. The producers of the country,its borrowers and loaners want one dollar as good as anotner To place business on a silver basis would mean a contraction of the currency, dj the withdrawal of gold and gold notes, and such an unsettling of ill va'ues as would prod u e a commercial ranio. The producers of tilver are entitled to just consideration, but they shout 1 not forge' that the government is now buying and putting out of the market, what is the equivalent of the ent re product of our silver mines. "I believe that a full coin use shall be made of silver just as soon as the co-operation of o her nations can be secured, and a rate fixed that will give circulation equally to gold and silver. The business of the world requires both metals, but I see no prospect of gam, but of loss, by giving up the present system. Such an event would be fatal to the progress of the silver move ment. Bimettalism is the desired end and the true friends will be careful not to ever run the goal." He touches on the report of the secre tary oi' war and the progressive business like administration of the department and says in army affairs especially good work has been accomplished. He advocates the three battalion organization and the adoption of smokeless powder and a mod ern rifle. He concurs in the recommenda tion of the attorney geneial that the right in felony cases to a review by the supreme court be limited. He rcommends a reform school in the District of Columbia: legislation as will remedy the deflects of the law prohibiting the coming of Chinese to the United States, and calls attention to the necessity of extending jurisdiction of the United states courts as to make triable any fel ony committed in the act of violating a law. He calls attention to the inadequacy of laws relative to crimes and chastity in the District of Columbia. He touches on the gratifying report of the postmaster- general, the increased postal revenues: establishment of ocean mail post- omces, general extension, and sat isfactory experiments of the service, He refers to the efforts to increase the ocean mail facilities under the American flag, and commends to consideration the completing of a navy of the best modern type, large enough tor the. protection of our citizens and extending commerce. Indian affaiis are referred to briefly. He says: "It seems to me that there shall be before long some organic changes relative to the Indians. What form they suggest is not desirable to suggest, even if defined in my own mind. But they should cer tainly involve the acceptance of citizen ship and a representation in congress. Kelative to pensions he says great care has been taken to exclude fraudulent claims, and refers to the gratifying fact that persons to whom the pensions are go ing are men who rendered not slight, but substantial war service. He recommends that a commission be appointed to report a plan for dealing with the debt of subsi dized railroads. He advocates early ap propriations for the completion of the work of the census bureau. Kef erence is made to the irrigable lands of the west, and that care should be taken in the dis position of land so that settlers can be as sured proper water supply. 'The power of congress" he says, "over repression of polygamy should not be sur rendered until we have satisfactory evi dence that the people of the state would exercise the same power." He recom mends provision to be made for organiza tion of a simple form of town govern ment in Alaska and touches on the in spection by the department of agriculture which has been the basis of the success in removal of restrictions by European gov ernments. In complimenting the size of the grain crop he says : "This marvelous addition to the national wealth is un olouded by any suspicion of currency by wnicn it is measured, and in the farmer paid f( r the product of his fields." ne says me report or the civil service commission should receive the careful attraction or its opponents as well as fnends,and recommends that adequate ap uruurittLiuua iyr increased w TK D6 made fie again argues the necessity of legislation ror tne protection or railway employes. He g-eaks forcibly against "cer-vman- a ring ana aaas mat nothing is more important than to provide every marantic- ior aosoiaieiy iair aid free choice- by equal sunrage. ne says ne believes it possible to constitute a c immission non-portisan in its membership and composed of patriotio and impartial men witn a prospect of removing or miti gating these evils. He advocates that the commission be charged with the duty of inquiring into the whole subieot of the law of elections, and appeals for a consultation that shall proceed with calmness upon the lines of justice and htt manity, not of prejudice and cruelty." ne invites tne attention of not only con press but all patriotic citizens to all these grave questions, stating that we must not entertain the delusion that our oeorjl have ceased to regard a free ballot and equal representation as the price of their BiieKiuuce to laws ana civil magistrates, xne message closes : "A trust momen tons in its influence upon onr people and upon the world is for a brief time com mitted to us and we must not; be faithless to its first condition, the deiense of the free and equal influence of:, tbe people in tne cnoioe oi puoiic omcrs and the con trol of public affairs.

YET 

ANOTHER CRANK He Attempts To Kill Chair man Edward Murphy. STRUCK HIM WITH A HATCHET. The Madman's Purpose Discovered Just in Time to Prevent Murder. Mr. Mnrpby mot Much Burt Ha Stru tted Fiercely with hit Alsatian, who Finally Overpowered A Lunatic who had Recently bean Released From nn Asylum ,No Causa for the Assault. Trot, N. Y., Dec. 9. Hon. Edward Murphy, Jr., Chairman of the Demo cratic State Committee, had a narrow escape from death yesterday afternoon the hands of a murderous crank. Daniel Murphy by nam. Mr. Murphy was about to ascend the stoop of his residence on Fifth Avenue, when hurrying footstens behind at tracted his attention. What he saw, he afterwards said, sent a momentary thrill of fear through his mind, for within a few feet of him was a tall, well built young man, with hatchet uplifted, in the very act of dealing him a murderous blow. With a bound, the young man sprang him, aud the hatchet desesndad at through the air. Mr. Murphy was for tunate enough to dodge the direct force of the blow, but the weapon, neverthe less, struck him in a arlancincr mnnnar u the right side of the neck, makinz a iight abrasion, and breaking the linen collar. Mr. Murphy at once sraoDled with his assailant and tried to wrest the hatchet from his grasp. Failing in this, a naait tbe fellow a blow in the face which felled him to the ground, and sent the hatchet flying into the middle of the roadway. Several persons who had witnessed the fray from a distance now came upon the scene, and, seizing tne would-be assassin, held him until an officer arrived. Ha was taken to the police station where ha was recognized as Daniel Murphy, an Intemperate fellow, who was but recently released from an in sane asylum. Ha is about 80 years old, early six feat in heisht and well built. Ho is naturally of an ugly and vicious temperment and has reoeatedlv been in jail for assaulting his wife. i-be prisoner denied at the station that ha had made any assault upon Mr. Murphy or that ha had had a hatchet. It was learned, however, unon investi gation by tha police, that the man had been looking for Mr. Murphy all morn -ing and had inquired of various persons wnere na was liKaly to meat him. Mr. Murphy declares that he does not know the fellow and cannot assign any reasons lor the attempt upon his life. Conductor and Englnsar Held. Trentou, X. J., Deo. 9.

The Pope has instruct ed tha Papal Nuncio at Paris, Mon siguor Terattl, to disavow tha recent action of the 1 rench Bishops in arrajr- iug themselves in opposition to the French government generally, and par ticularly to the Minister of Public Wor ship, M. Falliares. It is understood that this action was taken as a rasult of the sami-offlcial warning from Frame that tha French Ambassador at tie Vatican, Count Lefelvrs da Behame, would ba withdrawn should the French Ar hb'iHhops and Bishops eontlnue their aggravating conduct directly or indi rectly as a result of the Archbishop of Aix Incident.

The work on tne turret is being rapidly pushed and now that the stone has been procured there will be no delay in finishing that portion of the church. ihe estimate eiven for the city's share of the expense of opening Liberty street, is much too high, so taxpayers in Brooklyn claim. The amount will scarcely be $15,000. The work of filling is continually progressing. About nine years ago the railroad commission ers fixed the railroad company's share of the expense of building a bridge across tne JNaugatuck river at one-half. out since that time the legislature has voted that railroad companies must nav two-thirds of the""cost in eliminating gradelcrossings. Whether this law will hold good in- this case is puzzling some oi crooKiyn s taxpayers. A FORMER WATERBURY MAN. Tbe Brother of James J. Duffy Killed at Paterson, N. J. A telegram Swas'f received Sunday I morning by James J. jJutty, the boiler and steam fitter, living at 963 Bank street, that his brother, residing in Fatereon,. rJ. J., had died there the night previous from the effects of an accident. It seems that the deceased. who formerly resided in Waterbury, on French street, was riding on a horse car, I to a nre, Saturday night, and nearing the scene of the fire he jumped from the car and was struck by a car going in the opposite direction. The wheels passed over one leg. The iniured man was taken to the hospital, where the leg I was amputated. He failed to survive the shock and died in a few hours. His I brother went to Paterson, Monday and made arrangements for the funeral, whicn was held this morning. The de ceased leaves three motherless children. A mother and t o sisters reside in Paterson. SERIOUS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS. The Benedict Street Outfall Sewer Should be Continued Below Burnham Street Bridge. Residents of the lower end of the Brooklyn district are Incoming alarmed at the prevalence of diphtheria in that vicinity. A number of deaths have oc curred and the advent of cold weather has not checked the disease. Several causes for the spread of the contagion are given, the principal one being the emptying of sewerage into the JNauga- tucsi river near uie ouiuu&ui Bbieei, bridge. For several years the Benedict street outfall sewer has been emptied into the river above the Kurnrum street bridge. It should be removed to a point below the bridg-e. where the :low of the river is more concentrated. This was one of the late Engineer Wel l's plans and was also recommended by City Engineer Cairns. The river at the i oint where it re ceives ths sewerage is very shallow and wide, and in the dry season the stench is unbearable. The theory is that the action of the sun and nir on the sewer age whioh accumulate d in the river bed during t tie recent drv spell, generated millions of bacteria vhich were tanen up by th'3 winds and s iread through the lower end of Brooklyn, causing disease and deai;h. It has bien proven that these bac Hi can withstand severe cold, 60 that there is almost as much danger at this season as in simmer. The residents of the Brooklyn dis trict sho'uld call upon their representa tives in the city council and demand re lief. Mtrf
