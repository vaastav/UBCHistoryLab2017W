IDAHO WORLD. JA 8. O'MEARA, : EDITOR. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 15. 1866. President's Message. —The synopsis given of this important document is too meagre for fair comment, bat we most heartily approve bis sentiments and recommendations in the closing paragraph, as published; But may as well whistle against Soltis as talk reason to that Radical Congress. Quite Alike.— The Radical Congressional Caucus have a Committee of Ten to manage and execute their fanatical and malignant de signs and deeds. There was once, in old Venice, a Council of Ten. Every reader of history knows of the bad acts and secret crimes of that body. That and the Ten this day differ only in nationality, language aad time. Very appropriately named Ten. • Contemptible. —In a long article review ing the murder of Dr. Robinson in Salt Lake City lately, the 8. P. Times, (chief Radical organ) while admitting that the cause of the of the people was very ably put forward in the examination into the affair, meanly enough fails to mention the fact that Gov. John B. Weller managed it. Had Gov. Wel ler been a Radical we may be sure the Times would have given him a column laudatory notice. ! :—? Radical Logic. —Because we called atten tion last weej| to the suppression of Demo cratic papers iu the North during the war, aud contrasted the principle involved with the howlings of the Radicals, now that pa pers of that kind are not permitted in Mo bile, the Boise Statesman tries to make it appear that we favor mobbiog and suppress ing " a loyal free press in the South." Only a rogne or an idiot would place such a con struction on onr language. The Statesman can decide tbis point for itself. We are not in the Vigilante habit of mobbing either pa pers or persons. Correction.— In copying from one of the the Territorial papers the list of the mem bers of the Council and Assembly, we also copied two errors which appeared in the list, In the political classification of tbe members, namely, in placing Hon. M. A. Carter of the Council, and Hon. H. Ohle of tbe Assembly, both of Oneida county, among the Radicals. Both of these gentlemen have requested us to say that they have never been Radicals, and rank themselves •" with that party which gives encouragement and support to tbe Ad ministration of Andrew Johnson, in opposr tion to the Radical sentiment of tbe'couutry." X We most cheerfully do these gentlemen the justice they request, in making tbis correc tion, and give them hearty greeting in the patriotic stand they occupy. Military Movements.— By late orders of Major General Halleck, Military Commander of this coast, Lieut. Col. Marshall bas been relieved of the command of the District of Boise, and directed to report to Gen. Steele, at his headquarters in Portland. Brevet Ma jor General Crook is appointed to succeed Lieut. Col. Marshall in the command of tbis District, and 1st Lieut. Nickerson and 2d Lieut. Greene are ordered to report to him at Fort Boise, for duty. While we accord am ple credit to the retiring commander for hav ing performed his duty well and faithfully, and to the full extent of bis means, we join iu welcoming the new commander to the post. We have known him by reputation for many years, and know something .of his valuable services in the frontier districts of California and Oregon, where he acquired a goodly ex perience in Indian warfare, and in every po sition or emergency proved himself to be a thorough soldier and most capable officer.— Under Gen. Crook's command, we are strong in tbe belief that an effective and determined course will be pursued against the savage pests who infest this whole district, and that our citizens will, in fair time, be better se cured, in their property and life, from Indian raids. Surratt's Arrest. —The dispatches give intelligence that an U. S. Consul General in Lgypt has arrested John H. Surratt, and that he is to be sent to Washington in a Govern ment vessel. This last item alone will cost over $50,000. And for what bas be been arrested? It is said, for complicity in the killing of Abraham Lincoln. Why, it is dow thoroughly known that Stanton, Holt, and the Military Commission on that event, abso lutely murdered the innocent mother of this young man, and that Stanton and Holt pro cured and paid large sums of the public money to perjured witnesses, whom they ob tained to swear away the life of Mrs. Surratt, to 8wear to the complicity of this son, and also to convict the unfortunate men who suffered with Mrs. Surratt. If the object in arresting and bringing to the country this yopng man Surratt is to use him as a prose cuting witnegs agpjastStantoprHolt, and the other chief jaurtfog/ä his mother, the people willjf Jfy pay their share of the great exn^$^^jmisequent upon the arrest /sportatlon,—such atrocious raurdvr î a^eitlrer Éjkaton or Holt ought to be roughtto justice at any cost ; but if it is to ijrepeat tbe mock trial and commit another military or legal morder, in Surratt's own case, tbe people will be likely to see to tbe thing, and to the military or legal murderers also,XX ; THE 

RAD.CAL CONGRESS. The reflective, rational reader of the pro ceedings of Congress, as reported in the dis patches of tbe week, must be convinced thaï the insanity of Radicalism reigns supreme in both branches of that body. Even in tbe Senate, to which tbe people used to look for grave deliberation, profound wisdom, and high statesmanship, the base and malignant passions of the day seem to have deepest root, and are developed with most obdurate proscriptiveness. Tbe whole land groans and sweats under the most oppressive bur dens—enormous taxes, a stupendous public debt, and vital disorders in the great body politic ; yet it is not to relieve the country, or to ameliorate the condition of the toiling and suffering millions, that the Senate proceeds ; bat the recognized Radical leader in that body, Sumner of Massachusetts, totally dis regarding the most urgent interests of tbe people, and ignoring the traditional and con stitutional rights of citizens, hastens to bis chronic agitation of tbe negro question, and his first motion in this Congress is to procure the elective franchise for negroes in tbe Dis trict of Columbia. This action he follows by other efforts about equally divided between the elevation aud glorification of the negro, tbe persecution and debasement of the South, and the overthrow of the President. He lately declared that none but " loyal" papers ought to be allowed anywhere in the land and yet be bad always, prior to the installa tion of his own party to power, vehemently clamored for the wildest license to the press every portion of the Uuion. So, now while he professes to battle for " impartial and universal suffrage," and " absolute equal ity before the laws for all, without distinc tion of race or color," we find in the class of bills he presents for the action of Congress he seeks actually to invest only the negro and Northern born whites.to the full measure of these rights and privileges, and to proscribe early all tbe whites of the South, and the whole foreign born, naturalized population from the enjoyment of them. And tbe Rad ical Senate almost implicitly follows the lead or slavishly obeys the dictation of Sumner. The proceedings in the House also clearly manifest the spirit and intention of the Radi cals in that body. The demoniac Tbad Stevens, the Devilshoof of the fanatics, rules the roast, and nearly every measure so far broached bears the impress of his diabolically malignant nature. The steps toward tbe im peachment of the President ; the disregard of the Constitution iu tbe mad eagerness to di vest the President of all power to appoint or remove Federal officials, and to absolutely and forever confiscate and declare forfeited ►the lands of the people of the South; and to reduce the Southern States to territorial con dition, with the actual citizens divested of the right of suffrage and of all the rights and privileges appertaining to freemen therein, while all these rights and privileges are per mitted to negroes and emigrant whites,—all plainly reveal the destroying hand of extreme Radicalism, which is hurrying on the country to anarchy, chaos and another terrible war. We call the attention of the conservative men of that party, who have cast their lot in tbis remote region, to deliberate upon the action of the Radical Congressional caucus, whereiu tbe members proceeded so speedily toward the appointment of special commit tees to investigate the killing of some negroes and white Radicals in tbe New Orleans Con vention riot of last summer, and also to look into the pardoning of some persons in South Carolina who had been sentenced to death for killing three Federal soldiers from Maine. During the pts.st year—and for many years the same facts are true—hundreds of whites, men, women and children, have been slaugh tered in the vast regions west of the .Missis sippi, while on their way to or from this coast, or in their new prairie or mountain homes, and vast amounts of property have been stolen or destroyed, all by the savages who infest these distant regions. Congress has been appealed to in past years to adopt measures for tbe protection of our people, and the punishment of the marderous Indians. To this day Congress has not only not taken any action in the matter, but turned a deaf ear to the appeals. The present Congress is not ignorant of these facts. Yet, while it ignorant pays no heed to the numerous massacres by Indians of white men, women and children, on the plains and in these far-western terri tories, its Radical members rush to the work which promises them an opportunity to shed more Southern blood by mean3 of military or Freedmen's Bureau mock trials, to further glut their hatred of the Southern people, and wreak their cruel vengeance on the helpless ones they have already robbed and ruined. There are now languishing in British dun geons scores of Irishmen who are citizens of tbe United States, and who perilled their lives in fighting "the war for the Union," when cowardly natives, who were Radicals and urged on tbe war, dared not face the for midable Confederate foe. The lives of some oftbe8e unhappy men have been declared forfeited to the law by British courts. We remember when, under a Democratic Admin istration, Martin Kotza, the Hungarian refu gee, wbo had barely declared his intention to become an American citizen, was held pris oner by the mighty power of Austria, his im mediate release and surrender to the United States was made and enforced. Butthose days have passed away. The prisoners who suffer in British prisons are Irish adopted citizens, and the Congress now s"upreme is Radical. If no other reasons existed why Congress, while appointing special committees to bring pun ishment upon the citizens of the South in re venge for tbe killing of a few negroes, failed to intercede iu behalf of the Fenian prisoners in Canada, the fact that they are Irishmen, not negroes, is sufficient. All Irishmen woi thy of the name will remember this« Legislative Proceedings. For tome unaccountable reason the expected correspondence from the Capital faned to reach us this week. We therefore compile the following summary from the Boise Statesman :
