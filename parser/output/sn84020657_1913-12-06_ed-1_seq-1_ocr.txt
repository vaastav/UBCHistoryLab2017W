FRATERNALISMIN , THE NORTH COUNTRY s O-O ? ( It is a noteworthy fact that close in ? the tracks of the trail blazers of the ] Arctic and the sub-Arctic come the \ various societies for the uplift and the i benefit of the hardy frontiersmen who > crowd in to occupy and develop the i land. This may sound anomalous to ; those of the effete East who have fail- < ed to keep informed on the rapid ad- ] vance of civilization into any newly < explored country of the present day. ! Antedating all other social organiza- ( Lions in the occupation of the north- < ern parts of Canada and Alaska, and, 1 1 for that part, the Western Hemisphere, have been the churches. Scarcely do ' the most venturesome fur traders or gold seekers enter a country until the missionaries push forward into the same realm. Other organizations fol- , low at no great distauce, and especial- t ly is this so in respect to the Yukon valley and Alaska. The Yukon's first camps had their fraternal clubs. The hundreds of fear less men who denied themselves the advantages of civilized centers, and hazarded the winter in the remote camps of Fortymile and Circle formed themselves into societies. The Yukon Order of Pioneers was founded no less than nineteen years ago. It cared for the sick and needy, and buried the dead, and cheered many a brother on | the trail of life. That organization is still in existence, and rendering the same service, but there are many oth ers in the Northland. When Dawson was young it had a fraternity hall, in which many of the earliest stampeders to the camp found brotherly aid. The older orders still flourish here, and oth ers since have been added to the num ber. ?

Wagner as floor j leader, has issued a statement for the ! purpose of soun<firig out public senti-' ment on . a new tentative direct pri- j mary bill of his own making. His plan Joes not provide for the abolition of he State Convention. "1 am considering the preparation of t direct primary bill, which, while re aming the State'Convention, will take j lway from it the power to nominate candidates for State offices," he said. I 'Candidates for all offices. State and local, will be nominated at official pri maries. Primary candidates may be, lesignated either by the petition of a small per cent, of the enrolled party tote within a political subdivision, or : it a convention made up of delegates sleeted, subject to party rules and at party expense, by the enrolled party voters at unofficial primaries. The State convention may thus select the organization primary candidates and continue to formulate the party plat form." THREE VACANCIES ON INTERSTATE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.? President K'oodrow Wilson will have the appoint ment of three persons to places on the Interstate Commerce Commission within less than a month on account of the recent death of John H. Marble, ! the resignation of Chairman Charles A. Prouty and the termination of the term of Judson C. Clements that will occur December 31st. It is probable, however, Clements will be re-appointed.

CURRENCY0 LEGISLATION MAY BE DELAYED ? o-o ? BOSTON, Dec. 5. ? Washington spe cial says there is a growing convic tion in the Senate that the currency bill w*ill not be considered seriously until January, and that the debate will last about six weeks, which means that the Administration currency bill will not be passed until March 1.
