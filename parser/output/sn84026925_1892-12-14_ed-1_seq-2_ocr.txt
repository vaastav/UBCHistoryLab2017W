Jtoaps and ^acte. ; ? A few years ago, through popular subscription, the people of Georgia built a home ( for Confederate veterans. Last year an ef- , fort was made to get the legislature to provide for its support. Powerful pressure was j brought to bear on the legislature, but they ] reftiaed to make the desired provision. The , question has been an issue in the politics of ( the State during the past year, but as yet , has not been settled. The friends of the Home asked for an annual appropriation of $15,000. The appropriation was refused, but last week a compromise was agreed upon. The matter will be submitted to the people in a general election, and the legisla tare, at its next session, win act according iu the instructions received. ? Another crank jumped off of the Brooklyn bridge last Thursday afternoon. His name was Daniel McLaughlin, a Roanoke blacksmith. B.e started to ride across the bridge in a wagon, and on reaching the highest point, he suddenly jumped down from the wagon, mounted the railing of the bridge and took a header. A police boat, which happened to be below, picked him up, and he was carried to the hospital in an unconscious condition. He is now getting along first-rate, and will not sustain any permanent injuries. He was at first thought to be insane, but the physicians have determined that he was well fortified with liquor, ? and that was about all that ailed him. He will probably be punished by two or three months' imprisonment, and will then have a few weeks' engagement with the dime museums. ? Arrangements have been perfected at Atlanta, Ga., for the reception of Vice President-elect Stevenson, who will reach that city on the morning of the 21st of December, accompanied by Mrs. and Miss Stevenson, General Ewing and several invited guests from Bloomington, 111. During th8 day the party will be shown over the city, and at night the formal opening of the new Commercial club will take place, the proceedings including a reception and banquet. The vice president-elect will deliver an address. He has accepted an invitation to spend a day at Anniston, Ala., where he will be banqueted. General Stevenson will be warmly welcomed in the South, his activity in the late campaign having greatly increased his popularity in this section. ? It is a serious charge to say that Presi dent Harrison vetoed a bill for private interests, and yet the circumstances seem to warrant such a conclusion. An old man named McGamaham owns several thousand acres of valuable lands in California which has 1 proved to be rich in minerals. He satisfied i the members of the senate and house that j he had been robbed of his lands by a company of capitalists in which Whitelaw Reid's father-in-law was largely interested. After the fullest investigation the committee in ; charge of the investigation reported the ; transaction fraudulent, and a bill ih McGam- < aham's favor passed both houses without , opposition. Of course the president's veto , was a surprise to those familiar with the evi- j dence, and now it is said the bill will be passed over his veto. This is perhaps the most questionable act of President Harri- 1 son, and while it is insignificant compared with the record of Garfield, Arthur and Hayes, it is certainly not a credit to the out- : going president. \ ? Dr. J. Marion Sims, the famous South ( /UmKma will cann Yiovp a hiflr VCMUUUa |/ujoAV?auj n??4 m*?v v 0 j bronze statue in Central Park, New York. Dr. Sims was 69 years old when he died of 1 heart disease. He was born on January 25, ' 1813, in Lancaster district, S. C. He was graduated from the South Carolina college 1 and practiced medicine several years before j he went to New York in 1853. His wonder- , fill success in difficult surgical operations , soon obtained for him a great reputation. 1 He became a specialist in surgery and devo- 1 ted his entire attention to that branch of ' 'medicine. In 1855 he founded the Woman's ( Hospital of New York, which celebrated its , thirty-seventh anniversary last Thursday. It . is situated on Fourth avenue, between Fortyninth and Fiftieth streets. Dr. Sims's reputation as a surgeon in the capitals of Europe w?s very high. "For services rendered to 1 humanity," he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by Napoleon III. He ser- : ved as surgeon-in-chief of the Anglo-American ambulance corps in the French-Prussian j war. He was a grand master in the order of the Crown of Italy, a member of the Golden [ Fleece of Portugal, aud the order of Isa- ' bella of Spain, and was decorated by the king < of Belgium. He was given a valuable ring j by Empress Eugenie, which ring is now ] worn by Dr. Wyeth. ??The fourth statistical report of the Inter- < State commerce commission shows that the j railway mileage in the United States on June 30,1891, was nearly 170,000 miles, an increase of nearly 5,600 miles over that of the 1 previous year. The greatest activity in railway building was in the States lying south < of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi. ( There were 1,785 railway corporations, of ( which 889 were independent companies and 747 subsidiary, the remainder being private lines. The number of employes was 784,285. The total capitalization was nearly $10,000,000,000, the gross earnings were upwards of 1 $1,096,000,000. The number of passengers carried during the year was 532,000,000; the number of tons of freight 675,000,000. The number of killed during the year was about 7,000, and 35,000 were injured. The report recommends that the universal automatic 1 coupler and train breaker be adopted, as a 1 majority of the deaths and accidents have 1 been caused in the coupling of cars. The ] report also recommends that express compa- . nies and water carriers engaged in InterState traffic be required to make reports to the commission similar to those made by the railway. _ < ?Judge John F. Dillon, counsel for the ' executors of Jay Gould's will, has made 1 public an abstract of the will. The princi- , pal bequest is $5,000,000 to his son George, j His eldest daughter is given his Fifth avenue house, and he also gives her the use of his residence at Irvington until his youngest ' child becomes of age. To his grandson, the i son of George Gould, half a million dollars 1 is left in trust. To his daughter, Helen, is , given $6,000 per month under the presump- , tion that the minor children will reside with 1 tier until tneir majority, 10 nis oroiner, sisters and nieces, he gives specific bequests of $25,000 each, and annuities of $2,000 each. All of the property not covered by specific bequests is left in trust equally to his six children. He appoints as his executors his sons George, Edwin and Howard, and his daughter Helen. Vacancies among the executors are to be filled from his other children as they reach their majority. George and Helen Gould are appointed guardians of the minor children. The five million bequest to George Gould is stated to be a compensation for his services in managing his father's business during the past eleven years. Every dollar of the fortune is left in the family, and provision is made for keeping it together as long as possible. No charities are provided for. ? The December statistical returns to the department of agriculture, relate to farm prices. The average value of corn is 39.3 cents per bushel, depressed by the surplus of the previous crop and early distribution. It is 60 to 70 cents in the Eastern States, 55 to 60 in the Middle States, ranging from 42 to 65 in the Cotton States, 41 in Ohio, 40 in Indiana, 57 in Illinois, 36 in Missouri, 32 in Iowa, 31 in Kansas, and 28 in Nebraska. This is higher in Nebraska than for any year since 1882, except 1887 and 1890, and in Iowa in the same time the present average value has been exceeded only in the two years named. The average price of wheat is 63.2 cents. The next lowest price is 64.3 cents in 1884. In 1886, 1887 and 1890, the average was a cent or two below 70. Last year it was 83.9. The average value of oats is 31.6 cents, nearly the same as last year, as in the case of corn. Rye 54.8 cents, barley, 47.2 cents, buckwheat 53.4 cents. Potatoes 67.3 cents per bushel against 37.1 last year. Hay $8.49 per per ton, nearly the same as in 1891. The 1 condition of winter wheat, on the first day of j December, averaged 87.4 against 85.3 last! c year. In the Ohio valley the range is from | ^ 79 to 87 and low also in Kansas and Penn- ^ sylvania. It is high in New York, in the South and on the Pacific coast. In the I * Southern States and on the Atlantic coast, j' germination was delayed by drought, and the i same cause delayed both planting and growth t in the Ohio valley, and materially reduced t the condition of the crop. . ? Some weeks ago a negro Baptist preach- t er made his appearance in Jackson and t Woodruff counties, Arkansas, and repre- , sented that he was a government agent sent to prepare the colored people to emigrate to * Liberia. He organized a secret society and e collected a considerable sum of money as n initiation fees. About 800 negroes, joined the society with the understanding that they were to get free passage to Liberia. Last Friday the negroes discovered tuat Light foot was a fraud and that they had beer duped. They appointed a committee to wail on . Lightfoot and demand their money, Lightfoot refused to fork over, and the mem bers of the committee fired on him, killing him instantly. ihr ilorltriUc ^uquircr, ffiui 

YORKVILLE, S. C.: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1892 ? There is a good deal of talk about th( speakership of the next house, and consider able opposition is developing to Mr. Crisp His enemies claim that he is not an enthusias tic tariff reformer, but there is good reasor to believe that the principal ground of theii animosity lies in his failure to give them th< places they desired in the more importan committees. There may be a hard fight fo: it, but, all the same, it is very likely tha Mr. Crisp will be the speaker of the nexi house. ? In the last election, the people of th< State specifically instructed their represen tatives to pass a prohibition law. The rep resentatives have disobeyed instructions The people of the State have not called foi a constitutional convention. The legislatur* proposes to force it on them. One of thes< fine days there will come up tha question a to who is ruling this State anyway. Abou two years from now, between probibitioi and constitutional convention, we may lool for a row to which those of last summer ant two years ago were not a circumstance. ? The president's message was read ii the house and senate on Tuesday of las week. It is a voluminous document, con \ 1 taininer about 15.000 words, and treatim of the various subjects usually treated ir such papers. From a Republican standpoini it is an able paper, but to Democrats it pos sesses very little interest. The principal; enunciated and defended are a back number at least for the next four years, and we wil not inflict the text, or any part of it, upor our readers. By way of apology for oui omission, however, to those who care foi such things, we will promise something extri in this line along shortly after the fourth o next March. In the meantime, Harrison i; at a discount. ? From the best information at hand, the factory labor bill now pending in the legisla ture has few friends in this county. Among other things, the bill provides that ten houn shall constitute a day's work. That would no doubt be all right if it couid also provid< that the operatives shall recieve for ter hours work the same that they now receive for twelve. But of course no such provis ion could be made made. In the first place the legislature hasn't got the authority, anc in the second place the factories could noi afford to pay it and continue in competitior with the factories of the other States. The operatives of several mills in i,he county, we understand, having signed a protest against the passage of the bill. 9 + 9 ? An Alabama legislator has the correct ' ' ' * x? TT. 1 idea on tne liquor question, ne utu umu duced a bill that is calculated to make th< man full of liquor go to the woods, and b< very careful whose woods he goes to. Th< bill provides that any individual who goei on the property of another while under th< influence of liquor, shall be subject to a fin< of not less than $5 or more than $50. Thai is exactly the thing. Any individual shoulc have the right to get as drunk as a lore whenever he likes, provided he does not im pose on anybody else. Drunk men, how ever, are always meddlesome, and the besi way to get at them is to provide punishmeni everywhere they make other people appre hensive of bodily harm, discomfort or in convenience. Most drunk men think thej own the earth for the time being, but a lav of the kind suggested, might often be usee to effectually dispel the illusion. ? It is not at all likely that the Roper Childs so-called "prohibition" bill will gel through the legislature at this session, anc but few people will be disappointed. Th( bill is a farce and a fizzle from start to finish Liquor sold under the auspices of the State government for scientific, mechanical, medi cal and sacramental purposes only ! Doesn'l that sound thin ? Well, it is thin. Event besotted drunkard would not be silly enougt to ask the "dispenser" for wine for sacramen tal purposes. He knows that such wine is usually made by some good old elder ordea con, and never passes through the hands o: the liquor dealer at all. When it comes tc "medical, mechanical and scientific" pur poses, that is thinner still. With a dispense] dependent upon per cent, for his profit, has the dealing out of liquor to the public in his discretion, what is there to prevent his con struing the stimulation of the human brair by means of liquor applied to the stomach a scientific operation ? The whole thing is a humbug, unworthy of any body of intel ligent men. Besides, the legislature was ot instructed to provide a way to sel! liquor. It was told to provide a way tc stop it. ? The insurance companies doing business in this State are making a strong kick against the proposed law requiring each of them tc deposit $25,000 worth of State bonds with the State treasurer as a guarantee to policy holders. Among other points, they submi! that the law is not even calculated to effect the result desired. For instance, one single company has $7,000,000 of insurance in force in this State, anel $25,000 would be security for only $3 on the thousand. That argument seems to fit very well when the special abject for which it is intended is considered but it is not the way the insurance people talk ordinarily. When endeavoring to convince us of the absolute certainty of theii nsurance, they generally take occasion tc remind us of the fact that it is impossible that they should be called upon to pay all ;heir policies at once, and in the nature ol -hings, many of them will never have to be aaidatall. So, after all, $25,000 would he aretty good security. It is not likely that iny greater sum will ever he in dispute at tny one time. As to whether the proposed aw is a good one, however, we are unable ,o say, but are certainly of opinion that the egislature should require the insurance :ompanies to provide their patrons with ain)le security. ? A fierce war between the French governnent and King Benhazin, of Dahomey, has ust been brought to a close. Dahomey lies >n the west coast of Africa, and is about half he size of South Carolina. It is inhabited >y a semi-barbarous tribe of negroes, renarkable for their recklessness and bravery n battle. The French government, some nonths ago. on some pretext or other, undcrook to conquer the country. It found the ask not a small one. The Dahomcyans lave always been proud of their military raditions, and of glory won in battle by heir fathers. It has been the practice of the :ings to put to death such soldiers as ailed to do their duty in battle, and for gensrations past even the women have been iccustomed to do duty as soldiers, often i j meeting and vanquishing the most formida ' j ble armies of surrounding tribes. Wher ' {the French began the war, the natives show 'ed a determination never to give up, and tin L stubborness with which they fought aston , ished the invaders. Usually the Dahome - yans had the advantage of numbers, but un r, accustomed to the use of fire-arms, they weri mowed down to a man by the trainee Frenchmen. As the French force wus ap proaching Abomey, the capital, about si: weeks ago, they were attacked one morniiq by about 10,000 of Benha/.in's soldiers, in eluding th'c Amazons. The natives wen led by the king in person. The French formed in a square with artillery on even side. The warriors and the Amazon: charged furiously on the square. Many o them were killed within thirty feet of tin guns. Neither cannon, matrailleusc, noi volleys from quick firing rifles dismayec them, and they died almost on the bayo nets of the invaders. One of the Frencl . officers writes that he "never saw a foe ex hibit such wonderful courage. The ava lanche of frenzied men and women soldiers made three of those terrible charges upoi the French square. After the battle hat raged for three hours, Benhazin gave th< signal for retreat, which was carried out ir indescribable disorder. The Dahomeyani left over 2,000 dead and wounded on tin field." Since the country has been conquer ed, the French are making arrangements t< take possession of it, and to that end wil establish garrisons in all the principal towns THE 

GENERAL ASSEMBLY. What the South Carolina Law-Makers Ar Doing at the Capital. Following is a synopsis of the more im portant proceedings of the State legislaturi during the past week : TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6. In the House.?The first important mat ter to come up was the appropriation fo Clemson college. The committee had rec ommended an appropriation of $50,000 Some of the representatives thought this to< much, and amended by substituting $40,000 Thirty members are recorded as not voting It was provided that in case the appropria ' - J- .1 it i. t A u. 1 lion is maae, uie uonege must uc u^cucu u. the first of May, 1893.

An attempt wasmad< .' to kill the bill. This failing, it was sug gested that its provisions apply only to sen 1 tences of one year and less. The amend r ment was voted down, and the bill wa r passed to a third reading. t Mr. Hardin, of Chester, moved to striki f out the enacting clause of a-bill to repeal thi pistol and pistol cartridge law. The motioi 5 was carried and the law remains unchanged The bill introduced by Mr. Perry, o Greenville, to fix the sheriff's fee for the ser J vice of a summons and complaint at $1 in - stead of $2, came up for a second reading r In the discussion that followed, the questioi ! of sheriff's fees was thoroughly ventilated It was shown that if the sheriff only got pa? for all he did, he would be the best paid offi" 5 cer in the State ; but as he was able only t< i collect a very limited per cent, of his fees ? after all, there was not very much in hi . office. The bill was indefinitely postponed and to all intents and purposes killed. !

The county board shal say what amount of money each applican " shall receive, having due regard to the con t dition, circumstances and needs of each pen t sioner. The appropriation for pensions shal . be apportioned among the counties, in pro portion to the number of survivors and wid ows livine: therein. ' In the Senate.?Senator Timmermai ' introduced a bill to provide additional arti I ficial limbs for Confederate veterans who losi their arms or legs in the late war, who ari now living, and who obtained such limb . under the acts of 1879 and 1881.

Quite a quantity of other work was dis i posed of, but very little of it was of genera . interest. t WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7. t In the House.?The Child's proliibitioi bill came up for a second reading. After t ' long discussion, further consideration wai postponed until 8:30 p. m. At 8:30 p. m i the discussion was taken up again.

The house was not at all dis! posed to pass it. The few friends of the bill I explained that all they asked was the di; vorce that Christ had granted. There was i not a great deal of discussion. The bill was j indefinitely postponed by a vote of 7S to .'M i The York delegation voted against the bill , unanimously. j Mr. Wolf moved to amend the joint reso! lution to extend the time for the payment | of taxes to January 1, by inserting February 1.

The prohibition question came up again in I the evening, and after discussion was again l postponed. i Mr. Duncan's bill to repeal the anti-free * - pass law came up and was killed by a vote ' 1 of 55 to 47. : In the Senate.?Senator Finley intro- : t duced a bill to amend the act preventing the < county commissioners from granting aid to ] " the outside poor, except under certain con- 1 - ditions. It was referred to the committee - on finance. 1 2 A joint resolution to appropriate the sura i 1 of $800 for the completion of the Confeder- i ate rolls having passed both houses, was i sent to the governor for his signature. c The following hill met with a determined < > opposition, hut was passed to its third read itig after considerable debate: "To repeal 1 2 an act entitled an act to provide for the ap; pointment of county hoards of physicians to i examine the diplomas of physicians and i surgeons in this State," approved December < 5 24th, 1890, and to establish in lieu thereof a 1 f State examining board, and to define the ; duties and powers thereof. r Senator Finley's salary reduction bill came [ up again. It's "friends" continued to fight . it by offering innumerable amendments. One i amendment providing that the pay pi sena- 1 . tors and members of the house remain at , . $5 instead of $4, as provided in the bill, was j 5 passed. The discussion was finally discon- , i tinued to bo taken up at 12 o'clock P'riday. ! 1 FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9. , s In the House.?The first business of the , i house was the reconsideration of Mr. Dun- ; s can's bill to repeal the anti-free pass law. ( 3 The motion to reconsider was passed by , - the same vote by which the bill had been ( 3 killed?55 to 47. Several members spoke in 1 favor of the repeal of the act, and several , i. against it. When the question came to a vote, the act was repealed?59 to 47. Messrs. Carroll, Elder and Love voted to | retain the law as it is, and Mr. Wilborn e voted for the repeal. So far as the house is concerned, the members are now in a po sition to receive free passes. B On motion of Mr. Carroll, a bill to reduce , the salary of school commissioner, was reconsidered. The bill provides that the ,- school commissioner shall receive only $3 a r day for days on which he is actually employed, and that the number of days shall i. not exceed one hundred in any one year. , 3 An effort was made to kill the bill, but it , i. proved unsuccessful. On motion of repre. sentatives, a number of counties were ex- , - empted from its provisions. As passed by f the house, its provisions apply to York. Tho 1 ftw if it hernmes such, will tro into ef f feet November 1,1893. e A joint resolution to require an election t for the abolition of the office of school com missioner, was passed by a vote of 93 to 10. 3 The following message relating to the - refunding of the State debt was received i from the governor: 1 "Gentlemen of the General Assembly: - The refunding of the Brown consols, which p fall due July next, is the most important , b question with which the State government - has to deal at this time. As you know, our - predecessors in office provided for the issue - of a 4 per cent, bond to be exchanged for s the 6 per cent., but up to the end of the fiscal year, October 31,1892, only $33,726 of b 4's have been issued under this act, and our b efforts to place the new bonds in New York l at a satisfactory price failed. It is not hard ; . to give the reasons for this, and show what f acts of the State government in the past, - and what men and interests at this time, are - in combination to prevent the State placing ( her bonds at that rate of interest. Suf- < i fice it to say that it cannot be done, and we . must meet the emergency which has arisen ( f by such action as will maintain our crecm - and build it up till South Carolina can bor3 row money at as low rate as any of her , .sister States. s "The State could have placed the bonds at , par in spite of the errors of the past had her own capitalists lent their aid; we can place 1 them at four and a half without their help if , s the general assembly will provide a sinking - fund with which to begin the gradual annual payment of the debt and mortgage the phosi phate beds as collateral. ; "After a careful consideration of the mat ter, in consultation with the state treasurer i and the chairman of the finance committees 3 of both houses, a bill has been prepared, 1 which I submit herewith, that will enable us 1 to meet our obligations at maturity, and so ; build up our credit as to refund the debt in twenty years at as low rate as any State e can obtain. "The practical result of this scheme will 1 be: f "1st. That the interest charges to be met . annually will be eighty thousand dollars less, - but this sum will not go to the reduction of - taxes, but nearly all of it to the payment 2 aud reduction of the debt itself. , "2d. That this will, in my judgment, en1 able us in twenty years to float a three or t three and a half bond, so that in the long , - run the total amount saved the State will be - more than if we now placed a forty-five year 1 4 per cent. bond. "As the bill itself will explain the whole , - in detail, and the reasons must appear to any , intelligent mind, I submit it to you without 1 further argument or comment and urge its j - passage as early as possible." , t The bill consists of fifteen sections, and is 2 rather too lengthy for reproduction here, j 3 It provides for the refunding of the debt at , 4A per cent, interest. As an inducement to i - local investors, the bonds are exempted from 1 - State, county and municipal taxes. The bill j i was ordered printed. At the night session, the prohibition bill j - came up again as a special order. It was ' 1 discussed at length, and finally a vote was taken on the motion to substitute Perry's i bill to refer the matter back to the people. j i The motion was killed by a vote of 71 to 40. ; i All the members of the York delegation i 3 voted against the motion. 1 When the house adjourned at about 11 < . o'clock, the status of the prohibibition bill > 3 had not been materially changed. < i In the Senate.?Senator Sanders intro- j ; duced a bill to abolish all laws relating to . attorney's costs. < Representative Whitmire's joint resolution j to extend the time for the payment of taxes ] > until the loth of January, was, on the motion I of Senator Smythe, concurred in. < II The senate refused to concur in t he house . > ! resolution fixing an appropriation for Clem- , son college at $40,000.

ABOUT COTTON. An Acknowledged Authority Gives Some Interesting Estimates. The following review of the cotten situation has been prepared for the Southern Associated Press by Alfred B. Sheperson, editor of Cotton Facts, and an acknowledged authority on matters pertaining to cotton : The present cotton crop was grown upon an acreage materially less than the previous crop, and upon soil exhausted by the enormous yields of two successive years. The department of agriculture estimated the reduction in acreages as 1GJ per cent., and official and reliable private advices convince me that the department estimate is substantially correct. The reduction in the use of fertilizers was 35 to 40 per cent. The crop was backward, and on October 15 was generally fifteen to fifty days later than last year. Killing frosts were quite general from October 26, and caused a loss of 300,000 bales or more. In the Memphis district alone it has been stated that 150,000 hales were destroyed by frosts. Advices from official and trustworthy private sources leave no room for douht that the vield ner acre is very much less than last season. The most unfavorable accounts from merchants, who are in closest touch with the planters, have recently been received from prominent planters throughout the South, and they fully confirm the reports of reduced yield which come from other sources. In many sections the crop is turning out to be much less than was expected a month or so ago. As the gathering of the crop progresses and approaches completion, its shortage becomes more apparent. Up to this time last year, the tendency of merchants and planters was to underestimate the crop. This year the general tendency has been exactly in the other direction, and there has been an increasing disposition to reduce estimates. I make the commercial crop of this season about 6,500,000 bales. This would be 2,518,000 bales less than the crop of last season. From present indications I would regard 6,500,000 as the maximum of the crop, and it may fall considerably short of this. The present average is about what it was in 188485, and the commercial crop of that season was 5,706,000 bales. Now for price. For two seasons very low prices ruled, lower than most men have ever seen. They were caused by the pressure of the enormous stocks in the world resulting from our two immense crops of 1890-91 and 1891-92. On September 1, middling uplands cotton was worth here 7jc. On the 24th of September it advanced to 7jjc; and it continued to advance until 10 cents was reached on November 25th. There has since been a recession of }c. This great advance of nearly 3 cents was due largely to the purchase of futures by merchants and capitalists as a speculation. Prices heretofore have been unduly depressed by the large stocks of cotton in all cotton centres, but the small crop coming in will have the effect to restore 3tocks to their usual proportions. While there will, of course, be fluctuations, I do not think prices will again reach the low figures of the past two seasons, but that about the present prices will be maintained. I think they are warranted by the statistical i 1 iL position and Dy traae conamons. At me beginning of the season the visible supply of cotton in the world was 950,000 more than the previous year. It is now 105,000 bales less than last year. This change of over 1,000,000 bales in the position has worked a wonderful change in the views of many peoplo in regard to the value of cotton. 

MERE MENTION. Senator Chandler proposes to introduce a bill to prohibit foreign immigration during the year 1893, with a view of keeping out the cholera. A man named Embry, who lived near Lincoln, Ala., stumped his toe while walking along the public road one day last week, and falling down, broke his neck. In the Alabama legislature last week, a bill was favorably reported that imposes a fine of $25 for each and every offense, on any one selling cigarettes. The smoking of cigarettes in any public place is also prohibited Jay Gould's body was interred nt the fnmilv mausoleum on Tuesdav kW*VV? MV V-V *V ? of last week, and a temporary guard was placed on duty to keep thieves from carrying it off. The office of the Philadelphia Public Ledger, owned by George W. Childs, was partially destroyed by fire on Tuesday of lq|t week. The loss is about $200,000, covered by $240,000 insurance. A serious epidemic of typho-malarial fever is epidemic in St. Louis. John White was hanged at Meridian, Miss., last Wednesday, for the murder of James Logan. On the scaffold he confessed to having committed two other murders. The firm of L. & N. Wilczinski, which has been doing the largest banking and general merchandise business in the Mississippi valley, and which was located at Greenville, Miss., failed last Tuesday for several million dollars. The cause of the failure was the short cotton crop in the lower valley. William C. Sawyers, a French Creole, under arrest at New Orleans for burglary, has confessed complicity in the murder of the late Chief of Police Hennessey, on account of whom the Italians were lynched in the New Orleans jail. He says the murder was committed under the luspices of a secret society. A terrible cyclone swept through Eggnog valley, Texas, last Wednesday, and destroyed a great deal Df property. No lives were lost. A bill bas been introduced in the Georgia legislature prohibiting the employment of locomotive firemen not able to read and write. Postmaster General Wannamaker has issued in order, to go in effect January 1, 1893, relucing the fee for each piece of registered mail matter from 10 cents to 8 cents. Sixteen naval cadets at Annapolis, were placed on the United States steamer Santee, last week, for insubordination. Among them was Cadet James, of South Carolina. A recent decision in the United States supreme j court gives North Carolina about half a milion dollars for hack taxes. The orignal charter of the Wilmington and Weldon rail-1 way exempted it from taxes. The State j nought suit and won. The great cot-! :on mill strike in Lancashire, England, hasj lot yet been settled. A strike among i lie telegraph operators of* the Rook Island i ailroad system, went into effect last Thurs-; lay. The main object of the strike is to] force the railroad people to officially rccoglize the order of Railway Telegraphers. ] Several thousand telegraph operators are j ifleeted by the.strike. Joe Goddard and Peter Malier fought a finish fight for a purse )1' S7,r>00 in tlic ring of tiie Loney lsianu Athletic club, last Thursday. Ooddard whiplied Mahcr in three rounds. The Henew convention is in session at Washington, md both the house and senate were opened kvith prayer by Jewish rabbis last Thurs-j lay.

The Atlanta and West 1'oint 'ailroad recently gave notice of a proposed 1 eduction in the wages of its engineers. The ' Migineers opposed the reduction, and Chief Arthur was called on to look into the matter. \ As the result of the conference with the j diief, the railroad has decided not to insist m the reduction. There were 700! tenths from cholera in one district in Russia ast week. M. Pasteur, the great French scientist, will be 70 years old on December 17. He will receive numerous costly presets from scientific men throughout the j vorld. The total visible supply of cot-, on for the world is -1,192,(53.'} bales, of which | 1,821,333 are American, against 1.297.721: md UK},331 respectively last year. The: eceipts of cotton this week at all interior, owns are 196,897 bales; receipts from plan-j at ions 291,737; crop in sight 3,994,437, >alcs; a decrease in amount in sight as com-j tared with last year, of 1.472,037 bales, t is still considered likely that Kdward' durphy will get the vacant seat in the .'nited States senate from New York.

Weber, the new pastor of ] Trinity M. E. church, arrived in Yorkville last Wednesday, and with his family, has ] taken up quarters in the parsonage. He was "pounded" by his congregation last Wed- j nesday and Thursday nights, and preached ] his first sermon in the church at this place , on Sunday. Dr. Weber is generally conce- ; ded to be one of the ablest men in the South 1 Carolina conference. He is a genial, pleas- , ant spoken gentleman, friendly with everybody, and just such a man as the people of Yorkville will heartily welcome in their midst. The congregation of Trinity church is especially to be congratulated in having : secured his services. i THE TAX TIME EXTENDED. , After all, the time for the payment of tax- , es has been extended. As has been pub- j lishcd, a concurrent resolution to that effect , was introduced in the legislature some ten | days or more ago. The resolution did not j seem to meet with a great deal of favor, and j many thought it would be killed. With an j amendment, fixing the time at January 15, it : finally went through. After it was passed j it was discovered that through a slight er- | ror it was null and void. Instead of a con- j current resolution, it should have been a j joint one. There was not sufficient time in , which to correct the error before the 15th, ] and Governor Tillman has helped the legis- , lature out of the dilemma by taking the ] responsibility upon himself. On Saturday | he made following statement to tne repre- ] sentatives of the press for publication : , "Recognizing the wish of the general as- ( sembly to have the time for the payment of < taxes extended, I have advised the comp- ] troller general to extend the time to January | 1; but I consider the public wellfare will be ] jeopardized if it goes beyond that time." < The governor has full authority in this matter, and his assurance given above can i be taken as absolutely correct. It indicates also that he will disregard any request from the legislature to extend the time further than the time specified. NOW FOR A FIRE-ENGINE. < Acting under instructions of the public 5 meeting held in Yorkville, shortly after 1 the recent fire, Mr. G. W. S. Hart drew 1 up a bill under which, if it becomes a law, 1 the town can provide itself with reasonable 1 protection against fire. The bill was intro- 1 1 J aL- MfAolr Kir Sonotnr I J QUC60 111 lilt; btiiuic iuou k/j iwvumvv. Finley, and so far as we know, there is nothing to obstruct its passage. Its provisions are 1 as follows: ' Sec. 1. That the town council of the Town j of Yorkville, in this State, be, and they are hereby, authorized to proceed under section 1 12 of tlie charter of the said town to effect a j loan and issue corporate bonds for the purpose (hereby declared to be a corporate pur- 1 pose, within the meaning of those words as used in the said section of the said charter) of purchasing for the said town a steam fire- j engine, hose, hose-reels, and the other apparatus incident to fire-engines, and for con- f structing water-tanks in the streets of said town, and to proceed under said section to j make provision for the payment of the loan I * so effected, principal and interest. Sec. 2. That this act shall take effect im-1 j mediately upon its approval. After the passage of the bill, it will become \ t necessary for the town council to decide on j j the amount of money to be borrowed, and j then to hold an election by the qualified j voters of the town, in order that they might i decide whether or not they are willing to i borrow the desired amount. i THK ANTI-OPTIOX DILL. The anti-option bill, introduced to pre- * vent speculation in cotton futures, and | which, having already passed the house of | rnnresentatives. is now pending in the sen ate, is being watched with no little interest j by cotton producers and cotton consumers a everywhere. To say that the bill has any t strong advocates in this section would not be c exactly correct. Neither has it any posi- I tive opponents. Very few people have a satisfactory conviction of its probable effect, v and those who have thought most about it, are much more confused on the subject than j those who have not thought about it at all. t Speaking of the matter yesterday, a Yorkvillc cotton buyer said : "The only good that is likely to be accomplished is to shut off the small gamblers and make them hunt some other place to bet their money. The large t speculators, or gamblers, if you want to call them such, will simply transfer their operations to Liverpool; and even if the law ja might otherwise be a benefit to the producers ? of cotton, in the turn that matters will take, jj they will get no benefit whatever. The . law, in my judgment, if it passes, will not " materially aflcct the present status of the i cotton market." .v Another buyer says: "The history of the market for the past two weeks rather leads me to believe that the anti-option law would s be a good one. Pinning their faith to the 11 correctness of the (5,500,000 bale estimates, i b Southern speculators loaded up heavily with <s' cotton. On an average, they were not able M to put up more than two margins. The " Northern men were aware of this fact, and 1 having plenty of money, forced the market b down and squeezed them out. This was the Sl cause of the recent heavy drop, and as the b result, if the truth could he known, I believe ; the South, during the past two weeks, has tl lost not less than $10,000,000 on cotton. r: "In my judgment, if the option law will 1 p prevent speculation to any considerable ex- {tl ent in the South, it will be a good thing, p ["he South usually speculates honestly on c .ctual conditions, but the Northern men ( lave the most money, and can generally r reeze them out. I don't believe the bill is t alculated to help the Southern producer, tut it is bound to be a good thing for the [ Southern speculator. It will keep him from t ;ambling at a game in which the chances c ire about two to one against him." t A 

DISTRESSING CASE. J Frances Fewell, colored, who has been ^ iving in the tenement house opposite the j esidence of Mr. W. M. Kennedy, died last j Sunday night of diphtheria, leaving a hus- j >and and five children. The husband and a >ldest boy, as well as a colored woman who las been serving as a nurse, are now down vith the same disease. None of them are . ixpected to live. There are three other :hildren in the house, and the family is in a ? itate of absolute helplessness. A subscription was started last night for the purpose of jroyiding for the needs of the unfortunate . victims. Dr. George Walker is in attend- . ince. He admits that the case is a desperate . >ne so far as the inmates of the house is loncerued, but says there is no possible dan- ? * i - /? -1 t ;er ot an epiaemic, ana no cause ior murui.

Leander Parish, who lives just without the incorporate limits of Yorkville, a little more thin a mile from the court house, was destroyed by fire last Monday night. The fire waa discov ered at half-past 9 o'clock Deiore ltnaa maue any considerable headway, but owing to the lack of a sufficient supply of water, it could not be extinguished. The gin had been running during the day, but not since 5 o'clock in .the afternoon. The fire originated in the cotton press, fully eighty feet | from the engine, and Mr. Parish has good ' reason to believe that it was the work of an , incendiary. His belief is strengthened by 1 the fact that his son, Mr. Brooks Parish, had , made a thorough examination of the premises, less than an hour before the fire was ! discovered. There is not sufficient proof, 1 however, to convict tho supposed incendiary, 1 and at present no steps will betaken against 1 him. Nothing was saved from the burning building except a quantity of bagging, the belting from the machinery and some plow , stocks. The total loss, iucluding eight bales cf cotton, is estimated at $1,200, with no in- J surance. This is the second gin house that Mr. Parish has had burned within the past . Sve years. In the first fire he lost his gin bouse, engine, wagons, buggies and eight- ' ;en bales of cotton, the total worth $2,000. As in the present case there was no insur- ' ince.' | THE

Filled up with the most improved machinery, all the modern conveniences, and as neat and clean \n a new pin, it is no wonder that the mill should be the pride of the whole community. From the best information to be had, the mill is making money.

At present it is working on a big >rder from Fort Mill, and the management las under consideration several large orders, my one of which would keep the mill busy 'or mouths. Of course it wound not be fair Jto say too much about the business of the company, but hose who are interested in such matters nay rely on the following: The company >egan operations originally with a subscrip,ion capital of $30,000, payable on the installment plan in four years, at the rate of >0 cents a share a week.

It is said that the Chester and Lenoir Harrow Gauge railroad pays better, in proportion, than any other line in the Richmond md Danville system. Then why this big 'eduction of expenses and accommodations A o such serious inconvenience to the patrons )f the road ? Easy enough. The Richmond tnd Danville people are trying to put on ots of style with their Washington vestijuled^rwn. These trains do not pay expenses, and the earnings of the more modest *oads are drawn upon to make up thewdefiriency. The poor Narrow Gauge suffers worse than any. It is being literally bled to leath. In their efforts to squeeze every poslible dollar from it, the management is so mpairing its earning capacity that in less :han six months more it will not be able to pay its expenses. Indeed, there is a sore leed for an untamed and untamable railroad jomraission. 

BUCK HILL HAPPENINGS. What Santa Ciaus is Doing?The Suburb of * Ebeuezer? Re-organizatlon of the Fire Department?A City Hospital?A Shooting Scrape?Other Hatters. > f, Correspondence of the Yorkvllle Enquirer. Rock Hill, December 13.?it we neeaea my reminder that Christmas will soon be here, we would certainly get it from the fact that a number of our merchants are making ,K ei most tempting display of holiday goods. The little folks of Rock Hill have every prospect of a merry Christmas if "Santa Claus" has any money led when he reaches this latitude. In a recent drive which your correspondent took through Ebenezer, he was struck with the signs of growth and improvement in this quiet little hamlet. The residence of Mr. John A. Shurley has been put in good repair and repainted ; the appearance of the academy has been greatly improved and its comfort added to by the neat new blinds recently put up; and Mr. A. A. Barron's large new residence, which he is now occupying, would be an ornamental feature to any of our large towns. Rock Hill is growing in the direction'of Ebenezer, and if the latter < will only reach out a little way to meet us, we hope yet to claim it as our "northern suburb." At a meeting of our fire department on Monday night of last week, the committee previously appointed to reorganize the department made a report, recomending that the existing department be disbanded, and that there should be a re-organization with the following members: A. H. White, president; S. T. Frew, engineer; W. B. Kerr, Ed Simpson, Paul Harrison, R. T. Fewell, J. F. Reid, W. J. Capps, W. C. Hutchison, J. C. Sandifer, J. A. Black, R. P. Boyd, J. F. Doby, W. H. Wylie, W. A. Hayes, U. C. Partlow. This report was adopted. The town council had already adopted a recommendation, in view of this reorganization, according to the provisions of which the members are each to receive $25, and the engineer $60 per year. They are also exempted from street tax. The first monthly parade and practice of the new department took place last Thursday afternoon, and some alarm was excited among persons on the outskirts of I Lie lUWLi, wuu ucaiu IUE ivuuug VI vu< trusty steamer, the ''Marion Jones," and had nut learned that a monthly practice was required under the new order of things. .N On last Wednesday evening, at the resilence of the bride's father, Miss Ella Fudge itnd Mr. Thomas Balfour were uuited in the holy bonds of wedlock. The bride is a native of Rock Hill, being the daughter of Mr. H. W. Fudge, and the groom is now in the employ of the Rock Hill Buggy company, being a carriage painter of recognized ibility. The ceremony was performed by Rev. W. A. Pearson. Drs. Crawford aud Strait have recently purchased the house and lot on Hamptou itreet, formerly occupied by Mr. E. S. Campsell, and will use it as a hospital. The muse has been remodeled aud newly painted, and we learn that a matron has jeen secured to take charge of it. Mr. James A. Gill and family will leave Rock Hill this week for Decatur, Texas, ind they will be joined here by a party from Lewis's Turnout, bound for the same place. Mr. Gill has already lived in Texas two fears, having come back to South Carolina >nly a year ago ; so this present move is not nerely an experiment with him. A shooting scrape occurred among some legroes who work on the material train last Saturday night, in which one man received wo slight wounds in the leg. The party vho did the shooting surrendered himself to Captain Sharpe soon afterwards, and has lince been released, Captain Wooten going >n his bond. Rev. E. O. Watson and family left for Benlettsville last week, and his successor, Mr. iVightman, brought his family to Rock Hill ast Wednesday. The ladies of the congregation had assembled at the parsonage to Hive their new pastor a warm welcome, and lis own heart and the hearts of his family vere cheered aud gladdened by the many nbstantial tokens of kindness and good will vith which the larder had been abundantly upplied.
