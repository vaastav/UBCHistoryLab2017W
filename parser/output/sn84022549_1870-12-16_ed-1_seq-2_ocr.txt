rite Jalfe 8imw, BELLOWS FALLS, DEC. IS), 1870 Senator MoCrcary of Kentucky is anxious to return all confiscated proper ty lost bj rebels during the war, and of . course wants more. or Joss of the taxes, paid by tbe people, used for that pur pose, and tbe other day offered a resolu- . tion looking in this direction. Senator Edmunds of this State promptly object ed and the resolution was laid over. We . trust the day is still far distant when the people' money is to be used to pay rebel losses -aad thus virtually offer and pay a premium for rebellion. The President's Message. We gave a summary .of the message lagl week. That .portion relating to the sheries attracts perhaps most attention . and interest, particularly iu England, and we give it entire as follows : THE 

FISHERIES QUESTION. The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward -the .fishermen of the . United Stated during the past season has not been marked by a frieudly feel ing. By the first article of the conven tion of 1818 between Great Britain and the United States, it was agreed the in habitants of the United States should .have forever, in common with British subject?, the right of taking fish in the waters which are therein defined. In the waters not included in the limits named in the convention "within three miles of parts of the British coast" it has been the custom for many years to give to intrudiug fishermen,of the Unit ed Stater a reasonable warning of their violation of the technical right of Great Britain. The imperial government is understood to have delegated the whole or ashare of its jurisdiction or control of these iu-shore fisheries' grounds to the -colonial authority known as the Do minion of Canada ; and this semi inde pendent but irresponsible agent has ex ercised its -delegated powers in an un friendly way. Vessels have been seized (without notice or warning, in violation of the custom previously prevailing, and have been taken into the Colonial ports, their voyages broken up aud their ves sels condemned. There is reason to be lieve that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the Unit ed States, with a view to political effect upon this government The statutes of the Dominion of Can ada assume a still broader and more un tenable jurisdiction over tbe vessels of the United State. They authorize of ficers or persons to bring vessels hover ing within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of Canada Into port, to search the cargo, to examiae the master under oath, to change the cargo and voyage, and to inr flict upon him a heavy pecuniary penal ty if the true answers are not given ; and if such a vessel is found preparing to fish within three marine miles of any such coasts, bays, creeks or harbors, with out a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they provide that the ves sel, with her tackle &c, &., shall be for feited. It is not known that any condem nations have been made under this stat ute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to take such steps as may be nec essary to protect the rights of the citi zens of the United States. It has been claimed by Her Majesty's officer that the fishing vessels of the United States have no right to enter the open ports of the lintish possessions in North Ameri ca except for tbe purpose of shelter and repairing damages, of purchasing wood and obtaining water ; that they have no right to enter attheBritish custom house or to trade there except for tbe purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart within twenty-four hours after a notice to leave. It is not known that any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying the United States flag has been made under this claim. So far as the claim is founded on an alleged construction of the convention of 1818, it cannot be ac quiesced in by the United States. It is Loped that it will not be insisted upon by Her Majesty's government During the conferences which preceded the ne goliation of the convention of 1818. the British commissioners proposed express ly toexclude the fishermen of the Uuited State from the privileges of carrying on trade with any of Ilia Britannic Majes ty's subject residing within the limits assigned for their use, and also that it should not be lawful for the vessel of tbe United States engaged in the said fishery to have on board any foods, wares or merchandise whatever, except such as might be necessary for the prosecution of their voyage to and from said fishing grounds, and any vessel of the United States which shall contravene this regu lation may.be seized, condemned and confiscated with her cargo. This pro position, which is identical with the construction now put upon the language of the convention, was emphati ally re jected by tbe American commissioner, vq4 thereupon was abandoned by the British plenipotentiary, and Article 1, as it stand in the convention, was sub stituted, If, however, it be said that this claim is founded on provincial, or colonial statute, and not upon the con vention, thia government cannot but re gard it as unfriendly, and in contraven tion of the spirit, if not of the Jetter, of the treaty, for the faithful execution of which the imperial government is alone responsible. Anticipating that au attempt may possible be made by the Cauadiun au thorities In the oorning season to repeat their uuneighborly acts toward our fish ermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to suspend by proclamation the operation of tho laws authorizing the transit of goods, wares and merchandise in bond across the teri- tory of the Uuited States and Canada ; and further, should such an extreme measure be necessary, to suspend the op eration of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of Canada are permit ted to enter the waters of the United States. A like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the purt of Canada in tbe maintainancc of a claim to the right to exclude the citizens of the Uuited States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence This river constitutes a naval outlet to the ocean for eight states, with an aggre gate population of about 17,600,000 in habitants and an aggregate tonnage of 6,611,367 tons upon the waters which discbarge into it. The foreign commerce of our ports on these waters is open to British competition, and tbe major part of it is done in British bottoms. If the American seamen be excluded from this national avenue to the ocean, the mo nopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with tho Atlantic would be in foreign hands, their vessels on transat lantic voyages having an access to our lake ports, which would be deuied to American vessels in similar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its justice. During the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay un questionably demonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the Congress of Vienna, in opening te Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judgement of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of that country through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that rivertoand into the sea, even though the territory of another power. This right does not exclude the coequal right of the sovereign possessing the territory through which the river debouches into the sea to make such regulations rela tive to the police of the navigation as may be'reasnnably neccssarv. But these regu'ations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should not impose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right of transit It has been found in practice more ad vantageous to arrange these regulations by mutual agreement, and the United Stales are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the police of the St. Lawrence which may be suggested by Great Britain. If the claim made by Clay was just when the population of the states bor dering on the shores of the lakes was on ly 3,400,000, to it now derives greater force and equity from the increased pop ulation, wealth, production and tonnage of the states on the Canadian frontiers. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our right, the principle for which he contended has been frequently and by various nations, recognized by law and treaty, and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Maycnce in 1831, the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first navigable to the sea. By the convention between Spain and Portugal, concluded in 1835, tbe navigation of the Douro throughout its whole extent was made free for the subjects of both crowns. In 1853 the Argentine Confederation by treaty then opened the free navigation of the Para guay and Uruguay to the merchant ves sels of all nations. In 1856 the Crimean war closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigation of the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia, by treaty declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, in accordance with fixed princi pies of national law, as highways or channels opened by nature for the com merce of all nations. In 1859 the Para guay was made free by treaty, and in December, 1866, tho Emperor of Brazil. oy imperial decree, declarrd tbeAmazon ... - to be open to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The greatest living British authority on this subject, while assenting to 'the abstract right of the British claims, says : "It seems difficult to deny that Great Brit ain miy ground the refusal upon strict law, but it is equally difficult to deny first, that iu so (Joins she exercises hard ly ac extreme and hard law: secondly, that her conduct with respect to the nav igation of the St Lawrence is in plnrinn- uu uiscreaiiaoie inconsistency with W 1 t. ... , . o conduct with respect to the navigation of i.u0 Mississippi, on me ground that he possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took iu rise. Sh insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume o it waters on the ground that she num. se both bank, of the St. Lawrence where it disemborgue iUelf into the sea She denies to the United Sute the richi of navigation, though about one-half of the water of the Lake Ontario, Erie, Huron and Superior, and the whole of the Lake Michigan, through which the river flow are the property of the Unit ed States. The whole nation is infernal. ed in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural slates of the West i tbe Atlantic seaboard. To the citizen. of those states it secures a greater return for their labor. To the inhabitants of tbe seaboard it affords cheaper food. To the nation an increase in the annual sur plus of wealth. It is hoped that the Govcrnmeut of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which her Can adian provinces havo urged her adho-rence. Look Out for Tlictn. About this time Postmasters may ex pect to receive circulars offering them most tempting inducements to "get up clubs " of subscribers for bogus maga zines and newspapers. Promi-cs of tne most lavish kind will bo made to them of " prizes" and " premiums " in the shapo of sewing machines, watches, cash etc., etc., for procuring subscribers to publca tions which either never have, nor will have, any actual existence, or of which only one two or copies will be printed. Last year hundreds of postmasters were placed in a most unpleasant and morti fying position by leading an ear to the seductive tale told by the publishers of the " People s Home Journal," w ho is sued a circular offering a premium worth $30 for $15 in subscriptions; and the consequence has been that the unlucky subscribers, having received two or three numbers of the paper, have "gone for" the postmasters in a way that must after a few months, have become monotonous, to say the least of it. We warn all postmasters to pay no at tention to any circulars or ad veniremen U offering them extraordinary inducements to get up clubs for any publication until they have assured themselves that such publications are well established, respect able concern. Any of our subscribers may be in doubt in such a matier can. ascertain the facts by inquiring of the editor ol this paper, inclosing a three cent stamp and an addressed envelope for reply. Look out also, both now and at all times for circulars offering cash and other articles to postmasters who will furnish lists of names of farmers, storekeepers, and others. These circulars are all is sued in the interest of swindleri, who use the names thus furnished in addressing their "confidential" letters off counter feit money and bogus lottery tickets and prizes. No postmaster should pay any attention to such request! uuless he wants to help cheat and demoralize his neigh bors. United States Mail. Jews in Rome Set Fkee. By a re cent decree of Victor Emanuel, all c ti zeus of the annexed Roman provinces are plcaed on the same footing as regards civil rights. Four thousadd eight hun dred Jews huddled together iu the Ghet to, and who, until a few years ago, were forcibly penned up there by huge iron gates being closed at nightfall, and rieith- ingeess or egress permitted by the guard until the following rooming, are thus emancipated. Up to the present time, though many disabilities were removed, their testimony was not considered as a valid in any of law, so that a Cbristain who killed a Jew in the presence of twenty Jewish witness es remained unpunished for wantof proof. They could not possess real property, a disqualification which unhappily existed too long in countries more enlightened, They were debarred from all the liberal professions, from attendance on the pub lie schools and academies the only ex. ception in their favor being the permis sion to attend the medical lectures at the University. They are now restored to all the rights of other citizens of Rome. The Nursery. The Nurserv for .Tin uary, 1871, is already on our table and is a gem as usual, for the youngest read ers. Its illustrations are nice, and nu merous, and still further improvements are promised for '1871, and the well kuown enterprise of its publisher's is sufficient guarantee that the promise will be fulfilled.

Mr. Sumner has probably the most elegantly furnished house in Washington, facing Lafayette square, and backed up by that excellent hotel, the Arliugton, Paintings, titatuary, engravings, books, and bric-a-brac abound above and below, and, if the Senator keeps on, his collection will rival that at the Hotel deCluoy. Then there is a choice collection of autographs, which contains many specimens no) to be found elsewhere on this continent. It is espec ially rich iu the autographs of sovereigns and of statesmen, but, its gems aro fine specimens of John Milton and of Drydcn. It is a desire to have funds for the pur chase of such objects of art that has sent Mr. Sumner on a peregrination through the West of late, lecturing every week day night, and passing most of the days on the rail. When at home, no oue there is more hospitable, or has a better cook than the Massachusetts statesman. Hon. Jons P. Hale. Remembering the earnest and successful labors of the Hon. Joha P. Hale, in the early days of the anti-slavery cause, we cau but read with sadness the following, from N. II. Patriot, relative to this early cham pion of b u man freedom : " Hon. John P. ILite may bo seen upon the streets of Dover any fair day, walking slowly and painfully with the aid of a cane. His whole right side is paralysed, but not completely. In walk ing be drags his right foot, tbe difficulty seeming to be mainly in and below the ankle. In opening a door he ia obliged to use his left hand, chitnging h is cane to the right. Intellectually Mr. Hale is vigorous, but thinks he is somewhat im paired in memory. The rotund, rosy man of yore is no more, for Mr. Hale is but the ghost of his former self. His hair is well silvered, and, altogether, no former acquaintance would recognize the man, without some clce to his iden tity other than that presented by his ap pearance." A Joke on a Judge. Tbe Worces ter (Mass.) Gazette jays that legal cir cles thereabouts are greatly enjoying an occuranceat the recent term of the Su perior Court, at Fitchburg, at which Judge presided. As is usual at the opening of a term, a clergyman waspres cnt and opened the session with prayer, in the course of which, after asking Di vine favor and guidauce for tbe presid ing Judge, he proceeded to earnestly im plore the Lord for similar blessings up on the Judge's wife and children, that they might be spared iu life and in health during his absence, and that, at the close of the term, he might be ouce more restored to the bosom of bis fami ly. As the presiding Judge was never married, his feelings and those of the counsel, who knew it, may be imagin ed. Brown's Bronchial Troches are widely known as an admirable remedy for Bronchitis JHoarseness, Coughs, and other troubles of the throat and lungs. They are of great value for the purposes for which thy are designed, and it should be known that while they are pleasantly efficacious, they contain no hurtful in grcdienU, but may at all times be used with perfect safety.

X be German women make use of the post to send all sorU of presents to their husbands, sons, and sweethearts. As letters are permitted np to six teen ounces in weight, they enclose cigars, chocolate, tea and slippers. A pair of these last are sent in two letters. It is said that one woman sent her hus- oana a nannel shirt in six pieces, and by six posts. The last letter contained the left sleeve, with needles and thread for sewing the shirt together. Two ladies were talkingabout thespar- rows, and their usefulness in riddintr the city of the canker-worms which used to be such a nuisance. Oue said that the noisy chirping of the sparrows early in the morning, when she wanted to sleep, was as great an evil as the worms. The other lady disagreed, Just then a een- tlemau came in, and he was appealed to : " Mr. A., which do you think the worst sparrows or worms ?" He answered : " I don't know ; I never had sparrows."
