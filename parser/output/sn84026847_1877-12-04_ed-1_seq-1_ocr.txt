IL i ERIE K.tlLKOAD. We had a pleasant call, yeeterday, from John P. Mack, Esq., the editor of the Sandusky Register, and Mr. Juki. Wixib, tne tint President and the most ses'oui promoter ot the Wheeling and bake Erie Railroad Mr. Mack informs us that a new interest in the building of thii road is being developed ,o sandusky and along the upper rid ot .he route, and be feels a 1 air degree of confidence that this important enterprise will yet be completed, connecting the Nail City more intimately with the city of fish and lumber. The road ass been completed and is now in operation between Sorwaik and Huron on the ' lake, a distance of some 15 miles. Subscriptions Lave been made, and the first instalment has been called for, lor the I building of the eleven mile link between I Milan and Sandusky. On this side of Norwaik, a large amount of granding has been done, and but little work wiil be required to finish j between 30 and 40 miles of the road j After that is done, Mr. Wood informg us, tbe management have assurances that they can marfcet their bonds in sufficient quantities to complete the whole line. Some embarrassment has come to the enterprise through the mismanagement ul the contractor, Mr. wlllaolf, but the directory hope soon to boIvp these difficulties and move along to an early and lU'vessul completion of the road. I rUK l?Kl..MDi:.M 'JS> n j Tnis morning wo print the full text j ?(the first annual message o( l'n-sident Haves, which wa3 transmitted to Congress yesterday alteraoon. It is a plain, business-like document, and presents a mir.-or of th? condition of the country ' at home and iU of relations with foreign ' powers. We bave carefully headed up 1 the subjects treated in it so as to make it i qu te easy for the reader to catch at a glance the whole contents of the docu menu. In the opening of his message, the President cut *r? at once upon a discuslion of his Southern policy, which h- jusf ifl? upon the ground of both expediency and constitutionality. Be believes his course has been fully justified by the re lulls. Peace La- smi.ed upon the South em tftate.-; political murders have ' cea^d; the mat-rial " ndition of the county ha* 1*?r jnij.ioved; credit has1 grown better and t u prostrate industries are in,pi v }'e declares his detern, i nination U> continue straight-forward in the course he has b?en pursuing. He shows equal firmness in treating of the i ivil se: vice question, lie maintains 1 his right to make selections of officers made appointive under the Constitution, reeegniisa the duty of the Senate to adviie and consent or reject his appoinI teei, and the privilege of the House to investigate aDd impeach. He makes no allusion to the differences existing between the Kxecutive and the Senate, but his language shows plainly enough that he has no idea of being the party that "backs down." Cpon the question of specie resumption te is very positive. The extract from his message upon this question which was printed in Saturday's Rbois- j r*a, proves to have been genuine, as we then believed. He considers the resump- j lion of specie payments as of the utmost importance, and as essential to both the ' development of our trade and the exten won of our foreign commerce. He intimates that no legislation which would ! retard or postpone resumption will receive his approval. He think? that any : such legislation, instead of relieving the | country lrom embarrassment and die 1 tress, would but aggravate existing die- 1 trust, aud result in material disaster and national dishonor. He maintains that a postponement ot resumption would have an injurious eflect upon all classes, but more especially would it injure the laborlag masses. He opposes the remonetization of silver, except in limited quantities; nsr would he make silver a lull legal tender lie would give it the quality of the pres i sat subsidiary coin, or national bank notes. He would make it good enough for the people, but not fit for the bondholder. He would thus erect the latter into & favored class, and give them in- i '-srests ditlerent from the interests of the ' mass of their fellow men. On foreign topics, tho questions relates to the Mexican border are given the , aost prominence. The condition of af- 1 * rs on the Rio Grande, shown by "fecial reports, is briefly reviewed, and ; l&e reasons which caused the order to be j sued to General Okd are stated. The President appears to appreciate the delicate position in which the government has been placed by issuing that order, and evidently is oonscious that It possibly j s may lead to serious international difficulties; but he dofonds it on the ground that the lives and property of the border citizens could not be mih protected in any otlior way, and disavows any intention or desire to provoking hostilities with Mexico. From this app portion ot tho message it will appear ' and that the administration is determined i upon a vigorous foreign policy, one which will not seek difficulties with oth- ! torn er rations, and which will be ready to Uni accept the consequences of anv act necessary for the protection ol the rights or Mil property of American citizens. W. Secretary :Shkhman, in his report, docs not a?K for any additional legisla- (;ou tion to enable him to execute the resump- day, tion act, aDd the President, in his pon< 2D C message, agrees witn the Secretary. If ol[j( Congress was disposed to fav?r resump- wbi lion, some additional laws might be day, asked for, but, under the circumstances, ' i sessi the President and Secretary both think con, none should be, and they will stand by -p the act of January 1, 1879. Att? The Secretary also maintains the re- Vtu , . . der sumption act does not require the can- l0 C( collation ot the $300,000,000 United in T States notes which remain after the acy t fa 0 greenback currency has been reduced to gjuD that maximum, and it may be left in cir- m p culation, always changeable at the Sub- v'rl1 Treasuries for gold coin. ? DOW Aflairs of the War, .Navy, and Post- 8^rU) office departments receive brief menti n. mitt The recommendations of the cbiel ol departmenta are generally approved. W n In treating of the subjects which come />ug! under the Interior Department, special prominence is given the Indian question. ^ The President insists that good Jaith Satu should be preserved with the Indians. folic He is very emphatic upon this point. The first step toward civilizing the ! Indians recommended is by the dis- . J Sen i couragement of hunting, allowing fr(,n them only a small supply of ol (J arms and ammunition, and persuading j^10 tbern to exchange their ponies for j,^*. cattle. This the President thinks will don. destroy or keep in check their warlike ^ 1o' spirit. As last as the Indians abandon aL:d banting, the President believes they Crati should be collected upon a smaller num- Mat ber ot reservations and taught agricul- ^ lure and herding, and in teaching them peQ peaceful pursuits their natural tastes Cha should be considered, and those who pro- ^?,w OgW term! cattle raising to farming should be yyir permitted to choose tbeir occupation. It is jecommended that the jurisdiction (jrn) of the United Statei Court be extended on r to prottTt tho Indians, and that an mot Indian police, cxmposeL of Indians, be j establish d.

Y MORNING, DEC PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE III* Honlbrrn Policy Civil .Service Reform ?Keinonetizi lion of Silver?Foreign Relntioi ?Border Knidn, <ic. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and Hoase Representatives: With devout gratitude to the boun' ul Giver of ail Good, I congratulate yc that at the beginning of your first reg lar session you find our country bleas< with health and peace and abundai harveete, and with encouraging prospec A an early return of general pro?perit Southern Policy. To complete and make permanent tl pacification of the country continues 5e, and until it is Sully accomplishe nust remain the most important of ? lational interests. The earnest purpoi )f good citizens generally to unite the iflorla in this enduavor is evident fro ,he decided expression in the resolutioi tnnounccd in 1870, in the National Ooi rention of the leading political partie >f the country. There was a wide-spreo ipprehension that the momentous r iults of our progress as a nation, marki )y the recent amendments to the cot utution, were in imminent jeoparu; hut the good understanding whie >rompted tneir adoption in the interei >f a loyal devotion to the general wcllar night prove a barren truce, and the tw ections of the country, once engaged i livil strife, might be again as widel evered and disunited as they were wiie arraigned in arms against each othe Cae course to be pursued, which in in udgment seemed the wisest in the prei nee of this emergency, was plainly in iicaiod in my inaugural address 1 minted to the time which all our poop! lesired to see, when a genuine love t >ur whole country and of all Lha onqerns its true wellaro shall sup ilant the destructive forces of mi, u&l animosity of races and sections lostihtv. Opinions have diflered widel s to the measures best calculated to s< uro this great end. This was to be o ected. The measures adopted by the a l mnistralion have been subjected to s< ere aad varied criticisms. Any cuurs whatever which might have been en ered upon would certainly have encoun ered distrust and opposition. Thes aeasures were, in my judgment, such a leremostin carmony with the con6ti ution, and with the genius of our pec le, and best adapted, under all circum Lances, to attain tne end. In view o he beneficent results already apparent , proves that these endeavors are not t e regarded as a mere experiment, an, u?tain and encourage U6 in our ?tlort heady made. In the brief time whicl as elapsed, tho immediate eflectivenesi o less than the justice of tho cours ursued, is demonstrated, and 1 have ai biding faith that time will furnish it mple vindication in the minds of a grea aajority of my le.low citizens. The dis ontinuance of the use of the army foi be purpose ot upaolding local govern rents in two Status of the Union, wa o less a constitutional duty, and equirement under the circumstance xisling at the time, than it was a mud eedod measure for the restoration o Deal self-government, and the promc ion of harmony. Tne withdrawal of thi roops from such an employment wa fleeted deliberately, and with soliciliou aro for the peace and good order o ociety, and the protection ot the prop rty and persons, and every right of al lasses ot citizons. Tne results tbs ave followed are, indeed, signifi snt and encouraging. Ail apprehen ion of danger irom remitting thos dates to lccal self-government is die ielted, and a most satisfactory chang n the minds ot tho people has begui nd is in urotiress. In every part of tba oction of tho country, once the theatr I unhappy strife, subsisting on suspicior listrust and aversion, we seo concord riendsbip and patriotic attach nent to the Union. >'0 unprejudiced aind will deny that the terrible arc tten fatal collisions which for sever a oars have been of frequent oocurrenci nd have agitated and alarmed the publi aind, have almost entirely ceased am hat a spirit of mutual forbearance am early national interest has succeeded ?nere has been a general re establish nent of order and ot the orderly admin itration of justice; instarcesot remain ng lawlessness have become of ran ccurrence; political turmoil and turbu Bhce have disappeared; useful industn as been resumed; public credit in thi louthern States has been greatly strength ned, and the encouraging benefits of 1 evival of commerce between the section f tho country lately omoroiled in civi var, are fully enjoyed. Such are some 0 he results already attained, upon whicl he country is to be congratulated. The; re ot such importance that wo may witi ontldence patiently await the desirt* onsummation that will surely com jiLh the natural oroeress of events. I any not be improper here to say that i hould be our fixed and unalterable de ermination lo protect, by ail availabl nd proper means under the ccnstitutioi nd the iawg, the lately emancipated rac n the enjoyment of their rights an irivileges, and I urge upon those V kliooi heretofore the colored people bav uslainod the relation oi bondsmen th visdom and justice of humane and Ik ral local legislation with respect to tbei ducation and general w-eltare. A fire ,dherence to the laws, both r.alioral an itate, as to the civii and political right if the colored people, now advanced t ull and equal citizenship; the immediat epression and sure punishment by to lationai and local authorities w'thi heir respective jurisdiction* ol every it lance of lawlessness and violence towa: hem, is required for the security alike ( ?th races, and is justly demanded by th )ublic opinion of the country and t! ige. In this way tne restoration of ha; nony and good will and the con piece protection of every citizen i ,he full enjoyment ot every constitutioi il right will surely bo attained. \\*Da jver authority rests with me to thi- en I shall rot hesitate to put forth. WCa aver belongs to the power of Congre and the jurisdiction of the court# ot ti Union, they may confidently be re.i< upon to provide and perform, and to tl legislatures, the court# and the executr authorities o: the several States, I ear estly appeal to secure, by adequate, a propriate and seasonable m< >ns witn tneir border#, the common a ; uniior rights of a united peop^ wni;h lov liberty, aDborea oppretS'on a A rever justice, fhose objects are v-ry d6ar my heart, and I shall conti ,u- moeteaeatly to # rive for their attainoii-nt. T cordial co-operation of all eliu-es of t sections of the country and ui ooth rac is required for this purpose, and wi these blessings assured, and sot oth< wise, we may safely hope to band do< cur free institutions of the governme unimpaired to the generations that w succeed us. EMBER 4,1877 n | Kesnniptiou of Specie Faymeuti. ^ Among: the other subjects ot great &nc general importance to tne people cf tfcii countrv, I cannot be mistaken, I think in regarding as pre-eminent the polict and measures which are designed to securi *' the restoration of the currency to th* normal and healthful condition it 1 which, by the resumption ot specie pay monts, our internal trade and foreigr ?/ commerce may be brought into harmo ny with the system of exchanges whict is based upon the precious metals as tht )U intrinsic money of the world. In th< u. public judgment that this end should bt sought anil compassed as speedily anc ^ securely as the resources of the peopli la 1 and the wisdom of their government car v 1 accomplish it, there is a mu^h greater do "' groe of unanimity than is found to concui in thespecilic measures which will brine 30 the country to this desired end. A? to th< 1l) rapidity ot tho steps by which it .an b( I satelv reached, upon a most anxious and ,;j deliberate examination, which 1 have 8,3 felt it my duty to give to the subject, i jr am but tue more confirmed in tne opinm ion which I expressed in accepting the 4 nomination tor the I'rc dency, and again upon my inauguration, that the u poliey of resumptiuu snoull be pursued i by every suitable means and tbai no t?

I lainmentcf that res It. 1 have no dis^ | position, and certainly no right, to que* h ! lion the sincerity or the ioteliegence of | tUUOC UUiUlil^ SliU 0 would neither conceal nor undervalue the 0 considerableditficultiea and even oceasionn at depressions which may attend tho pr<>.. gross of the nation towardo this primary n condition to its general and permanent r prosperity. 1 must, however, adhere to .. my mo6t earnest conviction that any wavering in purpose or in steadiness in the methods, so far trotn avoiding or reducing tho inconvenience inseparable e ironi mo transition irom an irrvu' iiii,t ble to a redeemable paper currency, 1 would only tend to increase and prolong the disturbance in values, and unlet a re[. trievei must end in serious disorder, dishonor and disaster in the tlnany cial allairs o! the government and ot . the people. Tho mischiels which 1 ap. prehond and urgently deprecate are con[. lined to no class ot tlio people iudo?d, but aeom to me most certainly to threaten e the industrious masses whether their . occupations aro ol skilled or ot common j_ labor, so tnat it seems to mo it is of prune 0 importance that their labor should be 8 compensated in money in itselt tlxed and . exchangeable in valuo by being irrevo* ably measured by the labor necessary to i. its production. This appreciation ot ,[ the quality ot tho money ol the people in sought ior and can only be gained by the resumption of specie payments. The j rich, tho speculators, the operating, the money doaling classes may not always h feel the'mischiefs or may lind casual 1 prohts in a variable currency, but the e misfortunes of such a currency to those j who are paid saiaiio? or wages are iu3 calculable. I itrHilJiikliiisat of tho t oiiiajfc sjstsni, Closely connected with this general r subject of tho resumption of specie payments is one o! a subordinate, but 8 s.ill of grave importance. 1 refer to tho tt readjustment ot our rroinago system by 8 the renewal ol tho silver dollar as an h elemont in our specie currency, en' dowed by legiolation with the quality ol '* legal tender, to a greater or loss extent. B As there is no doubt of the power ol * Congress under tho constituliou to coin 8 money and regulate the value thereof, '' and as this power covers the whole range of authority applicable to the ' raetai, the rated value and the 1 'gal teudea 1 quality which shall bo adopted for the coinage, tho considerations which should induce or discourage a particular measure e connected with the coinage belong 1 cleariy to the province of legite lative discretion and ot public a expediency. Without intruding on thi? 1 province of legislation in the least, 1 p nave yet thought the subject of such ' critical importance, in the actual condi'< tion of our i.ffairif, a.- to present an occa' sion lor the exercise ol the duty imposed d by the constitution on the President ol ^ recommecuing to the consideration ol Congress such measures as bo snail judge '? necessary a'd expedient. Holding tlio c opinion, ha I do, that neither toe interests of the government nor of the people of the United Stales would bo promoted ' by disparaging silver, us one of the two * precious ii etals which furnish the coin" age ol the world, and that legislation * which Iuokj to maintaining the volume 9 of intrinsic money o> tu> full a measure of * both metals as tb' i- relative cjmmercial f values will permit, Would be n?- tber un* just or inexpedient, I must ask your " indulgence to a brief and definite stale. 3 ment of certain essential features. In 3 any such legislative measures which I ' feel it my duty to recommend I do n't propose to enter the debate repr t nted J | on both sides t?y such ablo d.sput&nta in F | Congress and before the j,... iple and in 3 the press a1 t'> the extent to which the , legislation of any one nation can control e this question, even within its own bor1 i ders, against tne unwritten :aws of trade 1 I or the positive laws ol olhor govern" ; ments. The wjkIoui of Cone ' grese in shaping any particular law n that may be presented lor my e approval, mav wb ily supercede tbe ne^ | cecity of my entering in-o tbese consid0 orations, and 1 willingly avoid either e vague or intricate inquiries.
