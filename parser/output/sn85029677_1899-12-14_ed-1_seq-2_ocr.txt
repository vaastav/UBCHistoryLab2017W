Otherwise so many states 'would have offered her one that her position might have become very em barrassing'. Recently the prince of "Wales com pleted his fifty-eighth year. His royal highness has attained a greater age as prince of Wales than any of his prede cessors, and has also borne the 'title longer than any other person, having been created prince of Wales when one month old. Near a station in Utah a car loaded with powder was blown up while in transit. The force of explosjon was so lreat that it tore up 90 feet of track. It shook the whole freight jtrain and broke glass in the engine cap windows and caboose. The fragments of the powder car and two adjoining cars took fire and burned up. I Physicians say that there is no per Boh who can retain his or her nobility of character under long continued bod ily distress. The argument that some invalids and cripples have beautiful dispositions does not apply j for the rea son that although such persons imagine themselves in constant pain, there are Teally long intervrls of relief and qui etude. I Kinsey Feathers is the name of the tollgate keeper on the Frederick turn pike, one mile below Ellictt City, Md. He has been there for 16 j years, every day at his post of duty except Fourth of July and Christinas in ach year. It is asserted he has never jslept in a bed in all that time, but madaged to catch naps sttting in a chair, ready to come at a moment's notice to collect his toll and let the traveler pass f-hrough. According to the annual report of the state board of health, the improved sanitation of Massachusetts results in the saving of over 5,000 lives every year from all causes, and a large part of this saving is due to anti-toxin. Of the cases of diphtheria, two-thirds are treated with anti-toxin, and the fatal ity in the cases treated with this remedy was only 10.7 per cent., while the fatality in the preantitoxin period was 2S. 3. It is rather amusing to find the two republics of South Africa, with a com bined white population of less than 800,000, issuing proclamations annex ing sections of the British colonies and changing the names of towns in Natal and Cape Colony in honor of Boer lead ers. The sensation is a novel one for the British empire, which is accustomed to take the lead in the annexation busi ness, and not to have its own geogra phy disturbed in the least. A get-rich-quick operator calling herself Mrs. Kate Bradford worked up a big business in Brooklyn in 1S94 by offering to pay interest on deposits at the rate of from 50 to 240 per cent, a year. When 5200,000 ahead of the game of paying dividends from deposits she disappeared and has never been heard from since. One man lost $93,000, but Mrs. Bradford was not above small re turns, for she absorbed all her cook's wages except $1 a week. Another cherished theme of the col lege orator and essay writer the swift extinction of the American Indian receives a shock when studied in the light of statistics, the figures in the case coming from the annual report of the secretary of the interior. Accord ing to that document there are now 267,417 Indians in the United States, while the census of 1S90 showed a to tal aboriginal population of 249,473. "Poor Lo" has evidently taken a fresh grip on life and calmly and with ex ceeding stubbornness refuses to "pass away with the buffalo." The designer of the battleship Ore gon predicts that within a few years steel ships 1,000 feet long will be built for the Pacific trade. But he says the advance will be gained by gradual in creases, because it will take time to calculate the effect of strain on hulls. A long hull rests variously on the series of waves, and there is also a side roll, all of which makes it difficult to secure the right rigidity without practical ex periments. The advantage of long ships is the greater carrying capacity and the fact that the cost of the crew Is no more than on a smaller vessel. W. T. Harris, commissioner of edu cation, presents some statistics of a gratifying character. They show that the aggregate enrollment in the com mon schools for 1S97-'9S exceeds that of the previous year by 890,841. The grand total of all schools, elementary, secondary, and higher, public and pri- vate, was 16,6S7,643, which is' an in crease for the year of 432,550. A little more than one-fifth of the entire popu lation is therefore enrolled in school. - The average amount of schooling per individual is five years of 200 days each. Some states average seven years, while fiome fall as low as 2-. A MINING ACCIDENT. An Awful Explosion in a Mine at Carbonado, Wash. THIRTY-TWO MEN LOSE THEIR LIVES A Searching; Investigation to Be Made Into the Cause of the Calamity Forty Four Men Rescued Oat of the Seventy-Six. Carbonado, Wash., Dec 11. An ex plosion took place in shaft No. 7 of the Carbon hills mines, 40 miles east of Tacoma, just before noon Saturday. Thirty-two is the number of. dead. As by a miracle two men were rescued at five o'clock yesterday morning after suffering an awful night entombed in the dark cavernous chambers of hor rors. Almost mocking the doleful situation, one of the men, Peter Merp, proudly slapped himself on the breast as he was emerging from the mouth of the main tunnel, ejaculating: "Peter's all right; how's my dogs?" In painful contrast to him was the other unfortunate, named Michael Knish, a Pole. So sickened had he been with the dead air, laden with its black-damp, that he could hardly find his voice and what utterances he did give vent to, were born of delirium. Later in the day Knish said: "I was working on the fourth cross cut when it came. After that I went to sleep and somebody came and woke me up and took me out of there." That was the tell-tale measure of his period of consciousness. All he knew was that an explosion had happened and then he fell asleep until rescued. He had lain in the cool depth over 18 hours and had not the least conception of this length of time. On the other hand, Peter, the Frenchman, had been blindly groping around in the darkness for the most part of the night on his hands and knees seeking for some avenue of escape. The injured numbered six, all of whom are severely burned. Gov. Rogers will conduct a searching examination as to the cause of the ex plosion. He telegraphed State Mine Inspector Owens, now at Spokane, to attend the inquest to-day and examine witnesses himself. The question of in efficient ventilation of the mine in ac cordance with the state law will be thoroughly gone into. It has been found impossible to secure an impartial coroner's jury in the mining districts and Coroner Hoskel has gone to Tacoma and will select his jurors there. The theory of Superintendent Davies is that a small pocket of gas was opened and became ignited. The concussion of the gas explosion caused the terrific explosion of dust which caused the damage and loss of life. The total number of men in the un fortunate shaft was 76, of whom 44 are alive, all of them having escaped or been rescued. THE BRITISH-BOER WAR. Genu Gatacre Meets with a Serious Defeat Near Stormberg Renewed Fighting: at Modder River Natives Rising. London, Dec 11. It is hardly too much to regard Gen. Gatacre's repulse near Stormberg as the most serious de feat British arms have yet sustained in the whole campaign. Already the official advices show that two men were killed, nine officers and 17 men were wounded and nine officers and 596 men are missing. But it is evident that the worst is not yet known. The proportion of wounded and killed is so small when compared with the missing who are undoubtedly prisoners in the hands of the Boers that the sup plementary list of casualties is awaited with serious misgivings. The disclo sure of such a strong force at Storm berg was quite unexpected. Doubtless Gen. Gatacre was the victim of treach erous guides. But the result points also to the absence of proper cavalry scouting. The British troops who recently oc cupied Arundel are advancing. They had several skirmishes, but no casual ties. Three miles north of Arundel they found the Boers 3,000 strong. The British reports of renewed fight ing at Modder river originated from the fact that the British with a team -of oxen hauled a naval gun to the top of a high ridge north of Modder river town, whence they fired lyddite shells on the Boer - position, at a range of 6,700 yards, where the 'enemy was ap parently constructing an emplacement for a40-pounder. The lyddite shells ap peared to do much damaged. The Boers retired, but the incident is interesting as showing that the Boers are still in position quite close to Modder river. Kimberley reports all quiet there up to December 7 and that the pressure of the investment is diminished. A dispatch from Cape Town to the Daily Mail, dated Thursday, December 7, says: "News that Chiefs Khama, Linchwe, Bathoen and Secheli, with their people in Bechuanaland, have risen to attack the Boers seriously com plicates the situation. It is probable that the Basutos and other tribes will follow their example." Three Boys Drowned While Skating:. Altoona, Pa., Dec 11. Ralph and Clyde Hendricks brothers, aged IS and 11, and Albert Shilling, aged 14, while skating at Gallitzin yesterday broke through the ice and were drowned. Man and Wife Lose Their Lives. Philadelphia, Dec 11. A fire at Gloucester yesterday destroyed the Green Tree hotel and stables and the Clifton house. David Young, a laborer, and his wife Bessie, both about 60 years of age, who lived at the Clifton house, lost their lives. Tha. loss is 525,000. Gov. Bradley, of Kentucky, last night replied to the criticisms of the state board of election commissioners about his calling out the militia and defended his course in ordering them out at th election, DOINGS OF CONGRESS.

COMMERCIAL SITUATION. Holiday Demand Has Opened Well Cereals Strong Iron and Steel Qaiet Quieter Demand for Wool. New York, Dec. 9. Bradstreet's to day says: The last month of the year has opened aus piciously, finding trade and industry generally well employed, demand treading close upon and even passing supply, labor troubles averted in 3ome instances by widespread advances in wages, of small importance except in one or two cases, and with the general level of values of staples at the highest point reached for eight years past Holiday demand has opened well and collections from retail trade therefore show some improvement The strength of cereals, notably wheat, this week, is a reflection largely of decreased re seipts at the northwest Increases in Novem ber business were not as large, either in this country or abroad, as they were a year ago, and to this extent the outlook is less bearish and, owing to the smaller world's production this year, hopes of well-maintained prices have not been abandoned. Cotton has lost most of the notable strength aisplayed in past weeks, owing chiefly to a por tion of the speculative element becoming tired and selling freely on slightly increased receipts. Toward the close strength was noticed on im proved foreign buying and the net change for the week is not serious. After a year of unpre cedented activity and advancing prices, iron and steel are quiet, with few significant changes, partly because the season of the year does not favor new work, and partly also owing to the fact that the producers are very general ly sold up to the middle of next year. Prices show no marked change. The strength of wool is apparently unimpaired, though demand is quieter. London prices have again moved high er and the small available supply of fine grades supports the belief that prices still move up ward. The granting of a ten per cent, advance at nearly all the large cotton mills throughout New England, which, on the bases of census figures, would point to an increased purchasing power being secured by nearly lO-.'.OOO people. Business failures in the United States for the week number 220, compared with 177 last week, 237 in this week a year ago. 292 in 1897, 381 in 1896 and 313 in 1895. Cuban Negroes Displeased. Santiago de Cuba, Dec. 9. A meeting held at the Antonio Maceo club Thurs day night to celebrate the anniversary of the death of Maceo developed a vio lent patriotic demonstration against the Americans. One prominent colored politician said during the proceedings that the time was nearly ripe for the spirit of free Cuba to leap from the grave of Maceo and to drive the intrud ers from the island. All criticised Pres ident McKinley's Cuban policy. To Investigate Freight Classification. "Washington, Dec 9. The interstate commerce commission yesterday in stituted an investigation in the matter of charges in freight classification and advances in freight rates by carriers using the official classification and fixed the date of hearing for December 21 at Washington. They Hadn't Suffered. Summer boarder Yon shouldn't keep your pigs so near the house. Farmer Why not? "Because it isn't healthy." "Oh, you're mistaken!

FILIPISO TREASURY RECORDS F0U5D Statement Made by Two Spanish Prisoners Ids argents Attack an American Train and Are Defeated Gen. Pilar Killed by Maj. March's Battalion. Manila, Dec 11. An expedition headed by the battleship Oregon left Manila for Subig Saturday night. It is reported that the Filipino command er, ' Gen. Alejandrino, with his staff, has surrendered to Gen. MacArthur and there is also a rumor that Alejan drino is at Aguilar, suffering from a wound received in a fight between in surgents and bandits and that he will be given an opportunity to surrender and will be properly cared for. Maj. Spence, with a column of the Thirty-second regiment, captured a new insurgent camp and uncompleted stronghold in the Tassan district. He left Dinalupan at daybreak Saturday, marched ten miles along mountain trails, finally encountering a large band of insurgents, who retreated after a brief skirmish. The Americans had no losses. The records of the treasury of the so-called Filipino government; together with a quantity of paper money and another Nordenfeldt, have been found at Mang-atarom. Three Americans, who, with a com missary sergeant of the Twelfth infan try, were traveling from San Fernando to Angeles, left their escort for a mo ment and went into the bush. As thev did not return speedily a search was made for them, but they could not be found. They were probably captured by "the rebels. A mail orderly disap peared between Angeles and Bamban. He also is supposed to have been cap tured. Col. Julio del Rio, who is among the released Spaniards that have, just ar rived here, gives an interesting version of the famous Irene incident in Subig bay in July of last year. He was formerly in command of the Spanish troops in the Olongapo district. His narrative is corroborated by Senor Rafael Rosello, a wealthy Spanish mer chant, who also fell into the hands of the insurgents. Both declare that the Spanish surrendered to Capt. Cogh- land, of the cruiser Raleigh, on an express agreement that they were not to be given up to the Filipinos, and they assert that the Spanish govern ment has promised to press their claims against the United States for their imprisonment. A force of 100 insurgents Saturday attacked near Baliuag a wagon train escorted by SO men of the Sixteenth in fantry.- A sharp engagement followed. The Filipinos lost 18 in killed and nine in capture. During the recent attack by the insurgents upon Vigan the Fili pinos obtained possession of the plaza and of the church in the center of the town, from which the Americans dis lodged them. It seems that the es caped Spaniards obtained guns and fought with the Americans against the insurgents. Gen. Gregorio del Pilar, command ing Aguinaldo's bodyguard, was killed by Maj. Peyton Marsh's battalion of the Thirty-third infantry in a fight 18 miles northwest of Cervantes, Decem ber H. BIG FIRE AT AUGUSTA, GA. The Blaze Continued for Four Honrs and Laid Waste a Solid Block in the Bnslnesa Center. Augusta, Ga., Dec 11. A fire which had its origin in a dry goods store here shortly after two o'clock yesterday morning burned four hours and laid waste a solid block in the center of the business portion of the city. The dam age will approximate 51,000,000. There were no casualties. The flames were discovered on the second floor of the big wholesale and retail dry goods store of J. B. White. The Arlington annex and the stores beyond it, all a part of the old Central hotel property, abutted the store of J. B. White on the uptown side and all were involved in the first onslaught of the flames after getting outside of White's big store. Next came the Masonic hall, a hand some three-story building, occupied by offices and lodge rooms. Soon the structure was thoroughly ablaze and it was seen that there was no longer any possibility that the Arlington hotel could be saved. As soon as the fire was discovered the guests of the Arling ton were awakened. There was much excitement in the hoteL All the guests made their escape by the stairways. Many commercial men stopping at the hotel lost hundreds of dollars' worth of samples which they had displayed. The guests, however, managed to save most of their effects. The Kansas City Times Changes Bands. Kansas City, Mo., Dec 11. The Kan sas City Times has been transferred from Wiley O. Cox to a corporation composed of George I Chrisman, pre siding judge of the Jackson (Mo.) county court; John S. Sullivan, a peni tentiary contractor at Jefferson City, and A. A. Lesueur, Missouri's secre tary of state. Capt. Lesueur will have editorial charge. An A. P. A Circular. Washington, Dec 11. The A. P. A.' has followed up its attack last week upon President McKinley and Speaker Henderson with another circular. The circular was received Saturday by every member of the house and senate. It gives a long list of the favors the Cath olic church is alleged to have received from the administration. The Pacific- express office at Chey enne, Wyo., was robbed of between 55,000 to 530,000. The entire office force is under surveillance as there is no clew. - ' A 

RAILROAD PRESIDENT'S SOB Lieat. Iedyard, Who Was Killed In the N tive Police Uprising In Negros, En listed from Yale University. Detroit, Mich., Dec 9. The news oi the death of Lieut. Agustus C. Led yard, who was killed in Kegros, was broken yesterday to his father, Henry B. Ledyard, president of the "Michigan Central railroad, while his father "was en route home from New York. It was decided to send an intimate friend to meet the president's car and endeav or to soften the blow. The lieutenant was Mr. Dedyard's second son. He was at Yale at the outbreak oi the Spanish war and had outlined for himself a railroad career. Joining the patriotic rush of students, he en listed in a New York battery, and spent most of his time, a volunteer in camp life near Tampa. Afterward, at his own and his father's desire, he entered the regular army as second lieutenant. He was a grandson of the famous Gen. Lewis Cass. NOT A 

PARTY QUESTION. Gov. Jones, of Arkansas, Further Eluci dates Upon Bis Recent Declaration in Favor of Expansion. Little Rock, Ark., Dec 9. Gov. Jones' expansion views, as given out two days ago, are still a fruitful source of comment. The chief executive said yesterday: Expansion is not a party issue. It is a ques tion of political economy, of national polity. No one man should be allowed to commit a party to any fixed policy. President McKinley cannot make the republican party the chief ex ponent of expansion, for there are many repub licans opposed to it. It is as much a democratic doctrine as it is republican, notwithstanding the efforts of certain self-styled leaders to deny it to democracy. It is these leaders and not the democratic party who have declared against expansion. Just because the republiban. popu list or any other political party advocates some great principle, is it right that we should take the other side for the sake of contrariness? No. As I have said, I believe the acquisition of th Philippines was fortunate, and that we should retain them at all hazards. THE
