The Legislature, tn the Senate on Ei iilay the Sen ate till to repeal the conventional Interest law wa rejected. A similar bill waa defeated in tUa House. Tho Senate on Saturday disposed of a lot of routine business oflittlc Interest. Ia the Iloust, the Comrottee on Federal IUlationf, to whom waa. re ferred the special message of the Governor in relatiou to the cotton tar, submitted a report unanimous ly concurring in the views of the Governor, accornponied by a reso lution instructing bur Congression al delegation to introduce and sup port auch measures daring the next cession as will cause to be refunded, without delaj-, the tax on cotton collected in the year 1855-6-7; and memorializing Congress to paas the law desired. The resolution was adopted under a suspension of the rules. Mr Spears, from the Committee on Finance, Ways and Means, submitted a report on the bill to repeal the merchants tax, without any recommendation one w.13- or the other. A resolution was adopted authox-iiingthe comptroller to take the necessary steps to meet a loan of $150,000 falling due the present month, either by borrowing money or hypothecating bonds.

We intended to give our readers the President's Message to-day in supplemental form, but it is really too thin. It is not worth tho space it weald occupy. Tho only feature in it worthy of mention ia the fact that he opposes polygamy, recom mends the modification of taxes and the removal of political disa bilities. He is sound on these points, but weak on everything else. Nashville has two of the best daily papers in the. South, or in the North either, if we except a few metropolitan dailies, and we hope the people of Tennessee and of the South will sustain them liberally, rnd not fly off at the handle becau k they have advanced their rates to $10 per anuuni. They are worth every cent of it, and could not sur vive on lt!ss at their present rate of expenditures" The Mac and Coburn Fight- The fight which took place near New Orleans last Fiidaj' between Joe Coburn and Jem Mace, the one a New York bully and the other an imported .bruiser, affords a fair sample of the degeneracy of the prize ring if, indeed, a business that was always as low and vile and disgraceful as it well could be, can properly be said to have degenera ted. After beating and bruising each other ia eleven rounds before a heartless throng, the fight wa3 de clared a draw, doubtless to be re peated at sonic future da'. Waynesboro. Editor Citizen; No doubt every one was surprised this morning on arising to find the ground covered with snow, for the clouds did not look like snowon retiring last night. The snow has already fallen to the depth of tea inches and continues to snow. I saw three or four wagons pass through town this morning loaded with plunder bound for the far West ; rather late in the season to be moving and no doubt they wil suffer with cold before tnev arrive at the end of their journey.

A good book is a good friend." ThU 13 i.3 true not only of books but of periodicals. There is no class of individuals in tho country raore or feomfceh in need of friends of this kind as our "school teachers. "Only here and there is there found a teacher who at all attempts to keep Dace with the science and ert of teaching, for both it is. There are books' and papers' of "aa excellent nature being published which con tain a vast deal of useful informa tion and hints to every teacher. For example, every one " should read Hart's "In the School Room," and should be a regular reader cf some one of the educational publi cations now to be had at reasonable rates. There is too little progress and too much old fogyism in teach ing .nowaday. Ia this, an every- thing else, the word progress is do ing its work,, and our teachers should keep up.. In medicine the practitioner on "the good old p!an" is now left all alone ia - the dark, and so in teaching; the old way is of necessity losing ground. The writer does not advocate tLe entiic dismission of the medicine for boys that grows upon beech trees, for mman nature is the same in all ages, and more especially so with boj-s, but there are innny other changes for the better. Take for instance the question of object teaching.' How many teachers have really a correct idea of what is meant by the expression? In arithmetic, grammar and geogra- PI13- objects drawn upon the board will serve "to illustrate what is aimed to be taught in a way utterly impossible of being attained by any other means. Any one knows that to undertake to give a boy a verbal description of a ship, the idea im pressed will be a vague one. but the picture will enlighten tha little fel low's ndnd completely. So with most subjects taught in our schools: The assertion', in spite of the use and common sense of such teach ing, is made that not one in ten of our ' teachers use these means. This is the natural result of the idea that prevails that teaching is a stand-still science. In this de partment then is just as rapid and pravtical'advance as in any other. There is as much difference in the books used by the children of the present generation and those used by their proud fathers as there is between the stage and the locomo tive, 3-et few teachers seem to ap preciate this fact." The Teacher's Association of our county aims to remedy this evil; hence the ground for asserting th&t evety teacher should become a member of it.

Passing through the arched door-waj' we entered one of these apartments, the so-called re ception room. , This room is finished off in dark tcssalated marble, and is some thir ty five or forty feet long. On the wall hangs a set of "Rules and Reg ulations of the morgue." Behind the glass screen is anothej room of about the same siae and appear - , ance, with the addition tion of four mar-, ble slabs, each abont eight feet long and about t'wentjr-five inches in width, which 'rest on iron stanch ions, and slightly inc'ined towards the glass partition, which, they face, in order that the bodies mii' rest with an elevation of the head and shoulders. - Above these slabes is a .long iron rod, upon which the clothes of the dead arc seen. An iron water-pi pe.runs along the ceil ing, and branches off above each slab into an india rubber tube ter minating into a sprinkler, ' that reaches down near the slab, and from which a steady stream of water i3 made to flow over the corps to save it from putrefaction while on ex hibition. " .. " "; At the hour of our visit onlv two of the slabs were occupied. One a woman, m ine prime oi me, iouuu dead bA- the wayside. Her features had anguish and despair impressed, as with an Iron hand, and we were filled with horror at the suffering the rigid features bore. To -her, death must have brought relief. The other, a voting 'girl with s'nch an appealing look for pitty, for sj'iripaLby,' for love in her cold white face, that a moan escaped u and tears sprang to our eye.?. Her long dark hair, wet with the dripping water, hung in ringlets over the marble slab and one del icate hand rested outside the black oil-cloth which covered the bod'. The few words found upon her per son when lifted from the dark river in which she had pln.ngedtired f the pitiless pain that had wrecked her hopes was the only due to the fatal act; ' .
