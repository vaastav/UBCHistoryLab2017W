Very little business was done at Monday's term of court. Judge Win Chester opened the court at two o'clock p. m. and within three hours the calendar was gone through and an adjournment taken to the next regu lar term. The jurymen were allowed one day's pay and mileage for their presence at the opening, as required by law. In one instance, however, a juryman drawn—L. Eager—was not present, and the court ordered that a bench warrant be served on said jury man for his appearance at the next regular term of court to show cause if any for his non-appearance at this term. Our county commissioners have been diligently trying for some time to get all old delinquent tax matters settled, and in the few cases which were not closed up citations were is sued and the matter came regularly into court. Iu some instances parties appeared and made a settlement or had their case continued until the next term of court and in all cases where there was no appearance or svtilenient, judgment. ineluilim i.t\ and I'IK!S, wa Vilvorlisini rati-» \vill»bc mailt: known onap- .... 7, „. .vii.itns and 11inottiv Uandai, were pi IClltlOll lit lllC ClUCO.

Wamberg, republican, has 25 majority over Burnett, fusionist, and Clark, re publican, has but three majority over Williams, fusionist, Yeager, republican, run about 40 behind his ticket. Johnson, republican, for congress has 6,674 plurality over O'Brien, democrat, and lacks only 760 of having as many votes as both O'Brien and Foss, inde pendent, combined.

We do have some cold days in the Northwest in winter. ut the ones we have iu mind would make the worst, blizzard til l! ever ldcw seem like a tropical sum 111 by comparison. Some few hundred 1 lions.tn or mil lion years ago the whole of Ihitish America and a large part of the I'nit ed States were buried under a sea of ice hundreds of feet thick. The bor der line of his glacier si retched north westerle from the coa.-t of New Jer sey through l'eiiiisj Ivania to Ohio, thence southwesterly through Indiir 11a to a line drawn cas* and west across liiinoi about lil'ty miles south of St. Louis. From thence the line bore away northwesterly into the Mi souri Valley. We know the limit by the granite boulders that were home along in the progress of the glacier, and are not found south of the line described. There was a long succes sion of cold days then, lint as the Northwest was not. inhabited there was no tourist, travel to Ihe resorts of the South. Things have changed. People buy ice now—and in Southern cities they make it. It is a desirable thing. Cold days now make people think of traveling South and in select ii railro id remember that the P.iirling ton Route has its own lines to Chica go and St. Louis, offers choice of routes, ami 111 ikes low rates.

An aci'l which exists in sour milk and cider, called lactic acid.is believed by physicians to be the cause of rheu matism. Accumulating in the blood, it attacks the librous tissues in the joints, and causes agonizing pains. What is needed is a remedy to neu tralize the acid, and to so invigorate the kidneys and liver that all waste will be carried off. Hood's Sarsapa rilla is heartily recommended by many whom it has cured of rheuma tism. It possesses just the desired qualities, and so thoroughly purifies the blood as to prevent occurrence of rheumatic attacks. We suggest a trial of Iloods Sarsaparilla by all who suiter from rheumatism. The Masons have a new organ for their hall. The PKKSS gives news, the litest ami best.
