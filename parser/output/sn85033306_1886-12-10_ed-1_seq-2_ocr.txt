In portraying tlie injustice of our tariff system, so far as the far mers are concerned, he uses the following strong and plain language: "Those actually engaged in and more remotely connected with this kink of work, number nearly one half our population. None labor harder or more continuously than they. N enactment limits their hours of toil and no interposition of the Government enhances, to any great extent, the value of their pro duct, and yet, for many of the neces saries and comluris of life, which the most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes and it.r their implements of husbandry they are obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit, which, by the action of the Government, is tiven to tlie more favored manufacturer."
