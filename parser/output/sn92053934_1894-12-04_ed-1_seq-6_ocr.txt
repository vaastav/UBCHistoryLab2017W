Washington, Doc. S. Tho opening of the second session of the FirtyHhird con rres after a recess of three months nintle the big white Capitol building center of Interest. The house was called to order promptly at nrjoa. At that hour the chamber was well filled. Many of the members' desks were strewn with flowers, as one of the houso wits said: "Flowers for tho living and flowers for tho dea-J." Many of tho floral pieces were large and handsome. Shortly beforo 13 o'clock Rood's towering form was espied as he came down the center aisle, dressed in a conventional black frock coat Instantly the babble of voloes was drowned in a ringing cheer from his party associates. G reelina; to Wilson. The cheer was taken up and echoed by the galleries. Mr. Reed, with radiant face, bowed his acknowledgements. A moment later Representative Wilson of West Virginia entered and the author of the tariff bill was enthusiastically greeted by his associates, tho Democrats respond ing with lip and hand to his appearand!. As the hands of the clock pointed to the hour of 12, Speaker Crisp entered the hall from the lobby and ascended the rostrum. A burst of applause signalized his en trance. With several hard bangs of the gaval, the sjiejiker restored order and the second session of the Fifty-third congress had begun. Quorara In tbe Hoasn. Tho roll-call dt-veloticd tho presence of 216 members, forty-seven more than a quorum. The speaker announced that several members elected to till vacancies occurring by death or resignation were present, nnd George P. Harrison of Ala bama, John S. LiUlo of Arkansas, Will iam L. Henry, Charles K Coffin, and William Lncitl of Maryland, W. M. Ileck ncr of Kentucky, J. H. Bromweli of Ohio, and Michael Onffin were escorted to the bar of tho house and sworn in. The sneaker also nnnouncixl the res? gtiation of Amos J. Cummings of New York, who resigned to iiccept the appointment as subway con ml dinner of New York. Upon motion of Wils.iti a committee, con sisting of himself, ILilman and Keeu, was appointed to join a similar commit tee from tho senate to ini" vm the presi dent that a quorum of Imth houses was present and congress was ready to receive any oommuiiiearion he desired to inuhe. Several other resolutions, fixing tho hour of meeting, etc., were adopted, and at 12:30 the house took a recess until 1 p. m. to await the president's message. At 1 o'clock, the committuc not yet having arrived, another recess until 1:15 was taken. When the committee at last walked down the aisle the house was all attention while Mr.- Wilson announced that the president would communicate his views in writing. At 1 :3i Mr. Pru den, the president's executive clerk ap peared with the message which by the di rection of the speaker was read by the clerk of the house, Mr. Kerr. The reading of the message occupied an hour and forty-five minutes. It was list ened to with carrfnl attention, especially the portions relating to the tariff and the banking scheme, but there was no dem onstration when it was concluded. Sev eral routine reports were presented, after which Scran ton (Rep.) of Pennsylvania announced the death of Myron P. Wright, late a representative from the Fifteenth district of Pennsylvania. Tho usual re solutions were presented and adopted, and then, as a further mark of respect, the house, at 3:20 p. ni., adjourned for the day. In the Senate. In the senate there was a crowd which filled tho galleries without crowding. A new rulo had been put into operation lim iting the reserve galleries to the use of those personally introduced by senators instead tif those holding cards of admis sion. The senators were lntu iu arriving and some of those who had been most con spicuous in recent public events, notably Senator Hill, were absent. The usual dignity and decorum which marks all sen ate proceedings kept the galleries from showing their manifestations of approval which marked the opening of the house session. Sixty. Six Senator Present. The vice president then directed the roll call which developed the presence of sixty six senators, considerably more than a quo rum. The senate then took a recess until 12:30 p. in. and the senators again moved about the chamber exchut-ging greetings. Many of tho senators had received floral tributes, which gave a touch of color among the black garbs. On the desk of Senator White was a tall cluster of red roses and on thr.t of Senator Martin a largo spray of La Franco roses. Messrs. Gorman, Voorhces, Harris, Proctor, Gal lingur, Shoup and Huusbrough were also remembered, with handsome clusters of flowers. The most noticeable floral design was that placed ou tho desk of Senator Smith after the session Iwgan. It repre sented a huge shield of red, white and blue, with "New Jersey" worked in crim son flowers across the face. Senator Brico of Ohio was also tho recipient of flowers after the session opened. At 12 ;80 the sen ate took a further recess until 1 :30. Measage Head la the Senate. On tho reassembling of the senate at 1:90 Harrison and Manderson reported that the president would communicate with the senate by one of his secretaries. Executive Clerk Prudcn immediately ap peared at the maiu door nnd the white haired Isaac Bassett of the senate stff an nounced, "Message from the president." A large document was carried to the vloe president, who directed that tho message bo read. Thereupon Secretary Cox, in measured tones, began reading the docu ment. In the meantime, printed mess ages Iiad been secured by inauy senators, who read the text. Most of them, how ever, paid close attention to the reading. The senate was somewhat more In the humor for business than the house, for after tho message was road George of Mis sississippi offered a resolution for a clo ture rule. Hoar one asking for infor mation regarding the Armenian massa cres, Turpie one for tho election of sena tors by tho popular vote. Lodge for In formation relating to the execution of two Japanese by tho Chinese while the men were under the protection of the United SUtUis, Blunchard a resolution protesting BB4 iwnoMtratlBg against the Armenian "as acres. Peffcr had two, one wanting to know why and under what authority bonds were issued, and the other why troops were sent to Chicago during the strike. A number of annual reports, etc. Were received and the senate adjourned.
