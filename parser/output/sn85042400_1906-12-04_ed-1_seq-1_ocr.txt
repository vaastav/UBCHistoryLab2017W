Ha stated in his opinion, that the governor ( of Colo rado was not required to demand proof beyond that stated in the extradition papers and his failure to do so cannot be regarded as an Infringement of any of the rights of the petitioner. The court said that if the petitioner was not a fugitive from Justice no warrant could have been Issued by the governor of Colorado, and after the Issuing of the warrant, it was competent for a court, federal or state, sitting In Colorado, to inquire whether the petitioner was a fugitive from Jus tice and if he was not to discharge him from custody.

' ' The court concludes by stating that any Investigation Into the motives of the governors of Idaho and Colorado would be Improper as well as irrele vant to the questions to te deter mined. , It must be . presumed that those officers proceeded throughout the affair with n0 evil purpose and with no other motives than 'to enforce the law. , COAL STRIKE ENDED.
