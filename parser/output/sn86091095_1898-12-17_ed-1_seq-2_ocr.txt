The d»tc printed on the wrapper of each pe or denote« the time np to which the •ub«cription Im« been paid. President McKinley intends to visit Cuba and Porto Rico. The plan according to present informa tion, is for the president and party, probably consisting of several cabi net officers and ladies, to start on the trip after the close of the pres ent session of congress. The ashes of Columbus were transferred with military and sacer dotal ceremonies Sunday from the Cathedral at Havana to the Spanish cruiser Conde de Venadito which immediately set sail for Cadiz with the sacred dust of the great discov erer to be interred in Spanish soil. The cruiser was convoyed by two gunboats._ The people of Washington are subscribing to a $10,000 fund for the purchase of a solid silver service for the flag-ship Olympia as a tribute of appreciation for the heroic con duct of Commodore Dewey, his officers and crew during the memo rable engagement in Manila Bay. The service will be tendered as a Christmas present. Governor of Cuba. President McKinley has desig nated Major-General Brooke to be military governor of Cuba. Each of the six provinces will have its own military governor, and will re ceive instructions directly from Brooke. Cleveland on Annexation. Ex-President Cleveland was in terviewed recently on the new policy of the United States and dictated the following for the Associated Press : "Without going at all into details, I wish to say that I am ardently opposed to every feature of this annexation and expansion policy. The public ought to know pretty well what my convictions are, from the Hawaiian question during my ; administration. I have not changed my mind and remain opposed to all of this annexation from Hawaii to the Philippines." Senator Cockrell's Views. Senator Frank Cockrell, of Mis souri, who has as level a head as any man in America, thinks there will be very little new legislation at this session; that the important business accomplished is likely to be confined to the regular appropri ation bills, a river and harbor bill, enough army legislation to meet emergencies, and a bill providing a government for Hawaii. Senator Cockrell is opposed to our taking permanent possession of the Phil ippines, although he fully approves of their being taken away from Spain. He says we should aid the natives to establish an independent government, to be under our pro tection until able to stand alone. Speaking of the political outlook, the Senator said : "The Democrats are not downcast at the result of the election. The heavy Republi can losses show the strength of the Democracy and indicate that the next general election will return the party to power." A school of housekeeping has been established in Boston, and its aim is to provide a school where employers and employes may to gether learn the business of house keeping. Lectures will be given on "How to Build a House," by a san itary engineer and a noted architect. The "Equipment of a House" is described by a practical housekeeper Maria Parloa. Among other lec tures will be "Food in the Relation of True Economics," "Economic Buying," and "Domestic House keeping;" "The House as a Unit of Health;" "Division of Income in Household Expenditure," "Do mestic Service : Its Past, Present, and Future," and "Domestic Service as a Trade." In addition to this there will be demonstrations on "Dust and its Dangers, "Practical Study of the Cellar and Yard," "Heating and Lighting," Ventilation, Drainage, and Plumbing," "The Laundry," '"The Kitchen," "The Storeroom," "Interior Woodwork: Its Prepara tion and Preservation," "The Hy giene of the Bedroom," etc. From what bas already been said it will be seen that the school is a radical departure from the ordinary meth ods in vogue. It is an acknowledg ment that housekeeping is a science and housework a trade—an import ant distinction. The plan proposed for the devel opment of this idea comprises u home, a family, and classes in the ory and practice for housekeeping, for employers, and a course of prac tical training in housework for em ployes. The school is carried on in two connecting houses, well ar ranged for this experiment. One house is occupied by boarders con stituting the "family." The other is used for classes and demonstra tion work for employers and em ployes. These employes receive the training; they carry on the work of the house under the direction of a skilled housekeeper and a cooking teacher. A special course of train ing and housekeeping has been ar ranged so that a limited number of employers may, during a six weeks' residence in the school, learn "to keep house" by practice and obser vation. 

BRYAH CAH TALK FREELY HOW. The Distinguished Democratic Leader Declares Against Expansion. HK SAYS COLONIZATION MEANS DEATH TO THE REPUBLIC. Colonel William J. Bryan upon leaving his command at Öavaunab, Ga., Tuesday, gave out the follow ing statement for the press : "My reason for leaving the army was set forth in my letter to the ad jutant general tendering my resigna tion. Now that the treaty of peace has been concluded, I believe I can be more useful to my country as a civilian than as a soldier." Colonel Bryan then proceeded to the discussion of public questions, saying : "The people of the United States, having rescued Cuba from foreign control, may now resume the dis cussion of the domestic problems which confront this nation and to the consideration of the new ques tions arising out of the war. A NEW DANGER. "I may be in error, but in my judgment, our nation *is in greater danger now than Cuba. Our people defendedCuba against foreign arms, now they must defend themselves and their country against a foreign idea—-the colonial idea of European nations. Heretofore greed has per verted the government and used its instrumental interference for pri vate gain ; but now the very founda . . principles of our government are assaulted. "The imperialistic idea is directly antagonistic to the idea and ideals which have been cherished by the American people ever since the signing of the Declaration of Inde pendence. Oiir nation must give up any intention of entering upon a colonial policy—such as is now pursued by European countries— or it must abandon the principle that governments come up from the people; or we may believe that gov ernments come down to the people, from those who possess the heaviest cannons and the longest ships, but we cannot advocate both doctrines "To borrow a Bible quotation, 'a house divided against itself can not stand,' paraphrasing Lincoln's declaration, I may add that this nation cannot endure half republic and half colony—half free and half vassals. Our form of government, even traditions, our present inter ests and our future welfare, all for bid our entering upon a career of conquest. conquest. "Jefferson has been quoted in sup port of imperialism, but our oppo nents must distinguish between ex pansion in the western hemisphere and expansion that involves us in the quarrel of Europe and the Ori ent. They must still further dis tinguish between expansion which secures contiguous territory for fu ture settlement and expansion, and that which secures us alien races for future subjugation. "Jefferson favored the annexation of necessary contiguous territory on the North American continent, but he was opposed to wars of con quest, and expressly condemned the acquiring of remote territory." 

PROPOSES A CURE. When asked how the colonial policy could be prevented. Colonel Bryan said: "Some think that the fight should be made against ratification of the treaty, but I would prefer another plan. If the treaty is rejected, ne gotiations must be renewed aud instead of settling the question ac cording to our ideas, we must settle it by diplomacy with the possibility of international complications. It will be easier, I think, to end the war at once by ratifying the treaty and then deal with the subject in our own way. The issue can be presented directly by a resolution of congress, declaring the policy of the nation upon this subject. The president in his message says that our only purpose in taking posses siun of Cuba is to establish a stable government and then turn that gov ernment over to the peoyle of Cuba. Congress could reaffirm this pur pose in regard to Cuba and assert the same policy in regard to the Philippines and Porto Rico. Such a resolution would make a clear cut issue between the doctrine of self-government and the doctrine ot imperialism. We should reserve a harbor and coaling station in Porto Rico and the Philippines in return for services rendered, and I think we would be justified in asking the same concession from Cuba. In the case of Porto Rico, where the people have as yet expressed no desire foran independent govern ment, we might with propriety de clare our willingness to annex the island if the citizens desire annexa tion, but the Philippine islands are too far away and their people too different from ours to be annexed to the United States, even if they desired it." u Friars Brutally Treated. The Manila correspondent of the Hongkong Press gives details of the shocking treatment of friars and other prisoners captured by insurgents in the northern part of the island of Luzon. The war de partment has started to work on the release of tue friars in Aguinal do's possession. Tbe stale depart ment refuses to treat with him. Aguinaldo wants $80,(XX) for each friar. They will be tuken by force of arms to make good tbe condi tions of tbe peace treaty. The Red Cross Society has a Rus» siân Countess among its nurses. 

GENERAL HEWS. Many discharged soldiers have been employed in New York shovel ing snow. Miners in the Altin district of Brit ish Columbia are reported working nights by the light of a newly dis covered volcano. The work of painting the war vessels in the Brooklyn navy yard white, the usual color in times of peace, has been begun. General Ruis Rivera, the Cuban general, recently liberated by the Spanish from Ceuta, arrived in the city of New York Monday to join bis family. General Fitzhugh Lee and staff sailed from Savannah Monday for Havana on^he transport "'Panama," one of the first prizes captured in the American-Spanish war. The first United States troops to march through the streets of Ha vana will be the 202d New York regiment which, with band playing and colors flying, will march from San Jose wharf, after landing there from the transport Minnevvaska. through the heart of Havana to the Western railroad station. These troops will be sent to Pinar del Rio province. a Counterfeit Dollars. A recent dispa4«h from Memphis, Tenn., says : A smooth gang of counterfeiters are at work in the Mississippi valley. The counterfeit is of the standard silver dollar and all which have»so far been discov ered bear the date of 1890. It is believed something like 200,000 of them have gained circulation. Xmas Gifts for Volunteers. Last Saturday the Omaha World Herald sent hv telegraph $1,000 to the First Nebraska regiment, lo cated at Manila, and $1,000 to the Third Nebraska regiment com manded by Colonel William J. Bryan, now at Savannah, Ga., pre paring to start for Cuba. This money is contributed at the solicit ation of the World-Herald by over 3,000 contributors, and is sent to the two regiments to provide for a of in regiments a Christmas dinner. Volunteers to be Relieved. The news comes from Washing ton that the war department has begun in earnest the relief of the volunteer troops now stationed at Manila by regulars. Monday after noon Secretary Alger signed an order designating for this purpose six regiments of United States infantry out of the eight held in reserve for service in tropical coun tries. The regiments are the Twen tieth, at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.; the Third, at Fort Snelling, Minn., the Twelfth, at Jefferson Barracks, Mo., and Fort Riley, Kan.; the Seventeenth, at Columbus, O.; the Fourth, at Fort Sheridan, and the Twenty-second at Fort Crook, Neb. They .will go forward to Manila as soon as fhe transport can be pro vided. The volunteers in Manila will be retired in the order in which they reached that city. Bryan Has Resigned. A Washington dispatch of Dec. 12th says : All doubt respecting the intentions of Col. William J. Bryan have been removed by the receipt by the war department of a telegram from him stating that he has mailed the resignation of his commission as colonel of volunteers and that it was approved by the division and corps commanders. The written resignation came to hand at the war department this afternoon by mail and was imme diately accepted, notice of the fact being telegraphed to Colonel Bryan. Colonel Bryan will be given an opportunity to tell of his military experience on his return to Lincoln, Neb. On the 20th of this month the Bryan Traveling Men's club will tender a complimentary ban quet to Bryan and Congressman Bailey of Texas, the latter having accepted an invitation to-be present and speak. If Colonel Bryan finds it impossible to be present at that time a date will be arranged to suit. Death at Manila. A correspondent of the San Fran cisco Call under a recent date furnishes a gloomy account of the mortality of our soldiers and the sanitary conditions at Manila. He said: "There is sickness in the heat of the noonday 6un, there is death in the miasma's of the night. Fever comes with dryness; fever is all that is brought with the rains. One sleeps, eats, walks, drills and passes his whole existence down in this beautiful accursed land, in a continual atmosphere of fever, small-pox and dysentery. The consequence is that every hospital —and there are many—is tilled to overflowing, and the dead march is heard almost as often as the bugle cull. The men are dying at the rate of three a day, and those thaï escape are in danger of being inva lided for life. Death goes merrily on reaping his harvest, and when the olfidtal report of the fatalities is received at home the paeans of .victory, which are now resounding throughout the land, will bechanged to dirges, and the voice of Columbia will be heard mourning for her children and refusing to be forted because they are not." U. S. volunteer soldiers in the late war are by law exempt from their share of required annual assessment work on unpatented mining claims. An affidavit setting forth the facts essential thereto must be filed with the recorder of the county in which the claim is situated before Jan 1, 1399. It of a more com 

TREATY OF PEACE SIGHED. Spaniards Grief Stricken at the Hu miliation They Had to Soffer. The treaty of peace between Spain and the United States was signed last Saturday night by both parties. The United States gets the Philip pines for $20,000,000. Porto Rico also becomes the property of Unde Sam, and the annexation of Cuba will eventually follow. The Span iards are grief stricken and humil iated at being forced to sign the terms proposed by the United States. Spanish PeaceCommissioner Abar zuza, discussing the peace negotia tions, said : "We have fulfilled our mission here aud have agreed to make a treaty of peace, but we do so under protest that our sovereign rights over the Philippines are still iotact. Senor Ojeda, the principal Span ish secretary, said : "Peace is assured. We bave agreed to sign a treaty in accordance with the pro tocol of Washington, but at the same time protesting our sovereign rights over the Philippines and stating that we only yield to the hard American terms owing to our inabiltv to renew the war and in the presence of superior force." The London Times comments as follows on Spain's wail of protest at the harsh treatment of the United States : "Spain has lost her colonies because her colonial system was founded upon spoliation and tyranny. The United States has not treated her any more harshl y than Germany treated France in 1871, or Russia treated Turkey in 1878. Therefore, the Spanisli .memorandum of protest is unreasonable and unjustified."' of Tired of Life Could Not Sleep, Was Nervous, and Had Headaches All These Troubles Completely Cured by Hood's Sarsaparilla. I think it a duty to express my thanks (or the good I have derived from Hood's Sarsaparilla. About a year ago I became perfectly worthless. I could sleep but a few minutes at a time during the whole night, and when I rose in the morning I felt worse than when I went to bed. I « I became very nervous and had sick and dizzy headaches. I was almost tired of life, and did not care for anything. I made up my mind to try Hood's Sar saparilla. I procured a bottle and began taking it.

General Calixto Garcia, the dis guiehed Cuban warrior and leader, and the head of the commission elected by the Cuban assembly to visit this country, died in New York city Sunday at the Hotel Ra leigh, where the commission has its headquarters. The sudden change from the warm climate of Cuba, with the hardships he had there endured, to the wintry weather of New York, was responsible for the pneumonia which resulted in his demise. He contracted a slight cold in New York which did riQt assume an alarming stage until the early part of last week. On Tues day night General Garcia, in com pany with the other members of the commission, attended a dinner given in bis honor by General Miles, and it was exposure there that caused the disease which culminated in his death. In his dying moments, as all through his busy and active life, his thoughts were for his beloved country and its people, and among his last words were irritiunal mui terings in which he gave orders to his son, who is on his staff, for the battle which he supposed was to occur to-morrow and in which he understood there was Spaniards to combat. Just betöre he died he embraced his son.

Last fall Mr. John Sparks slaugh tered one of his tame elks, a small herd of which he has at his ranch up the valley. He shipped the car cass as a present to J. VV. Dorsey, a former Elko attorney but now prac ticing his profession in San Fran cisco. The toothsome meat was received all right by Mr. Dorsey, who toak it to the butcher s shop to have the animal dressed and cut up to distribute among his friends. It happened to be the close season for that species of game in Calior fornia, and any person found in possession of it is amenable to fine and imprisonment, whether it was killed in that state or elsewhere. At all events Mr. Dorsey was arrested, pleaded guilty and paid the usual fine. But that was not the worst of it. The officers of the law refused to deliver the meat to Mr. Dorsey and the entire carcass was sent out to the Alms House, where, it is to be hoped, the unfortunate inmates enjoyed a treat even though it was at the expense of Mr. Sparks and Mr. Dorsey.—Nevada State Journal. of to Application fop as ^tem.
