TAFT'S MESSAGE CHEERED Senator Sutherland Answers Objections to the Conventions. HENRY WATTERSON HEARD Resolutions Adopted by Pennsylvania Conference on International Arbitration. Pfl 11..\ DKLPHIA, nefrniher 14. ?In a great mass meeting: held in the interests of universal peace and the arbitration of all international difficulties many rhiladelphlans and distinguished visitors from all over the state and from many parts of the United States voiced their sentiments against the needless waste and havoc of war last night in the Academy it Music. United States Senator Theodore R. Burton presided# and aroused the en- ? thusiasm of the delegates by his short in- ' troductory speech. , A message from President Taft indors- > ing the meeting and praising the work ' ^f the Pennsylvania Conference on In- , lernational Arbitration, which is holding ts convention here, was read by Senator 1 Burton and received with cheers by the j iudience, who seemed to appreciate the President's great work for International trbitration, the most signllleant and com- ' >rehensive features of which are the new , English and French arbitration treaties vith the United States. Sutherland Indorses Treaties. i Senator George Sutherland of Utah, *i vho made the principal address of tiic j vening. indorsed the peace treaties beween the United States, Rngland and t "Vance, and said that without hesitation "j le would give them his entire support. ^ le said, in part. "We are informed that the Senate is 'j >eing nefariously inveigled into a dele- J ration of its treaty-making power to a ! oint high commission and that we are J n darfger of agreeing to arbitrate some ] [uestions of which we alone should ad- t udge ftnd some which are subject only o the ancient and honorable remedy of * vager by battle. I am not impressed by ^ ither contention, and I shall, without he slightest hesitation, as a member of ; he, committee on foreign relations and is a member of the Senate, vote for the 'j at Ideation of the treaties precisely as *< hey are written. I venture to say, J vith all proper deference to those who j hink otherwise, that the delegation of j he treaty-making power is not in any ^ espect involved. ^ "But we are told that unless we amend ^ he proposed treaties we may be com- < tn n rhitra to tho Mnnrno nnotrinp - ixty-flve years old. In this connection dr. Donnelly's report says: 1 "There are employed in the government 1 minting office more than 1130 persons < ihove the age of sixty-five, and it would >e of advantage to the government to j >rovide for the retirement of those who lave given to the public service the best ' rears of their lives and who may be ; mable to perform an average day's work, j rhls could be equitably accomplished 1 hrough the adoption of a plan which Mould in effect' amount to an annuity to aeh employe upon arriving at the age of etirement or upon becoming disabled. "The basis of such annuities should be ength of service and the saiary or wage , -eceived during their employment, which in the case of those who have been in 1 the service for many years would meet ' their ordinary requirements during the ' remainder of their lives. Such a plan 1 Mould result in saving a large portion jf the amount that it is conceded gener- ' ally is now lost throgh the superannuation of employes, and would at the same ' W,. a 0 4U ^ I.

"1 must not take the time to enter this leld of discussion further than to say hat there does not seem to me to he the illghtest danger of any such contingency. Jnder the terms of the treaties I do not (ee how these questions can be said to be usticiable. and as it will require the content of at least two out of three of our >wn citizens who will be members of the ommission before any such question can >e held justiciable and therefore subject o arbitration, the chance of our being: ailed upon to submit any matter of thl^ and is so remote as to be practically impossible. Neither am I alarmed over the laim that we may be compelled to subnit questions affecting the national tonor." v Appeals to Beason. "It would seem that a measure of pubic benefit such as the arbitration trea:ies negotiated by our government with he governments respectively of England md France would call for little urging jpon intelligent Americans," said Col. Henry Watterson. "In England and in France there is no dissent whatever. But here, owing to the perversity of some and :'ne indifference or ignorance of many, or:anization is required, a campaign of eduation and an appeal to reason. "I grew to manhood under the joekeyng subterfuge for valor known in its Jay as the <-ode of ' honor. it was the >ff spring of unmanly vanity. When real war came, not one of the professional luelists made his mark as a good sol1i*?r " Representative Martin \V.

The resolutions urge on the United " Rates that it approve the proposed trea- J ies without amendment of text or spirit. ) This country is asked in the resolu- 4 ions not only to join in, 'but to take a ^ dace as the leader of the movement ^ ending to have all international questions J iubjectcd to Judicial settlement.
