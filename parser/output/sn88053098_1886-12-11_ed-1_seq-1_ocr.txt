Thursday evening gave a most enchanting expeilenoe on board the steamer Wilming ton. The river from shore to shore was a vast field of ice floes. The the edge of the horizon. Its roseate reflec tions tinted the soene Iu ruddy aud golden earu8cations thrown back from the frozen river. A more novel or delightful pioturr uld not be asked by any lover of nature. Wo habitually eub g ze the pleasures of a river trip iu the balmy evenings of mid summer. But the novelty of this scene, the crushing, crinkling ioe floes, the gorgeous ■ inset, the glorious expause of miles either side, the seasonable contrast of gra> aud wiutry coloring, the invigorating air,the glinting twinkling red lighis on the distant shores peeping one by one from the deopen lug haze as the stout steamer Wilmington pi »ughed aud bumped her passage, made an attraction far excelling the delights of watei travel at any other period of the year, A big ocean steamer, just in from the Atlautic got herself entangled in the large ioe blocks in shore. Two or three brigs also had come to gilef in the same manner. But the bright oabin lights along the dark heavy lines of the big ocean monster inferred no danger or need of sympathy in the temporary deten tion. It was amusing to see how easily the Wil mington guided by the careful piloting of Mr. W. 8. Jackson glided safely.by them all making as good & running as in the summer trips. Captain Bioomsburg is most untiring in his exertions for the oomfort of the guests of the steamer Wilmiugton. Iudeed one ol the pleasures aud novel experiences of the winter trip is, upon steppiug out from the brightly lit and delightfully cosy saloon ol the steamer, to contrast the external wintr> aspect, its star glluting sky and ioy rivtr with the attraoiive surroundings juat left behind. just ot. Wilmington War Medals. Certain soldiers of the Union Army bave received medals in recognition of feats of valor during the War of the Rebellion. The medals aud badges may be divided into two grades, those conferred by corps commanders whose conduct oa geueral officers to soldiers under the personal or special c guidance of their superiors, aud those given by the Uuited States Govern ment. It is uuuessary to add that for some reason or other the latter are muoh more highly prized than the former. There aie holders of both kluds of medals in Wilnnbgton.

The President's message is a most volumin document I for numerous reasons of interest. Mr. Cleveland commences with the sub ject of Chinese Indemnity.

Inasmuch as the »'itutio gives to Con grew the power "to promote the progre 'Cieuoe aud useful arts by securing f.» ed times to authois aud iaveuto liin t »the ex rli ive right to their respective writings and dis coveries," this government did not feel war rauied in becoming a signatory pending the action of Congress upou measures of interna tional copyright now before it, but the rigtu of aduesiou to the Bei ue Convention hereaf ter has been reserved. I trust th» subject will receive at your haudi tne attention it deserves, and that the just claims of auth urgently pressed, will be duly heeded. Speaking upon the re-organization of the Consular Bet vice he asks, iu general ter for better pay for foreign consuls, his aigu >t being that if liiglmr salaries be paid shall get the service abroad of a higher class of publio servants. In regard to the Treasury Report he says I especially direct the attention of Con gress to the recommendations contained in this aud the last preceding report of tho Sec retary, touching the simplification and amendment of the laws relating to the col* leoiion of our revenues, and in the i of economy aud j istice to the government I hope they may be adopted by appropriate legislation. Tho receipts and expenditure account of the government is as follows. Tho ordinary receipts of the government for the fiscal year ended June 30 1836, were $333,439,727,06.
