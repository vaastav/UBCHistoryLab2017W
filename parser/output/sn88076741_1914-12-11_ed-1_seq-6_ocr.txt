The president pointed out that the markets wf'the greater part of the world are empty and that ours is the duty to sup ply the needs not only of the coun fries of Europe, but also of the coun tries which hitherto have looked to If is of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually sup plied with innumerable articles of manufacture and commerce can now get only a small part of what they formerly imported and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets. Here are markets which we must supply, and we must find the means of action. We Need Ships. It is a very practical matter, a mat ter of ways and means. We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them? And if we can made ready what we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it? We are not fully "ready neither have we the means of distribution. We are willing, but we are not fully able. We have the wish to servo and to serve greatly, gener ously but we are not prepared as we should be. We are not ready to mo bilize our resources at once. We are not prepared to use them immediately and at their best, without delay and without waste. To speak plainly we have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted and hindered the development of our merchant marine. And now. when we need ships, we have uot got them. 1 have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistakes and omis sions. The time and the circum stances are extraordinary, and so must our efforts be also. Use and Conservation. Fortunately, two great measures, llnely conceived, the one to unlock, with proper safeguards, the resources of the national domain, the other to encourage the use of the navigable waters outside that domain for the generation of power, have already passed the house of representatives and are ready for immediate consider ation and action by the senate. With the deepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage. 

EMPTY MARKETS TURN TO AMERICA ,Europe Wjll Need Our Help, Says President fn Message to Con gress—Ships Our Greatest Need—New Tasks and Du ties Imposed on United States by the War. Europe for their supplies. The mes sage in part follows: The session upon which you are now entering will be the e'osing session of the Sixty-third congress, a congress, I venture to say, which will long be re membered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it has done, in loyal response to the thought and needs of the coun try. While we have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whole age have been altered by war. What we have done for our own land and our own people we did with the best that was In us, whether of char acter or of intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in the principles upon which we were acting which sustained us at every 3tep of the difficult undertaking but it is done. It has passed from our hands. We face new tasks, have been facing them these six months, must face them in the months to come—face them wi'shout partisan feeling, like men. W&o have forgotten everything but a trnmmon duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great people Whose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herself and to all mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed and •nxious. Europe Will Need Our Help. War has interrupted the means of trade not only but also the processes of production. In Europe it is destroy ing men and resources wholesale and upon a scale unprecedented and ap palling. There is reason to fear that the time is near, if it be not already at hand, when several of the coun tries of Europe will find it difficult to do for their people what they have hitherto been always easily able to do, many essential and fundamental things. At any rate they will need our help and our manifold services as they have never needed them before and we should be ready, more i:t and ready than we have ever been. And there is another great piece of legislation which awaits and should teceive the sanction of the senate: 1 mean the bill which gives a larger measure of self-government to the peo ple of the Philippines. 1 cannot believe that the senate will let this great measure of constructive justice await the action of another congress. Its passage would nobly crown the record

W -V *i of these two years of memorable la bor. An Important Duty. But I think that you will agree with me that this doeB not complete the toll of our duty. How are we to carry our goods to the empty markets of which I have spoken if we have not the certain and constant means of transportation upon which all profit able and useful commerce depends? And how are we to get the ships if we wait for the trade to develop with out them? The routes of trade must be actually opened—by many ships and regular sailings and moderate charges—before streams of merchandise will flow free ly and profitably through them. Must Open Gates of Trade. Hence the pending shipping bi'.l, discussed at the last session, but as yet passed by neither house. In my judgment such legislation is Impera tively needed and cannot wisely be postponed. The government must open these gates of trade. I very earn estly hope that the congress will adopt this exceedingly important bill. The great subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with, and it is a matter of deep regret that the difficulties of the subject have seemed to render it impossible to complete a bill for passage at this session. But it cannot be perfected yet. Economy Is Urged. Before I close, may I say a few words upon two topics, much dis cussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgments should be clear, definite and steadfast. One of these is economy in govern ment expenditures. The sort of economy we ought to practice may be effected, and ought to be effected, by a careful study and assessment of the tasks to be per formed and the money spent ought to be made to yield the best possible returns in efficiency and achievement. And, like good stewards, we should so account for every dollar of our ap propriations as to make it perfectly evident what it was spent for and in what way it was spent. It is not expenditure but extrav^ gance that we should fear being criti cized for not paying for the legiti mate enterprises and undertakings of a great government whose people command what it should do, but add ing what will benefit only a few or pouring money out for what need not have been undertaken at all or might have been postponed or better and more economically conceived and car ried out. The nation is not .liggardly it is very generous. It will chide us only if we forget for whom we pay money out and whose money it is we pay. These are large and general stand ards, but they are not very difficult of application to particular cases. The National Defense. The other topic I shall take leave to mention goes deeper into the princi ples of our national life and policy. It is the subject of national defense. It cannot be discussed without first answering some very searching ques tions. It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared for war. What is meant by being prepared? Is it meant that we are not ready upon brief no tice to put a nation in the field, a na tion of men trained to arms? Of course we are not ready '.o do that and we shall never be in time of peace so long as we retain our pres ent political principles, and institu tions. And '.at is it that it is sug gested we should be prepared to do? To defend ourselves against attack? We have always found means to do that, and shall find tb»m whenever it is necessary without calling our peo ple away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military service in times of peace. Fear No Nation. We are at peace with .11 the world. No one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a just and candid interpretation of realities can say that there is reason for fear that from any quarter bur indepen #nce or the integrity of our territory is threatened. Dread of the power of any other nation we are incapable of. We are not jealous of rivalry in the fields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our lives as we will but we mean also to let live. We are, indeed, a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we theraten none, covet the possessions of none, desire the overthrow of none. Our friend ship can be accepted and is accepted without reservation, because it is of fered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever question or suspect. Therein lies our greatness We are the champions of peace and Raymond L. Ditmars, curator of the Bronx zoo. The snakes were placed upon the dinner table in a glass recep tacle from which they could easily have escaped.

Just now wo should be particularly jealous of it# because It Is our dearest present hope that this character and reputation may presently, in God's providenco, bring us an opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a healing settle* ment of many a matter that has cooled and interrupted the friendship of nations. This Is the time above all others that we should wish and re solve to keep our strength by self-pos session, our influence by preserving our ancient principles of action. Ready for Defense. From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to military establishments. We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals we never shall have, a large standing army. If asked, are you ready to defend yourselves? We reply, most assured ly, to the utmost and yet we shall not turn America into a military camp. We must depend in every time of national peril, in the future as in the past, not upon a standing army, nor yet upon a reserve army, but upon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based upon our ac customed principles and practices, to provide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for the training may be made familiar with the use of m- dern arms, the rudi ments of drill and maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of camps. We should encourage such training and make it a means of discipline which our young men will learn to value. The National Guard of the states should be developed and strengthened by every means which is not inconsistent with our obligations to our own people or with the estab lished policy of our government. And this, also, nc» because the time or oo casion specially calls for such meas ures, but because it should be our constant policy to make these provi sions for our national peace and safe1 ty. More than this carries with it a re versal of the whole history and char acter of our polity. More than this, proposed at this time, permit .me to say, would mean merely that we had lost our self-possession, that we had been thrown oft our balance by a war with which we have nothing to do, whose causes cannot touch us, whose very existence affords us opportun ities of friendship and disinterested service which should make .s ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for trouble. This is assuredly the opportunity for which people and a government like ours were raised -up, the opportunity not only to speak but actually to em body and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting con cord which is based on justice and fair and generous dealing. Ships Our Natural bulwarks. A powerful navy w* have always regarded as our proper and natural means of defense and (t has always been of defense that we have thought, never of aggression or of conquest But who shall tell us now what sort of navy to build? We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas, in the future as in the past nnd there will be no thought of offense or of provo cation in that Our ships are our natural bulwarks. When will the ex perts tell us just what kind we should construct—and ,when will they be right for ten years together, if the relative efficiency of craft of differ ent kinds and uses continues to change as wa have seen it change under our very uyes in these last few months? But I turn away from the subject It is not new. There is no new need to discuss it. Let there be' no miscon ception. The country has been misin formed. We have not been negligent of national defense. We are not un mindful of the great responsibility resting upon us. We shall learn and profit by the lesson of every expert ence and every new circumstances and what is needed wtl'l be adiequately done. Great Duties of Peace. 1 close, as I began, by reminding you of the great tasks and duties ol peace v/hich challenge our best powers and invite us to build what will last, the tasks to which we can address ourselves now and at all times the free-hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we pos sess. To develop our life and. our re sources to supply our own people, and the people of the world as their need arises, from the abundant plenty of our fields and our marts of trade to enrich the commerce of our own states and of the world with the products of our mines, our farms, and our fac tories, with the creations of our thought and the fruits of our charac ter—this is what will hold our atten tion and our enthusia -a steadily, now and in the years to come, as we strive to show in our life as a nation what liberty and the inspirations of an emancipated spirit may do for men and for societies, for Individuals, for states, and for mankind. by a fern filled with chirping Insects, known throughout Japan, whence thejr came, as "walking sticks.".

ALBERT S. GRAY, M. D. (Copyright. 1914. by A. S. Gray) SUNLIGHT AND INFECTION8. The daily newspapers recently pub lished the following paragraph: "At a conference of the Association for the Prevention of Consumption at Leeds, England, Sir William Osier of Oxford, formerly of Johns Hopkins university, startled the audience by the announce ment that 90 per cent of all people probably have 'a small focus or area of tuberculosis.'" The audience was "startled" by the assertion only because we habitually give very little heed to any matter that does not immediately concern us indi vidually, or that is not forced upon us by circumstances that compel our con centrated attention. The statement has been made by Osier and by many other authorities in substantially the same worde again and again in the past, but It did not 'Wick" at the time solely for the reason that few happened to be in a receptive mood. It is an undeniable fact that unless one te in a receptive mood the most obvious and sublime truth falls on unheeding ears, and in this fact we have a most instructive illustration of the beginning of tuber cular disease in our bodies, the prin ciple involved being identical in either case. For just as the mind must be re ceptive to be able to receive^ to hold and to develop a truth, so must our bodies be receptive in order to receive, hold and develop tubercle bacteria, or any other bacteria. No life can pos sibly develop in an unfavorable en vironment. It te perfectly well known among the medical profession that whatever may have been the cause of death, postmortem examinations usually show a small area where tuberculosis has existed, but that has been "cured" by nature's method of fencing about and Imprisoning any invading matter she Is strong enough to overwhelm. Any invading bacteria are either devoured by the white corpuscles or are fenced about and "encysted" if the organism has sufficient vitality to fight but if there is not sufficient vitality then the individual becomes one of the 150,000 that die annually in this country from some form of tuberculosis. We have noted that white sunlight not only develops plant life, but that it also exerts an inhibitory or restrain ing effect as well. This is clearly proved by the fact that certain plants are found to grow faster and taller under red and blue light than they do under white light, and that they are stunted or even killed under green or violet light. We do not know why plants react in this way, but we have positive proof that they do. And it is equally certain that bacteria generally are either quickly killed or profoundly modified by the rays at the violet end of the 'spectrum. It should require no great strength of (he imagination, then, to understand why we have epidemic out breaks of pinkeye, influenza, diph theria, sore throat, measles, scarlet fever, "colds" and the like following any profound disturbance in meteoro logical conditions that tend to inter fere with the normal amount of pure sunlight reaching us. Because it mat ters not what it may be, whether it is smpke, dust from volcanoes, excess moisture condensing into clouds, col» ored glass, or brick walls and tin roofs, anything standing between any living thinp and, the sun must mate rially modify that life. Its vitality is. In direct ratio to the amount of energy received through its normal: line- of connection with the sun. We prove this with plants by grow-1 lng them in dark rooms, or under col ored glass, which is only a simple means for shutting out such parts of the spectrum as we desire, and also It is proved by the extent to which large areas of growing crops are In fested with disease during long con tinued cloudy weather. It has been conclusively proved that the eum of the work executed by the and it the heat which tt gives out, is exactly equivalent to the chem ical potential energy taken in with its food, and this wei know can be equal only to the kinetle energy of the sun light stored up during the production of the plant. AH the potential energy of vegetable matter is converted' sun light And today our individual energy is derived uuite directly fromi that same •ource. Four factors are necessary to produce any plant crop—seed, soil, moisture and direct sunlight' and the absence of any one of the last three factors will inevitably result either in a total failure of the seed to germinate or in Mine abnormal development Beed and, a favorable enviromeht re •nit in a plaint growth and a germ, which Is only a very small plant, In ah iphf-oqr bpdles, for instance under conditions where there most fesalt a 'growth which we have come to call "inttetlott." For the development of .an infection either'tkegarm aaathevsry ifeplfit. •».««'- ism very muoh enfeebled. We are fast coming to believe that the latter is generally the case. The success of heliotherapy on tu bercular invalids In the Alps and is France proves there is some action through the skin we do not yet folly understand, and it is encouraging to note that the matter is being taken up in this country. Loss of appetite, loss of ambition and energy all sorts of dyspepsl variously diagnosed as "hyperacidity, "atony," etc., may be the first lndl tion that a tubercular focus is becom* ing active somewhere.' Fresh air, sun light, simple substantial food and freedom from fear and worry are the sovereign remedies for such condi tions. FRESH AIR AND TUBERCULOSIS That there was any tuberculos.U among the human race in the prehis toric days when men lived wild am rugged lives without fixed habitatio: in the mild climate where the speciei first developed is highly improbable The disease undoubtedly madie its flrsj appearance only after men began herd together and live a communal life the evidence seems to prove that it tends constantly to increase pro gressively with our advance in mater ial wealth and culture as the indi vidual is more and more removed from the fundamental source of ener gy. In the writings of Hippocrates, th father of medicine, who lived 460' tc 359 B. C., are directions for the cart of a case suggestively familiar to us, for he describes something suspicious ly like modern tuberculosis, correctly Interpreting it as a fever and recom mending for it fresh air, change of ell mate %nd hygienic living. From the fact that Gelcus, a Rom an medical writer who lived in tht first century A. D:, and. Claudius Gal en, a Greek physician and medical writer (A. 131 to 200), approve Hip poerates' advice in their writings, it is reasonable to assume that the pray ers and incantations customary among the priests and people generally from the dawn of history were still depend ed on in that day to combat the dis ease. Galen in: his writings recog nized tuberculosis to be contagious. In general from the birth of the tribe down through'the centuries when the physician was half magician and half priest, and' to doubt his skill was an act of impiety, the demand has been for pure magic, and, of course, strenuous efforts have been made to supply the demand. This effort will continue until an enlightened people cease to ask the impossible. Invalids have been bled to death and dosed with poisonous elixirs of life to no avail, but the people have held stead fastly to their faith in magic. But with the cultivation of a pecul iar greenishrgray scum, fungus or mold on egg albumen by Klebs in 1877 there began an era of sanity. From this beginning Robert Koch in 18S2 succeeded in isolating and staining the tubercle bacillus. From this point step by step we have advanced along the road leading to control of the disease and after all the wqfidering. and experimenting are finally today back where that keen eyed thought ful old Greek, Hippocrates, stood 2,300 years ago. Fresh air and: hyglenio living are the key which, modern sci ence holds- out for the release of hu-t manity from the bondage of tuber culosis. Healthy blood is the most certain and vigorous of all'germicides, and it is very certain that there never will be discovered any method for the manufacture of healthy blood superior to the natural one of drawing an abun dance of fresh, clean air into the lungs, introducing plenty of simple, wholesome food into the stomach,, keeping the skin clean and active, an$ in general- living a sane, normal life. Just recently I have- been- asked, by the mother of a delicate girl if night air was safe for her to breathe. The: results secured among, the snow, cov ered: peaks of the Alp»in cases of sur? gical tuberculosis of tile bones furnlsl the answer to this question. Cases ol undeniable tuberculosis have beet^ carried' to the point of treatment hef cause the invalid was too weak ta walk, and heliotherapy has been trie*} as the last resort before the amputa tion that had been recommended by competent authority. In the course of a few months the victim, with the skin from head to foot taataedi to the color of apiece of rare mahogany, has recovered sufficient vitality to enjoy going out in the cold, crisp, air arrayed in nothing but a breechcloth and play ing games In the snow, flood food, fresh air, and the general tone ac quired from coming, close to nature are what is responsible for the won derful results secured in those Insti tutions. a Very obviously the lesson to the rest of us should be that it Is our in dividual duty to our family and the community to make such good use of this knowledge of nature's work ings that we shall not become infirmi and a burden. Ko one Is Imuran* un less he lives a rational normal life and none is so strong that he may not quickly become weak. It is In these periods of weakness that Infection may seise as, to be subdued only through the regaining of vitality. But the tronhlp Is not "cured it Is simply latent and ready to flare up again the instant we permit our vital powers t« drop below a certain point.
