Under those clicunistancos I have declined to inova any such colony to any State without (list obtaining tho consent ol lis Government, with nn agreement on its part to lecolvo nod protect such emigrants In all their rights as freemen, and I h.ivu at tho same time ulVorod to tho sjvoral States, situated in the tioplcs, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them on the subject, with tho advice and con sent of tho Senate, to favor the voluntary em igration of uorsons of that class to their ro spectivo teriltoiics on conditions which shall bo cipial, just and humane. l.lheiia and Ilsjtl arc, as yet, tho only countries to which colonists of Afiican de scent from hero could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citi.ous ; and 1 regret to say that such poisons contemplat ing colonization do not seem as willing to to emigrate to thesu countries as to somo others, nor as willing as I think thoir interest demands. I believe, however, that thu opin ion is improving, and that cio long thuro will bo an augmented ai.d considerable emigra tion to both these countries. Our relations with Kuiopean States remain undistmbed, and with States of our conti nent havo improved, especially .Mexico, Costa Rica, &c. The i'icsident favors tho projection of nn Atlantic telegraph and extending the l'ucillc lino to connect with that being built across the Itussinn Kmplrc.

It Is wor thy seiloiis consideration whether somo ex traordinary nioanircs to piomoto that end cannot bo adontud. The means which sug gest itself as most likely to elloct that cud is a sr.iuntillc exploration.
