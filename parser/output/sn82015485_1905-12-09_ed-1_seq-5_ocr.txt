Pome time ago Congressman Reeder declared himself boldly and above board that he is in favor of the Presi dent's railroad policy. The Toneka Capital hardiv "noticed it at all." Now Congressman Curtis, after "wab bling" around almost as bad as Sena tor Lone, troes to Washington ' TV n and rushes into an interview, and the Capital" "stands up" and puts out abont a half column of "Curtis' Pat Stand." O, how fair and honorable(?) THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Roosevelt has departed from his first policy of writing short messages. The address laid before Congress today is one of unusual length, even as long messages go But it must be remembered that con ditions in this country are undergo ing marked changes none the less rad ical because they are gradual and unattended by popular clamor. Few Presidents in timesof peace have been called upon tq give such consideration toconstructive policies as Mr. Roose velt. This fact is reeogmzed after a moment's reflection on his extraordi nary administration. It is more fully borne home on reading today's mes sage to congress, which is largely a reiteration and elaboration of former addresses to the national lawmakers. The President is justified in giving much attention to the subject Of cor porations, more especially the regula tion of transportation rates. He re mains inflexible in his plan for em powering a national commission to adjust disputed rates and, fix the max imum in a contested case. He favors the legaization of pooling, but only after the power of rate adjustment has been vested in a commission. His recommendations to regulate private cir lines, terminal railroads and other rebating devices are well known, and he formally urges the opening of rail way accounts to government inspec tors as the best means : to determine whether the laws are violated. The President is against over-capitalization. In fact he takes note of all the flagrant evils or corporation .lire, but without hostility to just license for these institutions and to big shippers. He proceeds on the lorty plane of the Square Deal. The President's foreign policy as revealod in his treatment of The Hague conference, the Monroe Doc trine and the Santa Domingo case, is an especially strong feature of this message. It shows that the . country has never' had a more earnest or a mure consistent conservator or peace than the man whose few enemies are wont to call him a war "lord or, more properly speaking, were wont to do this. - . No specific plan for insurance regu lation is proposed, but Congress is again urged to ascertain, its powers to deal with the insurance business and to act within those powersand accord ing to its lights to protect the policy Holders or the country. Apparently the President does not think now is the time to make a live issue of the tariff possibly in the beliet that what he regards sis of more immedi ate importance iniglit be jeopardized Dy. urging revision at. this time. He asks the removal of the Phiilippines tariff exzept on sugar and tobacco and the reduction on these articles to 25 per cent or the Dirigley rates.'" The whole realm or national condi tions and needs" is covered,, not per functorily, but with evidence of tre mendous earnestness, much thought and. sound' judgment.

WETZEL MURDER. From the Hill City RepnWIran. The adjourned preliminary hearing of Charles Keleher, charged -with be ing implicated in the murder of Wet zel on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 15, just east of the city, was called ,in. Judge .Poston's court Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock. -. Leland Roberts, wlio says that he alone killed yimng Wetzel, and that Keleher was present and ent part of the murdered boy's roonev, was on hand, having been brought t' the city on the morning passenger train from Hoxie by Sheri ff Ashcroft and depu ties, where he had . been confined n the Sheridan county jail ti.ice la t Saturday night. Couuty Attorney ITarwi called Rob erts to l lie witness stand.'who went into detail as to the killing of Charley Wetzel, relating about the Fame etory of the awful crime as was published in the last issue of the Republican, save and except that he yielded the blows with the singletree tbat-endtd the life of Charley Wetzel; that Ross or Rose (colored) was in no way con nected with the crime, he (Roberts) claiming that his first confession as told in the jail, at Salina was a story made out of whole cloth to protect himself. . The defense put nine witnesses on the stand to prove an alibi, showing the whereabouts of Keleher betwee i the hours of 1 and 4 o'clock p.m.-on the day the murder was committed, Roberts claiming the crime was com mitted between the hours of 2 and 3 p. ni. Considerable stress lias also been thrown on the proposition why Rob erts has made two confessions. Pray," which "one of- these confessions are the people to believe? The preliminary! hearing or Kele her was held late into the night, when Judge Poston bound him over to the next term of the district court, which convenes Tuesday next, December 5, Roberts waived a hearing, and vester- oay morning was taken on the up freight to Hoxie, where he will be kept .in jail until his case comes up before Judge C. W. Smith. .. It may be expected by the readers ot" the Republican that a long .article would appear in this issue, giving the evidence of all the witnesses in full, and as it is conceded by many that a newspaper js, to a certain extent, a moulder of public opinion, for such to appear at this time we opine would be unwise and not practical. ...The evidence in this case will have . to come out at the. December sitting of the district court, and it would be un wise on our part to publish the same", for such might make competent men incompetent jurors In the district court, and to this end we withhold anything from our columns. The board of county commissioners have secured the services of "ex-Chief Justice Doster to assist County Attor ney Harwi in the prosecution of Rob erts and 'Keheler for the murder or Charley Wetzel. Edgar Watson Howe writing from tire bosom or the Pacific ocean, says: "Four days west of Honolulu w will lose a day. Tyesday night we will go to bed, as usual, and when we awake at the usual time, it will be Thursday morning; we will have dropped Wed nesday entirely. Get the children in the high school to explain this to you; I can't. The captain . tried to get it through my head to-night, but railed. I can understand that we are losing twenty to twenty-four minutes every day, but since leaving home, we will have lost less than six. hours, at a point four days -west of Honolulu, whereas we will drop twenty-four. It is .because time isreconed from Green wich, and not from Atchison? ir the world's time, is ' reconed from Green wich. It should be changed to Chicago or Kansas City." Star.
