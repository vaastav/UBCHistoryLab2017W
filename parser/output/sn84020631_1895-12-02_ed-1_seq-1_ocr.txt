BIPUBLIOAN CAUCUS, The Republicans of the house of rep resentatives met in oaucus Saturday night and unanimously nominated ex Speaker Thomas B. Reed for speaker of the 64th congress. . Previons to Reed's nomination the cau- eos organized by electing Grosveroor, of Ohio, ohairman of the canons, Ellis, of Oregon, secretary.

A number of Republican senators in cluding Hanabrough, Pettigrew, Carter, Clark, Mantel, Dubois, Sbonp, Chandler, Gallinger and Prootor held an informal meeting and deoided to advooate an at tempt to reorganize the senate in the can ons to-day. They also pronounced in favor of a distribution of the appropriation bills among the various senate commit tees and also discussed the committee as signments of senators. It was evident the western men wonld stand together to seonre control of the committees which deal especially with western questions. THI SMUTS MUDDLK. The senate that convened to-day is composed of eighty-eight members, al though that number will not be complete until the validity of the alleged election of Mr. Dupond, in Delaware, is passed upon. There will be twenty-nine senators to present themselves for the oath of of fice. Thirteen of these are senators who have been re-elected, and sixteen are new members. After the filling of the long-standing vaoanoies in Washington, Montana and Wyoming last year, the senate stood politically, Republicans, 40; Democrats, 43, and Populists, 6, inolnding Senators Jones and Stewart, of Nevada. The new senate will have 42 Republicans, 88 Dem ocrats and 7 Popnlista, Messrs. Jones and Stewart still being inoluded in the last- named list. If Dupond is seated tbe Ke-. publican vote will be inoreased by one, thus making a total of 48. With the ad mission of two Republican senators from Utah, the total of the Republicans will then be 45, but the whole membership will have been inoreased to 90, and 46 will be oeoessary for a majority. The Republicans will still need the one vote they now laok. It is said that both sen ators Stewart and Jones will return to the Republican fold and insist npon voting with them. If this be true, the Republicans will then have sufficient strength to take possession of the senate in all its branoh- Congress Met at High Noon Promptly at noon to-day the senate and house were called to order amid usual soenes of animation and excitement marking the opening of oongresa. There was an added interest to-day on account of the ohanges involved and the large in flux of new blood. The crowd came through a drizzling rain, mist and mud. By 10:80 o'olock an Hour and a half before the time of the meeting the publio gal leries or both bouses were filled and an eager crowd overflowed into the onter oorridors.

Republican, of Pennsyl vania, tbe oldest member present, aatnin istered the oath of effioe to the speaker. ' v'' WHAT SPKAKEB USD SAID. Mr. Reed sDoke as follows: "It will not be unbecoming in me, I hope. If I aeknewledge to this assembly that it is very agreeable to me to stand ones more in the plaoe I left four years asro. Of the past, however, I shall not speak, for the past speaks for itself in terms more fitting and appropriate than any words whioh eonld come .from my lips, Mot shall I speak of tbe future, to we are not patting off harness but puting it on. Yet I think . I may venture to say of tbe future, in tbe light of the past, that if we do something whioh for the moment seems inadequate, it may be that time which has justified itself for us on many occasions may do so again. Those who have acted with wisdom heretofore may he fairly expeot ed to aot with wisdom hereafter. I am sorry to say that the pleasure asBO oiated with the honor yon have bestowed on me, an honor which no American citi zen oan fail to appreciate, and for whioh I give thanks, is but for a moment, while the oares and responsibilities extend over many days. So far as the performance of my dnties affects the whole people of the United States, I invoke their Con siderate judgment. So far as it affeots the members of this house, I ask from both sides of the ohamber that cordial oooperation without whioh I can not hope to suooeed, assuring them thttt no effort on my part will be spared to aid them in the performance of. their duties by that entire impartiality which is their just due." - ...

THE POWERS DISSATISFIED Disposition Manifested to Insist Upon the Demand for Extra Guard Ships in Turkish Waters. IMPORTANT MEETING OF AMBASSADORS Meanwhile Impression is Being Con veyed that Sultan Has Won Great . Victory Over the Powers ' British Flag Fired on. Copyrighted 1895 by Associated Press. Constantinople, Deo. 1, via Sofia, Bul garia, Deo. 2. While being desirous of not doing anything whioh. wonld tend to induce disturbances or hinder the work of restoring order, the powers again ap pear unanimously resolved to insist up on tbe demand for extra guard-ships. In oonseqnence of this resolution, the ambassadors have arranged for a meet ing to-morrow (Monday) to consider what aotion is necessary in . view of the sultan's oontinued objection t granting nrmans. Meanwhile the impression' is being oonveyed to the general public that the sultan has won a great victory over the powers. This tends to make the matter more delioate to handle. A Turkish official, discussing the with drawal of the Dryad, intimated that the powers held that if a passage of the Dardanelles is to be forced it should be done by the war ships of all the powers interested. This was tbe original under standing, bnt Great Britain, it appears, was not disposed to delay matters be yond a oertain point. The so-called firing upon the British ship Looh Bannooh, in the Dardanelles, is said by Turkish offioials to he easily explained. They say that the Loch Ban nooh arrived after sundown, and, instead of anohoring, attempted to proceed and was signaled from shore by a gun-shot to bring up. As she did not do so, a second shot was fired and the Loch Bannoch let go her anchor. A great deal of excitement was caused here to-day by a repoort that the ex-sul-tan, Mohamed II red, who wan disposed on the groand of idiocy on August 31, 1876, had escaped from Yildir , Kiosk, where he is kept a olose prisoner. The report, it appears, grew out of the flight of Marad Bey, tbe imperial com missioner of the counoil of the public debt, who was also suspected of having relations with the young Turk party.
