THE BAR HE DAILY TIMES, DECEALBEil 8, !!;(). BANK TAX LAW MAY REMAIN That's the Prospect in the Senate at Present IS REPORTED FAVORABLY Idea of Final Adjournment of the Legis lature Ts Fast Being Lost in Belief That an After-holiday Session Will Be Required. The Semite bill which proposed to cut down the tax on savings t.'t pottits in 'sav ings hanks and trust companies and na tiojiiil banks from 7-10 ot one per cent, to y of one per cent, is iK)t likely to ' pass, although it has been reported fa vorably b)' the committee on banks. The bill came up yesterday, and when the committee was questioned by Sen ator Gordon the fact was developed that although the decrease in the tax .would cut down the revenue to the state, the banks expected to raise their interest rate to lour per cent, and thus attract enough more deposits to more than make up the decrease. As a matter of fact, if there were no increase in deposits the change proposed by the bill would mean a loss to the state of over $155,000 an nually, to ofiset which would require sev eral millions more in deposits. In l!MKi, when the law limiting the amount that could be deposited in a savings bank exempt from taxation was aniendVd so that .$2,000 that wan in any or every bank in the state was exempt, it was thought that it would so largely increase deposits that the state would be a large gamer. trie eliange orougni rue siaie in about $15,000, and this fact is con sidered to have some bearing on what would happen if this Senate bill should become law. The idea of a final adjournment before Christmas seems to have been pretty much given up. The progress this week in disposing of business has been slow, and when the House yesterday speni over two hours discussitig a measure to allow towns to vote to have the road commissioners appointed by the select men, it about put an end to any linger- ing idea that anyone might have had of getting through before the holidays. With only 13 more working days left, it seems an impossibility, even if night sessions were resorted to, for with the amount of committee work remaining this would not help matters any. The bill to change the shire town ot Kssex county from Guildhall to Brighton is pretty sure to be reported adversely by the committee on town lines. At the hearing held on the bill, only three of the thirteen towns in- the county fa vored the change, and the committee is not disposed to recommend any change unless it is sntislied that a majority of the people of the county demand iv. There seems to be little doubt but what there are belter facilities for holding court at Island Pond than at Guildhall, anil the trouble connes from the inac cessibility of Islam! Pond to tile ten towns that oppose the change. Then, too, there is a feeling in the rest of the county that there is too much of a pre ponderance of Grand Trunk interests In Island Pond to make it a healthy place in which to hold the court in which so much railroad litigation is tried. A neat dodge was tiled in the Hours yesterday, when the bill granting the right to the Champlain Realty company to run logs in the Ottaquechee rivi fame up with an adverse report. An amendment was at once proposed, which strikes out all alter the enacting clause in the bill and substitutes practically what was struck out, but in a littlo different language. This eonies pretty near violating one of the House rules and will probnblv not serve to save the bill. If this bill is killfl, the com pany will not probur.'y make an attempt to push another bill granting it similar rights on the .Mad river.

Mead has signed the following Washington, Dec. 8. Bombs are hour ly being plucked from President Taft's message, as that remarkable document is studied more at leisure. One that will explode loudest is the very clear threat of the president of the removal of the lumber duties. W hue the hear iugs of the ways and means committee were in progress and thereafter, t strenuous attempt was made to discov cr the existence of a so-called lumber trust, hut it failed and the lumber men exultingly pointed out to Congress that no trust condition prevailed in the in dustrv hence no removal or reduction of the duties would be warranted on that score President Taft, however, appears not to have been contented to leave the sit uation in this shape and in his message he showed that while no trust or com bination in the manufacture of lumber exists, a direct investigation made by the commissioner of corporations of eighty per cent, of the privately owned timber demonstrates that one-half of tho timber in this area is owned by two hundred individuals and corporations and fourteen per cent, is owned by three corporations. the commissioner discov ers, ulso, a very extensive intcrow tier ship of stock and other circumstances pointing to such friendly relations am-nnif the owners as .might easily lead to a combination to hold up prices. The president regards these relations as eir cumstances "very detrimental to the public interest," and they would, he says, "create the neccMty of remov ing all tariff obstacles to the freo ira portation of lumber from other coun tries." These significant lines have alarmed the lumber interests as represented in Congress and have correspondingly en couraged statesmen of one kind or an other to bring some glory to the lie publican party, bv achieving a little tariff revision at this session. Tho lum ber dtuies are comparatively simple and the administration, if it were wiling to encourage anv tarff action in the near future, might not feel tinder ob ligation to await a special report of the tariff board before consenting to action. The president's words at least, are a hint to the lumoer industry that if too high prices are found to prevail, without any break along the line, evidence enough has already been adduced from official sources to warrant a removal of the protection which the unbroken line of nigh prices jtelf would prove to be un necessary.

Joint resolution oricinating in the House, relating to the investigation of the rates of transportation of the Mont- lands, a policy which the president p iiroves and the secretary does not. The president advertises to the country de liberately that he has overruled the sec retary on this very important point. This action at least invites a popular inference whether a cabinet officer so frankly discerd'ted by his chief on a great qui st ion of public policy would care to continue a member of the ad ministration. From the interior department also comes the interesting information, of ficially, of course, that Secretary Bal linger and Land Commissioner Bennett are not on good terms. One rMwin is said to be that, the commissioner's sup port of the secretary during the recent iiivestitratinn was rather more lukewarm than Mr. Ballinger liked. It has been announced as one of the purposes of the new Democratic administration to re open tho whole llalllnger-Pineliot ques tion in ease satisfactory action should not be taken in the course of the, pres ent session of Congress.
