Perkins, whose drowsily-clicking knitting-needles keep time to the purr uf the overgrown Maltese cat, nnd a pretty young girl with rather a flushed face, who had just entered from a door-wnr leading to the hall. "Well," said "Mrs. Perkins, looking tip with that ineffably wise expression which is imparted to the human countenance by round silver spectacles perched obliquely on the bridge of the nose, ' he ain't asleep? is he r" "Yes, he is;" was the answer. "Glory be thanked for that at least," said 3Irs. Perkins, apparently impaling herself on a long knitting-needle, which, however, entered ' harmlessly into the horn sheath that she wore at her side, encased in a scal loped red flannel. "There will be five minutes of peace at least. You're tired, ain't you, Dora?" "Yes," said -Theodora White, "I am rather tired." But her languid voice spoke plainly that the more accurate phrase would have been '"eery tired." Theodora Wfcitc was a slender, soft-eyed girl of eighteen, with a complexion of pearly whiteness, and a rose a piece on her checks a girl with a pure, straight nose and a dimple on her chin and a pretty pleading way of looking at you when she spoke. She sat down beside the window, where the mignon-nette-scented grape blooms were swaying in the summer air, and leaned her forehead againsi the casement. ilrs. Perkins eyed her with an owl-like glance of sympathy. "It's a shame, so it is," said Mrs. Per kuidreinphntiolly. "A man hasn't no business to be so tryln' no, not if he was sick forty times over! Scold, snap, suarl this ain't right and t'other thing is wrong! That's the way he keeps it up. Pd aa soon wait on the old boy ' him self." Theodora, smiled faintly and arched her eyebrows. ' " Why, Mrs. Perkins, you don't mean to compare my Uncle Joseph with so obnox ious a personage as you allude to?" she said,- demurely. "Well," said Mrs. Perkins, reflectively, "they ain't so unlike, after all. I declare, sometimes, when he gets in his tantrums, IVe two minds and a half to give him a good shakin'. There ain't no sense in a man s bcin so unreasonable. You can'', please him no way jou can lit it." . "We can at least try, Mrs. Perkins." "Y'es, aud that's jest what's a spilin' him. He knows very well that if he was to want the moon,' you d hunt up the longest step ladder ana try to reach it down. It al'ays did spoil children to let 'em have all they want, and your Uncle Joseph ain't nothin' but a growed-up child !" "But I don't let him have all he wants, Mrs. Perkins." "And a pretty kettle o' fish there'd be if you did. Humph!" and the old house Keeper pounced upon her ball as if she had, for a moment, .identified it with the personage under discussion. . " It mightn't be such a bad idea," said Theodora, alter a moment's thoughtful silence. "Be you crazy?" demanded 5lrs. Per kins, tartly. " Hush Theodora started from her seat with uplifted linger. "He is awake; he wants me." And she was gone, swift, noiseless as a white-winged dove, before Mrs. Perkins could volunteer to go in her stead. " Yes," said Mrs. Perkins to herself, " it is & shame. He seems to think she's made of cast iron and India rubber the old tor ment!" With this rather illogical expression of her opinion, Mrs. Perkins resumed her knitting more vigorously thau ever. Meanwhile Theodora hastened up stairs into a closely curtained sick-room, where a htierulons old gentleman lay, tortured with a great deal of " hypo " and a very little .actual illness. But Uncle Joseph White chose to believe lie was very ill; and who," pray, was a better judge of the state of his bodily health than himself? .He screwed his face up into the sem blance of a nut-cracker as his niece hur riedly entered the apartment und came to Ida bedside. I've been thumpin' on the floor till my anils are ready to drop out of -their sockets I" lie groaned. "Are,, y;u all deaf down utairsr or has old Perkins forgotten there's any one in the world but herself and her snuff-bos?" - "I'm very sorry, uncle !" "Actions apeak louder thun words!"' snarled Uncle Joseph, .ungraciously. "How do vou feel now, I'ncle Joseph?" asked Theinlom, soothingly. "I'm worse!" "Are you?" '""Pulse higher skin hot face flushed j of course I m worse. This confounded hot room is enough to throw any one into a fever! Open every door and window quick!" Without an Instant's hesitation Theo dora unbarred the blind, ami threw open four largo windows and two doors. The light from the western sky streamed like a Hood of fiery radiance into the room; the draught, whirling through, caught up newspapers, fluttered the leaves of books, and even unset Uncle Joseph's pet bottle of medicine. . "O-w-w-w !". roared the sick man, with vehemence, that proved his lungs at least to be quite free from disease j "do you want to bliiul mt to blow me away ?" . "You told me to do it, Uncle Joseph!" - ''Shut the windows, quick draw the curtains!" groaned Uncle Joseph. "Who's that battering down the door? "It's only a very gentle knocking, un cle." . ,; "Then I'm nervous. Go and see!" . Presently Theodora relumed. It's Major Crowfoot, undo he sends his compliments, and wishes to learn how you ore." ' "Tell ldra to go to the deuce." "Yes, uncle." "Well," aid Uuclo Joseph, as his niece reiurtiud to his bedside after a momentary absence, "what did ho say f He seemed very much offended, uncle." " Offended ! at what, pray ?" demanded VoclaJosepU. "I suppose at being told to go to the deuce!" answered Theodora, quietly, " Olrl, ' ejaculated the invalid, raising himself half-way upon his elbow, "you didn't tell him tuU " , " Yes, I did, uuclo. You said yourself ' Tell him to go to the deuce.' " Mr Joseph White tell back, flat and mo tionless amopg his pillows. ' Theodora, you are a fool !" " 44 I'm very sorry, uncle," said Theodora, beginning to whimper . Uuclo Joseph stared at her in surprise, Could it be l-iblo that the dreary days' and week of hur steadfast attendance had weakened her intellect and turned her brain.

Theodora brought in a neat little china bowl, with a silver spoon lving on the snowy, folded nnpkin that flanked it on the tray. Uncle Joseph took one taste, and threw down the spoon with a petulant sound not unlike a bark, "TrasK, trash! Insipid as dish-water. Throw it to the pigs!" . Theodora took up the .bowl and started obediently for the door. ' . "Here, here!" roared ' Uncle Joseph. " Where are you going to f" " Td the pig pen, uncle." "Are you crazy, girl? The gruel's well enough, only Mrs. Perkins forgot the nut meg." . "Jlut, uncle," said -Theodora, tasting daintily of the contents of the bowl, "It's insipid as dish-water." . " Will you allow mo to have an opinion of my own ?" snarled Uncle Joseph. " It's very good, if that old crone down stairs will add the nutmeg and give it another boil. Quick, now-I'm getting hungry! A man must eat, even if he's "at death's doort" A minute afterwards Mrs.'Perkins was surprised by Theodora's entrance. "Well," said the housekeeper, "what's awantin' now?" " A little grated nutmeg in this gruel, and uncle would like it warmed up once more." " What are you smiling about, Dora 't" " Was I smiling?" " Y'our eves was, if your mouth wasn't," said Mrs. Perkins, keenly. " Will you be as quick as you can, Mrs. Perkins ? said Theodora. " He stiys he is hungry," But when Theodora re-entered her uncle's room, the invalid had taken another tack. "Why didn't yon stay all day?" he growled. "Indeed, uncle, I hurried all I could," pleaded Dora. "Here's the gruel all smok ing." But Uncle Joseph shook his head. ' "It's too late ; I ve lost all my appetite !" he moaned. "Won't vou have the gruel, uncle ?" "Xo, I won't !" S?And Uncle Joseph closed his eyes, as if to signify he was too weak to debate the question" further. He waited anxiously for Theodora to press the question further, but she did not, and presently he opened his eves the least little bit in the world. ""Theodora!" "Sir?" "I'll tryjust One spoonful of that gruel before it gets cold." "AVhy, uncle, I threw it away." " Threw my gnel away!" gasped the sick man, breathlessly. "Yon told me yon did not want it, uncle." "I told you so ! Furies and liddle-Mriugs.r You miglit know by this time that I don't mean what I say: Get me some more quick ! If I hadn't been bedridden for a year, I could g twice as fist as you do !" he added, grumblingly. "I never saw such a snail in my life. Oh, dear! to thiuk I shall never walk again!" Uncle Joseph lay counting the seconds until his niece brought in a second bowl of gruel, this time so deliriously made that even he could not find fault with it ! "Uncle," said Theodora, as she set it on the table at the bedside, "the doctor said yesieruay, mm ne rvauy tuouut, u .vou were to try, you could walk as well as any body : "The doctor's a fool," said Uncle Jo seph, "and you may tell him so with my compliments!" " I will, uncle, the next time he coines." "Theodora!" "Sir?" " If you do, I'll disinherit you!" " Very well, uncle!" " Theodora, you'll have to feed me. This annoyance has weakened me terribly !" " Yes, uncle." . " Stop stop it's hot you're choking me !" But Theodora kept resolutely on. "Sto-OD!" spluttered Uncle Joseph, nimbly scrambling to the other side of the bed. What do you mean, Theodora? Didn't I tell you to stop? I don't believe there's an inch of skin left on my throat!" " Yon told me yourself, uncle, that you don't mean what you say. How was I to know that this was an exception!" An irat rejoinder trembled on Uncle Joseph's tongue, when suddenly he caught sight of a blue column of smoke wreath intr no under Ids window. "" What's that smoke?" he ejaculated. " I think it's Mrs. Perkius sir, putting fresh kindlings on the kitchen lire.' "No, it isn't!" yelled Uncle Joseph. "The house is on tire ! ' Theodora dropped the spoon and bowl, and rushed out of the room, shrieking, "The house is on fire! help! murder thieves!" The sen-ants below the stairs caught up the cry aud echoed it in shrill dismay. I ncle'Joseph listened with bristled hair and dilated eves. "Here! help?" he bawled, but no one responded. Louder still he yelled, but yet in vain. " Am I to stay here in my l)cd to be burned to death ?" ho asked himself, and scrambled out with agility that fairly sur prised himself. The servants were arrayed on the lawn, staring in all directions to find the exact locality of the tiro, when the gardener ut tered a shriek. "If there ain't master, as hasn't left his. bed for years, a ninnin' as if a tiger was arler him!" 'Where where's the fire?" panted Uncle Joseph, gazing wildly around hiin. Mrs. Perkius rushed to the front door, her tap-strings streaming. " I never ww such a pack of born idiots in my life!" she gasped. "There ain't fire only a few pieces of green wood I put oa the kitchen tire! One would think you'd never seen smoke afore, and why if there ain't master!" "Theodora," said Mr. White, looking somewhat sheepish, " where did you see lire?" " I didn't see it. uncle, but you said the house was ou tire," Theodora mado an swer, demurely, " and of course I thought you must know. Please, undo, go back to bed again." " I won't," said undo Joseph, gathering the skirts of his wrapper closerabout hint. " But, undo, you're sick." "No, I'm not!" " Uncle, do you really mean It ?" " Of course 1 do, Theo !" And ho did mean It, The cure had been effected ; and Theodora mentally congratu lated herself ou the success of her plan treatment. And Uncle Joseph never al luded to the day on which his niece had taken him so implicitly at his word. Pleasures of Memory.

I k'je, many ywtrs ago,' a very clever, Industrious, and talented young man, who told me that whenever he had Deen drink ing, he could hardly withstand the tempta tion of stealing anything that came in his way; but these feelings never troubled him at other times. One afternoon, after he had been indulging with his fellow-workmen in drink, his will unfortunately was overpowered, and he took from the man sion where he was working some articles, of worth, for which he was accused, Mid afterward sentenced to a term of imprison ment. When set at liberty he had the good fortune to be placed among some k'nd-hearted persons, vulgarly called tee otiilltra; and, from conscientious motives, signed the pledge, now above twenty years ago. From that time to the present moment he has never experienced the over-masterinir desire which so often beset him in his drinking days to take that which was not his own. Moreover, no pretext could now entice him to taste of any liquor containing alcohol, feeling that, under Us influence, he might again fall its victim. He holds an influential position in the town where he resides. I have known some ladies of good posi tion in society who, after a dinner or sup per party, and after having taken sundry glasses of wine, could not withstand the temptation of taking home any little arti cle cot thyr own, when the opportunity offered ; aud who, in their sober moments, have returned them as if taken by mistake. We have many instances recorded in our police reports of gentlemen of position, under the influence of drink, committing theftsof the most paltry articles, afterward returned to their owners by their friends, which can only be accounted for, psycho logically, by the fact that the will had been for the time overpowered by the influence of alcohol. That alcohol, whether taken in large or snuUl does, Immediately disturbs the nat ural functions of the mind and body, is now conceded by the most eminent physi cians. Dr. Brinton says : . " Mental acuteness, accuracy of percep tion and delicacy of the senses are all so far opposed by the action of alcohol, as that the maximum cnorts ot eaca are tneom P'Uible with the ingestion of any moderate quantity of fermented liquid. Indeed, there Is scarcely any calling which de mands skillful nnd exact efforts of miud and body, or which requires the balanced exercise of many faculties, that does not illustrate this rule. The mathematician, the gambler, the metaphysician, the bil liard player, the author, the artist, the physician,' would, if they could analyze their experience aright, generally concur in the statement, that a timjle qIimi itiU of tfnstijfic to take, so to-speak, the trfpe off both mind and txidy, and to reduce their ca pacity to something below what is rela tively their perfection of work." . Not long ago a railway train was driven carelessly into one of the principal London stations, running into another train killing, by the collision, six or seven persons and injuring many others. From the evidence at the inquest it appeared that the guard was reckoned sober, only he had tteo gliuee of ale with a friend at a previous station. Now, reasoning psycologioallv, these two classes of beer had nrobablv wen instru- mental in taking off Vie edie trom Ins per- ceptions and prudence, and producing a carelessness or boldness of action which would not have ocurred under the cooling, temperate influence of a beverage free from alcohol. Many persons have admitted to me that they were not the same after tak ing even one glass of ale or wine that they were lietore; ami couiu noi tiutrougmy trust themselves after one glass. Evidently, then, alcohol causes a person to commit certain acts in spite of himself, and in the face of his better judgement. Professors Lnllemand and Perrin, in their remarkable researches, have proved that alcohol, introduced into the system, pro duces in all persons un intoxication that is marked by a progressive series of func tional disturbances and alterations, the in: tensity ot which corresponds with the quantity of alcohol taken. Alcohol is no respecter of iienons. If taken it will as cer tainly operate on the queen upon the throne, as the beggar in squalid misery; on the minister of God's holy word, os the vilest reprobate ; on the judge upon the bench, as the criminal at the bar; on tho soldier who fights for his country, as ou tho humblest member of the peace society. Nonewho partakes uf it caa withstand its exsential influences, though he may ex emplify its power by varying actions and behavior. The Fast Man op tub Period. The fast young man of the period, if weighed in the balances of purity and justice, will lie found wanting. Catch one of these un thinking, untrained creatures of custom and appetite, and put him into the scales, and you will be astonished to find how light ho is ; ha is lighter than vanity. His head is light, for he has put nothing in it his heart is light for it is hollow , his pockets are light, for he has spent his money for liquor and tobacco. The heaviest part ot his person is in his stomach; that is capacious, and crammed with food which digests slowly because it is pickled in whisky. Analyze him. A fine hat fit for a better head, (seo hatter's account),- a iashiouable suit of clothes (not paid for); a neck-tlo (not of hemp); hair oiled and perfumed by the barber (who is shaved by his customer); mouth filled with a large quid of tobacco (for w hich he has not paid a quid pro quo) ; a body satu rated with alcohol. Who will copy such model, mado up of whisky and tobacco Foul breath coined into foul speech, diseased body dressed at other people's cost iu the hfghest style of fashion. He not a temperance man ; he can hardly be come a man until ho becomes temperate. I'eniperaiice Advocate. ; of BATHfo " Hateful " Tutxos.
