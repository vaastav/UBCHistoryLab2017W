the act of Assembly of Juno 41883 which is entitled An act to onforco time provisions of the seventeenth article of tho Constitution re lating to railroads and canals The net pro hibits discrimination In the transportation of freights allows triple damages and punishes with foci and imprisonment Tim S500000 rep resents the amount which time plaintiffs claim they are entitled to under time above act

to Mice Koblnsou A Wlthorop and others ami thor also allege that n contract exists between tile Penn sylvania Ilnllrond Company and the Standard Oil Company by which elnco the act ot 1883 wits parsed the Standard Company lint re ceived largo rebates from tim Pennsylvania llnllroad Company Those rebates ware made upon what is known as wheolngr the Htnmlard Compnny furnishing Its own tank cars nnd tho Pennsylvania Railroad Company doing the hauling Further investigation ft i is alleged will develop that nt the back of the 1onnsrl vanla Railroad Company Is the Standard Oil Company In this wheel matter and that what ever damage may bo recovered against the railroad company must in the end bo paid by the Standard Company The Injuries plaintiffs complain of have for a long time boon the subject matter of t com plaint As long ago ns 1881 when the first pipe line was laid n rate of freight was estab lished by the Pennsylvania Ilalltoad Company upon shipments of both crudo and refined oil If those rates had been retained and nil ship pers had boon mado to pay alike thorn would Lava boon no cause of complaint hut It Is as sorted that Instead of retaining those rates the rallrond company secretly entered Into an agreement allowing favored shippers in the oil regions a rebate of 15 oonts per barrel for crude and refined oil but in the BottlomontB it Is assorted that not withstanding these allowances the favored party received only 18 cents n barrel and the settlements wore made on that basis The fa vored shippers In and near Pittsburgh wore by this arrangement able to place their products at the seaboard much rhoapor than could the refiners and shippers of New York and Phila delphia and that their rebate in crude oil freights gave thcso favored shippers a marked advantage Mr Coulston Is preparing the papers for the bringing of these suits and they will bo ready in a few days It IB paid that there are a largo number of others who contemplate bringing similar suits TIme magnitude of the rebate system may bo gathered from the fact as It Is alleged that In nn Investigation instituted by the Senate of New York It was in evidence that the Pennsylvania RaIlroad Company
