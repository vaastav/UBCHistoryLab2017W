BUTLER CITIZEN JOHN H. L W. C. NE6LEY, PROP'RS, Entered at the Post office at Butle7 as second-classs matter. DEC. 12, 1883. THE~ Court House fire has delayed the issuing of the CITIZEN and prevent ed some matters from appearing this week. IN answer to the inquiry of a friend, we would state that the last Congress was Republican, and Keifer, Speaker of game, was Republican. The present Congress is Democratic. S. S. 

MEHARD, ESQ., has been ap pointed by the Governor President Judge of Mercer county, to fill out the unexpired term of Judge McDermitt, dee'd. Mr. Mehard is the law part ner of James A. Stranahan, Esq of Mercer, who it is said favored his ap pointment. He is represented as well qualified and a lawyer of good stand ing for probity and honesty. His time to serve will be to January, 1, 1885, an election taking place next fall for the regular term. 

FURIOUS FLAMES. Butler Court House in Ruins. About 8 o'clock Tuesday morning fire was 6een issuing from the top of one of the chimney flues of the Court House The flue from which the fire came was one of those up stairs in the room in which Court is held, from the smoke on the roof of the building it was soon apparent hidden fire was between the ceiling and the roof. The firemen were promptly upon the ground and did all possible to save the building, but all efforts failed and the whole building was soon wrapped in flames. At this writing, 12M., Tuesday, noth ing but the columns in front and the brick walls remain to tell the extent of the ruins. The records, we are glad to say, are all saved—a few may be dam aged, but none we think are lost. All the adjoining buildings, around the Diamond, are sayed. When the flames reached the cupola and the statue of General Butler the scene was as sad as it was grand. We understand insurance to the amount of $30,000 is upon the building. The Court, being in session this week, was removed for the time to the M. E. Church. Three accidents.we believe are all that happened—Mr. Ed ward Wevgand had his eyes badly in jured by the water from the hose, near the nozzle, being suddenly thrown in his face. Mr. Curtis Smith fell some distance in attempting to climb up in the inside ot the building in Bearch of the fire and has a sprained limb. Mr. Charles Heineman also received some injury from falling plaster. The present Court House was com menced in the year 1853, thirty years ago, finished in 1854, and, we think, first occupied in Dec. of that year or winter of 1855. President's Message. The readers of the 

CITIZEN will find upon its first page those portions of the recent Message of President Arthur to Congress that we deemed of most in terest to them. The parts that are not given are mainly concerning our affairs with certain foreign countries. As the extras, called supplements, that are now annually offered to the press and used by some as a means of circu lating the annual message of the Presi dent, have been found often very in correct, and are printed in such small type, we have declined to use them, preferring to giye it in what we know most of our readers desire, a larger type, and being therefore more easily read. As to the message itself, the general complaint is that it is non-committal on the questions of most importance to the people at the present time. It is difficult to find out just what his opin ions are on the currency and financial questions of the day. The part of the message most interesting to the people will probably lie the closing one, rela tive to the succession to the Presidency, in certain contingencies. It is a most earnest hope of all that Congress will not suffer this session to pass without enacting a law more clearly defining, not only the mode of electing the Pres ident and counting the electoral vote, but also that clause of the Constitution which speaks of the "inability" of the President to fill his office. The recent events of the country demand this legislation in order to secure its peace and permanence. How They Voted. All three of the members from this county in the Legislature, Messrs. Greer, Donly and Ziegler voted for the salary bill, paying full expenses for the continued or called session. They also voted to pass the bill ever the head of the Governor after his veto of it. Mr. Donly, we see it stated, returned to the Treasury $170.50, which, wo under stand, was the amount of the 11 dayß recess taken at the commencement of the session and five days absence. Mr. Greer returned 

SIOO tor, we presume, days of rece6B taken "at the commence ment of the session. We see no mention made in bis account of any days of absence. This perhaps was because those days were, as the vendue bills says, "too numerous to mention." As to Mr. Ziegler, so far as we have seen, he appears to have not presented bis warrant at the Treasury as yet. Since writing the above we see by the Philadelphia Times of Saturday last that Senator Greer returned but SIOO to the State and Representative Donly but sllO. The amount of the warrant presented at the Treasury by Greer was for $1,950, and that of Mr. Donly was for $1,940. Mr. Ziegler's warrant is for the same amount as that of Mr. Donly, but, as is stated, has not 4>eet» presented as yet. THE (iOYERNOR'S VETO. HE SENDS IN A SCATHING MESSAGE TO THE LEG ISLATURE—NO AP PORTIONMENT, NO PAY. Members' Flagrant Disregard of Duty. The Grounds for Withholding his Signature. Fr >a> Harritburg papers, Dec. G.] The scene in the House Tuesday morning was a lively one. Almost i every member was present and the j chamber appeared more as it did in the early days of the regular sessions than it has since the beginning of the extra session. It was all taik about pay- That a veto message would be receiv ed there seemed not the slightest doubt. It was impossible to tell what the out come would be should such a paper be received At 11:30 the Speakers gavel fell and order was secured. The private secretary of the Governor was introduced and presented a communi cation from the Governor of the Com monweath. It was laid upon the table and routine business taken up. It was the hour of noon before the mess age was read. It appeared to amuse the majority in the House and if a vote had been taken then there is but little doubt but that the bill would have been passed. A motion to postpone was made and debated at considerable length, and at one o'clock, it was de cided to adjourn until 4, when the bill was considered section by section and was passed over the head of the Go\- ernor by a large majority in both branches. The veto message in full is appended: 

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, COMMON WEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR, II ARRIS BURG, Dec. 4, 1883— To the llouseof Represent atives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania GENTLEMEN : ln accordance with the authority given to the Governor to disapprove of any items of an appropriation bill I disap prove of all the items in the herewith returned bill, except those items in Section 3, providing for the pay of cer tain employees of the Senate, and items in Section 4 for the pay of certain em ployees of the House, and Section T for the expense of serving a writ of election to fill a vacancy in the House of Representatives. To ail the other items of the bill I decline to give my approval The members of the General Assem bly were convened in special session for the sole purpose of apportioning the State as commanded by the Con stitution. The command was upon them to pass such laws at the regular session, but they adjourn*! a few days after their right to pay ceased, with their sworn constitutional duty unper formed. They were immediately re called into session to obey the organic law, to keep their oaths, and to accord to the people the most important politi cal rights. They again deliberately re fuse to perform their constitutional duty and are about to adjourn. After wasting six months in contemning the Constitution, they now send me this bill, appropriating over half a million dollars to pay themselves lor refusing to do what they were elected and sworn to do. Every consideration of law and the simplest principles of com mon justice protest against such an at tempt to take the money of the people without consideration. There is no law authorizing public officers to pay themselves for defying the law. Such an inconsistency could not exist in the jurisprudence of any enlightened trov ernment. No citizen in his private business capacity would sanction such a principle as that underlying this bill. The fact that one has been elected by the people to an office does not of itself entitle him to pay. He must first per form the duties of his office. As well might a judge claim his salary who re fuses to hold court or try the causes be fore him. The members of this Legis lature have refused to do their duty in compliance with the command of the Constitution, the vow of their official oath, and the purpose of their elcctiou. When this session was convened, in stead of proceeding at once to perforin their duty, the members of the Legisla ture, for their personal convenience, im mediately took a recess for eleven days. By this bill every Legislator is given of the people's money ten dollars a day for each day of that recess. To sanction this would be to admit that they might have taken a recess for the year and a half remaining of their terms, and have paid themselves many thousands of dollars each, while remaining at their homes and attending to their private concerns. For over one-half the time since the Legislature was convened the Senate has not been in session at all, having by formal resolution deliber ately resolved not to sit, or make an effort to obey the law. On many of the days when it did hold sessions but a few minutes were occupied, and no single official act was done looking to a performance of duty. The record of the House of Representatives upon this subject white no so culpable is yet highly reprehensible, it not having held sessions for many days. Yet for the whole one hundred and eighty-two days, from Juue 7 to December 5, whether days of session, no session, or sham sessions, Lord's days aud holi days, for all alike, ten dollars a day for the entire time, is given by this bill to every Senator and Member. Monstrous as such a claim would be under any circumstances, it is yet the more repugnant to law, equity ar»d common sense, when asserted by offi cials who menace the very existence of Republican Government by refusing to obey the plainest an I most imperative of constitutional commands and give to the people the most sacred and valuable of political rights. This bill exacts to the last penny all the compensation that the most faithful, industrious, patriotic and law-obeying Legislators could get for the performance of every dutv imposed upon them and the reali zation of every public benefit that could be expected from them, Under this bill mileage is claimed by members and officials for going from their homes to the seat of government aud returning, who were present in Harrisburg when tbe extra session was called, having been paid by tho State to be there, aud who have also been al ready paid for returning to their homes. So, too, ten dollars a day i* claimed by this bill for sessions upon days when, to use the language of the law, there were no sessions held "at" which members could be. It would be useless for uie to go over tbis bill and discuss its unjust pro visions in detail, it is a most indelens ible attempt to take money out of the public treasury without warrant of law, shadow of justice, or possibility of right bv a body of officials which, as the Ex ecutive of the Commonwealth, I am obliged to say resists, defies and as saults the constitutional government of the people. There often come times in the history of popular government when the only hope of their preservation rests, not in the functional power given to offi cials, but in that last and mightiest of resources, the intelligent and resolute action of a free people at the ballot box. This hope alone is left to the lovers of free government in Pennsylvania lor the enforcement of the laws and the preservation of the Constitution. I have exhausted all my power to that end without avail, aud confess the futility of my efforts. Not only may I be unable to secure obedience to the Constitution and see that the laws be faithfully executed, but I may also be powerless to prevent the gross injustice attempted against the people in this bill. So far as lam able, however, I shall thwart the wrong by this disap proval. It is only right for me to say that there are, 1 know, many members of the Assembly who have faithfully striven to perform their duty, and who by such efforts have equitably earned their pay. They are in no wise charge able with the default of this session. I regret that they should suffer by this veto. It is their misfortune to be mem bers of a body whose acts I must view as a whole. They will have the con sciousness, however, of having honest ly tried to serve their State and the people. The people it is certain will not fail in the end to recognize and re ward upright servants and separate them from the faithless and avaricious. I have no power to distinguish the worthy from the unworthy, the deserv ing from the reprehensible. The fault of the gross, not the merit of individuals, is all of which I can take notice. Seeing no legal reason, however, for depriving of their pay the employees of the two houses, whose attendance was compulsory, and who are in no way blameable for tbe failure of this session, [ have approved the items for their compensation. 1 wish to be under stood, however, in allowing these items to approve of the compensation ot these employees only for those days when they were necessarily employed about the duties of their offices. They may have had official service to perform upon davs on which the Legislature was not in session If so they should be pa d. But for those days on which they were absent from attendance upon duties pertaining to the Legislature and unemployed I do not give my sanction to their drawing any compen sation. I regard the word "fixed by law" in the clause of the bill making tbe approp. iation for them asrecogniz ing"this limitation, which, in my judg ment, is a proper interpretation of tbe act of 1874. 

ROBERT E. PATTISON. Hox. THOMAS M. BAVNE, member in Congress from Allegheny county, has introduced a joint resolution pro posing an amendment to the Constitu tion of the United States, providing for the election by the people of post masters, U. S. District Attorneys and Revenue Collectors. This is a move in the right direction and one that the public will strongly endorse. Particu larly in the matter of postmasters has there been a very general sentiment all over the country for their election by the people in the locality interested. .Mr. Bayne's bill will be watched with interest. Although tbe road to its adoption is a long one, yet by active and continued exertion it is hop ed the effort will succeed. Parker Township Items. One of tbe school bouses of this twp., commonly know as the Daubenspeck school, was burnt to the ground last Tuesday night. It is supposed by some, to have been an act of incendiar ism, but "no telling." It was a great loss, however, to the people of that dis trict, as about one hundred and fifty dollars worth of books was lost, and it is well known this school hod tbe best books of any in the township. We must add that tbe Directors have ex hibited a surprising lack of energy in regard to getting tho school in running order again. It was a rather naughty act of the young 1 man "across the hollow," brush ing the old crippled soldier, we would rather not tell such a story and won't. It is said that one of the oldest news boys in America, lives at Bruin, and soils the Sunday Leader —and where does it lead to ? Merchants here are filling up with a nice display of Holiday goods. G. W. Daubenspeck, .Jap, W. Orr and W. C. Parker of this township are attending Court this week as Jurors. Last week Win. M. Emerick and John McX amara were the honered ones. a feeling of Christian unity seems to be prevailing among the peo ple of this place, and especially is it so among the ministers who have charges ia this place. J. M. Coulter has finished the water wheel and dam, for running Wolfs wells along the creek and it is said works well and will be a vast saving to the owner in the end. JONES.

BUT THREE JURORS SECURED Out of a Panel of Eighty, the Court Decides that Fayette County is Biased AND TRANSFERS THE CASE TO PITTSBURGH. UNIONTOWN, Dec. s.—Xo Fayette j county jury will determine the fate of j .lames Nutt. After exhausting the i largest panel of jurors ever drawn in , the county, the Court this afteruooii granted a motion on the part of tbe de fense for a ehanj;e of venue, aod fixed Pittsburgn as tbe place of trial. When the prisoner was arraigned at 9 o'clock this morning the court room, within the bar, gave a fairly accurate picture of the Duke's trial reversed The short, strong figure aDd fat fea tures of the defendant in the former case are now mouldered down upon his bones in the little burying ground in German township. In his place in the dock this morning a taller, slender er figure lifted another smooth, young face up before the eyes of the Clerk of Courts, the face and figure of a young man who pleaded "not guilty to the cbarg* of murdering the man who bad risen up from the same chair less than a year ago to plead "not guilty" of murderiug tbe father of the present defendant. The same clerk read the indictment to each, and gave to each with equal apparent fervor his official benediction, "God seud you a good de liverance." Judge Wilson sit again upon tbe bench, no more delicate or dyspeptic looking now than then Be side him to-day, however, was his soon to be successor, Judge-elect lugbram Ab'jut the prisoner were grouped the same faces that surrounded the Com monwealth table at the trial of Dukes W. 11. Play ford, strong and earnest, with his hair rampant as ever above his forehead; beside him A. D. Boyd, young and blonde and handsome. Be side the prisoner, her long crape veil sweeping bis knee, as she leaued fre quently over to whisper to him, was his mother, the widow of Captain Nutt. Tbe dead Captain's brother, whose resemblance to him was so remarked upon at the last trial sat near her, by her side with another brother and one of hers, James Wells. THE 

COUNSEL FROM ABROAD. Added to these familiar figures were three others. Opposite the prisoner, towering above all about him, Senator Voorhees of Indiana, the tall syca more, sat, his bands crossed upon his knees, his eyes intently study the face of each juror as he was called. Ex changing whispers occasionally with Voorhees, Major A. M. Brown sat be tween tbe big Senator and tbe white haired man with the Emperor William face and whiskers, Marshall Svvartz welder. The prisoner was scarcely so calm, so stolid, rather, as the man whose verdict of acquittal he reversed. His lips trembled occasionally during the first half hour, and he fidgeted nervously at times in bis chair. At tbe Commonwealth table sat the same District Attorney who had pros ecuted Dukes; at bis elbow young John whose father's shrewed speech let Dukes go free to his death; at the other side of the table I) F. Pat terson, who had been brought up from Pittsburg to meet the shock of the heavy artillery upon the other side. Behind them, "carefully nursing his silk hat of ancient black and frizzly surface upon his knees, spare and stooped, with a thin face and forehead looking over the back of bis bead, sat ol 1 As bury Struble, the step father of N. L. Dukes, and beside him Lewis Dukes, tbe dead man's brother. Mrs. Struble was not present. From the moment tbe crier called Wm. L. Stewart, clerk, of George twp., the first juror, out of tbe crowd that throng, d the Court room from bar rail ing to door, unlil 3 o'clock this after nooD, when Play ford rose, after the last name had been called, and ac knowledging the impossibility of get ting an impartial jury in Fayette county, moved for a change of venue, it was a series of dreary, uninteresting repetitions of the same questions and the same answers. JURORS WHO WOULDN'T DO. Win. L. Stewart, clerk, of George township, had formed an opinion. He would do his best, if sworn, to try the ea.se upon the evidence, but it would require some evidence to turn him from his present opinion The Judge laid down the rule which he followed through the panel, that if it would re quire any of the evidence to be con sumed in driving Out a present impres sion the man having such an impression was unfit to try a case of such grave importance. Such an acknowledgement from a juror he ruled to be sufficient disqualification, and challenges upon it were invariably sustained. Clerk Stewart was challenged fur cause. So was the next man, Elisha llickard, a sturdy country blacksmith, who declar ed that his opinion was so lirmly fixed that no amount of testimony could change it. William I'atton, a bald headed carpenter who cauip next, would have served, but he lives in the section of the county in which Captain Nutt used to reside, aiul the prosecution bar red him out of the box with one of the four peremptory challenges allowed them. The defense didn't iike the hard, stern features of the next man. .John llanan, an old Dunbar farmer, and challenged him peremptorily. And so it went on. The sixth man called, Thomas J. Conn, a country merchant, the handsomest man in the panel, had peculiar ideas about capital punishment, but so long as the law stood he would find a veidict in accordance with it and the facts. The prosecution didn't seem to admire his peculiar ideas and stood him aside, to challenge him peremptori ly at last, when the panel was exhaust ed and he came up again Harvey Coburn, an old white haired farmer in a blue coat and brass buttous, who was called niqth, had no opinion now at all, hadn't talked about the case iu llusted's j grocery store nor to Lewis Dawson, j but the defense challenged him per- j emptorily. Playford smiled across to | the other table when the prosecuti n , challenged Christopher Holsley for cat}ge. liolsley is a bitter Searight j Democrat. THE 

LONESOME TI|HE|-,. Finally at the twenty-eighth name, | that of Win. A. McDowell, ex-editor of; the Qpnius of fjibcrly, a \ ale College graduate and a njan of general intelli gence, a Democrat, but not a Searight partisan, both sides for the lirst time said, "let him be sworn," and he took his place in the box. When the court adjourned foruinnerat 1 o'clock, he still j sat alone in tbe box. Fifty-eight of the j 80 names in the panel had been drawn j without finding another satisfactory juror. Then the lawyers began to talk cf a change of venue. Voorhees said at dinner that be did not believe 12 im partial men could be found to try this j case in Fayette county, and cited a j somewhat similar case in Kentucky in j which Speaker Carlisle was concerned, ! when the jurors had to be drawn from an adjoiir-g county. Court met again j in the i f t-ruoon and exhausted the pant! without getting another juror on ! the first call. Two of the four stood j aside, Martin Mitchell, a farmer who j would rather not hang a man but wouid follow the evidence, and John Conn, a carpenter, whom tbe prosecution had attempted to turn away for cause— these were accepted, making three iu all. The defense had challenged five peremptorily and the prosecution three. Two were disqualified by conscientious scruples about capital punishment. All the others bad formed opinions about the guilt or innocense of the prisoner. Among them all one man, an old labor er from Upper Tyrone, Abraham Stew art, had not read anything about tbe case in the papers and had no opinion. The defense hesitated and consulted. Finally Playford asked: "Wasn't your father's name Hamilton?" "No, it was John," was the answer. "Chal lenged peremptorily," from Mr. Play ford. THE CASE SENT TO PITTSBURG. When the panel was exhausted Mr. Playford moved for a change of venue, citing the experience of the day as evi dence that it was almost if not quite impossible to get a jury in Fayette county. James Wells, Mrs. Nutt's brother, made tbe affidavit required by the act of Assembly, in which he simply testified to the efforts made in court to secure a jary, and gave his opinion that it would be impossible to get one.* The prisoner petitioned formally in writing for the change of venue. Voorhees and Brown each made a brief speech, urging the gravity of the issue, danger in selecting a jury by extraordinary means, and the strong partisan feeliug evidently present in Fayette county. The prosecution made no opposition to the motion and tbe Court granted it. There was some discussion over the selection of tbe county to which the case should be taken, Patterson and Johnson for the Commonwealth objecting to Allegheny upon the ground that the Pittsburgh newspapers bad given such full reports of the previous events that public opinion was as thoroughly made up there as in Fayette, they would be sat isfied with anv other county. Voorhees and Brown urged the convenience of Pittsburgh and the opportunity to give the defendant a speedy trial, to which he had a right. Tbe Court agreed with them and said there was no doubt an impartial jury could be obtained in Al legheny county, and made the order accordingly. The prisoner and bis friends express ed themselves much pleased with the change and the selection, and the gen eral feeling iu town is oue of gratifica tion and expectation of an acquittal. It was decided this evening by coun sel to take up the case in Pittsburgh the first week of January. The Cornet band here serenaded Senator Yoorhees, A. M. Brown and Marshall Swartz welder this evening. The former and latter made short addresses, which were cheered loudly by the large crowd present.
