The speech bears all those evidences of tun- sire thought and clearness of statement for which the able speaker is so mach distin guished. It Trill be seea thtt Mr. Morton denies the right of secession and takes the bold, nanly and patriotic ground that the Federal Government should pretest seces sioB, or one State withdrawing from the rest prevent it at the point of the bayonet. This is the doctrines we hare advecated inm tbe ü'st.and a we hire said before, it is the onlr. position thi government ran take to preserve the Fed eral Constitution and tba Fedenl Govem-

A.- leadiog men, that a State has no right to I ert all the power reposed in bis hands by withdraw from the Federal Ooyercment, the Constitution to enforce the laws in soma uarcuai, wnica is oy acinowiedg- iag her independence. The GooatitulioQ prorides thtt Congress mey aduit rew states into tbe Unien, but there is no pro vision for turning one out or for permit ting one to go oat. A State once admitted in tbe Union becomes a part of the body of the nation, and severance or secession is not contemplated by the Constitution as permissable or possible. If Leegrees possesses tbe power to ac knowledge the independence of a State. nd that place it without the pale of tbe UmoQ, it must result from an inexorable necessity produced by a successful revo lution. While a State is in tbe Union there is no power under tbe Constitution for tbe general and State Governments to enter in to negotiations aoü to treat with each oth yet if one desires to. it would be better to permit her, than to reaort to coercion is, in our judgment cot tenable. That is, thirty-two States which love this Union thirty-two States that are willing to fight all the enemies of this Union come from whatever quarter they may, mast stand idly by and witness this Union dissolved by one of its own members stand listlessly by and see the key-atone track from the great arch, and all tum bling into one ccsnon rnin.

California and Oregon, being each sovereign and independent, would have right to withdraw from their pres ent partnersoip and for a new one, or form two separate cations. In doing co, they would act with a far greater show of rea son, &nd far better prospects of success, than South Carolina. They are seperated from the other States by thousands of miles of barren plains and snow-clad mountaias. Their commerce is naturally with the East Indies aud tbe isles of the Pacific ocean. The tie of commercial interests between them and the other States is weaker than that which binds together any othr sec tions of the Republic Tbe right of secession conceded and the way to do it have been shown tobe safe snd essy tie prestige of the Republic gone the National pride extinguished wi.h the National idea secession would beccme the remedy for every State cr sec tional rrievance, real or imiasrr. And n a few short years we should witness the total dissolution of that mighty Republic which bas been the hope aod the glory of the world. We should then have before us the prospect presented In tbe hitory of fe petty states ot ureecc, ttaiy ana me cii'slities of Germany. l.eed 1 stop to argue the political, mtel cannot be drawn into precedent, and Con-i strued into an admission that we are but a combination of petty States, any one of which has a right to secede and set np for herself whenever it suits her temper, or views of her peculiar interest. Such a con test, let it terminate as it may, would be a declaration to tbe other States of the only terms upon which they would be permitted to withdraw from the Union. The lopping off ef South Carelina by the sword of revolution would not disturb the unity of the ballanee ef tbe nation; but would simply be a diminution from its ag gregate power to the the extent of her re sources and population. Notwitbatandng the American revolution terminated so disastrouily to the British Government, ar ter an enormous expenditure .of blood and treasures, accompanied by such humilia tion of tho national pride, still it preserv ed the integrity of tha remaining portion of the Empire. Had our elaisas to inde pendence been at oucs recognized and con ceded by the mother country, and the thir teen colonies reaciblv allowed to consti tute a separate Qovrnaent, and take their place among the nations of the earth, an example would have bren set and an ad mission made of which every colony, is land and dependency of the emp:rj wonM have apeeusly claimed tha b.i-nt. the Caoadies.the Eat and West Indies and Australia would in tern, noint to this CO och in British historr as a palpable and unconditional avowal of the doctrine tuai they had the right under the British Uu- stitution at any time peaceably to'terromate their allegiance to tba crowu, and fced from the Empire.

Seven years is but a day i the Ii' of a nation, and I would rather come out of a atroesle at the end of that time, defeated in arms and conceding independence to successful resolution, than, t purchase present peace by tbe concession of a prin cinle that must iaevitably explode this nation into small dishonored fragments. But of the result of such a struggle, I should entertain tbe utmost hope and confidence. He who compares our glorious war for libertv and independence against crind- ioeopuresaion to another war to be set on foot for tha nrorjasation of human slavery. to crush oat liberty of speech and of the nrrss. and to inaugurate and revive with with all its untold and indescribable bor rora the African slave trade must bare an indifferent idea of tho justice of that Providence who holds in his band the is sue of b'ttles.

The hole queion is suroed up in this proposition : "Are we OV.ft nation one people, or thirty three nations, or thirtv-three independent and petty atat-? The statement of the propo3iliotS famish es the answer. II we are one nation, men no Stato has a riht to secede. Secession can only be the result of f uecessful rer- lutioa.

After the conclusion of Judge Morton's speech a paper was handed to him, 0 wbicb the following is a copy : This le understood to be a meeting to rejoice orer the election of Abraham Lin- Oiln. Will the Speaker pleasa state to bis au dience 1. Whether or not his party rejoice over the univerxal bankruptcy aud ruin now abent to fall upon our country, as a conse quence of that election .

Whether they rejoice at the prospect of fraternal strife and internecine war, which now presents itself, in the immedi ate future, as a consequence of the election 4. Whether they rejoice in the humilia tion of being compelled, by the exigencies of the limes, to accept the very principle announced and maintained by Stephen A Douglas (whom they have denounced and vilhäed for bis steadfast advocacy of it. ) as the only basis cf Union ar.d peace here after ; or, on the other hand, whether tb.ey rejoice in tbe certainly that the hones, ad herenee to their own principles an-i doc trines, will assure the speedy destruction of thoir country, and demonstrate the fail ure of Republican governments to tho world.

He has no principle, lie slsrt edoutin 1854 with something like Popu lar Sovereignty and bas ended by admit ting the doctrine that slsve property stands upon the same footing with all other prop erty. Thie doctrine will carry slavery in to all States and Territories in defiance ef the people and Popular Sovereignty. To the second branch of tbe question I answer that we have not "vilified" Ste phen A. Douglas for his "steadfast advo cacy" of a principle or for any other cause. He has becu upon all sides of the Vexed question. Within the last twelvemonth he has undergone more changes than the moon. He bas advocated notbin stead fastly but Stephen A. Douglas. To the third and last branch of the ques tion I answer that we do not reiaice in the certainty that an honest adherence to our principles "will assure the sneed r destruc tion of our country aud demonstrate tbe isiiure ot ltepublican Government to the world." On the contrary we believu our principles to be those of the Constitution and the Fathers, aod that pesce can ba on ly restored aud the alety of onr institu lions secured, by bringing back the Gor- errmeitt, to that ancieut, just aod liberal po.ury tipou which it was founded, and ad- min red tor so matiy years ,t , vailed previous to the Speaker taking the 23 years, both by the press and tbe people. chair at noon aod calling the House to and asserting that the time of Congress is order.

If the people of the othr Svjihrru States will not permit lk" enforceim nt of tbe laws in South Carolin, it wuu!d be evidence that they were intending to fal low her example at their own convenience. If they intend to stay in th Union, aod adhere to its fortunes, they will thrut no obs taele ia the way of the Gencrrsl Govern ment to prevent its cornpellisg obedionce to tbe laws.

But if such is their par pose, and such the condition of pubiis sen timent, we cannot know the fact !oj soou, that we may prtpare for the worst. 1 am not willing to believe that the bad exam ple of South Carolioa would be followed by any other State-certainly by nol more than one or two. If South Carolina get4 out of the Union, I trust it wilt be at the poiat of the bayonet, after our best efforts have failed to compel ber to submisHiou to the lawa.

R.J.Ryan I beg leave to ask a ques tion. I agree and endorse uearly every, thing that has been said here to-night, and I , too, trast that if South Carolina gets out of the Union it will be the point of the bayonet. My father and mother are buri ed at Barowell iu that State, snr1 shu'il I she secede from the Union, 1 would go aod with my own hands d g up their bones and bring thern away. Uut the question I desire to ssk is: Whether those questions were really prepared by a Democrat? Much confusion and excitement ensued fur a moment, when Mr. Tsnoer arose in the bck portion of the audience aad said the questions were his and bore his signs ture. Mr. ',Morton theu proceeded: I am not surprised that my friend, Mr. Ryan, who ia a very sensible gentleman, should regard it as incredible that any Democrat should ssk these jquestions. - The fourth question as yon perceive, is quite lengthy, and haaa very considerable stump speech injected into ihe body of it. My friend, Got. Lane, understands par liamentary law, aud I appeal to him whether 1 may not eall for a division of the qieition and cousiJer it by sections. (Gov. Laae, who was sitting on the plat form, announced that the suggestion was is order.) To the first brsnch of the ques tion 1 answer by denying that we iccept or ecessieu.; There is, to our mind, new, but o thing left, by which thil government can be prrnewd intact, and that is that the President of the United States, today, in his Ucesasje to Congress,. takes decided mi pttfv grounds against uroeiMar, If If ill üothU, the treasonable atmos phere which now lowers along the South- era horiaen will be dispelled, snd if ha does mi, S.mih Carolina and perhaps Georgia, will secede.

As a counterpoise to the exciting and evidently cxagerated news from the Uorder, wcsll attention to the following, from a reliable gentleman of Lawrence. His dec larations are corroborated fully by the offi cial report of a special messenger from the Missouri army. When the truth of history shall be written, it will be found that these siting rnmors are only a part of the pro gi -mme cono-ted by the Democracy for the dissolu ioo of the Union.

It ought to be remem bered, however, that for these acta of oth- era neither Gongreaa or any President can justly be held responsible; having been passed in violation of the Federal Contti- to tion, tbey are therefore null and void. It will be the duty of the ueit rreaidect, as it has been my own, to act with vigor in executing the Fugitive Slave Lw against conflicting enactments of State Legislatures. We are not to presume in advance that he will violate his duty, which would be at war with every princi ple of justice. Let us wait for the overt - . . act. The Fog-itire Slave Law has been carried into execution in every eon tested Case Since the commencement of tbe present administration. Let ns trust thai?' the State Legislatures will repeal their uncon stitutional and obnoxious enactments. Unless this shall be done jtithout enneees sary delay, it is impossible for any human power to save the Union; and the South ern States have a right to demand this act of justice from tbe Northern States. Should tbis'.be refused, the injured States , after b aviog first used all peaceful meaua to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Govern ment of the Union. The alleged principle that as each State became a party to tho Union by the vote of its own people acs bled in Convention, so any one of them may retire from the Union in a similar manner by the vote of such a Convention is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the Federal Constitution.

Prav er wan offered by the Chaplain. lr Biglcr in behalf of the committee to wait on tho President, reported that it had perfected Its duty. The President's Mttsae was delivered by A J. Olosbrenner, his private Secre tary. The Message was received by the House. 

HOUSK. The President's ilessage was laid before t.hr House and read by Colonel Forney, parties. The President enumerates the powers conferred on Congress by the Federsl Gov ernment, snd thst these powers msy be ef fectnal. It also possesses exelaseve right to lay and eolleet all import dutiea aad other taxes, and hss adopted effetual means to restrain the Slates from inter fering. In order still further to secure the nnin terrnp'fd exercise cf tbe high pnwer ngainst State interposition, it is provi ded that this Constitution and the laws ef the Ueited States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall bo made uiider the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby anything io tho Constitution, or law of any State or Territority to the contrary. Notwithstand ing. The Gevermeni created by the Can etitutiouand deriving its authority from the sovereign peepleof each of the seversl States, has precisely the same right to exercise Aftfer alluding lo'tha great commercial , ;t, power 0Tfr the peppi, r ,n lIlcM agricultural and other loaterial prosperi ties of the country, ihe Preside ot asks why is it tb i ihsi discontent now so extea sively prevsils, and the Union of tbe Stales, which is the source of all blessings, is threnter.ed with destruction' The long continued and intemperate intcrfVrenceof States in tbe enumerated rates, each one of them posies over subjects n-jt doleg. ted io the United States, but reserved to the States respectively or to the people to the extent of the delegaed powers. Th Uonslitutien of the United States is as much a nart of tha Constitution t the Northern people with ,h question of guu . M h people as though it had beer textuslly inserted Slavciy in the Southern States has at length produced its nalnral effect. The different eclions of the Uiion are now arrayed against each other, and the time has arrived much dreaded by the Father oi his Country, when hostile geographical psrtios have been formed till continues to be collected as heretofore at the Custom Honse at Charleston. Should the Collector unfortunately tesign, a suc cessor msy be appointed to perform this duty. It is not believed thst any at tempt will be rasue te expel the Uni ted States from its properly there by force, but if in this I should prove to be mistaken, the officers incommaod of the Forte have received orders to act strictly n tbe defensive in auch a contingency, the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the beads of tbe as sailants. In reference to recognising a se red in Stale as an Independent Govern meal by the President, he says, it would be a nnkeJ act of usurpation on bis part, and it is bis daty to submit to Congress the whole question in ell its bearings. The probability of any emergency arising when Coogresa will be called oo to decide the question whether it possesses power to compel a Stale to remain in the Union authorises him to express tbe opinion, that do such power baa been delegated bv Congress or any other department of tbe federal government. It is manifest that this .is not among tbe specific and enume rated p0We granted to Congress and it is equally apparent thft its exercise is not necessary aad proper ir earrrica- into xeeoliuu aoy cue of th'poweri. Tbe President declares lb at to snake war npoi a State is at variance with the spirit f the Constitution, and after having con quered a State, how ere we to prwo im it? Wc could not gowa it ly despotic power, nor could we by pbysical force compel its people to elect a. senator and represents- j lire and perform all other duties apper taining to an independent Stale. The fact is, that our Ynion rests upon public opin ion and can never be cemented by the blood of ita citizens shed in civil war; if it cannot lire in the affections of the people it must one day perish. Congress posses ses many means of preserving it by con ciliation, but the sword is uot placed in their bands to preserve it by force. Bat may I be permitted solemnly to ia voice my couutrymea to pause and delibe rate before they determine to destroy this, the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom aince the world began. It has been consecrated by the blood of our fathers, by the glories of the past aud by the hopes of the future. TheUniot has already made us the most prosperous, snd ere long will, if preserved, render us tbe most powerful nation on the face of the earth. In every foreign region of the globe tbe title of American citisen ia held in the highest respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land, it causes the hearts of aur countrymeu to swell with honest pride. Surely when we pass the blink of the yawning abyss we shall recoil with horror from the fatal plonge; by such a dread catastrephe tLe hepes of the friends of freedom throughout Ike world would be destroyed, and a long night of leaden des potism would enshroud the natioua. Out example for more than SO years would not only b lost, but it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for "elf government. - The slavery question, like everything homsn, will have its day. 1 firmly believe Ihm it has already reached and passed the culminating point; b..t if in tbe midst of tLe txi6ting excitement the Union shal perish, the evil may then become irrepara ble. Congress can contribute much te avert it by proposing and recommending to the Legislatures ef Ihe seversl Stalea the rem edy for existing evils which Ihe Constitu tion has itself provided fer ita own preser vation. Tbe President proposes that his ex planatory amendment to the Constitution be adopted by Congress for the final set tlement of the true construction of the Constitution on three special points:-An express recognition of the right ef property iu slaves in the Slates where it now exists or msy hereafter exist; the duly of protect ing this right in all the common territories thiougbout their territorial existence and until they shall be admitted as States into the Union with or without slavery , as their Constitutions may prescribe; a like cogni tion of the right ol the master to have his slsve who hss eicaped from one State to another restored ana delivered up to him; nele nin's Address I o lsere.
