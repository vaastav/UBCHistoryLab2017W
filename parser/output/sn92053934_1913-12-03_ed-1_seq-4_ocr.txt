Since time out of memory advo cates of the protective tariff system have contended that with lower tariff duties there would come decline in our export trade. James G. Blaine argued that low- tariffs would result la an outflow of gold from the coun try and an inflow of goods produced by pauper labor Into the country. Les lie M. Shaw was alone In declaring that high tariffs should be maintained to enable the trusts to enlarge their .foreign trade, selling under cost abroad where necessary and making .' up the deficit In enlarged profits on domestic business. The department of commerce report dealing with the foreign trade shows that during October1 the first month of operation under the new tariff law exports of American-made goods were larger than in any preceding month. November of 1912 excepted. The report groups the first three days of October with September, leaving - the nominal October figures to cover only Imports under the new tariff act. beginning Oct. 4. The actual September Imports were SI 1.000.000 more than October and ' $15,000,000 beyond September of last year, while those of October were $21,000,000 short of October, -1912. '- Duty-free Imports rose from 52 per cent In October. 1911. to 61 per cent in October. 1911. but the new leglsla- tion seems to have caused scarcely a j rlfple- The -total gli no eviltLxal ea of shipment delayed to coma la under the new rates. The full years' excess of exports, $766,000,000, is the greatest in our his tory. That of the corresponding year 1907-8. after the panic, waa 9710,000. 000; that of the Steal year 1898. when Europe was first alarmed at the "American invasion," S61S.000.000. If ret exports of gold and silver be added to last year's merchandise bal ance the total excess reaches JS06.- 000,000. This much exceeds the best estimates of our exchange require ments. DR. MOVrElfORI'l VISIT. Americans are soon to hare an op portunity to see and bear Dr. Maria Montessori, the famous Italian teacher, and observe for themselves her much discussed methods of teaching young children. Madame Montessoti arrives In this country today, to give a series of lectures on the work of her schools In Rome. She is accom panled by an interpreter, in order to be able to use her native Italian. She is bringing with her moving pictures illustrative of the work as It is actu ally carried on in the "House of Child hood." Madame Montessorl's tour will be under the auspices of the Montessori Educational Association of America, of which Mrs. Alexander Graham Bell is president. Dr. P. P. Claxton. United States commissioner of education, first vice president, and Colonel McClure of New York second vice president. Miss Margaret Wilson, daughter of the president, is a member of the board of trustees of the association, and will be active in the reception to be ac corded to Dr. Montessori at the na tional capital. Dr. Montessori will be in the United States about three weeks. She will visit eight or ten cities east of the Mississippi, beginning with Washing ton, which is the headquarters of the Montessori association. She does not expect to be able to go very far south or west on this trip. 

TIIR PREIDEn MESSAGE. President Wilson's Innovation of personally delivering his communica tions to congress has struck the popu lar chord and the biggest people in Washington scramble for places to hear the nation's chief. Another and welcome innovation is the fact that the president has abolished marathon writing. Messages are no longer 23, 000 words long, filling an entire news paper unloading dry statistics. The routine stuff is wisely left to the print ed reports of the department heads. Indeed the president announced that he would deal with legislation concern ing trusts in a special message a little later. He has discovered one of the ways of grasping and holding the attention of congress and the people by not befuddling them with a flux of words. The president was vigorously applaud ed yesterday in his demand for direct nomination of presidential candidates by vote of the people and without the intervc ntlon of convertions. "Step by step" the independence of the Philippines will b: brought about, indicating that no sweeping action is on the program for the Immediate fu ture. The farmer was made the subject of the longest chapter of the message, the president holding that our greatest industry, agriculture, has been the one most neglected by the government, in the matter of provid ing an adequate ysrem of credits and the extension of scientific methods, but h sees the dawn of a new era in that direction. Huerta. the usurping president of Mexico, knows that the American ex ecutive has him in mind. The message was in the president's well known direct, terse and unequiv ocal htyle. and in view of its brevity and clarity will probably have wider reading than any annual message in many years.

POLICY. Henry Lane Wilson, ambassador- , t'nat.nai to Mexico, and who Is now ruDninK aroUnd trying to thrust pins jn the Wilson administration, recently said to a Washington audience: "The final result of the present Mexican policy will be to involve this country in a responsibility for the kind of rule existing between the Rio Grande and the canal." The New York World answers: If that is rot the president's precise purpose, he has written and spoken many times in vain. The canal Itself is no more a fact than the determination of this ad ministration to safeguard It against foreign aggression and domestic disorder. There will be no safety for the canal while conditions between the Rio Grande and the Isthmus are such as to Invite conspiracies on the part of Big Business, revo lutionists and usurpations by cut throats financed by Big Business, and possible intervention on the part of European governments that cooperate with Big Business. Instead of being a dreamer, an idealist and a theorist advancing a scholastic and unpracticable morality, the president is plainly ana simply, tot very powerfully, emphasising the fact that govern ment by concessionaries and gov ernment by desperadoes parading themselves as dictators are not to be tolerated on this continent. There has been no shirking of re sponsibility on bis part. We may readily admit that this policy Involves a moral Idea, and that for the moment It is sup ported only by moral suasion; but. like every other correct idea. It has force behind It and will pre vail. New York Jean Millon. chef at the Riti-Carlton hotel, was Indicted for violation of the contract labor law In hiring eighty cooks through agen's In France.

The house cf representatives debat ed it, and amendments were made, the bill being supported by many repub licans on its passage. The senate banking committee con ducted hearings for nearly two months, submitting to the senate a report of over 3.2O0 printed pages. The senate democratic caucus de bated it. Finally it is In the senate for action, and the democrats insist that no more than three weeks debate is necessary. It must then go to conference to reconcile the house bill to the senate amendments. The conference report must be adopted by both houses after debate. Finally the president will study it before signing it. "It is impossible for anyone to con tend that the congress of the United States has not given this matter the most infinite pains and considerate care," 6a!d Owen. Wall street does not want the bill passed . It will take a great volume of national bank reserves out of the spec ulative market and distribute them about the country, where they are need ed for legitimate Industrial expansion. Of course, every day these reserves are permitted to remain in Wall street means fortunes for those in control of the money trust. And hence the dila tory tactics that have been practiced by certain republicans in the senate and the outcry against democratic haste.

( '- Z 7S ml The Daily .Story j JANE GRAY'S CHRISTMAS BY LILLIAN WENTZ. Copyrighted. 1911. by Associated Literary Bureau. Jane Gray looked with contemptuous eyes around the small sitting room of the little cottage which was her only borne now that the Blandford knitting mills bad failed and her shares of stock were entirely worthless. "It will be the loneliest Christmas you ever spent. Jane Gray," she said to her grim reflection In the mirror that seemed all too large for the small room. The mirror was handsome, like the other furniture that had come from the big house on the bill where Jane had lived so many years in afflu ence because of ber large holdings in the knitting mills. A knock sounded at the kitchen door, and it was Instantly followed by the opening of the door and the sound of stamping feet in the next room. "It's only me. Jane," sang the cheery voice of Mrs. Lew Moore. "What you doing, Jane?" "Nothing," said Jane drearily. "Nothing? You lucky girl:" "Lucky:" groaned Jane. "Of course," said Mrs. Moore briskly as she sat down in a rocking chair and drew out some crocheting "of course you wouldn't be sitting here doing nothing if your Christmas presents wasn't all done. Here's Christmas only three days off and I've got these table mats to finish for Rose Blair and three aprons to make for Cousin Thoebe." "Christmas presents !" repeated Jane, blushing deeply. "I don't suppose you realize, Mary, that I can't afford to give any presents this year." "Not any?" echoed Mrs. Moore rather blankly. Jane shook her head impatiently. "How can I when I've got just money enough to buy my bread and butter? As for clothes well, I guess I'll have to wear my old clothes for years to come." Mary laughed heartlessly. "You've always bad so many handsome clothes, Jane, that you ought to be glad there's "THERE'S NOTHIKQ TO BAT EXCEPT TES!" a chance you can wear some of 'em out really wear 'em out! I've seen you put away good clothes every year that made my mouth water, and I ex pect the Lord was prompting you to put 'em by for this rainy day that's come upon you. I'll tell you frankly, Jane, it made me sick when I saw you put away two perfectly good seal cloaks when your sister died." "Why?" asked Jane. "Because I'd wanted a seal clonk for years, and I've tried and tried to save up for one, but something always hap pened to take the money before I could spend it something really necessary, like sickness. Now, you. Jane, have got this store of" clothes to fall back on. You ought to be thankful. Get 'era out and make 'em over, and you'll still be the best dressed woman In Blandford." "Clothes aren't worrying me so much row, Mary," she confessed. "It's the fact that I can't give any nice presents tills year." "Very well. If you can't buy new things and you haven't got time to make anything now, it's so late why don't you give what you've got?" "Give what I've got? I don't under stand." "Haven't you got a lot of extra fur niture stored in the carriage house out here?" asked Mary, with animation. "Of course I have. There were so many heirloom and so little room in the cottage here I had to find a place for them." "Well, why don't you give some of the things away this Christmas to some of the people who'd be pleased to death to have 'em? "But I'm not through with tbem. I like to feel that they belong to me," protested Jane weakly. Mary darted a glance of ntempt at ber friend. "You've surely got the Christmas spirit!" she sniffed. "Don't you sup Kse I'd rather have the time I'ni pending on these plagued table mats for reading or visiting or something agreeable? It's the same way with ill the presents I'm making. It's sac rifice, sucrlfice, time ana strengto and inclluatious. But I don't begrudge it," she ended, smiling softly. Jaue swallowed a lump in her throat. "'Tain't what, you give nor how much you give that counts," said Mary In a low voice. "It's the feeling that goes with it." Jane Gray was silent for a long time. The sun dropped behind the most dis tant peak, and twilight fell in the lit tle room. "Cousin Amelia Sturgls always want ed the four rush bottomed chairs," said Jane suddenly. "I've got two seta of them, yon know." "I remember. Why don't you give "em to her?" "I guess I will. And Belle Sturgls said shejd dlo happy if she could hate some of her great-grandmother's old bedquilts." "Give her some." "I will." decided Jane. "And Sarah Smjth can have the cherry table, and Elsie Finch wants a clothes hamper. I've got two. Then Elsie's husband would set store by father' s saddle. I'll send that to him. You know, he's fond of riding that mare be raised. Then there's an old blue teapot that belonged to my great-aunt Flora. Why. Mary Moore. I do believe I could fit out the whole family with tblnsr they want! One of Dora's girls would llko taut wine- colored velvet I used to wenr. She could make it over for this winter." "Isn't it great?" cried Mary enthusi astically. "And then after yon've tied up all the things I'll have Lew brinjr the box wagon around, and he can cart your presents around to all the folks. And then you can have a big Christmas dinner and invite them all to come." "Christmas dinner: Mary Moore, I can't afford to buy a turkey for my self:" "Has any one invited you to dinner yet?" "Yes. every one of them, but some how it hurts me to go." "Foolish Jane!" laughed Mary ten derly. "Now. listen to me. You told me you had 400 cans of fruit and pre serves in your cellar that you brought from the big house. Well, you know I wss sick last summer, and I didn't put up a speck of fruit. I'll make a trndo with you. Give me some canned fruit and I'll sell you one of our biggest turkeys, and I'll make you a plum pud ding and some pies, and you can trad" out all the vegetables you want. What say?" "Mary, there's nothing to say except 'yes!" cried Jane tearfully. "I have a feeling this is going to bo a wonder ful Christmas." "I've no doubt It will be the happiest one you ever spent." said Mary as she folded up her work. "I'll come over In the morning, and we'll plan out tho whole thing." It was certainly the happiest Christ mas Jane Gray had known since her childhood. It is one thing to set out to do Christmas shopping with a well filled purse and a fine disregard of tho price of things, and it is another and more pleasurable thing to go over one's belongings and select things that will directly appeal to the henrt of the re cipient. If the giving Implies a sacri fice on the part of the donor tho gift Is the more blessed. Jane smiled happily as she pulled out the carefully preserved articles of furniture from the carrlugo house and wrapped them up in gay papers, and the searching through her twenty trunks was like straying through for gotten chambers of her memory. There were pretty fans and laces and quaint trinkets and bits of jewelry to gladden the hearts of the girls and their mothers, old fashioned books and toys for the children, and for the men folks there were books and interesting curios from the collection of her fa ther, a retired sea captain. And all the relations who had feared to give very much to rich Jane Gray because it might be Interpreted as a desire to seek favor with her gave lavishly from their grateful hearts on this particular Christmas day. And each one accepted Jane's invitation t dinner until the little house was over flowing with merriment and good cheer. They set two tables, one in the dining room for the grownups and another In the sitting room for the chil dren, and when the delicious meal was over they nil declared it was llio hap piest Christmas they hod ever known. "Seems as if we love each other moro this Christmas." said little Sammy Finch wisely, and tho elders all smiled at each other. The young girls who had always feared Jane a little gath ered about her and kissed her for the pretty old fashioned gowns she had given them to make over, and Jane recognized that wnrm glow that Mary Moore had described ns the right Christmas spirit "Seems as If I'd Just learned how to be happy," sighed Jaue as she watched the last sleigh drive away under I he Ch.-istmas stars. A dark form came scudding through the knowy orchard that divided Jane's cottage from Mary Moore's house. It wi:s Mary Moore coming to cry on Jane's shoulder and tell her how happy she was because she had found the long dos.'red seal clonk among her Christmas gifiv Jane felt a pang of remorse because she had not given It before. But later, when she Mew out her can dle, she stood In her window and look ed out at the soft radiance of the win ter night. "I thought this cottage was small." she mused, "but it Is much larger than the big house, because it has held nn mnch more happiness tonight. It was full to overflowing. I guess there's enough to last me the whole year, and It's taught me that giving alone ain't all.
