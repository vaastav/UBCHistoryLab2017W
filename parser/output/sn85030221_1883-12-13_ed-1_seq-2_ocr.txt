New York Sun : Within the last two ! weeks the strangr red glow In the Vy , afutr aaa net and In-fore sunrise wbich at tracted so much attention hureliusl week . baa boea witnessed acros tu whole North American continent, from Call- . lornia to Kaioc. TUc phenomenon set in 9 to bans been first keen on the Pacific . coast on I be evening of Not. 30, and In j dan Francisco, lust as In New Yoik, I wNk later.pi-oplc believed that tbt light , wai duo to a crcat conflagration. It is a 'curious fact that while the dates of the I appearance of this phenomenon ai dif ferent places In the united Btaus are inch as to suggest that It advanced from : west to cast across the continent, it was seen in England as early as Not. 0. The i Tarlous descriptions given leave no doubt that the strange illuminations be ' heUI in England were of the same nv tare as those witnessed here. Besides, although the most conspicuous features of the display here was the red .color of the heavens, yet other peculiar optical effects were perceived which suggest a close resemblance in many respects bet wee this phenomenon and the green sun and i s accompanying appearances, seen in India and South America in Heptember. The explana tion offered of the strange color of the iky in India, namely, that it was caused by vapors emitted by the J ay an volca. anes in their great eruption at the end :"f August, see mod reasonable enough; i but there were great difficulties in the way of the acceptance of the same ex- pi an all on of the South American phe ; aomenoo, one oi the chief of which was -ha fact that the snn appeared green in South America before it did in India. Nevertheless, the phenomena in the two -.nun tries were so similar that it was aatural to ascribe them to a similar ori gin, and evidences of a volcanic out burst in South America like that in Java were sought for. Hut it now ap pears that no such disturbance' has oo -urred in South America, f The likeness between the recent son wt and sunrise phenomena here and the tppearaoces In South America and India ost described also suggests a common, r at least a similar .cause. The sugges tion that this cause may be the pres ence of meteoric dust in the atmosphere leems to fit all the circumstances better .han any explanation yet offered, al hough it, too, encounters difficulties, rhe earth has within the last three vecks crossed the tracks of two meteor itrcams, and the number of brilliant neteon seen recently has been such as 0 attract special attention from obserr-' irs of the henvens. These metnors hsve learly all left long trails in their Uight, uul the latest investigations; show that hese meteor trails are only incandescent lust or vapor, like that uto which the neteors themselves are entirely convert Ajinleas, as occasionally happens, they .trlke the earth before being completely 'onsumed. On Thursday night a very remarkable meteor ot this kind was ecn in this city, and the observation by ftoL Brooks on Wednesday evening of 1 wonderful shower of telescopic meteors .tdds to the mass ol evidence that the uarth has just been passing through a pgion rich In these cosmic particles, jhlch, falling under Its attraction, have plunged into the atmosphere in great numbers. 1 The suggestion has also been offered pat the supposed meteoric matter may Wiethe debris of the famous comet of iilela, which many years ago split in two and afterward disappeared, leaving :uo trace of Itself except a brilliant swarm ht meteors, which came dashing out of he northern sky on the track of the lost hornet in 1372. The earth crossed the vwblt ot this comet, which is believed to have been converted into a mass ol me teors, on last Tuesday, the very day on which the most brilliant sunset specta cle was beheld here. At first sight this Incidence in time seems to lend stroDg support to the suggestion that the re mains ot Bella's comet furnished the meteoric matter from which the sun's rays were reflected in the higher regions if the atmosphere. But the apparent confirmation disappears when it "a , recollected that in California ' he same appearance was pre tented a week, and in England more than wo weeks, bctore the earth reached the comet's path. Moreover, the meteors teen by Prof. Brooks, and those which or several weeks have attracted attcn .Ion both in this country and in Surope, did not belong to the Blela iwarm, which always approaches from t particular point in the northern heav- -as. It appears, then, that if an unus lal quantity of meteoric dust has recent y entered our atmosphere from outer pace, it has come, not from any one of he acveral awarms of meteors which nake their appearance at regular inter 'als, but from meteors which the earth Iocs not regularly encounter, or perhaps rom a cloud of mere cosmic dust. ). Boon after the comet of 1812 was de eded returning sunward last September, t exhibited a wonderful outburst of ight, accompanied by an equally aur- wising and sudden increase of size. La- er It fadod again, and since then It has cbaved in a normal manner, and Is now ost visible to the naked eye approach ng the sun. The appearances it pre- anted in September suggested that it 'ad had a collision with some other mdy, producing a sudden flare of light ,nd expansion of volume, owing to the ieat developed. I n view of the evidence -hat the region of apace through which he earth is now advancing abounds In meteoric masses, it is a curious lueation whether, if the comet had collision, it did not run into a swarm of . neteors, The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette "e produces from its old files the follow- ng extract from a speech made by Mr. ' John G. Carllalo when a candidate for congress in 187(1. The speech was de livered at Cynthiana, Kr, October 38, 1878, and was reported wbotim. Mr. Carlisle said j I deny that the United Slates Is a na- ' lion. It is a vicious system that has i iostroyed sovereign states and oppressed ! nine millions ot people in the south. If i a state has no right of secession, she J -crtainlv has the right of revolution, ' The Republican party - wants another amendment to tho constitution. ' Why Jo they want in is it not that tne gov. eminent shall take the school fund into ; its own hands, and appoint a commia aioner who shall select the teachers and series of books to . be used in the schools, and your child and my ' child be denied the right to learn the alphabet except in snch a book as shall teach them to ioreot Washington. Jack. on. Jefferson, and the statesmen of Vir ginia and the South? But the day will come when South Carolina will, under Democratic rule, take her place beside i Virginia and other sovereign states, and i rid herself of the barbarous political " buzzards of the Nortn that have ted on ' her carcass for the last eleven ywars, and i robbed white and black without dis- ! crimination. 1 No fewer than 10,070 bills and resolu tioos were introduced into the Forty. seventh Congress, and only few hun dred ot them actually passed. If the Forty-eighth Congress does not wish its legislation to be encumbered and clogged with the weight of an overburdened catena dar, like Its predecessor, it should take early steps to guard against the modern tendency to carelessly and uselessly sood bout nouses with mils. Last win ter an act was passed to afford some re lief to congress and the executive de partments in the matter of investigating laans against the government. This jw will probably be of some help to ;,e present congress.

Nnltle Prentis and bis bride are makj me a very pleasant tonr. of the Kansas newspapers. Wichita is plunged in sullen g'ootn over the removal of Nelli Bailey, the murderess, to Topek. The Detroit Free Press has discover ed that it is cucajwr tor a man to murder his wife than get a divorce. We wonder who's holding down Sedg wick county while Marsh Murdoch and Judge HI ass are at Washington. It Is semi-ofllclally announced that Mr. Randall will not be the next Demr- cratic candidate for president. The Chicago Trloune apparently doesn't know whether to laugh or cry over the election of Carlisle for speaker. Sam Wood writes from Washington to a friend that he is doing as well as could be expected tinder all the circumstances St. Louis Globe-Democrat: "No, thank you," seems to be the general re sponse to Mr. Blaine's whisky proposi tion. Kansas City Times: If there are any points which the president omitted in his message, he might get out a supple, ment. The New Orleans Picayune and the Atlanta Constitution both regret Car lisle's eleotion on the ground of his free trade sentiments. It is intimated that lightning will strike in railway circles at Topeka next week if Major Hopkins, of the commis sion, Is fully recovered. Atchison Globe: "Yes," the farmer said, "barbed wire is expensive, but the hired man doesn't stop to rest every time he has to climb it." It is evident that the Rev. David N. Utter never heard "John Brown's Body Lies Mouldering in the Grave" sung by chorus of Kansas veterans. One of the many beneficent features of our Republican institutions is the fact that the president's message is al ways published after Thanksgiving. The editor of the St. Joseph Gazette, who is in Washington, telegraphs to his paper: "The Southern Confederacy is again in the saddle, and is pushing things." I A monument to the memory of Bo- ourner Truth is in order.as she was the only woman who eyer lived that had an ambition to be regarded older than she really was. Sam Wood should have taken an empty nail keg or a cracker box with him to Washington. It looks at if h were going to have some trouble In finding a seat.

A half brother of Frank James has ust been indicted for asttalt With in tent to kill . The children oi the saint ed Widow Samuels all seem to take af ter their mother. It is announced that Col. Jennison has cut looeo from the liquor association at Leavenworth. This operation must have been very similar to the amputation of Chicago girl's foot. A Chicago firm has secured the con tract for furnishing the new government building at Topeka, provided, of course that it is still in existence when the aforesaid structure is finished. The Topeka Commonwealth concedes that "onto" Is a legitimate word. It is intensely reassuring to note the possi bility of an occasional agreement beetwen Father Baker and Noah Webster. Mr. Beecher is of the opinion that the Mormon problem, if let alone, will solve itself. Mr. B. has always been more or less of an optimist when it came to the question of polygamy. John 8 peer has taken bold ot the Law. rence News and has converted it into ft morning paper. There are tew men who have seen more of the mournful vicissitudes of life than Mr. Speer. Joe Jefferson has entirely recovered his vaico. Clara Louise Kellogg should lose no time in familiarizing herself with the method ot treatment which contributed to that gratifying result. Father Baker is to read a paper before the State Horticultural society at Otta wa. He has been devoting a great deal of time to the arts of peace since the election in the Third judicial district. An exchange which givea much atten tion to such matters says tbat Alice Oates is to lugged into the courts again. This is the first intimation we have teen ot the completion of the Keeley motor. Some idea of the atrocious character oi "The Devll"a Auction" may be gained when it la known that a number of Atchison people left the house during its production at that place Tuesdsy evening. Mr. Carlisle is an out-and-out free trader, and has deep-rooted objections to spelling "nation" with ft big "N." There is nothing "incidental" about the new speaker that the public has yet dis covered. The Republican newspapers are begin ning to draw their files on the new speaker of the house of representatives. Mr- Carlisle's mouth flowed with great exuberance in Kentucky during and af ter the war. . A Kansas exchange says that an at tempt is to be made to create a second John P. St. John out of Col. Martin, of the Atchison Champion. The public will contemplate that process with fever ish interest. We have no grudge against Africa and yet we cannot forbear the aweet hope that Dare Payne will give special atten tion to that portion of the president's message which sets iorth the alluring features of the Congo valley. The resignation of Msyor Wilson, of Topeka, has stimulated a boom in the "mentioning" industry in that city. Al most every men in the town who has a second shirt to his back has been "spoken of" as a candidate to fill the vacancy. - Joe Wilson, mayor of Topeka, has re signed his office on account of ill-health to the Commonwealth states and an election has been called to fill the vacan cy. It is understood that both Father Baker add Major Hudson have ordered new and elaborate sulU of war-paint. It Is stated that the Missouri river which forms a new bed tor itself some where with every freshet, is threatening to make Leavenworth an insular city. We feared something of that kind when we learned that Col. Jennison contem prated pulling up and leaving that place. Mathew Arnold says that the moat Im portant work in verse, in our century. was aone oy rvoraswonn. it is quite apparant that Mr. Arnold has never "met up" with any of the materialized afflatus of Col. G. Washington Warder, of Kan sas City, or of T. Brower Peacock, of Topeaka. Dr. Noah Porter says that the idea that evolution is a self-generated tahrra- tion from lower to higher forms is not tenable, but that evolution under the guidance of a formulated plan of Deity is perfectly rational, and Is "a the ory, which, rightly received, brings God into our view, and justifies the pur. pose and progress of the universe.'

When it comes to death and the inexor able demands of the American judiciary all men are equal. There are still a few papers in Kan&as which have not printed the president's message or published an editorial on the "Solid South." Plutocracy has raised Its awful bead in Kansas. The Arkansas Valley Edit orial Association reports a balance of $3.60 in lis treasury. ,. The English press is not pleased with Mr. Arthur's message. The president of the United States generally writes for American consumption. : The Atchison . Globe characterizta "Fan on the Bristol" as a "clean and amusing entertainment." We wish Ed Howe had left that unsaid. Ninety members ot . the present house could not swear that they "had never borne arms against the United States or furnished aid to her enemies." "Romany Rye" continues to fill the Glllis opera bouse at Kansas City every night. "Rock, and Rye" has always drawn excellent houses at that place. It must have been trifle awkward tor Marsh Murdock when ft gentleman stepped up to him in a hotel at Wash? ington the other day and addressed him as Ell Perkins. Close upon the resignation of Joe Wil son as mayor of Topeka, Col. H. Miles Moore throws up the sponge as city at torney of Leavenworth. There seems to be room in Kansas for a few more Ohio men. The clock in the bouse of represen tatives keeps the old time. It would scarcely be in accordance with the fit ness of things to turn it forward in view of the election of a square-toed Bour bon to the office of speaker. Maud S. is said to be rapidly going to pieces as the result of too many trial heat given her by her owner, Mr. Van derbilt. When it comes to a question of soeed Alice Oates still seems to "lay it Over" all of her competitors. Khm City Times: Mr. -Arthur's messase is so smooth and unctuous, in strict harmony with the characteristics of its distinguished author, that it in dicates the president could be happy with either party, were the other for him. Col. Jennison, who was recently sr- reeted in - Leavenworth for violating the liquor law, gave a bond signed by men worth in the aggregate more than three million dollars. There is nothing like being supported by a strong public sentiment. Atchison Globe: It is only ft step from the sublime to the ridiculous. On Thursday last Noble Prentis was being congratulated on every band as ft bride groom; this morning he was quarreling with A- J. Harwl over the price of a pair of flat irons. The Champion claims that the reju venated Otis house at Atchison, when completed, will surpass in beauty, con- venlence and attractiveness any hotel west of Chicago or St. Louis. And yet there are any number ot people who scoff at the theory of evolution. Judge Tourgee says the new statue of Washington In New York is a great sue- cecs, and adds: "For the first time in my life I begin - to believe that . Wash ington actually lived.. All other repre sentations ot the first president make htm look as if he were saying 'Let us pray!" . The latest news from Europe is that Queen Victoria is excessively partial to baked apples and that King Alfonso and the crown prince ot Germany kissed each other upon the departure yesterday of the latter from . Spain. We often wonder how this country ever got along without the cable. By a curious provision of her state constitution Michigan forbids not only the employment on salary of chaplains for either house, but prohibits any form of religious services in her state legisl ture. It might not be ft bad idea for other states to "catch on" to this pointer and oblige their law makers to do their own praying. The Chicago Inter-Ocean says tbat there is really nothing in the world for congress to do but to pass the appropria tion bills and adjourn. The I-O. seems to utterly ignore the tact tbat the Demo cratic party baa a reputation to sustain for making, blunders which has been steadily growing in splendor for the past twenty-five years. Atchison Champion: John Brown. Jr., has written to the Cleveland Leader ft reply to the assault made upon his father by Rev. D. N. Utter, in the North American. He tells the whole story. which Mr. Utter Joes not He does not deny the Pottawatomie creek killings, which he styles "executions." He tells, in addition, that in the death of these men it wss a question with Brown "as to which side should "first obtain the drop." When called upon to choose between being killed by one's enemies or killing them,-no man hesitates. Patent medicines are an old invention. The oldest known is "Dutch Drops made In 169S. "Godfrey's Cordial" is a very old medicine. "Fosgates Cordial," made in Auburn, New York, in 1800, is sull sold. "Pond's Extract" has been manufactured for torty years. Lyon's "Kathatron," composed of castor oil and alcohol, was once famous. "Sterling's Ambrosia" followed. Sterling pro cured the receipt of hair wash somewhere, and then found a New York actress, who had such heavy long hajr that when falling loose on the back it resembled a black cloak This was the advertisement he wanted, and he pro cured from her an affidavit that her hair had grown to snch length and thickness after using his Ambrosia eighteen months, lie had pictures of her taken, and these and the affidavit sold his wash for ft long time.

Here are four or five books, coating his parents, or the public, under the free book system, three four, or five dollar?, which he must have if he would keep bis-place in the arith metic class. In the grammar, geography and other classes the same oystem pre vails. The scholar, during his six or eight years' course, must be provided with from four to six u-xt-books for each study pursued. Bat this system is not to be condemned because of its cost, though tbat be bur densome. Cost must not be considered when Intelligence is at stake. The mag nitude of the evil is in this fact, that be yond a certain limit, the more books a scholar has to study, the less he learns. In others, numerous text-books and frequent changes, are substituted for personal in struction by the teacher; and inevitably with bad results. If the teacher had the proper ability and opportunity, he or she could teach the scholar all tbat is to be learned in schools of arithmetic, or of. grammar, or of geography, from not more than two books to each study. Bat, with some, through iLCompetence or carelessness, with others through lack of time because of too large classes, very many teachers have become mere machines for listening to parrot-like rec itations and recordibg "marks." The scholar, made to depend entirely upon his books, must have those books chang ed every year or two, to suit his expand ing comprehension. At eight he com mits to memory the "primary;" at ten the "intermediate;" at twelve the "com mon school;" at fourteen the "grammar school at sixteen the "uni versity." From first to last he commits to memory and recites by rote; and when be gets "stuck" and asks for in formation, he Is - told, "Look at your book and see what it says ;" and gets a demerit for dullness. Authors and publishers encourage this system ; for the more books they sell the more money they make. Many teachers and school boards, acting as publshers' agents, encourage it tor the same reason. The parents who buy the books, and the children whose search for knowledge is bewildered by a multiplicity of guide books but pauc ity of guides, are the losers. If the mon ey that is wasted every year on worse than useless textbooks could be applied to hiring more ana more competent and more earnest instructors, our school sys tem would be increased in real useful ness a hundred per cent. KANSAS APPLES. We would like to know whether any thing can be prettier than the apples which the orchards of Kansas have pro duced this season. We passed a window on Commercial . street yesterday Into which a grocer had carelessly thrown a bushel of Dominies, and about as many Jonathans and Bellflowers, and he didn't know that be had rivaled in effect the most artistic display of holiday conceits In the city. The rich crimson, tSe bright gold and the delicate striping ot the respective varieties, presented a pic ture which might well have challenged the admiration of an artist.. The apple, which reaches perfection in form, color and flavor in Kan sas, is sovereign among fruits. It gratifies the senses of taste, sight and smell ; it comes with June and remains until March; it is as sociated with the bright joys of summer and the good cheer ot long winter even ings. When it "cometh forth as a flower" and ladens the sir with fragrance it is no less a thing of beauty than when, in the fall flush of its rich fruition, it min gles its splendid gold and crimson with the emerald of the foliage trora which it smiles. It has had to contend with drouth, blight and "borers" in gaining its birth right in Kansas, but to-day there is no soil which nourishes it so generously snd no skies are so kindly to its best de velopment as ours. We do not marvel that Mr. Beecher. upon the occasion of bis late visit to Kansas was so charmed with the beauty of Its apples and car ried away with him such pleasing re membrances of this latter-day Eschol in which our lines have happily fallen. THE ROSECRANS AMENDMENT. Tne announcement comes from Washington that General William S. Rosecrans in ten Is to propose in con gress an amendment to the constitution, in these words : AMKMDM KMT XVI. "Skctioh 1. Polygamy, being incom patible with our civilization, is forever prohibited In the United States and all places under its jurisdiction. "Section 2. Congress shall have pow er to enforce this by appropriate legis lation.'! The revised statutes of the United States already prohibit polygamy in any territory or other place over wbich the United States have exclusive jurisdic tion. The crime is called bigamy, al though the definition is broad enough to embrace polygamy. The supreme court has declared the law to be consti tutional, and has decided that those who make polygamy a part of their relieion are not excepted from the operation of the statute. Inasmuch, therefore, as the highest judicial tribunal in the land has' al ready expressly determined that con gress now has power to prohibit plural marriages in all places under the exclu sive domination of the United States, under the constitution as it is, we see no reason for amending the constitution as proposed by Gen. Rosecrans. There is law enough against polygamy already. The difficulty is in iu enforce, ment. St Louis Globe-Democrat: Senator Edmunds does not feel at all dishearten ed with respect to the suppression of polygamy. He has "reason to believe that the legislation already adopted is operating favorably to the end desired, and if it can be supported and supple mented by legislation which the com mittee, on the occasion of the passing of the former bill, stated they expected to bring," he has "no doubt tbat with good administration, without whichall laws are useless, we shall gradually extirpate the crime." The Senator promises to bring the supplementary bills needed before congress tnts winter. If after congress has suppressed polygamy, it will separate Mormon politics from the church, it will have settled the Mormon question, bat the latter will prove ft much mote difficult job than the former. There will be room to be thankful, how ever, if polygomy is pot down. - - - Senator Edmund's bill for the protec tion of civil rights, provides that when any material question shall arise in state court concerning any civil rights property, which shall be assailed or de nied, any such issue or question depend ing upon or aifected by race, color, or previous condition of servitude of any persons, the case may be removed to the United States circuit or district court, and where an adverse decision has beta rendered in a civil rights case in a state court, ' an appeal lies to . the United States courts. Many nice delicacies are of ten spoiled by the flavorings osad in them, and gen erally their ha vine been spoiled is at. tributed to the cook. Now if Dr. Price's Special Flavoring Extracts are used, cooks will not be blamed, nice dishes will not be spoiled, as they always im part tnetr delicate rresh fruit navor in vterer they may be used. Manitoba's authorities having averred tbat la ihuir Ury Atmosphere cold is not more severely K-lt at 36 degns below zero than it is at zero in the hnmid air of Great Britain, and that building operation are carried on ail winter iu Manitoba, a writer in the Kansas City Tiuits says: The tii r m imeter at 2 de grees below fret zing point ia England causes inure discomfort than when it is 62 degree U-Iow in Manitoba; und, in fact, the lower the thermometer goes the less is the cold felt, owing to the extra ordinary quantity or oxygen iathe air.

Ia De cember and January, when the day's ploughing is finished, the settlers are constantly in the hebit of allowing the fires to go out in the eVening, while they sit outside on the porches in the warm winter moonlight and listen to the tie lightful warbling ot the nightingale in the neighboring woods." Web Wilder has purchased the Herald at Hiawatha and merged it into the World, giving that paper a circulation of 3,000. This is a good thing for the people of Brown county. Web, Wilder can cover the whole newspaper field there and in such a way as few other men in this state could do. He writes much about Kansas things and with a degree of interest with which none of his eotemporariea invest their work un less it may be Prentis, of the Champion. We'll venture the assertion that there is not an editor in Kansas who exchang es with the World who does not know it by the wrapper, and this familiarity with any paper serves as an index to Its distinctive character and place in the newspaper world. The World, under its present management, has always been so good that we doubt whether it can be made much better, though it affords us pleasure to note that its publisher and proprietor is anchored to Kansas by an investment which will make .him a fixture in a state to which be belongs by the supreme law of natural affinity. Chicago Herald : The most stagger ing blow which the enthusiastic admir ers of Samuel J. TUden have received ia the announcement that he is preparing to turn over his Gramercy Park mansion with its costly library and rich works of art, to the city of New York. Dana and Waterson have Insisted for months that the ex-goyernor would not, under any circumstances, accept another presiden tial nomination, but the "supporters of the old ticket ides have, refused to be lieve them, holding tbat at the proper moment Mr. Tildcn would announce himself a candidate. To this class ot patriots the intelli gence that the old gentleman has begun the distribution of his worldly effects will come with crushing force. The man who is busily engaged in closing aphis earthly affairs, and presumably making bis peace with God, is certainly beyond the reach of a Democratic nomi nating convection. Unless the New York veteran can prove that he is. not giving away his valuables, the Herald fears that he will - have to be bidden a fond farewell. "Sc. Louis Globe-Democrat: Rev. Mr. Utter, of Chicago, who attempted to show, through an article in the North American Review, that the memory of John Brown should not be respected and honored, has gained a good deal of ad vertising, but he has at the same time been placed in a very unpleasant atti tude as s writer of history. The facts uoon which he relied to prove the rug ged old hero a hypocrite and a repro bate turn out to be not facts at all, but idle and malicious gossip long ago thor oughly refuted. His article has served the timely purpose, however, of renew ing interest in tho life and character of a man who died for principle's sake and love of his fellow men "and his soul goes marching on." Mr. Utter, being clergyman, will no doubt take early oc casion to acknowledge bis error and re tract the unkind things he was led to say of a noble Christian and martyr. It is to be hoped that congress will pay some attention to Secretary Teller's rec ommendation in favor of civilizing the Indians by compelling them to go to work and earn theirown living. There is more good sense in a suggestion ol that kind than in all the elaborate and profound theories that have ever been envolved fofthe solution of the Indian problem.

As to the corn crop now being gather ed there seems to be a wide difference in opinion among correspondents in the same counties, but the general tenor of the reports go to show that the crop is rully equal to mat oi mot year, inougn the quality ia many localites is below the average, and the weather has been WfaroraMe tor. drying the cob. A fea ture in this year's crop is that the up lands have yielded mncb better than ever, while the bottom lands in many eonnties have not done as well. This is due. no doubt, to the wet spring sad coa sequent late planting. Of swine there seems to be an abundant supply, both of r.r hnM ml feeders, and the nrosoect is good for a full supply in this market for the entire winter pacamg acaaop.
