CHINESE AND THE OLD LAW Nf Poon Chew Tails af tha FUbi Hit Countrjmei Hare Laid. HOPE TO BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS .Nun I'miicliico ICilItor Hxprrnurn Sttr- lirlxr ut the Mtuiillnn mill (itiur n ut cm HIn Countrymen Will .ot AViirrnnt ICxclufilon. Nr Toon Chow, editor of tho Chung Snl Vat I'o, published In San Francisco, will Iccturo nt the First l'resbyterlan church tonight on "Tho CHbIb in China from tho Stnmlpolnt ot a Chlnamnn." Nk Toon Chow has resided In tho United States for twenty-ono years nnd Is a grad uate of tho San Francisco Theological sem inary. For tho last two years ho has been tho mnnaglng editor ot tho Chung Sal Yat Po, tho first Chinese paper published In tho United States nnd tho largest and moat Influential. Tho Christmas number con tains many elegant pictures of tho manag lng alitor, his staff, the Chinese consul and tho Chlneso emperor. Kdltor Chow, is en thuslustlc over his papor, and while It Is difficult for nn American to rend, It Is cer tainly n thing of beauty. "Our paper," said tho editor, "of course circulates only among tho Chlneso. Whllo wo have only about 0,000 subscribers, we consider that good for tho number of peo plo wo enn reach. You will bo surprised to lenrn that tho troublo In South America has effected our circulation. Wo have many progrexfllvo Chinamen In Colon, nnd bo cnuso of tho war twenty-flvo of our renders hnvo requested their papers discontinued as thoy havo becomo impoverished by tho troublo. Tho Chung Sal Yat I'o readers In tho United States pay $6 per year for the paper; outsldo ot this country tho subscrlp tlon prlco Is $8 per yenr. "Wo Chlneso think you Americans are .queer people," continued tho editor. "Wo don't know why tho Chlneso exclusion act should bo re-enacted. You aro surely not afraid that too many Chlneso will come hero. At tho present tlmo there aro not moro thnn 70,000 Chinese In this country. During tho twenty-flvo years when thoro wns no restriction placed on Chlneso enunt gratlon thoro was never a tlmo when thero wcro moro than 150,000. Peoplo who come from my country aro tho progressive class. Thoy come to lenrn your ways and become educated. Thoy aro a lawabldlng and law loving class. Only tho dark eldo of tho Chinese people has been, shown to tho masses ot the peoplo. Tho fight ngalnst us Is caused nnd carried on by tho politicians nnd the labor unions. Wo aro In a falss light. "For Instnnce, during tho Epworth league convention In San Francisco guides em ployed by tho politicians nnd others piloted the visitors to what they called tho Chl neso quarters and showed them" tho Chines smoking opium. The truth Is theso quarters wero rented by politicians and theso Chlnost wero paid to go thero and smoko and live In filth that tho visitors would go home and tell of tho horrors of tho Chinese quar ters. . "The Six Companies you hear so much about Is also misrepresented. This Is nn organization formed by tho Chinese ot six districts of China. Its object Is bonevolent. Wo tako caro of our sick nnd sond homo our dead. Wo aro assessed nothing until ono member desires to return to China, and then ho pays $10. We havo requested every Chinese In tho country to contribute something In order that we can fight the re-enactment of tho Chlneso exclusion net, or to got It modified. Many of us here would Uko to bring our families over, our wives and children. At present wo cannot. We want tho United States and our gov ernment If the formor docBn't want us to mako some kind of a treaty. It Is to your Interest ub well ns ours. China Is the market for American products. Wo aro waking up nnd progress Is our watchword. Wo want to become citizens. I havo been hero twenty-one years, but cannot vote, nnd yet European cmmlgrants aro allowed to vote after a certain number of years with out regard to charactor. We bring no an archists here; wo bring no nihilists, Tho Chlneso will make good, true, honest citi zens. If. ever we got a vote, then the good and, bright side of the Chlneso will be shown nnd the fight on us by politicians will cease. Many peoplo In California are now petitioning their congressmen to work for the removal of tho restriction of Cal uese cmmlgratlon." Tito Children Itrnciirtl.
