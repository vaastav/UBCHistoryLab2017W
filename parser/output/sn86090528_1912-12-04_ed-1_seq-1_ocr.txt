The terms of the franchise with the Big Horizon Oil and Gas company pledges the company to have gas pip er into Chic-kasha and ready for use within eight months from yesterday, but according to statements of the gas company's officials, natural gas will have ceased to be a novelty by that time and will havo become a fix ture with Chickasha people. The work it: to bo pushed to the limit and the pipe line will be laid into Chickasha at the earliest possible moment. Prac tically the only obstacle that will de laj the construction work is the trou ble incurred In the transportation of material from eastern points. When seen this morning, Mr. O'llara o' the Big Horizon Oil and Gas com pany said, "We have already encoun tered considerable trouble in getting out supplies and piping promptly and are inclined to believe that this trou ble will continue, owing to car short age of the transportation companies. Our franchise requires that we have gas piped into C'hickasha within eight months from December .", but I am almost tempted to promise it within 7". days from yesterday. At any rate, we will ilave the line completed and will be selling gas in Chit-kasha just as soon as possible. Every effort will be exerted to have the line completed within three months. The work construction will start at once." of KAFIR SPECIAl GOING SOME That the fanners of Oklahoma are deeply interested In the ' kal'ir corn "uplift" was again demonstrated yes terday w hen,, despite heavy reads, due t- copious rainfall, large crowds at ti ruled the lectures from the special train at every stop, so says an Alva telegram.

After two hours of wran gling and many roll calls this morn ing, by vote of IT to 11), it was de cided by the senate that all commit tees should be elected by the entire senate.
