Unlike some other papers, we have no campaign fund at our backs to enable GOOD NEWS. HNarly one-third of our edition has now been printed, but we stop the press to get in the following telegram, which arrived too late to get in our entire' edi tion: "Hillsboro, N. O. Dec. 13. 'J. W.

The glue makers have an organiza tion now. We venture the assertion that they'll "stick" to it. vThe next session of the North Caro lina Methodist Episcopal Conference is to bo held in Elizabeth City. 4 It ia doubted whether Klondike means ''plenty of fish" a3 has been stated, or "plenty of fish stories." The "international agreement" farce can't last much longer. President Mc Kinley himself evidently sees this. The Democrats in this State believe irj the annexation scheme. That party ia trying to annex Capt. Buck Kitchen. AThe Methodist Conference passed a formal resolution denouncing the manufacture and eale of cigarettes. Good! An exchange wisely suggests that five cent cotton may yet prove a bless ing in disguise, by teaching farmers to raise their own supplies. The Democratic Executive Commit tee address fell so fiat that there is a growing suspicion that it was a pan cake instead of an address. "The.Baptist State Convention met Oxford last Wednesday. The meet ing was well attended and many mat ters of interest were discuc3ed. . It ia not yet too late to sow wheat. What is the price of cotton! Answer this question and no comment on the question of sowing wheat is necessary. Congress is ia session again:- This may or may not mean trouble in the future. It is a pity that bad men are generally in the majority in our na tional legislature. Kentucky preacher recently said m a sermon that there was no devil. His audience then proceeded to raise xum(thedevi) and made it much too warm for the parson. The poultry show at Asheville occurs January 4th. Charlotte is to have one Januray 12-14. Special premiums at the Asheville fair aggregate $700, and there are $1500 additional in cash premiums. $l subscriber requests us to ask our readers if it pays to subsoil clay land. If so, when is the proper time for doing it and what ia the proper depth? We hope our readers will give their expe rience on this subject. Now the Alliance shoe factory is in operation. Perhaps a good many have bought their winter shoes, but there will be a steady demand for certain grades, and we trust that the brethren will patronizo the factory in every way possible. iA good j Dke is cut at the expense of the football players. uWhat kind of animal i3 it that hag very strong limbs a fierce temper, wild bushy hair on its head and is called the king of beasts!" asked tecchor.

"Feeding Experiments.Milk Records, etc.," is the title of bulletin No. 143 re cently issued by the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station. It was prepared by Prof. Frank E E-nery Agriculturist of the Station. It con tains some valuable information and ye advise our readers to write for it. V Serif! Jenkins, of Chatham, has set tled his taxes with the State. He was really the first Sher ff in North Caro lina to eettle in full, although the Sheriff of Johnson also claims this honor. Sheriff Ellington, however, omitted one item from -his report. This puts old Chatham at the head cf the pro cession. ffhe Winston Republican says that a country Democrat asked who is General Winston who drew up those resolutions at the meeting of the Demo cratic Executive Committee. When told that he was a renegade Republican and voted for Cleveland, he sighed and said "if a radical writes the Demo, cratic platform I'll de darned if I will vote the ticket." "KIa leading English paper, the London Daily Chronicle says that President McKinlev's message, is weak and tame compared with Piesident Cieve land's, and eays McKmiey's comments on the currency question "are poaiti tively childish."

VWe regret that owing to the absence of our associate editor, who expected to compile the proceedings of the Meth ndiat Conference, which heid such a successful session here week before last, the proceedings did not appear in our last week's issue. We owe an apology to our readere, but a3 the error was not detected till too late to remedy and the news is now etale we shall have to let this matter go with promises to do better in future. iir readers patronfza our advertis ers.

Western North Carolina ia getting famous as an apple-producing section. Bro. Geo. E. Boggs is one of the most successful, enserprising and progressive of these apple growers. Apples are now being shipped from Wayneaville to New York and even to Europe. Everywhere these apples are winning the praise they so richly deserve.

CRATIC STATE EXECU TIVE COMMITTEE. "Twere better we had never met," as the goat remarked after his unsuc cessful attempt to knock a cast iron dog clean across a three acre lawn . BANKING IN TEXAS.

RECORDS TELL A STORY. A certain newspaper in Raleigh "it self an organized hypocrisy' has had much to say about the employment, by Gov. Russell, of counsel to assist the Attorney General in the important railroad litigation pending in the courts, in many respects the most important that has arisen in the State during its existence. While the statutes do not contemplate that the Attorney General of the State shall appear for the State in all matters where the State is inter ested, as no provision is made for the expense that would be necessarily in curred in so doing, and it would be im possible to do so, and also to be in at tendance upon the sitting of the Su preme court for about seven months in the year, still one would think from the wild statements made by the above referred to newspaper, that not a cent had been paid for extra legal services prior to the present administration. A cursory glance at the Auditor's reports shows that more than $46,000 were paid out for additional legal help dur ing the terms of Attorney General Kenan, Davidson and Osborne. In some instances it was probably properly expended, as when the Attorney Gen era! was not able to attend to the par ticular business by reason of pressing public duties elsewhere; in many other instances the Attorney General doubt less could and ought to have attended to the same without the employment of any other counsel. The statutes authorizing the Governor to employ coulsjI were passed with a view to giving the legal officer of the S:ate as sistance in cases of great importance, in which it become necessary to secure the ablest It gal talent to be found to meet the formidable array of lawyers against the State. But be all this as it may, the examination of the Auditor's ports disclose the facts and lays bare the contemptible and sneaking hypoc risy of certain Democratic "axe grind ers" and "organ grinders."
