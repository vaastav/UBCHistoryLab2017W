Bulamy Storer, its minister at Brussels. This was followed by the respective appoint, mOnt of consuls, thereby fully resun. ing the rolations interrupted by the war. In M'ditlon to its consular relrt sentation in the United States tlt Spanish government has appointud consuls for Cuba, who havo boon pro visionally recogized during the mill tnry administration of aafrairs of that island. Judicial Intercourse between ihl courts of Cuba and Porto ltico and of Spain has been cetablished, its provided by the treaty of peace. Th Cuhar. political prieon-jers in Spanish penao stations have been and aro boing re leased and returned to tbole homos, in accordance with Article VI of tie treaty. Negotiations are about to be had for defining thbe conventional rela tions between the two countries, which full into abeyance by reason of the war. I trust those will include a favoraba arrangement for commercial rveilpro city under ti e terms of Sections 3 and 4 o t he current tariff act. In these, as in all imatters of international concern. r o effort will be spared to respond to tho good disposition of Spain, and to cultivate in all practicame ways tht initimacy which should provail between I wo nations whose past history h~a so oft,en and in so many ways been marked by sincere friendship and by comumun ity of interests.

I leave not thought It wise to commit the entire government of the islanid to olilcers selected by the people, because I doubt whether in habits, training and expe rience they are such as to fit them to exercise at once .so large a deore of salf.-govunment,, but it, is my judg ment and expectation that tiey will soon 'attain an experience and wisdlomr and self-control that will justify con ferrincg upon themr a m'fdh larger'patr ticipation In the choice of t'he Insular officers.
