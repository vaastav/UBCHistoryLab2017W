By MAXIMILIAN HARDEN Special Dispatch to The Tribune. (Copyright. 1922, By Great Falls Tribune) Berlin. Dec. 9—At tlie grave of Lin coln, you, "Citizen" Georges Clemen ceau, made a vow to endeavor to fol low the example the great Abraham set for all future statesmen, lie who an swers you here does not belong to those who deny your honest intentions, ... believes your will determined by h ated and tiger-like destructive fury. I always have admired your hard and steel energy and interpid defiance un lured by the will o' the wisp of passing popularity, and who in his country's darkest lionr proved himself its strong est personality. Always have I ad mired the man, who in the 1871 as sembly at Bordeaux protested against Germany's annexation of Alsace-Lor raine arid as the only survivor of that gathering, brought the lost provinces back where eight years later winning the right to the inscription on stone in every community of his country: "Le Citoyen Georges Clemenceau, a bien marite de la patrie." The physician's courage of an octo genarian in crossing the Atlantic and goiug from town to town defending France also is admirable. For myself I am sure the senate's exceptions do, not, justify the German press in term ing your trip a fiasco that will re bound to Germany's advantaged Retafns Strength Because I consider you strong de spite your age I think it necessary to declare before your hearers that you are laboring under a disastrous and dangerous delusion. The smile quiv ering under your moustache indicates you would not have been surprised at] an even more rude answer coming from Germany. But aren't you reproached in your own country for great blun ders. Has it not been your fate to be judged as unfit to rise to the presi dency, because your own people con-, sider you useful only as a steel instru ment of war. The same would have been the fate of Lincoln had he lived, and after victory, continued to treat the southern states as deadly enemies, But. the patriarch you praised at Springfield, Illinois, was made of dif ferent stuff.

IS 1SÜCCESS Declares He Has Shown U. S. That France Will Stand Behind Promise. Welcomed by Cheering Throng in Philadel phia; Turns Westward * Philadelphia, Dec. 0.—(By The As sociated Press.)—Georges Clemenceau, the grizzled French war premier. Sat urday ended his formal speaking Mis sixn to America before the Philadelphia Forum in the academy of music, with the bsoad intimation that he believed he had accomplished all of the three purposes for which he forsook his cot tage by the sea in France. Of two of them, he evinced no doubt. Ile was confident he had convinced America that France was not a mili taristic nor an imperialistic nation. He was equally sure he had spread ! conviction that France intended to pay i her war debt to America—not immedi lately, perhaps, but ultimately. , He quoted again a paragraph from I {President Harding's annual message to ; congress Friday as an indication that the third point—bringing America back to the side of France and England also was being accomplished. The paragraph was the president's I comment on the four power pact which j I said to him, I believed his feeling would find its way toward us. And I has -.„ 1 d ? n t know what th» diplomats will make of it." It was j again his "peace message" that Cle i menceau delivered to the audience that But it M'as a plea for peaci j faced him I based on France's ideals, and these ! idfîils. he declared, France would de 11 '! to the last drop of her blood, even ; if she had to defend them alone, j All the five formal addresses he had made before were blended in this last i of the series. Now he was the fiery j "figer." flashing defiance against I France's enemies; now the advocate, ! carefully stating his case; now an old man, pleading for his native land, that be not misunderstood. Several times lie was interrupted by ! applause. At the end he was given k j long ovation. Clemenceau spoke after he had been over'taken through crowded downtown [streets to Independence hall—the cra die of the nation—where he saw the historic Liberty Bell, and sat in the chair that John Hancock used when he j signed the Declaration of Independence Scene of Military Pomp -, Crowds had massed about Indepen I fienc<? fiali an < 3 be was cheered as he ' pr, t p red and left the famous old struc i tu ^: "is escort was Philadelphia's proud the executive said had brought "a new confidence in the maintained peace," and which he suggested "might be a model for like assurances, wherever in the world any common interests are concerned."

Clemenceau cou tinned, "that' when he pondered on what est military body—the First city troop —attired in resplendent dress uniforms of a pattern imitating the American revolution. Ii was the troop which has had the honor of escorting every president who has visited Philadelphia since the days of George Washington.

The Tiger drove immediately to his private car, which left this afternoon for Chicago, where on Monday he will deliver a special message to* the na tion's farmers at a farmers' convention, Among M. Clemenceau's guests at luncheon on the ear was Bernard M. Baruch, who was one of President Wil son's advisers during the peace confer euce in Paris.
