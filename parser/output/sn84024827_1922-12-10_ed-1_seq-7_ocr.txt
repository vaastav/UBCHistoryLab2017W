Believes He Accomplished All Three of Purposes for Which He Crossed Sea I I PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 9. (By the f Associated lress) Georges CUmeu-j ceau, the grizzled French war pre-!, mier, today ended his "formal" speak j ing mission to America before the j Philadelphia Forum in the academy j of music with the broad intimation ! . that he believed he had accomplished I all of the three purposes for which j he forsook his cottage by the sea in Prance. Of two of the, he evinced. He was confident he had convinced America that France was not amn itaristic nor an imperialistic nation. He was equally sure he had spread conviction that France intended to pay lie debt t,o America not imme diately perhaps, but ultimately. ' He quoted again a paragraph from President Harding's annual message to. congress yesterday as an indica tion that the third point bringing America back to the side of France nuu fiiUKianu also wan twin? ar-i complished. The paragraph was the pdesident's comment on the four power pact which the executive said had brought "a new confidence in the maintained peace" and which he suggested "might be made a model for like assurances, whereevet in the worii any common interests are concerned" "Io told your chief, "Clemenceau continued "that when he pondered on what I had said to him, I be lieved his feeling would find its way toward us. And I believe it has. But I don't know what the diplimats will make of it." It ,was again his "peace message," that Clemenceau delivered to the representative audience that faces him in the gayly decked academy of music. But it was a plea for peace based on France's ideals and these ideals, ha declared, France would defend to the last drop of her blood, even if she had to defend them alone.
