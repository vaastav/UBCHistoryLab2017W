From the New Orleans Times-Democrat. With the widening of the franchise in 1833 and 1806, a fresh chapter in British politics was begun. A couple of decades elapsed before the new de mocracy was conscious of its strength. In the years from 1880 to 190G, the sweep of the change became manifest, and at the last general election was clear to the blindest eyes. We may be sure that, in the general election of 1910, the metamorphosis will be fairly complete. Socialism, though as yet numerically weak In the house of commons, even now leavens the lump of the budget and labor adopts a tone that would have startled ultra radicals a generation ago. In such circum stances the peers are bound to be polit ical ciphers for the politician with out a constituency is a shadow with out a substance. England needs a second chamber, but no sound democ racy will tolerate a second chamber of this sort. And the case would not be essentially altered, if all the - peers measured up to the standard of Rose bery and Cromer. It matters not whether Mr. Asquith, or Balfour, wins at tbe polls; the house of lords must be mended or ended. As a court of ap peal, it is well enough; as a legislative assembly, it is a galvanized corpse. Dogs of the British Upper Ten. From the New York Press. A hundred thousand dollars is . the value of some thousand dogs owned by the upper ten in Britain, and some of these dogs are worth $5,000 apiece. Pomeranians have maids somewhat after the manner of babies of wealth. These maids carry along pasteurized milk, filtered water, cologne, atomizers, meat extract for warm beef tea, breasts of chicken and choicest pieces of beef; gold, ivory and silver tooth and hair brushes, aud combs; lace handkerchiefs, gloves, shoes, alcohol stoves for warming food, jeweled feedig spoons and an assortment of ex pensive colored ribbons. These little dogs go about in automobiles, sitting or lying in silk-lined boxes upon pillows of softest down, and are covered with guilts of eiderdown. Uplifting Father. Jtoui the Atchison Globe. The. men here of late have another fight on their bands, and it is with daughter's music teacher. Men. hav ing low tastes, like ragtime music, buy a piano and hire a teacher, that daugh ter, In the evening, may make them forget the day's worries with ragtims pounded out with enthusiasm. But daughter isn't allowed to play rag time; her teacher, if she is anybody at all, would not let her touch a ragtime sheet, and father has to hear music in which there Is a whole lot of hand gymrcstics and not a Jingle. This is in accord with the plot in which all wo men are implicated to upllfe father in spite of his screams. BALLINGER AGAIN President Taft Indicates in his message that he will send another communication to Congress dealing with the Department of the Interior. It would seem to the ordinary citizen that the most effective way of deal ing with the Department of the Interior is not by that means, but by re questing Mr. R. Achilles Ballinger to resign from the secretaryship. 1

If the shadows and the dust Collier's Weekly this week, adduces till further proof of the friendli ness of the Secretary of the Interior for the coal-grabbers. The question which Collier's asked: "Do the Guggenheims control the Department of tha Interior?" is answered by the second installment of proof if there had been any before. Mr. Taft, in the letter which Mr. Ballinger prepared for his own white washing, was imposed on. Hence, the letter which should have exonerat ed him, is Just so much waste paper. For that letter stated that Ballinger did only a mere trifle for one claimant. Collier's shows that Ballinger had a monopoly of the coal land business for the spoilers. His nephew now represents these interests. Does more need to be said? In other word3. Ballinger was placed in power at the behest of these in terests the same Interests which have stolen the gold the same interests which are now seeking the coal and the copper. The 6poil and loot wai accomplished by the bribery of legislators and government officials in the gold land case. "Senatorial courtesy" removed the exposure from the congressional record. Then the Alaska Gold Mining Company was expos ed in the Senate. And these are the same men. And now, with their own attorney their hireling of a few months ago. at the head of the Interior department the grabbing of the coal and copper lands of Alaska which belong to the whole people of the United States is contemplated if not accomplished. And Ballinger was worth the hiring. Did he not try to make good the theft of the lands by having the Cunningham claims subject to special law? Collier's has proved that he was the attorney for the whole outfit of land grabbers, which are opeerating in Alaska. "When Ballinger represented Cunningham, he represented all the Cunningham claims. Not only this, but the record is quick with the evidence of his employment by other Alaska coal claim ants at different times. Under date of December ::. 1ftOS, a little over two months before he took office as Secretary of the Interior. Ballinger wrote to the Register and Receiver of the United States Land Office at Juneau, Alaska, saying that he represented W. G. Whorf, whose entry was known as Coal Survey No. 315. On Janu ary 7, 1900, less than sixty days before Ballinger became Secre tary of the Interior, M. A. Green, who represents another Alaska coal syndicate, wrote to John W.Dudley, Register of the Juneau Alaska, Land Office: "I submitted this scrip to Judge Ballinger as my lawyer, and he has approved the same, saying it was regular in every way, so I bought it and paid for it and am sending it forward to you at this time." Do you want more? Again, in this same letter. Green wrote: "I am expecting to go to Chicago the latter part of this month to meet Mr. McKenzie' the same McKenzie who supported Ballinger's argument before the Committee on Public Lands in favor of the Cale bill "and others interested in the Doughten ground, and shall expect to take up the work of perfecting their surveys and title as soon as possible." John Ballinger, a nephew of Achilles, now represents these inter ests. Under date of April 19, 1909 six weeks after Ballinger took the oath of office as Secretary of the Interior Walter M. French of the law firm of Allen & French of Seattle, wrote John W. Dudley, Register of the Juneau Land Office: "Mr. Harriman. whom I rep resent, has on several occasions taken the matter of sale up with Judge Ballinger, whose firm represented the purchasers, and with Mr. Hartline, and the parties have at all times seemed to be in per fect accord." If a city puts Into the city attorneyship an attorney who is still retained by the public utilities corporations you have a parallel case. If he ope ates in their favor it is graft. Ballinger ! GIVE MUCHBOUBLE Little Tots Who Appropriate Goods a Bother to the Merchants. TEMPTATION TOO GREAT In the busy rush of the holiday sea son the kid kleptomaniac is giving the Main street merchants considerable trouble. The kid kleptomaniac isn't a criminal. "He" is generally about two years old and is a chubby well dressed little boy or girl. It is in the toy shoes where the tiny kleptoman iacs do their work. Finding themselveo surrounded with a glittering array of drums, trumpets, building blocks. Jack-in-the-boxes, French harps and a hundred other wonderful things, the temptation proves too strong. Mamma is at an other counter pricing something. "Johnny" picks up a beautiful golden trumpet, tests it. decides that it is all to the good and calmly walks off with the coveted article. But a vigilant clerk, ever watchful during the holiday season, has seen "Johnny." Mother is notified. A severe lecture, a few tears 'which finally winds up by the purchase of the trumpet and "Johnny" is happy again. There are dozens of such cases during the glad Christmas holidays. The children mean no harm. It is simply their childish desire for things beautiful and they do not real ize that such articles cost money. It keeps the clerks constantly busy tak ing playthings away from the children, but there is no remedy for it as the matter is beyond the Jurisdiction of the police. RED SKINS BREAK OUT AGAIN A Longing for Warmer Clothing and Wholesome Food Said to Be the Cause New War Paint. The recent cold snap and the ne cessity for heavier clothing and blood making food is the occasion for anoth er breaking out of the red skins, which promises to be the most serious in years, although destined to be short lived. Instead of the old style war paint, a harmless, non-greasy, flesh colored product called poslam is used which makes short work of every form of breaking out, particularly eczema, stopping the terrible itching with first application and curing chronic cases in two weeks. So with hives, tetter, rash, acne, psoriasis, piles, red noses, pimples and every form of itch ing skin disease, including barber's itch. No one is asked to take our word, as the sample package which the Emer gency laboratories. No. West Twenty-fifth Street. New York, is sending out by mail free of charge to every one who writes for it tells the whole story and is sufficient to clear the complexion over-night or to rid the face of pimples in 24 hours. W. H. Sudhoff makes a specialty of pos lam and always keeps on sale both the 50-cent and $2 sizes. The unspeakable torture of Rheumatism ran be promptly relieved and eventually itoppmi by tbe vse of Crocker's Rheumatic Cure. Even in the most advanced and obstinate rases this wonderful remedy rarely fails, because it supplies the blood with the power to eradicate the cause of the disease. Why suffer, when prompt relief can be bad from Crocker's Rheumatic Cure. FHLUJPS DRUG CtX. WAJtKEM. PA. Far aale at 50c a battla by j Clem Tklstletbwalte Wllllasa O.

' Collier's answers: "On June 26, 1900, Donald R. McKenzie, Ballinger's intimate associate and client, told Special Agents Jones and Glavis in Seat tle that Secretary Garfield's attitude toward the Alaska coal claims in which he and his friends were Interested, was such "that they brought pressure to bear on Senators and Representatives to pre vent his remaining in the Cabinet under President Taft." Conservation means the protecting of the people's land and interests from falling into the hands of a few. Ballinger has already helped in a private and public capacity to despoil the country. And the country will not bs content with a mere whitewash, nor will a congressional investiga tion by a picked committee from the friendly interests do. The people owe a debt of gratitude to Collier's for the publication of the facts in this matter. It is still the crisis in the administration of President Taft. By his handling of the Ballinger case the whole may be known. He is on one side or the other. Vanquish, let me keep my trust. Childlike as upon a day When I knelt and learned to pray. Baltimore Sun.

BEAUTIFUL WOMEN Bad Stomach Causes Unsightly Com plexions. L. H. Fine Has a Remedy. Bad stomachs mean bad blood; bad blood means sallow, unattractive skin. Why? The stomach is a healthy condition separates tbe nutritious mat ter from the blood and gives it to the blood to supply the entire body with nourishment. If the stomach is not in a healthy condition it does not separate from the blood the nutritious matter and it passes off with the waste. Thus the blood is impoverished and has not sufficient nourishment to sup ply the muscles, skin and bodv gener ally. If you have belching of gas, distress after eating, nausea, biliousness, ner vousness or foul breath, then your stomach is wrong and you want the best prescription for stomach troubles the world has ever known.
