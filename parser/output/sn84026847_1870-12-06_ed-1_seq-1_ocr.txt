VOL. 8. WHEELING, W. VA., TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, 1870. NO. 287. President's Message. (ientlemen oj the Senate and /fouxe of Representatives : A vear of peace and general prosper iiv tu this nation haa passed since the ' last assembling of Congress. We have through a kind Providence l>een blesned with abundant crop and have been spared from complications and war with foreign nations. In our midst comparative harmony has been restored. It is to be regretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective franchise has by violence and intimidation been denied to citizens in exceptional ca-ee. in the several States lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people lias thereby been reversed. The Slates of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas hare hem restored to representation in our national councils. Oeorsria. the only i State without representation, may con fidently be expected to take her place j there also at the beginning of the new \ear. and then, let us hope, will be com- ; pieted the work of reconstruction WitUan acquiescence on the part of the ! fieople in the national obligation to pay lie public debt created a- the price of i>nr I nion, the | tensions to our disabled -ol lit-rs and sailors and their widows I and orphans, and in the changes to the constitution which have ! |.et*n made necessary by a great rebellion, there is no reason why we I should not advance in material pros- ; per;tv and happiness as no other nation j lid after ?? protract ed and devastating a war ; THE Et'Rol'EAN W \ll. Soon after the existing war broke I out in Kurope, the protection of the I'm ted .States Minister in Paris was in voked in lavor ot the North Germans | domiciled in French territory. Instruc tions were issued to urant the protec tion this lms been followed by an ex tension ot American protection to the citizens of Saxonv, Hesse and Sax Co ining, (iotha. Columbia, Portugal, Uru guay, the Dominican Republic I Kcuador, Chili, Paraguay and Venezu- 1 e'a In Paris the charge was an oner- j ivi? one, rerjuiring constant and severe! labor as well as the exercise of patience prudence and good judgment It has! Ii en performed to the entire satisfaction o this Government, and as 1 am official ly informed, equally so to the satis'ac-i tion of the Government of Xorth Ger many. UKl X.MU >N OK

IIAN AKK.UUs It is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba '?as materially changed since the close ? last session ot t'ongrcss. In an early stage of the Contest the authori ' e? of Spain inaugurated a system of ??iriiitrnry arre-ts, of close confinement, ?" military trial and execution of persons "-jH-cted ot complicity with the insur gents and of the summary embargo of 'tieir property and requisitions of their revenues by the executive warrant. Such I 'Oeeedii;gs as far as they h:ive ail'ect td the persons or property of citizens o1 'he 1 nited States were in vio'ation of 'he provisions of the treaty of 1T95, '?"tueen the United States and Spain. '?eprese,.tationsof injuries resulting to several persons claiming to f>e citizens "! ',"e. United States, by reason of such vi'"a'ions, were made" to the S|?nish government, from April, IStiy, to ? 'ine last. The Spanish Minister ?t Washington had been clothed j a limited power to aid in ^dressing such wrongs. That power was found to be withdrawn in view, as " was said, of the favorable situation in 'i< 1 the Island of Cuba then was, , however, did not lead to a revo "ftion or the suspension of the extraor ry nfid arbitrary functions exer cised by the executive power in Cuba and we were obliged to make our com plaint at Madrid. In the negotiation thug opened and still pending there, the United States only claimed that, for the i future, the right* secured to their citi zens by the treaty should be respected in Cuba, and that, as to the pant, a joint tribunal should be established ; in the United States with full jurisdic- ; tion over all such claims before such an impartial tribunal: and each claim- , iant would be required to prove hi* case, j On the other hand Spain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact ; and thus complete equality would be done, a rase which at one time threat ened seriously to effect the nations. Between the United States and# Spain it has already been disposed Of in this way. ARBITRATION OF CLAWS. The claim of the "Colonel Lloyd As pinwall" for the illegal seizure'and de , tention of that vessel, wan referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and has j resulted in an award to the United States for the owners, of the sum ol ; $19,702.50 in fold. Another and 1 long pending claim ot a like nature, that of the whale ship Canada, has been disposed of bjr friendly arbitration. During the 1 presentyear it was referred by the joint consent of Brazil and the Ui.ited States to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Washington, who kindly undertook tho laborious task of examining the ! voluminous mass ot correspondence and testimony submitted by the two governments, and awarded to the United States the sum of one hundred thousand seven hundred and forty dol lars and nine cents in gold which has since been paid by the Imperial Gov- 1 emment. These recent examples show that the mode which the United States have proposed to Spain tor adjusting the (tending claims is just and feasible and that it may be } agreed to by either nation without \ dishonor. It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be aceeded to by ! Spain without further delay. Should the pending negotiations unfortunately j and unexpectedly be without result, it ; will then become my duty to communi- j eate that fact to Congress and invite its 1 action on the subject. SOUTH AMERICAN PKAC'K COS! KKKXCK. The long deferred peace conference : between Spain and the allied South American Republics has been inaugu rated in Washington under the auspices of the United States. Fursuant|to the i recommendations contained in the reso- 1 lutinn of the House of Representatives | ot the seventeenth of December. I 1S66, the Executive Department of J the Government offered its friend- 1 ly offices for the promotion of I peace and harmony between Spain and ( the allied republics. Hesitations and I obstacles occurred to the acceptance of J the offer. Ultimately, however, a con fereuce was arranged and was opened ; in this city on the 2Vth ol October. : last, at which I authorized the Secretary of State to preside. It was attended by the Ministers of Spain, Peru, Chili and Ecuador. In consequence of the ab seuce of a representative from Bolivia, j the conference was adjourned until the : attendance of a plenipotentiary from j that republic could be secured, or other measures could be adop ted towards compassing its ob ject The allies and the republics of Spanish reign on this continent may see in this fact a new proof of our sin cere interest in their welfare, our desire ! to see them blessed with good govern ment capable of maintaining order and ; preserving their respective territorial in tegrity, and of our sincere wish to extend our owp commercial and social relations with them. The time is not probahjy far distant when in the natural course of events the European political connection with this continent will cease. Our policy should be shaped in view of this probability so a* to ally the commercial inter ests of the Spanish American States more closely to our own and thus give the United States all the pre eminence, and all the advantage which Mr. Monn*, Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay contemplated when they pro posed to join the Congress of Pana ma. THK SAN 

DOMINGO BUMINKM. During the last session of Con- j gress, a treaty (or the annexation of the Republic of San Domingo to the United States, failed to receive the re- ! quieite two-thirds vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced that the best interests of the country ' commercially and materially demanded its ratification. Time has only con firmed me in this view. I firmly believe that the moment it is known that the United State* have entirely abandoned the project of accepting as a Kirt of its territory the Island of San omingo, a free port will be negotiated for by European nations. In the Bay of Samana a lar>;e com mercial city will spring up to which we will be tributary without receiving cor responding benefits. BBAITIKS or THK SITUATION. The Government of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this a nnexation. It is a weak power.numbering probably less than one hundred and twenty thousand souls, and yet, possessing one of the richest localities under the sun, capable of supporting a, population of ten millions of people in luxury. The people of San Domingo ar> not capable of maintaining themsflves in their present condition and must look for outside support. They yearn for the protection of our free" institutions and 1 laws, our progress and civilisation. Shall we retu-e them? The acqu si tion of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographical position. It commands the entrance to the Carribean sea and the isthmus ; transit of commerce. It possesses the i richest soil, best and most capacious harbors, mo*t >a1ubrious climate, and the most valuable products of the forest, j mine and soil of any of the West India islands. 

WONDERFUL RKSl'I.TS TO FOLLOW. Its possessiop by the Untied i States will, in a few years, build up a coastwise commerce of immense magni 1 tude, which will go far towards restor : ing to the United States our merchant marine. It will give to us those arti clea which we consume greatly and do not produce, thug equalizing our exports ! and imports. In case of a foreign war it will give us command of all the islands referred to, and thus Erevent an enemy from again possessing iinself of a rendezvous upon our coast. At present our coast trade be tween the States bordering on the ; Atlantic and those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, is by tbe Baha- j mas and the Angles. Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign coun tries to get from C'e ?rgia to the east coast of Florida. San Domingo, with a stable government under which her immense resources can be developed, will give remunera- ( tive wages to ten thousand laborers not now upon the Island. This laltor j will take advantage of every available means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek the blessings of freedom and its sequence, each in- j habitant receiving the rewards of his j own labor. 

MILLENIUM TO COMB, AND NATION VI. DEBT WIPED OPT. Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery, as a measure of self preservation to retain their laborers. San Domingo will become a lartre con sumer of the products of northern farms and manufactories, the cheapest rate at which the citizens can be fur nished food, to the Island. Machinery will make it necessary that that contiguous Islands should have the same advantages, in order to com pete with the production ot sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, A'c. This will open to the United States a wider market for our products. The production of our own supply of the>e articles will cut off more than $1<H), 000,000 of our annual imports, besides increasing our exports, With such a picture it is ea?y to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to be extin guished. With a balance oftrade against us, including interest of bonds held by foreigners and money shipments to our citizens traveling in foreign lands, which are equal to the yield of precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this result is to be other wise accomplished. The acquisition of San Domingo is an adhesion to the Monroe doctrince. It is a measure of national protection. It is asserting our just claims to a controlling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from East to Webt by way of the Isthmus of Darien ; it is to build our merchant marine. It is to ftjrnish new markets for the products of our farms, shops and manufactures; it is to make slavery unsupportable in Cuba and Porto Kico at once, and ulti mately so in Brazil; it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba, and end an exterminating conflict; it is to provide honest means of paying our honest debts without overtaxing the people; it is to furnish our citizens with the J necessaries of everv-day life at cheaper rates than ever before, and it is a rapid stride towards that greatness which the intelligence, industry and enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle this conn try to assume among nations now TO DO IT. In view of tlie importance of this question, I earnestly urge upon Con gress early action expressive of its views as to the best means of acquiring San Domingo. My sugges tion is that by a joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a Commis sioner to negotiate for a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo !or llie acquisition of that island; that an appro priation be made to defray the expenses of such commission. The question may be then determined by the action of the two houses of Congress upon a resolu tion of annexation, as in the case of the acquisition of Texas. So convinced am I ! of all the advantages to flow from ! the acquisition of San Domingo j and of the great disadvantages, I mL'ht almost say calamities to flow from non acquisition, that I believe -the subject has onlv to be investigated to be approv ed. THK MEXICAN QtBSTlON. It is to be regretted that our representations in regard to the injuries effected especially upon the revenues of the United States, by the policy of the Mexican government in exempt ing from import duties a large tract of its territory oh our bor ders have not only been fruit less, but that it is even proposed in that country to extend the limits within which the privilege adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed. The expediency of taking into your serious considera tion proper means for countervailing the policy referred to will, it is pre sumed, engage your earnest attention. It is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provide against injury to those who may have commit- 1 ted high crimes within their borders and who may have sought refuge abroad, i For this purpose extradition treaties i have been concluded with several of; the Central American Republics nn<i j others are in progress. THE VENSZrKI.A CLAIMS. The sense of Congress is desired as early as may be convenient upon^the proceedings of the commission on the claims against Venezuela, which are : communicated in the messages of March 4, 1 *>69, March 1, 1870 and March 31, ? 1870. It has not been deemed advis able to distribute any of the money which has been received from that gov ! ernment, until Congress shall haveacted upon the subject THE CHINESE MASSACKE. The massacres of French and Russian . residents at Tein Tsin under circum stances of great barbarity were suppos ed by some to have been premeditated and to indicaie a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese Empire. The evidence fails to establish such a supposition but shows a complicity by the local authorities with the mob. The Govern ment at Pekin, however, seems to have been disposed to fulfil its treaty 1 obligations so far as it was able to do so. i Unfortunately the news of the war be tween the German States and France reached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that the popular mind became possessed wi?h the idea that 1 thi? contebt e.xtanding to the Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian influence and power and that the time was coming when the superstitious mass might expel all foreigners and re store the Mandarin influence. Antici pating trouble from this cause, I invited France and North Germany to make an authorized suspension of hostilities in the East, where they were temporarily suspended by act of the commanders; to act together for the future protection in China of the lives and property of Americans and Europeans. THE 

SLAVE TRADE. Since the adjournment of Congress, ; the ratification of the treaty with Great Britain for abolishing the mixed courts j for the suppression of the slave trade 1 has been exchanged. It is believed that the slave trade is now confined to the eastern coast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken to the Arabian mar kets. The ratification of the Naturalization Convention between Great Britain and the United States, has also been ex changed during the recess, and thus a long standing dispute between the two governments has been settled in accord ance with the principles always con tended for by the United States. 01" K NORTHWESTERS BOUNDARY. In April last, while engaged in locat* 1 ing a military reservation near Pem bina, a corps of engineers discovered that the commonly received boundary ; line between the United States and the | British possessions, at that place, iei about OTUO feet south of the true posi tion of the zenith parallel, and that the | line when run on what is now supposed j to be the true position of that par allel, would leave part of the Hud son Bay Company at Pembina with in the territory of the United States. This imformation being communicated to the British Government, 1 was re : quested to consent, and I did consent ! that the British occupation on the part i of the Hudson Bay Company, should i continue for the present. I deem ! it important, however, that this j part t>f the boundary line should be definitely fixed by ja joint commission of the- govern ; rnents, and submit herewith the esti | mates of the expense of such a commis I sion on the part of the United States, ; and recommend that an appropriation ! lie made for that purpose. The land | boundary is already fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky moun tains to the Georgian bay. Should it not be in like manner marked from the 1 Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky mountains THE ALABAMA CLAIMS. I regret to say that no conclusion.has been reached tor the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by that Gov ernment during the rebellion. The Cabinet of London, so far as its viewc, have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that Her Majesty's Government was guilty of negligence, or did or permitted any act during the war by which the United States has just cause of complaint. My firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse, and I therefore recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a commissioner to take the proof, and the amounts, and the ownership of these claims, on notice to the representative of Her Majesty at Washington, and that authority he given for the set tlement of these claims by the United States, so that the Government shall have the ownership of the private claims as well as the responsible con trol of all the demands against Great Britain. It can't be necessary to add that whenever Her Majesty's Govern ment shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these i claims, the United States will j enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. THE FISHERIES. Tiie course pursued by the Cana dian authorities toward the fisher men of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By the first ar ticle of the convention of 1818, between 'Great Britain and the United States, it was agreed that the inhabitants of the United should have forever, in common t with the British subjects the right of I taking fish in certain waters therein de- | fined in the water not include! in these limits named in the convention of three miles of the ports of the British coast. It has been the custom lor many years to give to the intruding fishermen of the United States a reas onable warning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain. 1 The Imperial Government is under- \ stood to have delegated the whole, or a share of itsjurisdiction and control of the sea shore fishing grounds to the j Colonial authority, known as the Do- 1 minion of Canada, and this semi-inde- 1 | pendent but irresponsible agent ' has exercised its delegated pow- j er in an unfriendly way. Vessels ; have been seized without notice or j warning, in violation of the custom pre- j viously prevalent, and have been taken i into the colonial ports, their voyages | broken up, and their vessels condemnefl. j THE WAIL OK TUB FISHERMEN. There is reason to believe that this un- ! friendly and vexatious treatment j was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the I'nited States, with a view to' political eliect upon this Government. The statutes of the Dominion of Cana da assume a still broader and more un tenable jurisdiction over the vessel of : the United States. They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within three marine miles of any of tne coasts, bays, creeks or har j bors of Canada iuto port, to search the ! cargo and examine the master on I : oath touching the cargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecu niary penalty if a true answer be I not given, and if such a vessel is found preparing to fish within three marine miles of any such coasts, bays, creeks or j harbors without a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, this Dro vides that the vessel, with her tackle, Ac., &c , shall be forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations have been made under this statute. Should : the authorities of Canada attempt to i enforce it, it will be ray duty to take such steps aB may be necessary to protect i the right* of the citizens of the United States. It has been claimed by her ; Majesty's officers that the fishing vea ' eels of the United States have no right ' to enter the open p)rta of the British ; possessions in North America, except for the purpose of shelter and repairing damages, of purchasing wood and ob taining water; that they have no right to enter at the British custom | houses, or to trade, except for the purchase of wood and water; and that they must depart within twenty-four hours after notice to leave. It is not known that any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United States has been made under this claim. So far as the claim is found ed on any alleged construction of the Convention of I?13 it cannot be acquiesc ed in by the United States. It is hoped that it will not be insisted on by ller Majesty's government. During the conference which preceeded the negotia-" tion of the Convention of 1 Ml S, the British Commission proposed to expressly exclude the fisher men of the United States from the privilege of carrying on trade with any of Her British Majesty's subjects resid ing within the limits assigned for their use, and also that it should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States engaged in such fishing to have on board any goods, wares or merchan dize whatever except such as may be I necessary for the prosecution of their voyage to and from t-aid fisning grounds, and any vessel which shall contravene this regulation, may be seized, con demned, and confiscated with their car goes. This proposition, which is iden tical with tiie construction now put upon the language of the Convention, was emphatically regretted by the Commissioners, and thereupon was abandoned by the British plenipoten tiaries, and Article 1, as it stauds in the Convention, was substituted. If, i however, it is said that this claim is founded on provincial or colonial stat utes, and not upon the Convention, , this Government cannot but regard J them as unfriendly and in contraven tion of the faithful execution of which j the Imperial Government is alone re- j ponsible. I anticipate that an attempt j may possibly be made bv the Canadian authorities in the coming season to re-j peat these un neighborly acts towards our fishermen. BCTLER S SON? I.NTEUCOl'KSK 1'J.AN'. I recommend you to confer up- j on the power to suspend by procla mation the operation of t lie laws : authorizing the transit of goods, wares ajid merchandise in bond .across to the territory of the United States and Can ada, and further, should such an ex treme measure become necessary, to gujpend the operations of any of the laws whereby, the vessels of the Domin ion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States. Alike un friendly disposition has been manifested on the part of Canada with the main tainanceofa claim of the right to exclude the citizens of the United States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. SATURATION OK THE ST. I.AWRKNVK. The river constitutes a natural outlet I to the ocean, with an aggregate popula tion of about 17,600.1)00 inhabitants, and with an aggregate tonnage of 601, 367 tons upon the waters which dis charge into it. The foreign commerce of our ports in these waters is open to British competition, and the major part of it is done in British bottoms. If the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to theoce.tn, the mono|> oly of the direct commerce of the lake port* of the Atlantic would be in for eign hands, their vessels on trans Atlantic voyages, having an access to our lake ports, which would he denied to American vessels on similar voyages. To state such a proportion is to refute its justice. During the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay unquestionably demonstrates the nation al right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the Congress of Vienna in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations showed thejudg-j ment of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of -a country | through which a navigable river passes have a national right to enjoy the nav- 1 igation of that river to and into the sea , even though passing through the terri- j torv of another power. This right does not exclude the coequal right of the sovereign possessing the ter ritory through which the river debouches into the sea, to make such \ regulations relative to the policy of the navigation as may be reasonably neces- 1 sary, but those regulations should be j framed in a liberal spirit of comity and should not impose needles* burdens I upon the commerce which has the right of transit. It has been found in practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mu-i tual agreement. The L'nited States ! are ready to make any reasonable ar rangement as to the police of the St. Lawrence which may be suggested by Great Britain. It" the claim by Mr. Clay was just when the population of the States bordering on the shores of the lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derives greater force and equity from the in creased population, wealth, production and tonnage of the States on the Cana- j dian frontier line. Mr. Clay advances his arguments in behalf of our rights. PECKDEXTS. The principles for which he contended has been frequently and bv various na tions recognized by law or by treaty and has been extended to several other preat rivers. Bv the treaty concluded at May ence in 1831 the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first naviga ble pnto the sea by the convention. Between Spain and Portugal it was concluded in 1835 that the navigation of the Douro throughout its whole ex- ' tent was made free for the subjects ol both the crowns. In 1853 the Argen tine Republic, bv treaty, threw open the free navigation of the Parana and ? Uruguay to the merchant veseelsof all nations. In 1856 the Crimean war was closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigation of the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia, by a treaty, declared that it re ; garded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, 1 in accordance with the fixed principles of national law, a a highways or chan ! nela opened bv nature for the commerce of all nations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December, 1866, the Emperor of | Brazil, by Imperial decree, declared the Amazon to be open to all the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The greatest living British authority on the subject, while asserting the abstract right of the Brit ish claims, says: It seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her ! refusal upon strict law, but it i? equally I difficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law. Secondly, that her con duct with respect to the naviga | tion of the St. Lawrence is ' glaring and discreditably inconsistent with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi. On the . ground that she possessed a small do main in which the Mississippi took its ; rise, she insisted on this right to navi gate the entire volume of its waters. On ' the ground that she possesses both I banks of the St. Lawrence where itdia I einhoeues into the sea, she denies to , the United States the right of naviga | tion, though about one-half of the waters of lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan through which the river flows, are the property of the United States. The whole nation is intere?ted in securing cheap transporta tion from the agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic seaboard; to the I citizens of those States it secures a ' greater return for their labor; to the in habitants of the seaboard it offers cheaper food; to the nation an increase | in the annual surplus of wealth. It is hoped that the government of Great i Britain will see the justice of aban ! doning the narrow and inconsistent claims to which her Canadian provinces ; have urged her adherence. DECLINE OF COMMERCE. i Our depressed commerce is a subject to which 1 called your special attention at the last session and suggested that we will in the future have to look more to the countries south of us and to China and Japan for ita revival. Our representatives to all these governments have exerted their in fluence to encourage trade between the United States and the countries to which they were accredited. But the fact exists that the carrying is d*ne almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and while this state of affairs exists, we can not control our due share of the com merce of the world; that I believe the Pacific States and China and Japan is about all the carrying trade now conducted in American vessels I would recommend a liberal policy to ward* that line of American steamers, one that will insure its success and even increase its usefulness. The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that compete with foreign ships in the carry ing trade, is so much greater in the United States than in foreign coun tries that, without some assistance from the * Government they cannot successfully built here. There will be several propositions laid before Congress in the course of the present session, looking to a remedy for this evil even if it should be at some cost to the Na tional treasury. I hope such encourage ment will be given, as will secure Amer ican shipping on the high seas and American shipbuilding at home. 

BUILDING FOR STATG DEPARTMENT. The condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for the early action of Congress. The building now rented by that Department is a frail structure at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion and from the other departments. It is ill adapt ed to the purpose for which it is used, and hae not the capacity to accommo date the archives, and is not fire proof. Its remote situation, its slender con struction, and the absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood leaves but little hopt of safety for either the building or its contents in case of the accident of a fire. Its destruction would involve the lo^s of the rolls con taining the original acts and resolutions of </ongresQ of the history and records of the revolution, of -the confederation, of the whole series of diplomatic and consular archives since the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many valu able records and papers loft with that department when it was the principal depository 01 the great archives. I re commend an appropriation lor the con struction ol a building for the depart ment of State I recommend to your reconsideration tlie propriety of trans 'erring to the Department of tlie Interior, 10 which they seem more appropriately to belong, all powers and other duties in relation to the territories with wijich the De partment of State is now charged by law or linage, and from the Interior Depart ment to theWar Department the Pension Bureau so far as it regnlates the payment of soldiers pensions. I would further recommend t hat the payment of naval pennon9 be transferred to one of the bureaus of the Navy Department. ESTIMATED EXPENSES. The estimates for the expenses pf the government for the fis cal year are $18,244.346.0 1 less than for the current one, but exceed the appropriation for the present year, for the same items, 18,972.127.56. In this estimate, however, is included $22,338,278.37 for public works hereto fore begun unde r Congressional provi sion, and of which only so much ie asked as Congress may choose to give. The appropriation for the same work9 fur the present fiscal vear was $11,984, 518.08. 

SPECIE PAYMENT* The average value of gold, as com pared with the national currency for , the whole of the} ear 1869Jws?about 134, and for eleven months of 1870 the same relative value has been about 1 15. The approach to a specie basis is very grat ifying, but the tact cannot be denied that the instability of the value of our currency is prejudicial to our prosperi ty. and tends to keep up prices to the detriment of trade. The evils of a depreciated and fluctuating currency are bo great that now when the premium on gold ha* fallen so much, it would seem that the time has arrived, when : by wise and prudent legislation Con gress should look to a policy which would- place our currency &t par with ( gold at no distant day. TAXES ANT RBVBNl'E REFORM. The taxes collected hare been reduced more than eighty million dollars per annum, By steadiness in our present course there is no reason why, in a few short years, the national tax gatherer may not disappear from the door of the citizen almost entirely. With the revenue stamps dispensed by the postmasters in every community ; a tax upon liquors : of ail sorts and tobacco in all itsfofm?, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a duty onlv upon those articles which one could disj>ense with, known as luxuries, and those which we use more of than we produce, revenue enough may be raised after a few years of peace and coneeouent reduction of indebtedness to fulfil all our obliga ! lions. A further reduction of the ex- j pense in addition to a reduction of the in- ' interest account may be relied to make this practicable. Revenue reform, if it 1 means this, it has my hearty support; if ! it implies a collection of all the revenue 1 for the support of the government, on j the payment of the principal aud inter- 1 est of the public debt, pensions, Jcc., by ; directly taxing the people, then I am ? against revenue reform and I confi- | dently believe the people are with me. j If it means a failure to provide the necesaary means to defray all the ex penses of the Government, and thereby i the repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then 1 am still more opposed ? to such kind of revenue reform. Rev- . enue reform has not been defined by ! any of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems to be accepted as something which is to supply every man's wants without any cost or effort on his part A true revenue reform cannot be made j in a day, but must be the work of na tional legislation and of time. As soon the revenue can be dis pensed with, all duty should be re moved from coffee, tea and other arti cles of universal use not produced bv ourselves. The necessities of the coun try compel us to collect revenue from our imports. An army of assessors and collectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizen, but that or a tariff for revenue is neces sary. Such a tariff, so far an it acts in encouragement to home products, affords employment to labor at living wages, in contrast to the pauper labor of the old world, and also in the development of home resources under the act of Congress of the 15th day of July, 1870. THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The army has gradually been re duced so tliat on the 1st of January, 1871, the number of commi.?sioned officers and men will not exceed the number contemplated by law. The war department building iaan old struc ture, not tire-proof and entirely inade quate in dimensions to our present wants. Many thousands of dol lars are now |>aid annually for the rent of private buildings to accommodate the various bureaus of the Detriment. I recommend an ap propriation for a new War Dejtartment building suited to the present arid grow ing wanuj of the nation. The re[x>rt of the Secretary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction in the ex|K?nses of the army for the last liscal year. For the details you are referred to his accompanying report. The expen ses of the navy for the whole of the last year, that is from December, 1K<>9( the date of the last rej?rf, are less than ??J'.t.tMH), <XX), or about $1,000,000 less than they were the previous year. THK 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. The expenses of the Navy Department in this fiscal year since .July 1st, show for the five months a decrease of over $2,400,000 from those of the cor resjionding months of last year. The estimates for the current year were $2,820,507.83; those for next year aie 120,683,317, with $'J75,000 ? addi tional for temporary and permanent im provements. These estimates are made closely for the maintenance of the naval establishment, as it now is without much in the nature of permanent im provement. The appropriations were i made for the last and current years and were evidently intended by Congress, and are sufficient only to keep the navy on its present footing, and the repairing and refitting of our old ships. This policy must of course gradually, but sure ly destroy the navy, and it is in itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued the ne cessity for more repairs in ships and navy yards, <Scc., become more im perative and more costly, and our cur rent expenses are actually increased for the mere repair of ships, many of which must soon be unscaworthy and useless. I hope during the present session of Congre.-w to be able to submit to it a plan by which naval vessels can be built and re paired, made with great saving upon the present cost. It can hardly lie wise statesmanship in a government which represents a country with over four thousand miles of coast line on both oceans, exclusive of Alaska, and containing forty millions of progressive people with relations of every nature with almost every foreign country ; to rest with such inadequate means of en forcing any foreign policy of protection or redress. Separated by the ocean from the nations of the British continent, our navy is our only means of direct protec tion to our citizens abroad, or for the enforcement of any foreign policy. 

POSTAL MATTERS. The accompanying report of the Post master General shows a most satisfac tory working oi that department. With the adoption of the recommendations contained therein, particularly those re lating to a reform in the franking priv ilege and the adoption of correspondence cards, a self-sustaining postal system may apeedily be looked for, and at no distant day a further reduction of the rate of postage will be attained. I re commend the authorization by Congrea* to the Postmaster General and Attorney General to issue all commissions to officers appointed through their respec tive Departments. At present, these commissions, where appointments are made, are issued by the State Depart ment The law in all the departments of the Government, except those of the Post Office and Justice authorizes, ' each to issue its own commission CI TIL SKRVICH REFORM. ' Favoring practical reforms, I * respecfully call your attention to one abuse of long standing, which I would like to see remedied by this Con gress, it is a reform in the civil ser vice of the country and I would have it go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office, of clerks and emploves who do not require the advice and consent of the Senate to make their ap { pointments complete. I would have it govern not the tenure but the manner of making all appointments There is no duty which so much embarrasses j the Executive and the heads of the De partments as that of appointment, nor is there any such anierous and j thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives, as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men and often not even fit men for a public place. The elevation aud purification of the civil service of the Government will be hail with approval by the whole people of the United States. 

INDIAN AGENCIES. Reform in the management of Indian affairs ha* received special attention ol the Administration, trom its inaugura tion to the present day. The experi ment of making it a missionary work was tried with a few agencies, given to the denominations of Iriends and has been found to work most advantageous ly. All agencieb and superintendences not so disposed of were given to officers of the army. The act of Congress, reducing the army, renders army officers ineligible for civil positions. Indian agencies be ing civil officers, I have determined to give all the agencies to such religious denominations as had heretofore estab lished missions among the Indians and perhaps to some other denominations who would undertake the same terms, t. t. as a missionary work The societies are allowed to name their own agents, subject to the approv al of the Executive, and are expected to watch over them, and aid them as missionaricrand christians, and civiliie the Indian, and instruct him in the arts of peace The Government watches over the official acts of these agents, and requires as strict an account ability as it they were appointed in any other manner. 1 entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will, in a few years, bring all Indians upon reservations where they will live in houses, have school houses and churches, will In* pursuing peaceful and self-sustaining a vocations and where they may be visited by the law abiding white-men with the satut impunity that he now visits tin. civilized white settlements I call your special attention to the report of the Commis sioner of Indian Affairs for full informa tion 011 this subject.

PUBLIC LANDS During the last fiscal year 809,541 ,300 acres of public land were disposed of. Of this quantity 389,891,006 acres were taken under the homestead law and 215,859,581 acres sold for cash. The remainder wa? located with Military Warrant, College, or Indian scrip, or ap plied in the satisfaction of grants to railroads, or for other public uses The entries under the homestead law during the past year covered 901,545 acres more than those during the preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to the lull extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity of land in the market will amply supply the present demand. The claim of the settled under the Home* stead or Pre-emption laws is not, how ever, limited to lands subject to sale at private en Lit. Any unappropriated surf veyed public land tnay, to a limited amount, 1m? acquired under the former laws if the party entitled to enter under them will comply with the require ments they prescribe in regard to Ihe residence and cultivation. The actual settler's preference and right of purchase is even broader and extends to lands which were unnurveyed at the tune of bis settlement. His right was formerly confined within the most narrow limits and at one period of our history was conferred only by special statutes
