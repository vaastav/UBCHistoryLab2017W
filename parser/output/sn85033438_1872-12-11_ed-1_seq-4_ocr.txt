Horaco Maynnrd -was ono of the Committed from the Houso to wait upon tlio President nml inform him that tho two Houses of Congress were ready to re ceive his message. Col. Johji C. Buhch, of tho Union and .lmcWcccu,havingcomplctcd tho biography business, has aunouueed himself a candi date for Comptroller. Nosuprlseis mani fested. Attention is milled to a letter, publish ed elsewhere, from tho Secretary of "War, addressed to Hon. Horace Maynard. It will bo seen that Tennessee is entitled to another appointment to Weft Point after the 4th of March. Tm; indications are that Gen. John 11. (iordon will bo elected United States senator, from Georgia, to succeed Hon. Joshua F. Hill. His political disabilities were removed sometime ago, hence there is no trouble on that score. - -a I'm: Memphis Ledger comes out square ly and unequivocally for a more liberal system of frco schools. Wo think that there is no doubt of the fact that tho Leg islature which meets next month will give us such a law. Enlightened public opin ion demands it. Tin: President's message was transmit ted to New York, Philadelphia and Balti more in about forty-live minutes, which is tho shortest time ever attained with to long n document. Twelve wires wero used, and tho weather was favorable for working purposes. There were 11,330 words in the message. Hon. WahdHum", of Utica, New York, elected a few years since Justice of the Court of Appeals of the State, has been nominated by tho President for Justice of tho Supreme Court, in placo of Justice Nelson, retired. Tho nominee is said to be st man of irreproachable character and un questioned legal ability. The President, in his letter accepting Gen. Horace Porter's resignation as an officer of tho U. f. A. and Privato Secreta ry, pays him a high compliment for his services in war and peace. Gen. Porter takes ohargo of tho entire business of tho Pullman Car Compauy. It is a responsi ble position and wo hope muy provo profit able, as wo know it will, laborious. K lkv ono who has any regard for tho high social position which tho .United States holds among the .nations of the world, will endorse that part of the Presi dent's Message which relates to the Mor mons. Polygamy is an institution so mon strous, that enlightened Christian people must sutler lostt of respect in the oyes of a civilized world, while it is oven permitted. We would not favor the adoption of rash measures such as might bring about un necessary shedding of blood, but the whole ountry w'll endorse a policy looking to the extinguishment of Mormon polygamy. Inn Memphis Appeal is in a good way. It i-annot sleep, for a "war of races" is al ways llagraut in ita vivid imagination. It -ays that "whenever tho negro attempts to force himself, under the protection of an infamous law, into the dining-room of the I'eabody and Overton Hotels, nnd into tho -leeplng-cars. occupied by our wives and daughters, that moment" What do you -appose, reader? Blood knee deep the land over'.' No! "That moment," says the Appeal, "will there bo an intense hatred towards tho negro, and the strifes, which tho whole country desires to be burled, will bo renewed." Tho Apcal has our sincere sympathies. Wo are en tirely satisfied that unless speedy and Htringent legislation prevents it some plantation woman of color will yet niarry the Appeal editor. Wk are glad to see that a bill was promptly introduced into tho Houso (by Mr Harris, of Virginia), providing for a modification of the tobacco tax law as it now exists. It coutalns odious If not un just features, of which it should be divert ed. It is au Inconvenlenco and a hard ship to ,iay to small planters that they shall not sell their productions, even in small quantities to a neighbor, without in curring a penalty for the violation of the Jaw applying to retail dealers in tobacco. A great deal was said about this law dur ing the late campaign. Those who agitat ed the question then, did It for political ef fort. The people knew this and preferred to leave the matter to a senso of justice on tho part of Congress, rather than to com mit their interests into the bauds of those m whom thoy hail no confidence. We aro satisfied that' they decided correctly and that Consrej will do what 'Is right and just. 

MOURNINO FOB THE ED1T0K AND CITIZEN, Horace Greeley was fortunate hi his death. He could not havo passed away at any earlier hour of his life and havo had a whole' nation to stand mourning at his open grave. It is not alone tho sad cir cumstances of his death that provoke the universal grief that is manifested lu every section and State of our extended republic. His last Bad hours were well calculated to soften the animosities of his political oppo nents. They bridged over the temporary chasm that separated him from life-long friends and over it they passed in multitudes to express at his grave the love and admiration they bear for his unselfish, effective and unceasing battles for the good of mankind. Blotting out the unfortunate history of the past ten mouths, tho American people mourn to day for Horace Greeley as Editor and Citi zen. The tears that fill millions of eyes come forth in remembrauco of the great work he has done for mankind in the pow erful journal ho founded and built. He was always tho friend of the oppressed aud tho poor, and though in his great life work, in the zeal ho threw into his labors, he offended many by tho force and aggres siveness of his writing and speaking, he has weeping friends to-day in every creed, race or nativity in the land. From the Executive Mansion at Wash ington, from the halls of Congress, from the pulpit, from the courts of justice, from the busy marts of trade, go the best and most honored of the nation to do honor to the great journalist. The noisy, bustling streets of the metropolis of this continent arc almost hushed in presence of the sor rowful throng that gather to bear testi mony to the worth of the philanthropist. What a popular verdict of the power aud influence of the press! What striking proof that Horace Greeley, as editor, was immeasurably greater and nobler than- Horace Greeley as the candidate for Presi dent. In tho latter character he arrayed against him, and justly too,tho friends of a life time, men who had battled by his side, with all the fervor and untiring zeal of re formers, in many a hard fought campaign against oppression aud wrong. But to-day charity covers tlieerrorsof his laterdaysand lu tho memory of old associations, for the great work of a noble life, for the sake of the good that he has done, a great people grieve for tho death of tho philanthropist and journalist. In the past decade tho na tion has mourned over the fall of many of our great men and tho people have wept over the grave of many patriots, but thcro have been but few of them whose names were more familiar or whose death has awakened moro general sorrow. THE CONDITIO!? OF OUR "WORKING CLASS, If there is any one feature in our condi tion as a people, upou which we ought to congratulate ourselves above another, if is tli condition of our working class as com pared with the working classes of every other country in tho world. There is less of poverty and all its attendant evils among our working classes, than among any other working people in the civilized world. England boasts of her wealth her inexliaustiblo capital her civilization, but there capital holds arbitrary sway over a large portion of her population, and keeps them in absolute subjection. Poverty, want, disease and death are the constant companions of the working thousands in England. Low wages and uusteady em ployment is the prime cause of their de plorable condition, aud yet their misery adds to this wealth, this capital, to which they aro abject slaves. We presume that few people in this country have any ade quate Idea of the suflerings of the English working classes. .Thomas Wright, tho "Journeyman Engineer," published an article fcome time since in an English peri odical, on the condition of the working classes in Eugland, which abounds in de tails of the most sickening character. We present an extract: "Tho home life of a vnt nurabcrof tho work ing classes is something 'u thing to shudder nt, not to fee.' It is a life that puts decency, morality, and religion, ns well as physical health and comfort, out of tho question : that so degrades nnd brutnlizes those condemned to it that they live ns well as dio liko tho beasts that perish. Indeed, as a literal fact, tho poor or members of tho working classes often fare worso than tho boosts of tho field. In every requisito of health thoir dwolling aro inferior to most stables ; wo havo scon piggeries in com parison with which tho same might bo said of them ; and any master of for hounds would bo indignant if ho were asked to kennel his hounds in such foul dons for n singlo night; whilonny mastor of hounds or owner of horses, who fed his animals ns scanty as some of tho poor aro fod would bo in danger of prosecution by tho society for the prevention of cruelty to ani mals." Tho writer then proceeds to givo fads re lative to the crowded and unhealthy con dition of the miserable tenements where a largo number of tho working classes lan guish out a mlserublo existence, and un folds an almostfabulous story, when taken into consideration that all this exists in a country that boasta of its civilization. Wo might extend these quotations, but have neither space nor Inclination to do so. How different with the working jKrople of tho United States? Here, every man who is willing to work and is able to do bo, can almost invariably find employ ment at fair wages. Tho employment of working men is. reasonably steady not subject to spasmodic suspension and revival of business merely to suit tho eon veniodce of some arbitrary capitalists. Our workingnicn.uijualh; occupycpmfort-. nolo residences and thousands of them aro as well clad as the manjSf capital or tho pro fessional man. Who does not rejoice that such is tho fact! Show us a man who would so regulate business and social af fairs that a mcchanleshallbedlstlugulshcd wherever ho Is seen by tho garb he wears, and wo will show you one who would change our form of Government fo an arlB istocracy We rejoice that tho condition of American workingmen is such as it is, and trust that it may improve. We ic joico that the workingmen have such ex amples as Franklin, Wilson, Greeley, Bur- ril'tj aud a host of others, to encourage them in aspiring to wealth and dlstlnc tlon. We trust that the financial affairs of this country will bo so managed, that wages may always bo reasonable, and that workingmen will not only live comfort ably, but that facilities will continue to bo afforded them for, educating their off spring, nnd laying up in the prlmo of llfo enough of the world's goods to keep them comfortable in old age. 

COMMENTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Tho comments of the nress on tho Prnsl- dent's mefsago arc on the whole very favorable. The New York 2'imcs savs. nolhinc could be more plain or business-like and that not in twenty years has a President been able to lay before the people a more gratifying public exhibit. The Herald find.) pronounces it a irood message and a valuable State paper, brim ming over with all the vast and multifa rious concerns of the country at home and abroad. , The Tribune- ttud.t declares that it is a plain, business document, pressing some miscnievous old plans and presenting some good now ones. The Sun (Bern.) thinks it coinnion-nlare and conspicuously encouraging every measure looking towards centralization. Ihe II orM (Dem. i thinks the messaire does not show the President far-sighted. It pronounces his recommendations as gatiienng up the tail ends of spent mies- tions." The Philadelphia Press savs : No words of ours need be added in praise of the message, which is simply a calm review of tue nation's History In the last year, and a clear statement of its necessities in the next from the President's standpoint. The Missouri Democrat savs : It is plain, straightforward, business-like pa per, comprehensive in its scope, and going sufficiently into detail to convince the peo ple of tho nation that President Grant is au honest, faithful aud pains-taking guad- lan of tho public interests. The Chicago Intcr-Occan savs of it : It is marked by that straightforwardness of statement wiiicli lias characterized all the messages and public acts of President Grant, and adds to his reputation as a cnu- tious, shrewd, far-seeing statesman, who gains strength as he gains experience, and giving promise of entering upon his second term with deservedly largely increased popularity among all classes of the peo- A
