The so-called Mann white-slavery act has been severely criticised as extending federal jurisdiction far bevond the "white slave" trafTu, and therefore beyond the original purpose in framing the law.

Since the law went into efTect, 60a persons have been convicted under it, their total sentences in jail ag gregating more than 1000 years, the average sentence being between ono and two years. n i ocumugitticli From Fiidiiys Daily The only business transacted by the county commissioners at Mon day's meeting outside of the regu lar routine was the appointment of II.

H3RSE Having heard somn advert com ment on Mr Mi Mur r. 's bill for taV ingcare ot the horse that t gured in the McCemb ctse we lookd up the 1511 toiiay and found the followirg items: "October 9 to December 1, guarding and keeper t f horse in McComb case; in charge 6'J dayr days at $3 perday $159 00 Hay 16 25 Chain .30 $171) 55." When the costs of the trial are added to this amount, this ho.-_e will prove a very costly one to the taxpayers. Yet money sp-n* in ferreting out crime is well bpont, though it proves a costly luxury. ABE THEY EXTRAVAGANT? Th. county commissioners are fast getting a reputation f r ex travagance. Whether or not they deserve the reputation, is a ques tion that we are not wholly prepar ed to answer at this tirre. as we know very little of their work dur ing the year. But from what we have seen since October, we havt! no hesitancy in saying that the criticisms heard wnenevcr taxpay ers discuss county affairs have a solid base t) rest upon. The bill allowed for the care of the horse that figured in the Mr Comh rase is one that lends strong ly to support the charge of extrav agance. The writer learned that when thi? horse was firnt br< jght to Elko she was cared for by Sheriff Harris at 50 cents a day a r four days. Tho horse w a tnen taken from the Sheriff's eare and placed in marne of a keeper at $3 per day and f.rd furnished. The Commissioners mav not be rr.-pon sible lor this arrangement as we understand it was the act of the district attorney and the other at torneys in ti e fa c, But be tl is as it may the commissioner, tret the blame for allowing $3 a tiay to a keeper for 53 d;iys for caring for her. It looks to the average man as if this animal could have been just as well taken care of nnd jusr as safely kept for all tho purpost. of the trial for very much less money. Another source of omplain , l;< the expenao hill., allowed nc road supervisor. The November Mil will . be found elsewhere. It should t> read and studied by the taxpayer <. j From thi Items of the November bill it will bo s en that the c nty pavr for washing the automobile and for everything needed in keep ing It in repair. It will also be seen that for an "expensive" ma chine it nerds a great dial of fixing every month. For the three months it has been used by the road super visorCthe billu ter repairs, oil, ete. j amount to over $300, or over $100 a per month. This added to the sal- i si v makes the cost of this officer i $250 per month. We h?.ve so intention of critieia- a ing 'he work of the road supervie- i or aa we know nothing about it i but we do think that he should keep his own machine in repair. . Some people who pay taxes say | that the county is paying alto gether too much money in settling Mr. Agee's private grievances. As proof of this they point to bis trouble with Sam Bacbman that , cost the county a snug sum. We , believe Mr. Agce is entitled to the j same protecton as other citizens | and nu mure. His property should , have all the protection accorded by j the law to all citizens. If the , prosecutions he brings are based on ( personal spite, and brought to ( wreak personal vengeance, he is un- , worthy of any protection. But this ( we cannot believe. ROBBED WHILE ASLEEP ; James H. Harding, a telegraph , opera'or from Chicago, came to ( Elko Wednesday to get a job, wit 1 the Couthen Pacific. He stopped ;it the rooming house over the De pot Saloon, opposite the Western Pacific pa&penger depot. While asleep about 3 o'clock this morning he was awakened by some one go ing through his clothes. Harding tackled the man and heat him up badly, but the fellow got away with $50, and an old pocketbook, hut left the contents, consisting of cards and letters, and a can of Prince Albert tobacco. When Hard ing woke up and saw what was go ing on ne siezed a bucket ot water and thr^W it in the fellow's face and then jumped hin>. He describes the thief as being a medium sized man about 25 years of age, wearing a dirty black hat and a greenish looking coat. He says he would like to meet the fellow today and finish the job he began at 3 o'clock this morning. Harding has been in the employ of the Western Pacific at Spring Garden. California. ? ? ? ? - ?
