IHE PRESIDENT'S • CAUSES OF THE PRESENT FINAN CIAL CONDITIONS IS MADE THE CHIEF TOPIC. SUGGESTS REMEDIES FOR ILLS CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS AND RAILROADS TO PREVENT OVERCAPITALIZATION. ©elieves This Would Solve the Prob lem Together with Provision for More Elastic Currency—Recom mends Postal Banks and Asks for Legislation Along Many Lines. Washington. Dec. 3. — President Roosevelt's annual message to congress a voluminous document of nearly 30,00# words, by far the longest sage he has ever submitted to congress. The opening subject of the message is the financial condition of the country, *nd for which the president lays much at the blame upon unscrupulous stock «peculators, and says: "In any large body of me*v however, certain to be some who are there dishonest, and if the conditions are *uch that»these men prosper mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these «ess men of great sagacity and of tem perament both unscrupulous and reck less, and where the conditions are such that they act without supervision or •control and at flrst without effective check from public opinion, they delude many innocent people into making in vestments or embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successful ly dishonest men ferlng comes not only upon them, but the innocent ' "in are busi discovered, suf whom they upon jiave misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer ^are apt to forget that the longer it deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so possible to minimize the dis tress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is not possible to lefrain because of such distress from «trlving to put that are the ultimate causes of the suf fering, and, where possible to punish those j-e «ponslble for them. There may be hon est differences of opinion as to many governmental policies; but surely there be no such differences as to the need of unflinching perseverance In the war against successful dishonesty." He. quotes, at length from his mes sage of laßt year in which he advo cated federal control of corporations •doing interstate business, and believes that in such control would be found the remedy for overcapitalization and .stock speculation w'hich he belieV have brought about the present finan cial conditions. He says: "Our steady aim should be by legis lation, cautiously and carefully under taken, but resolutely persevered in. to ■assert the sovereignty of the national government by affirmative action. far end to the misdeeds a means to this end, "This is only in form arj innovation. In substance it is merely a restoration; ■for from the earliest tl lion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies; and all that I propose 1s to meet the changed conditions in •uch manner such régula will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it has always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also in England before and alnce this country bee,: nation. a separate Federal Control of Knilroad« I« Favored. "No small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self-re liance. of Independence In inltiati *nd action. It is wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for its fullest «reise, compatible with seeing that lib «rty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately, this is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably breeds. The founders of the constitution pro vided that the national government should have complete and sole control «f interstate commerce. I; then practically save such as was conducted by water, and this the national government at ' -once proceeded to regulate in thorough going and effective fashion. Condi . tions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce by water is in significant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big [■' Tmsiness concerns are now engaged in Interstate commerce. As a result, it can be but partially and imperfectly controlled or regulated by the action of *ny one of the several states; such ac tion inevitably tending to be either too else too lax, and In either There interstate business -drastic : case Ineffective for purposes of justice. •Only the national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any extension of tederal authority, for such authority ' Already exists under the constitution in P amplest and most far-reaching form; V but It does mean that there should be 1 an extension of federal activity. This ! 1s not advocating centralization. It is ' merely looking facts in the face, and ! Tealizing that centralization in business |- has already come and can not be avoid I ed or undone, and that the public at gv. large can only protect itself from II tain evil effects of this business I tralization by providing better methods I tor the exercise of control through the £ -authority already centralized in the ^ national government by the constitu :/ tion itself. There must be no halt In the healthy constructive course of ac ^ tion which this nation has elected to Pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur ing the last six years. shown both In [K? the legislation of the congress and the administration of the law by the de partment of justice. The most vital need is in connection with the railroads. As to these, in my judgment there »hould now be either a national Incor poration act ; companl Pierce u • -should be a law licensing railway to engage in interstate pon certain conditions. The law to give to the Interstate commerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of securi ties, while ample means should be pro vided to enable the commission, when ever In Its Judgment It is necessary, to tnake a physical valuation of any rail road. framed As I stated in my message to the congress a year ago, railroads should ■ e given power to 1er into agree ments, subject to these agreements be ing made publlo in minute detail and to the consent ramml«i nn ? r , the Interstnt* commerce thé „f.? b ? ln ® flrs ' obtained.

It is profoundly immoral the statute books a law, nominally In the interest of public moral 1 ui* really P u ts a premium upon bhc immorality, by undertaking to turbid henest jnen from doing what must be done under modern business condi tions, so that the law itself provides that its own infraction must be the condition precedent upon business success. To aim at the accomplishment of too much usu ally means the accomplishment of too lit tle, and often the doing of positive dam age. "The antitrust law should not be pealed; but it should be made both more efficient and more In harmony with act ual conditions. It should be so amended as to forbid only the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be an incident of, a grant of pervlsory power to tho government these big corporations engaged in inter state business, panied by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjec tion of books and papers to the inspec tion of the government officials. A be ginning has already been made for such supervision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations. "The antitrust law should not prohibit combinations that do no injustice to the public, still less those the existence of which is on the whole of benefit to the public# But even if this feature of the law were abolished, there would remain an equally objectionable feature the difficulty and delay now incident to its enforcement. The government must now submit to irksome and repeated delays before obtaining a final decision of the courts upon proceedings instituted, and even a favorable decree may mean empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to control these corporations by lawsuits means to impose upon both the depart ment of justice and the courts possible burden; it is not feasible to carry more than a limited number of such suits. Such a law to be really effective must of course be administered by an executive body, and not merely by means of lawsuits. The design should be to prevent the abuses incident to the crea tion of unhealthy and improper combina tions, Instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to de stroy them by civil or criminal proceed ings. a to en I • 1 put keep re This should be accom Mil Investing Public Should Be Amply Safeguarded. "The congress has the power to charter corporations to engage In interstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted under the provisions of which existing corporations could take out fed eral charters and tiops could be created. An essential pro vision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by some federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter combination within the restrictions of the federal law. Provision should also be made for complete publicity in all matters affecting the public and complete protec tion to the Investing public and the share holders In the matter of Issuing corporate securities. If an incorporation law is not deemed advisable, a license act for big Interstate corporations might be enacted; a combination of the two might he tried. The supervision established might be analogous to that national banks. At least, the antitrust act should be supplemented by specific prohibitions of the methods which perience has shown have been of most service in enabling monopolistic combina tions to crush out competition. Tho real owners of a corporation should be com pelled to do business In their The right to hold stock in other corpora tions should heareafter be denied to inter state corporations, unless on approval by the proper government officials, and a prerequisite to such approval should be the llstirife with the government of all owners and stockholders, both by the corporation owning such stock and by the corporations in which such stock is owned. "To confer upon the national govern ment, In connection with the amendment I advocate In the antitrust law, power of supervision over big business concerns engaged In interstate commerce, would benefit them tional banks, criàis lt is noteworthy that the Institu tion* which failed were Institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the national government. Those which were under national trol stood the test. "National control ôf the kind above ad vocated would be to the benefit of every well-managed railway. From the stand point of the public there is need for ad ditional tracks, aditlonal terminals, and improvements In the actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly possible. Ample, safe, and speedy trans portation facilities are even more neces sary than cheap transportation. There fore, there Is need for the Investment of money which will provide for all these things while at the same time securing is possible better wages and shorter hours for their employes. There fore, while there must be just and rea sönable regulation of rates, the first to protest against any arbitrary and unthinking movement to cut them down without the fullest and most care ful consideration of all Interests cerned and of the actual needs of., the situation. Only a special body of men acting for the national government un der authority conferred upon It by the congress Is competent to pass judgment on such a matter. Greater Elasticity I» Currency I» Urged. The president quotes extensively from hi« last message it dealing with the dl federal corpora association or exercised it has benefited the In the recent business fas should be rect subject or currency legislation, and says : "I again urge on the congress the need of immediate attention to this matter. We need a greater elasticity in rency; provided, of course, that we recog nize the greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the tional authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. The emergency Issue should, of made with t, course. effective guaranty, and up conditlons carefully prescribed by the government. Such emergency issue must adequate securities approved by the government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being Issued when the demand for it was urgent, while securing Its re tirement worth investigating to determine whether offerers and directors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to them selves. Trust companies should be sub ject to the same supervision legislation to this effect should be en acted for the District of Columbia and the territories. be based the demand fell off. It is banks; "Yet the wisest legislation must also remember thkt even the subject only accomplish a certain amount, legislation can by any possibility guar antee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than it can guarantee an individual against the results of his extravagance. When an in dividual mortgages his house to buy an automobile he invites disaster; and when wealthy No who pose as such, are unscrupulously or foolishly eager to become such. Indulge in reckless spec ulation—especially If It is accompanied by dishonesty—they jeopardize not only their future but the future of all their in nocent fellow-citizens, for they expose the whole business community to panic and distress." , or He advises against any general tariff legislation this session of congress, and says; "In a country of such phenomenal growth ns ours It Is probably well that every dozen years should be carefully scrutinized see that no excessive or improper bene fits are conferred thereby, that proper revenue is provided, foreign trade is must always be a tariff which will low for the collection of an enue but which will at least make good the difference in cost of production here and abroad; that is, the difference in the labor cost here and abroad, for the well-being of the wage-worker must ever be a cardinal point of American policy. The question should be npproached pure ly from a business standpoint; both the time and the manner of the change being such as to arouse the minimum of agi tation and disturbance in the business world, and to give the least play for selfish and factional motives. The sole consideration shoutd be to see that the sum total of changes represent the pub lic good. This means that the subject cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a presidential election, .be cause as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time it is Impossible to get men to treat It from the standpoint of the public good. In my Judgment the wise time to deal with the matter 1« Immediately after such elec tion." He asks for the repeal of the tariff on paper and wood pulp. He reviews and enlarges upon his pre vious recommendations for the enact ment of federal inheritance and income tax law's. Attention Is called to the prosecution of wealthy offenders against the national laws, and in thifc connection he asks that the laws under which these prosecutions brought be strengthened and made more definite. the tariff laws to >0 and that our encouraged. There minimum not only ;i I pie The It Abuse of Injunction«. nnd the "Instances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in labor disputes continue to occur, and the resentment in the minds of those who feel that their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrantably restrained continues to grow-. Much of the attack on the use of the process of injunction is wholly without warrant; but I am strained to express the belief that for some of it there is warrant. This ques tion is becoming more and more of prime importance, and unless the courts will themselves deal with it in effective man ner, it is certain ultimately to demand some form of legislative action. It would be most unfortunate for our social wel fare If we should permit many honest and law-abiding citizens to feel that they had just cause for regarding courts with hostility. I earnestly mend to the attention of the congress this matter, so that some way may be devised which will limit the abuse of in junctions and protect those rights which from time to time it unwarrantably in vades. Moreover, discontent is often ex pressed with the use of the process of injunction by the courts, not only in la bor disputes, but where state laws concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question will supreme court." Of other legislation in the interest of labor he favors federal inspection of rail roads; providing limited but definite pensatlon for accidents to all workmen employed in any way by the government, and says: "The constitutionality of the employers' liability act passed by the preceding gress has been carried before the courts. In two jurisdictions the law has been de clared unconstitutional, and In three juris dictions its constitutionality has been af firmed. The question has been carried tc tn© supreme court, the case has been heard by that tribunal, and a decision is expected at an early date. In the event tbat the court should affirm the consti tutionality of the act, I urge further leg islation along the lines advocated in my message to the preceding congress. Tho practice of putting the entire burden ot loss of life or limb upon the victim or tne victim's family is a form of social in justice in which the United States stunds in unenviable prominence. In both federal and our state legislation we have, with few exceptions, scarcely gone farther than the repeal of the fellow servant principle of the old law of liabil ity, and in some of our states even this slight modification of a complete out grown principle ha« not yet been cured." He favors the extension of the eight hour law to all departments of the gov ernment, and to all work carried on by the government. He urges legislation for the compulsory investigation of In dustrial disputes, and says: "The neèd for some provision for such forcibly illustrated A strike of I am informed that it receive the consideration of the investigation during the past summer, telegraph • operators seriously Interfered with telegraphic communication, caus ing great damage to business interests and serious inconvenience eral public from many parts of the country, from city councils, from boards of trade, from chambers of commerce, and from labor organizations, urging that steps be taken to terminate the strike. Everything that could with any pro priety be done by a representative of the government was done without avail, and for weeks the public stood by and suffered without recourse of any kind. Had the machinery existed and had there been authority for compulsory investigation of the dispute, the public would have been placed in possession of the merits of the controversy, and public opinion would probably have brought about prompt adjustment.

To fall to stop these prac tices l>y legislation means to. force Into them, because* oth wise the dishonest who take advantage of of be reached without honest rely will them will have everything their own way. If the states will correct these evils. cell and good; but the nation must stand ready to aid them. Inland Waterway System« Should Be Ueevloped. "The conservation of our national sources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which under lies almost every other problem of national life. We must maintain for civilization the adequate material basis without which that civilization cannot exist. We must show foresight. must look ahead. As a nation not only enjoy a wonderful measure of present prosperity but If this prosper ity is u«ed aright lt la an earnest of future success such will have. The reward of foresight fot this nation is great and easily foretold. But there must be the look ahead, there must be a realization of the fact that to waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as to Increase its usefulness, will, result in undermining in the days of prosperity which hand down to them amplified and devel oped. For the last few years, through several agencies, the government has been endeavoring to get our people to look ahead and to substitute a planned and orderly development of our sources in place of a haphazard striv ing for immediate profit. Our great river systems should be developed national water highways; the Missis sippi. with It« tributaries, standing flrst in importance, and the Columbia ond, although there are many others of importance on the Pacific and Atlantic and the gulf slopes. The national gov ment should undertake this work, and I hope a beginning will be made In the present congress; and the great est of nil our rivers, the Mississippi, should receive especial attention. From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep wa terway. with deep waterways leading from it to the east and the west. Such a waterway would practically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart of our country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our people. If begun at once lt can be carried through ift tlmo appreciably to relieve the gestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. The work should be systematically and continuously carried forward in accordance with some well conceived plan. The main streams should be Improved to the highest point of efficiency before the Improve ment of the branches is attempted; and the work should be kept free from every taint of recklessness or Jobbery." Attention is called to the work of ir rigation and reclamation of govern ment lands. In the same connection he asks for a revision of the public land laws along the lines proposed by the public lands commission. Believes the government should increase its efforts to conserve our forests and should in crease by purchase the existing forest preserves. On the subject of the natural resources of the nation he says; "In the eastern United, States the mineral fuels have already passed into the hands of large private those of the west It is obvious that these fuels should be conserved and not wasted, and it would be well to protect the people against unjust and extortionate prices, so far that can still be done. What has been accomplished in the great oil fields of the Indian Territory by the action of the administration offers a striking example of the good results of such a policy. In my Judgment the government should have the right to keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas fields In its own possession and to lease the rights to develop them under proper regulations; or else, if the gress will not adopt this method, the coal deposits should be sold under lim itations. to conserve them ns public utilities, the right to mine coal being separated from the title to the soil. The regulations should permit coal lands to be worked in sufficient quan tity by the several corporations. The present limitations have been absurd, excessive, and serve no useful purpose, and often render it necessary that there should be either fraud or else abandonment of the work of getting out the coal." l'rogre«« of the Work On the Panama Canal. of other nation children the very ought by right to . and rapidly following. canal is pro a highly satisfactory In March ttae total excavation In effort 815.270 cubic increased to "Work on the Pana, ceeding I the Culebra Cut. where chiefly concentrated, w yards. In April this 879.527 cubic yards. There w siderable decrease In the output for May and June owing partly to the ad vent of the rainy season and partly to temporary trouble with the steam shovel men over the question of wages. This trouble was settled satisfactorily to all parties and in July the total cavation advanced materially and in August the grand total from all points in the canal prism by steam shovels and dredges exceeded all previous United States records, reaching 1,274. 404 cubic yards. In September this ord w 412 cubic yards amount 1,481,307 cubic yards were from the canal prism nnd 36.105 cubic yards were from accessory works. These re sults were achieved in the rainy with a rainfall In August of 11.89 Inches and in September of 11.65 inches. Finally, in October, the record again eclipsed, the total excavation be ing 1,868,729 cubic yards; a truly traordinary record, especially in view of the heavy rainfall, which Inches. In fact, last two rainy seasons demonstrates that the rains are a less serious ob stacle to progress than has hitherto been supposed. "Work on the locks and dams at Gatun. which began actively in March last, has advanced so far that it is thought that masohry work loots can be begun within 15 months. "Last winter bids were requested and received for doing the work of canal construction by contract. None of them was found to be satisfactory and all were rejected. It is the unanimous opinion of the present commission that the work can be done better, more cheaply, and more quickly by the gov ernment than by private contractors. Fully 80 per cent, of the entire plant needed for construction has been pur chased or contracted for; mach! shops have been erected and equipped for making all needed repairs to the plant; many thousands of employes have been secured; an effective organi zation has been perfected; a recruiting system is in operation which is capable of furnishing more labor than can be used advantageously; employes are well sheltered and well fed; salaries paid not only going forward smoothly, but lt is producing results far in advance of the most sanguine anticipations. Under these favorable conditions, a change In tho method of prosecuting the work would be unwise and unjusti fiable, for It would Inevitably disorgan U .1 s eclipsed and a total of 1.517, removed.

These recom mendations have been drawn up to benefit the farmer and the ■ of of ntry storekeeper; otherwise, I should not favor them, for I believe that It is good policy for government to do every thing possible to aid the small town and the country district. It is desirable that the country merchant should not be crushed out.

The president devotes much space to the affairs of the army, and strongly urges that our regular military organi zation be kept up to the highest possible standard of efficiency, and says: "The medical corps should be much greater than the needs of our regular army in war. Yet at present it is small er than the needs of the service demand even in peace. The Spanish war curred less than ten years ago.

The president asks for a eontlnuou» increase in the navy, and asks present congress for appropriations for four battleships, and says: "We need always to remember that in tlmè of war the navy is not to b* used to defend harbors and sea-coast cities; we should perfect our system of coast fortifications. The only efficient use for the navy is for offense, only way in which it tect our action of a foreign navy Is by destroy ing that foreign navy. For defens* against a hostile fleet whlcA actually attacks them, the coast cities Must de* pend upon their forts, mines, torpedoes, submarines nnd torpedo boats hnd de stroyers. All of these together are ef ficient for defensive purposes, b tt they in no way supply th© place of e. thor oughly efficient navy Capable of acting on the offensive; for parrying never yet won n fight. It can only be won by hard hitlng. and an aggressive sea-go ing navy alone can do this hard hitting of the offensive type. But the fort* and the like are necessary so that th* navy may be footloose. In time of war there is sure to be demand, under pres sure of fright, ftir the ships to be scat tered so as to defend all kind of ports. Under penalty of terrible disaster, thl» demand must be refused. The ship» must be kept together, and their ob jective made the enemies' fleet. If fortifications are sufficiently strong, modern navy will venture to attack them, so long as the foe has in exist ence a hostile navy of anything Ilk* the same size or efficiency. But unies» there exists such a navy then the forti fications are powerless by themselves re the victory. For of cours* the mere deficiency means that any resolute enemy can at his leisure bine all his forces upon one point with the certainty that ho Give« Henson* for Despatch Of Flret to the l'aclflc. "Until our battle fleet is much larger than nt present It should never be split into detachments so far apart that they could not in event of emergency b* speedily united. Our coast line is on the Pacific Just as much as on the At lantic. Tho interests of California. Oregon and Washington phatically the interests of the whola union as those of Maine and New York, of Louisiana and Texas. Tho battl* fleet should now and then be moved to the Pacific, just as at other times it should be kept in tho Atlantic. When the Isthmian canal Is built the transit of the battle fleet from one ocean to tho other will be comparatively easy. Until it is bullt I earnestly hope that the battle fleet will be thus shifted be tween the two oceans every year or two. The marksmanship on all our ships has improved phenomenally dur ing the last five years. Until within the Inst two or three years It was not possible to train a battle fleet In squad ron maneuvers under service conditions, and it is only during these last two or three years that the training under these conditions has become really ef fective. Another and most necessary stride in advance is now being taken* 'ihe battle fleet is about starting by the Straits of Magellan to visit th* Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships ar* going under the command of Rear Ad miral Ev cruisers and two other battleships will meet him at San Francisco, whither certain torpedo destroyers are also go ing. No fleet of such size has ever made such a voyage, and it will be of very great educational gaged in it. The only way by which to teach officers and men how to handl* the fleet so as to meet every possibl* strain and emergency in time of war i» to have them practice under similar conditions In time of peace. Moreover, the only way to find out needs is to perform In time of peac* whatever maneuvers might be neces sary in time of war. After dared lt is too late to find out th* needs; that means to invite disaster. The trip to the Pacific will show what some of our needs are and will enabl* us to provide for them. The proper place for an officer to learn his duty is at sea. and the only way In which & ever be made efficient is by . under all the condl Th* efficiently pro coast -against the possibl* to take lt. while eight armored to all actual is de navy practice at tions which would have to be met if war existed."
