The only business trans acted was the reading of the President's message, which occupied two and a quar ter hours. It is a lengthy document, con sisting of 18,000 words. We have as yet only read portions relating to the tariff and the financial question. The Presi dent endorses Secretary Carlisle's finan cial policy. He Bays bonds cannot be depended upon to support the gold re serve, and that there mut be an elastic currency. He favors the repeal of the 10 per cent, tax on State banks. He favors free coal and iron and the abolition of all protection to refineries of sugar. Thoso who hoped the President would outline some bold policy that would have a bearing upon the future of party or ganization are disappointed. It was a great opportunity and Grover Cleveland did not improve it. Wo give the message entire in a sup plement and trust every ono will read it. The Baptist State Convention is in ses sion this week at the Tryon Street Bap tist church. The first session was held Thursday night with an introductory ser mon by the Rev. C. W.

FROM OUR RALEIGH CORRESPONDENT. Raleigh, N C, Dec. 3, 1894. The State boaid of canvassers got at work last Friday and two entire days were consumed in the canvass of the judi cial vote. This was due to the fact that there were three sets of returns from Nash county, these being known as the original, a fraudulent copy and a cor rected copy. Ono set of these returns was stolen from the office of the clerk of the court and altered without his knowl edge, and he certified it and sent it here. But when he found that it was erroneous be at once sent another return and there on made a statement to the Secretary of State. The board of canvassers was urged by the counsel for C. M. Bernard, fusion nominee for Solicitor in the Third dis district, to accept the last return. Coun sel for John E. Woodard, the Democratic nominee, argued that the board cannot hear ovidence to determine the authen ticity and genuineness of the returns, but that if a paper is presented as a return and a question is made as to whether it is a return or not, the board must decide the question from what appears on the face of the paper itself. The board de cided to accept the original return. It was asked to subpoena a witness from Nash, but declared that it bad no such right, and further tbat it had no right to hear evidence and correct clerical errors. The clerical errors were numerous, and some of them reflect no credit on the county boards, as initials of names are in some cases wrong, names are put down on wrong columns. Thus men voted for in the Third district are put down on the Fourth district. By a clerical error Hubert Carter, Democratic nominee for Judge in the 12th district, lost 20,000 votes. These are recorded as cast for "Herbert Carter. Both fusionists and Democrats lo&t votes in this way ; one fusionist losing 10,000 The State board proceeded with great care. Its powers are extremely limited. It has no right to go behind the returns. It appears that the nominees for Chief Justice led their respective tickets. The vote for Shepherd is 127,593, and for Fair- cloth 148,434. making the latter's major ity being 20,841. The total vote cast is 276.027 Two years atro the total vote was 280,500. The falling off in the vote was not so great as was thought. Jus tice Shepherd came in 8,000 votes of get ting as many votes as did Gov. Carr. The Republicans and populists two years ago polled 143,524 votes. They thus gained this year o,UUU. Iben two years ago 2,457 votes were cast for the prohibition candidate for Governor, while this year the prohibitionists bad no candidate Walter Clark got 272,070 votes, or 4,000 less than the total cast. MacRae got 12 J, 466, Furches 145,219; Burwell 125,574, Montgomery 144,909. The six fusion nominees for Judges are all elected. Six fusion Solicitors are elected and four Democrats. On the face of the returns the Democratic Solicitors get in from the 3rd and 7th districts. The Congressional vote shows that in the First district Harry Skinner, fusion ist, has 2964 majority over Branch; that in the Third district Shaw, Democrat, has 994 over Cyrus Thompson, populist, and that in tho Ninth Pearson, fusionist, has only 135 over Crawford. Up to yesterday the vote of Ashecoun- tv for State Treasurer had not been re- ceived. This was the only missing re turn. The number of " visiting statesmen,' nearly all of the Republican faith, has been extremely large during the past few days. The ostensible cause of their as semblage was to be present at the count of votes. But really it was to comer, Republican Chairman Holton says there is not a particle of truth in the statement that Republicans are planning to elect two Republican Senators. He says there will be one populist and one itepublican and that Marion Butler will be the popu list. Jeter C. Pritcbard is absolutely sure that he will be the Republican Senator. This appears to be the opinion of the great majority of Republicans who will talk about the matter. Marion Butler was the only populist present at the conference. In fact he is the only prominent popuust in me otaie. The Republicans do not care to deal with any others, since he has the power and t ho Rhi nv to BDeaK absolutely ior nis j r t party. The conterence has agreed tnat iusion s to continue "co-operation" is the offi cial name of it. It is also agreed that there shall be loint caucuses on most suhiefits: ouite probably on Senator. It will be a simple way or showing now tne fusionists null together. All the talk of disagreements, present and possible, are idle, your correspondent is assured Dy both the fusion chairmen. The truth is that tho Democrats have erot to get together, and face the fusion music in 1896. Tho same tunes will be played. The amount of money thus far received for the State's Confederate monument is $17,000. of which the ladies have raised $7,000. The monument is to cost $25,- 000, so $8,000 must be raised and that speedily, as May 20th the monument is to be unveiled. Such is now the under standing. The delivery of stone, cut at Mt. Airy, is to begin this week, the presi dent of the ladies monument association tells me. All the stone is ready. The finely carved stone is at Baltimore and will be sent here at once. The bronze statuary, etc., cast in Germany, is fin ished and is to arrive in January. It is to cost, by contract, $11,000 of the $25 000. This week some 50 convicts go from the penitentiary to the farms on the Roanoke. Arrivals of convicts have been unusually numerous at the peni tentiary. The Progressive Farmer today in an editorial very earnestly urges the new Legislature to establish a reformatory for youthful criminals. This will certainly be a popular movement. At tho Baptist State Convention at Charlotte this week the question of State aid to the University will be delicately handled, so says Editor Bailey, of the Biblical Recorder. It is not probable that the Legislature will take away the appropriation. There will be a pretty contest over the speakership of the house. Lusk, Walser and Ewart are chiefly named. The letter can have it it be will accept it, so some Republicans of prominence say. It ap pears to be quite well understood that a Republican is to get this position. The number of cadets at the A. & M. College is now 215. Of these 160 are in the battalion. All will not be uniformed until next month. The railway commission gives an opio ion in a case in which a man who sent a 0 word message from Wilson to Eliza beth Citv was made to pay 50 cents for it by the Western Union telegraph com- -WW mm 1 - fTt ft pany. lie paid unaer protest. ins company claimed tbat it bad no! line to Edenton, but that the only line was operated by a railway. The commission finds this statement to be untrue, and orders the 25 cents excess to be refunded and also orders the company to desist rom further violation of the law. There is great and general regret all over the State at the retirement of Maj. John C. Winder, from the service of the Seaboard Air-Line which he bad served so long, ably and zealously. He retired, it is learned, because be was urea oi tne exacting duties of his position as vice. president, which kept him away Irom bis borne and lamily almost au tne time. Marion Butler tells me there will be in t he Senate 6 Democrats. 29 populists. 15 Republicans; and in the house 47 popu- - . a- m m ft AA I X lists, 6i republicans ana csy aemocraus; total 45 Democrats, 76 populists and 49 .republicans. The annual report of the Mate buper intendentof Public Instruction for 1894, just completed, shows receipts $767,802, . . m A M AfkN 1 1 J disbursements 5Y4,zcm; Daiance on uauu in 1893, $224,228; balaoce now on hand $195,769; number of whites of school age (b to2n 3y,709, enroiiea Zdo.ieo; col ored of school age 212,191, enrolled 123,- 899. There are 4356 white school houses and 2010 colored. The valuation of white school property is $817,148, colored $301, 149. The average length of school terms is 13 weeks. Average salary of teachers of country schools white males $25.50, females $23 08; colored males $23,08, females $19.27. The ' State County Fair," by the young ladies of the Normal and Indus trial school, at Greensboro, Friday night was a unique entertainment. The Ral. eigh Observer correspondent writes of the representations, we quote a few : "Tho voung lady who represented Greene county had . not only an artistic fcense of the fitness of things, but she was plucky, and she made the hit of the evening when she appeared bearing on her shoulders a squealing, struggling pig and wearing a string of corn in the ear, strung to her dress, representing the "hog and hominy" interests oi Crreene. Another representative of the "Emerald County" carried a banner, which doubt less made the Wake county girls quake at their narrow escape, for it bore on its face the legend : 44 Snow Hill, in this county, came within one vote of being the Capital oi JNorth Carolina. It is needless to say the Uurbam coun tv delegation carried a banner with a handsome "Durham Bull" pictured on it, and another girl made the mourns oi tne men water with her necklace oi cigars and a husro bag of smoking toBacco. - Buncombe county claimed the honor of the birth place ot Vance, owain ana Merrimon. Mecklenburg, progressive Mecklenburg with her wealth and intelligence, was reDresented by girls, clad in black and white crowns, the black gowns having stripes of silver around the skirts of the dress and little black wings peeped out trom the shoulders, these were nornets, and a young woman earned a hornets nest. Of course the Declaration of In- denendence was along too. The toilettes of this delegation were the most elaborate of all and they stood a good chance of winning tne prize.
