The Fire Losses during the year amounted to $34 223 83. an Increaie of $10,842 63 over the losses of 14)09. Classified as to Kind of Property de stroved, the Fire Losses were: Barns $ 14,978 18 Dwellings 7.920 70 Stores 6 031 70 Printing Office 2.170 00 Electric Plant 2.000(H) Tenant Houses 1,626 00 Live Stuck killed by lightning 463 26 Hay Stuck 60 00 Outbuildings 60(H) Church 20 00 Canning Moos* 6 00 $ 34 223 83 ClsHsified as to Cause of Fire, the Fire Losses were: Unknown $ 9,272 08 Incendiary. 3.696 00 Defective Blcctrtc Wiring 3,234 42 Carelessness of Smokers 2.626 00 Lightning 2,236 61 Gasoline Engine. 2.000 00 Friction Match in Thresher .. 1,967 36 Defective Flues and Chimneys 1,963 34 Overheated Stoves and Chimneys 1.673 88 Children playing with fire 1,361 00 Coal Oil Lamps and Stoves... 1,326 76 Caught from Adjacent Build ings 1.066 00 Upsetting Lantern in Barn.... 941 60 Sparks from Unscreened Engine Stacks 676 00 Sparks from Chimneys on Roof 80400 Head of Match Breaking oil.. 10 OO Burning Men's Nest in Stable 2 00 $34,223 83 As heretofore, the greatest loss was on Barns, and the cause of the fires were in most cases reported as unknown. It is safe to assume, however, that most barn fires arc due to smokers and the careless handbag of UnUroi. There were three fires of supposed In cendiary origin. In one case, through the help of the State Fire Marshal, the guilty parties were discovered and prose cutcd. The loss on Dwellings was principally due to Defective Flues and Chimneys, Overheated Stoves and Coal 0.1 Lamps Much attention has been given to the in spection of chimneys and stovepipes, and several new risks have leen declined he cause of faulty construction and arrange ment. The Company's experience shows that poorly constructed chimneys and improperly located stove pipes, while perhaps cheap In the t>eglnning, in the end prove most expensive to both insurer and insured. The damage from Lightning was com paratively small. The BxerutlveOfficers hare been frequently asked whether lightning rods were a protection, and whether lower rates would lie given when rods were used. The Company makes no lower rates on buildings so protected t>ecause no reliable statistics have ever been secured to Justify a reduction We can only say that the argument of th* Lightning Rod Agent sounds plausible and it may be safer to have buildings rodded. We do know, however, that poorly insulated rods orroddingallowed to get out of repair are worse than no protection. The fire caused by a gasoline engine was due to (he location of the exhaust pipe r.ear woodwork This oversight cost the Company $2,000. Defective Electric Wiring is given n the cause of two fires, the loss on which amounted to over $3,000. The carelessness of smokers leaving u lighted cigar or cigarette in a public hall over a store caused a loss of over $2,600 In the list of causesof fires (heone that would seem to have the greatest possl bilitles resulted In the smallest lons While burning may he a moat effective way of breaking up a hen's nest in a barn or stable, such methods are neither recommended nor approved by the Com pany. The small loss In this instance can only he due to that Providential oversight which Is said to take care of small children. Inebriates and lunatics Because of this classification it is thought heat not to mention the sex of the nest burner. The only securities purchased during the year were $1,600 of Bel Air Water St Light Company Bonds, and $1,600 of Hazard Wharf Company Honda Both Honda bear five per cent. Interest and were bought at par. As funds are now available the Finance Committee will douhtlras make some in vestment within the next month Circumstances have required that the work ot the Inspector and the Adjustor should Ik combined. Mr. McCormick has been filling both positions for the past two years. The plan haa resulted In greater efficiency without increase of expenae to the Company. It Is the Company's object to furnish Fire Insurance to its members at the lowest possible coat. By furnishing in surance we do not mean merely the de livery of an attractive looking policy and the collection of a Rmall premium therefor. The price of the policy la, of courae, an important Item, hut the true test of an Insurance Company is the kind of settlement with the assured when a fire occurs. In adjusting losses the Har ford Mutual never takes advantage of mere technicalities, but endeavors to carry out Its contract in spirit as well as In letter. We are sometimes met with tbc state ment that other Companies write loaur ance cheaper. We haye never been told that any other Company makes fairer settlements of fire lossca. For details of the Company'* opera tions during the past year attention ia called to the attached report of the Sec retary and Treasurer, and to the report of the Inspector. The more the figures are studied by the members the better satisfied they will be a* to the Company’s condition. Respectfully submitted. Richard Dai.i.au, President The Secretary’s report is the statistical statement of (be Company and will by dqly published. The Inspector says: 1 herewith aqbmlt to you my sixth an nual report of work d<-lie from December I, 1909, to December 1. 1910 Daring tht* time i have made 103 special inspections, adjusted 26 l oaces and Wfitten 47 application*! Of these risks about two thirds were new work. 1 would call the Company’s attention to the importance ot taking some step* to make it a misderornnor to smoke li or around a barn. During the present year we have had one such I >ss, withoui question, and 1 presume none of us doubt that most of the barn fires cevur in this way. I also wish to impress on the Director* md Agents the importance of inspecting new Hues and chimnevs while being built wherever possible. We have no building laws In the counties and the result Is. that workmen are very lax and careless in a great many wavs, and a multitude of cracks and crevices are covered up, foi the time being, with a coat ol mot tat ami paint. In time thin drops oil leav mg woodwork exposed ami we have n mysterious fire. We have hud a recent exposure of just such work I ere in town, which limh given your Inspector consider able disagreeable work to do. A carciul inspection of our losses for the >ear will show that they have been greatly increased h> losing large risk* and not by more fires—a warning, ‘nor to put ho many eggs in one basket," and duly observed Uf all stock companies. I thank the Officers of the Company for their assistance and courtesy. Respectfully submitted. J. L. McCormick. Inspector. The Chairman was directed to appoint a committee of three to examine into the condition of the Company, and to report thiir tiridings to the stockholders’ meet ing, to Ik held January 2, for the annual election of diiectors, and also to make such recommendations for changes in the Company's by-laws us they deem wise.

Many hiisincs men make u failure as do farmers. Mr. B says farmers don't stick to aether ns they should and favors a Fro lics Exchange. Mr C. The great tremble with them Is the nerd of capital. Many start with little money and in a short time find themselves handicapped while the it et chant seldom goes Into hiisincis with it lack of capital. Mr. I).
