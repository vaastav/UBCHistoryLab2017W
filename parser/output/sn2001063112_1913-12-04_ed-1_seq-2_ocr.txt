A number of citizens have request ed ,Tlie Republican to enlighten them as to what the majority and minority iqass meetings should do, who should :attend, how the meeting should be cohducted) how their procedure cftn be safeguarded, etc. V£he Republi can is willing to undertake many a '"dlftlcult task, but it intist politely de- Cllhe to attempt to guide the voters through the maizes required by the Richards primary system, and more particularly through these mass meet ings, As the law 'virtually makes them free-for-all .affairs. The Republican has too candidates for-honors at the hand of these mass meetings. The contest in tho major ity republican meeting apparently will center on the selection of a •state committeeman, Lewis Shuet.er and'Ray Branson are candidates. As between them the voters of the county must choose. Both by allow ing the use ot their names are to be classified as supporters of Byrne and Crawford* and The. Republican has been unable to find in the Richards primary any kihd of test to npply to such professions. They can only be accepted'as sincere. Mr. Sh'uster lias been consistent progressive republi can for many years and while his op ponent has taken little part in poli tics, his father was one of the origin al -progressive republicans in the •county and in this campaign has been one of the most pronounced support er* of Senator Crawford. Either will be a candidate representative of the party and the contest between them .roust necessarily be largely a person al one. If either pt them is not in good faith a member of the majority fac tion, his name should not be consld ©red. Their own Statements must be accepted aa to that, because there can t« no appeal from them. At all events, lit is hoped and be lieved that the utmost fairness tnd orderliness wlU pervade the meet ing and the contest. By such a spirit the deficiency of the law in not defin ing a method of procedure will be supplied. Any other course must prove damaging to either side in the remainder c.f the) campaign and it certainly la right that each side should say, as has been said, that no old-tlnifr caucus methods will be tolerated. ^WILSON'S MESSAGE. S lent Wilson continues his writlng pioaBages in tab­ loid form. Today he read to con­ gress his first, general message and It was the briefest of its kind in Many years.^Consequently the pub­ lic will know a great deal more about what he lias said than it has In the past about tin contents of presidential messages. As a rule they have been so intermlnablyy long that very many have not even attempted to wade int them. President Wilson's message today Is notable chieliy in two particulars. First, and by far the most, important of his recommendations is .one de­ claring the necessity of legislation to provide for primary elections for the selection of national party candi­ dates. Hi' advocates iln• use of tlu convention solely for the purpose of formulating platforms and ratifying the work of the primaries. Under that plan delegates would lie chosen to national conventions by the direct, vote of tlio people. There would be no opportunities for contests, or for Jobbery in tho handling of delegates. The primary elections would settle all question as to what, candidate would receive the support, of any dis trict or state. This certainly is as it should be, and if the national party organizations had been alive to their own interests, they would have made their own provisions for such primary elections. It. is rather ironi­ cal that a democratic president should be recommending a euro for the very evil that all but wrecked the republican party in the last cam paign. The other noteworthy feature of Wilson's message in Ills declaration for tho conservation of resources by tlio national government. Against this democrats in congress and out have thundered ll\eir protests on be half of that ancient and sacred tra­ dition of states' rights. President Wilson shows how much regard lie has for this doctrine by dismissing the question in a single sentence. He declares there should be no conflict between state and federal authori­ ties in carrying out a policy of con- I servatlon, for the reason that there should bo IIO difference In purpose Here the president, lias put his fin ger on the sore spot that is caus­ ing all the clamor for states' rights. Wilson says there should be no diffi­ culty between states and nation be cause both- should be actuated by the same purpose. But the fact is that those who are lighting for con­ servation by state authorities, are not actuated by the same purpose is are those who have cham­ pioned national conservation. In nearly every case, they have attempt­ ed to make out of states' rights a shield behind which to carry on ex- oxploltation of the country's re sources. Wilson, has virtually chal lenged tliem by raising the question of purpose. Thus onco again does he demonstrate that ho Is indeed a disciple of the "new nationalism" preached BO earnestly by President Rooseevlt. —o UP. llobsou's Ointment Heals Itchy Itemii.

She appealed to them ear nestly to do their part in the vast civic, economic and domestic prob lems that are confronting this coun try and which must lie solved. She said In part: "The foundation rocks on which we should build our super structure are love, courage, charity, prudence, and truth. If we have these fundamental virtues well inbedded in our foundation, our building will not crumble. The influence of women's clubs is being felt in every walk of life. Men'of large affairs of slate and nation are beginning to realize that the women's clubs of the United Stat es wield a powerful influence for good and that their backing and re commendation of any cause will help to bring it to a successful Issue. A large per cent of the moral intellec- 1 lual and civic advance In the com munity Is due to the influence of the woman's club. Women have learned lo think clearly, differ amicably, and act wisely. For the most part, club women are progressive. Our debt to the National Endowment Fund is now liquidated and we are now starting out with our State Endowment fund, with a nucleus of seventy dollars.
