It is reported that it is about 0i to be made a party measure. $6 When the Glass bill passed the {J} bouse it looked as if such a consum- m&tion might easily be averted. That measure was debated with but little partisan rancor and the division up on its passage showed 24 republicans and 14 progressives voting with the democrats. This was as it should be, since the currency question had not been a party issue and the necessity lor intelligent revision of our present laws has been insistently dwelt upon "by republicans for years. In the senate banking and curren cy committee, however, the measure Ji® Trent aground. It is not necessary to i'i Tepeat the story of the division of that body, the coquetting on the part of democrats with the central-bank BCheme of a Wall street banker., the /'j feints and futilities. It is with the present that we are concerned. The S •. committee has become two oommit $: tees and each has prepared a bill. It it important to note their points of I" agreement and their points of differ eace, both from one another and y, from the house bill. S- Both ends of the committee unite upon the following features: •A system of regional reserve banks, federal control by a Federal Re serve Board, appointed by the presi dent. 3 The fixing of a discount rate by the several regional banks. The issue by the regional banks subject to the control of the Federal Reserve Board, of currency founded on prime commercial paper, redeem able in gold by the United States, and the maintenance of a special gold reserve for redemption. The refunding of the 2 per cent bonds now held to secure national bank circulation, into 3 per cent obli gations. The authorization of loans on farm lands by national banks. The reduction of the reserve re quirements of the present national banking law. The admission of state banks and trust companies into the new system. The two bills differ from each oth and frojn the original bill in the Allowing important particulars! In the number of the regional banks. The original bill provided for 12 the republican senate draft pro vides for 4, with a future maximum ~©i 8 the democratic draft provides for 8. It is evident that the republi cans in the senate committee have gone as far toward a single central ink as they dared. The amount of stock in the reserve bank allotted to the member bank. The original bill provided that the member bank should take stock to the amount of 10 pt?r cent of its own capital and should hold itself ready W'f: to take a like amount in addition M':h both the senate bills make the amount 6 per cent instead of 20. Each provides for sale of stock car rying no voting power to the public, if necessary to secure sufficient capi tal. The management of the regional banks. This is a point of vital im- IfeFv portance. The Glass bill, and the democratic senate draft, vests the management of each regional bank in nine directors, of whom the mem ber banks select two-thirds. The senate republican draft contemplates nine directors, of whom the Federal Reserve Board shall appoint five. This would make the Federal Re serve Board really only branches of a central bank, Washington having full control. It is the central bank under another name. There are other differences which tye reserve for future discussion. Those concerning reserves are of much practical importance. But these are the things which most deeply concern us all. The issue is squarely drawn be tween the two bills presented by the iiWi- two sections of the senate committee. Shall we have four regional banks |ip with directorates named, as to a ma jority of their members, from Wash %&l<, ington, and constituting practically a single central bank or shall we have -eight regional banks, each with two thirds of its directorate named by I'.fc.members banks, constituting each a self-governing institution, except for that supervisory control necessary to prevent such private control of bank .I?,., ing power as Messrs. Baker and Rey nolds have told us now exists? £$#"' This is a question worth dividing ''1^4 on. It really involves the deepest & difference between the republican and democratic parties. The party is Hi.ready to go to battle upon it if that 1? a ('M course proves necessary.—Republic. 

THEORY VERSUS FACTS. It has been a truism of the high tariff school for half a century, as sarcastically expressed by the late James G. Blain, that low tariffs invar iably and inevitably result in a "bounteous flow" of gold out of the country and of pauper labor goods into the country. The first month of the new low tariff shows gold flow ing "bounteously" in and not out. It shows pauper labor goods flowing in less "bounteously" even less than a year ago under the high tariff. It shows American merchandise flowing out to an unprecedented extent for the season. It shows a trade balance in our favor the greatest ever known. Who now are the theorists and the. impractical doctrinaires of this old problem? The4 record volume of exports in ifetober hardly jibes with prophecies of a decline of American foreign er. trade because of tariff readjustments. '•& Apparently American manufacturers :-.»re still able to Hold their own *ith '^*etitora, if o^\ ?.\ A $(' 1 AN ATTACK ON WILSON. There is no surer way of taking the size of a public man than by scrutinizing the methods of those who attack him. This test may be interestingly applied to President Wilson, in view 9f a malicious edi torial in the Chicago Tribune, a day or two since. The Tribune is the head and front, journalistically, of the western wing of the progressives. The progressives are supposed to stand, heart and soul for the reforms championed by the national democracy and to be at vari ance with the dominant party chiefly on questions of ways and means. In so far as they are sincere in their characterizations of stand-pat repub licanism a moral responsibility rests upon them to give approval—if not support—to the party which reform ed the rules of the House of Repre sentatives, revised the tariff and is now in a fair way to reform the cur rency. However the progressives may differ with democrats in theories of the relation of the central govern ment to the individual, there can be no doubt as to where they should turn when halting between support of the standpatters and the support of democracy of the Wilson type. Hence the following utterance from our Chicago contemporary is of deep interest: "That the triumphant march of the Wilson administration is not to con tinue without serious opposition is becoming more and more evident. "A newly elected executive always has matters his own way for a cer tain period after his election, but Woodrow Wilson has been more for tunate than most of his predecessors. "The vital division of the old re publican party has prevented serious partisan opposition, while the disor ganization of the democratic party has left the president almost su preme. In forcing through the tariff bill, President Wilson clearly strengthen ed himself with the people and at the same time dispersed his opponents. Whatever the merits of the pro posed currency legislation, it has brought him no political strength. On the contrary it has aroused wide spread opposition. It has also fur nished a meeting ground for indi viduals and interests opposed to him for other reasons. Mr. Hearst also has raised, the banner of revolt, and affords aid and comfort to all democratic insurgents. The murmurs of opposition in the democratic party are growing loud er and clearer. Congressmen and senators will not continue to sacri fice individual ambitions for a party harmony of which Mr. Wilson ap pears to them to be the sole bene factor. Indeed, the harmony of his cabinet is open to serious question, and there is more than a breath of suspicion that some of its members' are making overtures to his enemies. Whether President Wilson can be checked and destroyed by these gath ering clans, or whether he can dash them aside and continue from success to success, only time will tell. "His greatest strength is in the sep aration of "his enemies, but by the same token that his enemies in the democratic party are combining, he cannot be sure that his political op ponents will continue to neutralize each other. "One thing, and only one thing, is certain. His days of easy triumph are past. His future is beset with troubles, and if he is to succeed in the end, it will be by the develop ment of qualities upon which he has not hitherto had to call." The first thing that strikes a demo cratic eye in scrutiny of this attack is its utter futility. It adduces no im portant facts, makes no definite charges, begins anywhere and gets nowhere. The Tribune writes as the Wolfville parson preached. "He talk ed an' he talked, but he didn't p'int out he argyfied an' he argyfied, but he didn't show wherein." The near est thing to a definite specification furnished in the whole article is the reference to Mr. Hearst. In view of the number of times Mr. Hearst has "revolted" from the democratic party and the equal number of times he has like the hero celebrated in song and story, "come marching home,' this is a little less than comic. The general charges contained in the article are weak and silly. We are told that the president "appears to be the sole benefactor" of demo cratic harmony. We take it that our agitated contemporary means "bene ficiary." Either way, the allegation is simply silly. The statement that a harmony which has resulted from the exact and literal fulfillment of pre election promises could by any twist of circumstances, benefit the presi dent and nobody else could only be believed by people who were by chance so constituted as to consume just that particular brand of fiction. It strains the credulty of the person of average intelligence past the "elastic limit." We are told that there is "more than a breath of suspicion" that cer tain members of the president's cabi nett "are making overtures to his enemies. The Republic challenges the Tribune to give the facts that lie behind this astounding allegation. They will be news in democratic circles, and ought not, in the interest of truth, to be suppressed. "His greatest strength," we learn, "is in the separation of his enemies." Like Josh Billings, we "would ruther kno less than to know so mutch that an't so." Woodrow Wilson's great est strength is in his unflinching de votion to duty as he sees it and his clear grasp of the fundamental prin ciples of popular government. He is not diplomatic in the Machiavellian sense. He sometimes makes mis takes. But he has the entire confi dence of his party and the warm gratitude of the great mass of the American people. They may differ with some of his ideas they cannot refuse to recognize his sincerity and his forthright earnestness. Wilson has had no "days of easy success." We agree with the Tri bune that "his future.' is beset with troubles." "So has his,past been,,and the Republic knows that "he will con tinue to meet them with the fjrxn faith and strong will that have given him success" thus far^ It is a fine tribute to the pAyident that a paper with the Tri$aa sources, moved by the Tribune's malice, can find nothing to allege against President Wilson except that he has lost his rabbit foot and that strange things happen in the dark of the moon.—St. Louis Republic. 

GAMBLERS IN FOOD. Nearly one hundred United States district attorneys have been instruct- The cold storage combine is some thing more than an allegation. It is the biggest gamble of the day. It is the "sure thing" bet that speculators make against the vital needs of the people. Forestalling or engrossing, as the operations of the cold storage people would have them described several centuries ago, was a crime. Men who held back the people's food sup ply for gain were criminals and were punished as such. In every part of the United States where the common law prevails it is still a crime. In many states where statutory law has displaced the common law it is even more specifically a crime. The cold storage inventions are not public blessings. They are pub lic afflictions. They preserve food but they increase prices. When food is abundant and should be cheap, they corner it. When the markets are bare, they supply the demand sparingly at exorbitant rates. Yet there is no monopolistic enter prise in this trust ridden land more easy of regulation than storage and all the processes of storage. There is not a state or a county that cannot defeat the whole conspiracy. Laws as old as civilization run against it. There is not an honest court in Christendom that will not, on appli cation, enforce them. Why investigate an outrage that afHicts every home and blights every table? These gamblers in food are more notorious than those who risk money at cards or on horses. It is action that th^y fear not investiga tion.—New York World. SUCCESS OR DEFEAT. The democrats of Iowa may choose. Defeat or success depends upon their own action alone. If the democrats will get out to the primaries and nominate capable men whose democ racy is unquestioned, victory will crown their efforts, but if the demo crats are unconcerned and refuse to take the proper interest either in the platform or candidates, then it will be the same old story—defeat—and perhaps dishonor. Democracy is understood to be fair ness, straightforwardness, honesty, taking the people into your confi dence, and democracy is opposed to fraud and trickery, to deception and double dealing. Democracy, if de mocracy means anything, is fair play and open straightforward conduct. There are evidences abroad tend ing to show that it is intended to trick the democrats into doing things which they might not do in the full light of day. It was Abraham Lincoln who said, "You can fool- the people for awhile, but not always." It is a cardinal principle of the democratic faith that the interest of the whole people is of greater con cern than is the interest of any one man, or set of men. The people of Iowa and the people of every con gressional district in Iowa, are mani festly more concerned in the affairs of government than the man or co teries of men who desire and will seek nomination to office, and it should be impressed upon the mind of every candidate for every office, that the people will not be humbug ged or tricked into doing something that otherwise they would not do.— National Democrat. The Christmas Stocking Number. The "Christmas Stocking Number" of St. Nicholas is the appropriate name chosen for the December issue of the "best loved of all magazines." The Christmas spirit pervades nearly every page in the Nature and Science Department, to which the United States consul at Patras, Greece, con tributes an illustrated article on "Where Plum Puddings Grow." The illustrations of the number are many and include two paintings reproduced in full colors by Arthur Rackham. Parke H. Davis, Princeton member of the football rules committee, writes on "The Field-Goal Art." Annie'Fel lows Johnston, author of the "Little Colonel Books," has a continued story, "Miss Santa of the Pullman," illustrated by Reginald Birch. "Larry Goes on the Ant" is a father and son story that has something of the vigor of "A Message to Garcia." A calendar showing the "red letter days" when St. Nicholas arrives each month ac companies this number. The contri butions of members of the St. Nicho las League continue to be of extra ordinary interest to those who care for children. For example, one four teen year old girl, Emily Legg, sends in the following: A CHRISTMAS HYMN. Gleam, Christmas candle, gleam! Spread thy soft radiance far. And let its pure light beam As holy as the star That led the wise men far away, To where the gentle Christ-child lay. Fade, Christmas candlc, fade Now dimmer grows thy light.

Of the currency bill Senator Owen, chairman of the committee which framed it in the senate, declares it is "the most important measure that has been presented to the country since the civil war." Senator Owen in arguing for the passage of the bill in the senator pointed out some de fects of the present American bank ing system and gave some *f the remedies provided in the bill. He said: "The principal defect of our sys tem has been that the country has had no adequate protection against panics, so that from time to time the country has been shaken to its foun dations by the severest financial pan ics, throwing into chaos our com merce, our manufactures and our in dustries, from which the recovery in some cases has taken as much as four or five years. This bill was intended to correct the chief defects in our system." Senator Owen showed how during the 1907 panic interest rates fluctuated from 2 to 45 per cent so that money commanded as high at 25 per cent interest. This brought tremendous changes in the selling prices of stocks. He added: "The beneficiaries of this panic were those who could command cash and who had prepared themselves for the cataclysm that engulfed every body but themselves." To show the fallacy of charges that the present currency legislation had been prosecuted with undue haste Senator Owen recited how the currency had been continually before congress since 1907. The five years' debate of the subject was followed last year by the Pujo money trust investigation, the report of which covers several thousand printed pages, and which Mr. Owen said, showed that a fraction over 100 men exercised dominating control over property amounting to 122,000,000, 000, or practically a third of the na tional wealth excluding the land of the country. "The Pujo examination," declared Mr. Owen, "showed that these men could carry stringencies of credit to a point of absolute and overwhelm ing panic that could close the doors of all the banks of the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific in a single day. "1 shall not pretend to believe for one moment that the panic of 1907 was an accident, I profoundly believe that the result in October 1907, was a part of a concerted plan by which a few men enriched themselves at the expense of the nation, and admin istered what they conceived to be a terrifying political rebuke to the ad ministration then in power (Roose velt's). I have always contended that a drastic congressional investigation of this panic should have been made and its promoters and beneficiaries exposed to full view." Then, Senator Owen said, Chair mas Glass of the house banking and currency committee, began the con sideration of the question with a view of framing a bill to afford ade quate remedy to this country against the exercise of individual unrestrain ed and irresponsible power over the business men of this country. This committee's report, after hearing rep resentatives of the great commercial houses and financial experts, was printed in a volume of over 700 pages. "I refer to these investiga tions because it has been given out that congress was rushing through this measure," Senator Owen said, whereas _the subject had been under consideration since 1907. He added that the bill was debated extensively in the house and has been before the senate since September 18, during which time the senate committee had taken testimony covering 3,200 pages of printed matter. The purposes of the measure he outlined as follows: First—To insure the stability of our commerce, of our manufacturing enterprises, of our industries, and the safety of our merchants and manu facturers and business men general ly. Second—To make available effec tive commercial credit for individuals engaged in manufacture, in com merce, in finance, and in business to the extent of their just deserts. Third—To put an end to the pyra miding of the bank reserves of the country and the use of such reserves for gambling purposes on the stock exchange. Fourth—To keep constantly em ployed the productive energies of the nation. And this consideration is of vital importance to the laboring men of the country, who are dependent for their daily bread upon constant, regular employment. Our crimes, our vices, our chief social evils come from lack of regular remunerative employment. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington, Dec. 1.—Special Cor respondence.—With both houses of congress again in regular session and down to business, after hearing President Wilson's inspiring message of Tuesday, the most important legis lative session in the last two decades is in progress. The senate has adopt- ... ed as its slogan "a currency law be- pepper's place of leadership in the Senator Owen declared that this measure will cure the condition that compelled men in times of panic to "go trembling, with hat in band, seeking credit to which they are en titled and which they ought to have merely for the asking upon the class of securities which they can offer." He also said one of the most far reaching results of the bill will be the abatement of the nuisance, the national menace of stock gambling operation in this country, because this measure proposes to gradually withdraw the reserves which hereto fore have been pyramided in the three great reserve cities for stock gambling purposes.
