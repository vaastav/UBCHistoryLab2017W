President Harding in his message to Congress last week dealt with the subject to some length. He says that if the statutory provisions for pro hibition enforcement are contrary to rlp1ihprtf rmblic omnion. which he HW X A- does not believe, the rigorous and lit eral enforcement will concentrate public attention on any requisite mod ification. ' j "Such a course." he adds, "con forms with the law and saves the hum iliation of the crovernment and the humiliation of our people before the world and challenges the destruc tive forces engaged in widespread violation, official corruption and indi vidual demoralization." The Burlington Free Press is con ducting a vigorous campaign against the laxness of matters on the west side of the staae. It calls upon the judges to give jail sentences instead of nominal fines where convictions are made. The Free Press says: "Wi-tis $500 bail for a man wno is fy running rum trom L,ana-j irmont and tnence to otner s a nne oi yaw anu cusw m-runner or a Dooxiegger, nown to be a notorious and violator of the law? th of these instances the imposed are eauiyalent to a le, a mere invitation to vio- the law to continue in evu ity of the evil resulting rf -J! -4.1 11,. posing ox practicanv ences in . the case oi nd bootleggers, is also glance at the maximum 

PRESS CLIPPINGS Three Recent Jail Breaks. 7 (Hardwick Gazette) Jail breaks have come in rotation, commencing at Newport, and follow ing down to Washington county, dur- iner the cast summer and tall. At Newport. Robarge, the Chinese smug gler, got away, and the Gazette does not have the information that he has been re-captured. Next, Mills, another smuggler and hold-up man, escaped from Caledonia county nail at bt. Johnsbury, and the other day, Mady, a third smuggler, walked out of Washington county jail at Montpelier. All these breaks have cost the state considerable expense for re-capture and trying to re-capture the prisoners. Except in the first case, when the jail bars were sawed, the ' escapes have not been strenuous in effort, and the public begins to wonder about the ap parent ease of the get-aways. It is evident that these prisoners are looking for every possible oppor tunity of getting away, and from the very risks of their nefarious profes sion, they get accustomed to take big chances and are therefore subjects for special watch by the jail authorities. (Brattleboro Phoenix) The Windham county jail of Con necticut has its leaks like the Wind ham county jail of Vermont. A pri soner in the former institution who escaped early in November was cap tured last Friday in Winooski, Vt., and once more placed behind the bars. In less than five minutes he was again enjoying his freedom. He hadn't . forgotten the combination. ed" because, in the natural condition of things as they exist, their schools and equipment can never be brought up to a standard without rebuilding. This, however, is: nothing against them; they lose nothing. They, are merely not in line for a little additional-state aid, awarded to districts which are more diligent or more for tunate in having built better in the past. The Herald believes that the policy of the state board is to bring respon sibility back to the towns, and it is a good plan; The sooner local tax pavers and their school commission ers see' the school problem as a local problem, the sooner will they get lm provement. ' This does not interfere with a gen eral plan of state aid for schools makes it more effective and general, as a matter of fact but it does point to the indubitable axiom that no town can rise much hieher than its pres ent school level without a little school initiative of its own. . Before we begin condemning the state board, let us look, over our own buildings, equipment and teacher-sal aries. There may be a good many things we can do on our own account, 1 r V xn r J I J set out, and every year new trees come into bearincr. The work of building up such an orchard has been an arduous task. The credit for producing such a magnificant orchard and keeping it in such a fine condi tion mustvbe given to the superinten dent, Mr. Albyn, and his manager, Mr. Ryan. It is these two men who made 'The Orchards' what theyare todays nt prohibitory law pass- gislature in 1921 contains n: 6558 of the General Laws !v amended so as to read as "A person whojnanufactures, .sells, barters, transports, imports, exports, delivers, prescribes, possesses or fur nishes any intoxicating liquor, except as authorized in this chapter, or pos sesses a still or other apparatus for the the manufacture of intoxicating liquor, or who exposes or keeps with intent to furnish or sell intoxicating liquors, shall be imprisoned not more than twelve months nor less than three months, or fined not more than one thousand dollars, nor less than three hundred dollars, or both." Our judges have sworn not only to uphold 'the constitution of the United States and Vermont but also faith fully to perform their duties. We submit that carrying out the spirit of Vermont's laws is especially incum bent upon Vermont justices of the peace, our municipal courts and every other judicial officer. This paper has before commended the position of Orleans County's municipal judge in putting convicted bootleggers for commercial purposes and persons convicted of driving a ear while intoxicated, behind the bars. In this stand Judge Wright has led the courts of the state, and his po sition is now being demanded in oth er localities, as witnessed by the call of the Burlington contemporary. It is even said that Judge Wright's ear ly and firm stand in this particular has driven many smugglers to other routes and a firm stand by ' every court in this matter would have some tendency to stem the tide of smug gling. Law must, be enforced else we reach a condition like that in Russia. Law is law, whether we like that law or not and the individual who stands for its violation is more or less a criminal or a "red." It is quite apparent that the ques tion of the enforcement of the Vol stead act has" come to a crisis and that the law will either be modified or much better enforced within the next year. Let those who believe in the 18th amendment and its strict enforcement stand toeether ' in the next months as they have never ral lied before. It is a time and a place for red blooded men and women to take a position for or against. We cannot be neutral. It is our country, our. law, our business. Law enforcement is a most vital is sue at this very moment. Bates Vs. Bryant. (Stanstead,, P. Q., Journal) The senior member of the state highway commission, Dr. W. N. Bry ant of Springfield, has entered the political arena to prove that the re signed member of the board, S. B. Bates of Derby, has been playing fast and loose with the cause of, or his (Bates') reasons for, his leaving the board. Dr. Bryant accuses Bates ; of using the press to misstate the facts and Bates' purpose in this was to discredit the board and the high way department. Now the facts of t.he last meeting of the Hartness, Bry ant, Bates highway commission are simply that Mr. Dix, an employee of the commission, presented a report for publication, that carried things that Mr. Bates could not subscribe , to, and' he voted no upon Dr. Bryant's motion that it be accepted in total for publication, and asked permission to file a minority report, which was refused by the governor under one of his explosions of temper which have been more or less frequent, when op posed, throughout his administration. In the record of this meetinsr. the no j-- i i. j i. t I vute auu mqucsi uu iiuu appeal. xjl. Bryant later wrote Mr. Bates that he could present his minority report to the board, and that itus unusual and irregular. The report has never been given to the board because it was, of course, evident that it would be thrown out by the two to one vote of the commission, while it deserved to be treated with the same courtesy as a dissenting or minority opinion of one or more U. S. Supreme m court judges on . a decision. This is a very common practice, and is not made oc casion for ciuarreling by the bench, and drastic comment by the press. The whole thing in regrettable, but as far as can be ascertained Mr. Bates has refrained from commenting about the affair, and Dr. Bryant's attempt to draw him into a controversy has not availed. The doctor's explana tions are not at all sound or convincing. The Editor's Chair. (Exchange) A lawver charges a man $10 for ten minutes' conversation the man insists on paying it. A doctor charges $1 for a prescription and the patient "Oh nshaw. it that enough?" An undertaker conducts a funeral and charges $100 and he is just perfect ly lovely with everybody inside and outside the family. A man Duys a gold brick and apologizes for not hav ing bitten sooner. An editor walks a mile in the hot sun to get the facts of a sudden death or wedding or so sial function and spends three hours in writing it up and tells lies and praises people till he hates himself. Then if he makes an insignificant omission or error or charges five cents straight for three extra papers he is a stingy cuss who never gets anything right and charges four times the price ot city papers twice as large. In short he js a confounded most-any-old-thing and ought to be run out of town. Talk about the ice man! How would you like to run a newspaper? if-? of mtv Therearenomlraclesmcook ing.

Substantial increases in Trust Com pany resources both for the state and the country are shown by "Trust Companies of the United States," the annual publication of tJi TTnifo States Mortgage & Trust Company of New York, just issued for 1922. The figures are of exceptional interest in that 1922 marks the 100th year of trust company service in the United States. The total resources fo the year ending June 30th, were $12,739,620, 733 against $12,323,430,513 last year, ana aggregate deposits for the first time exceeded $10,000,000,000. , Vermont reported of $67,005,384 for a gain of over 

VERMONT HAS LARGEST ORCHARD Bennington Orchard Has 75,000 Trees Covering 3600 Acres. Getting Our Deserts. (Bennington Banner) A near riot in the city of Burling ton a few days ago in which the po lice, citizens and students of the Uni versity of Vermont were involved has aroused the attention of the peo Burlington to the fact that laws are not being enforced there. The police seem to be slack, the city officials dodge their responsibility and pass the buck to the prosecuting officers, who apparently mostly fail. The re sult is a bad mess and one that is growing worse. Burlington, however, has no mon opoly on this sort of thing. appears to be as bad and Bennington about the same. Here in Bennington a meeting of fifty or so citizens was held a few evenings ago to consider the question of limiting some of the more open and notorious evils of local law breaking. The tendency of the men at the re cent meeting of the citizens generally is to blame the police and the prose cuting officers. The police who have The production of maple sugar is one of Vermont's foremost indu9ries' Vermont maple sugar is universally known. Its demands are enormous. Yet there is an industry that will sur pass if it has not already outdistanc ed, the maple sugar industry in im portance. That industry is the pro duction of apples. The largest orchard in Vermont, or for that matter, the largest private owned orchard in the world, is locat ed at Bennington in the extreme southwest corner of Vermont. The orchard contains 75,000 trees, or more; 55,000 of these are apples trees, and the remainder are plum, pear, quince and cherry trees. The total acreage occupied by these trees is 3,600 acres The orchard is divided into two main divisionsr the Benning ton division and the Carpenter Hill division. The orchards are given careful at tention. A man, well versed in the knowledge of apple culture, is kept busy going about the orchard to see that the trees are in good condition. As soon as any disease is discovered in the orchard, it is immediately re ported to the office and men sent out to check it. In the spring the trees are intensively sprayed. It is an interesting sight to see the orchard during picking time. The heavy laden trees, the busy men, the piles of picked fruit, the weighting of horses and the creaking of the waeons n!!all combine to produce an interesting pie OI cna-na The orchard is divided into blocks. There may be a block of four or five hundred Baldwin trees in one place, and next to it a block of Greenings. Roads wind in and out of the orchard. When picking time comes, the picking gang go. onto one block and finish that block before starting another. All of Rutland ,the fruit is picked by hand, no auto- raauc jucKers oemg usea. Suppose we consider what a typical picking and packing scene looks like. It is plum time. For weeks the plums have been ripening In the hot after noon sun. - And now they are ready to be picked, packed and shipped. The procession that we see leaving the packing house for the plum lots is rather a strange one. Men are carry ing picking baskets, bushel baskets, ladders and hammer and nails.

As the Banner has before said every town and every state get pre cisely as good government as they de serve. Bennington and Burlington are getting precisely what they are supporting. They can . have better any time they choose to insist. The Farm Bureau Federation of Vermont has selected two of its of ficers from Orleans county in O. M. Rowell of Albany as vice president, and Mrs. J. II. Bartlett of Orleans on important committee. .Orleans an county may feel proud of this distinc tion and the Farm Bureau Federation of the state has chosen well. Blind Buyers. , Who gets the most for his money? The man who buys blindly or the fellow who reads advertising and-" discovers the really wants and l things . needs ? he Educational. Problems Get Back to the Towns. (Rutland Herald) Among the problems which the legislature-elect for action, none is of more importance than education. A senator-elect, identified all his life with road buldng, made the statement the other day than schools are more essential than roads. He is right. There is apt to be a . flurry on the surface against the state board of ed ucation and its policies, and the Her ald desires to go on record as believ ing that the members of that board and Commissioner Dempsey have con baskets, which 'are placed in crates fTl fc 1 i j. nere are o& DasKets or quarts m a crate. When the crate is full the cov er is nailed on and the crate set in the shade. The crates are carried from the plum lot to the storage barn m a spring wagon. In packing, caro is taken to see that no inferior plums are packed with the good fruit. - If some of the fruit is not as firm as the rest, it is placed in a crate by it self and properly labeled. The plums are shipped to New York, .Boston, Spnngheld and other cities face Last year "The Orchards" shipped three carloads of plums besides sell ing a hugs quantity in Bennineton. North Adams, Mass., and Pittsfield, Mass. When a car is to be shipped, it is nrsi icea so as to matce sure the fruit arrives .at its destination in a good condition. The plum crates in which the plums are packed are made at "The Or chards." On rainy days, when out of-door work is impossible, the men make the crates. The field boxes. ducted the school affairs of the state, -which are used for packing apples, are "isvium auu uiaticuun. aiso maae at ine urcnaras. it is probably true that there is a deal of so-called "overhead," The apples are picked and placed m the held boxes.

They with, and that is unless town schdol boards take over some of the work they are now passing over to the sup ervisors, there will be no practical way offered to reduce the number of supervision districts. In short, the towns must do more work for themselves or the state can not reduce its field force a great deal. are packed in boxes, similar to those used by western apple growers, and in barrels. Some apples are sold in bushel baskets, but the manager has found that apples packed in boxes stand up better than shipments in any other form. - Thus very briefly I have sketched some of the scenes that are enacted There has been some discussion of everv fall at "The Orchards " the standard ; rural school plan, and "Thp flrrliAHs." is stfarfiW inr-TPaB. some districts are pretty well "peev- ing in size.
