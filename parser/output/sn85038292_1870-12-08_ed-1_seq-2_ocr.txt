Advertising is lo business wlut.fpr- GUfiei? are to l!\c soil. It..is hard to make a good crop without them ; and it is a difficult mutter, iu these days, to conduct a thriving trade without adver tising. Wo know some, who are plod ding along in the old way, and won’t advertise, but they have up hill work ol it. Their shelves and counters are covered with dust, and they themselves look as it’ they bad reccutiy returned frotqjbe funeral of some friend, so wo begone is the visage they continually wear. Talk with them, and they will bore you about hard times, the dullness of trade, and the scarcity of money Look at the man who advertises. llis store is filled with customers, and he hasn’t got time to get tho blues, or to look melancholy. He don’t complain of hard times, like the plodding nouad vertiser, because his customers keep him busy. His countenance is bright and cheerful, he meets you with a smile and an air of business, which at once assures you that that is the place to spend your money. Besides, his prices are almost invariably lower than the prices of the man who don’t advertise; because ho is not dull and sluggish, like (he other, but keeps up with (be times, buys low, keeps his stock fresh, and is always ready to buy or sell a bargain. Isn’t this all true? Every one knows it is. Let the nonadvertisers alone—“to let’' will soon be chalked upon their doors, and they will have to turn their attention to other channels of business, or else retire from business altogether, which is more probable. Look to the columns of your county papers, if you want to find out where bargains are to be had. Increase of Government Salaries. The Washington Star adverts to this subject, and seems to think there will be a general increase of the salaries of the government employees, either at the present or some future session of Con gress. It collates the opinions of the Cabinet, and certain members of both Houses,among whom Senators Williams, Schui z, Pomeroy and Trumbull, ore re presented as favoring the scheme. It wys r —Senator Williams is pronounced in the opinion that “ everybody's Salary ought to be raised ” He proposes to give the President 8100,- 000 a year, Cabinet officers 825,000, Congressmen 810,000, and to increase the pay of other officials in the same, ratio, including all the jiJerks of the several dcpar.ments. How far the an nual expenses would be increased there by, wo are not prepared to state, but O.'rtainly they would bo swelled to a considerable amount. The time is not propitious for considering the subject. The public debt is so large, taxation is •o onerous, and the people so burdened with the public charge, that it would be oritel to add even one dime more, by way of increased salaries. Let the public burdens first be lightened by an economical administration of the Guv ernmenl, and a reduction of the public debt, before an increase of the salaries of all Government officials is attempted. Meeting of Congress.— The sec ond session of the Forty-first Congress commenced on Monday last, and will expire on (he 4th of March next, at which time tho Forty-second Congress Will meet, unless the law requiring it to ■met at that time is repealed. The President’s Message was deliv ered to Congress on tho first day of the session. It is variously received and commented upon, and is deemed a piece (A documentary patch work, the product of several pens. Butler gets credit for the portion of it relating to Canada, the tithories and the navigation of the St. Lvdrcoee. Our readers lose nothing because we have not space for it in onr columns. The message contains 9,085 words, and the actual time required for send ing it ; by telegraph to Baltimore, Phil acfelphia and New York, over ten wires, was 37i minutes, or 25 words per min ute. The , Baltimore American omits to efedift the Advocate for the articles which it takes from its columns. An obaeuro country paper, without suffi cicot resources in itself, might be ex cused for occasionally poaching upon neighbors ; but a respectable metro politan journal, like the American, one would think, would hardly do such Itdfgs; that whon finding an article iu aay of its country exchanges which it desired to transfer to its columns, its softie of justice and propriety would prompt it to give tho proper credit. Charge Gale, James Coliec and Lcwio f frr u — of Kent county, Maryland, ar rUfthl for pretended violations of the Halted Slates election law, were dis by Commissioner Rogers.— 1 These gentlemen committed no offence 1 against the laws. Their arrest was the ( result of psrty meHgnity alone, and the 1 Ytlhttfts who instigated it ought to be made examples of. I New England and the South. Wc have at length a complete state ment of the returns oi the United States census of (ho population of tho entire Southern States, and as great interest has been felt (o see the effect of the war upon that section, wo subjoin a compar ison showing what it was in 1860 and what it is now : State. 1870. iB6O.

Weal Virginia, 447,642 Aggregate, 13,947.822 12,230,678 Increaae, 1,717,749 Not a single slate of all this array ex hibits a decrease of population, notwith standing all of them have suffered from the ravages of a terrible war of four years duration and unpreealented mag nitado. That there must have been a diminution of the people at that time docs not admit of a doubt; but the five years of recuperation, peace and indus try, have given an unwonted impetus to immigration into the southern states from Europe and from the north. The population of New England, by the census of 1870, as contrasted with that of 1800, stands as follows : States. 1860- 1870. Maine, 628.27 S 630,42* New Harapshipe, 325.07 S 317.976 Vermont, 315,998 330.235 Massarlmsetta, 1,231,066 1,448.055 Rhode Island, 174.620 217,319 Connecticut, 460,147 537,998 Total, 3,135,283 3,482,001 While tho South has increased, 1,- 717,749, the New England S ates have increased only 310,718. This may readily bo accounted for. In the first place, u Ncw England is a good place to emigrate from,” as was said by one of her distinguished sons. Her bleak bills and barren rocks are not calculated to sustain a very dense population, because they arc not very productive. Her in habitants “live by thoir wits,” their wits being sharpened by their necessities. They arc shippers, manufacturers, traf fickers, inventors, stock jobbers, teach era, agency-seekers, patent speculators, peddlers; and with all their sharpness many can barely make out to live. The war broke up the labor system in the South, and the scarcity of labor has had a tendency to cheapen land, much of which has been thrown into market at a low figure, and New England vor. ciry has gobbled up as much of it as it was possible to get hold of, and all who could buy themselves a homo upon the Savan nahs of the South, have gone there lo better their fortunes. This accounts for these results of the census. Tho starve lings of New England have rushed to that much despised region, to make more sure their bread and butter. 14 Thooi*s Ordered to Georgia”— “Trooph for Florida.”—Do we live under a republican government, where the people bear rule, or arc wo governed by the Autocrat of Russia? Fire hun dred recruits are ordered to Atlanta, “to aid in the enforcement of the Con gressional election law, at the approach ing election in Georgia.” Troops have < been ordered to Tallahasse. “lo preserve order, on Tuesday, when the State board > of cauvossers is to announce the result j of the late election in Florida.” Such are the despotic decrees which issue from the Executive at Washington. 1 “ On wbat meat doth tKU oar Cueaxr feed, ' That he bath grows su great 7” I In 1826, John Qmncy Adam*, then 1 President of the United States, sent General Gaines to Georgia to manage certain political matters in that State, whereupon, according to the PUila icl- 1 phia Age, the Governor wrote to him that if Gaines attempted to interfere with the election mutters of that State, i he would send him lo Washington in , irons. He did not interfere. Now General Grant orders military men to interfere iu Slate elections, sod backs them with tho forces of the United States. If a Governor complains, be is threatened with irons and imprisonm nt Times have changed since 1824. Then the people were ina.-ters. Now, the President falls back upon bayonets and defies the people, but the people will send him into retirement stamped with ignominy. The Next Speaker.— The New York Post, an administration paper, but iu favor of s revenue reform, after care fully analysing tl e politics of the mem bers of the next Congress, says the “ revenue reformers will elect the next Speaker, and thereby control the organ ization of committees and regulate the legislation of Congress.” According to the Post, (he next House will contain 122 revenue reformers, 70 protection ists, and 45 doubtful votes, which will probably bo pretty evenly distributed, allowing about 140 votes as the strength of the reform party. The Kllicott City Times says:—lt is currently reported, upon good authority, that Mr. Gary is no party to the scheme for contesting Judge Merrick’s seat. — Wc were loth to believe that a gentle man of Mr. Gary’s high personal char acter could lend himself to tho perpe tration of such an unjustifiable piece of business, and we sincerely hope that tho report maybe true.” His “pretended friends” arc ssid to have inaugurated this proceeding) which will likely conic to nought. Tho New York canal commissioners have voted to clone the canals, Dec. 8. The Day-Dawn.—After a long, dreary night, to our unhappy, misgov erned and much abused country, the weary watchers begin to see tho fir I glinlings and glimmering* of (he rosy dawn, and joyously exclaim, since the lato elections—“ Behold I how brightly breaks tho morning !” To the South, especially, this promise and portent of tho political d y-priug is us pleasant as light to (he eyes, and *hou the day is fully como, it will be hailed there with the most joyous acclamation. The Charleston Courier has a lengthy editorial in its issue of tho 21st, on the “true interpretation of tho result” of the recent Democratic victories in the several Stales, from which we clip the closing paragraph,.as follows : The result oflhe recent elections certainly exhibit lo us that the long expected day is at last gilding with its rays the mountain tops. We can but express the hope that the re action which has taken place in the public sentiment of the country mar sweep on ami on, until wc shall, indeed, lire in the full blaze of a Government of freedom, and of ri.-ht, in truth, as well us in name, and which, administered on the principles on which it was established, will secure peace and prosperity to all. The World discourses of Oran Ur pros pects for the succession. The man himself has no popularity, and no polit ical attachments apart from those which come of political patronage. Moreover, many of his enemies mak* politic pro fessiuns of support, as they do not wish to impair their influence in the party, but (wc are told) they will intrigue against his nomination, and would easily succeed if they had a strong rival can didate to pit against him : Colfax is too light, Butler too ill balunced, Sumner too pedantic and con ceited, Trumbull has too little popular ity out of Illinois, Fenton is too much of a demagogue, and Boutwcll, who wears all the laurels of the administra tion, has too many jealous rivals in his own State, and is too weak to cope with rivals elsewhere. Grant may therefore get the nomination, but he will shatter and prostrate the party in doing so. A Washington dispatch says that the work of consolidating the internal revenue districts throughout the country bus thus far resulted in dispensing with over four hundred Assistant Assessors, and it is thought that nt least two hundred more will be dismissed by the close of the year. Let the good work goon. Could we have had our way, wc would have dis pensed with the internal revenue itself, and then we should have got rid of all the assessors. Not only so, but we , would have dismissed all the leeches < nod hangers on upon the Treasury, long j ago. And, better still, we hope to see I the Administration itself dismissed by * the people, in 1872, and a thorough revenue reform inaugurated, as well as 1 u thorough reform in the civil service. ,J and in every other service. Magazine Change —The December * number of the New Eclectic Magazine contains a variety of entertaining and 1: instructive articles. A change is an ’’ nounced in the proprietorship of the j ruagaxie, Mr. Lawrence Turnbull rctir- J ing, and Messrs. Fridge Murdock, Win. ’ Hand Browne aud Win. L. Hill being * proprietors and publishers. Mr Browne will continue the editorial duties, which , he has discharged with ability aud uc- i ceptance. The name will be chungd to The Southern Magazine, which will more fitly indicate its nature and ob jeets than the present title. Delaware—The next Legislature will have to choose a U. S. Senator to succeed Hon. Willard Saulsbury, whose term will expire on the 4th of March next. Among the gentlemen spoken of for the position arc Hon. John W. Houston, formerly a Member of Con gress, His Excellency, Gove Saulsbury. he present Governor of the State, and Eli Saulsbury, Esq , both brothers of the present incumbent, aud Hon. J. Glancy Jones, formerly a Member of Congress from Pennsylvania, Tho choice is most likely to fall, it is said, upon Guv. Saulsbury or Judge Houston. New Music.—We have received from the publisher, Mr. Charles H. Hai ley, dealer in Sheet Music, Music Books, and Musics! Instruments, 221 West Baltimore Street, In Memorinm , Gen. Robert E Lee, Funeral March; also, True to the Gray, words by Pearl Rivers, music by Paul Helen. The Population of Baltimore, os re ported by tho U. S. Marshal, was 267,* 599. This result was so unsatisfactory that it was determined to take the census over again, which was accordingly done by the Police Commissioners. They report the population at 283,375, an increase of 15,776. No effort was made, so far as wo know, to send delegates to the Immi gration Convention which meets in Hal (imorc on Tuesday next. Let any of our citizens who may be in the city at that time attend it. Trout Rahing.— We see it stated that the Silver Spring Dam, about three miles from Mcchanicsburg, Cumberland county, has been leased by a stock com pany, with a view of raising trout on uu extensive aeile. Suitable buildings are now being erected, and the neoes sary preparations made for the success ful propagation of this savory fish.— Compiler.

Parkton and Manchester Railroad. — An esteemed correspondent gives us the following in relation to the progress of this road : (ironn 1 wm Awl broken at Bocklcysviile, (midway between Park ton and Manchester.) on the 12th day of October, IM9, and the ('oniractors. Messrs. McOuckin, Shower k Co., commenced work October 15th, 1869. and since that time the work of construction has been going on steadily. The line of the Parkton and Manchester Railroad branches off from the Northern Central Railroad at Parkton, and follows a small stream colled Owl Creek, to its head, which is three miles from Parkton. The work of graduation is completed to this point, which is also the summit, dividing the waters of the big and little Gunpowder. The summit cut, near the village of Ray ville, is about one-third completed. This cut is about 88 feet deep and 1800 feel long, and one of the highest {mints between Park ton and Manchester. From the summit to the Gunpowder River, which is two miles, the work of gra duation is completed, except one cut and some trestle work crossing several deep ravines where earth could not easily be procured. The bridge across the Gunpow der will be seventy feet above the water, and of the Howe truss pattern ; the em bankments approaching the bridge are nearly completed, and the deep cuts on each side are half out. From the Gunpow der to Shamberger's Mill, the work is nearly completed, which is in distance one quarter of a mile. The work thus far has been heavy, and a lare proportion of it rook. From Mr. Shamberger’s Mill to Falken sliue’s Tannery, no work has ns yd been done, the distance being about ci Jit miles, and the work light, in comparison to the work already done. From the Tannery to Manchester, or rather to the College, the distance being a little over one mile, the work U completed, except trestle work crossing two ravines. The masonry from Parkton to the Gunpowder is completed, except the crossing of one stream, requiring u double box culvert and a sin -le box cul vert at another point, near Mr. Kelly’s, where the work has been suspended on ac count of the land damages not being settled. One month, however, will complete this whenever work is resumed again at that place. From the short lime that work has beau done on this line, a little more than one year, and never more than from fifty to sixty men at work, at least one third of the road is graded, and that, too. in a complete and substantial manner—the embankments being composed mostly of stone and gravel, and can settle but little. Should the Stockholders pay up promptly their instalments, and those in whose hands the road is left fur management be active, so that the Contractors are not kept down to a few dozen nun only, the entire line to Manchester cun be completed in one year from this time. The work at one time was going on bravely, and looked as though an early completion of the same wo Id bo had. for the contractors were operating finely, and meant to complete the work by next July, if they could but keep up their force, but were rather obliged to reduce than to it: crease it. Let those at the head of this enterprise J do their duly, and also all connected and I interested therein, and a speedy completion may be looked for. We learn that arrange I incuts are about being made, so that the road may be rapidly constructed, and a por tion of it in running order by July next. This road will open to suburban residents the most U-* liful and picturesque section of Baltimore and Carroll counties, and ut the same time the moat healthful and salt! brious. We would therefore say, success to the noble enterprise, and let there be no such word as fail. lly KUUhj —This is the season for killing hogs, nuking sausage, and ren dering lard. Many fine hogs are an nually grown in this city, uur citizens seeming to vie with each other as to who shall have the honor of producing the largest.

The Joint Stork Mannfartnriny Company. —We hope to see Central Hull crowded with our citizens to mor row evening. The two committees op pointed at the last meeting will make their reports on that occasion, and il is probable that a gent lent an from York. IV. who is familiar with each enter prises, will address the meeting, detail ing the beneficial results which have been expedience! from similar enter prises in York, Harrisburg, and other places. Let all our citizens who feel a i lively interest in the prosperity and ad vancement of Westminster be present. It is the productive industry of a place which gives it u stimulus and impor tanoe. Merchants, shopkeepers, tra ders, professional men, all contribute to the conveniences of society, but it is to the productive industries of a town or neighborhood, after all, that we must look fur substantial prosperity. Give us more producers, more manufacturing enterprises, and Westminster will gu ahead with increased momentum upon her oarecr of prosperity. Muu Killed in the Mountain* —Wm. Wills was shot dead by Martin Car baugh, in the South Mountain, (Frank lin township,) on Wednesday. The i only particulars we have are that Wills went to Carbuugh's house and commenc ed abusing him, and that Corbaugh , shot Will* through the abdomen with a pistol, causing his death in a few mo ments. Officer Rouzer has gone to ur test Carbaugli.— Gettythnry Compiler. An effort is being made hero, to have two mails, daily, between Westminster and Baltimore.

The company, it will be re numbered, claims, under a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, that the imp:witiun of the tax is con trary to the laws of the United Stales, but at the same time collects the tax and retains its proceeds; in other words pas sengers using the Washington Brunch, are still required by the Railroad com pany to pay the Slate tax. but the com puny at the same time withholds the money received from the State Treasury. The company claimed a set-off of $285,- 529, being for premiums upon gold and exchange to pay the interest in London : upon the bonds of the Stale. To this i pica of set off the Stale filed a demur rer, which was argued on Thursday and Friday of lust week. Judge Dobbin delivered his opinion on Monday sus • tuining the demurrer and overruling the plea of set off.
