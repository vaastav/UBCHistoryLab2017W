Thf ,Contmtiovs.?I learn this morning that the project of Mr. Butler to incorporate certain **conditions" in the bill to admit the State of Virginia into the "Union" will 1 >e strenuously opposed by many Radicals-. Tim grounds of their opposition, however, nfford additional proof of the rapid strides of congressional usurpation. Thevcontcnd that, without anvexpress reservation, Con ges. possesses the power to remand any of the reconstructed States hack to their terri - ? al condition, as they have in effect done with Georgia, and that to insert such re servation in the particular ease of Virginia would rather weaken than give strength to the Radical theory in its application to the r-st of the satrapies. The Radicals in the House nr^ much divided, therefore, in re-pert To Butler's proposition. Tt is possi ble that it may be strangled in the commit tee itself. It is impossible at this hour to predict the result. The vote will probably be taken to-morrow. The " Reconstruction Committee'' can report at anv time. It is privileged committee.

The extremists wish to apply the test-oath, which would be ruin ous to the interests of the State. The ultra faction will endeavor to defeat Morton's bill, and failing in that will try to have it post poned until after the holidays. Should Morton's hill pass, and the people of Geor gia accede to its term-, an effort will be made to bring the State promptly into the Union.

" It Is rumored that the Judiciary Com mittee are not satisfied with any of the newly-appointed circuit judges. To one or two of them the strongest opposition is made, and the confirmation of a majority is very doubtful.

Tt has already been announced that a di structivc fire occurred at Galveston, Texas on the 3d instant. It broke out in tb wholesale clothing establishment of Coh Brothers. The GalvestonXeics says: Spreading along the Strand) the devour ing element took in* its way Jalonick & Smith, dealers in sash, Minds,* etc.; Burns & Gee, hardware ; Alfred Ball, Jr., clothing:1 Megale, liquor dealer, who had a largo stc- k 011 hand : Craig & Huff, liquors ; ?> nch & Co., auctioneer* ; Shields k Co., agricultu ral implements: the fine building just erect ed by the Merchants Mutual Insurance Company, and occupied by numerous cot ton factors and commission merchants, and the Ruby saloon. On Tremont it first took M. W. Shaw k Co., jewellers: Reinicke & Co., tobacco nists ; Rice & Baulard, paints, etc.; Robin son & Co., newsdealers ; bar-room and Pal metto Hotel; thus making a clean sweep of the entire square. Colin Brothers are under stood to be fully insured. Crossing Mechanic street from the Pal metto House, the sparks soon kindled a flame in the roof of the theatre, and thence to the picture establishment of Mr. Van zile, grocery store of Mr. Hartley, the restaurant of Mr. Brette, boot and shoe store and fruit stand occupied by parties whose names are unknown, in the other direction from the thewtrc it first t<?ok the barber-shop, and then the saloon and board ing-house of Philip Dubie, 011 the corner oi Market and Twenty-fourth streets. The ind carried sparks across Market to the frame building known as Giradin's Hall, occupied by a colored man as a billiard and drinking saloon : thence it took tin gun and ammunition store of Joseph Labadie, and the large ice-house of S. 15. Lewis k Co. "NVhen the fire reached the cartridges in Labadie's store, the explosions reminded many an old soldier's heart of the rtormy days around Yieksburg and Port Hudson. Fortunately, most of the ward robe-; belonging to members of the theatri cal company were saved, ul-o a part of the stage furniture. To the west the flames were driven from the corner of Twenty-fourth across to the grocery store of John tt. Ro^t k Co., the saloon and boarding-house of W. "YVerzlow, the dwelling-house belonging to V?". Richard mm, the boarding-house of Mrs. Davidson, the boarding-house of Mrs. Connolly, and thence through to the corner of Bath avenue. The flames had already crossed Market street, swept 0:1 to the westward, laying the entire district between Tremont "and Bath avenue a mass of smouldering ruins with the single exception of the new brick house, occupied by Mr. Thompson as a jew elry store, on the corner ol Tremont and Market. To the south all the buildings as far as Church street, between Bath avenue and Twenty-fourth street, are consumed, and .ill (li* the Mo?*k between Tremont and Twenty-lVuirth streets and Market and Post Office streets. J11 short, the only houses left standing 011 the ground between the Strand and Church street and Tremont street and Bath avenue are Ufiord, Armstrong, and Berlocher buildings; from the corner of Mechanic street to the alley-way the frame store formerly occupied bv Bernstein & Co., and the buildings fronting Tremont street from Samuel Harlan's to the alley, fronting on Tremont street; the fine brick, but just finished, on the coiner of Tremont and Market streets, and the frame buildings 011 Tremont street between Post-Office and Church streets. The total loss is generally estimated at about ?1,000,000, but this can only be con sidered approximate. The amount insured by our old Home Union Fire and Marine Company is about 8-10,000. In the Merchants Mutual Insurance Company building, on the Strand, one of the finest in the city, the following firms had their offices : George Butler & Co., C. II. Jordan, Neill Brothers k Co., A. J. Ward k Co., Dubie k Woosters, Allen, Lewis A Co., and A, C. A M. W. Baker; all cotton factors and commission merchants. The heaviest sufferers by this terrible lire are of course the smaller "class of property owners, many of whom have lost their all: and some of them will probably need as sistance to save their families from suifer ing. The Galveston Civilian of the 4th instant has the following additional particulars : The extent of the conflagration covers nearly six blocks of the city, comprising about twelve acres of ground, in one of the 1 nest densely built and commercially occu pied portions of the town. The Tremont Temple was entirely consumed. The the atre, which was entirely consumed, bclong inging to Messrs. Greenwall k Brother, managers, was a wooden structure. The local insurance companies have at once come forward in the most liberal spirit, and assured their policy-holders that they are ready promptly to pay up their losses", and this will of itself afford a large and im mediate relief to many sufferers, and enable them at once to resume business. The loss of Colin Brothers is put down at ?175,000 ; Burns & Gee, ?30,000 ; Craig & Ruff, ?5,000; E. O. Lynch, ?5,000 ; W. A. Davy, ?5,000; the McDonald building, ?5,000; Merchants Mutual Insurance building, $63,000; M. M. Robinson, ?7,000 ; P. Dubie, $8,000; .T. K. Magale, ?50,000; and J. Berlocher, $10,000.

VIRGINIA NEWS. The Lynchburg: and Covington Rail road In Lexington. Correspondence of the Richmond Dispatch. Lexington, Va., December 11,18?9. The Lynchburg delegation, consisting of Major T. J. Kirkpatrick, C. V ."Winfree.'T. A. Krise, and Major J. B. Brockenborough, arrived this morning by packet, and held an informal conference with some of our leading citizens. The meeting, whicb assembled at 12 o'clock, was not large In numbers, but was a fair representation of the sentimeuts of Rockbridge. General s. McP. Moore was called to tho chair, and Major J. J. Laffertv appointed secretary. The Chairman explained thai the object of the meeting was to hear certain propo sitions from the Lynchburg delegation, and called out Major Kirkpatrick," who pro ceeded to give a clear statement of the cir cumstances and objects which brought the delegation here. Lynchburg had nlwavs desired a road to the Ohio, and years ago had obtained a charter for that purpose; hut now that the new owners of the Chesa peake and Ohio railroad are likely to push on, a connection between Lynchburg and Covington was rendered the more desira ble and more likely t.o he built. The new company simply wanted to make money, and the grades from Covington toKichmond were so heavv and the line so circuitous that they would favor the filling up of this gap of sixty miles. He earnestly and ably urged the impor J tance of emptying the treasures of the coal fields of the West along the line of James river. This must and will he built; the question is, Ought "Rockbridge to go for It? He was aware that the county had certain ! complications with the Vallev railroad, and he would make not the slightest objection to that. If you can get that road do so, and ! then consider whether Rockbridge can't help both, fie argued to show that Bnlti I more had no interest in the Valley railroad beyond Staunton. But that will soon he de termined by the vote of the city. This new line can be built at small cost,?three mil lions at the outside?and if a half million can bo rai?cd on this side, the private and corporation subscription on the other side and the credit of the consolidated line to j Norfolk will build the road in a very short | time. The Norfolk and Petersburg and ! Southside railroads already have a charter, and tlie right of way is thus guaranteed. Major J. Ji. Brockenborough, being called, said that all his sympathies were with Rock bridge, his native county, and (hat ho would not go for any measure that was not for her good. Ho ably and graphically urged the importance of this road and its value to Virginia. He would say frankly that Lynch burg did not propose to lmild the "road ' alone, hut wanted Rockbridge to join hands with her. Tn plain English, he proposed that the county should transfer to this new route the four hundred thousand dollars ? she had voted to the Valley railroad. He urged that the great want of Rock bridge is a railroad, and argued that there was not much probability that the " Valley railroad" will he built beyond Staunton. Baltimore has not yet acte'd, Augusta has voted down the subscription, and Mr. Gar rett has done nothing tangible. He was authorized to say that If Rockbridge would make this transfer the eredit of the South side and Norfolk and Petersburg railroads would he pledged to the extension; that Lynchburg, Norfolk,and tliecountiesalong the line, would subscribe liberally, and that the road would he hunt wunm tne next ; two or three years. On the other hand, lie argued that Balti more 1ms no interest in the Valley road be yond Staunton. Richmond is "the great grain market of the country, and grain being our staple it would go there by canal even' if Baltimore had the line to' Salem built. Baltimore now virtually owns a line which taps the Virginia and Tennessee at Lynchburg, and is twenty-two miles nearer to Salem than tiie Valley railroad would be, and it is a notorious fact that the Baltimore and Ohio railroad is buying up all of the stock of the Virginia and Tennessee rail road that is put upon the market. As for the "air line" from Covington to Richmond, he did not believe that could be built, on account of the heavy grades, and argued to show that it would be better for Richmond to unite on the new line, and have an air line to Richmond. Jle ably and eloquently argued that this line had best be built by Virginians, and controlled to foo ter Virginia enterprise and build up Vir ginia cities, lie contended that if Rock bridge could only have one railroad, she ought to ureter this new line. General S. McDowell Moore said that we must have a railroad, and lie would go for that scheme which would surest and soon est bring us one. h'c have three chances. Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Lynchburg, were all in the field. We are pledged to Baltimore if she complies with the terms. lie was disposed to think that the bc.-t chance for a railroad is from the Pennsylva nia Central bv way of the Page valley. They have both motive and money. lie preferred communication with Norfolk and Richmond if we can get it, but was rather afraid that the new scheme could not get the capital. lie offered.resolutions to ap point a committee of correspondence with all of these interests to ascertain which can soonest give us a railroad. He was for ascer taining which would do this, and then he was cordially in favor of that. Major ./.*/?. JDorman thought that de cidedly the best railroad for Rockbridge was this new route, and he would build this first, if he could. But he thought it not wise to divert the subscription from the Valley railroad until we see what Baltimore will do and know more about the new line, lie suggested that the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Southsidc railroads might have a common trunk from Clifton Forge to Lexington, and then diverge? the one to Lynchburg and the other to Richmond. lie would work fur the new scheme, and if Baltimore does not act promptly lie would go for the transfer of our subscription, lie went jirst fer Virginia and her interests. Colonel F. T. Anderson then offered the following, which were accepted as a substi tute for General Moore's : "Resolved, That this meeting are earn estly in favor of the projected road from Lynchburg to Clifton Forge, or some other point on the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad, md deem it to the interest of the people ind county of Rockbridge to aid all in their power to the accomplishment of that great work ; and that a committee be appointed o confer with the friends of this new route yy correspondence or otherwise. "4< 2. Resolved, That, in the opinion of this Meeting, the county of Rockbridge is dodged to make good her subscription to he Valley railroad, provided the city of Baltimore and county of Augusta comply vitli the conditions, and assurance is made aire that the road will be speedily com >leted through her territory." General F. II. Smith earnestly and ably dvocated the new route as the best lor tockbridge and Virginia. Colonel William Allan made an able and ngeuious speech against the change, and in avor of the Valley'railroad, the best for the ountv. He was* more hopeful now than ver that this road would be speedily built, nd he believed that the Lynchburg and Jovington and the " air line ' to Richmond rould also be built in course of time. We egret that we have not space for a full ro od of his speech and of those of other gen temen who addressed the meeting. A proposition to postpone action was ist, and Colonel Anderson's resolutions rcre then unanimously passed. Lexington. Letter from Oinrlottesville. Correspondence of the Richmond Dispatch.

The struggle going on between the Ways and Means Committee and the Banking and Currency Committee for jurisdiction over matters of finance, e spec'ally the question relative to a return to specie payments, is likely to result in the givingof the subjects to the latter committee. Each committee desires to have the credit of originatingand preparing a plan to return to specie pay ments. There is chance for Buncombe in it. A rule of the House and its origin clearly show that the Banking and Currency Com mittee is the proper body in which incuba tion should take place. Hon. S. S. Cox. ""hen formerly in Congress, originated a rule by which subjects previously swallowed up in the Ways and Means Committee were handed over to a new committee, and out of this proposition was organized the Ap propriation and Banking and Currency Com mittees, and it was resolved that the Ways and Means Committee be Intrusted with the mode of raising revenue ; the Appro priation Committee, purposes of disburse ment; and the Banking and Currency Com mittee, questions affecting the currency, specie payments, and matters pertaining to finance in the general acceptation of that term. DEPARTMENT OP INTERNAL REVENUE. The proposition to make a Department of Internal Revenue meets with general ap probation among senators and representa tives, and there is reason to believe that a bill for that purpose will pass in Congress early in January. There is no disposition to take up that or any other subject that floes not require immediate action until af ter the holidays. It is understood that Mr. Delano will be the new member of the Cabi net should the hill pass. CUBA?BELLIGERENT RIGnTS. When the House gets into Committee of j the Whole on the .State of the Union, Mr. Fitch (Republican member from Nevada) proposes to make a speech in favor of ac cording belligerent rights to Cuban insur gents. His name is the second on the speak ers' list for Committee of the Whole. Mr. Fitch has the repute of an eloquent and ac complished orator. His argument will go to show that the insurgents have estab lished a de facto government, and all the facts and circumstances, as well as the unanimous sentiment of the citizens of the United States, demand that our Govern ment should accord belligerent rights to struggling Cubans. OBJECTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINATIONS FOP. CIRCUIT JUDGES. It was supposed the President's nomina tions for new circuit judges would he promptly confirmed by the Senate, but tiiere is a halt upon three of the nominees, and some threatenings as to two others. Objections are made that Mr. McKennon, of Pennsylvania, nominated for the third circuit, has not had sufficient experience in judicial practice; that Mr. Yea'man, of Kentucky, nominated for the sixth circuit, is not sound on political questions, and is not much of a lawyer; and thai Judge Pcarre, of 31d., nominated for the fourth circuit, was once charged with the offence of making use of a cancelled three-cent postage stamp. Upon inquiry it is found this charge is based on an occurrence of more than twenty years ago; that when made it was promptly met by Judge Pearre; that the then Postmaster-General directed the instant dismissal of the* ease, so utterly unfounded and malicious was the imputation, and that charge has not since been trumped up until Judge l'earre was nominated to the Senate. Friends of a prominent Maryland com petitor for the position are said to be re sponsible for the resurrection of the impu tation on Judge Pcarre's character. The Senate will confirm the nomination, and probably all remain except Teaman, whose nomination, report says, has been withdrawn. 

SENATOR DRAKE WANTS TnE SUPREME COURT AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTION SET ASIDE. Senator Drake let otl a characteristic speech in the Senate to-day in support of his bill to set aside the United States Su preme Court and the Federal Constitution by the passage of one little act of Congress. The burthen of his song was that we should fall back upon the people for decisions of disputed questions, and their voice Would be far better and stronger a thousand times than the judgment of jurists, even if there were a supreme court sitting in every room and hall of the capitol. Such was the way this profound expounder of the Constitu tion put it. His argument abounded with legal here sies and propositions that the merest tyro at law would be ashamed to advance.
