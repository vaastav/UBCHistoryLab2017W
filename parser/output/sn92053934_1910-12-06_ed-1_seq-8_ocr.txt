THE ROCK ISLAND ARGUS. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1910. 8 HE PAYNE -TARIFF SSA.GE IN ME FAFT D NDS T Washington. Dec. 6. President Taft sent his annual message to congress today. It is as follows : To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: During the past year the foreign re lations of the United States have con tinued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding. The year has been notable as wit nessing: the pacific settlement of two Important international controversies before the permanent court of The Hague. The arbitration of the fisheries dis pute between the United States and Great Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspondence since the fisheries con vention of 181S, has given an award which is satisfactory to both parties. This arbitration is particularly note worthy not only because of the emi nently just results secured, but also be cause It Is the first arbitration held un der the general arbitration treaty of April 4, 1908. between the United States and Great Britain and disposes of a controversy the settlement of .which for nearly ninety years has been Jthe cause of friction between two 'countries whose common interest lies in maintaining the most friendly and ieordial relations with each other. The United States was ably repre sented before the tribunal. The com plicated history of the questions aris ing made the issue depend more than ordinarily in such cases upon the care and skill with which our case was jpresented. and I should be wanting in proper recognition of a great patriotic Iservice if I did not refer to the lucid historical analysis of the facts and the signal ability and force of argument six days in length-ipresented to the court in support cf our case by Mr. Elihu Root. As secretary of state Mr. 'Root had given close study to the in tricate facts bearing on the coutro jversy and by diplomatic correspond lence had helped to frame the issues. At the solicitation of the secretary of 'state and myself Mr. Root, though bur Id ened by his duties as senator from New Tork. undertook the preparation jof the case as leading counsel, with !the condition imposed by himself that in view of his position as senator lie should not receive any compensation. The tribunal constituted at The Hague by the governments of the Unit ed States and Venezuela lias completed its deliberations and has rendered an award in the case of the Orinoco Steamship company against Venezuela. The award may be regarded as satisfac tory since it has. pursuant to the con tentious of the United States, recog juized a number of important principles 'making for a judicial attitude in the determining of international disputes. In view of grave doubts which tjad been raised as to the constitutionality of The Hague convention for the es tablishment of an international prize court, now before the senate for ratifi- Ication. because of that provision of the (convention which provides that there ;may be an appeal to the proposed court fro:n the decisions of national courts, this government proposed in an identic circular note addressed to those powers ;whieh had taken part in the Loudon jniaritime conference that the powers signatory to the convention, if con 'fronted with such difficulty, might In sert a reservation to the effect that ap peals to the international prize court !in respect to decisions of its national tribunals should take the form of a di rect claim for compensation, that the 'proceedings thereupon to be taken Ishould be in the form of a trial de novo land that judgment of the court should (consist of compensation for the illegal capture irrespective of the decision of the national court whoso judgment had 'thus been internationally involved. 1 As the result of au informal discus Won it was decided to provide such pro cedure by means of a separate protocol 'which should be ratified at the same Itlme as the prize court convention lt Iself. Accordingly the government of the Netherlands at the request of this gov ernment proposed under date of May 24. 1010, to the powers signatory to The Hague convention the negotiation of a supplemental protocol embodyiry ooooo-oooooooocoooooooooooo coococecoccocooooooooooooo I Every I Little 0 Movement g a Q Q Sheltered in one of our stan- Q O dard watch cases are gems as O 8 timekeepers.

RAMSER Jeweler Opposite Harper Hoasa. ccooooocotx;ocooccx5oecoceoo -GOGOOGOGGGOOOOOOOOGOOOQOOQ stipulations providing for this alterna tive procedure. It Is gratifying to ob serve that this additional protocol is being signed without objection by the powers signatory to the original con vention and that there is every reason to believe that the international prize court will be soon established. The identic circular note also pro posed that the international prize court when established should be endowed with the functions of an arbitral court of justice under and pursuant to the recommendation adopted by the last Hague conference. The replies receiv ed from the various powers to this pro posal inspire the hope that this also may be accomplished within the rea sonably near future. It Is believed that the establishment of these two tribunals will go a long way toward securing the arbitration of many, questions which have heretofore threatened and at times destroyed the ! peace of nations. TO APPOINT PEACE COMMIS SIONERS. President Is Waiting For Expres sions From Foreign Powers. Appreciating these enlightened tend encies of modern times, the congress at its last session passed a law provid ing for the appointment of a commis sion of five members "to be appointed by the president of the United States to consider the expediency of utilizing existing international agencies for the purpose of limiting the armaments of the nations of the world by interna tional agreement and of constituting the combined navies of the world an International force for the preserva tion of universal peace and to consider and report otpon any other means to diminish the expenditures of govern ment for military purposes and to lessen the probabilities of war." I have uot as yet made appointments to this commission because I have in vited and am awaiting the expressions of foreign governments as to their will inpness to co-operate with us in the appointment of similar commissions or representatives who would meet with our commissioners and by joint action seek to make their work effective. Europe, Canada, Etc. Several important treaties have been negotiated with Great Britain in the past twelve months. A preliminary diplomatic agreement has been reach ed regarding the arbitration of pecu niary claims which each government has against the ether. This agree ment, with the schedules of claims annexed, will, as srxm as the schedules are arranged, bo submitted to the sen ate for approval. An agreement between the United States and Great Britain with regard to the location of the international boundary lie between the United States and Canada in Passamaquoddy bay aud to the middle of Graud Ma han channel was reached in a treaty concluded May 21. 1910. which has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed, thus making unnecessary the arbitration provided for in the previous treaty of April 11. 1008. The convention concluded Jan. 11. 199. between the United States and Great Britain providing for the settle ment of international differences be tween the United States and Canada, including the apportionment between the two countries of certain of the boundary waters and the appointment of commissioners to adjust certain oth er questions, has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed. The work of the international fish eries commission appointed in 1903. under the treaty of April 11. 1908. be tween Great Britain and the United .States has resulted in the formulation and recommendation, of uniform regu lations governing the fisheries of the boundary waters of Canada and the United States for the purpose of pro tecting and increasing the supply of food fish In such waters. In comple tion of this work the regulations agreed upon require congressional leg islation to make them effective and for their enforcement in fulfillment of the treaty stipulations. 

OVERTHROW OF KING MANUEL United States Recognized Portugal Provisional Kepublic. In October last the monarchy in Portugal was overthrown, a provision al republic was proclaimed, and there was set up a de facto government which was promptly recognized by the government of the United States for purposes of ordinary Intercourse pend ing formal recognition by this and oth er powers of the governmental entity to be duly established by the national sovereignty. Liberia. A disturbance among the native tribes of Liberia in a portion of the re public during the early part of this year resulted In the sending under the treaty of 18G2 of an American vessel of war to the disaffected district, and the Liberian authorities, assisted by the jood offices of the American naval officers, were able to restore order. The negotiations which have been un dertaken for the amelioration of the conditions found in Liberia by the American commission, whose report 1 transmitted to congress on March 25 last, are being brought to conclusion. and.it is thought that within a short time practical measures of relief may be put into effect through the good of fices of this government and the eor ilal co-operation of other governments Interested in Liberia's welfare. The Near East Turkey. To return the visit of the special eci- bassy sent t announce the accession of his majes-y Mehemet V., emperor of the Ottomans. 1 sent to Constanti nople a special ambassador, who, in addition to this mission ot ceremony, was charged with the duty ot express ing to the Ottoman government the value attached by the government of the United States to increased and more important relations between the countries and the desire of the United States to contribute to the larger eco nomic and commercial development due to the new regime in Turkey. The rapid development now begin ning In that ancient empire and the marked progress and Increased com mercial importance of Bulgaria. Rou mania and Servia make it particularly opportune that the possibilities of American commerce in the near east should receive due attention. Montenegro. The national skoupchtina having ex pressed its wi";l that the principality of Montenegro be raised to the rank of kingdom, the Prince of Montenegro on Aug. 15 last assumed the title of kiug of Montenegro. It gave me pleasure to accord to the new kingdom the rec ognition of the United States. The Far East. The center of interest in far eastern affairs during the past year has again been China. It is gratifying to note that the ne gotiations for a loan to the Chinese government for the construction of the trunk railway lines from Hankow southward to Canton and westward through the Yangtse valley, known as the Hukuang loan, were concluded by the representatives of the various financial groups in May last aud the results approved by their respective governments. The agreement, already iuitlaled by the Chinese goverument. is now awaiting formal ratification. The basis of the settlement of theterms of this loan was one of exact equality be tween America. Great Britain, France and Germany in respect to financing the loan and supplying materials for the proposed railways and their future branches. The application of the principle un derlying the policy of the Uuitod States in regard to the Hrkuang loan viz. that of the internationalization of the foreign interest in such of the railways of China as may be financed by for eign countries was suggested on a broader scale by the secretary of state In a proposal tor internationalization and ' commercial neutralization of all the railways of Manchuria. While the principle which led to the proposal of this government was generally admit ted by the powers to whom it was ad dressed, the governments of Kusski and Japan apprehended praetr-al difficul ties in the execution of the larger plan which prevented their ready adher ence. The question of constructing the Chinchow-Aiguu railway by means of an international loan to China is, bow ever, still the subject of friendly dis cussion, by the interested parties. The policy of this government in these matters lias been directed by a desire to make the use of American capital in the development of China au instrument in the promotion of China's welfare r.i:d material prosperity with out prejudice to her legitimate rights as an independent political power. This jK.licy has recently found fur ther exemplification ia t'.ie assistance given by this government to the nego tiations betweeu China and a group of American bankers for a loan of $50. 000.000 to be euip'oyod chiefly in cur rency reform. The confusion which has from ancient times existed In the monetary usages cf the Chinese lias been one of the principal obstacles to commercial intercourse with that peo ple. The United States in Its treaty of 1903 with China obtained a pledge from the latter to introduce a uniform national coinage, and the following year, at the request of China, this gov ernment scut to Peking a member of the international exchange commission to discuss with the Chinese govern ment the best methods of introducing the reform. In 1908 China sent a com missioner to the United States to con sult with American financiers as to the possibility of securing a large loan with which to inaugurate the new cur rency system, but the death of their majesties the empress dowager and the emperor of China interrupted the ne gotiations, which were not resumed un til a few months ago. when this gov ernment was asked to communicate to the bankers concerned the request of Chiua for a loan of .$50,000,000 for the purpose under review. A preliminary agreement between the American group and China has been made covering the loan. For the success xt this loan and the contemplated reforms which are of the greatest importance to the commercial Interests of the United States and the civilized world at large It is realized that an expert will be necessary, and this government has received assur ances from China that such an advis er, who shall be an American, will be engaged. It is a matter of interest to Ameri cans to irnte the success which Is at tending the efforts of China to estab lish gradually a system of representa tive government. The provincial as semblies were opened in October, 1909, and in October of the present year a consultative body, the nucleus of the future national parliament, held its first session at Poking. The year has further ben mnrtced by two important intcrnathejcl agree ments relating to far eKstern .u.'3. Ia the Russo-Japanese agroemfit re lating to Manchuria, signed July 4. 1910. this government was gratlflei to note an "assurance of continue! peaceful conditions in that region and the reaffirmation of the policies with respect to China to which the United Gtates together with all other lute? ested powers are alike solemnly com mitted. The treaty annexing Korea to the empire of Japan, promulgated Aug. 29. 1G10, marks the final step in a process of coutrol of the ancient em pire by her powerful neighbor that has been in progress for several years past. In communicating the fact of annexa tion the Japanese government gave to the government of the United States assurances of the full protection of the rights of American citizens In Ko rea under the changed conditions. Friendly visits of many distinguish ed persons from the far east have been made during the year. Chief amo&g these were their imperial highnesses Trinces Tsal-tao and Tsal-Hsun of China and his imperial highness Prince nigashl Fushimi and Prince Tokugawa. president of the bouse ot peers of Japan. The secretary of wat has recently visited Japan and China In connection with his tour to the Philippines, and a large delegation of American business men are at present traveling In China. This exchange of friendly visits has had the happy ef fect of even furtherstrengthening our friendly international relations. 

TROUBLES OF LATIfl AMERICA. e Are at Peace, but War Bothers Southern Republics. During the past year several of our southern sister republics celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of their Independence. In honor of these events special embassies were 6ent from this country to Argentina, Chile and Mexico, where the gracious re ception and splendid hospitality ex tended them manifested the cordial relations and friendship existing be tween those countries and the United States, relations which I am happy to believe have never before been upon so high a plane and so solid a basis as at present. The congressional commission ap pointed under a concurrent resolution to attend the festivities celebrating the centennial- anniversary of Mexican independence, together with a special ambassador, were received with the highest honors and with the greatest cordiality and returned with the report of the bounteous hospitality and warm reception of President Diaz and the Mexican people, which left no doubt of the desire of the immediately neigh boring republic to continue the mutual ly beneficial and Intimate relations which I feel sure the two governments will ever cherish. At the fourth pan-American confer ence, which met in Buenos Aires dur ing July and August last after seven weeks of harmonious deliberation three conventions were signed provid ing for the regulation of trademarks, patents and copyrights, which, when ratitied by the different governments, will go far toward furnishing to Amer ican authors, patentees and owners of trademarks the protection needed In localities where heretofore it has been either lacking or inadequate. Further, a convention for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was signed and a number of Important resolutions pass ed. The conventions will In due course be transmitted to the senate, ard the report of the delegation of the United States will be communicated to the congress for its information. The special cordiality between representa tive men from all parts of America which was shown at this conference cannot fail to react upon and draw still closer the relations between the countries which took part in it The International bureau of Ameri can republics Is doing a broad and use ful work for pan-American commerce and comity. Its' duties were much en larged by the international conference of American states at Buenos Aires, and its name was shortened to the more practical and expressive term of pan-American union. Located now in its new building, which was specially dedicated April 20 of this year to the development of friendship, trade and peace among the American nations, it has improved instrumentalities to serve the twenty-two republics of this hem isphere. I am glad to say that the action of the United States in its desire to re move imminent danger of war between Peru and Ecuador growing out of a boundary dispute, with the co-operation of Brazil and the Argentine Re public as joint mediators with this gov ernment, has already resulted success fully in preventing war. The govern ment of Chile, while not one of the mediators, lent effective aid in further ance of a preliminary agreement likely to lead on to an amicable settlement, and It is not doubted that the good ofhees of the mediating powers and the conciliatory co-oneration of the govern ments directly interested will finally lead to a removal of this perennial cause of friction between Ecuador and Peru. The inestimable value of cordial co-operation between the sister repub lics of America for the maintenance of peace In this hemisphere has never been more clearly shown than In this mediation, by which three American governments have given to this hemis phere the honor of first invoking the most farreaching provisions of The Hague convention for the pacific set tlement of International disputes. There has been signed by the repre sentatives of the United States and Mexico a protocol hubmitting to the United "States-Alexiean boundary com mission (wbos membership for the purpose of this esse Is to be increased by the addition of a cltlzep of Can ada) the question of sovereignty over the Chamizal tract, which lies within the present physical boundaries of the city of El Paso. Tex. The determina tion jot this question will remove a source of no little annoyance to the two governments. The republic of Honduras has for many years been burdened with a heavy bonded debtJield in Europe, the Interest on which long ago fell In ar rears. Finally conditions were such that it became imperative to refund the debt and place the finances of the republic upon a sound basis. Last year a group of American bankers un dertook to do this and to advance funds for railway and other Improve ments contributing directly to the country's prosperity and commerce an arrangement which has long been de sired by this government Negotiations to this end have beeo under way for more than a year, and it is now confi dently believed that a short time will suffice to conclude an arrangement which will be satisfactory to the for eign creditors, eminently advantageous to Honduras and highly creditable to the judgment and foresight of the Honduranean government. This is much to be desired since, as recognized by the Washington conventions, a strong Honduras would tend immense ly to the progress and prosperity of Central America. During the past year the republic of Nicaragua has been the scene of in ternecine struggle. General Zelaya. for seventeen years the absolute ruler of Nicaragua, was throughout his ca reer the disturber of Central America and opposed every plan for the pro motion of peace and friendly relations between the five republics. When the people of Nicaragua were finally driven into rebellion by his law less exactions he violated the laws of war by the unwarranted execution, of two American citizens who had regu larly enlisted In the ranks of the rev olutionists. This and other offenses made it the duty of the American gov- ernment to take measures with a view to ultimate reparation and for the j safeguarding of its interests. ! Thls involved the breaking oft of all j diplomatic relations with the Zelaya j government for the reasons laid down In a communication from the secretary j of state, which also notified the con- i tending factions In Nicaragua that this i j government would hold each to strict j accountability for outrages on the i rights of American citizens. American I forces were sent to both coasts of Ni ! caragua to be in readiness should oc i casion arise to protect Americans and ! their interests and remained there un ! til the war was over and peace had j returned to that unfortunate country. ! These events, together with Zelaya's eontimied exactions, brought him so clearly to the bar of public opinion that he was forced to resign and to take refuge abroad. In the above mentioned communica tion of the secretary of state to the charge d'affaires of the Zelaya govern ment the opinion was expressed that the revolution represented the wishes of the majority of the NIcaraguan peo ple. This has now been proved beyond doubt by the fact that since the com plete overthrow of the Madriz govern- j ment and the occupation of the capital by the forces of the revolution all fac j Hons have united to maintain public or- dor, and as a result of discussion with an agent of this government sent to Ma I nagua at the request of the provisional i government comprehensive plans are ' being made for the future welfare of I Nicaragua, including the rehabilitation j of public credit. The moderation and I conciliatory spirit shown by the vnrl ! ous factions give ground for the con fident hope that Nicaragua will soon take its rightful place among the law abiding and progressive countries of the world. It gratifies me exceedingly to an nounce that the Argeutine Republic some months ago placed with American manufacturers a contract for the con struction of two battleships and certain additional naval equipment. The ex tent of this work and its Importance to the Argentine Republic make the plac ing of the bid an earnest of friendly feeling toward the United States. Tariff Negotiation. The new tariff law in section 2 re specting the maximum and minimum tariffs of the United States, which pro visions came into effect on April 1. 1910, imposed upon the president the i responsibility of determining prior to that date whether or not any undue discrimination existed against the Unit ed States-and its products in any coun try of the world with which we sus tained commercial relations. In the case of several countries in stances of apparent undue discrimina tion against American commerce were found to exist These discriminations were removed by negotiation. Prior to April 1, 1910. when the maximum tariff was to come into operatiou with respect to importations from all those countries In whose favor no proclama tion applying the. minimum tariff should be issued by the president, 13-1 such proclamations were Issued. This series of proclamations embraced the entire commercial world, and hence the minimum tariff of the United States has been given universal appli cation, thus testifying to the satisfac tory character of our trade relations with foreign countries. Marked advantages to the commerce of the United States were obtained through these tariff settlements. For eign nations are fully cognizaut of the fact that under section 2 of the tariff act the president is required, when ever he Is satisfied that the treat ment accorded by them to the prod ucts of the United States Is not. such is to entitle them to ?he benefits of the minimum tariff of the United States, to withdraw those benefits by ti .-. matlon. giving ninety da'jH wtce; after whicJj taa mx'oium tariff jvill apply to their dutiable prorrncrs enter ing the United States. In Its general operation this section of the tariff law las thus far Ted a guaranty of continued comrAaStlal peace, although there are. however, unfortunately In stances where foreign governments deal arbitrarily with American inter ests within their jurisdiction In a man ner injurious and inequitable. The policy of broader and closer trade relations with the Dominion of Canada which was initialed in the ad justment ot the maximum and mini mum provisions of the tariff act of August, 1909, has proved mutually beneficial. It Justifies further efforts for the readjustment of the commer cial relations of the two countries so that their commerce may follow the channels natural to contiguous coun tries and be commensurate with the steady expansion of trade and indus try on both sides of the boundary line. The reciprocation on the part of the Dominion government of the sentiment which was expressed by this govern ment was followed in October by the suggestion that it would be glad to have the negotiations which had been temporarily suspended during the sum mer resumed. In accordance with this fuggestiou the secretary of state by my direction dispatched two represent atives of the department of state as special commissioners to Ottawa to confer with representatives of the Do minion government. They were au-" tborized to take such steps for formu lating a reciprocal trade agreement as might be necessary and to receive and consider any propositions which the Dominion government 'might care to submit Pursuant to the instructions Issued conferences were held by these com missioners with officials of the Domin ion government at Ottawa in the early part of November. The negotiations were conducted on both sides in a spirit of mutual accom modation. The discussion of the com mon commercial interests of the two countries had for its object a satisfac tory basis for a Trade arrangement which offers the prospect of a freer in terchange for the products of the Unit ed States and of Canada. The confer ences were adjourned to be resumed in Washington in January, when it is hoped that the aspiration of both gov ernments for a mutually advantageous measure of reciprocity will be realized. THE 

DEPARTMENT OF STATE. Foreign Trade Is Improving Mer chant Marine Development. All these tariff negotiations, so vital to ouY commerce and industry, and the duty of Jealousy guarding the equi table and just treatment of our prod ucts, capital aud industry abroad de volve upon the department of state. The Argentine battleship contracts, like the subsequent important one for Argentine railway equipment and those for Cuban govertynent vessels, were secured for our manufacturers largely through the good offices of the depart ment of state. The efforts of that department to se cure for citizens of the United States equal opportunities in the markets of the world and to expand American commerce have been most successful. The volume of business obtained in nety fields of competition and upon new lines is already very great, and cougress Is urged to continue to sup port the department of state iu its en deavors for further trade expansion. Our foreign trade merits the best support of the government and the most earnest endeavor of our manu facturers and merchants, who. if they do not already In all cases need a for eign market, are certain soon to be come dependent on it. Therefore, now Is the time to secure a strong position in this field. I cannot leave this subject without emphasizing the necessity of such leg islation as will make possible a:id con venient the establishment of American banks and brandies of American banks in foreign countries. Only by such means can our foreign trade be favor ably financed, necessary credits be ar ranged and proper avail be made of commercial opportunities iu foreign countries, and most especially In Latiu America. Another instrumentality indispensa ble to the unhampered and natural de velopment of American commerce is merchant marine. All maritime and commercial nations recognize the im portance of this factor. The greatest commercial nations, our competitors, jealously foster their merchant ma rine. Perhaps nowhere Is the neivl for rapid and direct mail, passenger and freight communication quite so urgent as between the United States and Latin America. We can secure in no other quarter of the world such imme diate benefits In friendship and com merce as would flow from the estab lishment of direct lines of communica tion with the countries of Latiu Amer ica adequate to meet the requirements of a rapidly Increasing appreciation of the reciprocal dependence of the coun tries of the western hemisphere upon each other's products, sympathies aud assistance. I alluded to this most Important sub ject in my last annual message. It has often been before you. and I need not recapitulate the reasons for Its recom mendation. Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama cii.il will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail in 'nternatlonal maritime business of this irent contribution to the means of the world's commercial Intercourse. Quito CikV trwr commercial ex pect, unless t c crests u raeaT'iis-vN r-'y rlne where can we find the seafaring (MKjjsrton necessary as a natural na val reserve and where could we find, in case of war. the transports and sub sidiary vessels without which a novel fleet -Is arms without n body? For many reasons I cannot too strongly trpe upon the congress the passage cf l measure by mail subsidy or other isubvention adequate to guarantee ths j establishment and rapid development j jof an American merchant marine, the i restoration of the American Hag to Its jiancient place upon the seas. With our Increasing International ln i terconrse it becomes incumbent upon j me to repeat more emphatically than I ever the recommendation which I I made in my inaugural address that congress shall at once give to the I courts of the United States Jurisdic- tion to punish as a crime the violation I of the rights of aliens secured by trca 1 ty with the United States in order that j the general government of the United i States shall be able when called upon j by a friendly nation to redeem Its I isolemn promise by treaty to secure to J ,the citizens or subjects of that nation resident in the United States freedom j :f rom violence and due process of law ' la respect to their life, liberty and property. I also and for the same general rea sons strongly commend to the favora ble action of the cougress the enact ment of a law applying to the diplo matic aud consular service the princi ples embodied in section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, in the civil service act of Jan. 10, 1883. and the executive orders of June 17, 1900, and of Nov. 20, 1909. : The excellent results which have at tended the partial application of civil service principles to the diplomatic aud 'consular services are an earnest of the benefit to be wrought to both branches ot the foreign sen-ice. The marked Improvement In the consular service during the four years since the prin ciples of the civil service act were np- ! plied to that service In a limited way and the good results already notice able from a similar application of civil service principles to the diplomatic j service a year ago convince me that I the enactment into law of the general ' principles of the existing executive reg ! ulations could not fall to effect further 1 improvement of both branches of the ! foreign service, offering as It would ; by its assurance of permanency of 'tenure and promotion on merit an in i ducement for the entry of capable , 'young men Into the service and an in centive to those already in to put forth their best efforts to attain and maln- ! tain that degree of efficiency which the 1 interests of our international relations I and commerce demand. I j During many years past appeals have i been made from time to time to con ! gress In favor of government owner : ship of embassy and leptlon premises i abroad. Tha arguments in favor of ! such ownership have been many and oft repeated and are well known to : the congress. The acquisition by the ' government of suitable residences and i offices for Its diplomatic officers, espe ! cially In the capitals of the Latin Amer- lean states and of Europe, is so Impor tant and necessary to an Improved j diplomatic service that I have no hesl- tation in ur;ag upon the congress the I passage of some measure similar to that favorably reported by the house 1 committee on foreign affairs on Feb. j 14. 1910 (report No. 438). that would authorize the gradual and annual ac ! quisitlon of premises for diplomatic : use. 1 The work of the diplomatic service Is : devoid of partisanship. Its Importance should appeal to every American citi zen ami should receive the generoua : consideration of the congress. 

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. Estimates For Next Year's Expenses. Where Savings Have 3een Made. Every effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the etl rmited cost of his department for the ensuing flsejl year ending June 30, 1912. I say this Iu order lhat congress may understand that these estimates thus made present the smallest sum which will maintain the departments, bursitis am! offices of the government and meet IN other obligations under existlnc law Mid that a cut of these estimates would result in embarrassing the executive branch of the govern ment iu the performance of Its duties. This remark dors not apply to the river and harbor estimates, except to those for expenses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under au thorized contracts, nor docs It apply to the public building bill nor to the navy building program. Of course a, to these congrss could withhold any part or all of the estimates for them without Interfering with the discharge of the ordinary obligations of the gov-. ernment or the performance of the functions of its departments, bureaus and offices. The final estimates for the year end ing June 30. 1012. as they have leen sent to the treasury on Nov. 29 of this year for the ordinary expenses of the government. Including those for public buildings, rivers and harbors and the navy building program, amount to $030, 491.013.12. This Is $."2.90 1,887.31 less than the appropriations for the fiscal year eryllng June 30. 1911. It lJ $M. KS3,l.3.4i less than the total estimates. Including supplemental estimates sub mitted to congress by the treasury for the year 1911, and Is $r,574.C.iy.3l less than the original estimates submitted f y the treasury for 1911. These figures do not Include the ap propriations for the Panama canal, the policy in respect to which ought to be K. sr. trjt yeax as can t. mra;cTy aCectt; S.j expended in order to complete the ca nal as promptly as possible, and there fore the ordinary motive for cutting down the expense of the government does not apply to appropriations for this purpose. It will be noted that the estimates for the Panama canal for the enduing year are more than $.W 000,000, an Increase of $20,000,000 ovr
