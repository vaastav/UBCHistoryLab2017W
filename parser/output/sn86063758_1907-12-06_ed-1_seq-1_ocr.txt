VOL XLIV NO 98 NEWBERRY, S. C. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 6.1907.T METHODIST PREACHERS GIVEN ASSIGNMENTS F BISHOP SPRINGS SURPRISES b AT GAFFNBY CONFBRBNCE. As his Reason for so Many Changes c He Asserts His Belief . in Rota- ( tion in Office as Being Good I for Preachers. News and Courier. Gaffney, December 2.-Tonight I will be long remembered by the Methodists of South Carolina. It was ( expected that there would be many ( changes in the conference, but the I Bishop handed out a number of sur- ] prises. Before reading the appoint ments the bishop made a talk, set- ' ting forth his reason for making e changes. He said that no one was I reduced because of inefficiency, but because he believed in rotation of I the ministers both as to place and office. He thought it right that pre- t siding elders should go back into the ' pastorate and make some new ser mons and stay with their families. The bishop said he had had all the experiences of the pastorate and was not giving any appointments which I he himself had not had. His talk was well received. The conference was in a spiritual condition, having I just held an , experience meeting. I There were songs and witnessing, I and when the bishop arose to read 2 the appointments the body was in a . ten-Aer mood., The bishop begged all ( to tke their work without complaint A and do the best work of their lives.

STATE SUPREME COURT REVERSES DECISION Judgment in Case of $30,000 Fine In Favor of Railroad Com pany. Raleigh, N. C.. Dec. 4.- The StatE supreme court in a decision hande< down this evening reversed JudgE Long of the superior court in the matter .of a $30,000 fine imposed or the Southern Railway company fo: selling passenger tickets at a rate it excess of 2 1-4 cents, the state rate At the same time the opinion affirm the act of the court and the constitu tionality 'of the legislative act in prescribing . punishment of agent and officials of the road for selling tickets at-an excess rate, the biing ing of penalty suits of $500 each b: individuals against the corporatior for violation of the law, and holdinc that the federal court has no author ity to issue an injunction agains bringing suits, criminal or' civil against the railroad, as it would il thus enjoying a criminal action bE bringing a suit aginst the state which is forbidden by the Unite( States law, as the act of the legisla ture is self-operating as to passen ger fares and required no action 01 the part of the state. The opinion is of the four justice of the court and is dissented from b; Chief Justice Clarke, who holds tha if an agent be fined or imprisone< that the railroad can also be fine( as punishment for its acts in casus ing an agent to sell tickets at illega rates. In his dissenting opinion he in timates that the legislature should b called together in special session s as to make the act so explicit tha the railroads can be punished b; fines. Extra Session Not Needed. Associate 'Justice Brown, in a coa eurring,opinion with the court; say that there is no 'need of an extra ses sion of -tle legl ature, that if -th act as it stadds is enforced the rail roads could not stand a week's viola tion of it. The opinion sets out the followin; four points: First. That there was 'no error ii Judge Long compelling a trial of th ase. -Second. That the federal cour injunction was no defense to a erim inal ,aetion, no power lying in the fed eral court to enjoin a criminal prose ction. Third. That the rate law was self executing in effect and that no sui against the sate will hold in defiane of the 11th amendment to the consti tution. Fourth. That where a civil pen alty is prescribed aginst a corpora tion, followed by the creation of .riminal offense Against the agent of the corporatioil, the civil penalt; first prescribed relieves the corpora tion of punishment by indietment un der the criminal offense create' against the agent.

E. Green, who Wa: punished by fine. The act of the legislatr.ci prohibit a charge above 2 1-4 cents per mil' and then provides, in seetion 4, tha any railroad company violating thi provisions of the aet shall be liabli to a benalty of .9500 and the agent bi guilty of a misdemeanor. The doe trine is that where an offense 1i reated by statute and the same sta tute prescribes the penalty, or th mode of procedure, only that indi cted by statute shall be followed. Bu where the offense is at common law statutory provisions not directly re *punant .to the common law are umulative and either law may b~ followed.

Thinks Provision Should Be Made I for an Emergency Issue Upon Conditions Carefully Pre scribed by the Govern ment. Touching upon the question of cur rency reform President Roosevelt inj his message to congress says: "In my message to the congress a year ago I spoke as follows of the currency: "'I especially call your attention to the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably serv ed a great purpose in aiding the enor mous business development of the country, and within ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from ai.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been ac cumulating that additional legisla tion is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the de i fects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, be cause to I ave them as they are I means to incur liability of business - disaster. Since your body adjourn - ed there has been a fluctuation in i the interest on call money from 2 per cent. to 30 per cent., and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The see retary of the treasury had to step in and- by wise action put a stop to the most violent ped of oscillation. Even worse than eh fluctuation is 1 the advance in commercial rates and the uncertainty felt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial interests suffer during t each crop peridd. Excessive rates for call money in New York attract money from the interior ban1s into the speculative field. This depletes the 'fund that would: otherwise be available for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are. ferded to -y abnorroal rates, so that each faif a tax, in the shape of increased inter est charges, is plaeed on the whole commerce of the country. " 'The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system is seriously defective. There is need 6f a change. Unfortunately, how ever, many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration be e ause they are complicated, are not -easy of comprehension, and tend to disturb existing rights and, interests. -We must also rule out any- plan which would materi'ally impair the -value of t.he United States 2 per cent. bonds now pledged to secure' circulation, the issue of which was -made under conditions peculiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any especial plan. Various -plans have recently been propsed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly faasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly brought to year attention .by the present secretary of the treasury, the essential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. Accord ing to this plan national banks should be permitted to issue a specil fed proportion of their -eapital in' notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in leitimate trade. This plan would not permit the issue of currency to ive banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency presented by times of stringency. '' 'I do not say that this is the right system. I only advance it to' emphasize my belief that there is need fqr the adoption of some system which shall be automatic and openi to all sound banks, so as to avoid all possibility of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan would tend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now obtain in the New York market; for at pres eut there is too much .eurrency at eertain seasons of the year, and its aeeumulation at New York tempts: bankers to lend it at low rates for' speculative purposes; whereas at other times when the crops are being moved there is urgent need for a large temporary increase in the cur-' ~~ renysupl. It must never be - forgotten that this question concerns business men generally quite as much as bankers, farmers, and busi ness men in the west; for at present at certain seasons of the year the difference in interest rates between the east and the west is from 6 to 10 per cent., whereas in Canada the cor responding difference is but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of ' course, guard the interests of Western and Southern bankers as carefully as it guards the interests of New York or Chicago bankers, and must be diawn from the standpoints of the farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of the city banker and the country banker.' "I again urge on congress the need of immediate attention to this mat ter. We need a greater elasticity in our currency; provided, of course, that we. recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the national authori ties. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. The emer geney issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully pre scribed by the government. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securities approved by the government, and pst be issued un der, a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the de mand for it was urgent, while se curing its retirement as the demand fell off. It is worth investigating to determine whether officers and direc tors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companies should be subject to the same supervision as banks; legisla tiQn'- to .this effect should be enacted for the District of Columbia and the territories. "Yet we must also remember that. even the; wisest legislation on the subject can only aeeomplish a cer- . tain amount. No -legislatirnye 'y any -possibility guarantee the busi ness community. against the results of speculative folly any more than it can guarantee an -individual against the results of his extrava- - gance. When an individual mortga ges his hou e to buy an ,automobile- = he invites disaster; and when wealthy men who pose as such, or are un- - scrupulously or foolishly eaer to become rich, indulge in reckless spe ulation-especially if it is accom panied by dishone~stly-they jeopar- . dize not only their own future but the future of all their innocent fe'llow itizens, for they expose the whola business community to panic and. distress."
