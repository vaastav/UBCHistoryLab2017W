feftUp LAST EDITIG1 TUESDAY EVENING. TOPEKA, KANSAS. DECEMBER 17. 1901, TUESDAY EVENING.- TWO CENTS. CIQQT nPRflTF I Illy I uuuii J Li Philippine Tariff Starts Dis cussion in the House. Chairman Payne Explains Pur poses of the Bill. SENATE COMMITTEES. Assignments Are Made by a Special Committee. Burton Has Place on Public Land and Three Others. Washington, Dec. 17. The first debate of the session in the house began today on the bill to provide temporary reve nues for the Philippine islands. Under the agreement made last Friday the debate is continued today and tomorrow until 4 o'clock when the vote is to be taken. Mr. Payne, the floor leader of the majority, opened for his side and owing to the indisposition of Mr. Rich ardson the floor leader of the minority, who is suffering from an attack of the grip, the task of opening for the Dem ocratic side devolved upon Mr. Swan son (Va.). There was a fair attendance in the galleries. Before the debate be gan some preliminary business was transacted. Messrs. De Armond (Mo.) and Brossard (La.) who had not hereto fore appeared at this session, took the oath. After the routine business had been disposed of Mr. Payne moved that tne house go into committee of the whole for the Consideration of tne Philippine revenue bill. Two Democrats, Aiessrs. Vanderver (Mo.) and Cooper (Tex.) at tempted to interrupt the motion with requests for unanimous consent to con sider Schley resolutions, but Mr. Payne declined to yield the floor and his mo tion prevailed. Mr. Payne in opening the debate carefully explained the purpose of the bill which already has been set forth in his report. Mr. Payne reviewed at some length the events leading up to the formulation of the tariff. He contrasted the Spanisn rates with those fixed by the commis sion. On flour, for instance, he said, the rate had been reduced from. $1.88 to 50 cents, on rice from 52 to 40 cents, and on hams and smoked meats from $9.13 to Ji Proportionate reductions had been made on other articles. Mr. Payne explained that the com missi un also had deemed it wise to con tinue a portion of the old Spanish ex port tax on hemp, sugar and tobacco, owing to the difficulty of levying and collecting a land tax. Personally, he said, he did not like the idea of an ex port tax, but there seemed no other way at present. There was necessity for immediate action to meet the situation created by the decision of the supreme court. Mr. Payne also explained the feature of the bill providing for the extension of the navigation laws of the United States to the islands and the permission it granted to foreign vessels to ply be tween Philippine and American ports until January, 1905. Mr. Payne's statement that by that time it was hoped that American ships would be able to take care of this busi ness, aroused scattering applause on his side of the house. During Mr. Payne's speech there was quite a colloquy between Ml Gaines (Tenn.) -who visited the islands last summer and Mr. Payne. The latter de scribed the success of the Philippine commission and asserted that the Re publicans were trying to lift the Fili pinos to American citizenship. Mr. Gaines declared the constitution and flag should be carried to the Phil ippines. Mr. Payne said he was surprised that Mr. Gaines had not carried the flag and constitution to the islands. "Tou have done that covertly." said Mr. Gaines. "1 propose to show you up." Mr. Payne sarcastically replied that he supposed Mr. Gaines had learned in a brief visit more than all the officials of the United States in two years and half of investigation. Mr. Payne also had a brief contro versy with Mr. Wheeler (Ky.) in which the latter asserted that aggregate capi tal had the assurance that the attorney general would not prosecute the trusts and that was why they existed. Mr. Payne declared that Mr. Wheeler did not believe his own assertion any more than he (Payne) believed it. Mr. Payne closed his speech at 1:20 and was followed by Mr. Swanson (Va.) who declared that none of the benefits of the Filipino people spoken of could accrue through the agency of the pend ing bill. The voice of the floor leader of the majority, he said was the voice of Jacob but the. hand was the hand of Esau. Mr. Swanson said that the president and secretary of war favored making generous concessions to sugar and to bacco from Cuba, but this bill failed to make any concessions to the Philip pines. Reciprocity treaties pending in the senate allow concessions to foreign countries, but none to the Philippines, which we hold as a part of our country. Holding the Philippines by force weak ened Instead of strengthening this coun try. The money we now wasted in the Pnaippines would build up the largest navy in the world. The solution of the Philippine problem was a congressional declaration to give them independence as soon as a stable government could be formed. IX THE

Washington, Dec. 17.--Representative Wheeler of Kentucky has introduced a resolution to investigate the conduct of Rear Admiral Schley from the time he took command of the flying squadron up to and including the destruction of the Spanish fleet, July 3, 1898. It recites the action of the court of inauiry. and declares the American people desire an investigation by citizens not connected with the navy department. Representative Mudd of Maryland also introduced a resolution relative to Admiral Schley, as follows: "Resolved, That the thanks of con gress and of the American people are hereby tendered to Rear Admiral Win field Scott Schley and the officers and men under his command for their vic tory ovr the Spanish forces and the de struction of the Spanish fleet in the naval battle off Santiago de Cuba, July 3, 1898." Mr. Mudd says the resolution is not the result of my concerted action by the Maryland delegation, and represents his individual views. IV10RE ZERO WEATHER.

Packing House Interests Are Behind the Deal. WANT A NEW OUTLET. For Their Products In the Mis souri Valley. Export Shipments to Be Sent Orer Mew Line. Omaha, Dec. 17. Details of the or ganization of the new Omaha-Emporia road, mentioned in these dispatches yes terday, were made public today. R. M. Nevins, representing the packing house interests of St. Louis, is here negotiat ing the deal. Edward A. Cudahy, of the Cudahy Packing company, J. M. Wol worth, a local capitalist, and Wm. A. Paxton, for the Union Stock Yards com pany, have signed for blocks of stock in the projects! road and will probably be officers in the new company. Mr. Paxton went to Chicago today to con fer with the Armour Interests, which are also identified with the line. Mr. Nevins says the object of the new road is to furnish a southern outlet for the packing house products of the Missouri valley. With the Missouri, Kansas & Texas it will form an inde pendent line to the south, thus reliev ing the packing interests from the com bination rates on their products destined for export by way of an eastern sea board. It will also cut the mileage from 1,500 to 900 miles. 2000 HOMELESS. Great Damage and Suffering From Eastern Flood. Frank Daniels Opera Company Forced to Lose a Date. Philadelphia, Dec. 17. Railroad serv ice in this state, which was badly crip pled by the floods of Saturday night and Sunday, is gradually recovering its nor mal condition and by this afternoon or tomorrow morning trains will be run ning practically on time. Thousands of laborers are at work today repairing the damage to roadbeds and bridges, wrought by the rushing waters. The railroads that suffered the most are the Lehigh Valley, Central of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Lackawanna & Western and the New York Central. In some localities it will be weeks be fore the damage is fully repaired. The sweep of water was greater in some sections than was ever known be fore, and bridges that withstood the floods of years were swept away. The sudden drop in the temperature was providential in some respects, as it prevented the flood from spreading, but it entailed great suffering on the 2,000 or more persons rendered homeless by the destruction of their houses. AU pas sengers on stalled trained were removed from their uncomfortable situation last night and this morning by the railroad companies and the trains axe being ta ken to their destinations. The Frank Daniels comic opera com pany, which was to have opened a two weeks' engagement at the Broad the ater last night, did not reach the city until early this morning. Having been nearly 48 hours in making the journey from Buffalo, which is ordinarily ac complished in 22 hours. The members of thejcompany sat up nearly all of this time, and were both hungry and "tired when they arrived here. In the lower anthracite coal district the situation is growing worse. The mine workings are thoroughly soaked with water, and it may be weeks before some of them can be worked, although there was a resumption today in a few mines. It Is estimated that 50,000 mine workers and mechanics are idle as a re sult of the flood. At Harrisburg the Pennsylvania rail road officials say that trains from the west are now only about two hours late and from the north the service is prac tically regular. On the Lehigh Valley and New Jersey Central railroads, the service while somewhat improved, is still very irreg ular, and officials say they will be lucky if passenger traffic is fully resumed by the end of this week. Along the lines of both roads hundreds of cars loaded with coal are help up, but there is no danger of a coal famine as the companies have a large reserve supply at tidewater points. The Reading railway has been com pelled to suspend traffic on its Little Schuylkill branch between Port Clinton and Tamaqua because of numerous washouts and the loss of a bridge. It will require several days work to get the line in working order and mean while the company will be greatly ham pered in the handling of coal and freight trains. The weather today is not quite so cold as yesterday and in some sections scow is falling. Various estimates are given of the money loss entailed by the floods. Con servative guessers place the loss at from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000. So far re ports have beeen received here of the loss of nine lives in various parts of the state. Bordentown, N. J., Dec. 17. The freshet in the Delaware river here has fallen two feet and is gradually passing out. Traffic will probably be resumed today. Only two trains from Camden have reached Bordentown today. Wilkesbarre, Pa., Dec. 17. The -flood situation in the Wyoming valley shows some improvement today. The water In the Susquehanna river receded seven inches more during the night, but the lowlands are still submerged and ail connection between Wilkesbarre and the towns on the west side of the river is still cut off. The railroads are getting Into normal condition again. The first passenger train on the Lehigh Valley railroad from the east arrived shortly after midnight. It carried a number of belated pas sengers who had spent 48 hours in the cars in the flood district near Stony Creek. The first train bound east over the Lehigh Valley left this city at 7:4 this morning. The officials of the com pany announce that the road is in pretty good shape now, and that trains will soon be running on scheiule time. Between this city and Buffalo there is no trouble of any kind, but it will take 24 hours at least before the repairs ou the Lehigh division are completed. PITTSBURG'S LOSS A MILLION. Pittsburg, Dec. 17. The three rivers I at riLlayutii uttte iducti i.-? uun- Bfr tine ttitu lc o,k v,- ,-. ' the debris, mud and the reclaiming of lost craft, washed away by the waters has begun. The loss sustained by Pittsburg in terests may reach $1,000,000. The boards of health of the two cities are distrib uting disinfectants in the flooded dis tricts and this it is thought will reduce sickness to the minimum but it will take weeks for inundated houses to be dried out and made fit for occupancy. Coal shipments will be begun tomor row or Thursday but not much coal will be moved although there are over 15 million bushels awaiting shipment. The strike of the tow boat pilots has caused this fuel to be held at Pitts burg. TO SUE W.A.WHITE Piatt Says He Has Been Ma ligned by Magazine Article. St. Louis, Dec. 17. A special dispatch from Washington to the Republic says: "Senator Thomas C. Piatt said today that he had deck 01 to bring libel suits against Mr. William Allen White of Emporia, Kan., and McCiure's Maga zine. There can be no doubt of Sen ator Piatt's intention in the matter.and if the suit ever comes to trial it will be one' of the most interesting of its kind ever heard in the United States. "Mr. White is known as President 1 Roosevelt's biographer, and as one of i the final arbiters at the White House of all questions involving federal patronage in the state of Kansas. Mr. White is a gentleman with a fluent pen, who leaped into fame several years ago by writing an editorial in a country newspaper on "What's the Matter With Kansas?' "He h.as been lately giving attention to the politics of New York state, with special reference to its bearing on the future of President Roosevelt. He adores Roosevelt and he hates Piatt, and has shown this in two recent ar ticles in which he has lauded one and excoriated the other. 

UNPLEASANT PICTURE OF PLATT. "The latest article was published in McCiure's for the current month, and drew a picture of the senior senator from New York that was so unpleasant as to be a matter of regret even to some of the senator's enemies. It de picted Piatt as one of the wholly base, without a particle of patriotism or pub lic spirit, dragging down friends and foes alike to perpetuate his political power. It characterized him as a lobbyist and one whose life had been devoted to un wholesome burrowing and intrigue. Senator Piatt said today: SAYS HE WILL ENTER SUIT. "I have made up my mind to enter suit on account of the publication for which Mr. White is responsible. I never knew him and 1 am sure he does not know me. Yei he seems to have con ceived a deep dislike for me. There is malice in every line or his so-called bi ography. I do not object to his praising President Roosevelt, but 1-do object to his defaming me for the purpose of add ing to his praise. His article is made up of a tissue of lies, and all who know me know that it is made up of lies. I did not know until today that this Mr. White claims to be on terms of friendly intimacy with the president. I do not believe that the president would claim friendship with a man who would write about me as this man from Kansas has." "Have the papers in the suit been served yet?" "They will be served very soon. I in tend to have full satisfaction for this article, which was designed to make me appear as a contemptible object in the eyes of the world." 

WHITE SAYS NOTHING. Emporia, Dec. 17. Upon being ac quainted with the fact that Senator Piatt would bring a libel suit against him, W. A. White took the matter very complacently. Being asked what he had to say about the matter he said: "Not a thing." SMITH RESIGNS, Postmaster General to Be Suc ceeded by H. C. Payne. Washington, Dec. 17. Announcement was made today that Postmaster Gen eral Smith has tendered his resignation and that it has been accepted. Henry C. Payne, natioqal committeeman from Wisconsin, has been offered the position and has accepted it. 'S Witnesses Testify Concerning It in Court. Chicago, Dec. 17. Testimony was of fered before Judge Tulley today in the suit for the appointment of a receiver for John Alexander Dowie's Zion lace industries to show that Dowie posses sed some mysterious power over his disciples and that by means of it he induced them to obey his commands im plicitly. Samuel Stevenson, the plain tiff, who charges Dowie with having defrauded him of $185,000 by this power, went on the witness stand again at the opening session and swore that Dowie waved his hands and exerted this in fluence by pressing him closely to his body. The attorney for the defense tried to have this power appear in the records as magnetism, but the court would not permit it. Stevenson testi fied that three times he had felt an in describable awe when Dowie pressed him to his body and that from this in fluence he and other persons felt that Dowie could call down a curse upon him effectually. He related Dowie is said to have declared that if Dwight L. Moody did not cease his fight against Zion that he would not say that Moody might not die and that later Dowie told how Moody had sickened and died. Stevenson told how three times he had tried to get out from under Dowie's influence but had failed until now. During this testimony a dramatic re cital was made how Dowie had declared himself to be Elijah the Restorer, how at the "last day" he would be caught up in the clouds, and of the dark days to come for all outside Zion-. Temperatures of Large Cities. Chicago, Dec. 17. 7 a. m. tempera tures: New York 20; Boston 12; Phila delphia 22 Washington 18; Chicago 6; Minneapolis 2; Cincinnati 10; St. Louis 1& TAKES IIEW TURN Old Soldiers Take a Hand in Pension Office Fight. Ask President to Appoint One of Their Number. IS NOT YET SETTLED. Fight Is Assuming a Comedy Phase. Appointment Not Likely to Be Made Soon. The old soldiers and members of the G. A. R. in Kansas are today bombard ing Washington with telegrams asking that Cyrus Leland be reappointed to the Topeka- pension agency. Those who do not ask directly for Mr. Leland's re appointment ask that an old soldier be appointed. Hundreds of these telegrams are going to the president from all over the state. It has always been conceded by Re publicans that the pension agency is the patronage o the old soldiers. They are most deeply interested in it, and it has always been customary to appoint one of their number to the place. In the fight which Senator Burton and his fol lowers are making on Mr. Leland in behalf of Colonel Metcalf an attempt is being made to overturn this unwrit ten law. Colonel Metcalf served with distinction in the Spanish-American war, but he belongs to a younger gen eration from most of those who are in terested most vitally in pension affairs. Among the pensioners who are paid through the Topeka agency are 90,524 veterans of the civil war, and 510 sol diers of the Spanish-American war. The contest over the pension agency is becoming a great comedy. One day Senator Burton or some of his friends calls on President Roosevelt and the report is sent out that Colonel Metcalf is sure of the appointment. Immedi ately afterwards some of Mr. Leland's friends call on the president and are in formed that there has been no change in the situation. This morning it was the inning of the Burton people. The morning papers contained special tele grams In which Colonel Metcalf was ap pointed almost as positively as he was last Thursday. The night dispatches stated that Congressmen Long and Cal derhead called on the president and were told, in the presence of D. W. Mulvane, that Senator Burton's recom mendation would be followed. Today that report is denied. It is true that the two congressmen called on the pres ident and they asked that the appoint ment be delayed. .President Roosevelt assured them that he would wait, and no immediate appointment is therefore looked for. William Allen White, who stands close to the president, and who recently returned fron Washington, publishes two lines of comment on the situation in the Emporia Gazette of Monday, but they are Very striking. Here they are: "Still you know what Grimes said about Tracy." Lawrence people believe that the fight that is being made to land Colonel Met calf in Mr. Leland's place is for the purpose of diverting the fight on Lit Crum. A great fight is being made on Crum, whom Senator Burton is under stood to favor for United States mar shal. This is the place which most of Colonel Metcalf s friends would like to see him get, -as it is more in his' line than, the pension agency, and they as sert the -Burton people discovered that he might be appointed instead of Crum and immediately began plans to switch Metcalf to the pension agency. There is no doubt that the great ma jority of Kansas Republicans would be glad to see Colonel Metcalf made United States marshal and he is emin ently fitted for the place. The salary of the two- offices, is the same, $4,000 a year. The Lawrence World, published, in ColoneL Metcalf 's home town, says: "The position of pension agent at To peka is still hung up. While Lawrence would appreciate the appointment of its distinguished citizen at the same time the people of this vicinity realize that it is asking too much to ask President Roosevelt to disregard the known wish es of his predecessor after all that has been said. Gen. Metcalf ought to be appointed United States marshal and Mr. Leland ou"ht to be appointed pen sion agent at Topeka." In speaking of the position of Colonel Metcalf, C. S. Finch.-editor of the Law rence Journal, says: "The principal interest of Colonel Metcalf in an office is from a monetary standpoint. He does not care for an office for the honor there is in it. be cause he already has more honor than any appointment or state office could bring him. He would not care to be governor, because being colonel of the Twentieth Kansas is a far greater hon or than being governor, and it costs more to be governor than it comes to. Colonel Metcalf . probably wants some thing, but if so he will pick out an of fice that will pay well rather than one to -which there is a great amount of honor attached." The statement that the-president has been influenced by charges that Leland violated civil service rules is doubtless untrue, because these old charges were long ago disproved and have no stand ing before the president President Roosevelt naturally desires so far as possible to be in harmony with Senator Burton. The turning down of Tracey and Foley, whom the sen ator now knows should never have been recommended, makes the president nat urally anxious to now please Burton. The latter should see that he ought to defer to RooseVelt's emphatic promise to carry- out McKinley's known wishes in the pensio agency appointment, and bend his influence and energy to secure for -Metcalf the United States mar shalship. This would solve the problem and create harmony in big chunks. Burton ought to see that to urge his present position against the desires of both former and present presidents is not only the worst of taste, but bad policy for himself and his friends, when a happy solution is so apparently easy. Metcalf has been strongly endorsed by Burton. If his endorsements are "O. K.'d" for the marshalship, Metcalf will secure a place of especial fitness and of equal profit. This course would also enable Mr. Burton to be consistent with himself, in connection with the emphatic state ment he made in Topeka some weeks ago that the pension appointment was presidential patronage and he did n$ intend to press his personality. That position upon the part of the senator makes it apparent that some of Bur ton's followers, rather than he, are ac tively at work to bring about a change. 

WANTS TO HEAR FROM LOW. One of the dispatches from Washing ton published in a morning paper quotes the preBiaent ss oayiKs ihtt a ,i.an in whom he has the ufrcust confidence has useci in pretiJerl t t0 ' up Uzy pointment until he can con.municale with him. The dispatch further states that it is undei-stood that M. A. Low is the man referred to. .This is probably correct. It is claimed that Air. Low has openly stated to a number of people that Mr. Leland should be appointed, and in view of the recent reports sent out from Washing ton by the Burton people, it is quite probable that Mr. Low has asked the president to hold up the appointment until he has time to present a few facts to the president. The reports from Washington con cerning the interview between President Roosevelt and Congressmen Long and Calderhead do not agree. One report says that the president stated positively that he had decided to appoint Colonel Metcalf. Another report says that the president made no such positive state ment, but said he would follow Senator Burton's recommendation. Two of the reports agree that Lit Crum is in dan ger of losing the United States mar shalship. 

NOTHING TO SAY. G. M. Walden Adopts Wise Course Concerning Coburn. G. M. Walden, that Kansas City man through whom Secretary Coburn taught a few lessons to the people wiio' say bad things about Kansas unnecessarily, has discreetly concluded, after advising with his friends, to say nothing in re ply to Mr. Coburn. The Kansas City Star says: "Granville M. Walden, president of the- aKnsas City Live Stock exchange, has decided to preserve a dignified silence concerning the strictures made on his speech before the National Live Stock .convention in Chicago -by F. D. Ccburn, secretary of the state board of agriculture of Kansas. Mr. Walden's speech provoked a scathing letter from Mr. Coburn, wherein the latter took exception to Mr. Walden's picture of 'droughty Kansas. "Mr. Walden only returned to Kans&j City yesterday. He had no sooner land ed at the union depot than he was ap prised of the row he had stirred up. He went home and read the newspape s. "Mr. Walden was seen at his office In the Live Stock Exchange building this morning by a reporter for the Star. " 'I am. very busy today,' said Mr. Walden. 'A lot of business has accum ulated during my absence. 'Sou may say, however, that the convention at Chicago was a cracker-jack. But when it comes to taking care of a crowd Kansas City will give Cheago a few pointers when the nationp.i association meets in this city next j ear.' ' "What have you to sty concerning Mr. Coburn's criticism of your speech at Chicago?' queried th reporter. " 'It was great the way we worked to get the next meeting of the associa tion to come to Kansas City. It will brings 50,000 people here, and you'll see the greatest show ever - given on this earth.' " 'But what about Coburn?' persisted the reporter. " 'I don't know. You see I am so busy. Come around tomorrow. I don't believe that J'll pay any attention to what Coburn iiad to say. I am a busy man and haven't time to give a man who is trying to get a lot of free adver tising to boom his candidacy for gov ernor of Kansas. Really, you will have to excuse me from talking about the matter at all.' "Upon his arrival at the stock yards this morning Mr. Walden consulted one or two friends as to what course he should pursue in replying to Mr. Co burn's communication. They advised him to ret Mr. Coburn and his supply of invective alone." Mr. Walden's reference to Secretary Coburn as a man who is after "free ad vertising" is very amusing to people who know Mr. Coburn. To no man in Kansas, except Rev. Charles M. Shel don, is persjnal notoriety so distasteful as to Secretary Coburn". As to any as pirations he has to be governor, his at titude on that subject is best illustrated by a recent conversation between Mr. Coburn and Capt. John Seaton in the presence of a newspaper man. In 1898 Mr. Coburn was a real, bona fide can didate for governor. He did not make a light for the nomination, but he let his friends boom him, and would have taken it had the nomination been given him. Captain Seaton was aisa one of the seven candidates before the Hutchinson convention. They talked it over for the first time a few days ago. "I was really sorry for the other fel lows who got left," said Mr. Coburn, "but so far as I am personally con cerned I am profoundly grateful for the manner in which that little contest came out. I am very glad now that it ended as it did. I am convinced that I am fitted for the line of work in which I am now engaged more so than any other." 

BURNED HER TO DEATH Horrible Treatment of a Child by a Colored Boy. Athens, Ga., Dec. 17. Leila Lambert, an 8-year-old" child, was burned to death In her home last night by an un known young negro boy, whom she had allowed in the house during the absence of her parents. The boy was peddling, and asked that he could warm by a fire in the Lambert house.
