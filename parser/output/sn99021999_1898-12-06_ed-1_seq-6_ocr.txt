N. P. FEIL. Notary Public. Itcnd the president's message. It will well repay reading. The president's message Is in and It Is DOW up to tlic governors of the various states , whose effusions will be due next mouth. President MvKlnley has taken con gress and the public Into his confidence. President and congress must now share responsibility. Every Intelligent citizen who wants to be Informed of the condition of the country and the work , of the govern ment should read the full text of the president's message. The men who have been putting in their spare time lately guessing what the president was going to say in his message can now turn their attention to predicting what congress will do. There Is nothing Blow about Iowa. Speaker Rcod bad scarcely rapped for order when Representative Cousins caught the presiding'officer's eye and succeeded In getting la the first bill of the session. - A medical journal discusses at length the question , "When to Eat Dinner. " The subject Is pertinent now , but be fore republican prosperity set in it was rot nearly so pressing a question as how to get the dinner. Congressman Ilalloy will now have an opportunity to demonstrate his fitness to retain the leadership of the minority in congress. Speaker Itccd Is nt the old etnnd , ready to give the Teiau all the practice he desires. President McKlnlcy forgot to take up the question of an annexation treaty between Omaha and South Omaha , but there Is no question ho would favor it If it were Included in the treaty-mak ing power vested in him. An Iowa husband , who ran away from his family three years ago , after passing through the Santiago campaign mustered up enough courage to return home. Who says the war has worked no benefit for this country ? Providence appears to be keeping up Its watchful care over the west While this section only goto a little snow- etorin , which is an added promise of n bountiful crop uext year , the east Is overwhelmed with blizzards , destruc tive to life and property. The best evidence of the opinion of outsiders as to whether the exposition was n. good thing fqr this section of country la the unanimity with which almost every other portion of the coun try. Is discussing the holding of an ex position of Its own. It Is d poor state which has not sonic project of this klm In prospective. If the * journals which are pressing the administration and the peace commls eloncrs to ' hurry , up with their work would only cease for a few days the circulation of alarmist rumors concern Ing the progress of the negotiations the commissioners might duvote constdcra ble time to their task now occupied In denying these storlcu.

THE 

PREHIDKNTS MESSAGE. The annual message of president Me- Ilnloy Is an Interesting and Instructive document , but the omission of any refer- nee to the policy of the government re garding new possessions U disappoint- ng. It Was expected that the president vould devote some' consideration to his supremely Important matter , which s commanding more of the attention of ho nation than any other subject , by vay of explaining and Justifying ter- Itorlal expansion ami outlining the lollcy which In the judgment of the ex- cutlve should be adopted in respect to his now territory. President McKln- cy has been giving this whole matter arcf ul thought and all the people those vlio are opposed to expansion equally vlth those who are In favor of It were inxlous to learn his views. It secmn , lowevcr , that ho did not consider It ipproprlntc to discuss the subject pond- ng the signing of the treaty of peace , rom 'which it Is to bo Inferred that \ hen that shall have been done he may wnmunlcfite to congress his views as to he government of the new possessions. There is one Important statement in his connection , which is that the pledge of the United States In regard o Cuban independence must be faith- ully carried out This feature of the message -will tend to discourage the fforts of1 the unncxntlonlsts In Cuba and the United States , while It will re assure the Cuban people who want self-government and will exert an In fluence favorable to the pacification of : ho Island. Whatever doubt or mis firing the Cubans have as to the In- entlon of the United States to deal vlth them according to Its promise should bo dispelled by the unequivocal assurance of President McKInley that as soon as Cuba is pacified its' people will be aided to form a government for hcmselves. Passing over ; as not inviting special rommcnt , the statement of bur foreign relations , the reference to proposed cur- cncy legislation Is as Important as any natter contained In the message. It vill be hC'C'ii from this that President McKInley has not Joined the extreme currency reformers and Is not pre wired to destroy the greenbacks and give to the banks a monopoly of the pa- ) er money of the country. He holds he same position on this question that 10 held a year ago , when he recom- nended that United States notes re deemed in gold ehould only be paid out again In exchange for gold. This s a very different process from that proposed by the currency reformers , vlilcli contemplates the destruction of he greenbacks , their place to be taken > y national banknotes. _ It Is proba- > Ie that the reformers 'will not find nucli encouragement In the president's position , although he is evidently in 'avor ' of early legislation to remedy dc- 'ects In the currency system which everybody recognizes. President McKInley says the con struction of the Nlcaraguan canal is tow more than ever Indispensable and t Is very plainly Indicated' that trie influence of the administration will be given in behalf of the proposed legls- atlon , which It now appears probable will be enacted at the present session. The importance of legislation for the permanent Increase of the army is urged and the president states that it s his intention to muster out the en tire volunteer army as soon as provi sion is made for the increase of the regular establishment This will be gratifying to the volunteers and will operate to enlist the active efforts of their friends in behalf of the legislation asked for. The message is long , necessarily made so by a narration of the events con nected with the war , but It will well repay the careful perusal of the citi zen who .desires accurate Information regarding the Interesting and Impor tant matters of which It treats. AS TO 

ASSESSMENT UNDERVALUATION. FREMONT. Neb. , Dec. 1. To the Editor of The Bee : In your Issue of yesterday I notice an editorial upon the evil of under valuation In taxation , or rather la assess ment tor taxation. Being In sympathy with your efforts In that direction , I now Intrude with the following upon you to call your attention to a particular part of the taxing system. With respect to valuation of property for taxation our system Is the same aa that of other states in the essential feature , to- wlt : That by the decisions of our courts all over the United States the question of value Is made a judicial question , and the assessor In deciding that la considered as a ludge upon the bench and his fixing of the value as a judgment of a court. From this It follows that what value he fixes stands whether right or wrong and cannot be questioned. The only relict provided Is not for public good , but simply for the benefit of a property owner who thinks he has been assessed out of proportion to some one else and that Is made to the equalization board ; It 1s not a complaint against valua tion fixed as a fact , but more properly simply as to the apportionment of it be tween the different property holders. The value aa a matter of fact Is left to the con science of the assessor and no one can re view his findings. This Is the weak spot. It the statute worn eo amended that It should provide "that the valuation fixed by the assessor shall not be conclusive , but that on complaint of any one Interested In taxation the > court or come certain board shall proceed and hear the question and shall place it at the market value as the same mar be proved by compe tent evidence of witnesses" and allow an appeal In case the court or board disregards evidence , the true valuation could then ; be enforced , because under such a law the valuation fixed by the assessor would nol then be a final judgment and would not stop the way. As It 1s now the assessors meet and agree to assess property at one- fifth or one-sixth ( this Is done In my county and others ) , and they then go out and eo undervalue , yet were you to go Into court to mandamus them to comply and show up against them this agreement for undervalua tion you could get no relief , as the corrup tion of a judge does not affect the validity of the judgment he renders , and so the courts hold with respect to the assessor under the laws aa they now are. Any lawyer who has had occasion to examine the subjec will substantiate this. The reason that In the eastern elates a better valuation is returned Is simply on account of public sentiment and the better conscience of the assessors. You can see how under our valuation system so heJge < In by judicial decisions that the commani of the statute to assess at true or actua market value in practice becomes nugrtory and the assessor can violate It with 1m punlty. If the bar were removed o tna upon complaint the assessor * ' standing would not have the force of a judgment , then the tatute for actual valuation could be en- orced. D. K. The author of this letter points out clearly one of the noticeable defects of our present system of taxation and suggests a partial remedy. While It Is rue the existing system of equalization boards only coutilbutcs to heighten the 'arce set In "motion by the assessors , It 8 questionable whether the mere em- towering of the equalization boards to ncrease or decrease the total valuation would satisfy the demand for revenue aw revision. It must be admitted that this plan : rlcd In other states has resulted In some Improvement It has also been > ut Into effect within certain limits In ho Omaha charter , which establishes a board of review intermediary between he tax commissioner and the board of equalization , which board of review is mdcr no obligations to offset the re duction of assessment on a piece of iroperty by raising the assessment of other property. The board of review , however , like the board of equalization , receives many complaints of overval uation , but few complaints of underval uation. With no one charged with the July of exposing the work" of negligent or corrupt assessors , the tendency to constant and systematic undervalua- lens may be checked , but not repressed. The surest way to secure honest and equal assessment of property Is the plan suggested by The Bee to make certain valuations made for other purposes the rnsls for the tax assessment. If the assessors were by law forbidden to list real estate nt less than what It has been sold for or mortgaged for or appraised n probate court within the year , or to overlook personal property readily as sessable in the ehape of bank deposits and securities for loans , the foundation would be laid for more accurate valua- lens of all property. As long , however , as the assessors arc allowed deliber ately to Ignore unmistakable evidences of property values , the evils of under valuation and consequent unjust In equality of taxation cannot be avoided. 

RECIPROCITY A'EOOTIATIONS. It appears that some progress is being made with negotiations under the reel- H'ocity provisions of the tariff law. i'ho commercial arrangement made vlth France under section 3 of the law s said to have good results for the trade of both countries , though the ar rangement Is of limited scope. Nego tiations for a more comprehensive ar rangement , under section 4 of the net , ire pending. The president also states that negotiations with other govern ments , In part Interrupted by the war , are In progress under both sections of the tariff act , with favorable promise of satisfactory results. What effect the larger commercial relations upon which the United States s entering will have upon the reci procity provisions of the tariff Is un certain , but it seems not improbable that it will strengthen them in the consideration of other countries , since , the broadening of bur commercial ri valry may lead other commercial na tions to seek more of the American market. Much may depend , however , upon the effect which , these enlarged relations shall have on our tariff sys tem. It Is the expectation of the free traders that they will bring about the overthrow of protection and there Is no doubt that they hold out this menace. Meanwhile there Is some gratification to be had from the fact that the reci procity provisions of the tariff law have not wholly failed , as the oppo nents of the law predicted they would. 

MORE DISCRIMINATION THREATENED. More discrimination against Amer ican products by Germany Is threat ened , but In view of the fact that the clement which favors tills policy Is said to be not entirely harmonious It may not bo able to carry out its plan. Still we may expect no modification of existing discrimination as to our meat products , notwithstanding the fact , well attested , that there Is no ground for the claim that American meats are dis eased. There is German testimony for this. The American consul at Cologne recently sent to the State department the substance of a German official re port on trichina Investigation.- . This showed tliat all the cases of trichinosis during fifteen years were traced to European pork , not a single case of dis ease being traced to tbo use of Amer ican salted , pickled or canned meat , or of smoked sausage Imported under de cree of September 3 , 1801. The con sul stated that an association of im porters has offered all over Germany u reward of a thousand marks for a case of trichinosis due to American salt or pickled pork or smoked sausage Imported under the decree * of 1801 and the reward has not yet been claimed. It la said that American pork Is much more rigidly inspected in Germany than the domestic product. The German Inspectors specters take'five times as many pieces from each carcass for microscopic ex amination. The consul anticipates that the present methods of Inspection will prevent the Importation of sausage and pickled pork and bonelew hams. Ger man officials resort to still other de vices to keep out our meats. There seems to be no proiulso of an abandonment or even modification of this unfair and unwarranted treatment of American meats , if indeed It Is'uot made more rigorous. The representa tions of our government as to the in justice of the discrimination have been futile , while at the same time hostility to our products in Germany seems to be * growing. It Is a situation that makes a strong appeal for nu applica tion of the law of retaliation. By the little exemption Joker which they bad Inserted into the Omaha char tcr by the last legislature the railroads saved themselves over $5,000 in taxes each year at the expense of the city treasury and the other taxpayers. Un der such circumstances whut right have they to haggle over the payment of via duct charges which are properly charge able to them and which should have , been paid long ago ? The fusloulst press of the state gen erally attributes the disaster to til rlune tickets to mistakes and failure o make peed party pledges on the part jf the state officers and the last legla- aturc. The republicans will not be re- ponslble for the state oillcers during he coming two years , but If the rcpub- lean legislature lives up to party pledges and makes n record for economy and iseful legislation , accompanied with casonablo dispatch In doing Its work , t will Ue n powerful leverage to get the est of the state government next time. M. Cnnibon. the French ambassador 0 Washington , has not been In this country very long mid he has evidently used his powers of observation to good advantage since coming to this side of he Atlantic , a Ills observations of American character , both the native and orelgn-bbrn , might bo .studied wfth profit not only by his own government nit by others. Such a clear conception if existing conditions would save many 1 blunder and decrease the danger of icrlous differences of an International character.

The fact that the old admiral went o courageously to what he regarded as cer- aln doom lifts him high above his fellow ifflcera and , In a true sense , leaves him a heroic figure In the history of the period. 

LOGIC OP EXPANSION. Government-of Unit nil a Precedent for the Philippine * . Now York World. It Is announce * ! that the Hawaiian com mission will report In favor of estab- Ishlng a territorial form of government for he Island * , -with , a delegate. In congress , a oca I legislature and other features of terri- orlal organization such as have pertained o those In the United States. " According to the census of 1890 the popu- atlon of Hawaii was about 90,000. Of there , n round numbers , 34,000 were natives , 6,000 lalf castes , 7,500 born in Hawaii of foreign mrents , 15,000 Chinese , 12,000 Japanese , 3,600 .Portuguese , 1,900 . Americans , 1,300 British , 1,000 Germans , 600 Polynesians and ,000 other foreigners. And this hybrid aggregation , with fewer Americans than enough to constitute a school district In this city , is to have a delegate In congress , and In due time two senators and a representative , with three Sectoral votes. This Is the inescapable logic of annexa- lon. Already one senator Gear of Iowa- has expressed himself'in favor of Filipino representation in congress. It Is as foolish & nations as in individuals to shut their eyes to the consequences of their acts. 

MONEY SEEKING INVESTMENT. Sure and Gratifying Symptom * of Financial Health. New York Times. The bond dealings on the Stock exchange during the month of November , amounting o 1105,000,000 , the largest monthly total on record ; are a highly significant sign of the Imes.This great volume of bond sales , which Includes only railroad and miscella neous bonds , government and state bonds reaching a total of over { 3,000,000 more , re- lects a great and growing movement for the nvestment of capital. The November buy- ng was more than ttireo times the total1 of the same month a year ago , and the' total 'or the eleven months of the year 1898 is (765,000,000 ( , an Increase of $283,467,760 over tbo same months In 1S97. The bond market , which Is now not only active but broad , Is a sure indication of cound business conditions and public confi dence. A year or fwo ago capital sought only gilt-edged" Investments. .As the "gilt- edged" securities rose In price until the In terest .return . approached 2 per cent men. began to look through the general list and' pick out here ou.d there a bond of not quite so high a price. As confidence returned more and more bonds from the general list Found a market and the buying broadened. Then , as prices advanced , early buyers found It profitable to sell out and buy still other Units , which In their turn would be disposed of at a profit. This explains the Immense November transactions , which have so 'far exceeded tbo simitar movement a year ago. It Is a sure and gratifying symptom of financial health. Money Is seeking Investment. It Is at work earning more , money. The loan account of the banks , although of late somewhat sophisticated by exchange operations duo to the loaning of New York money In London , baa reached a volume that reflects active 'business and a condition of prosperity. But we have gone a step beyond bond Investment - , vestment and stock speculation. The almost dally organization of new companies with large capital shows that we have now reached the ftago where money can be had for new enterprises. That Is the final stage of recovery ( rom business depression. It U not merely a portent of prosperity , U 1s prosperity. The American people are aitlr. A11VICU TO TIIK LEU 191 , ATI ) RE. Fremont Tribune : If any good reason can bo shown why the oil Inspection law should bo kept on > the books It will probably be kept there by the next legislature. Other- wlso It will have to go.

Has It reduced the number of accidents caused by poor oil 7 Mlndcn Gazette : It the republican legis lature will meet , elect a United States sen ator , make the necessary appropriations to decently run state Institutions , lop off sorno of the leeches which have boon fattening from the state house , amend the ballot Uw , then go home , the people will not regret their choice of those who have been elected aa senators and representatives. Otherwise a roar Is liable to be heard. Blair Pilot : The state legislature has It in ita power this winter to greatly reduce ex penditures. There are n number of "extra clerks" employed which come under the head of "padded pay roll , " and then there are a number of $6,000 men drawing from $12,000 to $18,000 from the state yearly. Pay the $600 clerk $600 and pay the $600 stenogra pher $600 , and employ only a sufficient num ber of clerks to do the work and great shall bo your reward from tbo voters. Plattsmouth Post : Republicans have the opportunity to compel the respect of all par ties , regardless of politics , this winter by honest and above board legislation , and there Isn't an honest republican In the state of Nebraska 'but ' expects just such true methods from the men whom the people have elected to represent them. The state needs no moro so-called reformers , but straightforward men in the state 'house and then there will be nothing to reform. Ord Quiz : There will be a lot of fellows wanting snaps from the coming legislature. Dear republican legislators , don't do as the poputlsts have been doing. Make as few ap- polnUnents as possible. Don't place anyone on the payroll who la not worthy and whose services are not needed. Do the work you have to do as you would if the losses were to be borne by you personally. If you will do BO there will be no more danger of popu- flst rule in Nebraska. If you do otherwise the day of reckoning wlir come for the party. York Times : When the members of the legislature gather in Lincoln at.tho opening of the session the people of the capltaf city will-be considerably surprised at the feeling and determination of the republican mem bers. They know that a vast responsibility is resting upon them and they are deter mined not to betray their trust in any way. Those sordid schemers at the state capital who think money and railroad passes are omnipotent will surely find a different class of men to deal with from what they expect. After manipulating populists at their will many of them have come to believe that all men are as sordid as they. A surprise of considerable magnitude is In store for them. Superior Journal : One of the very first things the Nebraska legislature should do on assembling is to wlpo out the present law wlch provides a premium on Ignorant voters by the circle at the head of the ballot and 'the substitution of the old form of ballot. In this state , with the least per cent of illiteracy In the United States , the voter who cannot read his ballot through from top to bottom and place his cross after the name of the man of his choice , hardly deserves to have the privilege of voting. At least ho should be ready and determined to learn ae speedily as possible , and the best way is to return to the style In vogue before the populists began to mutilate U In hopes to gain votes thereby. Pawnee Republican : The republican party of Nebraska looks to the legislature this winter to perform much needed legislation that will inure , not only to ( ho benefit of thV party' butlto the general'welfare ot the entire state. The alleged party of reform had a golden opportunity two years ago to benefit the state in many ways , but 'the cor morants of that party would have none of it. The republican party of Nebraska de mands of the legislature this coming winter , that they use the strictest economy in the expenditure of the money of the taxpayers of the state. The secretaries of the State Board of Transportation are a useless luxury , as well as is the chief oil Inspector and his deputies. The people are dead against both of these adjuncts for place hunters. The strictest scrutiny should bo made into all the expenditures of the populists In the car * and maintenance of our public institutions. Where there can be found a supernumerary In any of these institutions cut him off in- stanter. Let economy be the watchword In all the branches of the state government and the people will say at the end of the session , "Well done , good and faithful serv ants. " Hastings Record : Pursuing the same pol icy that enabled the party to elect them the republicans who will occupy seats In the- twenty-sixth legislative assembly at Lincoln this winter will hold themselves aloof from the members of the "third house , " the cau cuses and the "oil room" which will be in operation for a certain senatorial candidate who does not represent the party or the choice of the people of this state. It is a matter of regret that men should thus bo forewarned of an Inevitable truth. Tht > choice of the people demands that some con sideration be paid to their candidate. The success of the republican party demands it , and the success of the local candidate rests largely upon the selection of a United States senator. Perfect vigilance on the part of the members-elect must be exercised at all times for the good of themselves and the good of the voters who made it possible for them to hold their several very Important posi tions. Public sentiment demands the elec tion of a clean and capable man who Is known to all the people and public sentiment seems to be very one-sided In this Important matter. Kearney Hub : The first duty of the Ne braska legislature , when It convenes in January , is to repeal the law creating the present state railroad commission , which Is a commission merely in name and not in the least in fact. Many years ago , when It had been demonstrated that the railroad commissioners of Iowa , Missouri and other states could handle the railroad question and reduce rates , it was thought advisable to try the experiment In this state. The constitution forbid' the creation of more elective ofljces , fee It was evaded by the passage of a law authorizing the appoint ment by the state officers of three secre taries , to themselves , -whose dutlea should be to regulate rates and perform such other acts as properly devolve upon a body of that character. The law was a failure from the start. The secretary thus appointed , and not elected by the people , acknowledged no allegiance to the people , or more properly to public sentlme-nt and recognized no obli gation except to the appointing power. So , dividing the responsibility between the ap pointive power and the power appointed or rather shifting the responsibility from one to the other , nothing of value has ever been accomplished , either under a republi can or populist administration. Now It Is time to end this farce , to repeal this law , to cut off these supernumeraries , and save the money expended to the people who have formerly paid It. Thcro arc other reforms along this line that demand attention , but this ono stands first and foremost and should bo disposed of speedily without wincing or flinching. 

I-AM1MAHIC VANISHING. Philadelphia Ledger : There Is one other profoundly cherished thing with which we are likely to part , to-wlt : The principle of protection of American Industries of domestic capital and labor. , The Homo Market club , the strongest organization of protectionists In the country , Is vigorously , angrily antagonizing our new policy of "Im perialism" upon this ground alone. All things considered , wo are likely to pay an exceedingly high price for It. St. Louis Republic : Agulnoldo and his lieutenants have the Itch for office and power. The Indications are that considera ble moral suasion , perhaps physical force , will have to bo used to change their at titude from hostility to acquiescence. The aspect of 'things ' In Iho Philippines is far from reassuring. But it la not sufficiently grave to remove the presumption that Ad miral Dewey and General Otis are able and willing to meet the difficulties that may nrlso In a prompt , effective and quieting fashion. Philadelphia Record : The cost of maintaining the army during the war and for the future , as outlined In the official figures and estimates , furnishes some In teresting data for the taxpayer's considera tion. During the government year ended June 30 last the War department expended $62,634,784 ; the estimates for the year be ginning July 1 next amount to $195,250,377. For the first six months of next year the department will require $60,177,539 , making a total of $255,427,917 for military expenses during eighteen months commencing January 1 next. Imperialism Is a costly thing , even in a tlmo of profound peace. Detroit Free Press : The recommenda tions of the secretary of war will remind the American people that the country that dances to expansion music must pay the fiddler. A standing army of 100,000 , an ac- vance of 50 per cent for officers on duty In our island possessions , twenty moro cadets at West Point , $30 for apprehending a de serter Instead of $10 , the stocking of our arsenals with 500,000 Krag-Jorgcnsens these nro some of the items that will im press our peace loving nation with the necessity of overcoming .Its abhorrence ot progressive armament Pand of being pre pared for an Increasing militarism with Us attendant financial burdens and its ever- present and repelluut suggestion ot armed authority. 

PERSONAL AND OTHERWISE. One of the unexpected resufts of tlto war Is that it has set the American people to study ing their constitution. Our mutual Undo Samuel got nearly thir ty-six and a quarter millions out of the to bacco tax. The man who uses tobacco Is of use to his country. Speaker Reed's latest remark traveling In the newspapers Is to the effect that some folks "seem to think that wo can furnish canned freedom for all the heathen. " Governor Wells of Utah Is particularly fond of oysters , ono ot the few things hard to get In that state. Consequently a barrel of the bivalves Is shipped him every week from Baltimore. In spite of the war risk premiums , which were practically a bonus , the marine insur ance companies are not likely to come out much ahead after the damages wrought by the recent storm. , Shakespeare is authority for the statement that "fair Is foul and foul Is fair , " so It Is not more remarkable that Congressman White Is a black man , than that Governor Black of/ New York Is a white man. Senator Morrlll , though he has had M. A and LL. D. degrees conferred on him from the Universities of Pennsylvania and Ver mont , spent all his early life on his father's farm and was educated only at the roadside country schools. Captain Slgsbee is tuman , llko the rest of us. In his article in which he tells what bo was doing just before the destruction of tbo Maine , ho says : "I then wrote a letter home , in which I struggled to apologize for having carried in my pocket for ten months a letter to my wife from one of her friends of long standing. " Frederick Remington makes a stagger at Irish dialect in his latest story , ot which this is a sample brick : "An * the lolkes nv this t'lng do be groan' an , an' Is rayported down en the Parlamlnt , they'll be havin' a law far It more's the nadc. " Remington neglects to explain that the Irishman who could > mangle United States In that way has not yet been born. Previous to placing a young woman on trial for blackmail in New York the fair defendant was made to retire to a far corner of the room at the Instance of the district attorney , who feared the In fluence of her hypnotic eyes on the susceptible jurymen. This IB a novel factor in Criminal trials , but novelties in New York justice are not unusual. General Wood has granted the petition of several Spanish merchants for permission to close their stores on Sunday , which , under the Spanish law , they were compelled to keep open. Ho has also issued a special order directing the saloons to be closed that day and there is not likely to be a "Sunday closing" question in Santiago as long as It has a military governor. At the examination of jurymen for the trial in New York ot Mrs. William A. B. Moore , charged , with her husband , of a "badger" game of blackmailing , the prose cuting attorney insisted that the beautiful young woman should not sit with her coun sel , but in a remote corner of the room. He refused to state his reasons for this demand In court , though ho won his point , but after ward to newspaper reporters he said he was afraid ot Mrs. Moore's powers of hypno tism on the men who were to try her. MIND YOUR OWN IIUSINESS. A Splendid Prescription for 8uccc in Life. J , Sterling Morton's Conservative. Now that the election has passed and the short days and the long nights of winter are with us , it is a good time for farmers , mer chants , mechanics , millers , manufacturers and railroad men to do a little practical thinking. After due reflection and a gen eral review of economic and industrial con ditions by all classes tbo old maxim , "Mind your own business , " will loom up as a splen. did prescription for success in lite. Tbo farmers who farm , who study agri culture , who personally look after plowing , planting and cultivating their fields and wno take judicious and Intelligent care of their live stock and with persistent and well di rected Industry keep their buildings In good repair are "minding their own business. " And as a rule they are successful , satisfied aud contented. The merchants who have studied markets , selected goods suitable < to the tastes , pur poses and purses of their customers , and with integrity and politeness served the ROYAL POWDER BAKING Makes the food more delicious and wholesome . . . ovu mma > owci eo. mw voiu. trading public without denouncing any and all citizens who may have differed from them cither religiously , politically or In ny other way , have generally achieved gratifying re sults. They have minded their own business. The mechanics who have stuck Industrt- ously and Intelligently to their vocations , not squandered their time In debating monetary vagaries have , by minding their own busi ness , pretty generally acquired affair com pensation , And the millers and manufacturers ho have depended self-rellantly upon themsejves and not upon enactments for profitable opera tions of their concerns have nothing to cpm- plaln about. The railroad men who have attended strictly to railroads and not to the business of common councils , state legislatures and , congress , seem eminently Illustrative of the value of minding one's own business. And now at the close of A year upon tno threshold of a new era In American affairs it is Intensely useful that all men , women and children now solemnly resolve to mind tholr own business for at least the remainder of this century. Thus legislators may make laws and lobby ists let them alone. Thus farmers may in dividualize themselves and use plows and harness and planting machines Instead of preambles and resolutions by gregarious granges. So railroads may cease crowding with their emissaries the corridors of state capltols and the recesses of the national statute Incubator at Washington. And If alt classes ot Americans wilt etudy their own business and attend to their own business during the year 1899 prosperity will' perpetuate Itself. 1IHEEZY TRIFLES.
