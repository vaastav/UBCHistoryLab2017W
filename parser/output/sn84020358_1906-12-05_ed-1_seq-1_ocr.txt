The prevailing tone of the comment is favorable, particularly with reference to the nresi'i lent's fnte- ments on the Japanese question, the newspapers empnasizlng the president's warning of a possible use of the feder al forces for the protection of the Jan anese. This feature of the message has given especial satisfaction In official Japanese quarters, where it, is pointed out that Japan is satisfied to await the outcome of the issue between the state and federal authorities. The Daily Telegraph says the presi dont speaks out resolutely and fear- lesesly, knowing that the democracy likes a man who is not afraid to be its master. The Standard says that the most slg niflcant feature of the message is that the president is constantly finding him self "up against" the American consti tution. Far sighted observers have long slnce seen that the United States has outgrown its cradle, yet the conserva- tlve sentiment of th t nnn,uiin J people on earth clusters strongly around the Constitution.

South wick, of Cornwall, who is stopping at the Grand Union hotel. It was not until several hours after me fiageoy mat tne death was report- fd to the police. The Information they received was meagre. For nearly half an hour the ferry boat circled the spot where the woman sank, but no trace of the body was discovered. So far as the police can 1' arn, Mr. Southwick and his sister-in-law, Miss Miner, had been.at Washing ton to attend the opening session of congress. They had reached Jersey City on the Pennsylvania railroad and shortly before 3 o'clock started for Manhattan on the ferryboat. They went to the upper deck and stood out si(ie they being among the few who dared the cold wind. When the boat reached about mid stream Mr. Southwick left his sister-in-law in order to get a good view of a passing tow. He had left Miss Miner alone at the stern'of the boat. Soon afterwards two men going on deck saw something black go over the side. Run ning to the' rail they saw a woman in the water and gave the alarm. The woman was not seen again. Near where she had stood on the deck a muff and pocketbook were picked up and later Identified as Miss Miner's by South wick. , Mr. Southwick stated that he did not believe that his sister-in-law had com mitted suicide, as she was in the best of health and had no troubles. He said that he believed that a lurch of the boat had thrown'her overboard. He said that they had intended to go di rect to their home in Connecticut. Southwick to-night refused to. dis cuss the drowning, saying that the case was in the hands of the police. MOST INUENlOUSi Y ORGANIZED Continental Wall Paper Company De nounced In Court as Trust.

The Copper Queen hotel is said to have been swept away bv the flood and at least fifty persons lost their lives. The concentrator dam, which gave way, precipitating the great flood upon the town, was construited entirely of earth. The dam was carried away two years ago as the result of swollen streams, and a number of persons were drowned. A message received here to-night from Tucson, Arizona, says that Clif ton is half destroyed. The report that scores of persons were drowned is par tially confirmed. HIREE HOTELS DESTROYED.
