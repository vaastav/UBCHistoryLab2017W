w BY TELEGRAPH PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. JFeUo w- Citizens of the Senate and House of MtpreaenkUiimr Another ye^r of health and of ly abundant harvests has passed. For these, and espeoialjhr for the ttHimpared condition of our National affair#,-our Re newed and profound gratitude to Ood is -^due. We remain in peace- and friendship "with foreign powers. CiC-Unitedetiorts vf, The of disloyal bitizens of the States to involve us in foreign wars A aid in inexcusable insurrection,have been unavailing. Her Britanic Majesty's Gpv 1' £l«rnment, as was justly expected, have ex '-T«rdsed their authority to prevent the de w. parture of new hostile expeditions from 'British ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly in dicated the neutrality which he proclaim ed at the beginning of the contest. Quea tions of great interest and importance have •arisen out of the blockade and other bel« ligerent operations between the Govern Oiii ment and several of the maratime powers, but have been discussed so far as was pos V.''sible, in a spirit of frankness, justice and .% mutual good will. It is especially gratify ing that our prize courts, by the imparti- 1 «lity of their adjudication, have command ed the respect.and confidence of Maratime Powers. y The supplementary treaty between the U. 

MIMI Great Britain for the sup­ pression ol the African Slave trade, made I on the 17th day of February last, has been *. duly ratified and carried into execution.— It is believed that so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inhuman and barbarous traffic has been brought to an end. I shall submit for the v consideration of the Senate a convention for the adjustment of possessary claims in .Washington Territory, arising out of the treaty ol the 15th of June, 1846, between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source of some dis quiet among the citizens of that now rapid ly improving part of the country. A novel and important question involv ing toe extent of the maratime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the Island of Cuba has been debated without reaching an agreement and it is propesd in au amicable spirit to refer it to the arbi trament of a friendly power. A conven tion for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought it a proper subject to the approval of tho Senate, to concur with the interested commercial powers, in an ar rangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt duos, upon the principles which have heretofore been adopted, in regard to the imposts upon navigation in tho waters of Denmark. The King, pending the con troversy between this Government and that of Chili, touching the seizures at Sil lan, in Peru, by Chillian officers, of a large amount of treasure belonging to citizens of the United States, has been brought to a close by order of his Majesty, the King of Belgium, to whose arbitration the question was referred. The question was thorough ly and patiently examined by that just and respected magistrate. Although the sura awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they expected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his Majesty's decision, which was promptly complied with by Chili, when intelligence in regard to it reached tin's country. The joint Commission, under the act of the last session, lor carrying into effect the Convention of Peru, on the subject of Claims has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business entrusted to it.— Difficultiesconcerning inter-oceanic tran sit throuehNicarargua are in course of ami cable adjustment. In conformity with the principles set forth in my last message 1 have recived representatives from theUnited States of Columbia, and have credited a Minister to that Ropublc. Incidents occurring in our civil war have forced upon my attention tho uncertain state of tho international question, touching the rights of foreigners in this country and also of citizens abroad. In regard to some Governments their rights are at least par tially defined by treaties In no instance, however, is it especially stipulated that in the instance of a civil war, a foreigner re siding in the country, within the lines of the insurgents, is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in •whose behalf tho Government of his coun try cannot express any principles or claim immunities disticnt from that character.— I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward,and in some instan ces, in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United Sates the greater part of their lives. There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries, who have declared their intention to be come citizens or who have been l'ullv natu ralized have evaded the military duty re quired of them by denying the'lact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burthen of proof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof, from the want of guides to the prop er sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring the clerks of courts, wheredeclarations of intention may be made, or naturalization effected, to pe riodically send lists of the names of persons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens, to the Secretary of the In terior, in whose Department these names must be arranged and printed for general information. There is also reason to believe that for eigners frequently become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of eva ding the duties imposed by the laws of their native country, to whieh, in becom ing ni.Miralized here, thev at once repair, and, tiumgh never returning to the United States, they still claim the interposition of the Government as citizens. Man? alter cations and great prejudices have hereto fore arisen out of this abuse. It is, there fore, submitted to your serious considera tion. It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States, residing abroad, may claim the in terposition of his Government. The right of suffrage has often been assumed and ex ercised by aliens under pretense of natural ization which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service. I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the laws as will make the fact of voting a bar against any plea of exemption from military service, or other special obliga tion#, on grounds of alienage. In common with other Western Powers •our relations with Japan have been bro't into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations. It is to be hoped, although not with entire •confidence, that these difficulties maybe peacefully overoome. I ask your attention to remuneration of the Minister residing -there, lor the damages he sustained in the "destruction, by fire, of the residence of the Legation at Yeddo. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia, which, it is believd, will result in effecting a con tinuous line of telegraph through that em pire from our Pacific coast. I recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an inter-national telegraph across the Atlantic ocean, and also of a telegraph be tween this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic sea-board and the Gulf of Mexico. Such communications, estab lished with very reasonable outlay, would be secured, as would give effective aid to diplomatic and naval service. The consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last Congress begins to be sef-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which willen- sue whenever peace is restored. Our minis ten abroad have been faithful in defending American rights, in proteeting our com mercial interests. Our Consuls nave neces sarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities, growing out of the %ar. The3$ thtff hare, jBr fBTmost.part, met and di&hirged £§al and effi ciency. Thlfe acknowledgment includes tnoseranmfc who, residing in Europe, •©bina arid other distant Countries, are charged with complicated and extraordi nary powers. The condition of the several organ ized Territories is generally satisfactory* although the Indian disturbances in New Mexico lgive not been entirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Ne vada, Idaho, New Mexico and Arizona are proving richer than heretofore un derstood. I lav before you a communica tion on this subject from the Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration. Although this source of national wealth is again fol lowing, with greater freedom, than fo*«ev eral years before the insurrection occurred, there is still a grgat deficiency of laborers in every field it industry, especially in ag riculture, and all our mines as well of iron and coal as of precious metals. While the demand for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands of persons destitute of re munerative1 occupation, are thronging our Foreign Consulates and offering to emigrate to the United. States, if. essential.but vacv cheap assistance can be afforded them, ft is easy to see that under the discipline of civil war, the nation is entering upon a new life—this effort demands the aid, an*1, ought to receive the attention and support of the government. Injuries unforseen by the government may in some cases have been inflicted upon the subjects or citizens of foreign countries both at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States. As this gov ernment expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by per sons in their service on citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners, and if the existing ju dicial tribunals are inadequate to this pur pose, a special Court may be authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to, as may have arisen under treaties and public law.— Conventions for adjusting claims by your commission, havabeen proposed to some governments, but no definite answer to the proposition has yet been receiyed from any. During the course of the Session, I shall, probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants. De crees of restitution have been rendered and damages awarded by the admiralty courts, and in other cases where this government may be'acknowledged to be liable in prin ciple and where the amount of liabilitj' has been ascertained by an informal arbitration. The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by laws of the United States upon the subject, to demand a tax upon the incomes of For eign Consuls in this country. While such a demand may not be in violation of public law, or perhaps of any existing treaty be tween the United States and any foreign country, the expediency of so far modify ing the act, as to exempt from tax the income which such Consuls as are not citi zens of the United States, may have deriv ed from the emoluments of their offices, or from property not located in the United States, is submitted to your serious consid eration. I make this suggestioii upon the ground that courtesy which ought to be reciprocated, exempts our Consuls in all other countries from taxation,to the extent of that indicated. The United States, I think, ought not to be deceptionally illib eral to international trade and commerce. The operations of the Treasury during the past year have been successfully con ducted. The enactment, bj' Congress, of a National Banking Law, has proved a valu able support of the public credit, and the general legislation in relation to the la\v has fully answered the expectations of its fra mers. Some amendments may be required to perfect existiug laws, but no change in their principles or general scope isbelieved to be needed. Since these measures have been in operation, all demands on the Treasury, includiug the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptly met and fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is belieyed, were ever more ain- ply provided, and more liberally and punc tuallv paid, and, it may be added, by no people were the burdens*incident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne. The receipts during the year, from all sources, including licenses and balance in Treasury at the Commencement, were £901, 1^5)^74 86 the aggregate disbursements, fs'95,796,,630 Go, leaving a balance on the 7th of uly, 1863, of *5,329,044 21. Of the receipts there were derived from Customs $69,057, 542 40 from internal revenue, §38,640.797 95 from direct taxes, $14,851,03(310 from lands. £107,617 17 from miscellaneous sources, #3,046,615 35 and from loans, §776,682,361 57 making the aggregate §901,125,674 86. Of 2!J8,600 93 for the Navy Department, §63, 211,105 27 for payment of funded and tern porary debt, *181,085,035 07 making the ag gregate 8895,766,030 65, and leaving a bal ance of $5,329,044 21. But the payment of the funded and temporary debt having been made from monies borrowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments, and the monies bor rowed to make these as merely nominal re ceipts, and their amount, $181,0N3,685 07, should therefore be deducted both from the receipts and disbursements. This bein" done, there remains, as actual recept^ §. 16,709,995 58, leaving the balance as al ready stated. The actual receipts and dis bursements for the first quarter, and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quarters of the current fiscal year of lb64, will beshown by the re port of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your'attention. It is suffi cient to say here, that it is not believed that the actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the estimates submitted by that officer, while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debts will be found very considerably less than has been anticipated. The report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest, 'it consists of the military operations of the year detailed in the report of the General-in-chief. Se cond, the organization of colored persons into the war service. Third, the exchange of prisoners is fully set forth in the letter of General Hitchcock. Fourth, the operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the National forces detail ed in the report of the Provost Marshal General's office. Fifth, the organization °*. Y16 Invalid corps. Sixth, the operationsJ ot the several departments of the Quarter Master Commissary General, Pavmaster. General, Chief of Ordnance and Surgeon General. It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report except such as would be too extended for this place, and I content myself in refer mgto your attention the reports. The duties devolving on the naval branch of service during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest, nave been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency as the navy has expended means, yet on so long a line it has so fer been impossible to en tirely suppress illicit trade. From the re turns received at the Navy Department it appears that more than one t/u»uaitd ves sels have been captured since the blockade was instituted, and that the value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amount to over thirteen million dollars. The naval forces of the United States consist at this time of 660 vessels completed and in the oourse of completion. And of these 76 are iron clad armored steamers. The events of the war give an increased interest and im portance to the Navy, which will probably extend beyond the war Itself. The armor eg vewels in eur navy completed, and in •ervioe^or which are under contract and Upproaahing completion are believed to ex ceed in number those of any other power. But while these may be relied upon fbr harbor defence and sea coast survey, others of greater strength and capacity will be ne cessary for cruising purposes, and to main tain our rightful positiqa on the ooean. The change that has taken place in naVy vessels and naval warfare since the intro duction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands either a corres ponding change in some of our existing navy yards or the establishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repairs of modern war vessels. No in considerable embarrassment to the public injury has been experienced from the want of such Government establishments. The necessity of such a navy yard, so furnished, at some suitable place upon the Atlantic sea-board, has, on repeated occa sions, been (brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again presented in.the report of the Secre tary, which accompanies this communi cation. I think it mv duty to invite your special attention to this subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for iSp that"Congress might aid both the army and naval service by adequate provisions on this subject, which would at the same time be equitable to the community more especially interested. IJreconimend to your consideration the suggestion of -the Secre tary of the Navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen for the naval service. The Naval Academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen ior highly responsible duties which in alter life they will be required to perform. In order that the country should not be deprived of educated officers, for which legal provision has been made at the naval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nomi nations from the States, have been tilled by the Secretary of the Navy.— The School is now more full and efficient than at any previous period, and is in eve ry respect entitled to the favorable consid eration of Congress. During tli£ past fiscal year the condition of the Post Office Department has been one of increasingprosperity, and I am gratiried in being able to state that the receipts of postal revenue currency has nearly equal ed the entire expenditures, amounting to §11,314,000 24, and the later to §11,630, 895 90, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417 25. In I860, the year immediately preced ing the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to §5,650,705 49. The postal receipts of that year being §2,045,722 19 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent, but the annual expendi tures on account of the same has been re duced 25 per cent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post Office Department may be come self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole service.— The International Conference of postal delegates from the principal countries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of the Post Master General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last, and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles established bv the Conference are the nest adapted tofaci'litate postal intercourse between nations and the basis of future conventions, inaugurating a general system of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage that cannot fail to produce beneficial results. I refer you to the report of the Secretary of tho Interior, which is herewith laid be fore you, for useful and varied information in relation to the Public Lands, Indian Af fairs, Patents, Pensions and other matters of public concern, pertaining to his Depart ment. The ':uautity of bind disposed of, during the last, and the first quarter of the present fiscal year, was three million eight hundred aud l'ortv-one thousand five hund red and forty-nine acres, of which 161,911 acres were sold for cash, 1,456,514 acres, were taken up under the Homestead law, and the residue was disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties, rail road, and other purposes, 'it also appears that the sale of the public lands is largelv on the increase. It has long been a cher ished opinion of some of our most eminent statesmen, that the people of the United States, had a far higher and more enduring interest in the early settlement and sub stantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of distinct revenue to be de rived from the sale of them. This opinion has bad controlling influence in forming legislation on the subject of our National Domain. I may cite, as evidencing this, the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual settlers, the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within their limits in order to their being reclaimed and render ed fit for cultivation, the grant to railroad companies, of alternate sections of land up on the contemplated lines of their roads, which, when completed, will largely multi ply the facilities for reaching our distaut possessions. This act has received its most sJ?na^ benificent encouragement in» the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers. Since the first day of January last, the before-mentioned quan tity of one million four hundred aud fifty six thousand five hundred and fourteen acres of land, has been taken up under its provisions. This fact, and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of increas ing settlement upon the public lands, not withstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nation have beeiv engag ed, and whichhas required so large a with drawal of our citizens from their accus tomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, suggesting the modification of the act in favor of those roads engaged in the Military and Naval service or the United States. I doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essentially changing the promi nent features of the system, procure the greatest practicable benefits to those who have left their homes in defence of the Country in this arduous crisis 

WEEKLY HAWK-EYE. Secretary of War as to the propriety of raising, by approbation of legislatures, a revenue from the mineral lands of the United States. The measures provided at your last ses sion for the removal ~xtt~ certain Indian tribes have been carried into, effect. Sun dry treaties have been negotiated, which will in due time be submitted for constitu tional action of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of land. It is probable that the effect of these treaties will result in' the establishment of permanent friendly relations with auch of those tribes as have been brought into fre quent and bloodjr collisions with our out lying settlements and emigrants. Sound policy, and the imperative duty of the Gov ernment towards them, demand our anx ious and constant attention to their material well-being, to their progress in the arts of civilization, and above all, to that moral training which,, under the blessing of Di vine Providence, will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences, and the hopes and consolations of the christian faith. I. suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our Indian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The details set forth in the report of the Secretary will evince the urgent need for immediate legis lative action. road purposes upon the line of established or natro»»ia«d bv the government in this District, to your iwcB uas oeen crea­ ted on these interior waters, under many disadvantages, within little more than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the com mencement of the present Administra tion. Satisfactory and important as have been the performances of the heroic men of the navy j^t this interesting period. They are scarcely more wonderful than the services of our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels which has created a new form of naval power. Our country has advantages superior to any other nation, in our resources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quanti ties of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all available and in clone prox imity to navigable waters, without the ad vantage of public works. The resources of the nation have been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a navjr of such magnitude, which has at the very period of its creation rendered signai service to the Union. The increase of the number of seamen in the .public service from ,7,000 men in the spring of 1861 to about 24,000 at the present time has been accomplished with out special legislation and extraordinary bounties to promote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operation of the draft wtth the high bounties paid fbr army recruits is beginning to effect inju riously tho naval'service, and will, if not corrected, be likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the army^ I therefore respectfully suggest I commend the benevolent object of the generous and fostering care The attention of Congress during the last session was occupied to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water com munications between the Mississippi Riv er and the North-eastern seaboard, which proposition, however, failed for the time.— Since then, upon a call of the greatest re spectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same subject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the President and Congress and which I now have the honor to lay be fore you. That this interest is one which ere long will force its own way, I do not entertain a doubt, while ilQs submitted en tirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now. Augmented interest n given to this subject by the actual com mencement of work upon the Pacific Rail road, under auspices so favorable to its ra pid progress and completion, that enlarg ed navigation becomes palpably needed to the great road. I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the Nation. When Congress assembled a year ago the war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been manv c«n flicts both on land and sea, with varving results. The rebellion had been pushed back.in reduced limits. Yet the tone of pub iie feeling and opinion at home and abroad was not satisfactory. With other signs the popular elections, then just passed, indi cated uneasiness among ourselves, while amid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest words, coming from Europe, ut tered in accents of pity, were that we were too blind to surrender our^commerce, which was suffering fearfully bv a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from for eign shores. We were threatened with such mercies from the same quar, er as would sweep our trade from the sea aud raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from Furopean governments anything hopeful upon this subject. Ths Emancipation pro clamation, which was issued in September, was running its assigned period to the be ginning of New Year. A month later the tinal proclamation came, including tho announcement that colored men of suita ble condition would be received into the war service. The policy of Emancipation and employing black sotdiers gave to the future a new aspact, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict. According to our political system as a matter of civil administration, the General had no lawful power to effect emancipation iu any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the neeessity for it might come, and that if it should, the crisis of the contest would then be present ed. It came and, as was expected, it was followed bydark and doubtful davs. Elev en months have been passed. We are per mitted to take another review. The rebel borders are pressed still further back, and by the complete opening of the Mississippi river, the country dominated over by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts with no practical communication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been so substantially cleared of insurgents, that the controlling influence of the citizens in each and owners of slaves and advocates of sla verv at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective Slates. Of those States not in cluded in the Emancipation Proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which, years ago, would tolerate any restraint up on the extension of slaverv into the new teritories, only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their limits. Of those who were slaves at the begin ning of the rebellion, full one hundred thousand are now in the United States military service, about one-half of which number actuatlv bear arms in* the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the place which otherwise must be filled with so many white men.— So far as tested, it is difficult to say that they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures ot emancipation and arming the blacks.— These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and contemporary with such discussion, the tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticised and de nounced, and the annual elections follow ing are highly encouraging to those whose speci.'il duty it is to bear the country thro' tnis great tnal. Thus we have the reckon ing: The crisis which threatened to di vide the friends of the Union, is past.— Looking now to the present and. future, and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within theStates where in that autority has been suspended, I have' thought fit to issue a Proclama tion, a copy of which is herewith transmit ted. On examination of this Proclamation it will appear, as is believed, amply justi fied by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. A man is only promised a par don in case he voluntarilv takes the oath.— The Constitutiou'atithorizes the Executive to grant terms as is fully established by udicial and other authorities. It also is provided that if any of these States make a State Government, and do, the mode prescribed, set up such Government, it shall be recognized and guaranteed by the Uuited States, and that under it the State shall under the Con stitution be protected against invasion and domestic violence. The constitution al obligation of the United States to guar autee to every State in the Union a re publican form of government and to pro tect the State is explicit and full. But why tender the benefits of this provision to a State Government, set up in this par ticular way? This section of the Consti tution contemplates a case wherein the el- em®°t within a State favorable to a re­ publican government in the Union may be protected from an opposite and hos s tu ^jent, external to and even with in the State. And such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing.— An attempt to guarantee and protect a re- publican State Government, constructed in whole or in part from the very ele ment against whose hostility and violence it is to De protected, is simply absurd.— There must be a test by which to sepa rate opposing elements, so as to build only from the sournl, *nd~ that test Is a sufficient ly Iwertll one which accepts as qpch who ever wilL. make a swtrn recantation (ft his former *unsoundiiMs. But if1, it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and Union under it, also to the laws and pro clamation in regard to slavery. These laws and proclamation were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding the suppression of the rebellion—to give their fallest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my judgment thev have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were enlisted. To give up this principle would be not only to relin quish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and astounding breach of faith.— I may add at this point that while I re main in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modifvthe Emancipa tion Proclamation, nor sliall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of the Proclamation or by any act of Congress. For these and other reasons it is thought best that the support of these persons shall be included in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim it in return for Dardons and the re storation of forfeited "rights, wLicu ue clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant, upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public in terest. It should be observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legis lation and supreme judicial decision. The proposed accquiesence of the Na tional Executive in any^ionorable tempo rary State arrangement for the freed peo ple is made with the view of possibly mod ifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes bv a total revolution of labor throughout tile whole States. It is hoped that the already deeply afllcted in these States may be somewhat more ready to give up the affliction, and to this extent this vital matter is left to them selves, while no power of the National Ex ecutive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition. The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the politi cal frame works of the States or what is called reconstruction, is made in thejhope that it may do good without the danger of harm it will save labor and avoid great confusion. But why any proclamation|now, when this subject, this question is met with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too.long or be taken too soon? In some the elements for resumption seem ready for action, but they remain inactive, apprently for the want of a rallying point, a plan of action. Why shall we adopt the plan of B, rather than that of A. If A and should agree, how can thev know but that the general Government here will reject their plan? By the Proclamation a plan is presented to them as a rallying point, and which they are assured advance will not be rejected here this may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would.— The objection of a presentation of a plan by the National Executive consists in the manner of settling p6ints which could be more safely left to farther developments. Care has been taken to so shape the docu ment as to avoid embarassments from this source, in sayinrtliaton certainrterms cer tain classes will be pardoned with their rights restored, it is not said that other clsses on othe^rterios will ever be inclilded, Insayinga reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way. The movement for emancipation in sev eral of the States not included in the eman cipation Proclamation, are matters ot pro found gratification. And while I do not re peat in detail what I have heretofore so ear nestly urged upon this subject, my memo rial views and feelings remain unchanged, and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these.important steps to the great consummation. In the midst of other cares, however important, we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power alone can we look. Yet for a time to come the people in contested regions must look that the insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that confidence shall be established, little can be done any where for what is called reconstruction.' Hence our chief care must still be directed to our Army and Navy, who have thus far done their labor so nobly and well, and it may be esteemed that in giving the greatest effi ciency to these indispensable arms, we do also honorably encourage gallant men, from commander to sentinel,'who compose them, and to whom more than to all others, the world stands indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated, enlar ged and perpetuated.

To avoid misunderstanding, it may lie proper to say that this Proclamation, so far as it relates to State Governments, has no reference to States wherein loyal State Governments have all the while been maintained and for the same reason it may be proper further to say that whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats conventionally, rests exclusively with the respective Hou ses, and not to any extent|with the Execu tive. And still further, that this Proclama tion is intended to present to the people of the States wherein the National authority has been suspended and loyal State Gov ernments have been subverted, a mode by which the National authority over every loyal State Government may be established within said States, or any of them and while the mode presented is the be»t the Executive can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be understood that another possible mode would not be ac cepted.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. By the President, WM. II. SEWARD, Secretary of State. Brier abstract of the Report of the Secretary ot War. NEW YORK, Dec. 8.—The report of the Secretary of War is of considerable length. It reviews our victories aud pays a high tribute to the bravery and skill of our troops. He says the combined operations of our Army and Navy against Charleston have not as yet accomplished what was ex pected of them. In Texas, a large force under Banks will give protection to the people of that State, an'd cut off a chief av enue of the rebels for foreign commerce and foreign aid. The armies of Lee and Meade now occupy relatively the same positions as they did at the start of the last annual report. West Virginia is now clear of rebels, and the people of that State are enjoying in comparative peace the bless ings of civil government. The rebel forces in Missouri have been driven beyond the Arkansas river. N,o military operations of any magnitude have taken place in Vir ginia or North Carolina. The Federal fbrces are now planted in every rebel State. The success of our arms during the past year has enabled the Department to make a reduction of over $200,000,000 in the estimates for the current year. The troubles in regard to the exchange of prisoners is reviewed at length, and the blame for the non-exchange thereof, falls upon the rebel authorities. He alludes to the good treatment the rebel prisoners have received at our hands, and denounces the rebel authorities for the cruel manner in which they have treated our prisoners in their hands. He then discusses the act of Congress for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and says that the law has been enforced in twelve Slates, yield ing 50,000 men and $10,000,000 for procuring substitutes. The $300clause is alluded to as are also the confiictingopinionsin regard to its justice and injutice. He says that a large proportion of the troops whose terms expire next year will re-enlist, it being stipulated by the Government that they shall have at least one month's furlough before their present term expires. The in dications are that the force required will in a great measure be raised by volunteering and without a draft. An immediate ap propriation for bounties should be made. He then alludes to the valuable service the Invalid Corps has rendered to the Gov ernment. The corps now number 20,000 officers and privates. He says, immediately after the issu ance of the President's Paoolamation dili gent efforts were commenced aud have continued until the preseut time for raising colored troops. 50,000 colored men are now oiganiaed, and the number will ra pidly increase as our armies judvance The freed slaves make gooa soldiers, and are easily disciplined,'aud are full of cour age. The slave has proved his manhood aud capacity and makes a good infantry, artillery or cavalry soldier, as has been evidenced on several occasions. The col ored troops have beeu allowed no bounties under the construction given by the De partment. They cau only by the laws re ceive 10 dollars per month for their ser vices, while white soldiers receive $13 with clothing, and a daily ration. Tho fortunes of war have brought within our lines large numbers of colored women and children, and some aged and infirm persons. A sol emn trust rests upon the Government for their care and protection. The Adjutant General recommends the term of enlistment in the regular service, be fixed at three years, instead of five, in accordance with the act of 1853, which ex pired by limitation on the 1st of Jauuqfy, 1S63. The Secretary gives a list of the prin cipal ordnance matters, which were in the control of the Department at the beginning of the war, Ac., and the quantities of those articles which have since been procured, and the Quantities of those articles on hand June 30,1863. The figures are immense. The operations of the Chief Engineer, connected with the survey of the Northern
