Merchant Marine Plea Applanded. He read slowly and deliberately. He was first interrupted when he asserted that "we have stunted and hindered the growth of our merchant marine." A scattered outburst of applause greeted the statement. After speaking of the "notable rec ord" of legislation of the administra toon, the president departed from tho text of his address to say that the pro-,' graim of the administration with re gard to legislation affecting business "is now virtually completed." It had been put forth by congress, the president continued, as "we in tended as a hope, and needs no con jecture as to what was Intended.'^j Business Road Clear. The road for business to travel, tho president declared, was clear and firm a road where business could travel without fear, "a road to unclouded sue cess." "In it," the president declared, 'ev ery honest man may walk with con-! fidence." Another burst of handclapplng greet-' ed ihp statement that the building government shipping lines to South and Central America was imperative.

In the text of his'address touching upon the legislative program for the session, urging passing pf bills for .Philippine Independence, government owned merchant marine and some oth er projects begun but unfinished at the lust session, the., president devoted much time to the discussion of national defense, endorsing a development of the national guard. The democratic side of both house and senate greeted with applause and laughter his declaration "that some of us are nervous and excited," and that "we shall not turn America Into a mili tary camp," "Especially when half the world is on fire," he said, "we shall make our insurance against conflagration definite indeed." This sentiment was favorably re ceived on both sides Of the chamber. Docs Not Expect Extra Sessions.

A recommendation to terminate the Colorado coal miners strike which had its inception in the northern Colo rado fields in April, 1910, and which for more than fourteen months ha,s in volved the entire coal mining industry In Colorado, was contained in a com munication from the International ex ecutive board of the United Mino Workers' of America, presented by Frank Ilays, vice president to the union miners of Colorado, in conven tion- here today.

Result of President's Action. After reviewing the efforts of the federal government to effect a settle ment of the controversy and quoting correspondence of President Wilson and the miners' officials, the resolution says: "The recent action of appointing a federal mediation commission, we deem it the part of wisdom to accept his (the president's) suggestion and to terminate the strike."

Philadelphia, Dec. —Bddle Coll too. star second baseman of tho Phila delphia Athletics, was sold today to tho Chicago Americans. According to Connie Mack, manager of the cham pion Athletics, negotiations have been under way for some time and the deal was consummated in New York today, the contracts being signed in tha*'! city. 4,2. Mr. Mack declined to make public1 the amount of money Involved In tho\ deal but It ie believed to have been a record breaking sum. One report say* the sale price was |50,000. The announcement, which voluntarily from Connie Mack, created a bigger sensation In baseball circles than his action several weeks ago In asking waivers on Pitchers Bender, Plank and Coombs. There has been par elstant rumors that negotiations Ware under way to release Collins to the New York Americans, but these re ports wore denied. Whether the Philadelphia manage* ment decided to part with Collins be cause the cash consideration was- oo ltu«e or because the club had deolded that a change woo necessary could not be learned. Refused Offer From Federals. The Federal League tried to get Collins but he remained loyal to the Athletics and last summer signed a contract for a term of years. It waa reported that the Federals had offered Collina J25.000 a year for three year*. In Collins the Chicago Atnerlfeons obtain one of the greatest second bade men that ever played at the mUMUo bag. He is 37 years old .and a.. graduate of Coluitffill where he received his sarly haimhsll eduoatlon. Since becoming a regular member of the Athletics he was easily the star of Connie Mack'a famous 9100,000 lnfleld. He is one of the qulckest-witted men on the ball field, and thto, combined with his wonderful skill as a fielder, runner and batter, has made him -a king of the diamond. He has led,the league as abase runner and always has been well up In batting and as a run getter. His batting average in the sea son Just closes wan .344, he- being sec ond to Ty Cobb, who led the league. Collins" sale to the Chicago club Is the first break in Mack's great lnfleld which has won pennants and world's championships. Humor has It that Baker will be the next to go, a report from the west sev eral days ago stating that the famous homo run hitter was about to jump to the l-vderuls. Baker has not denied tlie report. With the sale of Collins, following so closely on tho release of Bender, Plank ami Coombs, tho great Mack machine apparently Is to give way to the formation of a now club, composed largely of younger players. Whether Colllnts will follow the nctlon of tho Athletic pitchers and Jump to the out law organization is not. of course, known, but from the nature of today's announcement it Is taken that the deal was consummated with tho consent of the player and he will report at Chi cago next spring. It is not likely that, with ibi large sum Involved, the deal would have been tnndo without an understanding with Collina as to his intentions. Collins Signs For Five Year*.
