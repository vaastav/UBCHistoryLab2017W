Wo say again, "Keep your eye on Jim Campbell next fall." A di:taim:u statement of tho piins and losses or the two leading parties at the recent election has been prepared in tho oillce of the Secretary of State and shows that tho net Ilepublicnn gain over the vote of 1801 was 13,103, while the not Democratic gain was87,G17. Point, if you dare, Republican calamity howler, to one interest that you predicted death to, under tho Wilson bill, but.hns sprung in to newness of life since its passage; and was as dead as u door nail un der tho Mcltinlcy bill. Ye,t here's one. Wo forget it. Tho tramp business Is about destroyed. Jack son Herald. Ahout the only pooplo who seem desirous ol having drover Cleve land accept a third term of the presidency are our Republican friends. Wo do not believe Hint tho president himself nor any of tho Democratic, lenders hnvo any idea of nominating him for n third term. Tho Democratic party is not enough in favor of paternalism for that. Marion Democrat. By all means let us hnvo a pompous inaugural of Governor Buslinell. Let (hero be n stunning array of soldiery, with guns and horses and sabres. Let a few per sons be killed as evidence thnt'our state government is alive, and ready for business after January 13 next. A big parade in tho day and n big ball at night will help tho taxpayer to bear their burdens. The Texas Democrat, published nt Bonlm.n, says this paper started out as a "round money" organ, and strnyed nwny Into tho free silver fold. Which might bo taken as true, for blmetalism provhTes for hound money. Tho goldltes, how over, claim that no money is sound unless the monarchies of Europe upprovo it. A fig for such doctrine. Let us havo money that tho people of this country npprove; and then if wo can't paddle our own canoe we'll sellout to England altogether. It seems strange, however, that a brother Democrat bhould so lacer ate tho truth. Wetfierjord (Texas) Dcm. TUB SlIiVEIt 

DEMOCRATS l'roposo Making nil Independent Campaign IfNcccRsarf. The pllver Democrats of Ohio, propose going Into the presidential campaign next year. Judge E. J. Blandln, who stands close to Allen W. Thurman, of Col umbus, sahl that plans wero being formed for the nomination of a sli ver enndiduto for tho presldenoy. A conference of tho silver men will be lipid in January, either nt Chicago or Washington, tonrrnngo for a convention to bo held in April next. It Is proposed to nominnte Sibley of Pennsylvnn!nt for president, nnd somo western mnn for vico presi dent. "With thoso cnndldatcs," said Judge Blandln, "wo will go to tho Democratic national conven tion nnd ask for Its endorsement Jf tho Democrats rcfuso to endorso tho ticket, wo name, wo shall make an Independent campaign." Tho Coming Mcssniro. It has been announced, 'from Washington, upon what authority wo do not know, that the message which President Clcvoland will send to tho 54th congress nnd to the bennto will bo short nnd dovotod almost entirely flnnnclnl affairs. It is to ho believ ed that this announcement is noth ing more than n inore guess based on what scorn reasonable probabil itics. Any ono reviewing national nffalrs at this time from tho stand point of President Cleveland, should bo able to discover without nny great mental effort that the chief executlvo ol thonntion under present conditions can say but very llttln except in relation to tho op eration of tho new tariff law and in connection with tho financial af fairs and prospects of the govern ment. Of course he can communi cate silent tacts of the reports of the various cabinet officials and he can touch.'very briefly upon foreign affairs, but tho burden of tho argu ment, if tliero Is nny attempted, must rest upon tho business out look. Tliero is every reason nlsn why President Clovelnnd should cut that portion of his message down to ns fow words ns possible. His position is well known nnd he probably realizes that further ex planation is unnecessary. It is to bo expected, however, that the message will contain ono or two strong recommendations In con nection with foreign affairs. For in'stn'nce, tho president will proba bly recommend federal participa tion in tho Nicaragua cnnal and he may hnvo something to say about tiio Alaska boundary question. It is hardly to bo believed, however, that tho president will go into the Venezuelan question. Mr. Cleveland has a splendid op portunity to make somo new friends by this message and it Is more than probnblo that he will do so. Tho firmer his declaration up on tho financial question the more pronounced will bo tho applause foi his message. HE GOT
