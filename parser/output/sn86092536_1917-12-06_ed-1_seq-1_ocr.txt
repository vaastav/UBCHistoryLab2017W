WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.? Imme ? diate action to effect national uni. fication of the railroads, either by government operation or by sus pension for the war of anti-trust and anti-pooling laws, a federal loan and regulation of security is sues to permit more effective vol untary co-operation, was recom mended today by the Interstate Commerce commission in a speci fic report to congress. Neither plan waj specifically en dorsed. but an implication that the majority believed the railroads might successfully work out their own unification, prompted Com missioner McChord to submit a separate report emphatically urg ing government control and say ing. "the strong arm of government authority is essential if the trans portation situation is to be radical ly improved." Any voluntary pooling plan would fail to meet war exigencies, he declared, be cause of the unavoidable influence of selfishness among the roads. i There was no disagreement as I to the proposition that competl- j tion among railroads must be di- i . minished, if not altogether elimi. i nated. to prevent a serious break- ] down of transportation facilities, j under the war's strain.

President | J Wilson's message to congress has , the fullest possible prominence in the morning newspapers but It reached London too late for much considered comment. The Dally News receives warmly the presi dent's declaration that peace should be based on generosity and justice to the exclusion of selfish claims. It adds: "It would be affectation to pre tend that this language echoes j the declarations of the European | spokesmen of the alliance. It Is j the voice of a statesman whose ( v'sion comprehends the world, t while theirs comprehends only half the world. ? "If President Wilson could have i said earlier what he said ye?ter- | day, and if in Great Britain, ; France and Italy the responsible j leaders had made his language [ theirs, Russia might be today driv- ' Ing the enemies from her borders. It may be too late to convince Russia of the identity of the aim of herself and the allied democ racies, but It must not be too late for those democracies to learn from their greatest representa tive how democracies should com port themselves In war and how they should attain peace. *' I n the light of President Wll son's speech a statement that will mean the wiping off the slate of much that should never have been written on It Is Imperative.
