Meetings of tne Board of Agriculture The State Board of Agriculture hold two meetings in the county next week. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Dec. 10 and 17. at Irasburgh, on Thursday and Friday, Dec. 18 and 19, at Craftsbury. We have not received the program in season for this paper, but it vill be such as to make the meetings of much interest to all farmers and citizens. The Hoard has been reorganized and is composed of gentlemen, who are practically as well as scientifically in formed in the subjects to be discussed. They are for the greater part men who own and run farms and who have been selected because they know what they talk about. We think the farmers in Vermout, many of them, make a great mistake iu not attend ing aud hearing these meetings. It must be a pretty stupid man and a no toriously poor meeting if a farmer can not see enough and learn enough in one of these gatherings, to make it profitable for him to attend. Vermont must wake up in her farming interests and it behooves her people to make the most possible of every opportu nity to learn something of the sci ence and the approved methods in agriculture. The world moves ; the wooden plow has been superseded ; the best methods of old have given place to the better methods of the present. A man in this age must study, read, think, know, or he will certainly get left. We hope these meetings will be well attended. The President's Message. The following is a synopsis of the president's message : To the Senate and House of Rep resentatives : The vast and increas ing business of the government has been transacted by the departments during the year with faithfulness, energy and success. The revenues have been collected and disbursed without a single case of defalcation or embezzlement, and the work of all public otlicers has almost wholly es caped unfavorable criticism. The credit of this good work is shared by department heads with their subordi nates. The ciose scrutiny of con gress is invited to all administrative methods and expenditures. Our friendly lelations with Europe and eastern uations have been undis turbed, while our ties to the states of the western hemisphere have been strenghtened by the important convo cation of independent states of the American continent, held in the capi tal, from October, 1880, -till last April, pursuant to congressional in vitation. This convention makes an influential epoch in the history of the western hemisphere. Its recommend tions were transmitted to congress at the last session. The president refers to the fact that a republican form of govern ment has been established in Brazil and expresses confidence that our re lations with the new republic will continue most cordial and that our commerce with that country will in crease. He alludes to Central America troubles and the killing of Gen. Bar rundia, in connection with which the president felt called upon to disavow the action of the United States Min ister Mizoer, who exeeded his au thority, and recall hiaj from his post. The Nicaraguan canal project is making satisfactory progress ; also negotiations for the payment of claims of citizens of the United States against the government of Chili. Tbe message touches biiefly upon our relation with China and France, j which remain practically the same a9 ; a year ago, and says that good re- suits from the Samoan treaty made last year promise to be soon appar I ent. I The beneficial working of the new extradition treaty with Great Britian is already evident. The difference touching the Behi ing i sea fur seal question is not adjusted. Her majesty's offer of submission to I arbitration has not beeu accepted, be- cause the form of submission pro posed, it is not thought, would as sure a conclusion satisfactory to either party. It is hoped before another sealing season the United States will be assured a property right derived from Russia, and not disregarded by any nation for 80 years preceding the outbreak of the existing trouble. Iu the tariff act duties are levied on articles included in a reciprocity treaty with Havana without indicat ing an exception in that kingdom's case. I presume this to be interna tional, and hope congress will repair what otherwise might seem a breach of faith on our part. The president refers to the claims of United States citizens against Hayti; the proposed amendment of the extradition treaty with Italy and the invitation of Italy to take part in a conference to consider the adop tion of a prime meridian from which to reckon longitude, and approves his predecessor's suggestion that standing provision be made for ac cepting invitations of foreign govern ments to share in international con ferences. He refers to the incident of the seizure of the Allegudo bay railway by Portugal, the claims of American and British citixens, and the submis sion of the question to three jurists designated by the president of the Swiss republic. Grave and delicate questions exist in our relations with Japan, but it is believed that they can and will be adjusted in a friendly manner. Our friendship with Mexico was never more conspicuous than now nor more hopeful of increased bene fits to both nations. The extent and development of our trade with the island of Cuba in vest the commercial relations of the United States with Spain with a peculiar importance and the presi dent bplieves that a special arrange ment in regard to commerce, based upon the reciprocity provision of the recent tariff act, would operate most beneficially for both countries. The president briefly touches upon the financial exhibit made by our government, showing that the re ceipts from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, were 8403,903,080, and the expenditures 6328,018,584. The surplus for the year including the amount applied to the sinking fund, was 105,344,490 The treasury statement for the fis cal year, partly estimated, shows re ceipts from all sources $400,000,000, total expenditures from all sources f3o4, 000,000, leaving a surplus of 852,000,000, not taking the postal receipts into account. The loss of customs revenue for the last quarter is estimated at $25, 000,000, but from this is deducted a gain of about 810,000,000 realized during the first four months of the year. The president says : "The recent depreciation in the price of silver has been observed with regret. The rapid rise in price which anticipated and followed the passage of the act 'directing the purchase of silver bul lion and the issue of treasury notes therefor' was influenced in some de gree by speculation, and the recent reaction is in part the result of the same cause and in part of the recent monetary disturbance. Some months of further trial will be necessary to determine the permanent effect of the recent legislation upon silver val ues," but it is gratifying to know that the increased circulation secured by the act has exerted, and will continue to exert, a most beneficial influence upon business and upon general values. Referring to the report of the Sec retary of the interior, the president notes that the cost of collecting the customs revenue was les9 last year than ever before. Concerning the experience of the members of the customs administrative board provid ed for by the act of June last, he 6poke of the evils they are to correct, undervaluation, resulting in discrim ination against honesty, urged the value of their services, and sard high duties should not be remedied by quasi-smuggling. The president calls attention to the report of the secretary of war as j showing a reductinn of 24 per cent in ! deserters from the army under the j act of June 10 ; also beneficial effects of the constitution of the hospital ! and service record bureaus. He con ; curs in the secretary's recommenda ; tions for the regular coast defense I appropriations, and recommends the I continuance and enlargement of the j national guard. i The president cilia attention to the ' prominent attention giving election cases by the department of justice, and to its prosecution of cases of per secution of presidential postmasters. ; He recommends amendments of j naturalization laws, j An attempt will be made to pro ' hibit pool selling in the District of Columbia. The president commends the post master general's report as showing a reduction in deficit and improvement in service. He also refers to the lot tery law and its prompt enforcement by the postal department. The president says that the con struction and equipment of the new ship3 for onr navy have made very satisfrctory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels have been put in commission and four more will be added this winter. It is a source of congratulation that the anticipated influence of these modern vessels upon the esprit du corps of the officers and seamen has been fnlly realized and confidence and pride iu the ships among the crew are equivalent to a secondary battery. Favorable consideration of con gress is invited to the recommenda tions of the secretary. Favorable action by congress upon the various recommendations of the secretary of the interior is urged. Attention is called to the fact that certain proposed agreements and ap propriations made in connection' with some of the Indian tribes have not yet received the official sanction of congress, and this should be prompt ly attended to. If an agreement is confirmed, all its terms should be complied with without.delay, and full appropriations should be made. The disability pension act has been put into operation as rapidly as pos sible, and examination and adjudi cation of claims have been made more rapidly than ever under im proved methods. There is no econo my to the governments in delay, while there is much hardship and in justice to the soldier. Referring to the Mormon question the president says that while the re cent letter of the president of the Mormon church advising his people "to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of the land" has had a most beneficial influence, yet it must not be overlook ed that ihe belief of the people that polygamous marriages are right has not changed. It is true that the law should not attempt to deal with the faith or belief of anyone, but it is quite another thing, and the only safe thing, so to deal with the territory of Utah that those who believe poly gamy to be rightful shall not have the power to make it lawful. The admission of new states is happily alluded to the work of the patent office commended, and atten tion briefly called to the completion of the census. In reference to the agricultural de partment the president calls atten tion to the fact that, while the farm ers have organized to increase their profits, market prices of leading farm products have advanced substantially during the year and the export trade in live animals and beef and pork products has largely increased. This trade will be further increased by in spection and sanitary supervision. The inspection abroad, secured by the secretary's efforts, and that at home provided for by the act of Aug. 30, 1890, will afford as perfect guar antee for wholesomeness as is any where given any food product. The president approves the devel opment of the best sugar industry,, and notes the concurrence of the secretary of the treasury of agricul ture to transfer the official supervisor of domestic sugar to the department of agriculture. The president spoke of the passage of many important laws by the last session of congress, and their quick ening effect upon manufacturing in dustries, larger and better markets for breadstuffs and provisions, more constant employment for working people, and safe currency, but says beneficial effects on commerce have as yet but partially manifested them selves. The balance of trade, which for two years had been against us, is now in our favor. Bank clearings show an increase of 8.4 per cent, indicat ing a general increase in the volume of business throughout the country which the decrease of failures shows to be on a safe basis. Labor is ev-. erywhere fully employed and fewer employes have been affected by strikes and lockouts than since 1884.' The depression in prices of agiicul tural products have been relieved ; the promising influences were check ed by recent unfavorable monetary events in England, but there was no loss of credit in American securities, and it is not believed these incidents can long withstand the influences op erating to give our people profitable returns in trade. The apprehension that our tariff may again at once be subjected to important general chang es would undoubtedly add a seriously depressing influence. Considerable space is devoted to the consideration of the tariff. The president says upon this subject that the general tariff act has as yet only partially gone into effect ; that its success or failure can be as yet only a matter of conjecture ; but that it is curious to note that the advance of articles wholly unaffected by the tariff, but caused by influences en tirely removed from the recent tariff legislation, was by many ascribed to that act. There is neither wisdom nor jus tice in the suggestion that the subject of tariff revision shall be again open ed before this law has had a fair tri al. Xo tariff bill can perfectly satis fy every interest, but the president believes that the present law, in its general scope and effect, will justify the support of those who believe that American legislation should conserve and defend American trade and the wages of American workmen. Under this law the president looks for an enlarged and more profitable participation in foreign trade than we have ever enjoyed and the recovery of a proportionate participation in the ocean carrying trade of the world. There is no disposition among an' of our people to promote prohibitory or retaliatoay legislation, aud our policies are adopted not to the hurt of others, but to secure for ourselves those advantages that fairly grow out of our favored position as a na tion. "From the time of my introduction into office, the duty of using every power and influence giv en by law to the executive depart ment for the development of larger markets for our products, has been kept constantly in mind, and no ef fort has been or will be spared to promote that eud." "We are under no disadvantage in any foreign market, except that we pay our workmen and workwomen better wages than are paid elsewhere better absolutely, better relatively, to the cost of tbe necessities of life." Tbe passage of the tariff bill in its present shape, the president says, ex presses in advance the consent of congress to reciprocity arrangements affecting our products which must otherwise have been delayed and un ascertained until each treaty was rati fied by legislation enacted by con gress. The indications thus far given are very hopeful of early and favorable action by the countries from which we receive our large imports of cof fee and sugar, and it is confidently believed that if steam communication with these countries can be promptly improved and enlarged the next year will show a most gratifying increase of our exports of breadstuffs and pro visions, as well as of important lines of manufactured goods. Prompt action by congress upon important bills left over by the last session is strongly urged, and in view of the large amount of work to be done in this direction, the president refrains from presenting other sug gestions that would otherwise be made. He reviews the suggestions made in his last message relative to the development of our steamship lines, and says there is now, both in this country and in the nations of of Central and South America, a state of expectation and confidence as to increased trade that will give a double value to prompt action upon this question by congress. The present situation of mail com munication with Australia is recom mended to congress as needing early action. The colonies of New South Wales and New Zealand are paying the Oceanic steamship company more than the United States for mail ser vice and refuse to renew the contract, now expiring, unless we pay a more equitable proportion. The export trade to these islands is very profita ble, and, unless we wish to see that this line withdrawn, congress should empower the postmaster general to make a liberal increase in our pay ment for the transportation of these mails. The president here refers to the fa vored position of the South Atlantic and gulf ports toward the new com merce promoted by the reciprocity clause of the tariff act and the postal shipping bill, justifies the large ap propriation for Galveston harbor by this consideration, and says the north west will feel the advantage of south ern trunk lines. He renews the recommendation that an international American bank be granted a charter, and urge prompt action. The passage of the bill for the re lief of the supreme court is recom mended, and a readjustment of the salaries of the district court judges. The immediate adjustment of the Spanish and Mexican land grants is urged, and the suggestions of the secre tary of the interior as to the amend ments of pending bills are commend ed. The enactment of a national bank rupt law is recommended ; also an international copyright law, legisla tion to secure safety couplers and brakes upon frieght trains used in in terstate commerce, and some provis ion looking to the conservation and distribution of the water supply of the arid region. The United States should not construct dams or canals, but by surveys determine the supply, areas capable of irrigation, and loca tion and capacity of reservoirs. The use of water and reservoirs might be ranted to states or individuals on conditions securing the common and equal use at a fair rate of the accumulated water. The government should not own or operate the railroads or the telegraph but could contract with the telegraph companies to carry messages at speci fied rates, and legislation "is recom mended enabling the postoffice to test by experiment the advantages of such a use of the telegraph. "Free and honest elections" are the first essential condition of nation al life. The need of the develop ment of the existing law providing a federal supervision of congressional elections, as suggested in the last annual message, has manifest' d it self in man parts of the country, The constitutionalitv of such legisla tion h:i3 been affirmed ; its probable effectiveness is evidenced by the op position t'j it. It has been denounced as of a new exercise of federal power and invasion of state rights. Noth ing could be further from the truth. Congress has already provided for supervisors of congressional elections. The same law provides for the ap pointment of deputy United States marshals to support the supervisors and arrest violators of election laws. The present election law, in the opinion of the president, stops just short of effectiveness, for it surrend ers to the local authorities all con trol over the certification which es tablishes the prima facie right to a seat iu the house of representatives. This defect should be cured. Equali ty of representation and purity of the elections must be maintained, or everything that is valuable in our sys tem of government is lost. Such a law should be absolutely non-partisan and impartial. In conclusion, he says: "I venture to again remind you that the brief time remaining for the consideration of the important legis lation awaiting your consideration off ers no margin for waste. If the present duty is discharged with dili gence, fidelity and courage, the work of the 51 st congress may be confi dently submitted to the considerate judgment of the people. Ladles, rough hands are a horror. B.ilhe them well at night iu Johnson's Anodyne Liniment. It is now an absolute certainty that no backward steps will be taken by the republicans during this session of congress. The cry is "forward, for ward, "and the marching will be done to the same old party music that has led the party to its greatest triumphs in the past, which will be repeated in the future, just as certain as intelli gence always in the course of time gets the best of ignorance. The re publicans are still in control of both branches of congress, and republican ideas will dominate all the legislation passed between this and the 4th day of next March, and in spit of dem ocratic threats, howls and piteous ap peals the original republican program, mapped out long before the elections, is to be carried out to the letter. Mrs. Harrison has gone on the long deferred visit to her old Indian apolis home. She would have gone several weeks ago, but the president wished her to stay and take part in the reception tendered to the Brazilian naval officers who came here to pre sent this government with a gold med al for its timely action in recognizing the young Brazilian republic. The reception took place at the White House Friday night, and was a very brilliant affair. To-night, Secretary Tracy entertains the visitors, aud to morrow they start for home, uot be ing able to stand the cold of our cli mate at this season.

Harrington of Bradford, Pent)., died on Saturday last in his "2nd year. Mr. Harrington was a musical director and composer of wide reputation a lead er in the choir of the Bradfotd Methodist church for ten years, an honorable citi zen and a conscientious Christian. He leaves a wife, two daughters and two sons. He was formerly a resident of St. Johnsbury and the remains will be brought to that place in the spring. The greatest sufferers in the world are women; their delicate organizations being particularly sus ceptible to derangement and disease. Dr. Kenedy's Favorite Remedy of Rondout, N.
