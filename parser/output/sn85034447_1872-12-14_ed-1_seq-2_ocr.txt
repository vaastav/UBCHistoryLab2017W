Vto say the least of it, a very deplorable one ; and the moans by which our sister State haB been traduced is certainly with out a parallel. Judge Durell's coup d'Etat, in supplanting the civil authorities of that State, by making a requisition on the Uni ted States Marshal for Federal troops, to take forcible possession of Mechanics' In stitute at midnight, to prevent the meeting of the Lgislativu body, that had boen law fully called together by a proclamation of the Executive, is cortainly an unprecedent ed event in tho history of our Government. Not only that, but tho danger of this high handed proceeding in the" future, is ono to he feared. The action of Judge Durell, in the case of Kellogg vs. Wnrmoth (out of which the muddle originated) is now before the Supreme Court of the United States; and should tho action ol Judge Dnrell be fustnined by that high tribunal, and the pre cedent in such cases bo established, wo may expect a repetition of such in the futnre i which is certainly calculated to oxcite the fears of the citizens of this Government. If euch a proceeding can be carried out suc cessfully in the State of Louisiana, there is no reason why the same proceedings cannot bu carried out in all the States of this Amer ican Union. Judge Durell bases his action, in tue case referred to, ou a law of Congress; und if the law justifies his action in the pre mises, the Constitution of the United Status is a myth, and the boasted right of an Amer ican citizen is a humbug. We can under stand, to sumo extent, why martial law be comes a military necessity in time of War why the military make the civil authorities subordinate thereto ; but we cannot under stand how a Judge on the beuch, in a time of profound peace, can assume the position of dictator, and resort to such arbitrary measures, usurping tho powers of such a dan gerous character, as did Judge Durell, when ho ordered tho United States troops to take possession of tho Capitol of Louisiana— thus virtually overthrowing the State Go vernment, ur at least making an apparent effort in that direction. Whether he intend ed each to bo the result, or not, it presents that appearance to a "Looker-on in Vienna." The action of Judge Durell, in this case, is, doohtlesB, a dangerous proceeding, and evi dently shows an evil tendency ; for if a Federal Judge can call to his assistance the national bayonet, and subvert a State and dethrone its officers, and piece the crowns upon the heads of those of his choice, then we ore inclined to believe that the emblem atical purity of tho ermine robe, and the dignity formerly attached to the wearer, is fust disappearing. We hope, however, that right will triumph, uni that the people of Louisiana will soon sea it verified. We cannot believe that the Supreme Court of the United States will sustain Judgo Durell's unscrupulous con duct. We have more confidence in that tri bunal than to think its decisions would fa vor such a proceeding. and in Sho at ious of tery, sun by ther, a felt was and Cooper's Monstev Caravan. - Magnolia "wili bo visited on Thnradny, tho 19th inst, by'tho above collossul amuse ment enterprise—said to bo among the larg est ol our traveling Exhibitions.

The Exhibitions are given under two mammoth Tents- -one for the Menage rie and MuBonra, the other for tho Circus, while one ticket admits the bolder to both tonte without extra charge.

OBITUARY. Mr*. Nttncy Gibson died in Mag nolia, Miss., on tho 19th of November, 1872, of pulmonary consumption, after an illness of six months. I Brst became eeqainted with the subject of this memoir, Nauey Buiborn, in Jack son, ha. she there became a pupil of mine, about tho year 1849—then about twolve years of age. My recollections of her child hood are only pleasant, but no marked fea tures of character are recollected. She did not remain long at school, and I saw no more of her for a number of years. When f met her in Magnolia, in 1872, .she soon reminded me of our former relations of teacher and pupil. In the meantime she had married Dr. W. N. Sandell, with whom she lived about seven years. James San dell, now living in Magnolia, was the fruit of this marriage. Ur. Sandell died in 1859. She was married to Mr. C. C. Gibson in tho year 18G0. She 1ms left him three children—two daughters and a son. Soon after her marriage to I)r. Sandell, they both sought the communion of the peo ple of God, and united with the Church in 1857. From that time until her death she lived a consistent Christian life, in all her outward deportment. From her own state ment, however, she wns not always happy in religion. Tho fervency of her piety aba ted, and when she was taken sick and the thoughts of death came with continued ill ness, she found herself uuprepared for it. She clung to life on this account, and also because her surroundings in life wero desira ble— a husband ever attentive to her wish es, four interesting children, devoted friends, with home comforts and increasing wealth. She looked forward to many years of pros perity and pleasuntness in this life. When, however, she felt the progress of diseuse and declining strength, she turned her thoughts to God and heaven, and began that self examination and prayer which re sulted in victory over tho world and sin, and brought a peaceful, hopeful death. She suffered from loss of sleep from con stant coughing, and, toward tho last, from the difficulty of breathing ; but I never heard her complain. Shu said, at one time, to a friend : bound to die, and there is no help for it ! '' and burst into tears. In my lost conversa tion with har, I found her ready to depart* free from fear and doubt, and, in faith, wait ing the call of the llodeeraer. When, at one time, her friends were weeping in her room, she said : don't weep for me;" stating that she had to die, and that she was ready to go. She did not talk much—sho could not, for cough ing. Slowly and constantly she sank, al most imperceptibly, as the sun declines. She was rational until she breathed her last, IS Such Just think of it I I am or What is the matter?— At and .clasping her hands, she exclaimed twice, in alow whisper. 11 Heaven, sweet heaven." Sho died on the 19th of November, 1872, at 8 o'clock, surrounded by watchful, anx ious friends. At 3 o'clock, on tho afternoon of the21st of November, a numerous concourse of friends followed hcr romains to the Ceme tery, half mile west of Magnolia, and ns the sun slewly declined in brightness, softened by Autumn's sombre hues, we laid her re mains in quietness to rest, until the Rosur recliou morn ; but we sorrow not as those who have no hope. Mrs. Gibson filled the places of wife, mo ther, friend, Christian ; and 1 never heard a complaint made against her, or an unkind word spoken of her. Patient in suffering, unwilling to bo troublesome to any one, she felt unpleasant at the thought that sho could render no service in her illness, but was dependent upon others. She often ex pressed her thankfulness to her husband and otlieis, for their attentions. It is some and a of of in the its or of times a pleasant tiling to die, and always pleasant to think that 11 death is the gate to Pastor. / endless joy."
