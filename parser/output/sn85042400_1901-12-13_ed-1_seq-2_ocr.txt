Senator Mitchell haa among other bill Introduced In congress one t ex clude Ftllrlno frvvm the rntted State. Just what haa prompted the senator to father this measure Is not at pres ent clear. There has been no demand upon the part of the people of Ore-ron for such a measure, and there certain ly can b no apprehension of any geat number of Filipln coming to this country- Aside from the fact that we are not In any manner threatened hy an inva- j slon of cheap labor from the Philip pines there is another and higher rea son hy such legislation is ill-advised j We have by our own act auvd proprietorship of the rhillpplne Isl nnd. We have for th- rast three years been endeavoring persuade the Intelligent Fi ll In that our pres ence In the islands were for the pur pose of giving to them a measure ,.f liberty of which they have long dream ed, while our army has been endeav oring to subjugate the half-civlliied portion of the people of the Islands and compel them to accept the sover eignty of the I'niled States It is repugnant to the American spirit of justice and fairness to make these peopl subjuct to our law and at the aame time say to them they are debarred from entering the confines of the United States. It is a pr .posi tion which we feel will not meet with the approval of congress. It Is exclu sion (tone to seed, and has none of the elements behind It which have caused the demand for restrictive laws against the flood of Chinese which threatened the welfare of thousands of our labor ing people- Let us look the Philippine question .. a..

Citizens Union candidate for Mayor I and the Republican candidate f-r Treasurer were both men of integrity, j business ability and associated wi.h j the growth and ley. l -i ment of the j city. Koth had b-eti honoied i.y the citizens of Astoria and by no ;u t of j their own had they forfeit-d the i",n fidence bestoweJ in them. They lad administered the affair of ih-lr re pective office with atifaetion to their constituents and to the best in terest of :h? city. Rut they had each served two consecutive terms Mid their personal popularity could no iv-r-crme the prejudice of the American voter against third terms To this fact may r? attributed In a gra. de gree the defeat of those to o g-n' ! incn. Immediately after th- big milroad consolidation was completed th-rt- was an advance In the freight rates on Khlngles to the F-ast -.- hi' h thr-atcned to scrlous-ly interf'-ie with the sol s of Pacific ''oast mill In that market. Since the agitation on the part of the Northwest Htat-a to pr--vent :he com bine from becoming operative the old rate hs been restored, nnd It Is cafe to say that the real object of tlo com bine will now be k-pt in the back ground until the pris'-nt agltaUon has passed and the great mardi-ulai '. be hind thin gigantic enterprise feel as sured they have a fr-e hand to b-vy whatever tribute they may d -Hire on the traffic tributary to their roads It Is known by government nfrklals, ih.vs the Chicago Inter Ocean, that Mie Northern tVcuiluc Company Is only the beginning of the .h.-w M nwn iiil ll'll rave In mini.

For the tlrst time in twenty a s railroads entering southern territory are now moving cotton on ilat cais. This Is brought about by the groat scarcity In freight cai-s. The pivsent unexampled prosperity has proven too much for even our magnificent tall rad facilities, which present unite a different picture to that of mile after mile of empty freight cars stan l lug Idle on side tracks during the never-to-be-forgotten days ot Ivmo- era tic rule.
