Ai the white settlements have crowded the borders of the reservations the Indians have sometimes contended ,and sometimes, against their will, have been transferred to other hunting grounds, from which they have again been dislodged whenever their new-found homes have been desired by adventurers and settlers. These removals, and the frontier collisions ot WMnV, Hiov linvx nftnn been preceded. hfivd led to freouent and disas- mno rrniflit-ts hetween the races It Is profitless to discuss here which of them has been chiefly responsible for the distur bances whose recital occupies so large a space upon the pages ot our History We have to deal with the appalling fact that r.miirh thousands ot lives nave Deen saun- fioed .. and hundreds of millions of dollars expended in the attempt '- to solve the Indian problem, it has ' until within the past few ' yearn seemed scarcely nearer a solution than it was half a century ago. But the t-nvst-nmpnt. tins' heen Cautiously but steadily feeling its way to the adoption of a policy wnicn nas aireauy pruunceu giumy ing results, and which, in my judgment, is jiKeiy, u uongressano uie juwumc auwiu in ita support, to relieve us from the diffl- culties which have hitherto beset us. Far . the success of the ellorts now be ing made to introdnce among the Indians the customs and pursuits : of civilized life, and gradually to absorb ' them into a imass of our citizens, sharing ' . their rights and holding Uiem to tlieir re tmnnsihf lities. there is imperative need foi "' legislative action JMy suggestion in that regard will be chiefly such as have been al ready called to the attention of Congress and have received to some extent its con sideration. , First I recommend the nassacre of an act - making the laws of the various States and . Territories applicable to the Indian reserva ,v'' tions within their borders, and extending : the portion or the Indian Territory not oe oiinied bv the five civilized tribes. The , Indian should receive the protection of the law, lie siiouiu tie anowcu to niuiuiain in ' : court his rieht of person and property. He has repeatedly hegged for this privilege. Its in his r)rorress toward civilization. Second Of euen greater importance is a . ' measure, which has been frequently recom mended by my predecessors in ollice, and in furtkerance of which several bills have Iuaii from time to time introduced in both hones of Congress. The enactment ot a gen eral law permitting allotment in severalty, to such Indians at least as deserve . it. . of ft reasonable quantity of : land secured to thciu by patent, and for their own protection, made ..- innltenaoie ior twenty or tweniy-nve years, is demanded for their present welfare and " their permanent advancement. In return for such considerate action on the "part of tlie uovcrnmeni tnere is reason to ueucve that the Indians, in large numbers, would be persuaded to sever their tribal relations ' and to engage at once in agricultural pur suits. Many of them realize the fact that their hunting days are over and that it is now for their best interests to conform "" their manner ef life to the new order of things, and by no greater inducement than the assurance of a permanent title to the Boil can they be led to engage in the occu pation of tilling it. The well-attested re ports of their increasing interest in husbandry justify the hope and belief that the enactment of such a statue as I recommend would be at once attended with gratifying results. A resort to the allotment system would - have a direct and powerful influence in dis- solving the tribal bond which is so promi nent a feature of savage lite and which tends to strongly to perpetuate it. Third I advise a liberal appropriation for the support of Indian schools be cause of my confident belief that a course is consistent with nit wihmi eiiiiiiiui cvni (Minriiif. mn iuni uncultured' Indian tribes, mere is re ported to be a general and argent desire on for the education of their children. It is unfortunate in view of this fact that during the past year the means which hav been tl tne conuuaiiu ui iiir niienor impair ment for the purpose of Indian instruction have proved to be utterly inadequate. The success of the schools which are in operation in Hampton, Carlisle and VnrrL Grove should not onlv encouraire a more generous provision for the support of tlur institutions, nut snouia promote the establishment of others of similar character. Thev are doubtlesa much more potent for Rood tuan day acnooi upnu inc reservation, as the pupils are alf ogcihpr separated from the surroundings of savage life, and are brought into constant contact with civilization. There are many other phases of this subject which are of great interest, but which cannot be included within becoming limits of this communication. Thpy are disrumed ably in the reports of the fcwretary of the Inte rior and the Commissioner of Indian Af fairs. OS MOKUOKlklf.

EDUCATION. Although our system of government does not contemplate that a nation should provide. or sup port a svstem of education of our people, no measures calculated to promote the general intelligence and vlrtuo upon which the prosperity 01 our nmiiiu' tinns so irrentlv depends, have ever been ro garded with iiulittcrcnce by Congress or tho Executive. A large port of the public domain has been from time to time devoted to the nrnmntion of education. There is now special reason why by setting apart the proceeds ot its sales of public lands or by some other course, the Government should aid the work of educutlon. Many who now exercise the right of aiitrerncn nra unable to read the ballot which they cast, who havo just emerged from a condition of slavery, and who sud denly devolved the responsibilities of citi zens. J.ne country niosc laipuyeriaiieu ujr the war. I have been pleased to lcarn'from the report of the Commissioner of Education, that ' there has lately been a considerable increase ot in terest and effort for their, instruction but all that can be done by local legislation and private generosity should be supple mented bv such aid as can be constitution ally afforded bv tho National Government I would suerirest that if anv fund be desii?' nated to this purpose it may be wisely dis tributed in different States, according to t.ha ratio of illiteracy, as bv that means those localities which are more in need of such assistance will reap the special benelits. ON AGRICULTURE. The report of the Commissioner of Agrl culturd exhibits the results of experiments in which she Department has been encaged during the past year, and makes important suggestions in reference to the ugrlcultural department of tho country. The steady increase of our population and the consequent addition to the number .....

The Commissioner's suggestions to urge its capacity for greater useluincss deserves attention, as i more and more commends itself to the in terests which it was created to promote ON PENSIONS. It appears from the report of the Com missioner of Pensions that since 1800, $789,000 original claims have been filed; $150,949 of these have been allowed and inscribed on the pension roll; $72,539 have been reiected and abandoned, beinc thirteen per cent, of the whole number of -niilA,l n'Vmva nnn tirtU. rtnrwlinfr for settlement $305,575 original pension claims, $227,010 of which were filed prior to July 1st. 1880. These when al lowed, will involve the payment of arrears from the date of discharse. !in case of any valid claim, and from the date of death or termination of a prior richt in all other cases. From all the data obtainable it is estimated that 15 per cent, of the number of claims now pending will be rejected or abandoned. This would show a probable rejection of 3,404 cases and the probable ad mission of about 193,000 cases, all of which involve the payment ot arrears or pen. sion. With the present force em. ployed, tho number of adjudications remaining the same and no new business intervening, this number of claims (193,000) could be acted on in a period of six years, and taking January 1, 1884, as a near period from which to estimate in each case an average amount of arrears, it is found that every case allowed would require for tlie first payment upon it the sum of $2,300, multiplying this amount by tlm whole number ot probable admissions cives $250,000 as the sum required for the first payment, this repre sents the sum which must be paid npon claims which were filed before July 1, l".sl, aim are now peuuing uuu en titled to the benelits of the arrears act, !'-om tli'' umouiit, $i'.r0,000,0()0, mny be ,,. ,l,i,.teil from 10.000.000 to $15,000,000 for eases where the claimant dying, there is no nervnii who under the law, would he entitled tn tlie pension, leiivine say $235,000,000 as His iirnhahle amount to bo paid. In these estimates no account has been taken of the i.'..r0 tiled mice Juno 30, 1880, and now pending which must receive attention as current business, uui wmcu uura nut in volve the payment of any arrears beyond the date of the filing of the same. Of this number It is estimated that eighty-six per sons will bo allowed, as nas neen siaiea, with the present force of the Pension Bureau, 075 clerks. It is es timated that it will take six years to dispose of the claims now pending. It is stated by tho Commissioner of Tensions that by an addition of 250 clerks, increasing U1C ttllJUUll.Sl.lllK

Aside from the consideration of justice which may be urgedfor a speedy settlement of the claims on the files of the Tension Otllce. It is now less important on the score of economy, inasmuch as luny one third of the clerical fores of the otllce i now wholly orcnplert in civine attention to the mrrrgnoiiduiice with thousands of claim .ants, whose cases have been on tiles lor the past eighteen yenrs. The fsi-t that a sum so enormous llllisi lie t-AiiTiun.-u hi ui" wuv eminent tp meet the demands for the ar rears of pensions is an admonition to iVinsn-u und the Executive to cive cautions consideration to any similar pro ject in the future. Tlie great temptation to the presentation or uctitmus claims out-red by the fact that the average snin obtained upon each application is $1 ,.'. leads me to suggest the propriety of making some special legislation ior preTeniauon ui irnuu ISTItKAL mriOVKMIKTS. I advise an appropriation for tach inter nal improvements as the wisdom of Con gress may deem to be of publie importance. The necessity of improving the navigation of the Mississippi river justifies a sjiecial allusion to that subject.

Kecond, a limita tion of maximum ago at which an applicant can enter scrvico, whereby -all men In the midst of lite, or older, are. with some exceptions, rigidly oxcludcd; third, a retiring allowance on going out of office. These ' three element are as important -factors . i- 41... l.lm .. ..u ll,a nll....o Ol tllU UOUiriU HUT UI uw vi.it.Dy Ti nlindnulu Ilium from 1 fill F.nidlsh HVS torn would effect a most radical change In its theory and practice. The avowed purpose of that system is to induce the ed seated young men of the country to devote their lives to public employment, by on as surance that having once entered upon it tuey.'necd never'lcavo it and that after! volun tary retirement they shall be the recipients of an annual pension. That this system as an entirety has proved very successful in Great Britain, and seems to be generally conceded even by those who once opposed its adoption. To a statute which should incorporate all of its essential features I should feel bound to give my approval, but whether it would be for the best inter ests of the public to fix upon it as on expe dient for immediate and extensive applica tion, which embraces certain features of the English systems, but. excludes or ignores others of equal importanoe, may be seriously doubted even by those who are impressed, as I am myself, with the grave Importance of correcting the evils which heroin present the mothods of appoint ment. If. for example, the Knulisu rule which shuts out persons above the age of twenty-five years from a large number of employments is not to De moue an essential part of our own system, it is ques tionable whether the attainment of the highest number of marks at a competitive examination should bo a criterion by which all applications for appoint ment should be put to test, and under similar conditions it may also be a question whether the admission to the service should be strictly limited to its lowest ranks. There arc very many char acteristics which go to make amodcl servant; prominent among thesa are probity, industry, good sense, good habits, good temper, patience, order, courtesy, tact, self-reliance and manly deference to superiar officers and manly consideration for inferiors. The absence of those traits is not supplied by wide knowledge- of hooks or bv ' nromntitudo in 'answerinu questions, or by any other quality likely to De brought to light by a competitive exam amination. To make a success in such a contest, therefore, an indespensable condi tion of public employment would very likely result in the practical extension of the older applicants, even though they might possess ;qualitictions;far supe rior to their younger and more bnTiant competitors. These suggestions mu- not be regarded as evidence of any spirit oi' op position to the competitive plan which has been to some ex tent successfully employed ulready, and which may hereafter vindicate the claim of its most earnest supporters. Hut it ought to be seriously considered whether the application ot some educational stanaaru to persons of mature years and to young men fresh from school and college would not likely result in more intellectual pro ficiency above other qualities of equal or sreatcr importance. Another feature of the proposed system is the selec tion, by promotion, of all officers of the Government, above lowest crades. except such as would fairly be recarded as exponents of the policy ot tlie executive ana tne princi ples of the dominant party to aflbrd en couraccmcnt to the faithful public servants by exercising in their minds the hope of promotion, n tney are iounu to merit it, is " much to be desired, ilut would it be wise to adopt a rnie so risrid as to permit no other manner of supplying the intermediate wants of the service, mere are many persons wuo 1111 subordinate positions with great credit, but lack those qualities which are so requisite for the higher posts of duty, and because the mode - of thought, and action of one whose prcsenco in a gov crmcntal bureau has been long continued are often so cramped by routine procedure, as almost to disqualify him from instituting changes required by the public interests. An infusion or new biooa iroiu tune to time into tho middle ranks of the service might be very beneficial In its results, i he suhiect under discusion is one of grave importance. The evils which are complained of cannot be eradicated st once; the work must be grad ual. The present Kngllsh system is a growth of years and was not crested by a single stroae ot tne executive or oi legislative action. Its beginnings are found in an order in Council and at a time when resort had been had to competitive exam inations as an experiment mnch more ex tensively than has yet been the case in this country. A select committee of the House of Commons made a report lo tlmt house which declaring its approval of the competitor's plan and deprecated, nevertheless, any precipitancy in its gen-' iwiptsI srtontinn s ureiy to endorser U3 ultimate success. It may be that before we confine ourselves with Important the question, in the bounds orst.itunry enactments sa may await me result oi lunner inquiry una oi ex periment, the submission or a I .on ion of the nominations to a Central Hoard of Kxnminers, selected solely for treating the qualifications of applicants it mav. perhaps, without ressrt to die com- Miitirs test, put an end to the mischief which auenus tne present system of appointments. and it may ba feasible to vest In snch a board a wide discretion to ascertain the characteristics and attainments of candi dates, in the particular which I have al ready referred to, as being the less imjior. tsnt tnan mere intellectual - at tainments. If Congress should deem it advisable , at the present session to establish a competitive test for the admission ot service, no doubt snch as bavs been suggested I shall not deter from giving the measure my earnest support, and I earn estly recommend that should this ba a Isilure to pass any otner act upon mis sub ject, that an appropriation or -",i"A per year may tx male ior tne enioroeinent oi section 1753 of the revised statutes.

What is the inioiiHon of the constitution in its specifica tions of inability to dissharge the powers and duties ot said omce, as one oi mu -tingenciesof which sails the Vice-President to the exercise of the President's functions? Is the inability limited in nature to long continued intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader import? What must be its extent and duration? How must its existence be established? Has the President, whose inability is the subject of inquiry, any voice in determining whether or not it exists, or is the de cision or that momentous and delicate question confined to tho Vice-President, or is it contemplated by the constitution that Congress should provide by law pre cisely .what should constitute inability, and how, and by what tribunal authority it should be asccrtumcd u tne in nl.il.lv nrnves to be tcm porary in its nature, and dur ring its continuance the Vice-President lawfully exercise tho functions of the Kx ecutive?
