Communication relating to news and edl- atlonal legls- the aim of that policy, dictated by the land own era and farmers, la being reached by the constantly increasing price of meat, since consumers are so largely restricted to the German supply. The Increase of town population on account of Industrialism has been enormous at the same time that the foreign meat supply has been cut off. The result, forcing the wholesale price of meats In penalty for accepting rebates. In addi tion to the heavy costs of litigation, will at least tend to make Its viola tions of the law a losing game. Re- brm has gone farther than may be generally appreciated when It has be come good policy, from a purely finan cial standpoint, to obey rather than violate the law forbidding acceptance of rebate discriminations. No more signal vindication could be had of the wisdom and efficiency of the Roosevelt movement, however captious critics and partisan detract ors may have sought during the prog ress of the contest to belittle and mis represent It. Much, indeed, remains to be done to confirm and complete the reform, but the substantial charac ter of Its results Is already too obvious to be gainsaid. tortaTVler alVoui 1 be "dressed" Omaha Germany to almost double what it IS Uee, Kditoriai Department. jn France, Belgium, England and REMITTANCES. . , . , Remit by draft, express or postal order spain( amounts to an Intolerable op- paynble to The Bee Publishing company. . ,.,, . wn na only 2-cent stamps received as payment of presslon or consumers as wen as a mall accounts.

BETTER BV1LDWQS. The destruction by fire of a large warehouse at Council Bluffs with Its contents again directs the attention of our business men to the need of better buildings. The construction that has been under way In Omaha during the last three years has for the most part been of a type very much Improved over that of the earlier structures. Some of the buildings are of absolutely fireproof materials, while some of the others, nolably the large warehouses, have been built along the approved plans for "slow burning." This advance In the substantial char acter of the constructive methods Is encouraging, but it is not enough. Omaha's building ordinance Is still de fective In many regards and falls to secure the full advantage that should be enjoyed by a city of Omaha's Im portance. Successive building inspec tors have frequently pointed out the deficiencies in the law, but as yet no serious effort has been made to remedy the defects. A new building ordinance is one of Omaha's Immediate needs, and If the present city council can only divert Its attention from street car transfers long enough to give consid eration to the needs of the city along this line. It will perform at least one appreciated service to the people who elected It. The difference of opinion between the sheriff and the county commission ers regarding pay for care and main tenance of prisoners in the county Jail emphasizes the need of an amendment to the statute governing the sheriff's office. The present legislature should enact some sort of law that will put on a definite basis the relations be tween the sheriff's office and the county board and do away with such disputes as have been In progress in Douglas county ior nearly a year and now likely to be tested In the court. If the law is made clear on thlspoint It will save a great deal of bickering and misunder standing. An Increase of $GU,uuO,000 in the preferred stock of the Great Northern proves that railroads are no longer built in the northwest on county and township subsidies. If It be desirable for railroads to Issue passes to army officers and their wives, the law should so declare. The exceptions should not be left to the. will of the railroad manager. Jlm long as dressed meat la no higher In France than In the United States the "reciprocity" Idea will not be as popular In Paris as in Berlin, where meat sella for practically twice as much. With fines of $150,000 for receiving rebates stockholders of the American Sugar company and Brooklyn Cooper age, company may feel impelled to insist upon the dancers paying the fiddler. i tlons for the cotton and grain regions and the fraction that may reach New York will travel by a circuitous route, requiring time. In short, stock specu lators who have been gambling on the chance of a substantial lift from the treasury have missed their play. The simple truth is that the call Interest rate which has been made to play such fantastic antics in the east ern speculative centers has been In large part a gambling rate, and the quotation record does not at all repre sent the real rate paid for money for mercantile and other legitimate uses. The latter." although much higher than usual, has all the time been by no means ominous or disastrous. Since actual business thus so far disregards the sensational call rate of the stock gamblers, the secretary of the treasury also has been wise in re fusing to be startled by It, especially as there Is ground to suspect that it has been manipulated for the express purpose of controlling his distribution of treasury deposits. The recommendation of Secretary Galusha that the funds appropriated for the support of the state Institutions be retained In the state treasury' and that purchases of supplies be made in bulk and not In detail will recommend Itself aa a practical measure of econ omy. It Is no reflection on the man agement of the several . Institutions that this change should be made, but it must be patent to any careful observer that a great deal of the present ex pense of maintaining the state educa tional and charitable undertakings can be cut off by a reform In methods.

FRASCICO- RKASO. Why tk Japanese Are Coasldere Objectionable to the Coast. Ban FTanclaco Chronicle. It Is unfortunate that the eastern people cannot, or will not, understand tha attl- ude of the people of this coast toward Japan. During their recent war the sym pathy of our people with Japan was uni versal and outspoken, being based on the outrageous conduct of the coalition headed by Russia In robbing Japan of the fruits of Its victory In ISM and then braxenly ap propriating them to themselves. This friendly International feeUng has never abated, although we here recognize Japan as a deadly commercial competitor which will rapidly supersede us In Asiatic com merce. We admire and respect Japan as the most vigorous exponent of oriental civ. Illiatlon. The objection of our people Is simply to the establishment of oriental forms of civilization In the United States. We par ticularly obpect to a Japanese invasion, be cause, as the Japanese are most virile of oriental peoples, their lodgment on our shores la by so much the more danger ous. e recognise that Asiatic peoples are entitled to maintain such forms of civiliza tion nnd such a standard of life as they prefer In their own country and to exclude, If they so desire, and as they certainly did once desire, the people of western coun- rles. So far as we are concerned they are quite welcome, as they have the right, under the existing treaties, to exclude all American manual workers from Japan. We claim the same right, and demand that It be exercised. Nothing oan create an un friendly feeling among us toward Japan except an effort to push Its people Into our country against our wish. Just as our own Commodore Perry a half century ago forced an entrance Into Japan against the resist ance of the Japanese. There was no Justi fication for that except- the conduct of Japanese pirates toward the crews of wrecked American ships. Any nation has a right to demand of any other nation hos pitality to shipwrecked sailors. To the ex tent of securing that only was our Intru sion Into Japan Justified. But that, was a long time ago. There Is no longer any fear of any Injury which a government can pre vent to the subjects of either nation law fully within the Jurisdiction of the other. The Japanese In San FTanclsco are pro tected by the authorities and by public ROIXD ABOIT HEW YORK. m Ripples Oa the tarrent of Life la the Metropolis. The limit of aldcrmanlc pride and patience has been reached In Greater New York and an edict la about to Issue commanding mule power street cars to get off the earth In that locality. Some sections of the big town are as Impervious to modern ways as the community Is to political re form, and an antique mule power street car system resists all persuasion. Only about 112 rrtlles of horse car lines now remain In the country, and ninety-two miles of tha total are In Manhattan, the remandrr di vided between Chit ago, San Francisco and Nebraska City. New York aldermen are determined to modernise this eyesore, even if It Is necessary to shoot the Inoffensive mules. The water dearth In Brooklyn Is to be met by tapping the water that underlies the city and Long Island In vast quanti ties, at depths ranging from 175 to 1,600 feet. The availability of this underground sup ply has been demonstrated by Silas W. Tltua. who has been able to yet a dally yield of g.000,000 gallons. The Brooklyn water department was loth to admit the possibility of such a solution of the press ing local problem, but Its officials were finally prodded Into authorizing the experi ment. They Anally agreed to pay Mr. Titus 40 a million gallons for the pro duction In excess of S.000,000 gallons a day. The officials were of the opinion that he could not get over 4,000,000 a day, and under the terms believed the city could obtain a little water free. The Brooklyn Ragle, which was an early advocate of the Titus project, declares that water has been produced In such, quantities as to Insure a happy solution of the problem. The water Is pure and absolutely free from the possi bility of contamination. The agreement with Mr. Titus Is that he shall receive HO for every million gallons over 5.000,000 for four months, and 130 per million for two years thereafter. After that he agrees to turn his entire plant, consisting of pumps, air compressors, pipes, houses and utensils. over to the city wtlhout asking a dollar for It. It is believed that during the two years Mr. Titus will get a water supply of from 20,000,000 to 25,000,000 gallons per day which means an income of more than J300, 000 a year.

Starnlflcant Development of the West nd Northwest. Chicago Chronicle. When the Union Pacific railroad was completed with government assistance, it was almost universally held that the en terprise would not be duplicated within the memory of living men. The barrenness of the country between the Missouri river and the Pacific coast. It was said, was a barrier to further rail road building. The conquest of the RocVy mountains a second time was declared to be all but Impossible. There was no other pass through which another road could cross the mountains. Today there are six transcontinental lines. Three years hence perhaps even sooner there will be seven. The Pacific extension of the Chicago, Milwaukee and Bt. Paul railroad will be the new link of steel to bind the western coast of the country to the lands on the hither side of the Mis souri. The enterprise Is already assured of successful completion. The lands which were pronounced bar ren forty years ago have blossomed as the rose. The passes of the mountains have been found. Throughout the entire route of the St. Paul ex tendon a rich and de veloped country awaits the advent of the locomotive. Engineering difficulties have been met and overcome. The road Is cer tain to be on a paying basis from the first. It is significant of the development of the great northwest that the Chicago, Mll- of Troubles of the Oil Senator. Philadelphia Press.

" "I hear a great deal about the wicked ness of New Tork men, their Infidelity and their recklessness In general," said the woman who deals In real estate, "but I see a bit of contradictory evidence here that I never saw anywhere else, and I have done business in nearly every large city In tl)ls country and some in Europe.

Hamilton place and One hundred and Thirty-eight street, for $117,500, when the property could have been bought for not more than $M).fl09. It Is not un likely criminal proceedings will follow. Judson Ijawson brought the matter up at a meeting of the West End association as an Illustration of the notoriously Inefficient system of condemnation proceedings in vogue.

It signifies that there Is business and possibilities for both rods for three roads, indeed, since the Great Northern Is no great distance to the north of the St. Paul extension. The enterprise means much or the Pa cific coast, more for the Pugft sound re gion and most for Chicago. A direct line to the northwest will undoubtedly develop trade not only with the Pacific coast, but with the orient. The assurance Is con firmed by the known energy, activity and proirressiveness of the St. Paul manage ment, which will Undoubtedly carry to the Pacific coast the policy of enlightened enterprise which has placed It among the first of America's great railroad systems. The new line to the coast signifies prog ress for the whole middle west. Danib Things (is Wrong. Baltimore American.

RECONCILED POPIXIST. Joy of Tibbies Over the "Conversion of Roosevelt." New York World. Mr. Bryan reude President Roosevelt's message with mixed emotions. He praises here, and he condemns there. But If Mr. Bryan had his way there would be a fed eral law requiring the date to be stamped on every can of Bryanism, with penalties for Rooseveltlan tampering with the label. There Is nothing half-hearted, however, about Thomas Tibbies, leader of the wMern populists and populist candi date for vice president In 1P0I. He wel comes Mr. Roosevelt with open arms as "a splendid populist," and his Joy overflows In paneSTrtcs. Does Mr. Roosevelt favor placing all the trade risk on the employer and protest against "that Judge-made law known as the negligence of a fellow-servant?' Populists have always denounced It, says the happy Tibbies. Does Mr. Roosevelt protest against the flagrant abuses of the Injunction business, especially lu labor troubles? The first movement against government by Injunc tion," Tibbies points out, "was taken In a Nebraska populist state convention when good old Mr. Bnyder, a preacher, Intro duced a resolution denouncing It a few day ater the first Injunction of the kind was Issued." Does Mr. Roosevelt hold that the Judges and courts are not above criticism? Tibbies rejoices In his populist stand. Dora the president pronounce tn favor i f an In come and Inheritance tax?

"Times must he mighty hard for second hand book dealers these days," eald tho business man, quoted by the New York Sun. "I never thought about It until a short time ago. whe(n I had occasion to addn lot of books to my library. I do not like glaring new bindings so .1 - thought I would buy aa many of my new stock as possible second-hand, but I found that many of them would cost me more than I would have to pay for the same aufhor's works fresh from the publishers.

The charge that the government's hand ling of magazines and newspapers at tha present second-class rate was responsible for a great 'share of the annual postal def icit was completely overthrown in the course of the hearings recently held In thia cuy. Anuiiionai evinenee in support ox the publishers' contention Is found In the fact, recently mode public through an of ficial report of the postmaster general, that the deficit for 1906 is less by more than lUOO.COO than that of 1905 and this In the face of the steady growth of the pub lishing Industry. It would be exceedingly unwise, from an educational point of view. If from no other, for congress to Increase the tax upon legitimate and high-class pub . Mentions enjoying the present secoml-closs privileges. What Is needed In any. re-, vision to be made Is an Intelligent dis crimination between the legitimate and tha "fake" publications. Whllo the govern ment extends Its aid to rural free delivery of mall, which Is confessedly a money- losing branch of the postal business, and to the many expensive projects of tha Agricultural department, such as seed dis tribution and the maintenance of experi mental stations and farms, ' the talk of economizing by cutting down the postal privileges of ths great publishing Industry Is deserving of no serious consideration by congress.
