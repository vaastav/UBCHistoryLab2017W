I have succeeded In obtaining a copy of the Inaugural of the Governor eleot, F. J. Moses, Jr., wMchJs now In type. The address is ex? pected tobe delivered at two P. M. to-morrow, the hour fixed for the Inauguration, andas the readers of THE NEWS will be anxious to Hear what their new Executive bas to say at the threshold of his administration, I send lt to you in lull : FdloxD-OUixms of the Senate and House of Sepresentatioes : . You nave entered upon the sixth session ot the General Assembly since the establishment of free government In the State of South Carolina. -. Ifcfbould be with us a source of profound gratitude to Divine Providence that you m ;et under auspices that betoken brighter and bet? ter days for the whole people of the State, whose sworn representatives you are. The earth bas rewarded the labors of our husband* men with abundant fruits, while all the varied forms and arts of Industry are being prose? cuted with hopeful energy amid apparently universal peace and order, nnder our happy system of government, which guarantees and maintains liberty regulated by law. We have been mercifully exempt from the great and disastrous fires whlob, during the past year, have swept over BO many portions of our common country, consuming to ashes the garnered wealth of years, and reducing the rich and the poor to the same level of In? digent suffering. Let us endeavor, fellow eli Izaos, to deserve these signal blessings by a faithful and con? scientious discharge of all the important trusta reposed in us by the people. ?/\Ajf\ Ia entering upon the duties of the DlgVofllce with which I have been vested by the gener? ?os favor of my fellow-citizens, my deep aesse of gratitude to them for the honor con erred by their free suffrages ls associated with a painful conviction of the grave re ipanslbllity which has been imposed upon me by their choice. I will endeavor to discharge my whole duty to the whole people of the State. To this end I invoke the considerate Judgment and active cooperation of every member of the General Assembly, whatever may be his party creed, and the opea aid and assistance of every good citizen ia the Commonwealth of South Giro llna. Wjme I shall not forget that, as a candidate, I represented in my person the Union Repub? lican party, whose beneficent principles are expressed in the doctrine of equal rights and exact justice to all men, now Incorporated In the fundamental law of the State and nation; and while under any and all circumstances my dutyof devotion and fidelity to my party shall i be ever present to my mind, I trust that I may always remember that, as the Chief Mag- . 1 strate of the State, I represent all the people of South Carolina, and that the lines which limit--my zeal for their interests must, in honor, be co-extensive with her boundaries. Standing here to-day lu the august presence of the assembled law-makers of the State, and of this large multitude, with the oath o? office In all its adema sanctity lresh upon my lips, I pledge my best efforts to Insure that during my administration "the Commonwealth shall suffer no detriment." - Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Repr?? sentatives, let us re-dedicate ourselves to the great work and duty of the hour. Let us prove to the world, by the enactment ol just laws and their impartial administration, that the nighest private liberty here 1B consonant with the greatest public good. . Oar people are happy in the possession of a bountiful soil and a genial climate. Here the varied products of temperate and tropic zones . grow side by Bide, while our streams are flash? ing in the sunlight of a perpetual spring. The im;3tjrlal plant, whose fleecy fibres enter into the raiment ot civilized man throughout the ; globe, and whose production presses heavily upon the very balance wheels of the commer? cial exchanges of the world, has here Its na? tive home and most luxuriant growth. Yet the iaoe of the emigrant is turned away from our State, and capital, whloh sets labor in mo? tion and creates the manufactures whloh con? tribute to the comfort and the ?l?vation or man, shrinks back from us, as If the Beals of pestilence were broken, and its vials emptied out-upon this beautiful land of ours. Hence, nearly - three-fourths ot our vast territorial area, embracing not less th au thirty-six thous? and square miles, ile fallow to-day. This disastrous result ls largely due to the fell spirit ot political Intolerance, which has been manifested during the past five years, by the former governing class ia South Caro? lina, who Stil), ia great part, represent the educated intelligence and landed property of S the SUte. That Intolerance, which was at first suc? cessfully directed to destroy the financial credit of the State- Government, both at home and abroad, also proscribed every native and adopted citizen who openly declared himself la accord with the. political sentiments whIch were entertained by the vast majority of the people ot the United States, who have, by the resafe of the recent national campaign, fur nished a most memorable proof of their firm determination that only those who are known to reflect and maintain those political senti? ments shall role ia this republic of ours. Individual proscription r.od habitual de? nunciation of the government, both State and Federal, werf soon followed by armed organ? izations in various sections of the State, whlob, led by bold, bad and designing men, overawed, by their numbers and daring, the law-abiding majority, and scourged and slew many of their fellow-citizens beoause of their political opinions and party affiliation. These barbarous acts ot a minority of the minor party la the State continued, with varying intensity, for a long and dark period ot more tban three years. The government of the State having made Ineffectual attempts to check them, both by earnest appeals to the reason and humanity of those who were re? garded as the political leaders and exponents of the desperate men engaged In them, and by Its available constabulary for oe, finally ap? pealed to the national authority for protection to American citizens from lawless violence within the limits of the State. That appeal, after long delay Incident to procuring the necessary legislation by the Congress of the United States, was effectually responded to, through the Federal courts,'sus tallied bj the military arm of the governmen Aa the result or that Intervention, lor whit our most profound gratitude ls due to tr Government of the United States, many hui d-eds of the persons engaged in those lawlei undertakings, so abhorrent to our free inst tutions and to the civilization of the age, nav been arrested and Imprisoned, under sentenci while many more charged with having bee engaged in them have, through a sense of fee or guilt, fled beyond the borders ol our Stat? Taming away from the recollection of thoa scenes which were so utterly revolting to a trne lovers of liberty, I am happy to ann o une that peace and good order now prevail every where within the State, which seem to be ac companied by a returning aense of Justice, an by a broader spirit ot toleration in the hlthert ruling classes, which famish a better gu?rante tor their continuance than the mere tempe rary presence of the sword or bayonet ca: ever give among a free people. The grand Juries of several counties in th upper part of the Stale, which were the ohle scenes of the armed violence aimed at th vested rights of American citizens, have re cently expressed a becoming contrition, am apparently sincere regret and sorrow, tba this violence should have been permlttei to manifest Itself, unchecked by the local au thoritles in their several counties, and sol emnly pledge those citizens who have here tolore been presumed to have given a qules cent sanction to these atrocities, that hence forth they will actively exert themselves tc main tal u law and order, and will protect, bj foroe ot arms, if necessary, any cltizei whose political rights and personal prlvllegei may be assailed. Aa Governor of this State, and as the pol?tica ally and personal friend of many of those who have been stricken down by this armed violence, and whose memories I wear within my heart of hearts, I welcome this pledge tc which I have referred, and earnestly trust that lt will be speedily and constantly ratified by the conduct of those In whose behalf lt bat been given. The grand Juries have accompanied these gratifying assurances by the Indictment of a large number of persons, chargeable with having been actors in these unholy and crimi? nal combinations. I have been informed by members of your respective houses, who have lived lo the disturbed portions of South Carolina, that this happy change, in the sec? tion referred to, is to some extent due to the fearless action of the Judge of the Sixth Cir? cuit, For this he deserves, and should re? ceive, tbe thanks of our people. Let us indulge the not altogether unwar? ranted hope that the dawn ot a brighter foture baa broken upsn South Carolina, and that the passions which have so long vexed her people with Internecine strife, and the batet which sprung from domestic war, have spent their last red ripples within ber borders. While the exhibition and indulgence of such pas? sions and hates might sometimes enable a political party to win, by them the people of the State mast always lose. I therefore appeal to the men of my own race, in South Carolina, in the common Inter? est of her whole people, to place themselves abreast with the advancing civilization of the age, and cultivate a nobler spirit of toleration, worthy of the anolent renown of theiBtatej. Earner up-ir yon choose-all that you may istly deem honorable in the mouldering tra? itions of our people, and walk with reveren? tial tread near the graves of the brave and de? voted men who, however mistaken they may have been, died willingly la defence of what they believed to be right. But deal more Justly and kindly with onr dark foster brothers of the State. They are your fellow oltlzens, by the constitution and laws ot our common country, and your destiny is bound up with theirs-lor good or evil-in all coming time. Bise above that spirit of sectionalism, which has so long been the dark alain on the escutcheon of oar most distinguished states? men, and which marred tho noble character and narrowed the Intellectual rauge ot the great Virginia senator, ot whom Whittler, the great "Poet of Liberty," has Bald, with kindly severity : "Too honest or too proud to feign, A love he never cherished, Beyond Virginia's border Uno Mts patriot lam perished While others balled In distant skies Our ^eagle's dusky pinion, Be only saw our mountain bird . Stoop o'er the Old Dominion." Let the American citizen feel that wherever may have been the place of his birth, when he enters within our boundaries he will find withins a safa home and hospitable welcome. Thus will oar brethren from the great States of the North be encouraged to dwell among ?B. The men whose skilled industry and ex hanatless eaergles have bonded mighty cities in the remote wilderness will level our forests and replace them with blooming harvest fields, and cover the spots n$w marked by the sad ruins of disastrous war with the enduring monuments of their peaceful and civilizing arts. The magnificent and unfailing water power of our State, which ls now rnnnlngto waste, will then be rapidly utilized, to put in motion thousands of busy spindles and looms, in full view of the fields that are whitened by the plant that supplies the material for the fabric they weave. The hardy yeomanry of Europe-who Beek abroad the liberty and prosperity denied them at home-will also be woad to our shores, and will swell the volume of oar Industrial wealth. I would also appeal to those people of the State, who were formerly the ml lng class, to cultivate and cherish a loyal and devoted sen? timent to the great government of which we form a part, and to revere and worship the flag which represents lt-a government whose mighty arm ls ready to be uplifted la your de? fence, at home and abroad, on land and sea a flag which you cw no longer call the ensign of a power hostile to you. The illustrious soldier who ls now the Chief Magistrate of onr great Republic, and whose magnanimity In peace should make the brave men who op? posed him feel that he deserved to triumph in war, desires to Bee all citizens of our State dwell together lu harmony-In obedience to Just laws ot their own enactment-and he stands prepared to foster by generous en courgement a loyal sentiment ot devotion to our country, wherever lt may make Itself manifest. To those of my fellow-clllzena with whom I am affiliated In political sentiment, and who were pleased to designate me as the candi? date of their choice, and to accord me their suffrages in. the recent election, I desire to say that in all matters of public policy, so far as any effort of mine may avail, I will regard1 the platform which was framed by the repre? sentative body that placed me in nomination as an authoritative exposition of my official dnty, which demands, and shall ever receive, my highest respect. I shall avail myself of the earliest opportu? nity to communicate with yon as to the re? forms and amendments in our system of State Government which I think are contemplated by the spirit and Intention of this platform, by which I hope we will be governed. To those who deemed lt proper to assail me during the canvass with unparalleled acerbity, I would say, In kindly spirit, that the obloquy of their aaaaolta has been met and answered at the ballot-box, and I do not desire to re? vive the recollection of their defeat, save by proving in my public conduct that their re? proaches were undeserved. I trust that lt will not be deemed inappro? priate for me to refer, on an occasion like the I present, to an event which, following rapidly I the official announcement of the election o? the Republican candidates in the State and nation, bas thrown a cloud upon even that splendid triumph. I allude to the death of the Hon. Horace Greeley, which occurred on the evening of the 29th ultimo, and which may be considered as a national calamity. History is but the record ot the lives and deeds of the few men who have been either the benefactors or the scourges of their race. This man was in his sphere illustrious above all his compeers in the service rendered by him to the cause of human rights, during the past quarter of a century. Standing at the head of a great journal, whose pages were disseminated as widely as the English language itself, he did more than any of his contempo? raries to mould the opinions of the represen? tative men of bis generation, and to estab? lish and vindicate the beneficent system ol free government now incorporated. Into the organic law of this nation. Springing from the tolling millions of the people, he never forgot bis origin, but waa always, amid his well deserved wealth and eminence, the outspoken champion of the poor and the oppressed, and of the rights of labor. No man was more uncharitable in speech than he, and never was man more charitable In deed. Possessed of a hardy and rugged honesty which the breath of slander dared not assail, even ia the fierce heat ot a political canvass distinguished for Its bitter and malign personalities, he never, where principle (as he saw lt) was involved, sacri? ficed the right to the expedient, but always preferred, in maintaining his conv.ctions, rather to break than to bend. His fame will be national property, and will continue for many generations .to reflect lus? tre upon his country, while the colored race whom he aided so much to relieve from chattel and civic bondage, will, in gratefully cherishing the memory of his noble service, forget his one grievous fault. Ia conclusion, fellow-citizens, I would do injustice to the Impulses of my) heart should I fall, on each an occasion as the present, to recognize and gratefully acknowledge the services rendered to the cause of free gov? ernment In South Carolina by my distinguish? ed predecessor. First entering the State as a prisoner ot war, whose command was de? feated without dishonor, he was duly exchaog9d, after long confinement in a military prison, and at the close bf hostilities la* the field returned, with promotion to the rank of major-general of the United States Army, to administer the affairs of an Important burean of the government of our State. In that capacity he organized the labor system on a free baals, protecting alike the rights of the employer and the laborer. Hts administration as Governor of South Car? olina ls before the country, and *>y the coun? try lt will be Judged. Whatever that judg? ment may be, I but express the opinion of those who know him best, when I say that he has endeavored lo dlacharge the duties of his high office In the Interest of the party that elected him and for the welfare of the people of the Slate. With a solemn appreciation of the grave responsibility imposed upon me in the per? formance of my duties, and in the earnest hope that the Important matters involved in the situation before' us may bring about the utmost concert and unanimity of action, I commend your deliberations to the merciful superintendence of that Almighty Power which presides over States and nations. Governor Scott's valedictory mersage was read in the General Assembly to-day. Ita salient points were fully given in the sketch already published in THE

THE PBESID?NrS MESSAGE. CONGRESS IX SESSION-SIGNS OF A BETTER FEELING. A Sentible Move from' Sumner- \ Fit? ting Tribute to Horace Greeley Healthy Tone of the Message. WASHINGTON, Monday, December 2. Congress met at noon, Colfax and Blaine presiding in the Senate and House, respect ively. In the Senate, Sumner introduced a bill to strike from tbe United Slates flags and from tbe Army Register all mention of battles with oar fellow-citizens. Both houses unanimously adopted the fol? lowing concurrent resolution: Resolved by the Senate and House of Repre? sentatives, in view of the recent death of Horace Greeley, for whom at the late election more than three million ol votes were cast for President, That a record be made In the Jour? nals of Congress of: the appreciation fur the eminent services and personal purity and worth ot the deceased, and of the sad Impres? sion created by his death following a keen family bereavemenr. After a brief address, THE! 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE was announced, and read as follows: To the Senate and Rouse of Representatives: lu transmitting to you this, my fourth an? nual message, lt ls wi'.h thankfulness to the Giver of all Good thar, as a nation, we have been blessed for the past year with peace at home, peace abroad, and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples, wi LU the exception of the recent devastating fire, vrnich swept trom the earth with a breath, as lt were, millions of accumulated wealth In the City of Boston, there has been no overshadow? ing calamity within the year to record. It Is gratifying to note how, like their fellow-citi? zens of the City of Chicago under similar cir? cumstances a year earlier, the citizens of B ?sion are rallying under their misfortunes, and the prospect that their energy and perseverance will overcome ali obstacles, and show ihe same prosperity soon thur they would had no disaster befallen them. CK h rr wi-e. we have been free from pestilence, war and the cala? mities which often overtake nations, and, as tar as the human Judgment can penetrate the future, no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. 

FOREIGN' RELATIONS. When Congress adjourned ia June last, a question bad ueen raised by Great Britain, and was i hen pending, widen fora time seriously Imperilled (heseulement by friendly arbitra? tion of the grave differences between this government and that ol her Drlianulc Mn] s ty, which, by the Treaty of Washington, had beea referred to tne tribunal of arbitration which had met ut Geneva, In Swl zerland. Tne arbitrators, however, disposed ot the question which had Jeopardized the whole of toe treaty, and threat* ned to Involve me two nations In most unhappy relations towards each other.ln a manner entirely satisfactory to this government, and in accordance with the views and the policy which lt had maintained. The tribunal, which had convened at Geneva in December, concluded Its laborious session on the 5th of September last, on which day, having availed Itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to award a sum In groes, lt made Its de? cision, whereby lc awarded the sum of fifteen millions five hundred thousand do,lars in guld as the Indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to tho United States, lor the satisfaction ot all the claims referred to its consideration. This decision happily disposed ot a long standing difference between the two governments, and In connection with another award made by the German Emperor, under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these two governments without a shadow upou the friendly relations which, lt ls my sincere hope, may lorever remain equally unclouded. The report of the agent of the United'States ap? pointed to the amended Geneva irlouoal, ac? companied by the protocols of tne pro? ceedings of the arbitrators, the arguments of the counsel of both governments, the award of the tribunal and the opinion given by the several arbitrators, ls transmitted here? with. I have caused to be communicated to the heads of ihe three lrlendly powers who com? plied with the Joint request made them under the treaty the thanks or this government for the appointment ot arbitrators made by them, and also my than!:s to the eminent person? ages named by them, and my appreciation of the dignity, pittance, impartiality and great ability with which they discharged their ar? duous and high functions. Her Majesty's Government has communicated to me the ap? preciation by her Majesty of the "ability and indefatigable Industry displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named oa the part ol thia government, during ihe protracted in? quiries and discussions ot the tribunal. I cordially unite with her Majesty lo this appre? ciation. Ii Is due to the agent of the United Stales before the tribunal to record my high appreciation cf the marked ability, unwearied patience and the pru? dence and discretion with which he bas conducted ihe very responsible and delicate duties committed to him. as lt is also dtie to the learned and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this gov? ernment, to express my praise of tbe talents and wisdom which lliey brought to bear in the attainment of the result so happily reached. It will be the province ol Congress to provide for the distribution, among those who may be entitled ir, of their respective shares of the money io be paid, although ihe sum awarded ls not payable uniil a year irom the dale of the award. It ls deemed advisa? ble ihat no lime be lost in making a proper examination of the several cases In which in demulfl.atlou maybe due, and I consequently recommend ihe creation ol a board of com? missioners lor the purpofie. THE S.O JOAN BOUNDARY. By the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty of Washington, the respective claims ut the United Stales ami of Great Britain, in their construction of the treaty of thu 15LII of June, 1846, defining the boundary line between their respective territories, were submitted to the arbitration and award ot his Majesty, the fm peror of Germany, to decide wnicti of those claims ls most In accordance with the due in? terrelation with ihe ireaties of 1846. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, having beea pleased to undertake the arbitration, be has the earnest thanks of this government and of the people of the Uoited States for tho labor, pains and eire which he has devoted tu the consideration of this long pending differ? ence. I have caused an expression of my thanks to be communicated to his Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the representative of this government at Berlin, conducted the Oise and prepared ile statement on the part of the United States with the ability that his past services Justified the public lu expecting at his hands. As a member of the Cabinet at the dale >oi the treaty which has given rise to the discussion between the two govern? ments, as the minister to Great Britain when the construction now'pronounced unfounded was first advanced, and as ihe agent and re? presentative of the government to present the case and to receive the award, he haB been associated with the question lu all of IIB phase?, and in every ?tage luis manilesied a patriotic zeal and earnestness In the mainte? nance of the claim of Lhe Uuited States. He is entitled io much credit for thesucceBs which has attended the submission, aller a patient Investigation, ot the case and of the statement of eacn party. His M?Jeaty, the Emperor, oa the 2lst day of October last, signed his award ia writing, decreeing that the claim of the Government of the Uuited States that the bouodaiy line between the territo? ries of her Brlttajlc Majesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro Channel ls most In accordance with the true interpretation ol the treaty concluded on the 15th ot June, 1841. between the Governments of her Bril an nie Majesty and of the United States. Copies of the case presented on be? half of each government, and of the state? ment In reply of fach, and a translation of the award, are tr?nen ?tied herewith. This award confirma the Uni .ed States in their claim to tue arcbipeligo of islands iylng between the Continent and Vancouver's Island, which for more than twenty-six years, ever since the ratification ot the treaty, Great Britain has contested, and leaves us, tor the first time in the history of the Uoited States as a nation, without a question of disputed boundary be? tween our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on i his Continent, It is mygrate lol duty to acknowledge the prompt and apon (anemia action of her Majesty V Governs in giving effect to the award. In anticipai ot any request from this government, and fore the reception in the United States of award signed by the Emperor, her Maj< had given Instructions for the removal of troops which had been stationed there, i Tor the cessation of all exercise or claim ol rlsdlctioo, BO as to leave the United State the exclusive possession of the lateiy dlspu territory. I am gratified to be able to nounce that the orders lor the removal of troops have been executed, and that milit Joint occupation of San Juan has ceased. ' islands are now in tbe exclusive possessio! the United States. It now becomes neceas to complete the survey and determination that portion of the boundary line through Haro Channel, upon which the commissi ers which determined the remiii.log part the line were uoable to agree I recommt the appointment of a commissioner to Jointly with one which may be named by 1 Majesty for thar, purpose. Experience ot i difficulties attending the determination our admitted line of boundary after rhe cupatlon of the territory and its settlement thowe owing allegiance to the respective g< ernments, points to the Importance of iHollshine. by natural objects or other moi ments, the actual line between the terrlfc acquired by purchase from Russia and tbe t Joining possessions of her Britannic Hajes It Is now so sparsely occupied that no ci il leting interesis ot Individual Jurisdiction E likely to Interfere. But delay will embarn the actual locailon of the line If < ferred until population shall enter and occu the territory, when trivial contest of neig hors may again array the two governtnei in antagonism. I therefore recommend t appointment of a commission to act J ol ai with one that may be appointed on the part Great Britain to determine the line betwe our Territory of Alaska and the possessions Great Britain. In my last annual message I recommend the l?gislation necessary on the part ot tl United States to bring Into operation tl articles of the Treaty of Washington ot Mi 8,1871, relaliog to the fisheries and to otb matters touching the relations of the Unit* States toward British North America. Posse ?lons become operative so soon aa the prop legislation should be had on the part of Gre Britain and Ita possessions; that legislation < the part of Great Britain and tts possess loi had not been had, and during the session Congres? a question wan raised, which for tl lime raised a doubt whether anv action I Congre SH In the direction lndloited would b come important. This question has Bin been disposed of. and I have received noli that the Imperial Parliament and the L>gl?l ture of the Provincial Government na' passed laws to curry the provisions ot the tree on the matters ivffrtvd Into operation, therefore commen ; jour early adoption of tl legislation ia the same direction necessary c the part of this government. Tne Joint comm! sion for detcruiiulng tue boundary betwee the Quited States aud the British possession between the Lake of the Woods and it Rocky Mountain;*, hus organized and cuter? upon ita work. IL IS desirable that the fort be increased In order that the completion the survey and determination of the Iii may be tue sooner attained. To this eud recommend that a sufficient appropriation I made. ? With France, our earliest ally, Russia, tl constant and steady friend or the Unite States, Germany, with whose government at people we have so maoy causes of frlendshl and so many common sympathies, and tl other powers of Europe, our relations ai maintained of the most friendly terms. Since my last annual message the exebaof has been made ol the ratification of a treal with the German Empire respecting conan and trade marka; alao of a treaty with S we den and Norway, relating to naturalization, s of which treaties have been duly proclalme Congress at Its last session having made s appropriation to defray the expenses of coo rniBciona on the part of thu Untied States l the International Statistical Congress at 8 Petersburg, the persons appointed lu tb character prooeeded lo their de?iknalloa? an attended tbe sessions of the Coogress. Toe report shall, In due season; be laid before yo This Congress meets at Intervals of abo three years, and has held Its session in sev ral of the countries of Europe. I submit your consideration the propriety of extend?? an Invitation to the Congress to bold Its ne. meeting in the United Suites. The centenn) celebration to be held in 1873 would afford u appropriate occasion for such meeting. Preparations are making for the iaterni tionul Exposition, to be held during the ne. year in Vienna, on a scald of very great maj nitude. The tendency of these expositions in the direction of advanced civilization, an ol the elevation of industry and of labor, nn of the Increase or human Happiness as well s ot greater Intercourse and good-will betwee Obtlons. As that Exposition ls to be the fin which will have been held In Eastern Europt it ls believed that American inventors an manufacturers will oe ready to avail then Belves of the opportunity for the presentatlo of their productions, lt encouraged by prope aid aud protection. At the last session c Congress authority was given for the appoint ment of one or more agents to represent thi government at the Exposition. The autborlt thus given has been exercised, but in the at sence ot any appropriation there is daoger thu the Important benefit which the occasion offer will, in a,large degree, be lost to citizens o the (Jolted Slates. I commend the subjec strongly to your consideration, and recom mend that au adequate appropriation be madi for the purpose to further aid American ex ti i bi tors at the Vienna Exposition. I woul< recommend, lu addition tu an appropriate of money, that the secretary of the navy bi authorized to fit up two naval vessels to trans port between our Atlantic coast and Trieste or the most convenient port to Vienna ant baok, their articles for exhibition. Since your last session the President of tin Mexican Republic, distinguished by hts hlizl character and by his services to his country has fulfilled his temporary succession, ant has now been elected with great unanimity bi the people, a proof of confidence on tbeli part lu his patriot ism aod wisdom, which lt li believed will be confirmed by the results o his administration. It ls particularly deslra ble that nothing should be left undone by the Government of their Republic lo strengthen their relations as neighbors and friends. It Is much to be regretted that man j lawless acts continue to disturb the quiet oi the settlements on the border between out territory and that ol Mexico, and complainte of wrougs to Americas citizens In various parts of the country are made. The revolu? tionary condition in which the neighboring Republic baa BO long been involved has In some degree contributed to this disturbance. It la io be hoped that with a more settled rule of order throughout the Republic, which may be expected from the present government, the acts of which Just complaints are made will cease. The proceedings of the commis? sion under the convention with Mexico of the .f m of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have unfortunately been checked by an obstacle for the removal of which measures Lave been taken by the two governments, which lt is believed will prove successful. The commissions appointed pursuant to the Joint resolution of Congress of the 7th of May lust to inquire Into the depre? dations on tbe Texan frontier have diligently made InveBllcatlons In that quarter. Their researches were necessarily Incomplete, partly ou account o? the limited appropriation made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that government, has appointed a search commis? sion er to investigate these outrages. It ls not announced onlclally, but the press of that couniry stale that the lullest investigation le desired, and that the co-operation ol all par? ties concerned ls Invited io secure that end. I therefore recommend that a special appro? priation be made at the earliest practicable moment to enable the commisioners on the part of the United States to return to their la? bore without delay. 

CUBA. lt Is with regret that I have again to an? nounce a continuance of the disturbance of the Island of Cuba. No advance toward the pacification of the discontented part of the population has been made, while the insur? rection has gained no advantage and exhibits no more or the elements or power or of the prospects of ultimate success than were ex? hibited a year ago. bpaln, on the other hand, has not succeeded In its repression, and the parties stand apparently In the same rela? tive attitude which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest has laatod now for more than four years. Were it Been at a distance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent as to Its results, although humani? ty could not but be moved by many of Its Inci? dents wherever they mi? nt occur. It la, how ever, at our door. I cannot doubt that tl continued maintenance o? slavery in .Cuba among the strongest Inducements' for tt continuance of the ?trifft. A terrible wror ls tbe natural cause of a terrible evi The abolition of slavery and the ln<rodn lion of other reforms In the admlnletratlo of government In Cuba could not fall I advance the restoration of peace and ordei It Is greatly to be boped that the present Ubi ral government of Spain will voluntar!] adopt this view. The law of emanclpatlo which was passed more than two yearn alec bas remained unexecuted in the absence c regulations for Its enforcement. It was but i feeble step toward emancipation; bat' lt wa the r?cognition of right, and was bailed a such, and exhibited Spain In harmony will sentiments o? humanity and of Justice, and ii sympathy with the other powers of tb Christian aod civilized world. Within th past few weeds the regulation* for carry mi out the law of emancipation bave been an nouueed, giving evidence of the sincerity o Intentions of the present government to carr; into effect the law of 1870. I have not fallei to urge the consideration of the wisdom o the polioy, and the Justice of a more effective ayUem for the abolition ol tbe great evil which oppresses a racp, ant continues a bloody and desiraetta contest, close to oar borders, as well as tb< expediency and the justice of conceding re torms, of which the propriety is not question? ed. Deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is. one of. the most active causes of the continuance cf the unhappy condition In Cuba, l regret to believe that citizens of the United Slates, or those claiming to be such, are large holders In Cuba of what ls there claimed aa property, bot what ls forbidden and denounced by the lawi of the United States. They are thur, la defi? ance ot the spirit of our own laws, contribu? ting to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest. lu my last annual mes? sage I referred to this subject, and I again re? commend suco- leglrlatlou aa may bu proper to denounce, and, if not prevent, at least to discourage american citizens from holding or dealing lu slaves. It ls grail ly lng to announce that the ratifi? cations ot the convention conducted under the auspices of this government between Spain on the one part, and the Allied Repub Iles of the Pacific on the other, providing tor an armistice, have been exchanged. A copy 01 the instrument ls herewith Buomitted. It la hoped that thia may be followed ty a perma? nent peace between the same parties. The differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace between Brazil and the Argentine Republics, lt is boped, are. io the way of sat! si ac tory adjustment. With these Slates, ss with the Republics of Central and of South America, we continue to maintain ihe most friendly relation* It le with regret, however, that I announce that th* 'Govern? ment of Venezuela bas made no further pay? ments on account nf- the awards wier 'HA convention of the 25th of April, 1866. That Republic is understood to be uuw aiinoei, if uot quite, tranquilized. It is hoped mat lc will loee no Hine lu providing for the unpaid balance ot lis debt lo the Untied cit?tes, which, having originated in lujuries to. our Cilizeus by the Veuezuelan auiuorllteg, and having been acknowledged pursuant tn a treaty in the most solemn form known among nation-, would seem to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin contracted In a different manner. This eubject ls agam're? commended to the atteo'lon of Oonoiess for such action as may be deemed proper.. THE 

EAST. Our treaty relations with Japan remain un? changed. An Imposing embassy frem that lu? te resting and progressive nation visited this country during the year that Is passing, but being unprovided with powers for the signing ot a convention in ibis country, no conclusion Inihat direction was reached. It.ls hoped, however, that the Interchange of opinions which toole place during their stay lu ibis country has led to a- mutual appreciation? of the Interests which may be promoted when the revision of the existing treaty shall be under? taken. In this connection I renew ray recom? mendation of one year ago, that to gi ve impor? tance and to add to the efficiency ot our diplo? matic relations with Japan and Cn I na. and to turther aid lu retaining the good opinion of those people and to secure to the United States Its share of the commeroe destined to flow be tween those nations and the balance of tba commercial world, an appropriation be made io support at least four American youths lo each of those countries, to tents aa a part of the officiai family ot our ministers there...Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain and.of some other powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for Interpreters aod translators upon natives of those countries who know our language perfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employees ia foreign business houses or the interpreters to other loreign ministers. I renew the recommendation made on a previous oocaalon of tbe transfer to the de? partment of the interior, to which they seem more appropriately lo belong, of ail' the powers aod duties In relation lo the Territo? ries wiih which the department of.State ls now charged by law or by custom. Congress, from the beginning of the gov? ernment, has wisely made provision for the relief of distressed seamen in foreign 0000 trles. No sanitary providion, however, has hitherto been made for the relief of cit liens in distress abroad other than seamen. It -la un? derstood to be customary with other govern? ments to authorize consuls to extend such re? lief to tbelr citizens or subjects in certain cases. A similar authority, and an appropria? tion to carry lt into effect, are recommended in the case of citizens of the United States, desiituie or sick. Under such circumstances lt is well koowa that each citizens .resort to foreign countries in great numbera." Though most of them are able to bear.the expenses in? cident to locomotion lhere are some, who, through accident or otherwise, become penni? less and have no lriends at home able to suc? cor them. Persons in this situation'-?Met either perish, cast themselves upon- the .charity ot foreigners, or be . relieved at the private charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the most benevolent dispo .tlon, have nothing to spare' for such persons. Should the authority and appropriation asked for be granted, care will be taken so to carry the beneficence of Congress Into effect, that lt shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily be? stowed.
