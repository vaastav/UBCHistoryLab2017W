I?angerman, who was convicted last week of criminal assault upon Miss Uarbara Aub, a young book canvasser, In a free man to-night. Miss Aub ban confessed that she perjured herself at tho trial, that her relations with Langermnn were voluntary, and that hl? story of the alleged assault was true throughout. Langerman woi to have .been sentented Friday, but wa? remanded until to-day. The surmise was that 'Kecorder lioff won anxious to learn more of Langerman's past In order to gunge the sentence to be imposed upon blm. At 11 o'clock this morning Langerman was taken before Ilecorder Goff for-sentence in tho criminal court building. The prisoner's counsel, Colonel Ilalro, mo\'i;d for a new trial. District Attorney Follows asked that the motion be denied, and his request was granted. Then tho recorder rose, as everybody thought, to pronounce the sentence upon Langerman. Recorder Onff began, by describing the prisoner ns a man of evil reputation, but suddenly broke off and said that aff?r thi> vi-riilnt wiiH found bv the jury. In* hod made a p^raonnl lnv?*stlKtitIon of the case, and then ho made known the /not thai lJarhura Aub had mado u confpssioV to him, exonerating l.anKorman, mid Maying she hud done him a great wrong. t'he admitted that her relation* with tht* prisoner had bwn voluntary. The recorder wound up by dismissing the In-Motnient against I.nngerman, but committed htrn to the house of doti-ntlon as a witness against Miss Aub. Immediately after Lnngermnn had been-oomniitted Minn Aub was arraigned before the court on a Charge of perjury. The recorder tol l Mlf=s Aub tlit: he was sorry for her, but that she had done more harm t?? Justice In general than to Langerrnan "Versonally. "In days coming," he said, "when men are convicted on apparently good evidence, luwyors will point to the Aub case aa a precedent." The rer .rder then committed Mls? Aub to the city prison. He then stated that I^nnifcrman's ball had I ecu tlxed nt SI,000.' Friends of the prisoner qualified In bonds for that sum, and Langermun was liberated.

FASTEST TRAIN;. lilt lie World Uiui Over the Nov York Central Road, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT ON TIME Oivlux to an An Mi nt Near (he End of the Itun?TJie Weather anil OtherCou* dltlous Were t.'reut Hindrances to .fluking the ltrcard lh-alred, lint 111 Spite of TIiimi llitniUt up* the Train Made the DUfuut o From New York to llufftilo, Four Ilnudreduud Forty Mlleitlu Four Hundred anil .Mnetyfmir Mlnutca, Including Three Ships und Exclusive of | T\veuly-alx Minute*1 Delay. New YonK, Doc. 2.?The New York Contral railroad to-day demonstrated its ability to rua upon its road the fattest regular train in tho world, although it failod in this, particular rua to finish upon the schedule time laid out for it. This tailuro was duo entirely to an accidont, tho other portions of tho run showing conclusively that tho fast scheduled time can bo accomplished, and ovonexcolled. Up to six months ago, tho train known as tho Empiro-State express had the world's record as a regular train for fast running. Tbo London railway of England, running from I,ondon to Aberdeon, began to ran * trifle faster than the Empiro State's record of fifty-one miles am hoar. Today tiie Central road began a now sctiodulo for this train which nocossitales an hourly ruu of fifty-throe sad.a third milos, about two miles an hoar fastor tliflu the English rival. Loaving New York this morning at 8:30, and with ovory condition against her, this traiu mado moro than throequarters of tho distance in even faster time than tho now schedule calia. for. Tho rogalnr Empiro Ktate express had added to it the special car of vico President Webb, weighing 100.400 pounds. In addition to this extra weight a drizzling rain was falling, making the tracks extromoly slippory, and the oxtra woigiit wai carried on tho end of tho train instead of next to tho engine, making the rosiatanco greater. Tho run from Now York to, Albany, a distance of 142.88 miles, was inailo in two hours and thirty-six minetos. And tho intn tlx. ilnnrrf tnnr minntm ahead of tho now ichodulo, and nine minutes ahead of tho old ichedulo. Half way between tiyracnse and Rochoator tho drizzling ram taraed to enow, and tho wind, wlxioh had been with tho train ao much of tho distanco, changed to a head wind of groat resistunco. Dospito thoso conditions thj> train rolled into Rochester exactly on time. From ttochostor as far an Churchvillo, ' fifty-sir miles oast of tho Empire State's destination, Duilalo, tho atatious wore passod exactly upon acbedulo time. Just after parsing Churchvillo. whero tho odgine takes water from tho track wator trough by scoop without stopping, tho scoop caught in uu obstruc* tion in tho trough, and dropping down bangod against tho ties for at least.a mile untii tho train conld bo brought to a standstill. It was fourtoon minutes before tho dainago could be ropairod j and at lenat three minutos had boon lost in slowing up and stopping. When tho train was again started after a loai of ! seventeen minute*, it was closo upon tlio long heavy grado running up to j llatavia and lacking tho tremendous momentum which it usually has, it lost threo minutes luoro on this upizrado. ! The slippery tracks also added to the delay, and when tho Batavis station was passed tho train was 25$ minutea | behind tho now schedule. Tho run into IJutfnlo from Batavia, a distanco of 40 miles, was mado in about 31 minutos, vorv fait timo. Tho train rolled into Buffalo 23 minutos bohind tho uow ichodulo tiino and two minutes ahead of tho old ichodulo. Tho ontire run of 440 miles, including three itnni and nxrlnaivn of adftlflV of 20 min ulo's, was modo in 494 minutes. A
