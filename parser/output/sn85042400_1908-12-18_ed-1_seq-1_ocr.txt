R. h N. train No. 1, Conductor Dunn, was held up and the express dynamited by four unmasked robbers ; shortly after 9 o'clock tonight nine miles east of Portland. Express Messenger O. H. Huff is authority for the statement that the robbers secured little of value. The robbers did not molest the passengers, but uncoupled the ex press car and ordered the engineer to take it down the track toward" Port land. About a mile beyond the point where the train was held up the doors of the express car were shattered by the use of nitro-glycerine. Once in side the car the robbers- discovered to their dismay that the train did not carrv a tbrouch safe, a small local safe being the only receptacle forj valuables. The robbers compelled Huff to open the small safe. It con tained but three or four small pack ages, of little value. The strong box was not touched. Express Mes senger Huff was obliged to give up about $3.00 of his personal money and the robbers quit the car, escap ing in the darkness. The robbers boarded the train at Hood River and had reached a point one mile west of Clarnie when suddenly the engi neer heard a command to obey the robbers instructions.' Aa the com mand was accompanied by a display of firearms the order was, obeyed. The robbers than ordered the engi neer to stop the train and in a twink ling the express car was cut off from the rest of'the train. The, engineer was commanded to proceed and af ter going about a mile he was told to stop. The robbery followed. The engine waa then cut off and the quartet boarded it, forcing the engineer to bring the engine o Mon tavilla, about four miles east of here. There they jumped off and disap peared in the darkness. One of the robbers had his face blackened. He is believed to be a Swede The express messenger was aole to give a more or less accurate description of two of the quartet. . A special train has left this city for the scenei It carries a posse of deputy sheriffs, railroad detectives and officials of the O. R. & N. , The looted train train reached thi Union Depot in this city late to night. - The express car was . not badly damaged and save for a broken door showed little effect of the robbery. Interviews with trainmen are to the effect that while the robbers were forcing an entrance into the car, Huff opened the way to .the safe which is stated to have contained bags of .money aggregating some where between $2000 and $4000 and thrown them into the corner of the car behind some merchandise. Huff, according to their version, as a Mind, seized three or four packages of cheap jewelry from a shelf and put them into into the safe throwing the door to, but not locking it. ' Messenger Huff says that the rob ber! used two charges of nitro glycerine to effect the entrance. They selected the second of the two express cars to operate on. It was in the front one they immediately came on. , "I was in the front one" Hud said, 'when they immediately came through to my car, and flashing . a spot light on me, made me hold up my hands. Then they made me open the safe. There was nothing in it except some packages of cheap jewel ry which they took. I believe the robbers were amateurs at the business; they kept up shouting and swearing like troopers all the time they were in the car and were greatly enraged when they got no money.".
