Ir is said President Arthur will appoint no women to take charge of post-office's or pen don agencies. His reasons being given, by his friends, that the Post-Office Department has caused much dissatisfac tion in the party. Warden Crocker lias received a number of annonymous letters advising him to re move the prisoners from t he wing of the jail ■where Guiteau is confined, so that in the event of a dynamite explosion no life ex cept that of Guiteau'» will be endangered. The bill introduced in the Senate by Vest for the improvement of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, provides for the ex penditure of $10,000,000 under the direc tion of tlie engineer corps of the army— one half of the amount upon the Mississip , pi, and the remainder upon the Missouri— in accordance with the plans already re commended by the Mississippi River Com' mission. _ The mimlier of bills introduced in the Senate during the session of the 9th was 350, which is nearly as many as were introduced in that body during the entire third session last Congress. One Senator alone has introduced thirtv-three bills since last Monday. A large proportion of the measures introduced thus far are copies of private relief bills that heretofore failed to receive final action. A Washington special says: Sixteen of tlie experts summoned on either side of the Guiteau trial have held consultation, at which it was found that all were agreed in the opinion that tlie assassin is sane, and legally responsible for the murder of Gar field. This number includes practically tlie whole body of experts now here attend ing the trial. One of them said to-night that he did not know a single expert who would testify that Guiteau was insane. It is uusafe to make even a heavenward trip on Sunday, os a London cablegram of the 12th, goes to prove, it savs: The Government balloon in charge of Captain Templar, accompanied by Powell, Member of Parliament for Malmesbury, and Gard ner, ascended from Bath Sunday, and de c-ended at Bridgeport. The balloon struck the ground heavily, and Garder and Cap tain Templar were thrown out and injured, 'flie balloon then rose with Powell and was seen again to descend at sea. Notliing has «ince been or hoard of »Hk balloon or Powell. The Governor of Idaho on the Mor mon Situation. Governor Neil of Idaho, now in New Yoik, was interviewed Sunday bv a 1 nb une reporter on the subject of Mormon ism The former said : Mormonism is a se rious question on tiie Pacific Coast, and the Mormons are making special eftorts to control Territories outside of Utah, where they have complete mastery. It the pr^ss of the country would discuss the question thorou-'hlv a'sentiment would soon be cre ated that would compel Congress to act in the matter. I would also like to say that division of parties in Utah is Mormon and anti-Mormon, There are no Republicans or Democrats known as such there, and 1 find among the staunchest anti-Mormons, su -I. as Judge Rosborough, JM?e Souther land Col. Samuel Merritt and many other prominent Democrats, all as hostile as any Republican to the prevailing system. It is part of the plan of the Mormon Church to populate surrounding Territories and States with its adherents with a view of Paul, the built self ing dint ion and tlie ultimatelv gaining control of them, and then, by bargaining with either of the po litical partie»! to have the Territories ad mitted as Stales, thus obtaining the balance of power in Congress. In my opinion the Mormon Church is more ot a political titan a religious organization, and I am convinced that it is a treasonable orgamza tion. I believe that all members ot it who iro through the Endow ment House, take an oath of hostility to this Government. I have mvself heard treasonable doctrins preached in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. In mv Judgment it will be necessary, ulti mately, to deal with the question horn tills standpoint, unless Congress adouts immediately very effectual measures to prevent the practice and spread of Polyga my, for that is the corner stone ot he Church. Polygamy gives all who join tlie society a community of interest in crime and that, two, is why priests insist so stren ouslv on the practice of polygamy. they l,iow that interest in cihue will strengthen the Church, and make it better able to ac complish its designs. Bear Lake county in Idaho is populated exclusively by Mor mons. The last census gave it a popula tion of 4:0.1. Oneida County, having the largest representation in Hie 1 erritory Legislature, is controlled by Mormons, w-lio have a population ot about 4,000 out ot a*total 6 of 7 500. in Cassia County tliev have a number ol settlements, and are" enable by throwing their voles tor those w ho are friendly to -hem to decide the elections. The Territory has a popula tion uf about 40,000, and the Mormons number nearly KVX*»- Mormoi m-in !» op posed to all our industries, particulaily to killing, w hich is the greatest interest on the Pacific Slope. If tlie Mormons had power thev would not permit an ounce of ore to be mined; nor, indeed, would thev allow anv person hostile to their _ pe culiar institution to settle in their midst. I am frequently asked how is it that in a free country like this the Mormon priest hood exercise »0 complete a control over tlie followers of tlie church. It is oa>v »1 explanation. The Mormon community i* largely made up of the nw-t superstition class "of foreigner*. When brought to . Ameiica they lire put mi the ears at New York and taken as rapidly as possible to Utah where they are placed »atel.v m Mor mon hamlet».

Hereafter deeluring'their intentions to be come citizens, they take up a home on Government land,* In this respect their condition is infinitely better than before, and the Mormon church receives, in the minds of these ignorant persons, all the glory and credit for this improvement in their afiairs. [Correspondence . WASHINGTON LETTER [From our regular Correspondent.J Washington, Dec. 7th, 1881. At no time since tlie war has Congress assembled under such favorable auspices as the present. We have no foreign troub les to annoy us and are confronted by noth ing but peace and prosperity at home. The financial condition of our country is better than ever before and t.licre are no great disturbing questions of any sort lobe considered. All branches of the Govern ment are under control of the same party, yet the lines of demarcation between the nvo great parties are so faint, and the ma jorties in each branch so weak, that politi cal legislation in its narrow sense will not form a potent factor |iu tlie proceedings of Congress. Barring tlie new appointment lor members of the House, in accordance with the late census, there does not seem to be any political issue worthy of note and tlie one great object of congressional action must be the canvass and determination of the best methods of maintaining the coun try's prosperity and strengthening the foun dation of our business vigor. The opening day was a comparatively quiet one, though on the House side all the galleries were crowded. For one day that body proved an attraction able to compete with the Guiteau trial, but it could not keep it up. There were no especially sensation al scenes to reward the curiosity seekers. A look over the House from the reporter's gallery disclosed the fact that it is com posed of rather an unusually fine hodv of men graced by n number of old familiar faces whom the fortunes of politics had again returned to the places from which they had once retired- Abram S. Hewitt is one of the most prominent of|these and he doos not appear to have changed much since I last saw him on the floor, except, perhaps, the wrinkles on his brow have deepened somewhat. Holmer, of Indiana, the great objector and economist, whom so many hoped had permanently left the ser vice" of his country, has come back to plague all joohers. Kasson, ol Iowa, does not appear to have changed or aged or lost any of his easy alert manner since he left Congress tour years ago. There are many regrets that lie failed to capture the Speakership, for his superior qualifications for the place are universally acknowledged. lie satina section that front is tlie seat so long occupied hv tlie late President. Mr. Tavlor, the successor S' centered around the Virginia readjusters, Paul, and Faulkerson. The former is on the brunette style of architecture, well built and ornamented with a black mous tache. Both voted with the Republicans. The Speaker-elect, Gen. Kriier, is like Garfield, a self-maile man. He fitted him* self for the higher duties of life while work ing on a farm and acquired an education bv dint of hard labor and hard study, but had scarcely begun his career when the rebell ion broke out. He enlisted early in tlie war and fought to the end, winning the rank ot brigadier general, and commander ol a di vision. lie has served two terms in Con gress, and though not taking rank amongst tlie brilliant debaters, he has shown solid practical qualities that have given him a good standing in the House. 1 lie feeling that, because of the elevation of a citizen ot men he and liv of of Gtni.

He started with much more strength than any other cuudi d ite, und, therefore, it w as natural for the western member* to rally around him when it came to a choice between tin east ern and western man. Gen. Keiler un doubtedly had the support of what is termed the "stalwarts," but as his nomination was finally accomplished by votes outside ot the stalwart combination, he will occupy an independent position, and probably liis efforts will be to heal the breach in the Re publican ranks rather than to head a tac tion. Tlie committees will not lx? an nounced for two weeks but it is generally believed that the two most important chair man ships. Wavs and Means and Appropri ations, will be given to J udge Kelly, ot Pennsylvania, and lllscock, of New Y oik, respectfully. . , * lie done In , j to One Congress will be tlie taking of some action w ith reference to the payment of the verv heavy expenses incurred by tlie illness of tlie late President. It seems to be accept ed that if Congress assumes tlie pay ment the three civilian physicians, Drs. Bliss, Agnew and Hamilton, will not expect ess than $25,000 each for their services. Ihcv consider, it is said, that the direct loss to them from Inattention to their regular prac tice, expenses, &c., will amount to one-hall of this sum. No bills, it is said, growing out of the care of the President during 111 illness have been rendered, though Mrs. Garfield has in several Instances requested that thev lie sent to her. Of course if Con gress is to pav the bills, every one con cerned will render much larger accounts than il Mrs. Garfield was to settle, and Dr. Bli-s has intimated that lie and Ins asso elates would not take anything troiii Mrs. Garfield if the Government should not pav. The proposition which appears to meet the most favor is that Congress shall designate or authorize the President to designate, one or more persons to act a- a commission to audit all hills, w hich, on their report, shall be paid bv the Secretary 01 the iicasury. 1 • Dom Pc into.

GREAT THEATRE FIRE. Terrible Loss of Life in the Ring The atre, Vienna. # Four Hundred Dead Bodies Reported Found In the Rnins. Vienna, Dec.8.—The RingTheatie,for merly tlie comic opera house, where Sarah Bernhardt recently performed, took tire at seven o'clock to-night just betöre tlie be ginning of the opera Les Contes de Hoff man. The fire was caused by tlie fall of a lamp on the stage. The house was tolera bly full and the loss of life is great. Up to the present time seventy bodies are recov ered. Many other persons are injured. Sixty were saved by means of ladders and by jumping into cloths held below. The greatest efforts were made to save tile. Tlie scene was terrible, the liâmes shooting up through the root'and evidently getting tlie entire building. Vienna, it p. m.—One hundred and forty-five lx slice have iieen brought out of tlie theatre dead. There are still numer ous bodies which were consumed in the galleries and'other elevated parts of the building. The chief cause of the catastro phe was that in tlie confusion the iron por tion, sept-rating the stage from tlie audito rium, was not lowered. Thousands of peo ple assembled in the neighboiing streets, where they could hear the cries of agony of tlie people" at the w inflows of the theatre, praying to lie saved. The rapidity of the dames prevented the people from taking advantage ol the ordinary exits. Only « small portion of tlie audience saved them selves leaping from the windows three stories higli into cloths below. It is esti mated that the audience in tlie theatre numbered 2,000. Many persons were trampled to death in the panic which en sued. As soon as the fire was seen there was an explosion of gas and the audience was left in darkness. The taking of bodies from the theatre still continues. It is esti mated 300 persons perished. Some bodies are fearfully disfigured. Several persons were injured bv springing fiom tlie win dows of tlie theatre. Among tlie missing are 1 lerr Fife, the court musical director, and Herr Hellim-sperger.
