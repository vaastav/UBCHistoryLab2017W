What he says uboitt the famous Ceueva Arbitra tion is doubt less well enough, but it rniiuot be denied that the conduct of our government in the manage ment of that transaction was not eal "iilated to give foreign nations a very exalted opinion of the fairness and traight-forwordncss of American liiplomztie dealing. Hut the President is right i:i a-suming that this tinted reocguitioii of l he principle of arbi tril lion ai a mean of settling interna tional disputes, is an important step taken by the christian world towards a higher, a more human civilization, j A fair (-bowing is made f our re lations w ith foreign powers, which is not very surpi Ning, since thisgov ernmcnt now for ninuy years has not i,ein v,,,.y p,oinpt to dcft'itd its dig-: u-lty a,i honor, as represented in the persons of its eiti.ens abroad. Tho cloven-foot part of the mes sage begins to appear in the notice of the Cuban insurrection, when it goeout of tho way to denounce the institution of slavery as It. exists there, and calls foi congressional If g Ulatiou to prevent citizens of the United States from holding such properly iut.'ubn. Such transparent ilemngoguery coming from a man of Grant's known antecedents Is disgust ing. The portion of the niessne relat ing to the South is as unfair n could be. Prominent mention is made of the po called K11 Klux outrnges, but not a word is said about tho infa mous carpet-bag governments, which will go down to history a permanent disgrace to the American linine. The people of that unfortunate section ar, ,,f,iied that the enforcement act win be rigiitty carried out, nut no guaranty of an hoansl administra tion of their affairs is vouchsafed. The fact is that the message, so tar as it relates to our internal affairs, is cl!ishy partisan. In Radical eyes it no doubt appears to be faultless, but the warm commendation it lias re ceived ot the hands of certain Dem ocratic papers in a matter of some nstouishmout to us. Just So.

Preliminary, however, thereto, and to account for my silence in the j premises, I would add that the Cau-!!,11, cnsitui of the 7th iHst., failed to pub lish a letter of explanation which I addressed them oil the 61I1 inst., and delivered in person, tendering pay ment if necessary for it publica tion, which was politely refus ed with the assurance that the letter should appear in their last issue, with their anticipated article on the subject, when much to iny surprise, a miserable, garblcil edito rial statement was substituted there for, and npended to a malicious ar ticle which its author thought too contemptible to father ; but the edi tors of that paper possessed the petty, vindictive spirit necessary to stand goj-l'nther to it, thus compelling me to repent the substance thereof, namely: That immediately 011 peru sal of such article iu the St. Louis Republican of the 8th inst., I en closed a hastily written response thereto to the editor of the St. Jo seph Gazette, denying 011 behalf of the Board, and myself in particular, miy knowledge or information re garding said alleged appropriation of $1.1,000, or any oilier sum to the Board, or any complicity by the Board or any member thereof direct ly or indirectly in the transaction ; at the same time calling for a meeting of the Board at the earliest practica ble moment in St. Joseph, and tend- ..ti, on.l ii,n 1, ,.1.1:..

Hav ing had suflieient experience in news paper controversies to desire to avoid a complication of so serious a mat ter, I wished to confine itsilUcus- sion to one journal, tho (ia.ctte, in which it originated, ami through which I feel confident that an expo sition of tho matter will be made to the full satisfaction of the public and vindication of the honor of the com missioners as a Board and individu als.

At my suggestion the Board convencson the 1.1th inst., at St. Joseph, and 1 am satisfied will thereupon give publici ty to such notions and facts as will nut fail to satisfy even that most recent and enthusiastic convert to and conservator of public reform, the Lexington Caucasian; and as evi dence of my sincerity in these antici pations, I would give as abatis tho facts: 1st, that each and every mem ber of the Board have immediately on perusal of the article forwarded to the Cazetto their denial of (,e same and of any complicity there with, directly or indirectly; 2l,;that Hon.

I have no doubt but that the names of several distintruishcd KOiitlemeu will be. before our next legislature for that position in fact, mcutiou has been made of several already, and iu select ing from Ihe long catalogue of names, we should endeavor to aplcct an able, active, and efficient working man, one who is alive to, and vigilant of of the interests of the . great Stale which ha is the representative, and i:i doing so, I am clearly of the opin ion that we ran find no better man than Col. Win. II. Hatch, of Hanni bal. Col. llttch is a Keiituckiiiu hy birth end education, and is 110 w iu the very vigor of manhood, both physically and mentally (being about forty years of age), and possesses ex perience, business information, and personal acquaintance with tho in tricate workings of the machinery of governments which it require to make a successful representative of a vrcat commonwealth like ours, lie is au jurist mid an experienced politician, and when quite young, wts- tho-Uw partner of Joshua t . j., Ouoof the ablest lawyers and .i;tT...,i.i..i ,.r K..,.t.i,.i.-v's c;n.uit attorney in his district, his comuetitors b.dng Mai. I'iudell, of over both of them by a large major! ty, and was elected for the second term without opposition, and dis charged the duties of the office ably of the whole district. At the com- mciiccnieiil of the war between the states, Col. Hatch was still holding that office, but finding it necessary to take the oath imposed by the rotisti tulionat convention in order to continue in thai oilier, he declined to do so, gave up his office and soon cast his lot with his more genial com panions amid-it the flowers and ever green of tho sunny South ; which was quite natural for such a man as Col. Hatch to do, following out as he was. the dictates of conscience, patriotism and of early education. Ucre wu find him no less distinguish ed than before. At the formation of a bureau for the exchange of prisoners, Cot. Hutch was assigned to that department as assistant commissioner, and discharg ed the arduous and responsible duties of that o 111 en to tin entire satisfaction of thu Confederate authorities, re ceiving from them the very highest recommendations, and by hi1;ind and courteous disposition, and the urbanity of his manners he endeared himself to every federal otlieer and soldier who passed through his charge. Col. Hatch held this high and important position for four years, during which time there were more great acts performed than is usually crowded into one man's whole life time, having daily to transact busi ness with the greatest men of the age, and with actors of one of thi greatest drumus ever performed on the stage of the world.
