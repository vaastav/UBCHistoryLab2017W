Among the stipulations is one forbidding the cutting of more than 50 per cent of each class growing on any acre. Monthly statements, under oath, are re quired, giving descriptions of the tract from which the timber is cut, the amount cut and how disposed of. No trees shall be cut or removed less than the specified number of inches in diameter, except for needed roadways through the timber. A person cutting timber is required to cut, remove and burn or otherwise dispose of the tops and brush of the trees, etc, to prevent forest fires, and to be held liable in damages for the spread of any fire attributable to his neglect. Never was the circus, which is always a part of the drawing by lottery for seats in the house on the first day of a new congress, more enjoyed by the members and spectators than it was yesterday, and the ring-leaders in the fun were mostly the men whose nerves had been racked to their utmost tension during the long uncertain period of the speakership contest in the caucus. The gayety of the members was therefore but the natural reaction of nature. . The spectators in the galleries also took part in the sport. When the members were all huddled up in the open spaces be hind the seats and the blind-folded boy made his appearance to begin drawing the numbered marbles out of the box, such remarks as: "You'll get pulled for running a lottery," "Where's the cops" and "VVanamaker will be after you," might have been heard in all parts of the galleries and even upon the floor of the house. George Livingston, eldest son of E. J. Livingston, formerly a state senator of Oregon and member of the California assembly from Yuba county, died at his father's home in Fuenta, Cal, in dread ful convulsions and pain caued by nicotine poison. The deceased was 14 years old. For four years he had been an inveterate smoker of cigarettes. Everything that his parents could do failed to check the habit. He was sent on a trip to Japan; he was offered $1,000 to stop; he was locked in his room for two weeks at a time, but he would return to his cigarettes. For the past year he consumed over forty cigarettes a day and some days he would smoke over seventy. He even got up nights to smoke. He had been unwell foi several months and his skin assumed a peculiar yellowish hue, while his eyes became glossy and his respiration poor. His skin turned black after death. A post mortem examina tion showed that his heart had been poisoned with nicotine. Let's reason together. Here's a firm, one of the largest the country over; it has grown, stop by step, through the years to greatness and it sells patent medicines 1 ugh I "That's enough !" Wait a little This firm pays the newspapers good money (expensive work, this adver tising 1) to tell the people that they have faith in what they sell, so much faith that if they can't benefit or cure they don't want your money. Their guaran tee is not indefinite and relative, but definite and absolute if the medicine doesn't help, your money is "on call." Suppose every sick man and every feeble woman tried these medicines and found them worthless, who would be the loser, you or they ? The medicines are Dr Pierce's "Golden Medical Discovery," for blood diseases, and his "Favorite Prescription," for woman's peculiar ills. If they help hnuta.1 liiii.ltli iUn-w, 41 Oft .. I. ...

Also the report of the Secretary of the Senate showing contingent esp3nsos. Mr. Hoar expressed the opinion (in which the Vice-President concurred) that the first business was the question of administering the oath of office to Mr. Dubois of Idaho. Mr. Cullom's motion (to that effect?) was put and agreed to, and the oath was accordingly administered to Mr. Duijois. Mr. Hoar's similar motion as to Mr. Call, of Florida, was also agreed to, and the oath was administered to Mr. Call. On further motion of Mr. Hoar the papers in the matter of the credentials of Mr. Davidson (claimant for Mr. Call's seat) were referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections, with instruc tions to investigate and report at an early day, and, on motion of Mr. Hale, a like reference was made of the papers in the case of Mr. Claggeet, claiming the seat of Mr. Dubois. The Senate then, at 12:30, took a recess. Although the recess closed at 2 o'clock nothing took place until 2.35, when Mr. Kerr, the newly elected Clerk of the House, appeared and delivered a mes sage announcing that the House was organized, and ready to proceed to busi ness, and that it had appointed a com mittee of three (Messrs. lslount, Breck inridge of Kentucky, and Reed) to join a like committee on the part of the Senate to wait upon the President of the United States. Mr. Sherman suggested another recess till 3 o'clock to give an opportunity to the House Committee to meet the Sen ate Committee. This eourse was ag reed to. A few minutes before 3 o'clock the House members of the Joint Committee made their appearance, and being joined by Messrs. Sherman and Harris, pro ceeded to the White House. The Senate then adjourned. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. It Will Probably ba Submitted Vo-mor-rowr A Brief Document. Washington, Dec. 9. It is believed that the President's Message to the first session of the Fifty-second Congress will be submitted to-morrow immediately after its assemblage. The report of Secretary Foster will ba submitted on Friday. As far as financial recommend ations are concerned it is believed these two messages will be almost identical. 1 hat of the President, it; is thought, will be a comparatively brief one and the space which it will probably devote to financial matters will be short. The only financial matter of great im port which will receive the attention of the preseut Con (Treat is the silver ques tion. As i-t'gar Is this, the Administra tion wiil si Mud on the present law. Recommeadutions on this subject will not be ma le except to reiterate those of au international agreement.

THE SAWTELLE APPEAL. No Evidence Presented that the Skull Found Was Hiram's. Concord, N. H., Deo. 9. At the af ternoon session of the Sawtelle case the reading of the stenographic minutes was resumed. It included the testi mony given by Inspector Cogan, of Bos ton, who found blood stains on the buggy seat; Professor Wood, who ex amined the stains, and Dr. Ham, who examined Hiram' wounds. Several witnesses were called, who gave evi dence as to the looallty in which they heard shots on the day of the murder, after which the State rested. Counsel for Sawtelle then introduced a plan of the locality where the head was found buried. This closed the evi dence and a recess was taken until to day. Mrs. Hiram Sawtelle, who arrived last night, says her husband did net have artificial teeth, but that, on the contrary, his teeth were all right. As Dr. Grant in his testimony said when he examined the skull last Saturday there was no indication of teeth in the npper jaw, the question has been raised whether or not the skull was really Hiram's. No evidence was presented to the court identifying the skull as that of Hiram Sawtelle. The opinion is prevalent that Isaac Sawtelle' petition will be denied by the court.
