America*. Changed Statu. The problem is not an easy one. A fundamental change has taken place with reference to the posi tion of America In the world's affairs. The prejudice and pas sions engendered by decade, of controversy between two schools of political and economic thought the one believers in protection of American Industries, the other believers In tariff for revenue only?must be subordinated to the single consideration of the public Interest in the light of unex changed conditions. No policy of Isolation will sat isfy the growing needs and oppor tunities of America. ?The provin cial standards and policies of the past, which have held American business as If in a strait-Jacket, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live, a day full of hope and promise for Amer ican business, if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that are ours for the asking.

Interment at Rock Creek ?e>?tives and friends to quote from my tut mems* urging this very action: "We must eee to it that our re turning soldiers are assisted In every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done b/ developing and maintaining upon an ade quate scale the admirable organi zation created by the Department of Labor for placing men seek ing work, and it can also be done, in at least one very great field, by creating .new opportunities for individual enterprise. The Secre tary of th*f Interior has pointed out the way by which returning soldiers may be helped to find and take up Isnd in the hitherto undeveloped regions of the coun try which the Federal government hns already prepared or can read ily prepare for cultivation, and also on many of the cutover or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older States, and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shall receive the imme diate and substantial support of the Congress." Tn the matter of tariff legisla tion. I beg to call your attention to the statements contained in my last message urging legisla tion with reference to the estab lishment of the chemical and dyestuffs industry In America. Wan Id EBcoorncr Farmers. During the war the farmer performed a vital and willing sefvice to the nation. By ma terially Increasing the produc tion of his land, he supplied America and the allies with the Increased amounts of food nec essary to keep their immense ar mies In the field. He Indispen sably helped to win the war. But there is now scarcely less need of increasing the produc tion in food and the necessaries of, life. I ask the Congress to consider means of encouraging effort along thejte lines. The im portance of doing eevrything possible to promote production along economical lines, to im prove marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful, is obvious. I would call your attention to the widespread condition of po litical restlessness in our body politic. The causes of this un rest. while various and compli cated. are superficial rather thsn deep seated. Broadly, they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our goevrnment to arrive speedily at a Just and permanent peace per mitting return to normal condi tions. from the transfusion of radical theories from seething Eu ropean centers pending such de lay. from heartless profiteering resulting in the increase of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent adtators. With the return to normal conditions, this unrest will rapidly disappear. In the meantime. It does much evil. It seems to me that in deal ing with this situation Congress should not be impatient nor dras tic, but should seek rather to remove the causes. It should endeavor to brinp our country back speedily to a peace basis, with ameliorated living con ditions under the minimum of re strictions upon personal liberty that is consistent with our re construction problems. And it should arm the Federal govern ment with power to deal in its criminal courts with those per sons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested institutions. With the free ex pression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change. however fundamental, there must be no interference, but towards passion and malevo lence tending to incite crime and insurrection under guise of polit i leal evolution there should be no I leniency. Food Control Exten*lo?. I renew and strongly urge the necessity of /he extension of the present food control act as to the period of time in which it shall , remain in operation. The Attor ney Genera! has submitted a bill providing for ;?n extension of this act for a period of six months. . As it now stands it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon formal proclamation of peace. It is imperative that it should be extended at or.ee. As I pointed out 1n my last messace, publicity can accom plish a great deal in this cam paign. The aims* of the govern ment must be clearly brought to the attention of the consuming public, civic organisations and State officials, who are in a posi tion to lend their assistance to our efforts. I also renew my recommenda tion that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it 'is regulated. for example, by the laws of the State of New Jersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept be yond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date'of their receipt. No one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite program to bring about an improvement In the con ditions of labor. There can be no "settled conditions leading to in creased production and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capital are to be antagonists In stead of partners. Sound think ing and an honest desire to serve the interests of the whole nation, as distinguished from the interests of a class, must be applied to the solution of this great and pressing problem, tfhe failure of other na tions to consider this matter In a vigorous way has produced bitter ness and jealousies and antag onisms. the food of radicalism. The only way to keep men from agitat ing against grievances is to remove the grievances. An unwillingness even to discuss these matters pro duces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country which endeavor to stir up disturbances in order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. Farther Measure* Weeded. Congress has already shown its willingness to deal with these In dustrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day a* the standard In every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to prevent child la bor. It has served the whole coun try by leading the way in develop ing the means of preserving and safeguarding lives and health in dangerous industries. It must now kelp in the difficult task of finding a mMhod that will bring about a genuine democratisation of indus try. based* upon the full recogni tion of the right of those mho work, in whatever rank, to par ticipate In some organic way in every decision which directly af fects their welfare, it is with this on DMMibM- 1 to oonldcr the## problems la all their brood upMta. with the Idea of bringing about a bettor understanding between thee* two lntereeta. The great unroot throughout the world, oat of which has emerged a demand for an Immediate con sideration of the difficulties be tween capital and labor, bide us put our own house In order. Frank ly, there can be no permanent and lasting settlements between capi tal and labor which do not ? rec ognise the fundamental concepts for which labor has been strug gling through the years. To analyse the particular* In the demands of labor is to admit the justice of their complaint In many matters that lie at their basia. The workman demanda an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live in comfort, unhampered by the fear of poverty and want in hla old age. He demanda the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary surroundings, both in home and In workahop, sur roundings that develop and do not retard his own health and well being; and the right to provide for his children's wants in 4he mat ter of health and education. In other words, it is his desire to make the conditions of his life and the Uvea of those dear to him tolerable and easy to bear. Ifatloa'a Vitality Mmaced. The evidences of world-wide unrest which manifest them selves in violence throughout the world bid us pause and con sider the means to be found to stop the spread of thia conta gious thing before it saps the very vitality of the nation iteelf. Do we Rain strength by with holding the remedy? Or la It not the business of statesmen to treat these manifestations of un rest which meet us on every hand as evidences of an eeonom * 1c disorder, and to apply con structive remedies wherever necessary, being ?ure that in the application of the remedy we touch not the vital tissues of our Industrial snd economic life? There can be no recession of the tide of unrest until construc tive instrumentslities are set up to stem that tide. Governments must recognise the rlpht of men collectively to bargain for humane objects that have at their base the mutual protection and welfare of those engaged In all industries. La bor must not be longer treated as a commodity. It must be re garded as the activity of human I beings, possessed of deep yearn j ings and desires. The business man gives his best thought to the repair and replenishment of his machinery, so that its use | fulness will not be impaired and its power to produce may al ways be at its height and kept In full vigor and motion. No less regard ought to be paid to the human machine, which after all propels the ma chinery of the world and is the great dynamic force that lies back of all industry and prog ress. Return to the old stand ards of wage and industry \n employment are unthinkable. L*bor not only Is entitled to an adequate wage, but capital should receive a reasonable return upon its Investment and is entitled to protection at the hands of the gov ernment In every emergency. 5?o government worthy of the name can "play" these elements against each other, for there Is a mutual ity of Interest between them which the government must seek to ax press and to safeguard at all cost. The right of Individuals to strike is Inviolate and ought not to be In terfered with by any process of government, but there is a pre j dominant right and that is the right of the government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the * challenge of any daas. I In the matter of International ; deputes which have led to war, statesmen have sought to set up as ; a remedy arbitration for war. i Does this not point the way for | the settlement of industrial dis , putes by the establishment of a i tr.bunal. fair and Just alike to all. which will settle industrial dis putes which in the past have led to ' war and disaster? America** Hoar of Teat. This is the hour of test and trial ! for America. By her prowess and strength and the indomitable cour ace of her soldiers, she demon strated her power to vind.cate on foreign battlefields her conceptions of liberty and Justice Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concern be pro claimed to the world. There are those in this coun try who threaten direct action to force their will upon a major ity. Russia today, w ith its blood and terror, is a painful object lesson of the power of minori ties. It makes little difference what minority it is. whether capital or labbr or any other class, no sort of privilege will ever he permitted to dominate this country. We are a partner ship or nothing that is worth while. We are a democracy, where the majority are the mas ters. or all the hopes and pur poses of the men who founded this government have been de feated and forgotten. In Amer ica there is but one way by which great reforms can be ac complished and the relief sought by classes obtained, and that is through the orderly processes of representative government. Those who would propose sny other method of reform are ene mies of this country. America will not be daunted by threats nor lose her composure or calm ness in these distressing times. We can afford, in the midst of this day of passion and unrest, to be self-contained and sure. The instrument of all reform in America is the ballot. The road to economic and social reform In America Is the straight road of justice to all classes and con ditions of men. Men have but to follow this road to realize the full fruition of their objects and purposes. Let those beware who would take the shorter road of disorder and revolution. The right road ia the road of Jus tice and orderly process.
