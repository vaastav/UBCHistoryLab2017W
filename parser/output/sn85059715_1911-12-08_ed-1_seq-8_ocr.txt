In the light of President Taft's message to Congress on the subject, it seems very much like the cry to repeal the Sherman anti-trust law Is a wall p behalf of the big interests I and the monopolists. It is a bark backward instead of a cry of_ progxessiveness. The president plainly showed that' the supreme court decrees in the Standard Oil and American Tobaccp; trust cases have been effectual in t breaking up these monopolies. The. trusts were dissolved, the holding companies were required to dlstrib-' ute stock of subsidiary companies; among the stockholders and were forbidden to acquire the stock of the concerns again, certain parts of; business engaged In solely b? certain ; companies were distributed amon?: various concerns so as To make com-; petition not only possible but nec-| essary, and the different corpora-! tions were enjoined from conspiring:' |i or combining to restore any monop-; oly. ?r; It Js not the purpose of the; law as newly construed to con-, flscate property, nor to prohibit tlje i transaction of business merely be-j cause of its size but simply to prevent the stifling of competition, the enhancing of prices and the estab-, lishment of a monopoly when such Is the purpose or necessary effect of j the maintenance of a combination j of immense size. Even if any of tl the stockholders of tlie remaining companies of the dissolved trusts should attempt by concerted action of their companies to control the market they would immediately be; subject to contempt proceedings! I and imprisonment or a summary character. E The Sherman anti-trust law tan be amended and the president be- j' Iicves certain amendments would) be of distinct advantage. such as p prohibiting a corporation from bold-j ine the stock of other corporations alnd providing for other regulations and limitations under a federal incorporation act. But, when any one f seeks by a repeal of the anti-trusty I laws to undo all the good work! that has been done and start all : oyer again when the experiences Of two decades have brought us to actual realization of effectiveness In the way of legal suppression, it is well to look to the motives thereof and see whose axe is be'ng ground. jl- Those Pipe Dreams. Certain Washington correspond-, ents to newspapers in this state arej imposing on the latter as shown by what is purely fancy on their part ! Por instance, the last two daysj those correspondents have had Virgil iL>. Highland, of this city, chair-1 man of the State .Republican Cora-' mittee, holding conferences with. President Taft and others. One of the correspondents, a protege of "Jlmmie" VVier, a private secretary' to a United States Senator, has been j bold enough to make the declaration under his own name. First, they had Mr. Highland rushing to Washington to tell former Senator Nathan .11. Scott that ho must run for governor and then they proceeded to say that Highland and, t Scott had actually held a conference in Washington, not-withstand-, ing Scott was in Whccl ng at the I time and Highland in Clarksburg. ! EV Fallowing this they declared that Chairman Highland had just called j on the President At the time they had Mr (Highland dons this, he doubtless ^yis in his home here, sound asleep At any rate he **3S| in ClarkBburg and not in Washing-, ton. Some of these correspondents' [ A Perl l j i Cent ins mistaken, unless they resort to saying they got tfifvrrottg Information. Such . a statement -wonld convict them of unreliability in getting [facts as a 'basis of -their taniry writing. Am seen from this angle, the truth seems to be that they, thought the state chairman would be in Wa*hingtqp about the time of the opening of Congress and it was impossible to get it from their minds other than to erroneously declare that he was there. So palpable is their misstatements in these instances, that they discredit their otber political writings. The Rainbow (hasem. A great deal of wind jamming comes from ^Democratic space killers ,in Washington these days about the, wonderful things the (Democrats are. going to do in Congress and about, the roseate chanc^p their party has: of riding a candidate into the: presidential chair at tble next elee-, tlon. These tales, however, are butj fantasies that will rapidly be dls-j pelled. tin the first place, it Is not likely; the Democrats -will do much of anything but quarrel over factional differences during the present session i of the Congress. The Democrats are always going to do something but never do it, only when they are! assured that what they do will go for naught. In the second place, the most of the Democrats who have already nominated, elected and Inaugurated a 'Democratic president are in the same class with the rain- j bow chasers. .Of course, with their majority In the House and their late Senate ac-; cessions, the (Democrats have gone back to Washington in more buoyant spirits than they have possessed in many a day. The sanguine jiembers of the clan, like Tom 'Hetlin, of Alabama, and Ollle James, of Kentucky, think they have already elected a president. Xo sort of reasoning enters into their calculations. for they are of the rainbow-? chasing brotherhood who always prognosticate a Democratic victory simply because they want it that way. The rude jars they have been getting all these years interfere not] at all with their vauntings. . They do not take into account sev-' eral important factors, first being' the matter of^tlme. The election of a .president is nearly a year away, and between now and then much water will flow over the dam. With in a twelve-month the voters cr America will have time for digest-ng the record of the present White , House incumbent and doing justice to a singularly pure and broadmined executive. Another thing that the rainbow-1 chasers of the James Heflin school do not take into consideration is that the American people are dear lover* of that trait which Mr. Taft is al jjgrfect exemplar?a candor that is absolute. The very fact that the President's want of guile has led him to say that he has made mis-j takes is going to be a tower ofj' strength. The opposition may; chuckle all it pleases, but the si-j leiit, thoughtful citizen thinks tremendously more of the president who says that he occasionally errs than of the politician who is ever hiding things that may be to his own detriment. The 'President Is' as honest as the day is long and knowing his frankness and sincerity. the mass of his countrymen are willing to trust the man they know to one who may be all right and' -??'? ttiqv not. The Taft who' iucu aiju.u is open anil above board, who Is straight and true and who is faith-1 ful to his ideals "is the man to whom tha favor and confidence of his countrymen will revert with such a watte of sympathetic ac-| knowledgment that his prolongation of official life. Is easy to foretell. Inspector Needed. A prominent citizen suggests that Clarksburg should have an inspector of weights and measures, and he ex-, presses surprise that a city of so much uptodateness did not long since create an oflice of that kind. i The establishment of such an of-' ? ? l'4 Vto ? rnflpftinn Oil tllC UCC
