Gangs of Greek laborers are working nlongsido of allied soldiers in throw ing up earthworks. On tho heights t'ommaudiiig approaches to tho city, the allies' artillery has been stationed, and the railway to the north has been mined to prevent the central forces from hnvintr a clear road. Three trans ports debarked their forces yesterday. The allies at Salonika hnvo no doubt Hint the central troops will invade (ireece in force within a few days. Nevertheless Greeks here doubt that the Teutons and their Bulgar cohorts will attempt such a move. Those hold ! this view say that tho Germans realize Hint nu attempt to dislodge the allies at Salonika would bo hopeless. Tiie newspapers declare that not a single Ttulgnr soldier will be allowed on Greek soil. Haig Succeeds French. London, Dec. 16. With Sir John Vreiich no longer commanding British forces on the western battle front and General Sir Dowlas Ifnig named to .succeed him, tho changes in the Brit ish forces have only started, it was liinted today. Sir John French retired at his own request, and will be commnnder of forces in the United Kingrom. While there will probably be no vio lent shnkeup, a gradual replacing of f ield commanders is apparently slated before the expected spring offensive starts. Those responsible for the fail uro before Loos in the "big drive" last September will be transferred to less important posts. The appointment, of Irnig to the chief command in Prance and Flanders was hailed enthusiastically oy the pub lie, today. Tho change came as no sur prise, for the wave of criticism that liad been directed against Earl Kit chener turned toward General French ifter tho Loos combat. Sir John, how ever, retains the friendship of the pub lic even though he does not hold its confidence. Haig is a Scotchman 54 years old, with a record behind him for service in Africa, the Sudan and Indin. In the present operations he has Vieon men tioned in praise by Field Marshal French several times. French is past 60, and his record, too, is excellent, though of late stories had circulated that he had men upon his staff who were unqualified for profer ment. Italians To Aid Serbia. Paris, Bee. 16. That Italian troops nnd munitions hnvo landed in Albania ind are moving to the relief of the Serbians was indicated today in a Homo dispatch admitting destruction of the Italian destroyer Intrepido nnd the transport Remberto by drifting mines in the Adrintie. The message dated that 43 perished, and declared the losses were so light because ship loads of men nnd material had nlready reached their destination' unharmed. From this, it was taken that the des tination was Albania. These Helping Austrians. Vienna, Dec. 16.

The allies' retreat from Serbia has killed all prospects of Rumania joining them, according to Bucharest advices today. Where a few weeks ago, there seemed a strong pro test of their aligning with the entente powers, a couseryutive lender was re ported now to have suggested in audi ence with the king that the time is now ripo for Rumania to joiu the central powers and invndo Bessarabia, which Rumania covets. Theso dispatches suggested that the Russian concentration ou the Rumanian border is to offset a possible invasion by Rumanians rather than for the pur poso of invading Bulgaria themselves.

Shepherd. (United Press staff correspondent.) Sulouikn, Dec. 10. A million Serbian girls and women are facing terrible suf feringand possibly death for lack of food and clothing, or a fate worse than death nt tho hands of roving comitadjis (irregulurs) not yet entirely suppressed by the invaders. Well clothed and well fed allied sol diers have suffered severely from the cold in southern Serbia. But what is happening to the women of the Serbian army left behind the world can only guess. Serbia ordered her men nnd boys to leave the villages nnd join the retreat ing army; she ordered the women to re main and care for the villages. In other countries, women bado good bye their men and saw them go away to war; but Serbia's heroines said fare well to their men and then waited for the war to come to them with all its horrors and outrages. It is not the refugees who fled into the snows of Albania, who are suffering the most. It is the helpless women and girls in Serbia's nameless homes. They are ut the mercy of the winter and the prey of guerillas. If they are to be aided it must be by America, for refugees said that America alone can find out what, is actually happening in Serbia and send aid through Germany, as in the case of Belgium. The relief appeal made by Madame Groytch through the United Press re cently has proven effective. Particular ly strong was the relief sent by west ern and middle western American cities. But the donations were misdirected to American Consul John Kehl here. With foodstuffs and $.10,000 in cash telegraphed to him, he is puzzled to know what to do with these supplies, inasmuch as he cannot inaugurate relief mensures from here. Today he asked the United Press to tell Americans that Serbian relief must go through Ger many. Supplies for Serbians. New York, Dec. 10.

(United Press staff correspondent.) London, Dec. 10. Back from the Ser bian "trail of horrors," Lady Sybil Finltiy todny related a story of bruvery ou the part of Dr. Richard Jett, Amer ican physician and Matron Anna Dull when Pirot, Serbia, was under fire. "It seemed as though the hospital in which they were would be blown to pieces," she said, "for the Bulgar gun ners made buildings nearby their spe cial target. But tho two refused to leave their charges. L'ven when the city was evacuated, the two insisted on remaining even if alone to care for the more desperately wounded. But the au thorities insisted that they leave. They were under fire for several hours while the wounded were being removed to a train bound for Nish." From Nish, tho party again had to flee. Finally, they hit the "trail of horrors," and Lady Finlny came hero from (Salonika. For his bravery, Dr. Jett has been made a cflptalu in the Serbian army. i i NO CHANCE THIS SESSION ' Washington, Dee. 16.

In this matter, Aus tria refused to accept Serbia's profes sion, of ignorance as to anti-Austrinii propaganda in Serbia and answered Ser bia's demands for information with the statement that Serbia showed she was unwilling to comply seriously with Aus tria's demands. At the snme time, Vienna flatly refused to engage in a controversy with Belgrade. Some of ficials regarded the cases as more or less parallel. Austila Does Not Answer. Amstordam, Dec. 16. Austria has fniledto meet the American dcniiind for disnrowal of the sinking by nn Aus trian submarine of the Itiilinn liner An conn with loss of American lives. Vien na dispatches today said that the reply was handed to Amhnssndor Peufield yesterday, asking further time and more negotiations, It was reported, too, that Austria did not reply to the request for punishment of the nttackiug submarine commander and nsserted it would never do this. The tone of the note, however, is conciliatory. It desires nn cxchuiign of views with the idea of arriving nt an amicable settlement, ninl expresses re gret that American lives i were sacri ficed, In this connection, the message suggests thnt the Indemnity question can be oaslly settled after an agreement is reached ou the principal issues. A clesrer statement of reasons for questioning the submarine eomnuinilei 's acts is suggested. Moreover, dispatches declare, the foreign office suid that, In viow of the firmness with which Amer ica voiced her demands, she must 4inve actual f lift n concerning the torpedoing which she did not set forth III detuil in the original note; therefore, she re quests the United Slates to present them in another note.

MEET DEMANDS 0 THEUNITEDSTATES VOICE FR OM BELONGING ADVISES 8. S. Oscar II, Radio via Cape Race. At a mass meeting held aboard Henry Ford's Peace Ship, Tuesday evening, December 7th, 8. 8. McClure, tho em inent mngazino publisher and publicist, read important extracts from President Wilson's message, nn advanced copy of which Mr. McClure had obtained before sailing. After tho readings, Mr. Ellis O. Jones, ono of the delegates spoke as follows: I certaiuly do not believe this mes sage should be received in silence by this assemblage. This is a reactionary message; this message como to us at a time when we cannot keep silent; we muBt speak out; we are going, abroad now, on a mission to stop a terrible war among nations, everyone of which is prepared in a military way pre pared for war. This is no time to dis turb American Traditions and prepare us for war, a member of this delegation said tonight, that, preparation in tho military sense is only a century old, but this is not correct. -Preparation In the military sense is many 1 centuries old, tho ancient histories are full of it; preparation in a pence senso, how ever, preparation in a civil sense is not so old. 1 call your attention to the preparation tor pence, that now exists in the United States and Canada. Where there are no forts, where there are no soldiers, where there are no trenches or guns, that is preparation for peace, and that is about a conturv old. A preparation for peace exists between Norway and Sweden. There is no lort between thoir frontiers, and that is tho kind of preparation we need now. America is in danger, but of what is she in danger, The president does not say in his messago of what America ib in danger. At this tune the president, does not mention a single nation that he dares to" sav is an en emy of the United States of America, nut tho united hWtes of America is in lunger none the less. It is in dnnizCr of enemies from within and they arc not naturalized enemies cither, ' thev are the men, who are building buttle- snips ut tremendous profits; men who nre trying now, to add to the burden of tnxatiou of tho United States of America and to mortgage posterity, for years. to come. To fasten this dreadful miltarv burden upon us, they aro tell ing us thnt we want to chinnfy Am contained in the note allows numerous doubts nnd gives not at all sufficient reasons for blaming the commander of the submarine and the Austrn-Hungnr-iun government, even if the represen tation proves correct in all points and judgment, in the case is based on the most rigorous legal interpi'otation." As tor the American statement thnt persons gave it evidence contradictory ot Austrian claims concerning the tor pedoing, the dispatches suy the note suggested Sccretury Lansing had omit ted to name these parties upon whom it apparently believes it must place a higher degree of trustworthiness than on a commander of the imperial royal navy." The Vienna foreign office admits its willingness to indulge in un exchange of opinion In view of America's an nouncement that some American citi zens perished. Un the point raised by VYasningtnn that Austria knew of tho correspond ence with Germany relative to subma rine warfare, dispatches say lennn denied she knew nil of it. Moreover, even n full knowledge, Vienna believed, would not be applinnble to the Anconi' case, which, she felt, differed from the others. For this reason, according to the ad vices,' the reply left It up to Washing ton to draw up "the individual legal maxims," upon which America bases her contentions, nt the snme time re serving the right to urge her own In terpretations of the case. To Make New Demand. Washington, Dec. 1U. Another and more peremptory demand for disavowal of the Austrian torpedoing of the Ital ian linef Aiicona was under considera tion by the administration today. Out lines of Austria's reply to the first strong demand were pronounced evuslve und unsatisfactory. The new nuto will curtly insnt upon nn immediate compliance with Amer- icn 's demands. This will cite the Austriun admiralty admission that the ship wns deliberate ly sunk while passengers were aboard nnd the debarking passengers were shelled with sufficient evidence sustain ing America's position.

THE DEEP TO JONES PRESIDENT erica, that we are all mollycoddles. It may be true, that every mollycoddle is a pacifist, but, it is not true, that ev ery pacifist is a mollycoddle and this, wo are going to show President Wilson and the Armament trusts of the United States of America, before we are through. (Applause.) It is not true perhaps, that everyone, who favors pro parcducss in the Unitod States is a grafter, but nothing can be truer than, that every grafter in the United States is in favor of preparedness; every cor poration lawyer in the United Stntos is in favor of preparedness. Joseph II. Chontc, the other day, had the super lative impertinence to say that he had considored this matter, that he had got ten the facts from military authorities and had found that America was not prepared in any single respect or in any particular. Was ever thoro a more absurd statement made by any man than this one, from a great Interna tional lawyort America is prepared now if you want a military preparedness- it is very, very simple. Those men do not want a military prepared ness, what they want is a great mili tary profit. (Applause.) If we want to prepare ourselves, it is the simplest thing in tho world. Germany has spent a great, amount of money upon its fleet, its wonderful navv. ' Now how does it go about to protect that fleet! By the very very simple provision of having mined tho harbor, a very simplo nnd inexpensive matter, but mines in the harbor offer vory littlo profit to tho steel trust, very little profit too, in deed. Tliero is vastly more money lh battleships. I do not want to take too much of your time,. I am about through, but I feel this matter deeply and be fore I am through, I want to say, that we, this body of enrnostr unselfish mon and women should spcuk in no uncer tain terms about this message. We uro, as President Wilson suid, "for nation al efficiency nnd security,' but thnt is not the way to go about to got thnt; by turning our host energies to the mulling of murderous instruments of destruction; by sending our best men into vile barracks and muddy trenches and by turning over the public treas ury to a lot of profit mongers, who are not actuated by the slightest patriotic impulse whatsoever. (Applause,) 

'HK.NRV FOBD. Would Employ Men In Doing Needed Work While Being . Drilled Washington, Dec. 1(1. An army edu cated in engineering und hardened to the rights of campaigning through the task of reclaiming deserts, reforesting large western tracts and protecting the Mississippi valley from floods was ad vocated by Senator Works of Califor nia, today, in tho senate. Such an army, ho suid, would dissi piite the evils of unnrcpiiredness anil foreover obviato tho danger of ercnting a military caste. It would provide, too, an army of soldiers engaged in useful work instead of in becoming idlers. The government could spend flnO.OOO, 000 a yenr thus that really would cost it "nothing," ho suggested, nt the snme time proposing paying the soldiers with trncts of tho public lands their labors improved. "Because the greater pnrt of the re clamation work naturally falls In the western states," e snld, "nnd be cause the west is in tho greatest danger of invasion from tho Japanese, who have more veteran soldiers on the l'n cific coast than nre in our stun. ling army, this force would do most of its work In the west. -But where work is needed in the enst, the army should be employed there.

POULTRY SHOW STARTS WAR OF WORDS President Hamilton Intimates Halt Must Be Called On Expenditures When Benjamin Brick proposed that his motion to change the name of the Salom Commercial club to that of the Salem Chamber of Commerce should bo made unanimous, ho started something that led to a flow of oratory that con tinued for three hours, and finally re sulted in an indefinite postponement, on a rising vote of 40 to 0. As it now . stands tho Commercial club will con- . tinuo to travel uuder tho name adopted whon tho club wns re-orminized last summer, although Mr. Brick insists tho game will be played a few more in nings. Not only was a flow of Commercial club oratory turned looso, but thoBo ac customed to tho more peaceful ways of life, arose and registered all sorts of kicks as to why certain things wer done, nnd why tho merchants were cnll od on for donations when it was under stood last summer at tho re-organization thnt the payment of dues prevent ed nil street solicitations. When Mr. Brick distributed a littl. card in which a few words wore said about being a live ono and not a Kip Van Winkle,' he aroused the fighting spirit of the old guard. Mr. Hucke st.ein didn't like the idea or suggestion. "We have men just as live as any found in Oregon. The name will do nothing for us. In fact, you will have to show me that our success depends on a chango in name," said Mr. liucke- stein. The Eov. R. F. Tischer rather liked tho old name better and could not see that tile chango of name would benefit the club. Would Exhaust Club's Energy. Judge 1'. II. D'Arcy expressed th opinion thnt a new fungled name or any high sounding titlo would be of no ben efit. The ltip Van Winkles of this club wish to return the present name. If we uso too much of our energy in changing our inline, we won 't amount to any thing," said Mr. D'Arcy. "Everything is rininiHg too smooth and there are no arguments," declured Mr. Brick, when given a chance to dis i'.uss Iub proposed nmendmunt. "These littlo cards about ltip Van Winkle, and ubout being n live one, wore distributed just to arouse a little enthusiasm." Notwithstanding his eloquent idea for the chnngo of name, and tun pocket ful of proxies, which, us Mr. Brick said, were from the leading men of tho city, his motion for the clinuge was lost, and for the present the Conunerciul club wll bo known us the Coinmerciil club. As to whether n man should vote by prpxy was iinotlier proposition thnt turned looso floods of oratory. The general opinion prevailed that proxies were ii bud thing for any legislative or deliberative body.
