The Situation in Honolulu Unchanged. Queen Lil Not Yet Restored to Her Throne. The Minister Is Afraid to Carry Out His Instructions. He Finds That They Are Inapplicable to the State ot Affair* In the Islands — Tho Annoxett lata Greatly Mated, By the Atsoclated Press. Poet Townsknd, Wash.. Dec. 4.—Tbe Barkentine Kiikitat, Captain Cutter, arrived today from Honolulu with ad vices to November 20tb, tour days after the steamer Alameda sailed for Ban Francisco. Minister Willis submitted to en inter- ! view directly after the Alameda sailed, in which he said that the instructions from the United Stages government which he brought from Washington were not applicable to the condition of affairs existing at the islands. This statement gave the annexationists much satisfaction and the royalists were as much displeased. On account of many rnmors enrrent of an uprising oi the queen's supporters, tbe provisional government found it necessary to keep two companies of soldiers under arms for several .nights after the Alameda sailed. The editor of the Evening Star re quested Minister Willis to submit a statement to the public to allay tbe general feeling of uncertainty. In tbe published interview Willis said: "Yes, I believe tbat the time has come wben it is tight end proper for me to use my discretion in this matter. You are authorized to say ior me that no change in the present situation will take place for several weekß. I brought witb me certain instructions from the United States government on the Ha waiian situation. Since my arrival con tingencies have aiisen about which neither the United States government the oxerc.ee of the discretion allowed me, to submit theße matters to Wash ington before proceeding further to carry out my original instructions. I for warded my dispatches to Washington by today's steamer, and until 1 receive an answer to them, no change will take place in tbe present situation, nor will any be allowed." "What do you mean by the expres sion 'nor will any be allowed'?" "I mean just this: That until the time comes for me to carry out my in structions the peace and good order of this community will be kept undis turbed in the interests of humanity; that any attempt made by any person or persons to make trouble will be promptly checked and punished. You may put the matter more plainly and say that even if the provisional govern ment discharged all its troops today no lawlessness would be allowed for one moment under the present situation of affaire. The whole Hawaiian question is in abeyance and nothing that the newspapers can say or do wiil aiterthe situation one iota. I make this state ment on my own responsibility and in the hope that it will allay tha present i excitement. No one need fear trouble j and no lawlessness will be permitted." After this statement rumors began to fly about that the queen's supporters would make a final rully in her behalf. Two companies of troops remained under arras and the crews of the United States man-of-war Philadelphia and Adams were held in readiness to be landed oua moment's notice. The queen's advocate came out next day withadenialof the Willis interview, Baying he was miequoted, and by infer ence gave encouragement to the idea that Willie had or would receive imperative orders to restore the queen. The newspapers containing Blount's report had not reached the islands when the Kikital sailed, but on account of Willis' intimation relative to his in structions, it was surmised tbat it would be partial to the Queen's interests. 

WILDER GREATLY PLEASED. The Hawaiian Coimul RrceWttl the Newa from Honolulu. San Francisco, Dec. 4.—Hawaiian Consul Wilder, when he read the news which arrived tonight from Honolulu via Port Towneend, waß greatly pleased. When asked what unexpected contin gencies Minister WHlib had found in Honolulu, he said: "I thinkithnt he found that tho men composing the provisional government oi Hawaii were high-minded, iaw abi.iiug citizens, instead of fililmeterers, such as ha liiid been led to belie ;e them to be. "ibis newo," continued Wilder, "will have a great effect on the people of the United States, and I hope the adminis tration will be forced by popular opinion to change ite views on the Hawaiian question. President Cleveland's statement in hia message to congreßSthat he had received nodehnite news from Willis does B oem to be corroborated by what Mr, Willis has said in his interview published in tbe Hawaiian papers." 

REVISED INSTRUCTIONS. The Administration About to Change Its Hawaiian Policy. Washington, Dec. 4.—Secretary Greshain declined tbis morning to talk in regard to the publiahed report that the revenue cutter Corwin was to carry a message for tbe state department irom San Francisco to Honolulu. There is reason to suppose, however,that the story is substantially correct. Gresham was busy yesterday with dispatches which aro to go on the Corwin. Of what these contain, nothing can be learned. The fact of dispatching the Corwin so hastily leads to the surmise that the adminis tration has changed ita policy toward the ialands. THE CORWIN SAILS. Her Destination Believed to Be the Sandwich Islands. San Francisco, Dec. 4.—The United States revenue cutter Corwin sailed shortly* before midnight tonight. Her destination is secret, bat it is eupposed she is truing to Honolulu with instruc tions for Minister Willis. It is reported one of the sailors on the Corwin has been bribed to take dispatches from Minister Thurston to President Dole. The captain of the Corwin refused to | take letters from Consul Wilder, saying j he did not know where he was going. 

THIS X VANS TI'.IAL. oont*a'e Stepfather Forbids the Use of His Name. Fresno, Dec. 4.—The incident of the Evane trial today was the receipt by Judge Harris of a telegram from W. J. Sontag of Mankato, Minn., stepfather of the Sontag boys. Tne message read: "Judge Harris—l forbid you using Sontag's name in your court as his. His name ie Conant. Take notice." The day's proceedings were nnovent ful, most of the time being devoted to the testimony of men who were mem bers of the pursuing posse, and the story of trie battle at Young's cabin was several times retold. Frank Burke, deputy sheriff of Yuma county, Ari zona, said the posse bad no idea that Evans and Sontag were in the cabin. There was no understanding among the party to shoot at sight. They would not bave shot had not tbe robbers opened fire. Shot by His Neighbor. San Diego, Dec. 4.—John Stanovich, a farmer living near Lusardi, was shot and probably fatally wounded by his neighbor, Gustav Landman, on Sunday. Landman waß afraid his fruit trees would be injured by a tire Stanovich bad kindled to dispose of some brush, snd being unable to induce him to de sist, got a shot gun and discharged both barrels into his breaet. Landman ia in jail at Del Mar. THE 'STR'TVU! srfrrWoxT. IT ASSUMES A NEW PHASE ON THE LEHIGH.

Hazklton, Pa., Dec. 4.—The strike situation assumed a new pha- >.c tonight, not anticipated by the Lei,igh Valley ofliciale, and aB the reeult the latter are greatly embarrassed. This waa a move ment on the part of the telegraph ope rators which closed up the most im portant offices between Delano and Hajeiton. This includes the night dispatcher and two other offices of the company here. Tonight a meetii);; is being held by the strikers, and by tomorrow it is ex pected their ranks will be largely in creased. The situation now is in the strikers' favor. Most of the men who quit tonight are non-union men, and the Btrikers ere confident they wiil be able to induce new men from taking their places. Bithlkhkm, Pa., Dec. 4.—-A confer ence between the joint arbitrators' committee, representing the boards of the states of New York and New Jersey, on the one band and representatives of' tne Lehigh Valley strikers on the other, waa begun here this afternoon. With out reaching a definite conclusion, the conference adjourned till evening.

The Regular Session Opened Yesterday. Most of the Members Respond to Roll Call. The President's Message Received and Laid on the Table. The Reading of the Document Followed With Great Interest—Some Minor Business Transacted In Both Houses. By the Associated Press. Washington, Dec. 4.—The first senate session of the fifty-third congress assem bled at noon. On many desks were floral tributes from the admirers of the respective occupants. Vice-Preßident Stevenson had been remembered with a large bouquet of roses ; a bunch of roses lay on the desk of Dolph, and the doughty champion of the white metal, Stewart, was the recipient of a basket of beautiful Marechal Neils. The galleries were well filled and a touch oi color was lent to the scene by the bright winter toilets of the ladies present. After the vice-preßident's gavel fell, the blind chaplain was led to the desk and delivered eloquent prayer. Roll call showed 6t3 senators present. After the passage of tbe usual resolution notifying the house of the meeting of the eenate and the appointment of a committee to join a like committee from the house to wait on the president and notify him of the assembling of con gress, and one fixing the time of meeting at noon eacb day, the eenate took a re- Qesß of an hour to enable tbe committee to wait on the president. At tbe expiration of the recess, the Benate reconvened. A message was re ceived from the houee of the appoint ment of a committee to wait on tbe president, and another receßß of 20 min utes was taken. On reassembling the committee to wait on the president announced the accomplishment of its duty, and that the president would at once communi cate with the senate. Secretary Pruden then stepped forward and delivered the message to the vice-president, who laid it before the houße, and Secretary Cox at once began its reading. All present, with few exceptions, gave close attention when the reading began. Dolph gave attention to his old file of bills for a few moments, but pricked up his ears as the reading reached the i Hawaiian pa*agraph. There was a m^^SSton*^ 1 pMi. "ofVe* document dealing with Hawaii was ap proached. Many senators had, how ever, anticipated the secretary's read ing by turning tbeir printed copies. After this there was an evident failing off in interest, but attention briefly re vived when the paragraph concerning bonds was reached. When thie was paeeed the senators gradually left their seats and driited into the cloak rooms, so tbat by the time the reading' was two-thirds concluded only 25 senators in the chamber, and the majority of these were engaged in conversation among themselves. The reading was concluded at 3 o'clock, having occupied an hour and a half. Dolph immediately rose and Baid there bad been distributed in the sen ate printed copies of what purported to be the message of the president in which, on page nine, he found part of the page devoted to Hawaii. He did not hear that portion read from the desk. He desired to know, and thought the country did also, whether that part was inadvertently or purposely omitted by the ••I'cretary, or whether the copies mhich had been circulated were not true copies of tbe message. The vice-president responded that the portion of the message relating to Ha waii had been inadvertently omitted by the aecretary, and directed that it be read. This waa done arid Dolph gave not.cc that he would tomorrow address the Benate on that portion of tho mes sage. The message was ordered to lie on the table. Numerous potftionr were presented and many bills introduced and referred. A joint resolution permitting (Jol. Anßon Mille, U. S. A., to serve an an engineer on the commission to survey and fix the boundary between the United States and Mexico, was paused. A message received from the house, announced the deaths of O'Neill and Lilley, late representatives from Penn sylvania. Cameron, of Pennsylvania, offered a resolution expressive of the sorrow of the senate. Ihe chair ap pointed r cor..:: ittee to ottend the funeral, and as an additional mark of respect, at 3:53 Uie senate adourne •. 

OPENING OF THE HOUSE. Hindi Interest Taken In the Reading of the President.. Message. Washington, Dec. 4. —The galleries were filled when Speaker Crisp rapped the house to order at noon, witb fully 300 members in their seats. Conspicu ous among tbe vacancies, on account of tbeir chairs being draped in mourning, were the seats of Congressmen O'Neill and Lilley of Pennsylvania, the Key stone etate being cut two short of its full representation by death. The chap lain delivered a prayer, after which the roll waß called. The roll call showed 240 members preeent. N. S. Bundy of Ohio, elected to suc ceed the late Representative Enochs, appeared before the bar of the house and took tbe oath of office. A resolution waß passed notifying the senate that the house was ready to pro cued to business and appointing a committee to await on the president. Griffin, successor to the late Repre sentative Chipman of Michigan wae sworn in.. Variouß reports of bureau officers were formerly laid before the house. The committee on appropriations 

TWELVE PAGES. asked unanimous consent for considera tion of tbe bill appropriating $50,000 additional to pay the salaries of officials for the enforcement of the Chinese de portation and registration act. Agreed to. Hines of Pennsylvania asked unani mous consent for consideration of a resolution for the appointment of a committee to investigate the Lehigh railway strike. Kilgore of Texas ob jected and the resolution was referred. A recess was then taken till 1:10 p.m. At 1:20 the committee to wait on the president reported its duty discharged, and tbat the president would shortly communicate with tho house in writing. Ten minutes later Secretary Purden appeared with the message, and Clerk Kerr began to read it. The reading was listened to with marked attention. During the reading of the first portion of tbe message relating to our foreign relations. ex-Speaker Thomaß B. Reed burst through a side door and came running across the area in front of the speaker's rostrum. When he reached his seat he deliberately lighted a cigar and sat pufhngaway complacently while the reading proceeded. As reference to the Hawaiian affair was reached the members straightened up and gave rhe closest possible attention, but no ex pression of either approval or disap proval waß indulged in. There seemed to be a general air of disappointment, however, that so little space was allotted to this question. The recommendations relative to an international monetary conference and the request for further authority for the issue of bonds caused many significant shakes of the heed on the part of the silver men. The preaident's bold endorsement of the pension policy of the interior de partment, of civil service reform, and hia appeal for rigid economy in appro priations, also attracted attention. When the reference to tbe tariff was reached the members crowded about the clerk's desk. The forceful utter ance relative to tbe duty of congress on tariff and tbe hearty endorsement given the Wilson bill eeemed to please the Democratic members greatly, but much surprise waß evident when the section of the message waa read stating that the ways and moans committee had em braced in its plan several additional internal revenue taxes and a small tax on the incomes of certain corpora tions. Ac it wae understood the inter nal revenue features and income tax bad not been absolutely decided upon, the president's announcement came in the nature of a aurpriae. A roar of ap plause greeted the conclueion of the reading. General Bingham, who had been aelected by the Penneylvania delegation to make the announcement, of the deaths of Representatives O'Neill and Lilley, waß then recognized. A committee was appointed to attend the funeral of the late Representative O'Neill of Pennsylvania, and at 3 p. m., ac a further mark of respect, the house adjourned, MIS.

Czar Reed Makes Some Caustic Criticisms. He Thinks Grover Is Somewhat of au Autocrat Himself. Representatives and Brnstnri Elprail Their View* Freely—Comment of the Press Ia In the Main Unfavorable. By tne Associated Press. Washington, Dec. 4.—Views of the members oi both houses of congress concerning the president's message are freely expressed. Ex-Speaker Reed said: "It is ex ceedingly disappointing, both in matter and manner. On the Hawaiian ques tion we are left as much in the dark as ever and must wait for tbe news by tbe next eteamer, just as we have been waiting so iong. That part of the mes sage which relates to the tariff assever ates that the house committee in charge of that subject has formulated plana and devised methods of taxation which, as a momber of the committee, I have not even heard proposed. It is a rather unusual sensation to learn of the deeds of the committee, not in the committee room, but from the president of the United States. Has that committee ceased in form to be composed oi both parties, and haa it, without even the formality of a word in open committee, informed the presi dent of its determination in euch a way that the preeident ccn offi cially communicate it to tbe bouse? How long has it been part of our system tbat a committee of an independent bianch, and above all, tbe committee which controls tbe purse, Bhall report to congress through the president? Is thiß tbe result of the rumored blending of the apDointive with the legislative power? It is bad enough to have the tariff bill made up by a little coterie, but to have it communicated to the president before it reaches even the committee, still less the bouse, shows a determination to be moved by no facts and modified by no arguments which makes apparent the absurdity of ap pointing Republicans on the committee on ways and means at all." 

HOUSE OPINIONS. Mr. Springer approved the reference to Hawaii us the only course consistent . with ' ntff'mr«tf nrrl -*-frnfrr end comity. Mr. Holman eaid : "It is an able and forcible document." Mr. McCreary: "Able and appropri ate." Dolliver of Iowa: "Wanting in defi niteneas and makeß no pretence to leadership of public opinion." Mr. Wilson: "The measage is all right." Tracey of New York : "I am heartily in accord witn it." - _ Gear of Iowa: "The preeident given away the ways and means committee on income tax, will restore Liliuokolani, and agrees with Hancock that tariff ia a local issue." Bynum of Indiana: "Aclear and con cise statement." Mr. Boutelle: "The first executive document which charges a United States minister with malfeasance and treason." Payne of New York: "A remarkably disappointing document." Dingley of Mayne: "Voluminous and wearisome." Dalzell of Pennsylvania: "The por tion on the tariff' shows that tacts weigh nothing with tariff retormers." Hepburn of Iowa: "The discussion of the Hawaiian policy is disappointing." Voorhees of Indiana: "It is in the main a Bound and strong document." Cannon oi Illinois: "The mesasge will not tend to restore confidence to the producing and commercial interests of the country." 

SENATORIAL OPINION. Senator cPherton : ''Excellent all the way through." Senator Murphy: "It is a good mes sage." Senator Palmer: "The president's impressions are wide of the mark le garding fraudulent pensions." Senator Kyle: "1 am pleased with the income tux portion, but not about Ha waii and the issuance of bonds." Senator Morrill: "Theindorsement of a tariff bill not yet acted upon in com mittee is unexpected and remarkable." Senator Hoar: "It treats important questions feebly and briefly. The ref erence to tbe tariff report iB a breach of privilege." Senator Murphy: "lam surprised learn that the restoration of Queen Lihuokaiam iB really contem plated." Senator Hawley: "It lacks vigor and .B a disappointment." Senator Dubois: "It is lacking in force, strength and Americanism." Senator Jones of Nevada: "There is Ino hnpe for aiiver while the present administration iB in power." Senator Piatt: "It scarcely deserves comment." Senator Shoup: "I am disappointed at the absence of any recommendation of the recognition of silver." Senator Dixon: "It ia wearisome, without BUggestiona aa to the immediate interests of the country." Manderaon of Nebraska: "With dogged obstinacy and mulish stubborn ness that persists in wrong doing when full enlightenment shows a wiser course, the adminiatration, having hauled down the flag in Hawaii, now proposes to trample it in the dust. We are to trade the goddess of liberty for a harlot."
