Fell jk allien! of tht Senile and Uoute of Rtpn- taLnitn: Another year of health, ami ol sum citDtly abundant harvests, has passed. Far tbesa, act! especial y for the improved condition cf out National affairs, our rtci itel arid pro found gratitude to God is due. We remain in ncaca ami fiiondship with fmeicu cower The iff xti of disloyal citisens of the United States, to involve ns in foreign war', to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have keen unavailing. ller Britannia Majesty s Government, as was justly expected, have tier-laid tbeir authority 10 ore vent the departure ot new hostile expo dittoes (rem British ports. The Emperor cf France has. ty a like prec eding;, promptly via dica'ei the neutrality which be proclaimed at the beginning cf tire c ntcst. Qiesrionsof great intricacy and importance have allien out ot the I lockade, ana otbei Del ligerent operations betwoen the Government and several of the uiaritime powers ; bat ttey have been diecofsed, ana as tares was po-stbie. . accommodated In a sp lit of frankte s, justice and mutual Rood will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality ot their a'!i initiations, have commanded the mj.ci and confidence of maritime poweis. The supplemental treaty between the United State and Great Britain for the tupprereion of tbe African Slave liaie, made on the 17th day of Ki brnary last, has been duly ratifiarl aid carried into execution. It is believed that, ir far a Atntricsn tort and American citrates are concerned, that inhuman and odious traffic hat been brought to an end. I shall submit, for the eons deration of the Senate, a convention for the adjurtruent of poe- aeSoiuQ claims in Washington territory, ana tng outof tbe treaty of the loth of June, 1846, between tho United Slates and Great loltain. and which t avehieu tbe sluice of eorne disquiet among the uttz ns ot that now rapidly Im- provug p.-'.not tue country. A uovel and impoitant qicstirm involving tbe extcntol tbe marliluie jutisJlctlon of Spain on the waters which surround the Ielanl of Cuba, has been debated without reaching tin agree. en t. and it is proposed in an ami. able pint to retur it to the arbitrament of a fneody power. A ciLventLn for that purpose win ue suuniittra to tne seuate. 1 have thought it proper, sulject to the ap proval of tbe Senate, to toutur with the inter ested commercial power in an arrangement for the liqub aliuu of the Scheldt dues upon tbe principles watch h-ve teen l.eritoioie a-iop'.ed la retard to tbe imposts tpen navigation in lbs waters of Denmark. The long pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili, tcU'.hiog tbe ee sure at S iena, in Tern, by C'nilUa cthsers of a large amount in treasure belonging to citi Sao of toe Called State, has been brought to a dM by tne award of his HI -jany, the King of the B lKians. to whote arbitration the ques tion wasreteirtd by tbe paitlea. Thesulj ret was thoronsblv aud iratiently examined Dy tnat justly respected magibtrato, and although the awarded to tho claimants may not have been as largo as they expected, there is no reason to diauust tbe wisdom of bis lljesty's decMon. That decision was promptly com plied with by Chili when intelligence in regard it reached that country. Tbe joint commission, nnd r the a t of the last aeeslnn, tor carrying lutoeiijct tneconven Hon witb Peru on rfce subject of claim, has been orgaoisad at Lima, and is engaged in the busi ness Intrusted to it. Difficulties concerning tb Inter-ozeanic tren ait through Kreiraug, are in course of amicible adjustment. In confoiniity with the principle set forth in mv Lat annual mtSHaze. 1 bavo received a rep Tesentative from the United States of Columbia, and have accredited a minister to that Republic. Incidents occurring in tbe progress of our tvil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of iuteiuatiotal questions touching the rights of foreigners in this conn trv. and cf United States cit zens abroad, in regard to tome governments. These rights are at least partially deux a by treaties, lo no Instance, however, is it expressly stipu la ted that to tbe event cf civil war a foreigner residing in this eoontry within tbe lim of the Insurgents is to be exempted from tho rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the government ol his country canuut expect any privilege or immunities distinct from that character. 1 regret t say, how ever, that such claims have been pat forward and ia soma ins'ances in behalf of foreigners bo have lived in tbe United Stilus t egreaer part of their lives.

I aek your attec- tion to Ihe claim of tbe minister residing there for the d images he sustained in the destruction by tire, of the residence ot tbe Legation at Yeddo. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with tbe Emperor ot riusaia, wmcn it is neuevea wu mult in tffdetinir a continuous line of telegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast. I recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also a telegraph between tbe Capital and the National forts along the Atlantic seaboard and Uull ol Mexico, sucn communications, established with any reason able outlay, would le an economical as well an effective aid in the diplomatic, military and naval service. Tbe consular atetem of ihe United States, undar the enactment of the last Congress, be gins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely to with an increase of trtdu, which will ensue whenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad bave b:en faithfully dofending American lights. In protecting com mercial interests, our consuls bave neceesaiuy had to encounter iocrea-ed labors and respon sibilities growing outof the war. These they bave, for tbe moet part, met nd discharged with s al and efficiency. Tnig acknowledg ment justly include those consuls who, re siding in Morocco, Egypt, lurkey, Japan, China and other Oriental countiles, are charged with complex functions and extraoidma-y puw era. The condition of the several organ iaedTerri- tcries ia generally satisfactory, although Indian disturbances in (new Mexico bave not been en tirely auppnased. Tbe mineral resources oi Colorado, Nevada, Idahoe, Mew Mexico and Ada jo are proving far richer than has been beretob re nndeiatood. 1 lay Del. re yon I communication on this subject from the Gov etnor ot New llexlco. I lur iln submit to vour consideration the ex Dediencv of establishing a svstem tor tbe en touragement of Immigration. Altnuugh this source of national weillh and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for Several years before tbe insurrection occur. ed, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field ol industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, aa well ot iron and coal aa of tbe precious metals. While the demand for labor is thus increa cd be.e, tens of tbousm l ol persons destitute of remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign c insulates and offer ing to emigrate to the United Stat -a, if essen tial but very cheap assistance can be afforded them. It is easy to at that nnder the sharp discipline of civil war, the nation is be ginning a new life. His noble en jrt demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and aupport of tbe government. Injuries, uoforseeo by the government and unintended, may In some care bar been in dicted on the subjsctaorcitfa-'DSot foreign coun tries, both at sea and oo land, by persons in tbe setvice of the United States. Aa this Gov ernment expects r edits from other powers when similar Injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizjna of tbe United States, we moat be prepared to do Justice to foreigner. It tbe existing judicial tnoanais are inadequate to this purpute, a special court may be authorised witb power to near and de cide such claims of the character referred to aa may have arisen under treaties and the public law. Conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commissions, bave been proposed to some governments, but no definite answer to the proposition has yet been received from any. Iu the course of tne session I shall probably have occasion to r quest you to provide indem nification to claimants where decrees ot restitu tion bave been rendered and damages awarded by Admiralty Courts, and in other cases where this Government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle, and where tbe amount of that liability has been ascertained by an tutor mat arbitration. Tne proper officera of the Treasury have deemed tnemselves required by the law ot Ihe uuiwu oiaiee uuuu.iue euijact wuciuauu a vaa upon tbe incomes of foreign consols in this countrv. While inch a demand mav not.

I make this aog ges'ion upon the ground that a comity which ought to ba reciprocated exempts ourcjnsule in all other c.untriea from taxation, to tbe extent thua indicated, the United States, I think. oujbt not to be exceptionally illiberal to inter national trade and commerce. Tne operations of the Treasury durinz the last year bave been successfully deducted. The enactment by C.ngresaof a National Bank ing Law, baa proved a valuable aupport of the public crmtit: and the general legislation in re lation to loans has mlly answered the txpeo tations of its favorers. Some amendments may be reunited to perfect existing laws. But no change oa their principles or general scope la ueiitvea lo Le needed. Since these measures have been in operation. all demands on tbe Treasury, including the pay of Ihe army and. navy, have been promptly met and fully satisfied.

1S,UUI,WU The naval force of the United States conaiata. at this time, of 688 vessaia, completed and In tbe course of completion, and of these 76 are iron clad or armored atcamera. The events of the war gives an increased interest and import ance to tbe navy which will probably extend bevond the war Itself. The armored vessels in our Navy, comtleted and in service, or which are nnder contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in uumher those of any other power. But while these may be relied upon for harbor de feuce and coast service, o there of greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purpose and to maintain oar rightful position on tne ocean. The cbanas that has taken place In naval veseeis and naval warfare since tbe introduction of steam as a motive power for eblpa of war, demands either a cones pending change In some of our existing Navy Tarda, or the eatab- usnment oi new one ror tne o instruction and necessary repair of modern naval Teasel. No incousiderable embarrassment, delay and public niury bave teen experienced Iron, a want ol such governmental establishments. Tbe necessity of such a Navy Yard, so fnraishe I, at some suitable plax upon the Atlantic sea board, has, on repeated occasions, been brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, an 1 ia aaln presented In the report of the Secretary, which accompanies this communication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and de p it for naval purposes, rjpoo one of the western rireis. A naval force haa been .create! on those inte rior waters, and under many disadvantages, within little moie than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the coun try at the commencement of the present ad ministration. Satisfactory and important ai have been tbe pertormanoes of tbe beroio men of tbe navy at this interesting period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the auooesa of oar mechanics aad arttxins In the production of war vessels, which haa created a new form of naval power. Our country hi advantages superior to any other nation In our resources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities ot fuel in the immediate v eto ttyotboth.and all available and in close proximity to navigable waters. Without tbe advantage of public woiks, the resource of the nation have been developed and its power diaplayed In tbe construction oi a navy oi an a mgni(aid. which has, at Ihe very perl'd of Its creation. rendered signal service to the union. Ihe Increase of tbe number of seamen In the public setvice, from 7.50J men in tbe spring of UC1, to about 31,000 at tbe present time, haa biea accomplished without apeclal leaUiatinn. or extraordinary bonntlea to promote that in crease. It haa been found, however, that the operation of the draft, with the high bounties paid tor army recruit, la beginning to affect injuriously tbe naval service, and wllL if not corrected, be likely to Impair Ita efficiency by aeiacning seamen irom ineu proper calling, and inuueing mem to enter ue army, i therefore respectfully suggest that Congress might aid com tne army ana navat service Dy a definite provision on tbia subject, which wonld at the same time be equitable to tbe communities more especially Interested. I commend to your consideration the antr- gestion of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to Ihe policy of fostering and training teamen, and also the education of officer! aad engineer for the naval eery ice. The Naval Academy Is rendering signal service la preparing midship men for the highly responsible dntiea which, in after life, they will ba required to perform. In order that the country abould not be deprived or tne proper quota ot eu.ccai.ea omcere, lor nicu legal provision naa seen mam at tbe oaval school, tbe vacancies caus-'d by the no lect or omission to make nomination from the Stiii la insurrection, have been filled by tbe Secretary of Ihe Navy. Tbe school ia now more mil and complete than at any former period, and in every ft-oect -.ititled to tbe favorable consideration of Coogi.-a. During tbe past nscal year the nnanclil con lltloa of th Pott Office Department has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am giatifled n haintr able to atate that tbe actual postal revenue haa nearly aquaUd the entire expendl- mraa. th latter amounting to aii,aia,zuo o ana tha former to $11.163.789 69. leavirg a U-ai-ijutt of bat $160,417 26.

The decrease la I860 in the actual amount of transportation has been onh alo it 25 per cent.. but Iba annual. expenditure on account of tbe same haa been reduced 35 per cent. It is m tLi feat, therefore, that the Post Office Department may become self-sustaining in a 'ew Je.rs, even wnb the restoration of the whole service. Tbe international conference of Postal Dele gates from the principal countries of Europe and America, which waa called at the suggestion ol the Postmaster General, met at. Pail on tbe 11th o!

The principles estab llsbed by the cnnferer.ee as best adapted to facilitate -postal Intercourse between nation. and aa the basis of future pcatal conventioi a, inaugurate a general system of uniform Inter national chaigea at reduced rates of postage. and cannot tail to produce b. nebcial results. 1 rel r you to tbe report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is berewitb laid before you. for useful and varied information in relation to tbe public lands, Indian affairs, patent, pen sions, and other mattera of public concern per taining to hia department. Ihe quantity of land dispoaed of dating tbe last and Srat quarter of tbe r re-en t fiscal year was 3.841 649 acres, of which 1C1.&11 acres were sold for cash. One million four hundred and fifty-six thousand five, hundred and fourteen actt a were taken up under the ilomeateai law. and the residue disposed cf under the lawsgrant- ing lands for military bounties, for railroidand other purposes It a'.so appsara that the sale ot tbe public lands la largely on the increase. it haa long been a cherished opinion of some of our wlcest atateemen that the people of tbe united statea had a bbiber acd more enduring Interest in the early" settlement ajd aubstantial cultivation of the public landa than in the amount of direct revenue t be derived mm the ale of them. This opinion hat had a con trolling influence in shaping legislation upon ine surjeci oi our national uoma'n. I may cite aa evidence of thia the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual settler tha grant to the States of the oveiflowed lands within their limit in oider to their beinsr re claimed and rendered fit for cultivation. The granta to rallwayc mpauitaof altemateeections of land upoa the contemplated linea of their roans, wnicn, wnen completed, wtii io lareelv multiply the facilities for reaching our distant pcasesaiotia. Ibis policy haa received re moat nigral and beneficial Illustration in the recent! enactment granting Homesteads lo actual a ttl .r. Since the firat day of January laat. the before mentioned quantity of l,ob,614 acre of laud have teen t ken op nnder ita provisions. This fact, and tho amount of tales, furnish gratify ing evidence of increasing etilercent npon tbe pnbuc lands, notwithstanding the great strut gle In wbich tbe energies ot tbe nation havt been engaged, and which baa reauired eo lame a withdrawal of our cltlxeca from their accus tomed purauita. I cordially concur la tbe recommendation of the Secretary of tbe Interior, austrt atioa a modi- noatioo of Ue act in favor of thuae engaged in the military and naval service of the United etatta. 1 doubt sot that pougreaa will cbeer folly adopt such meaeare ae will, without ea seutially changing tne general featurea of the ystem, secure, lo the greatest practical ex tent, iu benefit to thosu who have left their home la the defence of tbe country In thi ardu-xi e lais. I invite your attention to the views of the Secrctaiy aa to tbe propriety of raising, by ap propriate leg elation, a revenue Irom tue miu oral landa of the United State?. The meatnrea provided at vour last session for tbe removal cf certain Indian tribes have oeen carried into effect Sundry treatie have been negotiated, which will, in due time, be submitted fur the constitutional action of the senate.

The dt taila set forth iu tbe report of tae secretary evince the urgent need for imme diate legislative action. I commend the benevolent institutions, estab- Uhed or patronized by the Government, in tale uisirm, to year generous and loitering care. Tbe attention of Cong teas during the last session waa engaged to tome extent with a pro position for enlarging the water communication between tbe Mi&is:ippi river aud the North eastern Bjaboaid, which propositi, n, however, failed far the time. Since then, upoa a call of tbe greatest re spectability, a convention baa been held at Chicago cpon the tame subject, a summary of whoas viewa ia contained ia a memorial ad dressed to tbe President and Congress, and which I now have Ihe honor to lav before von. That thia interest ia one which, era long, will force Ita own way, I do not enteitain a doubt. While it auDmltt.'d entirelv to vour wk- dom aa to what can be d ne now, augmented interest la given to thia aubject by tbe actual commencement of work npon the Pacific Bail- road, under auspices ao favorable to raDid progresa and completion.

I transmit the Second Annual Ferwrt of the Commissioner ot tba Department of Agrlcul tore, asking your attention to the developments In that vital Inter eat of tba aatioo. When Coo grets assembled a tear aoro. the war had already lasted naariv twenty month. and there had been many conflict cn both lane and sea, with varying rcaulta. The rebellion oaa oeen prcesed back Into reduced limit, vei the tone of public feeling aad opinion at home and abroad was not satisfactory.

The preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued In September, waa running ita aasigned peiiodtotbe beginning of Ihe new year, mor.tb later tbe final Proclamation came, in cludirg the announcement that colored m-n of a auitabie condition would ba received into the war Bervice. Ihe policy of emancipation, and of employing black soldiers, gave to tbe future a new aspect, about wbich hope and fear and uoudi contended in uncertain eonnict. According to our political system, aa a mat ter of tivil adminiatraticn, tb General Gov ernment bad no lawful power to en ct emand nation in any Sta'e, and for a long time it had been hoped tnat tbe rebellion could be anp pressed without resorting to It aa a military me isure. It wa, all the while, deemed posi bla that the necessity for It might come, and. that if it should, the cilsia cf tbe contest would then be presented. it came. and. aa waa anticipated, waa follow ed by dark and doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another review, ihe rebel borders are pressed ill further, back by Ihe complete opening of th aiiAUiKippi ; tne country dominated by me re bellion la divided into distinct parts, with no practical le communication between them, len nea.ee aud Aikansaa have been substantially cleared of insu'geata control, aod ictlaentiil cm i-ns io each, owners of slaves and advocatea of Slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for Emancipation in their respec tive statea. Of those States not ir.c'nded in the Ernancl palion Proclamation, liirylmd and Miaacuri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint uporythe extension of slavery into new Territories, only dispute now as to the best mo le of removing it within their own limits. Of thcaa who were slave at the beginning of tue rebellion, lull i JU.ouo are now in the United States military aerv'ce, about one half of which number actually bear arms In the ranks thus giving the double advantage of takiug ao much labor from the insurgent causa, aal enpplying the places which must otherwise bo filled with ao many white men. So far aa Uattd it ia difficult to aiy that they are not aa good soldiers aa any. No servile in surrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, haa marked tbe meaeures of emancipation atd arming tbe black. Tness measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and, con temtairary with such discussion, tbe tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same measure have been fulTv discussed, supported, critic zed and denounced, and the annual election following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we bavs tbe new reckoning. Ihe crisis men threatened to divide the frlecds of tbe Union it past. Looking, now, to the preaont and fu'.ure.and with reference to a resumption of the national autboriry wlttin the Statea wherein that au thority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a Proclamation, a copy of wbich is herewith transmitted. On examination of thia Proclamation it will appear, aa i believed, that ootbing 1 attempted beyond what ia amolv iiuuaea uy uao tyooeuiuiion.

But why tender the benefits of tbia pro vision only to a State Government set no in this particular wayf lbta aectlon of tbe Constitution content nlatea a case wdviciu we element wiium a state IA- vorable to republican Government, in tbe Union, may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to, or oven within the State, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing. Au attempt to guarantee aud protect a re vlved State Government, in whole or in a Pre ponderate part, from tho very element against boss hi etuitl. a and violence it is to be pro tected, is simply absurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements,so as to build only from the sound, and that test is a sufficiently lib ral one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of hia former ncaoundneaa. But if it ba proper to require aa a teat of ad mission to the political body an oath of alleai- ance to the Constitution of the United Sratee and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery f Those lawa aad proclamations we.e enacted and put forth for tbe purpose of aiding io the suppression of tha rebellion. To give them tbeir lullest enact there bad to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my judgment, they bave aided, and will further aid, the causa lor which they were Intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, bat would also be a ctu.l and an astounding breach of faith. 1 mav add. at tbia color, tnat while i remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclama tion, nor shall I return to slavery any person who la free by tha terms of that Proclamation. or by any of tha acts of Congress. For these ana other reasons it la thought best that support of these measure shall be in eluded in tbe oath, and it is believed tbe Ex ecutive may lawfully claim it In return for pardon and reatoration of forfeited righta, which he baa clear sonstituiionat power to withhold altogether or grant npon tbe terms which be shall detm wisest for the public interest. It should be observed also that thia part of the oath is tubjaoa to the modifying and abro gating poster oi legislation and supreme judicial decision. Ihe procosed acquiescence of the National executive In any reasonable temporary Stale arrangement for tbe freed peopla, is made with the view of poeaibly modifying the confusion nl destitution which muat at beet attend til c'a-aea by a total revolution of labor throughout tbe whole States. It Is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people In three States may be somewhat more ready to give up tha causa of their affliction, f to thia extent this vital matter be left to themselves, white bo power ot tha National Executive to prevent an abuse ia abridged by tha riropoaiikia. Th sngpattoti la tht Fmbjita fl f lhfr rixt-re. sl-ay. on of fuI..ished a, ,hort nmirr. maintaining the political framework of the State, or what ia called reconstruction, la made in the hope that it may do good without danger or harm. It will save labor, and avoid great confusion. But why any Proclamation now upon th's subject f This question is beset with the conflicting view that the a'ep might be delayed too long or be taken tco on. In some Stat: a tbe elements f ,r resumption seem ready for action, hnt remain inactive, ap parently for the want of a rallying point or plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B, rather than B that of A; an I if A and B shou'd agree, how can they know bet that the General Government here will rrj ret their plan. By the Proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them aa a rallying point, and which they are aiwured in advance will not be rejected here. Tuis may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The objections to a premature presentation of a plan by tbe National Executive, consist in the danger ol communis oo points wnicn coma be more safely left to further developments. Care haa been taken to ao shape toe docu ment aa to avoi i embarrassments from thtj sonrce. Saying that, on certain terms, reitaia classes will be pardoned, with rigbta restored, it is not said that other classes or other terms will never be included. BsjU.g that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specific way, it is tot said it will never be accepted in any other way. Ihe movement by State action, for emaoci- patlon in aeveiai ol the Statea cot ii.ciu.ltd in tbe Emancipation Proclamation, are mattera of profound gratulation. And while I do not leoe.tin detail what 1 have heretofore ao earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views aud feeling remain unchanged, and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important step to a great consummation. Iu tha midst of other cues, however im portant, we must not luaetight of the fact that tbe war power ia (till our main reliance; to that power alone can we look yet for a time to give confidence to the psple i l tha cmtested legions, that tbe resurgent power will not again overrun tbem. until that confidence shall be established, little can be done any a here f-r wh.tis called re construction. Hence our chief at care must still be directed to the army and navy, who have thus far bores their harder part ao nobly and well. And it may be esteemed tortuoato that in giving the greatest efficiency to theee indispen sable arms, we ilo ilsu honorably recou aa the gallant men, tiom commander to sentinel, who composed toem, aad to whom, 'mure than to others, Ibe world must stand indet.tr d for the borne of tnedom disenthralled, n generated. enia-ged and perp;ta.te-i.
