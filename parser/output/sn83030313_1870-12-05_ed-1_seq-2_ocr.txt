At Hie lu-t sohsi?u tlie "PauiUiuler," J. 0. Fremont, was At the Ueud of ilun concern, an<l it failed In ttie lie iBO, tuoutflt it passed the .senate. Fremont Is L&t bv ktiy means a? oopulor with the republicans ai uiati.v person* uuppo.se him to i>c. He vras vigor ously opposed by Senator Howard, ?l Miclilsran, and a number or other radical Senators and members, it sward, who is chairman of the Sen ate Commit fee on the Pacific Railroad, is in favor or i ie Transcentinental or some ether southern i-acitic railrouu per ,^e, but ho does not think Fremout has ttie business capacity to lead so imponaiit aa en terprise. l>Oiitle-s m l >;>t?

During tho recess Mar, hall o. iu>berts, of New Yvirk, has been plucud ai the head of tlie enterprise, and, lu conjunction w th such men as Col. oteDbius uud John Jacob Astor, it is said that Koberu pro poses to push ihe lull thri'UKlt dunua the comnis session, as i he hill now sionns, the company ask very little from the lederal government in the way of public luuds. Indeed, the government has little to give that would be of value te this rsad on the route proposed. Their subsidy, il thoy receive uuy, will have to come irom the Sia'e or 'l?xas, where, I i am informed, the geiieial Kevernmeni has uo f public lands, nil of them having in some way Tallen under the control of (he State. To be sure, there must be a grant of lands from the general government m the Territory of New Mexico and tho Indian Territory, but it will l?e comparatively smail; tne main route lies throu?ii Te.vus. The opposition in Congress to tue road is likely to c.otnn from two sources: lirst, the members and their rrieuds who are interested In the success of tiic Pacific railroads already tmilt and hi operation; and sccoiui. from the friends ol' Fremont, who think he has not been well treated by Uoberis, stebbins and other capitalists whs hud taken hald of the pro ject. it Is said that recently all the parties con cerned, inciuding Fremont, had irate raised and come to an understanding. 01 tldt, himeii r. 1 am not sure. I only know that the friends of Fremont are not satisfied, whatever lie may be. bkv unrLKi; s t.irfLK JOU. Among ttie schemes for annexation is Btn Bui ler'a proposition to gjt liold of Prince Edward Island for the puryo.ie of annexing It t? Se<\ Eng land. One fit the oiils now ou the Speaker's taolo, "to promote trade wltu ITlnce Edward Island," was lntrodiicod t>v Butler at the la.st session as an entering W( <lge for the scheme which, it is said, ho will endeavor to carry our. during the coming session. Ho made an elaborate argument before tho Committee of Ways and Means in favor of Ills "trade" bill, and tinally succceded in getting his frend Saiu Hooper, of Massachusetts, to report it to the House. It is said that Butler broached the subject or annexing 1'rmce Edward . Island to the President when he was here a few weeks ago, and that he met. with some encour agement. His argument is tUat the people of tho Island want to join the Huion. and that it would be advantageous for both them and us to como together. If liutlcr undertakes It ho will be likely to get Prince Edward Island, as he seldom tails in anything he inters into wan energy. I TUK 

POSTAL TKLKliRAPD. General Washburn, of Wiscousiu, Intends to de vote tlie last, session of lus Congressiouui career to advocating tlie passage of bid tolearapli bill, lie expects to nave a stubborn tight with the ue-torn Union Telegraph mouopuly, as he had lust session; but lie thinks t lie business luii/ be managed In such a way as to row pel tlie Western Lnion Company to sell to the government at a reasonably price, or el*e to Dank it nu<t leovoit practically wnhont business. Mr. William Orion, the presi dent or the Western Union company, watt Here not ionjr ago, and .coined to think that Washburn had | 110 show of success. In is only a question 01 time, however, and even If Mr. Wasnburu fails the reform Which be has.cbttmpionod will be taken up by other*. i'HK APl BorHIATION BILLS. , It ihvi intontlon of Air. Dawes, tlie chairman of Uio Committee on Appropriations, to being in the appropi lutiou bills early in l?e session, and to bavc thrill made special orders, so that th -y mav be oou- , aid ared and passed at once. To this end he has bad , all the estimates prepare I in advance or tlie meet ing of Congress, and" no time win be lost m getting ills committee r,o worlt on t hem. TUK ST. DOMINGO PURCHASE. Hit is stated in official circles that the President will Bend to tlie Senate u new treaty fur the pmcbasc and annexation of St. Domingo. Should ue do so there will be u lively contest in the Seuate, the op position being led, as before, by Mr. Sumner. Tliat gentleman is understood to entertain precisely the t^ame views on thu subject ot the purchase of St. Domingo that he <lid last winter, if anything, he is more decided ami stubborn, as his personal relations wltli the Preside*!, have grown more unfriendly. TKLEOitAl'U 

CABI.K SCHEMES. There nre qolte a nurobor of these left over from the last session, but they are not likely to be considered at thU sea.-, leu for want of time. The largest scheme Is that of Cyrus Field, lo lay a cable from San Francisco to Japan and Chtnu, by wav of the 3auit. wicii Islands. The subsidy asked by Mr. Field is so large that there really never was mucn show lor his success. l ast winter Field had au Idea he could tonnage tiie thing with a few cheao dinner parties, lie declined to nave anything to do with the general lobby, confining bis operations in that direction to a few gentlemen who were all right on the score ol science and respectability, bur who had no know ledge of log rolling a measure through Congress. Field has another project on bond, to lay a cable be tween the United States and Cuba. This is conten ded to be an opposition Hue to the one of which General Baldy Smith is president. Smith fought it all last session, and it is said that it there is any prospect of Field's plan succeeding the Cuba Cable company will be on hand, willing to distribute something to the lobby. All the cable bills now before Congress, with tne exception of the one pro posed between this country and Belgium, ass sub. sidles, amounting all the way freia hall a million to live or ten millions of dollars. 

STEAMSHIP BILLS. Tbe question of Increasing our mercantile marine will come up In various forms. All the old pr jocis of last winter are likely to be revived, with wnat ?access remains to bo seen. Should the President recommend in lus Message the Imputation of foreign ships free or duty, as it is rumored Be will, this may give au entirely different turn to matters of this sort. Lynch'* bltl to revive American shipping is oil the Speaker's tabl9, and will undoubtedly ue brought up. Hut tbe whole programme with regard to these measures depends to a groat degree npon the recommendation of the President's Message. FAIM'ltr FOB 

WANT OP Ti BE. It is very easy to discover from a corsnry plane* at the bills now on the tables of tne two houses and tbe schemes likely to be proposed uiat much 01 ihti i contemplated legislation will tail for want of time.

Itoceiit Newspaper Attacks IJpon the Admiral. Malicious Efforts to Creato "Onpleasant* ne?s" - Extract* from Porter's Privato Journal- Interesting Rominisconafi. Washington, Dec. 3, 1870. The letter published In the World, and Sun of yes terday. purporting 'o ftuve been written In January, i860, by Admiral I'orter, to Secretary Welles, tu which the Admiral la represented as making re marks disparaging to Geueral Grant, has been re published here, anu Is creating cons.deiable com ment. No one can fall to remember the persistent efforts of two New York papers to provoke some reply iroui Admiral I'orier to tlietr numerous attack-; on htm, lor what reason commenced be never could divine. It la known how tliuue papers have attempted to affect the confirmation by the Senate of an oftlcer whose great offence seems to have been that lie Una done his duty to his country for lorty years, fought ; through the whole period of tiie rebellion as many successful battles as any other ofllcer. and at tempted to reauscltato the nary from the low ?bb to which 11 had fallen at the close of the war. It is rather tate in the day to attempt to interrupt the good feeling existing between I'resioent Grant and Admiral I'orter? two men who so rred so long and harmoniously together. This Is evinced pv the following extracts from a very voluminous private Journal kept by Admiral Porter during the war, and never intended lor the public eyo during his life time, bm which he ha? now put Into my hands to show lils sentiments and opinions concerning men ami things while passing events were making his tory. I have r.ot found on any of the page* of tho Journal a singlo word that speaks of General Grant in other thau the kindest and must eatUttfiastio manner. The following are KSTK ACTS Kltokl A I'M 1 II A L PORTER'S .1 Ot'RN'AL: - Cairo, 111., Nov., 1502. ? * * It was after a hard day's work at my desk and going round among ihe vessels iittiug out, that I accented an invitation to supper witii Captain McAllister, ytiutierinaster United Htates Army, who was living 01 board un old steamer. Wertereen loyma ourselves amazingly when a Utile bustle was heard m the room, and Gear rul Grant was an nounced. This was an unexpected arrival, lor the General was supposed to be lu Corinth. 1 Had never before seen General Grant, and he was quite a differ ent person from what 1 expected. 1 Imd se n so mauy general-1 during the war, with large staffs loi lowuig tlieni about, that 1 naturally looked around for General Grant's staff. 1 could, however, sco nothing but my own officers with their well laced coaia. captain McAllister came to my end of the cabin witii a plain looking men dressca in a citizen's brown coat witii a velvet collar, and a pair of gm.v pantaloons. All Ins habiliments were covered wit li dust and looked as If they had travelled many a mile. Those clothes, seedy in the extreme, attorned tho outer man ol General Ulysses Grant. One aiways tonus rather an exaggcr ited idea of a hero and expects to see something beyond the ordinary run ol men, IT not in personal appearance at least is the trappings of lils rank, but. Geueral Grant was distinguished by neither of these, and stood before me o a that oc casion the plainest, most unassumtuir man 1 ever beheld. Grant an i Sherman had Is en two of my heroes ever since the.v operated together In Western Kentucky aud Tennessee, although I had no acquaint ance wiih either of them. I had eie?eiy scrutinized thei>* operaiioti since the breaking out of the war. 1 made up my mind that thore was more good fcmeralsfctp In 'hose two men than in any other t ? o had read of. Iu Grant I saw the hold-on bulldog courage that wul tell ui the long rim against the be.-.*: arranged ta.ties, provided numbers and all sro equal; aud in bheimaa I beheld Hut genius that led to such achievements during the rebellion. When introduced Graut took me quleth by th? hand, its ir I were an olu acquaintance, witn "How are you, Admiral?" McAllister gave us .i small table apart trrmi the re't of the compaur. We sat down to talk wuii a wild duck aud aboi tie or cham pagne betore us, neither of which Grant touched. While I was looking earnestly at Grant, trying to nu'ke out hov, much of the man there was under that ilalu exterior, tit'- General was regarding i?" ; to see what amount of work there was under a" ih.i ; gilt buttons and gold lace with which the IVavv i)e- I partmant had bedizened my coat. The Geiu.al came at ones to Hie point? ??Admiral." said h \ "what Is all this you've been ' wrltUg mef" I tout him of my Interview with the President end j of the laiter!s lnteni luu with regard 10 McClernand. OraDt looked serious for a moment only. "When j can you move wi n your fleet t" lie asKed. ??To- ; 1110 n ow, or wheuever you wish to start," i replied. | "Then," said lie, "I will iff", oif at once. Sherman i will meet you at Memphis on the iwth (December) j wlili a i.oo!) men, all embarked on board <>r trau- i sports. 1 will leave Holly Springs about tlio mh. and march on Urauida with all my force? about. j 6u, oOO men.

I will oe in with lae : rtbels if they fall back on Vicksbiirg;" I told the uenerai thai 1 nould do up to time, md this was all that wan ever -aid on the subject. I Grant remained only a half hour longer, and i hen bade us trood uighi, sa, in?, "1 will st ait back to my headquarter* at on e.'1 * * * It is not niy purpose to write a history of General Grant s military career. Tnat will be done by abler pens than mine: but I intend to uoilce the personal character of a maa who lias achieved, perhaps, mure in a military way than any other liv ing general. * * * A ie?v days after my interview wlilt 0 ra at 1 met General Sherman, and I wrote to ise Secretary of the Navy ai follows: ?

Mr. Welles has more than once called my attention to tins remark. * * * Speaking of Sherman ? ? * Then ho turned to one of hi* quartermasters. and they sat dov. a to itus:ni3-s. Hero I found a d liferent kind of a mail lrom Grant ? :i hard, weather-beaten soldier, with naturally a cor united face, a nervous, raw less, active man, wit:i an the equipments ut a noldier on Ulm, and every inch a general. Ye; that plea sant, genial look that i?e!?uged to Grant's face was wanting in S;i(;nnau. I w?s not, I must oontess, much impressed with General Snerman on my first Interview, nltnough unfavorable impression-* worn off assoiin an the quartermaster went away and he i could attend to mo. He turned towards rne in Lite > mast pleasant way. poked the are ua>i taUed to me I us It he had Known in-* all his iuc. Sherman, unlike Grant, was* very talko live. He toM mo all tie had done, what he was doing, and what he intended todo, jumping up every three minutes to sand a message to some oue. 1 saw that Sherman differed lrom Grant in oue respect. Shermau attended to all do i tails himself, while Grant leir thorn to others, always selecting good men to perform the work. Sherman's eye was also the reverse of Grant's. It was i?lack, piercing and restle*i?, and appeared in strong contras' with his sandy complexion, h.ur and' beard. Grant's eyn was calm and ceid, tt'iiio!:gn when he waa angry it would light up with a fleice ness not pleas ant to encounter. I don't suppose there ever was a, greater coal ran', be1 r.'eun any two nteu man that between Gra?e anu Sherman. fuoy were unlike in everything excep; in their skill as soldiers. yet they agreed perfectly. I often rtiild in tneoarly pan ol :he rebellion ihat these ; wo generals combined had all the military ability that any one man ought to possess to mak? him a perfect general, ana 1 (sincerely believe that an army of 50,0U,< men under Sherman, with Grant a< Geueral-lu-Chlet. could da ?troy any army in the world o! va-uiv superior num bers?Sherman. with his genius lo direct the imme diate movements of the troops, arid dram, with hii ludoriutable courage that knows no uuch worn as yield.

These latter made no seizures, although at work over thirty days beiore the military were called out; and i point to this fact in justification of my statement to Washington, at the tune of the dismissal of my ten men, that there were no illicit stills then in operation.
