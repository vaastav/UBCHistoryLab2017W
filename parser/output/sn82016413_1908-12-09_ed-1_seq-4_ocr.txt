And the President Is a very busy man. Tho reports of heads of Depart ments were Issued on time. In the hands of tho printers months bcfoio they wero presented to Congress and made public. The U u 1 1 0 1 1 u Is entirely safe In the nssertlon that tho history of this Territory has been regularly punctuated with exeftses from heads of departments for not having their reports out on time for presentation to the Legislature. And when the newspapers havo tried to secure an udvanco copy of the messago of our Governor to the Territorial Legislature, that Impor tunt state document has been guard' ed with moro tender care than the Message of tbo President of the Unit ed States. Ilousevelt has considered himself entirely safe in sending out udvanco copies of his message to be held In confidence till formally presented. Koosovelt not only felt that his mes sage was safe as a confidential mat ter in the hands of mainland news papers, but also allowed It to be sent to the Associated Press papers of tho city of Honolulu. Strange to Territorial officers, but true. Tho present Territorial Adminis tration has not yet had the opportu nity to show whether It Intends to bo so narrow and pcanutty as Its predecessors In handling "state pa pers."
