The roll was then called by States, and one hundred and ninety-five members answered to their names. Alt the South Carolina members answered, ex cept, Mr. Miles, who is said to "be on his way.

Members then selected their seats by lot ; after which, without transacting any other busi ness, the House adjourned. THE 

IMMEDIATE QUESTION. It may now be regarded as certain, that the responsibility of dealing with open rebellion on the part of at least one of the States of this Union, is not to be reserved for Mr. Lincoln's administration. South Carolina will, beyond doubt, precipitate that responsibility upon Mr. Buchanan's administration, more than two months prior to tho expiration of his term of office. The great question, therefore, which now im mediately challenges the solicitude of every American citizen, is not, " What will Mr. Lin coln do?" but, "What will Mr. Buchanan dot" In less than three weeks from this time, South Carolina will have solemnly declared herself out of the Union, and have assumed the position, towards the United States, of an in dependent foreign Government. Unless she is to assume a position inconceivably ridiculous, she must resist all Federal interference with Vessels entering or departing from her harbors, and take possession (or attempt to do so) of aU United States military posts within her juris diction. While assuming to be an independ ent, foreign 'Power, she will make herself the laughing stock 'of the civilized world, if she permits, without forcible opposition, the United States authorities to collect duties from vessels entering Charleston -harbor, or United States troops to hold possession of Fort Moultrie. No one will do her the injustice to imagine that she could put herself in this ridiculous position before) the world. Iu the face of this moral certainty that South Carolina will, in less than threa weeks, openly resist the collection of the Federal revenues from vessels,, entering the port of Charleston, and attempt to take forcible possession of Fort Moultrie, what preparation is the Administra tion .making to meet toe emergency? Have any troops been ordered to Fort Moultrie o defend it against the threatened attack, or has a single naval vessel been ordered to the port of Charleston, to aid in the enforcement of the revenue laws'? Does Mr. Buchanan intend to permit South Carolina to seize the Fort without an effort to defend it ? Will he permit her to nullify the? revenue laws, without an effort to enforce them ? These momentous questions are now pressing themselves immediately upon the consideration of the country, and yet bow many ignore them, and eagerly iuquire, " what will Mr. Lincpln do ? " We are of the opinion, that what it will be Mr. Liucoln's duty to do, will depend very much upon what Mr. Bu chanan may do, during' the three months which are to intervene before Mr. Lincoln will have pOwer to do anything. The responsibility of meeting the crisis must be assumed by the present Administration, and the question, how h will be met, is the question of -absorbing in terest at this moment It is no less i question, than whether the present Administration will concede the right of a State to go out of the Union, and nullify .'all Federal laws, and take possession Of all- Federal property within her jurisdiction, at pleasure. Mr. Buchanan'sannual message, which we presume will be delivered to Congress before this paper goes to press, may throw some light upon this question, and we await its appear ance with intense solicitude. NOT FOR 

SALE. The National Intelligencer of this morning, in answer to a correspondent who refers to a rumor that " Mr. Corwin, of Ohio, is negotia ting for the purchase of that venerablo journal, with the jntention, of converting it inq the organ tyrr Lincoln," emphatically denies that there is any foundation in fact for such rumor, and says : " We may as well add, that the National Intelligencer Will never pass from the control of its present proprietors into any other hands while life and health last unless, indeed, shar ing in the common ruin in which unhappily' political events now threaten to involve all the interests of this great pquntry, the Intelligence snail sink yrrtu the reat, and,,lts property pass through the $ands of Jhe sheriff's officers. , That day, we trust, is far distant." The Washington correspondent of the Trib une, stating that the South Carolina Senators vfould Pot talto their seats in Congress, afthejr members,, who seemed, to greet cacti the umt cordiality and' good fee hire heretofore- witnessed on simllai resignation was unqualified, adds, as convinc ing evidence of the truth of the statement, that Mr. Hammond had sent to this city for the accumulated salary dne him. We should like to know the date tfr wbifch the 'honorable Sen ator demand! paymctii. -It strikes us as an other Instance of that inconsistency for which our South'" Carolina friends have always been noted ; and we would commend to him and to others who fulminate against a Union from which they receive benefit, the rebuke of Baillie Nicol Jarvie, administered to one of his friends upon a similar occasion. "Sawney," said the Baillie, " while ye cat the bread and wear the claes of a mon, never belittle yonrsel' by call ing him names. It's ni honest" nor christian?' - Gov. Winslow, of North Carolina, who arrived in this city on Saturday, in the three o'clock train from the South, states that he was the only through passenger on the train. He says ha asked the conductor on the train what was the meauing of this. The conductor informed him that there had been very little travel for some weeks from the South, and it was diminishing every day, owing to political troubles. Thomas Dinsmore, bne the Old Defenders of Baltimore in 1814, was buried in that city on Saturday. The deceased was In the eigthty third year of his age, a native of Ireland, but resident of Baltimore since his nineteenth year. The thirtieth anniversary of the struggle for Polish independence was celebrated Saturday evening at the Cooper Institute, New York. Addresses were delivered and resolutions passed for the formation of a Polish national society. The meeting was well attended, and the pro ceedings enthusiastic.

Alfred Rust, member of Con gress from Arkansas. I believe, first, that from the adoption of the Federal Constitution to the present moment, the Southern people have never had less cause to complain of our Government and threaten its overthrow than they now have. If the most experienced and enlightened statesmen of other countries could witness the universal pros perity enjoyed by the people of our own, and at the same time the fear, it not the conviction, which is almost as universal that the Govern ment to which we owe so much of it is on the brink of disruption, they would be driven to the conclusion that a- general lunacy had seized upon the minds of the American people. I recognise the election of Mr. Lincoln, by less, perhaps, than one-third of the votes of the United States, aided by the intrigues of the Southern disunionists, as no justification for a thought of revolution. Elected under the forms of the Constitution, those who would resist or defeat by force his inauguration would commit the highest crime known to onr laws. No one who has read the debates upon the Constitution and the cotemporary political his tory of our country will maintain, I presume, the constitutional right of a State to secede from the Union. Such a pretension is, in my opinion, an insult to the memories of the wise and patriotic sages who framed the Constitu tion. Our first remedy, under a Federal ag gression, as in the case of the Missouri Com promise, which was pronounced by the Su preme Court of the United States as a nullity, is an appeal to this same court. This failing us, our only resort is revolution. To do this, whenever an aggression is attempted by the Federal Government, I am ready to commit myself. Whatever moral influence I may be able to exert will be in favor of the inauguration of the elected President, and the enforcement of the constitutional laws of the United States after his election. In conclusion, I will say that all I am, and have, and hope for, are identified with my adopted State, and I am ready to involve them in her destinies. I believe that if the opinions and wishes of nine tenths of the people of Arkansas are re flected by her representatives at Little Rock and in Washington, her course in the present political crisis will be temperate and conserva tive. If I should be mistaken, and, in opposi tion to my humble but honest and earnest counsels and remonstrances, her action, through ber constituted authorities, carrvinz out the will of her people, should be different, I will yield to it a mournful acquiescence. Respectfully, your obedient servant, A. Rubt. The Brio Minnie Scuiffer. Boston, Nov. 30.

ANOTHER MEETING AT CHARLESTON. On Friday night, another great secession meeting was held in Charleston, when Mr. Me minger, the commissioner sent to Virginia last winter, made a speech. lie counselled coolness above all things, and said, if an unau thorized attempt were made to take Fort Moul trie, tho garrison were in honor bound to de fend it j but when Carolina, as a retiring part tier of the Union firm, formally claimed the forts as her share of assets, then, if not grant ed, let the Governor say to the young men of Charleston, "Toke those forts" fwild ap plause and he doubted not in twenty-four hOurs they would to in possession of the right ful owners. Those forts were ceded to the Government by the State, to protect citizens of the State. To turn their guns against the peo ple of one of those States, when acting under authority of their State, would be treason. He said he was opposed to undignified haste in se cession, but supposed that about three days after the Convention met, secession would be consummated. All that he conceived was ne cessary for this end was to repeal the ordi nance by which the State consented to be a member of the Union. MESSAOE Or THE GOVERNOR Or MISSISSIPPI CALL Or A CONVENTION. Governor Pettus, in his message to the Legis lature of Mississippi, after enumerating in a forcibly striking and graphic style the wrongs of the South, and urging at some length the right of peaceable secession, advises the ap pointment of commissioners by the Legisla ture of bis State, whose duty it shall be to con sult with the other slave States, not as regards what is best to be done, but to inform them what she intends to do. It is tantamount, in other words, to the recommendation given by Gov. Moore, of Alabama, to his State, to secede, and afterward co-operate. Immediately after the message was received, a bill was reported and passed unanimously by both Houses, for the call of a State Conven tion. The election of delegates will take place, according to the provisions of the bill, on the 17th day of December, and the Convention is called for the 7th of January. The times thus specified correspond very closely with the dates already designed by Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, for similar purposes. A proposition has been introduced for the pas sage of a stay law, HON. JAMES GUTimiE. At a late Union meeting in Louisville, the Hon. James Guthrie, ex-Secretary of the 1 reas nry, appeared upon the stand, and took a seat beside tho chairman, and being loudly called far, made a speech, from which wo extract the following : " Should the election of a sectional President stultify the progress of a country like ours, a country whose progress is without a parallel in history? With the election of a single man, what have we to fear ? A voice, " everything." I say we have a great deal to fear if we fail to do our duty. But we have nothing to fear if we are true to ourselves and to our country, if we are actuated by the same sentiments that filled the breasts of our revolutionary sires. " We have a strong minority of friends in the free States an array of sympathizers and al lies, who have gallantly fought our battles, and now stand in the breach with us. While we denounce the aggressions of the North, is the South nothing to blame ? Are our skirts free from the causes of this impending calamity ? Has the South presented an unbroken front wun ner nonnern allies to the enimies? Have wo allow d tho conservative people to rally to the support of a conservative man ? We have much to fear if divided, but nothing to dread if we nre united. Here, on the south side of the Ohio, a middle State, with the free States on the one side and the South upon the other, what have we to gain out of the Union? and shall we be driven or forced into antagonism with either section? We naturally takes sides with those whose interests are identical with our own, but we will not fight the battles of South Carolina while she is safe at home in bed 1 Cheers." 

SENATOR MASON'S VIEWS. The Hon. J, M. Mason, of Virginia, has pub lished a letter, from which the following is. an extract! .. " Our honored State has ever maintained that our Federal system was a confederation of sovereign Powers, not a consolidation of States into one peopleand, as a consequence, when ever n State considered the compact broken, and in a manner io-endatigerrher 'safety, "such State stood remitted,'1 as.ln sovereign right, to determine forlherselt) and under no responsi bility, save to the opinion, of the civilized world, both tho mode"aiid measure of redress." THE PLAN or BRECKINRIDOe's HOME ORGAN FOR SAVINS THE CKION, The home organ of Mr. Breckinridge the Lexineton (Kv.)

In the opinion of the Statesman, "the only hope of the Union rests In the speedy convo cation of authorized delegates from the fifteen slaveholding States in joint conference," and " without its agency, the fate of the Union is as inevitably sealed in dissolution, as that the 4th of March rolls round." LETTER FROM GOV. HAMMOND SOUTH CAROLINA WILL CERTAINLT SECEDE. lladclijfe, Nov. 21. Gentlemen i I have just received your dispatch. It is impossible tor me to comply with your flattering request. South Carolina will certainly secede from the Union on the 17th or 18th of December next She intends to try it fully at all costs. No more compromise of any sort. She will take no guaranties, but will go out high and dry forever. If Georgia will back her, there will be little or no trouble. I only wish she hud called her Convention for the day before, and gone out first. We don't want to lead. We will gladly give Georgia the lead and all the honors. Let her put forth her hand and grasp them. She is, and must be, the Empire State of the South, and South Carolina will have, perhaps, a hard time without her sustaining arm. Your obedient servant, J. U. Hammond. Committee of Mass Meeting, Columbus. THE SOUTHERN TRADE. The following circular, signed by a large number of the merchants of Columbus, Georgia, has been sent to their customers throughout the country : "The undersigned, merchants of Columbus, amid the discord and confusion that are dis tracting the public mind, politically and com mercially, beg leave to cypress our adherence to those principles which alone can sustain us under the shock. Hence we are utterly opposed to anything like stay-laws, or any measures hav ing for their object any release from, or abate ment of, our obligations as debtors at home or abroad. Such a step would destroy all credit abroad, and annul all confidence at home. We must have good laws, and as sound a currency as our neighbors, and we will trust to a com. mon sjmpathy for all else we need." THE KANSAS TROUBLES. Warsaw, Mo., Nov. 30. A meeting of the people of Benton county was held yesterday at the court-house. A committee was formed for enrolling a lunteer company, Eighty-five members were reported. The following resolu tions were adopted t Resolved, That we, in common with the peo ple of the border counties, hail -with feelings of the greatest satisfaction the prompt and ener getic action of Governor Stewart in sending troops to'defend 'the homes and firesides of the border squatters, at a time when we were wholly unable to do so ourselves, for want of arms and munitions. Resolved, That we regard it the duty of every law-abiding citizen' who feels a proper respect for the supremacy of the laws and regard for Individual rights, not only to hold himself in readiness to turn at a moment's warning, but give all the aid and assistance to the troops now in the field for our protection. Resolvedj That when the country is threat ened, as this is, by a band of bloodthirsty vil lains, who boldly proclaim their intention not only to forcibly and illegally take onr property, bnt who actually hang up, in broad daylight, in view of their distracted add helpless families, for'no offence under heaven, our very best citi zens, and with newly furnished arms from Northern factories, shipped clandestinely to Kansas, roam over the country, breaking up all the peaceful relations of whole settlements, burn ing out Government officers and sheriffs, and chasing away all law abiding citizens, that we feel proud of the course of our Governor, and also proud to claim the citizen soldiery of St, Louis, Boonville, and Jefferson, and other mili tary organizations of our State, as the bulwark of our safety in time of need. Resolved, That we are glad that Mr. Bu chanan has at last seemed to arrive at a proper sense of his duty by dispatching Gen. Harney to Southern Kansas, with instructions to take Montgomery, dead or alive. THE TIKE'S PEAK EXPRESS. Fort Kearney, Dee. 1. The express from Denver, 27th, passed yesterday, with six pas sengers, and $4,000 in gold dust Capt Anderson, witkihis company of dra goons, returned, without being able to hold an interview with the Indians, to quiet tho appre hensions of settlers, express riders, and mail agents, along the Platte, at the hostile attitude the Indians have assumed. The commanding ollicer here has ordered Captain Steele, with his company of second infantry, to leave to-morrow for Cotton Wood Springs, where, it is reported, whole bands of Arapahoes, Cheyennes, and Sioux, are encamp ed, to the number of ten or fifteen thousand. Emboldened by numbers, they annoy travel lers, and commit both grand and petty larce nies. It is greatly feared that a general war will break out. THE CANADA FUGITIVE SLAVE MURDER CASE. Toronto. C. W., Dec, 1. The decision in the extradition case of the fugitive slave and murderer, Jones, has been still further post poned for a few days.

MYSTERIOUS MILITART, ORGANIZATION AT NORFOLK. Norfolk, Dee. 1. A )iaper is being mysteri ously circulated here fo- some days lor signa tures. From the source 'here it is said to have originated, I have no .doubt that something serious is contemplated Those whose signa tures are canvassed are chiefly young men who are skilled in military Uctics, and known to be thoroughly Southern id feeling. I obtained a slight clue to the contait of this document! It is simply a pledge to be ready at moment's warning to start lor a riven point Richmond, as I understand ancj thero join a force of chosen men, who are tc tattle iu the front ranks in defenco of Southeri rights. It is supposed that a similar movemont is on foot in every part of the Slate. It is surmised that this picked force will visit Washington the day of the in auguration. This organization is distinct from the regular military organizations of the State. THJETY.S,IXTH OONGEESS, .Second Session. SENATE, The Senate assembled to-day at 12 M.
