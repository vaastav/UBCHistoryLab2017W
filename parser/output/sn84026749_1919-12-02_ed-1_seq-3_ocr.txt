PRESIDENT FAVORS Message to Congress Advo cates Stricter Laws to Restrain -Reds.'? r?* (Continued from Flrat Pa?*.) menta ehe had to make to foreign ?_-f._ntr.ee on American ?eountiea held abroad, the ext-ndituree of American travelers abroad, and th* ocean freight charge? ah* had to pay to others about balanced the value of her pra-war favorable balance of trade. During tbe war America'? ex ports have been greatly stimulated, and Increased uricea have Increased their value. On the other hand, ehe haa purchaaed a large proportion of th* American securities previously held abroad, haa loaned aom? $8,000. 000.000 to foreign governments, and baa ballt her own ships. B a Lance at Trade laereaaed. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly increaaed and Eu rope haa been deprived of the means of meeting it heretofore existing. Eu rope can have only three way? of meeting the favorable balance of trade In peace times: by Imports Into this country of gold or of goods or by establishing new credits. Europe I? tn no position at tbe present time to ???;*. gold to u* nor could we contem plate large further importa of gold Into this country without concern. The time baa nearly passed for Inter national governmental loans and it 'wyi taita time to develop in this coun try a market for foreign securities. Anything, therefore, which would tend "to prevent foreign countries from aet tling for our exports by shipment? of ?good? Into thia country could only '.have the effect of preventing them ifrorn paying for our exporta, and th-refore of preventing the exporta from being made. The productivity of the country greatly stimulated by the war muat find an outlet by ex ports to foreign countrl*?. and any * mean-?? re? taken to prevent import? ?rill inevitably curtail export?, force curtailment of production, load the banking machinery of the country with credit? to carry unsold products and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want to ?ell, ' ?Te must be prepared to buy. What *v?r. therefore, may have been our ?/tew? during the period of growth of American busineas concerning tariff lea- ?tattoo, we must now adjust our own. economic life to a changed con ?f-tlon growing out of the fact that American buaineea Is full grown and ihat America is the greatest capital ist in the world. No policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities ?f America. The provincial stand ards and policies of the past, which ha?e held American busines? as If in a strait-Jacket, must yield and give way to the need? and exigencies of the new day In which we live, a day full of hop? and promise for Ameri can busine?.?. If we will but take ad vantage of the opportunities that are ou?? for tha asking. The recent war has ended our isolation and thrown upon us a great duty and responsi bility. The United States must _->are the expanding world merket. The United State, desires for itself only ??qual opportunity with th? other na tf-fl?)** of the world, and that through ??be procese of f.lendly co-operation ?pad fair competition the legitimate fSter.ata of th*? nations concerned ?saay be successfully and equitably ad jpa.ad.

I em sure It ia not necessary for me again to remind you that there I? one imnte vtiate and very practicable quest'on Resulting from the war which w* Should meet Ixif.* most liberal ?pint. ft is a matter of r-cognition and re lief to ?uf CAller.*?. I can do no better than? to quote from my laat me?aage urging this very action: **We must ee? to it that our retnrn lax aeldlers are assisted In every practicable way to find the places for ?jrhk-h they are fitted in the dally work Ot the . otft-Ty. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organ isation created by the Department of Labor for placing men seeking work; ?nd it can also be done. In st least one ?rery great field, by creating new op portunities for individual enterprise. The Secretary of the Interior haa pointed out the way by which return Ins: aoldlera may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto unde veloped regions of tbe country which the Federal i>_vernment has alresdy prepared 6r can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the e-atov<?r or neglected areas which lie within the limita of the older States: and I one? more take the liberty of recommending v?-ry urgently that his plana shall receiv.? the immediate and substantial support of the Congress." In th? m_*tt_cr ot tariff legislation.

The cloae rela- . tion between the manufacture of dye?- . stuffs, on the one hand, and of explo- '? aivea and poUonoua gasea, on the other, moreover, haa given the Indus try an exceptional significance and value. Although the United State? will gladly and unhesitatingly join In tbe program of International dis armament, it will, nevertheless, be a policy of obvioue pAdence to make certain of the aucceaaful maintenance of many atrong snd well ?quipped chemlesl plants. The Oerrnan chem ical Industry, with which we will be brought it-ito competition, was and may well he again, a thoroughly ??nit monopoly capable of exercising a com petition of a peculiarly insidious und dangerous kind." ' Farmer Ilea-erre-a Reeairn't'oa. During the war the farmer perform ed a vital and willing service to the nation. By materially increasing the production of hie land, he supplied America and the alli?e with the In creased amount of food ne? essary to keep their Immense ar.nie? in the field. He Indispensably helped to win the war. But there is now ?carcely lesa need of increasing the prod'jetion in food and the necesaar lea of life. I ask the Congreaa to conaider meant of encouraging el fort along theae linea Th*? import ance of doing everything possible; to promote production along j economical linea, to improve market-1 Ing, and to make rural life more at-1 tractive and healthful, la obvious. I would urge approval of the plane al ready propoaed to the rongreaa of the Secretary of Agriculture, to se cure the easentlal faeta required for the proper study of this question, through the proposed enlarged pro grams for farm management studies | and crop estimates. I would urge, also, the continuance of Federal par-] tklpation in the building of good roads, under the terma of existing law and under the direction of present agencies; the need of further action on the part of the State? and the Federal Government to preserve and develop our forest reaourcea. espec ially through the practice .of bettet forestry methoda on private holdinga and the extension of the publicly owned ?forests; better support for country schools and the more def inite direction of their couraea of study along lines related to rural problems; and fuller provlaion for sanitation in rural diatricta. and the building up of needed hoapital ana medical facilities in theae localities. Perhaps the way might be ci.?ared for many of these deairable reforms by a freah. comprehenalve survey made of rural conditions by a con ference composed of repreaentatlves of the farmer? and of the agricultu ral agencies responsible for leader ahlp. Bear PaMtie Ra-atlesa. I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political reat leaanea? In our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while various and complicated, are superncial rather than deep seated. Broadly, they arise from or are connected with the failure on tbe part of our Government to ar rive epeedlly at a Just nnd perma nent peace permitting return to nor mal condltiona, from the transfusi, ? of radical theorlea from seething Kuropean centers pendili**- auch delay, from heartless profiteering resulting In the increase of the coat o! living, and lastly from the machina'toi? of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal condition? this unrest will rapidly disappear. In the meantime. It does much evil, ft ?eema to t?? that In dealing with thla situation Congre?? should not b:? im patient or drastic, but -ihould t?eek rather to remeve the cause?. It ahould endeavor to bring our country back speedily tq a peace baals, with ameliorated living conditions utid^r the minimum of rearrictions upon per sonal liberty that is* consistent v-'.th our reconstruction problema. And it ahould arm the Federal ??overnmeit with power to deal in It? criminal courta with those persons wh ? i?v violent methoda would abrogvo ?'???r time-tested Inatitutlona. With tie free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly peliti ?I change, however fundamental, there muat be no interference, but towards paeslon and malevolence tending to Incite crins? and insurrection under guise of political evolution there ahould be no leniency. Legislation to this end haa been recommended by the Attorney General ??nd should be en acted. In this direct connection I would call your attention to mv rec ommendations of August *?th. [.?jint^iir out legislative measures which would be effective in controlling an.l bring ing down the present cost of living. which contributes eo largely to thla unrest. On only one of these recom mendations has the Congreaa acted. If the Government's campaign la to be effective, it ia necessary that the other steps suggested ahould be acted on at once. ?*, ?aid ? xtenS te*** ?octroi Aet. I renew and strongly urge the ne cessity of the extension of the pr? s ent food control act aa to the pen.i.l of time In which it shall remain In operation. The Attorney General h e submitted a bill providing for an ex tenaion of thia act for a p<Ticd of .-?.?? months. A? it now stands it ia limit? ?1 In operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace. It 13 ? Imperative that it should be extended at once. The department of Justice haa built up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforcing its provis ional all of whi.-h muat be at.anloned upon the conclusion of peace unies? the provialons of this act are extend ed. During thia period the Congress will have an opportunity to make sim ilar, permanent provisions and i-agu-l lations with regard to all goo<ls ? tine?l for Interstate commerce and to exclude them from interstate er-'p- ] ment, if the requirement? of the lata ' are not complied with. Some eu? ? regulation i? imperatively necessary. Th?- abuses that have grown up in the manipulation ot price? by th?? withholding of foodatuff? and ottier necessaries of life cannot other??. be effectively prevented. There can | be no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy at such rneasur? | As I pointed out in my ]a?t mesaa?,'?.?, publicity can accomplish a great <i . In thla campaign. The aim? of tli.?; Government muat be clearly brougr.t to the attention of the consuni'r^ public, civic organization? and Slat?? officiala, who are In a po itlon to, lend their aaalatance to our "efforts. You have made available fun la with which to carry on thia campaign, b'.t there ia no provlaion in the law au thorizing their expenditure for the purpose of making the public firlry Informed about the effort? of tl??? Government. ?Specific recommenda tlon has been made by the Attorney tleneral in thla regard. I woul I ; strongly urge upon you ita immedi ate adoption, as it constitutes one of the preliminary atepa to tbla cam paign. I also r?new my r??eommendatt >n ? thai tbe Congreaa pass a law ra?gu 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE AT A GUN CE President urged adoption of the budget system. Aaked for permanent auditors In the Treasury Department. Urged simplification of taxes. Asked an International financial program. Quoted from his. last message asking recognition and relief to soldiers and establishment of a chemical and dyeetuff Induetry. I'rped aid to farmers with Fed eral help in the matter of good roada. conservation of foreet re sources, country schools, and ru ral sanitation. Called the present political un rest superficial. and not deep seated, and urged Congress to-re move causes. Asked nw* extension of food control act for six months. Urged paasage of coal storage laws, use of price tags, and Fed eral license of all corporation? doing Interstate business, as out lined In hia high cost of living meseage. In dealing with labor question. asked that grievances between capital and labor be removed. Asserted rights of labor to col lective bargaining and held that individuili right to strike is invio late. lating cold etorage as It le regula?,??! for example, by the laws of the Stn;e of New Jersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept In etorage, prescribe the method of ?t?? poalng of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require tha1. goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their ro ceipt. It would materially add to the serviceability of the law. for the pur pose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods re leased from storage for Interstate shipment should have plainly mark??! upon each package the selling or market price at which they went Into storage. By this means the purchaser* would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. I would aleo renew my recommen dation that all goods destined for in ! terstate commerce should In every | case, where tlieir form or package makes it possiti?*, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer. W?? should formulate a law requir ing a Federal license of all corpora tions engaged in interstate commerce and embodying In the license, or in the conditions under which It is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and pre vent unconscionable profits In the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the business of interstate shipment and in the methods of corporations whicn are engaged In it; but for th* moment I confine my recommenda tions to the object Immediately in hand, which is to lower tbe cost of living. Labor *?< iu.-it ion Importaat. No on?- who bas observed the march of events in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite ?program to bring about an improve ment In the conditions of labor. There can be no settled conditions leading to increased production and a reduction in the cost or living If labor and capital are to be antagonists in stead of partners. ?Sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the In terests of th*> whol?* ration, a- dlstln gulshi-d from thu. irrtere-sts of a class, must be applied to tb? solution of this great ami pressing problem. The failure of otiier nations to consider this matter In a vigorous Way has produced bitterness and Jealousies and antagonisms, the food of radicalism. The only way to keep men from agi tating against grievances Is to re move the grievances. An unwilling ness even to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to th* extreme elements in our country which endeavor to ?tir up disturbances in order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. The seed.of revolution is repression'. The remed?- for th< ?e things must not be negante in character. It must be cone_fu<._lve. It mu?t comprehend the general intere-'. The real antidote for the unrest which manlfeet.. Itaelf Ie not suppression, but a deep consid eration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy. Congress has M ready shown its willingness to deal with these indus trial wrongs by establishing the eight hour day as the standard in every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to prev. nt child labor. It has served the who;? count? by leading th* way in developing the means of preserving and safeguarding* the lives md health in iaagerous Industries. It must now help in the difficult task of rinding a method that will brini, about a genuine democrat!, u:.m of industry, based upon the f?ll r, ..gnition of the right of those who work. In whatever rank, to participi!? In some organic way in every decision which directly affect*, their welfar??. it in with this purpose in mind tha* I called a con ference to meet in Wa ?ington on De cember 1, to con.-id?*r Unta? problems in all their broad aspects, with the id? a of bringing shout 11 better un derstanding between illese two in terests. ???? l'ut nur Hon?? in Order. The great unrest throughout the world, out of Which haa emerged a demand for an imm< <i at?? considera tion of the difficult?s between cap ital and labor, bids ua put our own houe?; in ? nier. Frankly, there <-an be no permanent an?! lusting settle ments between capii: tl and labor which do not reoognlz.? th.- lundamen tal concepta for which labor has been struggling through tl,. yetara. The whole world -.ave its re...gnition and indorsement to these fundamental purposes In the I.eagu?? of Nations. The statesmen gathered at Versailles recognized the fact that world sta bility could not be had hy reverting !o industrial standards and conditions against whi'li the average workman of ih. world had revolted it ie, there lore, the task of the statesmen of thle new day of change and readjustment to recognize world conditions and to seek to bring about, through legis lation, conditions that will mean the ending of age-long antagonisms be tv.t-.ri capital and labor and that will hopefully lead to the building up of a comradeship which will result not only in greater contentment among the mase of workmen but aleo brin?.? about a greater production and n greater prosperity to busin's? Itself To analyze the particular? In the demands of labor is to admit the Jus tice of their complaint In many mat tar? that lie at their basi??. TU.- work man demands an adequate wage, suf ficient to permit him to live In com fort, unhampered by the fear of pov erty and want in his old age. He de Um? righi lo Uta ?__4 Ut? ??#-__? to work amidst sanitary surroundings, both In home und in workshop, sur roundings that develop and do not retard hi? own health und well-being, and the right to provide for his chil dren'a wanta in the matter of health and education. In other words. It is hi? desire to make the conditiona of hla life and the Uvea of those dear to him tolerable and easy to bear. League Principle?. Vital. The establishment of the principles ' regarding labor laid down In the cov I enant of the League of Nations offers ! ua the way-to Industrial peace and con ! dilation. No other road lies open to ua. Not to pursue thla one ie longer Ito Invite enmities bittern??.?-, and an | tagoniama which |n the end only le ?d to induatrial'and social disaster. ? '1 unwilling workman is not a profltab..; servant. An employe whose industrial life is hedged about by hard and un Juat conditions which he did not cre iate and over which he has no control, lacka that fine spirit of enthusiasm land volunteer effort which are the necessary Ingredients of a great pro ' ducine entity. Let u? be frank about I thia aolemn matter. The evidences of ? world-wide unrest which manifeat themselves in violence throughout the world bid ua pause and consider the mean? to be found to stop the spread of this contagious thing before it saps the very vitality of the nation itself. Ijo we gain strength by withstanding the remedy? Or is It not the business of statesmen to treat theae manifesta tion? of unrest which "meet us on every hand as evidences of an eco nomic disorder and to apply construc tive remedie? wherever nccessarv being sure that in the'application of the remedy we touch not the vital tisauea of our industrial and economic life? There can be no recession of the tide of unrest until constructive in strumentalities are aet up to ?tern that tide. Governments muat recognize the right of men collectively to bargain for humane objects that have at their base the mutual protection and ? ti fare of those engaged in all indus trie?. ? ..??.? must not be longer treated aa a commodity. It must be regarded as the activity of human beings, possess? d of deep yearnings and desires. The business man gives hi? beat thought to the repair and re plenishment of his machinery, so that It? usefulness will not be Impaired and Its power to produce may always be at ita height and kept In full vigor and motion. No less regard ought to b<? paid to the human machine, which aft?-r all propels the machinery of the world and Is the great dynamic force that lies back of All industry and progreas. Return to the old stand ards of wage ami industry in em ployment are unthinkable. The terri ble tragedy of war which has Just ended and which has brought the world to the verge of chaos and dis aster would be in vain if there should ensue a return to the conditions of the past. Kurope itself, whence has come the unrest which now holds the world at bay, ie an example of atand patism tn these vital human matters which America might well accept as an example, not to be followed but studiously to be avoided. Kurope made labor th? differential, and the price of it all ia enmity and antagon ism and prostrated Industry. I The right of labor to live in peace and comfort must be recognize-' by Gov ernmenta, and America should be the flrat to lay the foundation stonee upon which Industrial peace sh--.ll b?> built. Labor i? not only entitled to an ad equate wage, but capital ahould re ceive a reasonable return upon its In vestment and ia entitled to protectt??? at the handa of the government in every emergency. No government worthy of the name tan "play" these elements against each other, for. there is a mutuality of interest between them which aeek to .exprea? and JU> saf.?guard at all edit. ' The right?, of Individuals to strike Is inviolate and ought not to be In terfered wlA by any process of gov ernment., but there is a predominant right and that la the right of the government to protect all of its peo ple and to assert its power and majesty againat the challenge of anv claaa. The government, when it aa aerta that right, seeks not to antag onize a class but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable har.n and injury that might be done by the attempt by any clase to uaurp a power that only gov ernment itself has a right to exer else as a protection to all. In the matter of international putea which have led to war, **ti men have sought to set up as a raUP ? edy arbitration for war. I'oes this not point the way for the settlement of industrial disputes which in the past have led to war and disaster? America, witnessing th?- evil conse quence? which have followed out of such disputes between these contend ing forces, muat not admit itself im potent to deal with these matters l.y means of peaceful processes. Surely, there must be some method of bring ing together in a council of peaci- and amity these two great interests, out of which will come a happier day of peace and co-operation, a day that will make men more hopeful and en thusiastic in their varimi.? tasks, that will make for more comfort and hap piness In living and a more tolerable condition among all classes of men. Certainly human intelligence can de vise some acceptable tribunal for ad Justing the difference?? between cap ital and labor. This ia the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess and strength, and the indomitable courage of lier soldiers, she demonstra*?*??! her power to vindicate on for.-ii.-n battl?? flelds her concept tans of liberty .-?nil Justice. Let not her influence as n mediator between capitili ami labor be weakeried and her own faltan ta settle ma'ters of purely dOBMStlC concern !??? proclaimed to the world. Hour of Trial In Ami-Hen. There are those In this country who threaten dlre?-t action to force their will upon a majority. Rasala to.lnv. with its blood and terror, is a painful? object lesson of the power of minori ties. It makes little different?.? what minority it is; v. heth.r capita] or labor, or any other class; no sort or privilege will ever l>.? permitted to dominate this country. We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while. We arc a democracy, where the majority are the masters, or all the hopes and purposes of the men who founded thi? Governm? nt have been defeated and forgotten. In America there Is but one way by which great reforms can be accom plished and the relief sought bv classes obtained, and thst is through the orderly processes of representa tive government. Those who Would propose any other m??thod of reform are enemies of this country. Am?-rica will not be daunted by threat? nor lose her composure or calmness In ttiese distressing times. We can af ford. In the midat of this day of pas sion and unrest, to be se'f-enntHined and sure. The Instrument of all re form in America is th.? ballot. The road to economic an?' sodai reform In America is the strHiirht road of justice ? all classes and conditions of m?-ii.
