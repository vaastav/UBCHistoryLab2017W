What promised to be a long and oh stinatteIy fouglht'iontest over the .qs ik . ership was ended Monday by the demo. ceatic caucus nominating George F Crisp of Georgia as its candidate for the speakership. Jioger Q. Mills of Texae was his most formidable opponent. It u can not he said there is any particular ipolitial sianificance in the election of thei Georgia gentleman over his Texas rival, though gossips have stated that the contest between them was really a contest between Iill and Cleveland for 1 the pr--sllintial nomination next year, ° Ifills friends supporting Crisp while C 'leveland's a imirers favored Mills. Nor .an it lie interpreted as meaning that a less vigorous light will be made against the tariff barons and the gigantic trusts created by the McKinley measure. The contest was one of individual preferences, no principle that would affe-t party in terests being involved. The election of Crisp makes Mills the leader of his party upon the tloor of the house. 11r. Crisp is a younger man than Mills. lie is an Englishman by birth, and came to America when quite a young boy. Ile has been a member of the house ten or twelve years. and a leader of his party in that hoily during the past three ses sions. It was. however, during the lust congress that he distinguished him self as a parliamentarian and a leader. He took up arms against Reed and proved himself more than a match for that autocrat in the chair. He met the Maine man at every point and whether in argument or wit lie overwhelmed him and made hin atppear the parliamentarian freehoot-r that he was. Tiim Reid still carries many a sting inflicted by Crisp. he is by long idds the best parliantment arian in either branch of congress. The election of Crisp makes the fourth speaker the democrats have had since the war-Kerr of Indiana. Sans Randall of l'ennsylvaiia. and Carlisle of Ken tucky. Honors are even two northern and two southern men. Speaker Crisp's political creed may te reduced to a few words. In his letter to the New York World in answer to inquiries lie said: "Reduce taxation; permit some reasonable competition in the market; destroy trusts: accord equal rights to all and special prhitleges to none. (live the farmer fret salt; give him free cotton ties: give him some re huetion on his hats, on his woolen clothes ano on his cotton goedts. You cannot increase the price of the farmers' products by protective tariff duties but you can decrease to them the cost of production and of living by reducing the tariff on those articles used to make the-r i-ops and on those articles of nec essity which all fantilies must mse.' 'hI'e inference from these is plain. Mr. Crisp woutl reduce the tariff on comn modaities which the agricultural classes Consume. He is the friend of the labor ing man and would adjust the tariff in his interest and not in the interest of griat trusts amd grasping corporations. Iie is aiunm on the silver question. The white te-tal will not suffer it his hands. this totes are on record as favoring free ioinage. hie will not stultify it by any alverse ttion upon his part.

THE 

SALARY GRAB ILLEGAL The citizens of Great Falls withoui - exception as far as the TRiuizE coUk - learn, are justly indignant at the at tempt of tlh mayor and aldermen to vote themselves salaries and back pay. Tih º matter has been further investigated and t it is now absolutely certain that the ac tion of the would-he grabbers was pre. I mature, illegal and of no effect. I reat Fulla is not a city of the first class and City Attorney lac-lin never gave an opinion to that effect. In answer to an inquiry lie simply sauid that the mayor and aldermen of cities of the first clans are entitled to receive compensation, naminig the maximum amount. This was lhe full extent of the opinion tliit led to the salary grah action of Monday night and it is evident the mayor anti councilhnen were Busily influenced in that direction. Our readers will le glad to know, how ever, that there is not the least possibil ity of the scheme being carried through. as it is in violation of the churter and wholly without warrant of law. We do not raise the question as to whether or not the mayor and members of the council are entitltec to compensa tion for their services doubtless they are-lut it is generally conceded to be nothing less than outrageous for such a body to vote themselves silaries and seven months back pay. The salary grab lill in congress caused more political deaths than any other measure ever brought before that body. Our mayor and aldermen should profit by this his torical fact. 1I ."iNMAA-R:ns REiRORT. The full text of Pitstmaster t Jenral WYcicanuaker's report is at hand. It is it voluminous document and embraces within its covers a vast amount of stht istical and other information concern ing the postal service of the country and its condition at the present time. The most notable departure le made in the conduct of his otlice was the requesting of postmasters of county seats to furn ish data as to the condition etc. of other offices in the county. There are 2,1307 counties in the country and nearly 65, 100 postotilces. The responses are in teresting, if not instructive. One of the questions propounded was: "Is the postoitee used as a place for lounging? The answers to this question could till a hook. As to penny postage Mr. Wanamnaker says it cannot te reached before 18141. He has figured it down to it day, lie helieves, just as lie would compute the cost of the giasds and wares in his Philadelphia house. He believes electricity should be pressed in to the postal service in telegraphy and telephony. He recommends the exten sion of the postal delivery system into seia I cities and villages and would even carry it into the rural districts. He is still bent on driving lottery matter out of the mail pouches though he estimaites the government has lost it million dollars of revenue a year by forbidding the nails to the lottery people.

TIMBER REGULATIONS. The Trlnt NE was the first paper in I the state to take up arms against Mr. Carter's absurd timber rules and regula tions, and about the only one which has persistently opposed them. But it is pleased to learn that it now has an able ally in the Inter Mountain. That journal has heretofore preserved the silence of the graveyard coniereieg the regulations but the protest against them recently is sueed by Butte nill and lumbermen has compelled it to show its hand. In refer ring to the protest in its issue two or three dius ago it ravs: "Apparently the regulations are tli rrmanifestly unjust and impracticable to le in plied to the northwest minder existing cnnditionrs. The objjections of the Tuin 'Itiers were based upon those grironds. It has hold ani it still holds that the regulations are unjust and impracticable: that they were formulated upon it misconception of the requirements of the northwest. and that Mr. Carter should radically nmlify them or rescind them altogether. Timber merolt te ried rby our sirlting and mining lien and farrers. None is cut for export out of the state: it is ill used at hunoe. This being the ease it is absurd as will us unjust to compel men to lose time and incur expense to get a permit to cut timber which someone must cut in order to supply the demand for it. A miner or a fanner may go upon the public domain and cut timber for his individual use, but M1r. Carter's regulations forbid any other party from cutting and selling it to either without first obtaining a permit front the interior department. This is absurd. This is by no means the only abrurd ity contained in the regulations. As well stated in the protest referred to nearly all the annual supply of timber cut for use is cut in the winter when thlmiountO' ame sides are covered with snow. The piling and burning of all the tops and other unused portions of a tree at that seas-n of the year is an impossibility. and yet Mr. Carter's regulations impsnes a penalty ulponn the wuodrlnari who fails to burn them. The regulations also pro vide that only certain trees shall be cut upon a given area and a penalty is at tached to their violation in this respect. The absurdity of this regulation is shown in the fact that timbernren do not waste their time and spend money to cut unavailable timber, and Mr. Carter should not forbid them taking such as may ie useful to them. The regulations are a mass of absurdities from beginning to end. If the preservation it our forests be Mr. Carter's object he saould forbid the cutting of timber outside of certain pro scribed limits. Or congress might set apart certain lands upoi our mountains as timber reserves upon which woodmen shall le forbidden to enter. Mr. Carter s object is doubtless to prevent a waste of timber upon the public domain, but he has adopted an unjust and impracticable plan to aictnplith it. Ihis plan. not his object. is attacked. ii.111 ISl N UENE t '1 7..

THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A very brief synopsis of this impor tant state paper was received by the - Turnisa, but doubtless its more impor s tant features were outlined. The views s of the president upon the tariff and the a silver questions have undergone no I change, notwithstanding the people of f several states have recorded their con s demnution of the republican tariff and silver policy since his Inst annual mes s sage to congress. lie notifies democratic - i'iners that he will veto any radical r changes in the tariff they may make as he says 'such changes could not. help t and might seriously injure business." T'f'll notification, however, will not deter ildecrats fronm proposing a modification of several of the important features of I the McKinley Act. Some of theni may pass the smnat' when the opportunity will lie preslnted to him to write his roy I al "nl" against them. The president will veto a free anld on limited silver coinage bill. He will be given tlt- opportunity to dt it. for one will smiely pass both houses this winter. Th11' l' Writ i can pass one in the I house, and with the help of western re publican senators they can pass one in I the senate. president Harrison must then assume the responsibility of deny ing free coinage to the people of the country. Ile will doubtless assume it under the press ef Wall street gold hugs who cannot save him from an over whelmning defeat if he run for the pres idency next year. The people cannot expect any relief from dear money from President Ilarrison and a large majority of retiubliean colgr'sslen. 'T'hey are joined to a single standard and belong, oady anil soul. to the gold bugs. Nothing' new as learned concerning the New Orleans lynching matter. It remains just where it was heft when the Italian minister left 'iishington in a huff, and the Italian government made a holy almow of itself In its denqands upon this government for indemnity for the dead Matlas. The Chilian natter is treated at some length, but nothing new is revealed in. the message. The president simply re cites what has already appeared in our dispatches. After stating the facts in the use as the government learned them he says the Chilian government has been notitied that unless qualifying facts which might tend to relieve the affair of an insult to this covernment be forth coming it would certainly expect a full and prompt reparation. Chili has not yet made 1any reparation and it is very doubtful whether it will. The attack upon and maltreatmnent of the Baiti mlores men is being investigated by the Chlilian authorities and Ilur government is patiently awaiting the result. That is where the matter now stands. 'l'th, smuggliing of Chinilmen utross our northern border is referred to by the president whit retomntetas it tocon grosss it a lit sutbject fur corrective Ilegis litiln. I nder leeisions of our courts smlngled ('hininlll must be returned to the country frolt whence they umie.

I't;i'i .%) KN erities are reminded I l si was no issue of principle involved in the recent speakership contest. It was a con test detlerlIinedl only by Individual pref 4ern4es. Many of Mr. Mills' own friends ,encede he would be liable to exhibit temper in a struggle icer nice points in parliamentary law. while Crisp is dis tinguished for his coolness under all eircumnstaners. 'The knowledge of this latter fact 4int the inuiness for the I eorgia man. ColoN iNaI) 1Ir.

FREE SILVER. A complete poll of the memher present congress made by the Newr y Press discloses the tact that no a looking to the free coinage of silver be passed over the president's vet,, Press figures that in the senate then thirty-six free coinage democrate eighteen free coinage republican the same body it tinds thirty reiubli against free coinage and three d.n'1 against it, Brice not being (ounlel either side. In the house of representativx same paper finds 162 (denern;t nine republicans in favor of free ,, and seventy republicane and ti )., democrats against it.

'ihe figures, however, elusively show that a free coinage em bill can pass both houses on the One will doubtless be passed, leaving responsibility of its defeat upon shoulders of the president. OThe figures establish another f which we pass over to the Inter Moun alo for its consideration. The New Y Press is a republican sheet and there? our Butte contemporary can not v well charge that the figures of the N York paper are democratic lies. '1 establish what the Inter Mountain never been willing to concede-- that large majority of democratic congre, men favor free coinage while but an is significant minority of republican ,m gressmen favor it. They establish an other fact and that is: it we ever get fru coinage we will get it from the deam cratic party, which is silver's only friend in the country. I V IlL
