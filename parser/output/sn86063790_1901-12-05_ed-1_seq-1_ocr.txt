' j opening of the first cession of the fiftyseventh congress at nccn Monday thronged the capitol with spectators, eager to witness the scenes of animation which mark the annual reassemb. hang of the national law-makers. Although the actual work of the two houses was not begun until 12 o'clock, the historic old structure?now refurnished from end to end until it shone with marble, gilt and rich decorations ?was astir long before that hour. It was an ideal day to bring out the (public, sunny and warm, with just enough breeze from the south to lazily etir the flags over the capitol, some oi which were raised for the first time since the adjournment of congress . nine months ago. There was no entrance restrictions and the crowd flowed uninterruptedly into the building. Many ladies were in the throng, including the wives and families of senators and members, as well as many of the feminine representatives of the cabinet, diplomatic and executive circles. In the House. The very handsome interior of the fcall nf rpnrpspntaHves added much to impressiveness of the general scene a* the south end of the capitol when Alexander McDowell, of Pennsylvania, I - called the new house of representa| tives to order at noon. The lobby in the rear of the hall was filled with floral emblems sent to popular members. There were tons of flowers and a glance through the lobby was like a [ vista through a flower garden, r As a rule, the leaders on both sides were slow in making their appearance. Mr. Richardson, of lennessee, took his old place about the center of the minority side shortly after 11 o'clock.

TARIFF REFORM I Slogan is Raised in Democratic Cancns at Washington. RICBARDSON MINORITY LEADER 1 j i Short and Sharp Fight Made Over ( Resolutions Offered By the New i York Delegation, But No i Action Taken. * 1 A Washington special says: The democratic members of the house of representatives met in caucus in the j hall Df the house at 11 o'clock Saturday. There are 151 democrats; and eight fusionists, silverites and populists In the new house. Of these members of the minority 126 were present, including Mr. Shafrotk, of Colorado, andMr. Newlanas, silverites. Mr. Ne! ville and Mr. Stark, populists, of Ne- , braska, declined to enter the caucus. , Mr. Hay, of Virginia, chairman of the : I democratic caucus, presided. Without > opposition the following selections J were made for officers of the house to ( be presented at the meeting of -1 the house Monday. 1 Speaker, Mr. Richardson, of Tennes- ! see; clerk, ex-Representative James ' | Kerr, of Pennsylvania; sergeant at arms, ex-Representative E. V. Brook- ^ shire, of Indiana; doorkeeper, Charles [ Edwards, Texas; postmaster, James K. 1 I Jackson, of Alabama. The selection of Mr. Richardson as candidate for speaker clothes him offi- ' i fKrt minrtrifw 1 oo rl n ' | L, I d H J VT 1IU CUC- aiiuviiv; v.r. Mr. Richardson briefly thanked 'tttf caucus for the honor done him. The interesting portion of the caucus followed. Representative McClellan, of New York, by direction of the dem- 1 ocratic members of the New York dele- ' gation who had met just prior to the assembling of the caucus, offered a ! resolution as an expression of the sense of the caucus which, in part, was as follows: "Resolved, That we shall promote to ' the utmost of our power the removal of the oppressive, restrictive and often ( prohibitory features of the existing tariff. It has been truly declared to be , the mother of trusts. The tendency to create combinations of wealth, establishing practical monopolies in the manufacturing and commercial industries of the United States, threatens ] the future existence of individual manufacturers and merchants and tradesmen of moderate or small means. "2. We shall favor just and generous treatment of the inhabitants of Porto . Rico and Cuba. American obligations to Cuba should be sacredly performed. "3, We are opposed to the subsiay bill presented at the last session as calculated to create a shipping monopoly. "4. We shall oppose the use in any forn of the money of all the people for the exclusive benefit of private interests. "I). We shall insist upon the sacred force of the fundamental American rule of democratic self-government Whatever protectorate over newly-aoquii-ed islands or lately conquered peo- ; pie may be necessary for a longer jor a shorter time, whatever limited sites for naval stations may properly be retained or acquired by the United States, we are opposed to any incorporation into our republic of other lands or ::he assumption of sovereignty over them, except as ineir inhabitants may be fitted for self-government, and except as the protection of our constitution no less than of our flag may be extended to them with safety to ourselves." The presenting of this resolution precipitated a row. Mr. Richardson attempted to prevent the reading of it by a motion to refer all resolutions to a special committee of twelve, who should report at a future caucus; but this motion was ruled out of order pending the reading of the resolution. When the reading was concluded Mr. Ball, of Texas, gave notice that he would offffer the Kansas City platform as a substitute. This brought replies from Mr. Fitzgerald, of New York, and ) Mr. McDermont, of New Jersey, both of whom protested against the injection of the financial issue into the democratic councils. "We can never win," declared Mr. Fitzgerald, "if we no not discard the heresy of free silver." "We can never win," retorted Mr. Ball, unless men calling themselves democrats support the national platform of the democratic party." After further sharp exchanges, Mr. Richardson succeeded in quelling the disturbance by renewing his motion to refer all resolutions to a special committee of twelve to be appointed by the chairman of the caucus. The motion prevailed. Public Debt Decreased. At the close of business October 31, 1901, the public debt, less cash in the treasury, was $1,022,032,957, a decrease from last month of $9,563,408. The ca.sh balance was $325,655,697. Missing "Base" Silver Found. The ton of "base" silver bullion which so mysteriously disappeared from the Omaha criminal court room, was hauled to the smelter.

Dying Man Tells Story of a Tragic and Mysterious Murder Committed Over Thirty Years Ago. A special from Jackson, Miss., says: The slow sureness of God's retributive ustice is strikingly illustrated in the Vlltchell murder mystery, which has iust been made clear in Amite county ifter a lapse of thirty-one years. The lonfessicn of a dying man clears up a leretofore impenetrable halo of dark less and removes the stigma from the Ascutcheon of a family suspected of participation in the bloody deed, notwithstanding the acquittal after a spir ted battle in tbe criminal courts. On the 28th day of January, 1870, i prosperous farmer named Antone Mitchell was assassinated at his plan:ation home near the town of Liberty, :he seat of Amite county, and several :housand dollars stolen from his person. The old man had just returned !rom town, where he had marketed 100 bales of cotton and received the money therefor in gold and bills. Experienced detectives were sent for to investigate the crime and a few lays later the McCoy brothers, three young men who had hitherto borne good reputations in the county, were placed under arrest and tried for the prime. They were acquitted, but many persons still believed in their guilt until a few days ago, when the confession of a dying man removed the veil pf mystery. Mitchell was killed by four of the best known citizens of the county, men who had been his friends and neighbors for many years, and they were never suspected of participating in the crime, but continued to live almost within the very shadow of the pounty temple of Justice. The four men were Colonel Frank ? "Till! TTT?1J__ T> TT n rowers, vviniam weiuuu, xv. xi. uxv,Clelland and Winans Campbell. The latter made -the confession which solves the mystery. With the last gasps of breath he told the story of the crime, sparing not a single detail or attempting to shield the men who bad participated with him in the bloody deed. Justice is cheated in the end, however, for the other three men are long since dead and almost forgotten by the p6opb who formerly knew them. Campbell confessed that he killed Colonel Powers in a roadside duel, and this killing had also been a mystery until his death-bed story was related. Weldon met a violent death at Bayou Sara, La., fifteen years ago, and the miserable ending of the entire quartet forms one of the most tragic chapters In Mississippi's criminal history. A wtness who perhaps could have cleared up the myste::y at the time oi the McCoy trial got drunk wnne we hearing was in progress, became boisterous on the streets and resisted the sheriff, w?o attempted to place him under arrest whereupon the officer shot him dead. CONSUMPTIVES ARE BARRED. Judge Sustains An Important Ruling of the Treasury Department. United States Judge Thomas, sitting In the United States circuit court in Brooklyn, N. Y., Friday decided in favor of the ruling of the treasury department at Washington in the case of Thomas Boden, of Philadelphia. The decision prohibits Boden, a supposed consumptive, from remaining in the country. Unless the case is appealed to the circuit court of appeals, Boden will be deported. Boden's wife and child have remained, from choice, at Ellis island, and will acompany Boden back to Ireland, Judge Thomas decides that, as a simple question of fact was before hiir in the premises, he could not officially do otherwise than sustain the treasurydepartment No question of law, he observed, bas been propounded m tne writ of habeas corpus sued out by Bo den's lawyer. The case has to do with the right of consumptives to land here as immigrants.

CAUSED BY BOILER EXPLOSION In Addition to Fearful Fatalities Twentw-Four Other Men Are In Various Hospitals Suffering Fron Terrible Injuries. A special from Detroit, Mich., says: Twenty-six men are dead, five of them unidentified and so terribly burned and blackened that identification is al most impossible, and twenty-four other men are lying in various hospitals of the city suffering from terrible cuts and burns and other injuries, all results of the explosion of one of the boilers in the Penberthy Injector Company's large plant at the corner of Abbot street and Brooklyn avenue at 9:30 o'clock Tuesday morning. Following -are the dead: A. E. Hoffman, Louis Henning, Patrick Malloy, A. E. Miller, Eugene Bertram, R. Mulkee, Joseph Coffey, Chas Marvin, Joseph Roseck, Stephen Crisp, George Schenor, Charles Lydy, Jacob Reotel, William Mann, Christopher Walman, Robert Creer, Edward Burch, John Schaible, Richard Ryan, Douglass Dickinson, boy; Peter Boll, and five unidentified bodies. In addition to the twenty-four injured in hospitals, a dozen or more of the employees who suffered comparatively slight Injuries, aside from the shock, were taken to their homes. Eighteen men and boys have not as yet been located, either at their homes or at the hospitals. The five unidentified bodies account for five of these, .1 ?00 eQV auu 1116 Uallicia VI LUC vuiiiyau; ou; they feel positive that the major portion of tLe remaining thirteen are safe. The Penberthy Injector Company's plant occupied half a square at the corner of Abbot street and Brooklyn avenue. It was composed of two brick buildings, separated by a 16-fo9t alley. The rear building, in which the boiler we located and which was completely destroyed, was three stories in height, 54 feet in depth and 100 feet wide. It is impossible to tell exactly how many men were at work in the various de' partments of this rear building when 1 the exp csion occurred, but the officers insist that the number was not over j eighty-five. There were four boilers ' in the plant, two horizontal ones which 1 furnished steam for the engines and two vertical boilers, which were used 1 solely to test injectors. It was the hor' izontal boiler that was in use and ' which let go and caused the awful loss of life. Came Without Warning. Tiie awful crash came witnout me slightest warning. Those in the front 1 building said it seemed like a concussion of an immense cannon. The roof ' and floors of the rear building bulged 1 upward and then crashed down with their heavy load of machinery and | foundry apparatus. Walls, roof and all dropped into a shapeless mass of debris. Windows in houses for a block around were broken by the concussion, and flying bricks filled the neighboring yards. A dense cloud of dust arose, ' and as it settled and was succeeded by denser clouds of smoke and steam, agonized cries began to come from the tangled wood, metal and bricks. Those who were only partly buried frantically dug themselves out, and then as energetically turned to digging for their comrades, who were buried deeper. Flames broke out almost immediately, and the horror of fire was added to the suifering of the imprisoned 01168. A fire alarm was turned in and quickly responded to. Calls were sent out for all the ambulances in the city, anc'l they were hurried to the scene. Pending their arrival, neighboring houses were turned into temporary hospitals, and those physicians who were in the vicinity eased the sufferers as much as they were able. The first ambulances on the scene were totally inadequate to carry those who had al ready been extricated, and express wagons and similar vehicles were , pressed into service. As socn as the gravity of the accident was realized, calls for additional | firemen were sent in and the apparatus came flying to the scene from all parts of the city. While part of the firemen > turned their efforts at the fire which was burning fiercely in the center of the wreck, the greater number of them seized axes and crowbars and began pry out the victims who could be seen or whose faint cries were audible, t The department of public works was " notified of the horror and immediately - sent all its available men and horses to the scene.

Details cf a Bloody Tragedy Enacted In the Isolated Mountain Section of South Carolina. Particulars of the murder of Mrs. Rachel Powell, alias Thomas, by whitecaps, in the mountains of Oconee county, South Carolina, 17 miles from a telegraph office, were received in Co lumbla Tuesday night. Ten young white men, mostly well connected, are already in Oconee jail, while warrants are being issued for others. Powell and the woman who was killed were under indictment for adultery. Mrs. Powell was 50 years old. They had five children, who witnessed the killing of their mother. According to Powell's sworn statement, late Sunday night a crowd came to his house. They had tools of all descriptions and proceeded to tear down the house. They demolished the chimney, tore off the roof and had attacked the walls when he came out. The first four men he saw were recognized as the Hudson boys. He attacked them with a piece of plank and knocked Moned Hudson down. About this time Mrs. Powell came to the door and the crowd fired on her. She fell, shot through the heart. The crowd then fled. Three of the Hudsons were arrested twenty-five miles from the scene of the crime, just as they were preparing to cross over into Georgia.

Trains Carrying Heavy Load of Hainan Fright Go Together. FEARFUL LOSS OF LIFE RESULTS First Reports Placed Number of Fatalities at From 80 to 100?Fire Broke Out and Many Bodies Are Cremated. From 80 to 100 persons were killed or injured Wednesday night In the most disastrous railroad wreck in the hi&tory of Michigan railroads. Two heavily loaded passenger trains on the Wabash railroad collided head-on at full speed one mile east of Seneca, tne second station west of Adrian. The west-bound train of two cars loaded with immigrants and fiye other coaches were smashed ana burned with the result of awful loss of life and fearful injuries t? a majority of its passengers. The east-bound train, the Continental Limited, suffered in scarcely less degree. The track in the vicinity of the j wreck was strewn with uead and dying. Many physicians from Detroit hurried to the scene. No. 4, the Continental Limited, it is believed, disobeyed orders in not waiting at Seneca for No. 13, thereby causing the wreck. Conductor Is Blamed. The track at the point where the collision occurred was straight, and at first the oflicials could not understand how the accident could have happened. No. 13, which ordinarily is due to leave Detroit at 2:3v o'clock, was two hours late, leaving at 4:20. The two trains meet at Montpelier, Ohio, according to schedule, but No. 4 had orders to wait for No. 13 at Seneca. The blame is therefore placed on the conductor or engineer of No. 4. Had this train been held at Seneca the accident would not have occurred. Train No. * was due at Seneca at 6:43, according to the change in schedule, but appa-< rently orders to wait were disobeyed. Advices from the wreck at midnight Wednesday night stated that the country for miles around was lighted up by the burning cars, and that the flames could not be quenched because of lack of proper apparatus. Mangled bodies were picked up along the track by the farmers before the special trains sent from Adrian arrived on the scene. In some instances the bodies were mangled beyond all recognition. The bodies which the rescuers managed to pull from the burning ruins of ihe immigrant cars were so badly burned that their identity will probably never be ascertained. As soon as the news of the disaster reached Division Superintendent Burns of Detroit the wires were kept hot ordering specials from Adrian, Peru and Montpelier to the scene of the wreck. A special train from Detroit carrying thirty-two physicians end surgeons started for Seneca and was given tiie right of way. When it reached the scene of the wreck the work was at once commenced succoring the woundr ed. Later advices state that Superintendent George M. Burns, of the division on which the wreck occurred, insists that the estimates of afatalities are too high. "I do not consider," said he, "that the total death list will exceed twenty." However, in support of the larger estimates, it is pointed out that there are now fourteen passengers known to be dead. The bodies of eight of these have been recovered, and it is considered that the fragments of other bodies now in the morgue at Adrian will account for many more than the twelve dead necessary to make up Superintendent Burns' estimate of twenty. In addition to the comparatively few fragments recovered and sent to the morgue, those who were early on the scene say that many more pieces were discovered which crumbled to powder vifeile they were being removed. IN FOG FERRY BOATS CRASH. Out of Nearly Two Hundred Passensengers Only Three Are Missing. At San Francisco Saturday night the ferry boats Sausalito and San Rafael collided in a dense fog and the San Rafael sank in between ten and fifteen minutes. It is thought that not more than three persons were drowned, althought the San Rafael carried between 150 and 200 passengers. The Saulsalito was not seriously Injured, and after rescuing all the passengers on the San Rafael that she could, she proceeded to San Francisco under her own steam. TO EXHIBIT PRIZE ANIMALS.
