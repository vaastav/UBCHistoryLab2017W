The Manitowoc Pilot ESTABLISHED 1859. MANITOWOC. WIS fHIS OPPORTUNITY AT LAST f'Mangan's Luck," Brave Policerrvan Called It, But the World Supplies Another Name. For IS years James Mangan walked his beat as a policeman of the Greater City, and In all that time nothing had happened to him, says the New York correspondent of the Cincinnati Times Star. His name never got in the re ports for bravery. He did his duty Well, Tint it came to him in the com mon and prosaic form it offers to the greatest run of men. His hair had begun to turn gray and the fire of youth had abated. His fellows in the fetation began to call him ''Pop." In kll those years he had not so much as stopped a runaway. No greengrocer Could have led a more placid life. Even the men he arrested, won by the good-natured smile, did not resist. The goddess of chance, that walks by every blue-clothed man upon his beat seemed to have forgotten him. And then, the other night, his chance bame to him. Ixicked on the top floor bf a burning building were two little Children. A weeping mother came and Mangan, with 18 years of kindly duty behind him, became a hero. He Struggled up to the locked door through a swirling hell of flame and smoke. Burned, half strangled, he burst in the door and gathered the lit tle ones In his arms, protected them under the heavy cloth of his uniform boat. Down the tottering stairway he felt his way, blinded and gasping. Half way down its flame-rotted timbers hroke beneath him and lie fell Even as unconsciousness came upon him, he still drew over the little children the skirts of his coat, and It was thus the firemen found him when they fought through the curtain of flames that barred their entrance. Mangan, they say. will die. "How are the kids?” he roused enough to r.ny. And when they told him that the boy and girl were safe a faint smile came to his blackened lips. “Mangan’s luck," he whispered. Marking an Old Trading Post.

CLAIM RESTRAINT OF TRADE Government Officials See Deliberate Violation of Sherman Anti-Trust Law Worked Under Cover of Patent Schemes. Detroit.—The government crusade against the ''bathtub trust” has shifted to Detroit, with the result that indictments were returned by the federal grand jury against six teen firms and thirty-two individuals alleged to have secured control of 85 per cent of the annual output of enamel Ironware bathtubs, sinks and accessories in the United States. The criminal proceedings grew out j of a civil suit to dissolve the alleged ! combination, begun by the govern ment. It is charged that as the re sult of a ten days' meeting at Mount Clemens, Mich., last April, a fund of $7,000 was subscribed to set in mo tion a plan that resulted in giving to the defendants control of sixteen manufacturers and nearly 400 job bers representing an output of ap proximately $10,000,000 per year. Both the civil suit started at Balti more and the criminal proceedings begun here were Instituted under the Sherman anti-trust, law. The government places great weight upon the testimony of Edwin J,.

To all intents and purposes he Is a dead man. Let him rest in peace. 1 have no doubt that Robert E. Peary reached the pole, but it is necessary that he should place scientific proofs of the fact before the public. To show these proofs to a few friends is not enough if he wishes to stand in the world’s history as the undisputed discoverer of the north pole. “Commander Peary must send his proofs to the University of Copen hagen, the most competent authority on arctic questions.” REBEL LEADER IS ARRESTED Juan Sancho Azcona Taken Into Cus tody by U.

BALL N6IR UPHELD CHARGES UNFOUNDED IS RE* j PORT OF INVESTIGATING COM MITTEE TO CONGRESS. : ACCUSERS ARE FLAYED , Report Charges Prosecution With An mosity Against Secretary Be cause of D fferences Over Con* servaton Policy. Washington.—Declaring all the charges brought against Secretary R. A. Ballinger were unfounded, and ascribing the accusations to the ani mosity developed as a result of sup posed differences In policy respecting conservation, the Ballinger-Finchot Investigating committee filed Its ma jority report to congress. The report was signed by Sena tors Knute Nelson, chairman; Frank P. Flint, George Sutherland and Eli -11 u Root and Representatives Samuel W. McCall of Massachusetts, vice chairman; Marlin E. Olmstead of Pennsylvania, and Edwin Denby of Michigan, all Republicans. After stating that the evidence presented related in the main to charges of various kinds against Mr. Ballinger and that these came chiefly ! from two sources—L. R. Glavis and j Gifford Pinchot —the majority an- ! nounced the following conclusion: “The evidence has wholly failed to make out a case. Neither any fact I proved nor all the facts put together | exhibit Mr. Ballinger ns being any- | thing but a competent and honorable | gentleman, honestly and faithfully ■ performing the duties of his high | office with an eye single to the public | interest.” On his own behalf, Representative j Madison, insurgent member of the I joint committee, finds that the Glavis charges should he sustained; that In j the disposition of the Cunningham coal lands Mr. Ballinger was not a faithful trustee of the public inter ests and did not properly protect such Interests: that the Pinchot charges should lie sustained and that the secretary has not shown himself to be that character of friend of the policy of conservation that a man | should be who occupies the impor- | tant office of secretary of the interior, I and should not be retained in office, j FOR LOWER MEAT TARIFF Reso'ution Presented in Congress Strikes at High Food Prices—Pack ers Raise Beef and Pork Prices.

The suggestion that the question be made the subject of an international conference find? little favor. The conservative Post calls the prop osition a specimen of American naivete in world affairs.

"To place the conduct of the negotia tions over this useless and dangerous question in the hands of the Amer icans,” it adds, “would Ik* of all courses the least suitable which could be found."

DIETZ PLEA DENIED SUPREME COURT REMANDS PRISONER TO CUSTODY OF SHERIFF MADDEN. QUASH HABEAS CORPUS WRIT Decision Holds There Is No Solid Ground for Contention of Illegal Imprisonment of “Defender Ot Cameron Dam.” Madison.—The supreme court granted the motion of the state to quash the writ of habeas corpus on which John Dietz was brought to Madison. He was remanded Into the custody of Sheriff Madden and was returned to Hayward to stand trial. Chief Justice Winslow read the de cision. “When,” he said, “I allowed the writ (on which Dietz was taken to Madison from the jail at Hayward) In this case, it was hard for me to see any solid ground for saying that the petitioner’s imprisonment was Il legal. However, the petition con tained the necessary formal allega tions, and It was presented by reput able attorneys. “It is a matter of common knowl edge that there have been many charges recently made to the effect that the petitioner was being relent lessly persecuted by the courts and officials of the law. It seemed to me that I should be careful not to create any situation which would make it possible for any one to charge that the door of the highest court of the state had been shut upon him with out even a hearing. In order that there might be an opportunity to present his claims just as strongly as possible, not only before myself, but before the entire bench, I determined to issue the writ. “The argument in support of the writ has now been heard and consid ered by the whole court. The court is unanimous in the opinion that the motion to quash must be granted. “If the writ be considered as used for the purpose of discharging the petitioner, it can not he effective be cause the petition shows on its face that he is lawfully held, under a valid commitment, for a criminal offense. “If the writ be considered as a writ issued for the purpose of com pelling the reduction of excessive bail or the admission to ball, or both, It can not be effective because, first, the ball of $lO,OOO for assault for attempt to murder does not seem to us excessive in view of the circum stances shown; second, the court can not admit to ball when the arrest has not yet been made.” All spectators were excluded from the court room. Dietz’ presence was not thought necessary and he re mained In the jail. A line of specta tors lined the way from the jail to the capitol in hopes of securing sight of the famous prisoner. Attorneys for Dietz. In presenting their petition, asserted that the bonds required were excessive and that the courts had abused their power of discretion. A feature of the arguments was Justice Timlin’s question as to whether or not Dietz wished to lump all the Indictments and secure a “wholesale rate” on the bonds.

TAFTCHQOSES WHITE SOUTHERNER TO SUCCEED LATE CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER ON SUPREME COURT BENCH. SELECTION IS A SURPRISE Designation of Assistant Justice Hughes, Ex-Governor of New York, as Chief Justice Had Been Regarded as Almost Certain. Washington. Associate Justice Edward Douglass White of the United States Supreme Court is to be elevated to the chief justiceship of that tribunal. President Taft will send the nomination to the senate and it is expected the two new asso ciate Justices, to fill vacancies on the bench, also will be named. The fore cast eliminates J. B. Winslow of Wisconsin, so far as present indica tions point. The announcement that Justice White will be the new chief justice undoubtedly will cause some sur prise. because It had been pretty gen erally understood for some time that Justice Charles E. Hughes was slated for that high honor. In the last two or three days, however, it became known that a change In the head of the Supreme Court slate might be made. Some of the president’s closest ad visers argued with him that Justice Hughes’ experience at the bar had not been sufficient to warrant his promotion at this time to the highest judicial position in the country. They claimed that Mr. Hughes' rep utation as a lawyer had been gained principally in his conduct of two leg islative investigations. They agreed with the president that everything pointed to a most brilliant career on the bench for the former gover nor. At the same time they offered the argument that Justice Hughes was the youngest man on the bench and that his opportunity for promo tion would come later when he would have had the advantage of the ma turing experience of having served several years on the bench. Justice White has been on the Supreme Court for sixteen years, and is now the oldest justice in com mission whose age is less than 70. He graduated from Georgetown Uni versity. In addition to practicing law in Louisiana he was a sugar planter. He served in the Louisiana legislature as a senator, served for a number of years on the State Su preme court, and subsequently was elected to the United States senate. He was serving his first term in that body when President Cleveland ap pointed him to the Supreme Court.
