MORNING LEADER. THURSDAY WOttMNG, DKC. 4, !. What is Thought of the Message in Washington. A dispatch from Washington says that the President'! Message if spoken of on all hands as the best written and best considered of any he has submitted. It is certainly a well-written, concise and in telligible document. Illness of Senator Doolittle. The Madison Journal states that Senator Doolittle is ljing quite ill of a fever. The Journal says; "It will be remembered that some time since he lost a son, who had contracted a fever while in the army. 8ince then nearly every member of the family has been attacked with it, and it has now prostrated Judge Doolittle himself." Promotions. Brigadier-General Hartsuff, of Michi gan, who was especially prominent in the earlier West-Virginia campaigns, has been promoted to a Major-Generalship, and Colonels Mohr, of the 28th Ohio, and Ly tic, of the 10th, to Brigadiers. Complete Success of the Passaic. The new Monitor Passaic made the trial voyage to Fortress Monroe in a perfectly oceetaful manner. By an improvement upon the Monitor, the leakage about the turret was entirely prevented. Trouble had been feared at sea from the impossi bility of using the compass in any ordi nary manner, without its being affected by the great mass of iron around it. This was obviated by the ingenious arrange ment of a looking-glass reflecting the movements of the compass to the wheels man, the compass itself being far removed from the deadening influence of the iron house. As to its sea-going qualities, a corres pondent writes to the Tribune : " The third principle tried is the general sea-going qualities of the new Monitors. Being water-tight, where alone water could always come, they are safe. If waves reached the top of the turret, they may wash over but cannot drown any body. The steadiness of the craft is won derful. Moving through the roughest tide, she is as free from rolling as one could well imagine; with fine engines she might team around the world. We are ordered to Washington. What is the business on hand for us it is not for me to say if I knew. Bnt Monitor No. 2 is successful, and that is good news enough for one letter." General Gilmore Again Snubbed. ' We have several times alluded to the pro-slavery orders of General Q. A. Gill more, who is engaged in returning fugi tive slaves in Kentucky. The following correspondence between the General and CoL Atkins, of the 92d Flinois, is interest ing. The General did not make much out of Colonel Atkins : 

LEXINGTON, KY., Nov. 18. 1862. Coiokel : It is reported to me that a civil process is to be served in your camp, and Judge Robertson requests me to drop you a line, intimating the course I pursue in such cases. I invariably recognise the civil law in all its operations, as martial law does not exist hare in Kentucky. We have no right to resist the execution of any civil prnfu, and an attempt to do so would render us amenable to the severe laws of this State. lean give you no or der, but would for the good of the cause recommend that the civil authorities be respected always. Tour obedient servant, Q. A. GILLMORE, Brig. General. Col. Atkins, Present. To the above document Colonel Atkins made the following satisfactory and sensi ble reply : lit CaJf r, two miles socth or LvxnroTos, ) November 19th, 18G2. J G Email: I have your note. I beg to state that I am under orders to proceed southward with my command, and I do not know at what moment I may find the enemy, and I cannot afford to fiddle away my time in hunting up niggers or in re plying to bills in chancery filed against me. When the war is over, and I am at leisure, I will answer any civil process, but I beg to assure you, General, that I am now altogether too busy with a terrible rebellion and bloody war, to be fooling away my time in writing answers to bills in chancery filed by secession sympathis ers. I have not resisted and do not expect to, for I have not a single nigger in my possession at all, but I cannot stop to an swer formally in court. Your obedient servant, SYITH D. ATKINS, Colonel. Q. A. Giu.-oas. Brigadier-General. A New Speculation. A Washington dispatch reports this latest specimen of fraudulent speculation : "An enterprising Western chemist has been attempting to engineer through the Surgical Department the adoption of gran ulated beef tea, as an addition to hospital stores, for the entire army, which he pro posed to furnish. The Surgeon General was on the point of giving a heavy order for it, bnt an analysis being made, it was found to contain no beef or muscle at all, and to be simply a preparation of starch. The speculation would have been one of very handsome proportion, and it came very near being successful." Ohio Democratic Plans. There was quite a reunion of the lately elected Democratic Congressmen of Ohio at Columbus on Thanksgiving day. The fol lowing dispatch to the New Tork Times is an intimation as to what wasgdiscussed : "It is stated that the Democratic Con gressmen elect from Ohio intend to make a formal demand upon the President that the political prisoners from that State shall either be released or have a speedy trial." The Sentiments of Russia. The Journal de St. Petersburg publishes the following statement : "We believe that the foreign powers have no right whatever to interfere in America. We also believe that no other Intervention would be possible than one similar to the advice which Russia has constantly tendered in a friendly spirit since the commencement of the struggle.' . The New York Herald says that so far as medical supplies and stores are con cerned, General Banks' expedition will be well cared for. The steamer Honduras has been chartered by the Government to trans port the supplies. Dr. E. H. Alexander, as experienced army surgeon, has been appointed Medical Director, and seven hospital stewards, independent of the or dinary regimental stewards, are also at tached. That's What's the Mimi ! The Col ' ambus Crisis, Ohio, says the Republicans of Iowa have gained their last'vietory. That's what the Tory sheets of this State have been saying for the last eight years 1 Meanwhile, the Republican majority has increased from 1,000 to 13,000. There is no falling off this year. The army vote kind o' getsj the Philistines. Iowa State Rtguttr. Among recent deaths in Washington hospital, was Hiram Cooler, Company D gereata Ohio. OS VOL. XVI. f 

CLEVELAND, THURSDAY MORNING. DECEMBER 4,-1862. NO. 289. Application for Pensions. From the report of the Commissioner of Pensions we quote the following, which is of interest to all contemplating an appli cation for a pension : i " In this connection it seems proper to refer to certain erroneous impressions which have prevailed in eome quarters, as to the existence of serious obstacles, and the interposition of needless and burden some formalities, in the prosecution of a just claim for a pension. So far are all such representations from being correct, that I do not hesitate to say that any claimant of ordinary intelligence and edu cation can, on applying directly to this office for forms and instructions suited to the particular ease,-establish his claim, . and secure its prompt admission, without any other aid than that which will readily be given him by the magistrate before whom his declaration is to be executed. Nothing is required of the claimant which is not necessary, and, in most instances, conveniently attainable. ' " The applicant for an invalid pension, for example, if a private soldier, must (1) state, under oath, the company and regi ment in which he served, and the time, place and manner in which he incurred the disability on account of which he claims a pension ; also furnishing proof, by two witnesses, that the claimant is the identical person he represents himself to be. If the papers for his discharge have been made out as required by the army regulations, this, in most cases, is all that will be needed on his part to secure the allowance of a well-founded claim. The Certificate of his commanding officer and that of the Surgeon, who attended him, furnishing together the best evidence as to the nature, origin and degree of his disa bility, are transmitted to this office by the Adjutant-General, without any interven tion of the applicant. But if, for any rea son, these certificates are wanting or not satisfactory, then on a call from this office, the applicant must (2) furnish the certifi cate of some commissioned officer of his company, if possible, and if not, the affida vit of his non-commissioned officers or pri vates who were in service with him, con firming hisown allegations in regard to the time, place and manner of incurring his disability, showing the same to have been in the service of the United States, and in the line of duty ; and he must also be examined by a surgeon authorized to make such examination, as to the nature and degree of the disability, whose certifi cate will be transmitted to this office. Without this amount of proof it is clear that no claim can be properly admitted. Nor is there any difficulty in procuring such proof, in exact accordance with pre scribed forms, if the case is a just and hon est one. " So, too, of a widow's application for pen sion. A declaration setting forth the ser vice of her deceased husband, and other requisite facts within her own immediate knowledge, as specified in the printed instructions, has only to be accompanied by proof of her identity, of her marriage and of the death of her husband by reason of some injury or disease resulting from his service, and incurred in the line of duty, to secure a favorable consideration of her claim. The time, place, and cause of the husband's death is usually shown by the record of the Adjutant-General's office, (and obtained without any instrumentality of the applicant,) leaving for her to prove merely, that she is the person she repre sents herself to be, and the fact of her marriage to the deceased." The Shooting Match in Germany. Letters from Frankfort contains copious particulars of a great German shooting match shortly to take place in that city, and at which four hundred rifle clubs and upwards of four thousand riflemen have already announced their intention to be prtBent. It is expected that six thousand marksmen will compete. Every rifle club sends some prise to be shot for; various other societies and corporations have con tributed gifts for the same purpose. It is said that the prises thus received or an nounced amount to five hundred. Among them are many rifles, double-barrelled fowling pieces, revolvers, hunting-knives, silver cups, gold watches, and objects of the most varied description. The city of Fiankfort gives a prize of one thousand seven hundred fllorins, (about 145.), an anonymous society has sent two thousand florins to be shot for in two prises, another nameless donor contributes a silver basin -containing twenty-five ducats; oil paintings by old masters, com plete sets of Goethe's works, choice wines and kirechwasser in casks and cases, eil-Ter-mounted yataghans, and a host of other articles, are among the contribu tions. The German residents in Amster dam have sent a costly silver table service to be shot for, and at Frankfort a number of ladies have formed a society, and have produced most magnifioent banner for the rifle club of that place. On the first instant, was published at Frankfort, the first number of the " Offi cial Festival Journal, for the Universal German RifleJFestival held at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in 1862.'.' Up to the first of July, three thousand five hundred Ger mans and six hundred and thirty-two Swiss had announced their intention of competing. The preparations are on an extensive scale. A vast temporary hall has been erected, capable of containing some five thousand persons, which will be used for meetings and oratory, judging from the fact that it is provided with a tribune for speakers and a table for re porters; also for dining, for it contains two hundred tables for twenty persons each. There is a kitchen two hundred feet long, ample cellerage and store-rooms. Extensive contracts have been made with the Frankfort tradesmen, and much eating and drinking seems to be reckoned upon. One brewery furnishes one thousand five hundred barrels of beer, and the trifling quantity of eighty-seven thousand bottles of wine is mentioned by the local journals as having been contracted for. Sharon Iron and Steel Works. The extensive Rolling Mill at Sharon, Pa., recently purchased by Coleman, West erman & Cc, was put into practical opera tion Monday last. They have already commenced the manufacture of bar and sheet iron, and in a few weeks expect to have their nail and spike department in full operation. In addition to these they will make railroad iron for coal banks, and in the Spring will enter upon the manu facture of steel springe and axles. The concern, when in full blast, will employ between three and four hundred hands, and will be one of the most extensive iron works in the western country. Success to the enterprise. Mahoning Register. The Ambulance Corps of General Banks' Expedition. To the Editoe of the New Yoke Tikes Sim : Permit me to correct a statement of your Washington correspondent upon the subject of ambulances for the expedi tion nnder Major General Banks. The corps when organized will consist ot 150 ambulances, 86 medical wagons, and from 800 to 1,000 men, with the necessary offi cers. It has been the practice for the men to leave their ranks to assist the wounded to the rear. In future this will be strictly forbidden. The ambulance corps will be on the field and in constant attendance, to remove the wounded and insure them im mediate aid. - Nov. 24. R. terrible Rebel Srasshter at An tie tarn. j An officer of the 15th Georgia regiment writes to the Savannah Republican a let ter, which shows that the slaughter of the rebels in the battle of Antietam has not been exaggerated, at least in regard to the regiments whose movements he witnessed. He says: J " The fifteenth were posted in a narrow path, washed out into a regular gully, and were fired into by the enemy from the front, rear and left flank. The men stood their ground nobly, returning the fire un til nearly two-thirds of their number lay dead or wounded in that lane. Out of two hundred and ten carried into the fight over one hundred and twenty-five were killed and wounded in less than twenty minutes. The slaughter mu horrible. When ordered to retreat I could scarcely extricate my self from the dead and wounded around me. A man could have walked from the head of our line to the foot on their bodies. The survivors of the regiment retreated very orderly back to where General Ander son's brigade rested. The brigade suffered terribly. James South Carolina Battalion was nearly annihilated. The 15th Geor gia lost nearly all their commissioned officers." At night only fifty-five men of the 15th remained fit for duty. They were over forty-eight hours without anything to eat or drink. How Floyd was Foiled. A Fort Delaware correspondenturnish es the Pittsburgh Dispatch with the follow ing little bit of history : , "A day or two since, I obtained some particulars in relation to Floyd's attempt ed shipment of heavy artillery from Pitts burgh, which, in the absence of individual names, might, nevertheless, be of some in terest. These pieces, ostensibly ordered for Ship Island, near New Orleans, were really intended for Fort Morgan, at the entrance of Mobile Bay. The platforms were constructed at Watervliet; but, as the en gineer foresaw treason in the Secretary of War,they were purposely made three inches too short, with other defects which render ed them useless for Fort Morgan, but quite suitable for a new work at the opening of New York harbor. Other platforms were then ordered. The glacis, or outside were prepared for their reception and Foit Mor gan was pushed to completion. Floyd had all things-ready for the great guns at Pitts burgh, when events were precipitated by the rash treason of South Carolinians, and the rebels lost both guns and platforms. Union Among Common Friends in Congress. j There never was a party that had so many reasons for and inducements to con cert of action as the party composed of the friends of the war and the General Admin istration. They have a country to serve and to save, and they have immense politi cal interests to rescue from injury and destruction. If they are not thoroughly united they lose both country and party, and give the advantage to partisans whose hopes are all concentrated in the separation ot the Union, and whose party is in active sympathy with the rebellion. The Union men in the comming short session of Con gress, as the representatives of the Union people, should conscientiously consider the relation to their vast constituency, and their duty in the premises. If they can move in serried columns, they may accomp lish much before the 4th of March, 1863; but if they are divided, fatal and irrepar able evils will ensue. The only basis of co operation is the policy of the President of theJUnited 8 tales in all its details. Those who oppose or embarrass that policy can of course be regarded as the epen adver saries of the Administration. There are decided majorities in both branches of Con gress in favor of this policy, and if these majorities can be vitalized and made to move in harmony, the happiest results will follow. Washington Chroniale. A Connecticut Secessionist Outdone. A secessionist, who lives between Shef field and Canovan, Connecticut, attempted to raise a flag, but a loyal neighbor was resolved that he should not Getting all ready for hoisting, he seized the rope and began to pull, but the patriot pulled also on the other rope.. The secessionist thought to tire the Union man out, and hung on; the neighbor sent for his supper and the seces sionist for his lunch. When the Union man called also for a buffalo skin for his bed over night, the secessionist gave in, bundled up his flag, and went home amid the cheers of a crowd. Ar. Y. Post, "Nothing to Take Back." An incident occurred on the occasion of the recent visit of Vallandigham to Mansfield which is worthy of being put on record. After the speeches had been made in the afternoon, three gentleman entered an omnibus, at one of the hotels, to ride to the railroad station, and seated in it was another gen tleman unknown to them. After these gentlemen were seated, one of them remark ed to another: "did you hear Vallandigham this afternoon 7" "iTo" replied the other, indignantly, "it would be more creditable tolisten to Jeff. DaviB himself than to that contemptible traitor Vallandentootin ham." Hen the Btanger started up and putting on a severe look, and an extra amovnt of dignity, said fiercely: "am Mr. Vallandigham!" "It don't make a bit of difference, nrmly replied the gentleman; " I have nothing to take back." This com pletely cowed the pint of butternuts, and he slunk into his seat, and remained en tirely dumb during the remainder of the Irip.Bucyrtu Journal. A Naval Curiosity. The New York Poet says: "Sometime since the Ensrlish naners ftnnnnn that - 'dashing steam yacht' was preparing for .1 a P: in t fall hnl . I . i . 1 . - . jrvA, u iuuuimicu lUtt L she ' would soon be heard from in Amer ica.' She was described as 'a splendid little craft, swift as a deer, and trim us a hunter.' There is now at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a vessel which is supposed to be the one alluded to. She is called the Ouchita, and was captured in trying to run the blockade. She is a beautiful model of na val architecture, and will make a service able companion for the diminutive man-of-war America, another swift little craft, which has been seen in England at Cowes." The report of the Adjutant General will show that there are about 600,000 men in the field, and nearly 15,000 in hospitals. Operations of draft are not alluded to as very satisfactory.
