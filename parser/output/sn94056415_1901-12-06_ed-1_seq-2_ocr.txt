PROVES NO GENUINE COMET Director Campbell of Lick Observatory Explains Phenomenon SAN FRANCISCO Dec 2 Director Campbell of the Lick observatory has made a thorough search of the heav ens for the phenomenon witnessed at Chicago a few nights since Prof Campbell failed to find the slightest trace of a comet He explains the phenomenon witnessed in Chicago in two ways saying What the people saw may have been the bright trail left by a me teor I myself have watched such trails for as much as twenty minutes before they wholly disappeared It is more probable though that what they saw was the constellation known as the Pleiades It so happens that the Pleiades are now in exactly the loca tion in the heavens described in the dispatches and when obscured by a thin mist the constellation looks so much like a comet that it has been mistaken for it before DEPARTMENTS MERGED General Wade Xow Commands Northern and Southern Luzon MANILA Dec 2 The military de partments of northern and southern

his order machine and ground out some orders for the Nebraska National guard He authorized the organization of two new independent companies one at West Point and the other at Stanton James C Elliott was given authority to organize a company at West Point and G A Eberly of Stanton was giv en permission to recruit another at his home town Both companies will be equipped by the state and after organization may be admitted to the guard Orders were also issued for the for mation of a signal corps and en gineers corps at Fremont and two ad ditional sections of artillery the latter probably at Plattsmouth and Grand Island though the location is still un determined This activity in the Nebraska Na tional guard has caused many to be lieve that a third regiment is to be organized but General Colby says there is no ground for that belief as the independent companies do not in dicate a new regiment He says the matter of organizing a third regiment is undetermined The formation of two additional sec tions of artillery will necessitate more guns as each section is supposed to have two guns General Colby has taken steps to secure four new model breech loading cannon together with harness and equipment MANY WANT BOOKS TO READ Applications Are Received Daily by State Library Commission LINCOLN Neb Dec 2 Applica tions for sets of books are being re ceived by the State Library
