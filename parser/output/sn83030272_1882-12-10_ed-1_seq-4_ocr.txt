of I Bunday n a veritable Sabbath In NeI York f will not succeed In their purpose but only help to make the Sunday laws moro odious and to brIng them Into cieatcr contempt All attempts to compel the t teat ment of tho I frat Ilay of the week n anything moro than I I a day of rest will certainly fall of theIr ob ject and I ought to fall Tho majority of tho pcoplo will not con ecnt under a Government which depends upon tholr will to adopt tho Sabbatarian notions which tho old Puritans with the bigotry clmiactcilstlc of their day forced on Now England society The Putitans act up I tho Massachusetts colony for Instance nothing less than a theocracy based not I upon Chilstlanlty nnd savoiiiig little of itfi I Bplrlt but upon the Old Testament chang ing only tho day to bo observed as a fast I with Jewish strictness from the seventh to I the first Prom sundown on Saturday night t sundown on Sunday they icqulred with a bitter intolerance a general antl uniform ob FCaflco of the day they held sacred But even in New England society bioko away from tho artlllclal and wearisome icstialnts they Imposed and one of tho consequences of their bigotry was tho infidelity which BubRcqucntly appeared there In rebelling against their theocratleal views men ic bled against all religion also Besides hypocrisy was encouraged For their busi ness 01 social advantage men pretended 1 conformity they did not practise and pro fessed a belief they icjcctcd In their hearts And hypocrisy is the meanest of Ices Yet there are some narrow minds in New Jloik who btlll think it Is posslblo to compel A million ami 1 half of pcopls to bjjdgc their plcasuie chango the management of their private affairs and legulato theIr whole conduct on tho Hist day of the week In exccoidanco with notions which mo not com

thoso who would force the obsTrv anoo of Sunday ts 0 fast day They do not belIeve that tho Btnto has any light to Interfero with them on I that day moro than any other Provided they rare orderly and peaceable I must bo remembered that tho majority of tho population of New York aro not churchgoers At least they do not go to church regularly Sunday And of tho re mainder thoso who tako the PurItan view or Bunday arc a veiyemall minority Tie vast body of Roman Catholics havo different Ideas regarding Sunday Then there are tho r r lows who do not feel any religious obliga tion whatever to obscivo tho frt day of tho week and who claim tho right to work or play Sunday as they think best And of churchgoing Christians besides the Catho i lics thcro are many thousands who mako of Sunday a day both of religious observances 1 and of pleasure t Though so small a portion of tho commu nity tho Sabbatailans wish to mako tho Whole population of New Yoik keep tho first day of tho week to suit their notions and they want tho law to help them do It I I their theory is carried l out in its complete I ness every sort of business except that of the apothecaries and tho undertakers would havo to bo stopped on Sunday AVo could havo no Sunday papers and no Monday pa I jf pers for thoso must be prepared on Sunday No public pleosuies would bo allowed and tho population would bo bunk in gloom which a would of course ho relieved by an enormous 4 amount of secret ices We arc glad thereforeto hear that many of the clergymen of the city are sensible enough 1 sco that it Is I unwise to attempt to force A Bueli a Sunday on us and that tho effort will t tx > as futile as it is I foolish Tho peoplo welcome Sunday as a day of rest nod they wish the law to treat It as 4 that But how they shall rest all how 2 much they shall ret on Sunday they de ti mand the right to settle for UiemMlv Nor 1 will they tolerate tlio treatment of Sunday L 4 toy the State as a purely and peculiarly sacred tf day for the State has nothing to do with ic llglon That is I a matter for the IndivIdual citi i1 zen Legally Sunday can bo only a weekly holiday on which special precautions for 1 preserving order aro doubtless necessary L enforced however not because of the sacred Lv character of tho day In tho eyes of the State but because people aro moro likely to get Into mischief when they aro at lest than when they are

EVAIITS will outdo wi himself The Vatican ali Trance Few observers of tho Papal policy can all t have been struck by the divergence between thc Indexible attitude maintained LEO XIII tho Italian by XII toward Ialan monarchy and his conciliatory not to say Indulgent treatment the French republic Somo of the motives of this inconsistent behavior arc obvious enough but others of a moro subtle and farrccehlug character arc suggested in n recent number of tho Revue dttt Diux Monties Tho wrIters views aro tho moio remarkable because they coincide with opin Ions put forth some ten yearn ago by Mr ST Uionau MrvAivr who wo scarcely need to bay Is at once a distinguished scientist an a sincere Catholic I Is hardly possible to exaggerate the contrast presented by tho conduct of tho Vatican toward Franco on the ono hand and Italy on the other Notwithstanding tho so called March decrees which were rigorously enforced against tho quiet Trapplst and tho liberal Dominican as well as against tho busy Jesuit notwithstanding the Catholic establishment In France has seen itself sue c 0sivejtv threatened In It schools In tho means O reC tilling the priesthood and In the meagic stipends contributed by Iho State for its biippoit Iho zettiote Qf the Ultra montane faction have called in vain upon tht ontlff lo launch tho thunders of escom nunlcallon against tho French persecutors of the Church Leo XIII would not even yIeld to them so far a to withdraw from Paris his diplomatic representatIve While tim Italian kingdom left unfilled 1 tho post of Ambassador to FrAnce the Vicar of JURIST still remained ofllclal relations with ho Trench republic and tho Papal Nuncio a tho dean of the diplomatic body con tinues every year to offer President 

GRLVT ho good wishes of the European powers But while tho Pope has given Franco such llroof8 > of 1 longsuffering and placable dls position ho has maintained toward tim Ital Ian Government an austere reserve accept lug nothing proposing nothing showing himself in fact with a lllllo moro selfre straint of demeanor no less inflexible of pur pose than was his predecessor And this to award a country In which a policy of com promise and reconciliation would bo most cordially welcomed on tho part of tho civil authorities and tho mass of the citizens Why Is It that LEO XIII shows himself so genial and so tractable outside of tho Italian Peninsula and so Intractable at home Ono reason is obvious enough because namely tho consolidated monarchy of Italy was con structed at tho expenso of tho States of tho I Church and therefore tho Pop who man ages to live at peace with republics tho most I opposed lto clericalism cannot bring himself to accept any Kind ot compromise with I Installed in tho tho spollatho dynasty Instlo i palace of tho Quliiual Tho plan of Leo XIII seems to have been to make as many friends or allies a possi ble among tho other European Governments in order to press on Italy with the wholo eight of Christendom Among all the diffi culties in which tho Roman Church Ilnds itself Involved tho vital question for the Vatican Is that which Is concerned with Its dwelling place and Us domestic life In Germany in France In SwiUeilaud in Bel gium or In Poland It Is only a section or member of tho Church which Is attacked In ole on the contrary It Is tho Papacy itself the head and heart of Christendom whoso ant existence is Imperilled There is however according t tho lleruc des Deux Mondee another reason for tho specially indulgent treatment of Franco by the Vatican The patience and long suffer ing exhibited by LEO XIII in his dealings with the French republic Is not attrIbute by the French writer to hypoerlllcal tactics Inspired by tho necessities of tho moment Ho would explain It rather on this ground that before the swiftly rising tIde of de mocracy the Papacy is 1 unwilling to connect It cause Indissolubly with that of monarchy Since 1870 at all events the Holy See Is much less Intel esteU than It once was In the maln lenanco of thrones Since Iho loss of Us tern poial power there Is somo reason to suspect that the Vatican lows the advent of republi can Institutions with much less consternation than is ascribed loll In thc thln usually a cllbcd I pros pects which terrify conservative pollllcians It may not improl ably recognIze chances of a now ole and opportunities of ichablllta ton for tho Church I thus far tho Holy Seo has refrained from publicly expressing wish for the downfall of Iho monarchical principle this may bo explicable by Iho fact that tho Papacy has not yet quite despaired of resuming It place among the Kings of this world I still reckons on them to aid It sooner or later in the restoration of Its temporal dominion But when it shall loso all faith In tho support once looked for from crowned heads the Papacy uccoidlug t the Revue will not iong hesitate to detach its cause from theIrs and to enter upon other paths of policy Lot tho Vatican bo once peisuadcd that moonarchlcal power can novel bo resuscitated for the suc cessor of St Pirrrn and It may easily resign Itself to sco It collapse all over tho wot Id and
