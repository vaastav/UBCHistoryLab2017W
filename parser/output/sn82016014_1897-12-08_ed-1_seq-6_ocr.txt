ROGUS CITIZENS COME IN. Fraudulent Naturalization Papers Is sued to Italian Immigrants. New York, Dec. S. Commissioner of Im migration Fitchey has been notified by Commissioner General Powderly that the state department at Washington has been informed by the United States ambassa dor at Rome that a wholesale traffic in fraudulent naturalization papers is being carried on in Italy. The object of these fraudulent methods, Mr. Powderly said, is to effect the entry into the United States under cloak of American citizen ship of aliens who otherwise would be subject to exclusion. In view of these facts Commissioner Fitchey is ordered to particularly investigate all naturalization papers of immigrants, and especially those from Italy. Commissioner Fitchey said that the task was an extremely difficult one. He said that from the large number of immi grants recently landed he believed that there were agents in Europe who, in fur therance of this fraudulent scheme, had secured steerage passengers under the threat that unless they came at once they would not be admitted at all, as con gress was about to pass a restricting law.

Grant and other gentlemen comprising a com mittee of the chamber of commerce, have applied to the city council for a railway franchise in this city on a par allel with the franchise of the Santa Fe company. The petitioners agree to be gin construction work by January 1, U99, and to operate the road by Janu ary 1. 1900. A. E. Nutt, the secretary of the com mittee thus explains the application: "The committee," said Mr. Nutt. "has received encouragement that a railroad running from here to the Colorado riv er can be built and the parties who would take hold of the matter first re quire that a franchise be secured through the city. If the council will grant the franchise under the condi tions asked for that will clear any de lay on that account and may possibly result in the line being built. On the other hand, should some other bona fide proposition come up whereby a railroad giving us an eastern outlet can be built, then the committee will turn over the franchise granted them through the city." High Grade Work Get our Prices on Family Washing. TOPEKA STEAM LAUNDRY. Contracts involving the expenditure of $120,000 during the ensuing six months, for supplies at the various state institutions, are being considered today at the National hotel, by the state board of charities and the direc tors of the state Soldiers' home at Dodge City. Of this amount, $100,000 is expended by the board of charities, and $20,000 by the Soldiers' home directors. The hotel is the busiest place in town. The members of the board of charities jjccupy the parlors while the Soldiers' home directors have two sample rooms on the lower floor. The lobby is occupied by representa tives of the various firms in competi tion and the halls and stairways are active as they move anxiously between the two rooms where the bids are being considered. In the rear parlor at the hotel is an immense displayif dry goods, clothing and similar articles of merchandise. On the basement floor are shown stacks of baking powders, coffees, teas, spices, cheese, hams, side meat, beans, Hour, meal, in fact everything needed to eat and wear by the people .who are the wards of the state. These contracts are awarded, semi annually, in December and June. The occasion always brings forth a large amount of lively competition and 57 firms are represented at this time. Chairman W. L. Brown, of the board of charities, said today: "The competition is very active and It is my opinion that we will be able to secure the advantages of low bid ding and first-class goods. The firms which are bidding are among the best in the business and their commercial standing insures carrying out of the contracts which we will make." Frank Shane, a member of the board said: "The bidding is such that the board is of the opinion that we will be able to get bedrock prices on everything we buy. We have not had time to make a close examination of the various bids but from a limited observation which has been made I am sure we will be able to get lower prices than ever be fore." The secretary of the board, S. C. Wheeler, assisted by the other members makes a schedule of all bids received. Across the top of a huge sheet of paper appears a list of all the articles upon which the bids are asked. Under the names of these are columns for the amounts bid. Down the left hand col umn appear the names of the bidders. When a bid is being considered an ex amination of the figures in the column under the name of the article in ques tion makes it very easy to determine the lowest price. From these figures, following the column to the left hand margin, is shown the name of the bid der. This system of managing the bids makes an immense amount of work a simple matter. These schedules were completed this morning and the members of the two boards took up the consideration of the bids. The first work was an examina tion of the samples shown. This aft ernoon the work of awarding contracts is likely to begin, although it may not be reached until tomorrow.

M'NALL CONTEMPT CASE. Judge Fo3ta.- Takes it Under Advise ment Will Decide Saturday. Judge C. G. Foster has taken the Mc Nall contempt case under advisement and will announce his decision Saturday morning. "At that time," said Judge Foster today, "attorneys will be present in court ready for trial of the case, should the decision sustain the indictment." The hearing of the case was had today, commencing at 10 o'clock, in the federal court. It was concluded before noon. This is the case in which Mr. MoNall was cited to appear in court to answer to an indictment charging him with ob structing the court in its trial of the Hill mon cases and interfering with the ad ministration of justice in his action against the New York life companies, re turned by the federal grand jury last summer. Attorney General Boyle, on behalf of Mr. McNall, today submitted a motion to quash the indictment. He argued that the defendant had not, in any case, in terfered with the court or the business of the company, as they had no legal right to do business in this ttute. "In terference with the court must mean a conilict with something which the court has done," said Mr. Boyle. "In this case we have nothing of this kind. The court had not acted in any manner upon th se cases. The companies had no licenses to do business in Kansas and the defendant at no time indulged in any action which could be construed as an attempt to in terfere with the administration of justice or the process of this court." I. E. Lambert, United States attorney, followed Mr. Boyle and stated that the plaintiff was prepared to show that these companies were entitled to licenses to do business in Kansas and that they had complied with every demand of the law and further to show that Mr. McNall had taken the unlawful action with which he was charged. Mr. Overmyer, on behalf " of the de fendant,' followed Mr. Lambert and stat ed that McNall's action was not contempt in the sense that the indictment indicat ed. Mr. Overmyer added that McNall had taken no action and that his conduct, of which the indictment complained, vaa an occasional hint or interview concern ing what he proposed to do, yet he had in reality done nothing. This concluded the hearing and court was adjourned for the noon hour. NOW FOR
