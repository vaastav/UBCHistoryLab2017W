GULLIBLE MILLIONAIRES. Every time Congress takes up th?? question of a change, ??ltIi*t upward or downward, of the tariff schedules, the louJeat cry for free entry of cer tain specified articles invariably comes from the persons who aie best equipped tUDI lully to i>ay auy amount of duty upon the rommodl*. tics they wl?h lo bring here from Europe. I'pon the plea that the American, artistic temperament should be whole. Nomely developed, the Ogden Goeleta, the J, Plerpont Morgans, the Mrs. Jack Gardners and other in :e or less pretentious new riches always have contended that the purchasers abroad, of Old Masters should be permitted! to bring the canvases into this coun? try without paying tribute at the cus? tom house. True, these works of art are hung in private galleries and tbe part of the American public which the owners contend is most in need of en? lightenment along artistic lines, is not permitted to gaze upon these marvels of the painter's brush at'or they get here. Hut the rabble may lead about them In the Sunday newspapers and be up? lifted. Recently, however, it has developed that the commercial ability which en. aides one to accumulate millions In soap, starch or p>rk may yet leave him shy of discriminating Judgment when It comes to the identification of >al Old Mastern. The realization of this fact has pro? duced a sort of protective union amongst the parvenuea of Plttsburg, an account of which Is given below: "A general overhauling of picture galleries of Plttsburg rich men la now On to see how many of their paint? ings are Spurious.

This list is said to contain the names of more than l score of New York dealers, and ful? ly as many in London and Paris. "Within the past vear a prominent Pittshurger arranged to buy a pictur? abroad for $25.000. but found before delivery that this work of "an old master" had been made in New York and shipped abroad for his benefit." An ungifted New York knight of the brush, without the ability to pro? duce an acceptable American maga? zine cover design, may execute a daub, label it "Rembrandt" or "Raphael,' send it to Europe end receive a fabu? lous sum from our millionaire con uoisseurs when they travel abroad In search of masterpieces.

The Investigation has not!

As to] Companies (' and D. there can be no question that practically every man In (hem must have had knowledge that the shot ting was dune by some DE the soldiers of B troop, and pos? sibly by one or two others in one ot the other troops. This conceal-j ment was itself a grave offense, which ?as greatly aggravate!'by their test!-, lying before the Senate committee thai they were Ignorant of what they? must have knowu. Nevertheless, it is to be raid In partial extenuation' that they were probably cowed by; threats, made by the more desperate' of the men who had actually been I engaged in the shooting, as to what would happen to any man who fatted to protect the wrongdoers. More over, there are circumstances tending j to show that these misguided men were encouraged by outsiaers to per-j sis* In their course of concealment' and denial .1 feel, therefore, thai the guilt of the men who. after the event, thus shielded the perpetrators of the wrong by refusing t tell the truth about them, though serious, was in part due to the unwise and impro? per attitude of others, and that some1 measure of allowance should be mail.-! for the misconduct. In other words,' I believe we can afford to reinstate any of these men mh<> truthfully tell what has happened, give all the aid, they can to tlx the responsibility ui>on those who are really guilty, and show that they themselves had no guilty knowltdce beforehand and wete in no way implicated in the af? fair, rave by having knowledge of I' afterwards and failing and' refusing to divulge It I'ndt-r ^he circum? stances, and in view of the length or time they have been out of the ser-' vice, and their loss of the hcnt-fl> ?1 would have arcured to them by con? tinuous long-time service, we can af? ford to treat the men who meet the( requirements given shove a.- having been sufficiently punished by the con? sequent es they brought upon them relves ehen they rendered n?-cessary the rxcrctoe of the disciplinary power.1 I recommend that a Ian be pa-sed allowing the secre'ary of war. within S Overt p.-ri?d of time, siy a year, to r-irs'at.- any of these soldiers whom he .tfter a careful examination finds to hue b?-cn innocent and ?hetn "e finds to have done aii in his po*rr to hel^ bring to ju.-tice the snill'y. j "Veanwhile the in vest iga* Ion will be ron'inn? d The rr?ul s have made it obvious 'hat onlv by carrying on ihe Invent igst ion as the war depart? ment has actually carried it on ts there the slightest chance of bringing the cffen.lers to Justice or of (?.?para Ing not the innocent, for there were doubtless hardL an\ innocent, but in* lsns guilty from those artosc gall' was heinous THEOIORF.
