"We take the following from tho Washington correspondent of thc New York Herald, of the ll th instant: rSTKKVlKW JJfiTWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND SENATOIi SUMNER. A rich interview took place between the President und Senator Sumner, on the evening after the message was read in Congress. It Listed for several hours. There wore three or four persons present. Sumner is represented aa having beer, very nervous. Some of those present thought he would go in:?) ti lit ?it two or tlave different periods <-f thc consultation. At any rate, his actions justified thc application of the term of being a monomaniac in regard to the negro. Finding himself unable to move the President, he finally broke out ?is follows : "Mr. President, I notice that the white rebels down itt Alabama and other localities in the South, are talk? ing very strong against the Union, and denouncing it in strong terms; can von not do something to put .> atop "to it?" Th-.- President coolly replied : "I set?, Air. Sunnier, that tito white rebels in iSostoi; are bilking against the fjuiojs. Can't, you put a slop to it there?" This coufuscil tho Senator for a shorl time, but after twisting in his sent for a short time, he again broke ont. ?xs follows : "Mr. Johnson, the reports from thc South show that tuc white rebels in almost every section are insulting the freedmen. .Don't you think thal Congress ought to do something to corroe! this evil ?" The President, with a significant wink nt the other gentlemen p- ?eut, repli, il : "Mr. Sumner, i notice by the papers that tho white rebels in Cincinnati have berni, recently insult? ing whit? people there and knocking down ?ne or two. Can't Congress do something to correct that evil ?" lt is needless to add that the stay of th s Maisavcausetts negro monoma ni ie ?it the White House wiis of short duration after that thrust. ? cow:-:;: in::.:> nv TKK r*T-.V_-;iX>iJNT. Member:; of Congress have all of a sudden discovered that the President has the appointing power in his hands. They see that, with very fev. exceptions, th' federal offiee-liolders throughout the country, from the Cabine'., down, are those appointed under President Lincoln's adminis? tration. Already there is a wonder? ful uneasiness among the members of the House who voted for Stevens' resolution. This fear will cause a gre it chance iii that body. The p.ibliu maj look for some grand politic,i! somersaults before the ses sion termin?tes. In order that this .point may bo understood I give the points of conversation which took place a day or two since between a high official und a republican member. The member referred to was boasting how he was going to oppose the President's policy, and that he did not care what Mr. Johnson did. "Stop," says the official, "aro you sure you are independent of the President, and eau sustain yourself at i home if you oppose him ? Your dis : triet is very close." ! "What has the President to do : with my district ? The people elect ; ed me, and expect me to carry out I their views. I represent them, not I the President, and he can't affect me i there." "But," adds tho official, "how many postmasters have you in your district ?" "That has nothing to do with it," replied tho member, "they are all friends of mine. Besides, it is al? ways understood that the lieprescnta i tive in Congress is entitled to those j appointments for his friends." "But," replied the official, "sup . pose that the President should take it into his head to remove all of youi I friends and appoint men in theil ! place who were friends of his and did i not care anything about you, what I then would bo your position al : home ?" j This opened the matter in a new I light to the enthusiastic member j After a little hesitation he asked in ? j tone showing that this was a nev ! phase to the question, "The Presi I dent will not think of doing th.-t, tvil ; he ?" "I don't know," replies the official "what the President will do, o: whether he hus thought of thi: matter. I only know what I woul< do ii I were in his place, and thu would ba to remove every one of you friends if you opposed the policy o my administration." "W-e-U-well," drawled out tin member, "I don't know but tb President's policy is right, after all and I thinlc T will support bim."
