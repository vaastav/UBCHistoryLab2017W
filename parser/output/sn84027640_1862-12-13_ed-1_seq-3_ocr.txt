Without 4cr slavery the rebellion would never have exieteJ. Without slavery it could not s continue. Among the friends of the Un ion there i3 great diversity of sentiment . and policy in regard to slavery and the 'African race amongst us. Some would abol ishfit suddenly and without compensa tion ; some would remove the free people fronius, and some would retain them with us ; and there are yet other minor diversi- 3& ies.i" Because of these diversities, we waste mut.h strength in struggles amongst P ourselves. I3y mutual concession we could harmonize and "act together. This would be a compromise among the friends, and not with the enemies of the Union. The articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concession. If the plan shall ' rhe adopted, it is assumed that emancipa- l k tion will follow at least in several of the States. (Concluded next week.) s- President's Message. To the exclu sion of news and editorial matter we pub- lish to-day the larger and most important 'portion of the President's annual message. It is a plain, straightforward document, such as we might expect from our Honest . and worthy Executive. Interesting and impsrtanc as these state papers always are, oAhould be, in times of peace and pros perity, it should in this the country's darkest hour merit the attention of every patriot and well wisher of his country. t" ' We learn that on last Friday night, T Wek, .the wheat stacks of Wm. Thomp son and A. J. Palmer, twelve.miles below ".hereon the Blue, were burned, supposed ,.vLJy. an incendiary. The stacks were the result or growth of eighteen acres, and rprobably contained some three hundred bushels of wheat.
