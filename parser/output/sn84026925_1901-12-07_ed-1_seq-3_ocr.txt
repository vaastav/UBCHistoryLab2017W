Speaking to the reporter about the Amos Owens cherry tree scheme, a few days ago, a gentleman said: "A young lady in my neighborhood received a letter from a friend about the cherry tree scheme and forwarded her mon ey. Within a few days she received copies of letters she must write, and one of them made her say that she had already been in the employ of the company for three months, and that she had been receiving: her pay regu-1 larly. She was not willing to send out a letter like that, and so she wrote to I the cherry tree people asking them to return her money. They did not return it. however. Dropped Dead at Hia Post. Mr. M. W. Bissell, of Camden, who was serving as station agent at Sha-I ron, for the South Carolina and Georgia Extension railroad, died suddenly last Tuesday afternoon. He had been in bad health for quite awhile, suffering from heart disease and a kidney trouble; but was feeling no worse than usual during the day. After the passage of the train, he made his report as usual, and in a few moments began to complain of a violent cramp. His little daughter, aged 7, and Master Campbell Caldwell were in the office with him, and he asked young Caldwell to telephone for Dr. J. H. Saye. Just as the doctor was called, Mr. Bissell fell off his chair, and when the doctor arrived, three or four minutes afterward, he was dead. Mr. Bissell was aged about 55 or 60 years, and had been at Sharon only for about two weeks as substitute ior air. jbvi/?...v., the regular agent, who was off on a short vacation. The body of the deceased was taken to Camden on Wednesday morning. How to Find Things. In the last issue of The Enquirer, there appeared two advertisements for lost articles. In one case it was a Smith & Wesson revolver, and in the other, it was a double barrel breechloading shot gun. The pistol had been lost by Mr. C." F. Gordon, on the Clyburn-Heath livery stable premises. During Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Gordon received a telephone message from Mr. Haskell Thomasson, of Zadok, stating that Mr. Thomasson had found the revolver advertised and that he would be pleased to return it During Thursday afternoon, Mr. J. C. Dickson brought in information about the gun. He said it had been found on the King's Mountain road, about two miles north of Yorkvllle, on Monday night, by Messrs. Wallace and Clinton. Although it was supposed that the gun had been lost In Yorkville, from the known circumstances, it is practically certain that the one found by the gentlemen mentioned, is the one advertised for. Smallpox at Gaitonla. Mr. Nell is getting along well. He Is not confined to his room. There are four colored people that have the disease. There are several colored suspects. They will be released next week. Tomorrow is the limit of voluntary vaccination. The town will enforce the ordinance for compulsory vaccination. A large number of Negroes are being vaccinated, but not so many white people. Most of the people on Main street are being vaccina ted. A Negro m &oum romi uaa mc smallpox. The disease is thought to come to this county from York county. There is no more danger in coming to Gastonia or no more danger from a citizen of Gastonia than anybody anywhere else. The truth is the disease is scattered all over the country and there is no safety from the disease unless it be in vaccination. The disease, however, is mild. Some are leaving town rather than submit to vaccination. The anti-vaccination preachers are getting in their best work now and the man who can tell the most frightful story takes the cake. Charged With Arson. Gastonia News: Jos. A. Pasour was placed in jail here on Thanksgiving day, friendless and penniless. He is charged with piling fodder under Joe Mayes distillery, near Cherryvllle and with pistol in hand, forcing his wife to set fire to the kindling. Pasour is a noted distiller and well known character in this section. He began life in poverty, but by distilling and thrift he accumulated a large amount of property. He was known several years ago to have as much as $7,000 in cash in his safe at a time, of his own money. He built a large brick residence two miles east of Cherryville and furnished it with fine carpets, furniture, silverware, etc. But now his property is all gone except some that is in the hands of his wife, and she is not disposed to help him. Reel Black was formerly his friend, but not so now. His bond is fixed at $500 and it is not probable that he will be able to give it. He is a rather heavy built man of 45 years. He has a full set of black beard, just beginning to turn gray. He has the appearance of a man of intelligence and affairs. He doesn't look like a jail bird. County Commissioners. The county board of commissioners held their regular monthly meeting in the office of the supervisor on Wednesday. all of the members oeing present. The business was of a routine nature and was devoid of particular interest. During the day, Supervisor Gordon made a suggestion to the effect that it would probably be a very good idea to do away with the present system of building bridges by contract, and instead to train a special convict foive for such work. Under the direction of an experienced bridge builder, the supervisor thinks that such an arrangement could be managed so as to secure satisfactory and economical results. The other members of the board were disposed to approve Mr. Gordon's idea: but no definite action was taken. During the discussion, it developed that in various neighborhoods there are a number of individuals who make it a business to encourage the building of bridges so as to get the contracts for themselves. It was suggested that one tendency of such a condition would be the construction of unnecessary bridges, and there was also an expression to the effect that in spite of the most careful supervision of the commissioners, it is often exceedingly difficult to get full value for the money paid out under the contract system. The principal concern of the board Is to avoid the building of unnecessary bridges, and to ensure greater durability and economy in the construction of such bridges as are actually necessary. 

SOUTH CAROLINA NEWS. The Jury Lair. Columbia State, Thursday: Mr. J. iv. Henry, solicitor of the Sixth circuit, is here to represent the state in the effort to test the constitutionality of the jury laws. At Gaffney, last fall, the issue was raised by Senator Graydon, who represented one Wilson, who was being tried for murder. Judge Gary declared , the law unconstitutional and an appeal has been made. The alleged unconstitutionality lies in the fact that special provisions are made for several counties, and this is said to be special legislation. Solicitor Henry stated yesterday that he had at first taken hold of the case rather fearfully, but the ! more he has studied it, the more satis- 1 fled has he become that the law is constitutional. He was the solicitor at Gaffney. The appeal to the supreme court is not made in the Wilson case; but in a riot case from the same county. j Expense of the Government Exhibit ! Washington special of Wednesday to The News and Courier: Today, at . the instance of Senator Tillman, the senate passed the Elliott joint resolution admitting the foreign exhibit dis- m played at the Buffalo exposition to be i transferred to Charleston duty free. i The resolution was so carefully drawn 1 that it did not provoke a word of crit- 4 icism in either branch of congress, and it will become law as soon as President Roosevelt signs it. This is the resolution Senator McLaurin had prepared; but he gave way to Col. Elliott r and Senator Tillman, who were the originators of neany all of the exposition legislation proposed during the last congress. Senator Tillman also accomplished something more substantial in behalf of the exposition before the day's session closed. With a view to assisting in carrying out the recommendations, of the president favoring an appropriation to defra,y the expense of the government exhibit, the senator secured the passage of a resolution calling upon the secretary of the treasury for an estimate of the amount needed. This is in line wiih the bill introduced by Senator Tillman last winter, which died in the last hour of the session. The senator proposes to introduce his bill, leaving the amount to be appropriated blank, and subsequently filled in after the es- ^ timate from the treasurey department is received. The South Carolina delegation is confident that the friendly feeling exhibited by the president and both houses of congress insures the imjnediate passage of the bill. Sena- c tor Tillman also introduced bills to settle the claims of South Carolina against the United States government growing out of the Revolutionary war: to correct the military record of David J. Jones, and for a public build Ing at Georgetown, S. C. j

The town of Elizabeth City, N. C., is very much stirred up on account of ( the mysterious disappearance of Miss i Ella Cropsey, on November 20, last, j When last seen Miss Cropsey was with c her lover, James Wilcox, who had been j paying her attention for two years or t more. Members of the family say that \ Miss Cropsey went out on the porch p for a private talk with Wilcox. They j heard noise of a struggle; but did not j think much of it until next morning. 1" when Miss Cropsey was missed. Wilcox denies all knowledge of the whereabouts of the young lady. People believe that Wilcox murdered Miss Crop- t sey and threw her body in the river. r The river has been dragged without ef- I feet. Wilcox was arrested on Tuesday r and held on a bond of $1,000. The * whole country is becoming stirred over the mystery. AT THE
