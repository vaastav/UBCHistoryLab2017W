The Century Introduces itself with the light-hearted "L Allegro" of Milton, accom panied by three fine Illustrations in color, the most advanced specimens of litho graphic art. Next comes "Christmas in France," where the Christ child officiates in the bestowal of gifts instead of our Txrhlte-bearded Santa Claus. "The Settle ment of the West," by Emerson Hough, 13 continued, also the dramatic sketch ''Bar barossa.' by Brady. "The Appeal of the Hook Plate" commends Itself to book lov ers who loan books and also to thoe who borrow them, as the book plate may serve as a protection to the owner through its appeal to the often slumbering conscience of the borrower. Uy all raeans let the book Plate, no matter what its device, be re vived and scattered abroad. The first pa per of "Thackeray in the United States." by Grant Wilson, Is full of pleasant rem iniscences of the famous and much loved author. "Impressions of President Mc Kinley, with Special Reference to Ills Opinions on Reciprocity," also "The Pcr fonality of President Roosevelt" are of wide Interest. "Policeman Fiynn's Ad ventures," by Klllott Flower, contains good advice as to the practice of economy and "jrood sense" in buying Christmas pres ents and also some hints In "diplomacy." 'Ulaeksum Ag'lrT Thunder." by Stockton. end "The Testimonial." by Gelett Burges". are contributions from the humorists and are In fact humorous. The fiction is Rood, the bst story N?ins "The Mystery Play." by Elizabeth Cherry Waltz. The poetry Is also to be commended, both the serious and that "in lighter v.. ." In Its mechanical and artistic features the Christmas number of Harper's Maga zine is a delight to the eye. The simplicity of Its cover-an imitation of brown leather, with gilt lettering first makes it distinc tive, while within the illustrations and typography are all that could be desired. A short story by Maurice Hewlett, which opens the number, has several illustrations in color by Albert Sterner, printed on parchment paper. This story, which is of the same rivrioti as the author's "Richard U WW IF YOU AltU A

If all historical tales were of equally high grade they would be less of a weariness to the soul. Admirable illustrations in color by Smedley accompany a Bret Harte "Colonel Starbottle" story. Among the no ticeable reproductions, in black and white are those representing a number of stud ies by Rosa Bonheur. Many of the sketches and stories have to do with chil dren, as Is in keeping with the holiday season. Even Mark Twain has a child for hi3 chief character in his story of the days of Cromwell; Bret Harte's "Colonel Star bottle" concerns himself with the affairs of a little girl. Sarah Orne Jewett's "Honey Tree," or, as it would be known in the "West, "bee tree," was discovered by a boy, who expected to profit greatly by the hid den treasure. Bishop Potter writes thought fully of "Mother and Child." and E. C. Martin of "Other People's Children." Sev eral poems have childhood for their them. Among contributions of a different charac ter are "New Light on Parthenon Sculp tures;" letters written by Mrs. Judith Page Rives, making up an article entitled "L Woman in the Paris Revolution of 1S30;" "A Fifteenth Century Revival." "In the World of the Azores," "The Stcry of the Snow Crystals," "New Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson." "Companoar, the Span ish Poet," "Rosa Bonheur an Apprecia tion." and "The Phoenix of the Aztecs." There is unusual variety in the content and a remarkable number of notable contri butions. Fiction Is the leading feature of Scrib ner and includes "The Making of a Pilot," by Albert White Vorse, an exciting and apparently true story, wherein the qualities necessary to the make-up of a pilot are ad mirably exhibited; "The Turquoise Cup," by Arthur Cosslett Smith, an entertaining tale where the principal characters are the Lady Nora, a lovely Irish girl, the Earl of Vauxhall, an Englishman, and their good friend, the cardinal, long years before a lover of Nora's grandmother; "The Last of the Fairy Wands." by Wil liam Henry Bishop; "The Fortunes of Oliver Horn," by F, Hopkinson Smith, con tinued from the November number, with the beginning of Oliver's love story; and "The Stranger Within Their Gates," by Eleanor Stuart. The last is humorous and is dramatically descriptive of the scenes which led to the confushn of Madame Le Bau, who aspired to be the autocrat of the town and, as such, to be the principal in the entertainment to be tendered by the townspeople to the noted actor who was expected "within thlr gates." Benjamin Paul Blood furnisl-' a line poem, styled "Thyreus," Ulustrat . by Andre Castaigne. Thyreus was sent by Octavius. after the sea tight before Actium, to win Cleopatra from Antony, and recounts In the poem his adventures. Other poems are "The Hidden Bird," by Josephine Peabody, and "Sea Fog," a sonnet. "American Por traiture of Children" argues the inability of artists who do not love children, and hence cannot enter into their feelings properly to produce them In portraits. Actual por traits of actual children by various ar- tists are reproduced as illustrations for the article. "When the Snow Falls in the Adi rondacks," by John It. Spears, is fine read ing for those who love the "beautiful snow," but gives the cold shivers to those who prefer to hear the raindrops fall and to Fee the bare, brown earth. The illus trations are from photographs, reproduced in tints, drawn by Jules Gueiin. Type, pa per, illustrations and make-up are, as usual, of the best.

HE FELL TO HIS DEATH T. II. IV ATI? IIS, A TRAVELING SALKS 3IAN, KILLI-: AT LAFAYETTE. Found Trlth .fck and Iloth Lee Ilroken on the Cement ewalk In Front of the Lahr House. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. LAFAYETTE, Ind., Dec. 8.-T. Ti. Wa ters, representing the N. D. Dodge & Bliss Shoe Manufacturing Company, of New buryport, Mass., and whose home is in Toledo, was killed at 8 o'clock this morn ing by falling from a third lloor window of the Lahr House to the cement side walk on the Fifth-street $dde. No one saw him fall, but the dead body was found a moment afterward, with the neck and both legs broken. He was about forty-eight years old, was well known to shoe mer chants here and had been making regular visits to the city for nearly fifteen years. There is no way of accounting for the death. In the room, next the window, was a sample table four feet wide, and it was necessary to cross this before he could fall. Friend3 with whom -he spent the evening until 10 o'clock say he was not drinking and that they can imagine no causa for suicide. At 10:30 he is reported as having said ho was not feeling well. He took a milk punch and soon after retired, but was restless during the night and once or twice called for a bell boy. The pre sumption is that, becoming delirious or seeking more air, he undertook to raise the window and fell to his death. He has a sister living In Delta, O., a suburi of Toledo, and she has been communicated with. Mr. Waters was a member of tho Knights Templars, and the order has taken temporary charge of the remains. . . NEW CLUII HOUSE FOR PL'RIll'E. Fund for Thl Purpose lins Ileen Started liy the Claas of 1003. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. LAFAYETTE, Ind., Dec. 8. Two of the greatest needs of Turdue University bid fair to be supplied in the very near future. The first, an assembly hall of adequate size, was recently made possible by Mrs. Eliza Fowler's magnificent gift of J60.0CO for thi3 purpose. The second, a clubhouse for the exclusive use of the members of the various athletic teams, and which has been for some time one of the fond dreams of the "Boiler Makers," will soon become a reality. The initiative was taken by the class of 1003 at a meeting held on Friday evening in the old chapel, when they pledged themselves to raise-$1.000 to be ap plied in the erection of the proposed club house. The other three classes are no less anxious to see the project carried out and will heartily takoa hand in raising the cost of the building, doubtless making gifts to their alma mater of a similar nature and purpose. In this clubhouse the players will live, enjoying comfortable rooms with all possi ble modern conveniences and the advantage of being near the university buildings, training quarters and the athletic field. It is proposed to set a good training table in the same building for the players. In short, every effort is to be made to afford Purdue teams of the future the best of advantages and care.
