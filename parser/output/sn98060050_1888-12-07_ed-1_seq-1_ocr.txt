Turning Ui the Bouth-westw-ethen followed tho couruo of the river, and a delightful day' ride it was which took us through the low lands of Canada along the shore of that heautiful sheet of water, lake Ontario, Here wo Raw many line farms hut the houteK, as a rule, were small and loor. One of the tnont iiuticeaMe features was the absence of stone Halts, which seem, indeed, to lie peculiar to New Knglaiid, for in Canada they are replaced hy rail fences, on the prairies hy Imrhed wire, and hero in Call forma hy hedges. Tho laud was almost entirely under cultivation, aud was heing pieparcd for wheat, though it was very wet, the water standing uxm portions of it. Kingston, Toronto and (iuelpli seemed large and thriving cities. Iteachiug Point Kdward. the St. Clair river was crossed hy Umt to Tort Huron. Shoutings for Harri son and nssurances that he was 'all right" awoke everyone from their slutnliershefore wo had heeu five minutes in Tort Huron, and left nodmiht that we wire once more in the Tinted Stales. Passing through IaJiiisinir, Mich., and Valparaiso, Iud , wo reached C'hicngo at ten o'clock Thursday morning. Thence w o pro ceeded hy way of Juliet mid IaSatle, III., to llock Island, where we crossed the Miss issippi liver nt HrivenNirt, la., at JJ.IW in the afternoon. Javeniort seemed to he n hcuutiful city. From tho cars we could look dou n the long, wide streets and see the Mississippi Mowing hy. Wide and handsome streets seem to ho u characteris tic of western cities. There is plenty of room. Crossing Iowa and Missouri, Kansas City was entered early Friday morning. A stop of four hours was made there, and tho time vt as improved by some to ride across the city on the elevated railway. While there it ltegait snowing, and tho storm increased during the day into a driving one, which tore doMii telegraph lines and pole so bad ly that we were obliged to wait tw elve houis in Tope k 11. Until we were nearly through Kansas, the prairies were covered with from four to six mche of snow. Af ter that we saw none except on the mouu tain peaks. We crossed the corner of Colorado into Net Mexico, ami stopped at I la tt 111 for hreakfust Sunday morning. This was not a gisnl place to make purchases, as one young l.itly thought, who rashly said she would take a ihueti doughnuts, and, on in tpiiriug the price, was told '(ive cents apiece. Apples ami bananas were also live cents each, and oread fifteen cents a Itiaf. A breakfast could he bought for To cents. e passed into Arizona on Monday morning, crusted the Colorado river into California the next morning, and reached Pasadena at one o'clock Wednesday morn ing, the 1 1th. Some prund mountain seen ery was seen in New Mexico when crossing the HiK'ky mountains. It is an up grade all the way from the MisHihMppi river, and at one oiiit among the moutitains an alti tude of NM)0 feet is reached an elevation greater than the highest peak of the White mountains The White mountains are beautiful, but the ltix'kifs are grand. They are rightly named, for they have ahnot no vegetation and consist of great inaxes of rock throw 11 up in the strangest forms. he soil is of a bright brick-red, ami seems peculiar to the mountain region, for that of the level land on either side is very dif ferent. In some places among the moun tains a kind of dttarf cedar grows, ami the dark green of itn foliage contrasts well with the red soil. In Ariotm the sandstone hlufTs and the ravines w her water iuu.t once have (lotted moke w ild scenery. One ravine or cafion i0 feet deep was crossed. It extends for ilea actors the prairie, and must have been worn Iown by (lotting water, though uow perfectly dry. Most of the inhabitants of Arizona und New Mexico are Mexican or Pueblo Indians. They are short in stature and inot repuKive looking. Their houses are made of mud or adobe, as it is called. Indeed, there are not many frame houses in the villages. It would seem that " Mobe or not Mobe" is the question in these coun tries. We saw large herds of sheep am! cattle, ami in some places large piles of hones beside the track, where they had died. I could not see w hat they or the (wople could live on, as wo saw not a roil of culti vated land after leaving Kansas until with in fifty miles of here. The vegetation that grows naturally is mostly cacti and sage brush. In some places there is a light cov ering of grass, hut tho sandy soil and lack of moUtuie prevents much from flowing. In New Mexico we passed quantities of prairie dogs hittintr on their mounds. They are cunning little fellows, soinew hat resem ling our woodchucks, but stunner and more nimble. An incident which occurred in Arizona gave us a realizing sense of be ing in tho region of cottboys. A young man from tho train refused to pay fif teen cents for a glass of beer. The saloon keeper drew a revolver and the young man paid the fifteen cents. After crossing tho Sun llemardmo moun tains we caino iuto a beautiful country. Imagine n large area of level land, with snow-crowned mountain peaks in the dis tance and orange groves, vineyards, flow ers and beautiful trees everywhere. There nre roses and geraniums uf all shades and kinds. The loveliest trees 1 have seen are the pepper trees. They are a little liko our elm, but not as tall aud more graceful, and covered with red berries. The rainy season has just begun, yester day being tho first rainy day since last Feb ruary. When tho rains do come, they have tho same effect that a warm rain does in tho spring ut home. Everything Bprings up and grows very rapidly. Today it seems like June in Vermont ; the sky is blue and cloudless, tho fields fresh and green, nnd, sitting by our open windows, we can hard ly realize that it is November Tho one disagreeable feature which I have seen as yet is the presence of mosquitoen. They are numerous, and apparently no better mannered than Vermont mosquitoes. Some account of this growing city of Pasadena, and of the fruit raising for which this region is so well adapted, must lie left until another time. Notwithstand ing the beauties of this place, it is notice able that people from the Kast almost in variably say t "Oh, yes, it Is lotely hero ; hut, after all, the Ivist is nUut as good a place to lift In."

Take the vote of Pennsylvania and that of Wisconsin, for instance, loth ItenuMican states, nnd it is surprising how little change has been made in the 1 whiles of these two widetv separated cominontvealths. In tho former the aggregate vote was 11)7, H14, an increase of OS.-lsfl over that of 181. The Republican Increase is ft!, (fti, or 11 per Oil), or n fraction over 11 per cent The increase of tho Prohibition vote is much larger, viz : from 15,7:17 in 188 1 to 20,747. These figures show remarkably steady olj tics in so large n state as Pennsylvania, In WiM-onsiti which Mr. Vilas, .Mr. Krice and other gifted Democratic leaders a few mouth since thought could bo revo lutionized in politics on the free trade issue thero has been almost es much iwlitical steadiness. The increase of votes there since IHMl was about 24,000. Of this in crease tho Republicans get more than one half, or 12,500, while the Democrats get a little more than n fifth, or 5000. The Pro hibitionists vet a sixth, and tho Jjihor party, now defunct, a tenth Of tho gains of the Republicans nnd Democrats, the Republi cans get 70 ier cent and tho Democrats JW per cent.

For instance, there is Missouri, where the old disloyal elements have been gradually weak ened or overjsowered by other and better elements whoe increase has been due to a variety of causes. The vote of Missouri for presidential electors in IKSI and WH was as follows IKSI. ISMS. Ih-mi-M-ratic ltepuhlicsj). Democratic pi 11 nil it MsUfiu ),Cfc. There was a large increase in the vote cast in Missouri this year, as compared w ith four years ago, but the larger share of it went to the Republicans. The Democratic plurality In the state was about 21 per cent less in 1HSS than it was in 1NS This result was due to causes that will continue to operate with increasing jtower, as the imputation of Missouri liecomes more and more and imbued with the educational, religious and other influences that have made Illinois what she is. Under such sa gacious leadership as that of Chauncey I. Filley ami other able Republicans, Missouri is morally certain Ui become n Republican .tnte within tho next four years. -V. 1".

Such a ret Uiou should receite the support of all who love that Justice Ami equality -din? to American citizenship: of atl who realize that lu this justice and equality our goterumeut finds its strength and pow er to protect the citizen and his properly; of all who liefieve that the contenteil conqietence and comfort of the many accords better with the spirit oi our instuutioiu man coiossai fortunes, unfairly gathered, lu the hands of a few; of all who appreciate that theforliearanceand fraterni ty among our people, which recognize the value of every American Interest, are the surest guar anty of our national progress; aud of all w ho de sire to see the products of American skill and in genuity Ineverv market of the world, with a re sulting restoration of American commerce. The necessity for the reduction of our revenue Is so a pi a rent as to be generally conceded; but the means by which this end shall lie accomplish ed, aud the sum of direct benefit which shall re suit to our citizens, present a controversy of the utmost fuqiortance. There should be no scheme accepted an satisfactory by which the burdens of the )eople uro only upiareutly remoted. Extrav agant appropriations of public money, with all their demoralizing cons imenoes, should nut be tolerated, either as a means of n-liet.liur the treux. ury of 1U present surplus, or as furuuhlng pre text for resisting a proper reduction In tariff rates. Existing evils and lujuslloea should be houestly recognized, boldly met, and effectitely remedied. There should be no cessation of the struggle until a revislou Is perfected, fair and conservative to ward existing Industrie, but which will reduce the price to consumers of the necessaries of life, while it provided for our manufactures the ad tan tfge of free raw materials, ami jieimlts no injury to the uiU-resU of American labor, 'ihe cause for which the buttle Is waged is comprised within lines clearly and distinctly defined, it should never be compromised, It Is the people's cause. It cannot be denied thut the selfish and priv ate in terests, which art so iierslsteutly heard when ef forts are made to deal In a just and comprehen sive maimer with our tariff laws, are related to, if they are uot responsible for, the sentiment largely prevailing among tho ieopld, that the general government is the fountain of individual and private, aid, that It may beexjiccted to relieve with internal care the distress of citizens and communities, and that from the fulness of its treasury It should, upon the slightest jiossiblu pre text of promoting the geueral gotsj, apply public funds to the I tenet It of localities and individuals; nor can It be denied that there is a ifrouiiiif as sumption that, as against tho government aud lu favor of private claims and Interest, the usual rules and limitations of business principles aud just dealing should be waited. These idem hate heeu. unhappily, much eucouruged by leKlslallte aonuiescenoo. Relief from contracts made with the government is too easily accorded lu favor of the citizen; the folium to support ilaluis against the government by proof Is often supplied by no better consideration than tho wealth of the gov ernment and the poverty of the claimant.
