On Monday, in tbe afternoon, she got out of bed to allow tbe removal of some farnltui e, and, going Into another room, at ouce seized a very large knife itr carver) and plunged It Into ber abdomen, without making any noise or demonstration. Her husband went into the room immediately afterward, and, taking no notice of what nau occurred, sue lifted up tbe bloody knlie and said, "Jim, I have slabbed myaeU." in a short time a number of neighbors were in tbe bouse, to whom s .e said that she had doue it purposely, that she was perfectly tan-, mat she wauled to die, and abe had done ihe deed wltn the intention of putting an end to ber own lifa.

We publish the following from General Wright, In explanation of the causes of the heartfelt appeal of our correspondent "J," who, In yesterday Appeal, very forcibly and Justly urged the attention of the public and our State authorities to IhecondlUou of the lunatics confined In the county Jail. As the sheriff is not to blame, and can ueiiher Inter vene authority or help tbe evils complained of, we hope the members of the Legislature repreaenting Hbelby county will take steps to remedy the delects of existing laws, and pro vide for tbe Immediate relief of the moat unfortunate of our helpless classes : Edavr appeal I thank your correspond ent "K,"for calling puLlic attention to a mat ter tbat baa given me a great deal of trouble In the adm.nistratlon of ihe duties of my office. I refer to the fact of luwuie persous be ing confined in the county Jail. Under the present leguiaUuns of the "Hos pital lor the insane," at ISasuviile, A np any tou-,4 Is required tube given to the superin tendent beiure any inmates can he received. This is un account of the crowded oonuit on of tbe hospital, the new wing provided for by tbe last legislature not having been completed, ine laws of tbe Stale provide that ail insane persons wbo are llkeiy to do themselves or others bodily barm, snail be committed to tbe county Jail lor safekeeping unlii such time as they cau be sent to me insane hospital at aSashville. So that when a magistrate sends me a miiinuus loi me committment of a luu a tic or insane person, I am cmtpe led by law, to bold the person in j.ll until In or she can be received into the bospital at .Nashville, lu several lnaia.ces disregarding the rules of the btaie uospitai,) l nave seut insane per sons to ISasbville to be recelvea Into tbe hospital without giving tbe tulity dav notice and lnsUad of getting iuto the hospital they have teen cmlneu tn ca Ltavuuon cjumtj ni, wnicn is not so comioita ble as our Jail, and tbe bill for their support baa been Bent and collected from bhelby county. In the case of the parties referred to by your corresboudeni "K.." none i has beeu given tue superintendent, and I only awall to bear from mm to send tnem on. It must be known to 4,K " tbat tbe Shelby county Jan was ouiit ror tne purpose ol con fining criminals, that It is not adapted eltnei to hospital purposes or to the keeping of luna tics: lb t uu proper provision l- made by me authorities either lor clothing, feeding or iodulbgany class of persons, except persob chsi . ed wltb crime. Hence, whhe the t..u f ict i mc to receive UhMctiuMuf persuti it maktt no ai ran if men is ior men proper ii eaimeni . By ibe i.ree-it law each county pays ail tbe expenses oi lis o u iiaue persons, auu uu inanity would dictate that he county author ties provide sulLbie uuarters, loou and alien tion in connection wiih ltspoorhouse for the unfortunate class of persons during the time tbey have lo await an order for reception into ta State asylum, ibe party Bpoaen ol by your correspondent a being in almost a state of nudity, will not suffer coming to remain on her. she is a ra in a maniac, and w hue .he suits, and bis allauts du all they c.n amwiiorate ner couuuion, Luey nave uu means ol uroi er oontrol or Ueatmeui in such cases as an ofilver of the law, Hhw Lditora, I have bothimr lo do but to obev tbe law . 1 can not iagiaiate. 1 agree with your correspond ent that some other place ought to be prov Ided for these people uutn tne county j,:., ana tr 1st U will soou be dune; but as the law now is. 1 can do nothing but obey It.
