Chicago University Professor Turned Down by Trades Assembly. Columbus, 0., Dec. 14.Consider- able comment has been occasioned at the action of the Columbus trades and assembly in declining to accept the services of a professor of the Chi cago university to deliver a course of lectures here under the auspices of the assembly. The assembly was asked to pay a portion of the expenses of the professor and the assembly promptly declined to receive the services of the Chicago man. The reason given is that the Chicago university has had John D. Rockefeller as a benefactor and it is almost entirely disc- to his escaped contributions that the university owes its extensiveness and high tank in the educational world. One of the dole gates maintained that the professors at the Unnersity of Chicago had to teach and stand for the things that were favored by the oil magnate and when they ceased to do this their posi tions were jeopardized. In view of this the pre insition was turned down and a committee consisting of Dele gates Phelan, Houck and Little ap pointed to arrange for lectures, secur ing them from a "source above SUF plclon S*..
