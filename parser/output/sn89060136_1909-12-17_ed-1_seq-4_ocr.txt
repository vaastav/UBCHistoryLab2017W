The Baltimore News on Sunday cele brated the first anniversary of the es- lablisbment of its Sunday evening edition. Unlike most Sunday issues, the News is not a journalistic monstrosity, but a “news” paper. The news asserts no paper ever started under such adverse conditions as did the Sunday edition, and that few papers have ever made such progress in their first year. Col. George W. Goethals, being the only man who has shown a disposition to take the job and stay by it, is to be re warded by a grant of supreme power over the building of the Panama canal. If the bill which has been reported by the House committee parses, Col. Goethals will be made, in his own province, the most powerful official ever created under tbe American Government. The bill provides for the abolition of the Canal Commission and tbe creation in its stead of a director general. Colonel Goethals is to be appointed in this position. In order to. demonstrate methods of killing fruit tree pests and of pruning trees, Pennsylvania has selected 1,000 orchards in different sections of the State where an opportunity will be given fruit growers and farmers to see men sent by the State spray and prune trees, as well as hear them lecture. The expense of the work is borne by the State and it is expected in this manner to conduct a campaign of practical instruction that will not only redound to the benefit of - owners of orchards, but be a means of furthering the fruit growing interests of the State as well. Senator Rayner, of Maryland, declares President Zelaya of Nicaragua, must pay for the murder of the two Americans rec ently executed in that country, with his life. The Senator, in support of his resolution authorizing the President of tbe U. S. to take steps to apprehend Zelaya and bring him to trial for tbe murder of Groce and Cannon, in a speech before tbe Senate, branded the Nicaraguan President as the most, despicable figure *lhat has ever risen in the revolutionary history of Central America, standing without a peer in ihe school of corruption, dishonor, perfidy and crime. Notwithstanding President Taft in his message recommends tbe postal saving bank, tbe news sent out from Washing ton is to the effect that Congress will not pujh the plan until next year. In place of the postal savings bank, which is op. posed by Wall street, efforts will be made by the Aldrich-Cannon crowd, who con trol Congress, to force through the cen tral bank, a cut and dried Wall street scheme. . ... The central bank, with its branches, is a plan to place control of finances of the country entirely in tbe hands of Wall street, by establishing a big money Irust, and it would not oply dominate all small banks but virtually place all business interests at the mercy of the big finan ciers. Wall street has been planning the central bank for twelve years, and hopes now with Aldrich and Cannon in control to force it through Congress, despite the -efforts of the progressive republicans and the democrats to defeat tbe nefarious scheme. • Want Government To Buy Chesa peake Canal. The purchase of the Delaware & Ches apeake canal by the Government is again to be urged at this session of Congress, when a bill with this purpose in view is to be introduced. The improvement of this canal by the Government has been the subject of agi tation for years, and a bill is how being prepared authorizing such a step. The outlook for this bill, which will shortly be introduced, is considered very prom ising. The Delaware & Chesapeake canal has been' twice favorably reported to Congress for'improvement into a ship canal of a sufficient depth to allow coast wise liners and the heavier barges free passage. The Aguns Commission some years ago recommended that it be pur chased by the Government for 12,514,289, and the Committee of Congress on Rail- 1 ways and Canals also reported favorably on its purchase. This canal is probably tbe most impor tant link in the inland coastal project of the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Associa tion, and at the two conventions of that body in Baltimore and Norfolk, Govern ment action upon it was urged. 

WASHINGTON LETTER The first week of the Congressional ses sion has been uneventful. Both Houses have adjourned from day to day and next to no business of a legislative character has been transacted. The fact that two large conventions, one tbe Southern Commercial agjl Industrial Congress and the other the Waterways Congress have been in session in Washington has de tracted from tbe national Congress by drawing to its sessions Members and Sen ators, Cabinet Ministers, and the Presi dent himself, who made a speech at tbe opening of this convention. President Taft spokq discouragingly with reference to the scheme for the issue of United States Bonds to tbe amount of half a billion dollars to be used for the im provement of tbe Navigable water ways of the United States. This phase of tbe question however is so dear to tbe three or four thousand delegates of the con vention who are now in Washington and is urged with so much force and earnest ness by distinguished men throughout the country that it is difficult to'under stand how the bond issue can be success fully Opposed. The present generation can scarcely expect to see the com-' pletion_of an enterprise so vast. Tbe en joyment of the advantages of tbe im provements in tbe waterways, undertaken now, must be mainly by posterity, .a posterity that will be as much wealthier and abler to pay the half billion of dollars as the United States of today is wealthier and abler than it was before tbe Civil war. In the President’s message to Congress and in the Departmental reports of the various Cabinet officers much stress and emphasis has been given to the-sub ject of economy Economy is no doubt good in national affairs as it doubtless is in household management, but it is more beautiful and easier as a theory than as a practice. Every one remembers bow re cently tbe cant of the Simple Life, was on the lips of everyone. It was promulgated from the White House; but,Mr. Roosevelt in the interest of peace urjfced the build ing of Dreadnoughts at tbe cost of many millions of dollars. So it has been with past Congresses and doubtless will be with the when the budget is finally made up in June, July or August next tbe billion dollar mark will have been passed V Tbe Secretary of the Navy is making most commendable efforts to improve con ditions in the Department over which he presides and it is given out that the young and brilliant. Naval Officers who have graced the ball rooms and salons and clubs iu Washington, New York, Boston and other Naval Stations must actually go to sea. Naval statisticians have just discovered that Germany has taken tbe second place among tbe world’s naval powers and that this place which we appeared to bold a year of eighteen months ago when our great fleet eD. circled the globe, is ours no louger. It is further shown that although we spend many more millions than Germany in tbe building and maintenance of our navy that of Germany is stronger in ships and guns and men than is ours. These are not pleasant facts but they are stubborn ones and we would better face them now than after it will be too late. * * * With tbe information that tbe Paual Canal will be finished iu probably less than five years arises tbe importance of its proper defense. Military engineers have recently reported that its protection will not be difficult. It will not be necessary to build fortifications on the island or breakwaters extending at one end into tbe Pacific and at the other into tbe Atlantic. It is thought that it will be only necessary to dredge tbe approaches to tbe Canal so that they will be narrow, not more than five hundred feet in width, permitting the approach of not more than two ships abreast and these if unfriendly war ships would be able to fire not broad side discharges but only with the stem guns. Batteries could be placed com manding tbe long and narrow approachea to the entrance of tbe Canal so as tp be destructive to vessels coming within five or six miles of any part of tbe Canal that might be injured by them. Another question of interest with re gard to tbe Canal relates to tbe petty republic of Colombia through which tbe Canal passes. Colombia is of course a Republic or a nation oDly in name or at the French say ponr rire. The real Gov ernment there is the Government of the Canal Zone. All that there ia of law or order, of Sanitation or of prosperity is an importation from the United States. Before the Canal enterprise transfigured it it was a yellow fever pest hole, a neck of land over which travelers hurried fear ing to breathe. Now it is as healthy as any place in the United States. The American Minister, Mr. Sqniers, has been recalled and it is said that any diplomatic relations of the United States with Colombia have been permantly discon tinued. The petty local-Government is not only not helpful to the United States, it is annoying in that it is claiming the acres of land that have been built up in the sea and lagoons surrounding the mouths of the canal, from the millions of cubic yards of earth and stone taken from the canal prism. Doep Not Want Judgeship. Governor Crothers stamps as untrue the report being circulated that he proposed to take Judge Pearce’s seat in the Court of Appeals as the representative of the Second Judicial circuit, which includes Cecil county, leaving it to the President of the State Senate, who will presumably be Gorman, to fill out t\je few months remaining of the term. Conv cerning the rumor, the Governor said : “There is no truth whatever in it. The bench has no attractions for me, and I have never had, the slightest inclination to return to it. In saying this I have no purpose, of course, of reflecting on the judiciary, for the duties attached to those offices are the most honorable and dignified in the State. The life, however, does not appeal to me.” The gossip linking up the name of Gov ernor Crothers with Judge Pearce’s seat in the Court of Appeals was supplement ed by the announcement that Senator Gorman, then the acting Governor, would be the. logical man for the Democrats to nominate as their candidate, and while in office he cpuld make a vigorous fight at the close of his term to wrest the Federal Senatorship. t from Isador Rayner, the ambition of State Senator Gorman being to succeed his-father in the National Sen ate. Judge Pearce’s term expires in 1912, but he reaches the age limit in 1911. Governor Crothers has often declared his purpose of filling out his term as Gov ernor and then qnietlyS retiring to Elkton to continue the practice of law. Lawyers in Judge Pearce’s circuit are very much about his retire ment from the bench. Petitions are now being circulated for presentation to the General Assembly asking it to waive the rule in favor of Judge Pearce so that he may serve out the full teFm for which he was chosen. Judge Pearce is as vigorous today as he ever was. Ap a matter of fact, he is the mainstay of the courts in the Second circuit, the court terms in the counties of the circuit being conducted as late as o’clock at night in order that the people may have the benefit of his services in all the counties. His possible retirement from the bench is regarded as a public calamity. The petitions asking for his retention on the bench are being signed by all members of the bar regard less of politics.
