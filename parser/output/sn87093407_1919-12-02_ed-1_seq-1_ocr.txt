FRANK CRANE Copyright, lilt, by Frank Crane A boil on the nock may not weigh an ounce, yet it frets more attention than the other two hundred pounds or so of flesh. One sore finger causes more care than the nine that are all right. The short cut to notoriety is by way of being a nuisance. Get out on the street and yell and immediately n crowd will collect; go along and behave yourself and nobody will notice you. One mad dog excites the whole populace; mean while the 276 unmad dogs go around hunting negli gible bones. Let any lady, aweary of being undistinguished, walk abroad in trousers and blow a honi, and she will straightway have her fill of mention. Let the poor parson, tired of saving sinners in obscurity, stand on his head in the pulpit, sprinkle a few cuss-words at the church sociable, or elope with his neighbor's wife, and he will at last see his name and face on the front page. In your village are a hundred houses, mute and inglorious, also unwept, unhonored and unsung: but start a scandal in one of them, and it will loom from the common mass as if a Woolworth building. Newspapers are necessary. It is well to know what's going on. But the most important things that go on do m ' printed. Just the loud The burglar .urderer, the Bolshevik, the window-smasher soap-box apostle, really don't amount to much. They have little to do with the communal life. They are warts on the body politic. Newspapers feature what is unusual. But what is unusual is not typically true. If it were, it would be usual. Pool*, it has been observed, admire the extraor dinary; wise men. the ordinary. And we are mostly fools. The amazing, influential, vital and worth-while history of the people does not get itself written. When you are in Paris, and read of a riot on the harbor front in New York, you fancy the whole metropolis is in an uproar; really the millions of the city knew nothing of .the affair except thru the papers, and were busy selling goods and peeling potatoes as usual. I venture to say that even now in Russia, where we suppose everybody to be shaking in their boots, there are millions of people who are sowing and reap ing, loving and quarreling, about as they did under the czar. We hear a deal about the revolt of labor. Yet there ire only a few million labor union members, and not all of them on strike, while the most of the hundred million unorganized workers are plugging along in peace. Cheer up! Any morning's issue of the newspaper would indicate we are on tho verge of a revolution. But the newspaper features the blatherskite. If it told of all the sober, conscientious and decent workers that are going aloni,' minding their business, it would require 20,0<)0 pages of fine type. And you wouldn't read it.
