8 Cbc Cruc northerner: paw paw, Blcblflan, frlDa, Dec 8, 1005. PRES DENT S MESSAGE President Roosevelt annual message has bevn delivered to ronress. Open ing with a plea for the en-operation of nil classes In continuing the country's prosperity and in correcting existing evils, for a 'square leal" for every body, the message ilrst takes up the question of corporation ami railroad rate legislation. The president Kays: . 'oriorn I Idim. I nut in no sense hostile to corpora tions. This Is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all combina tion will be not only useless, but In the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce law Inevitably produces. The corpora tion has come to stay, just as the trades union has come to stay. 1'ach can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as It does good. Hut each 'should be sharply checked where It ucts against law and Justice. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of these gre.it corporations by state ac tion. Huch regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose Jurisdiction Is coex tensive with the held work of the cor porations that is, by the national gov ernment. 1 believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves Impossible, it will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the na tional government by atlirmative nc ment of the constitution. The laws of the congress and of the several states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often In showing that the states have no power In the matter than that the na tional government has power; so that there nt present exists a very unfortu nate condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an in terstate business occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national government having effective control over them. Oar steady aim should be by legislatioti. cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the na tional government by atlirmative ac tion. This is only in form an innovation. In substance It is merely a restoration, for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies, and all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in ! such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it has J always possessed, not only in this conn- try, but also in England before and j since this country became a separate j nation. I lldilrnad Hnt l.i;ilntiii. As 1 said in my ni''.age of Dec. i 1 last, the immediate and most pressing , need so far as legislation is concerned j is the enactment into law of some j scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision and regu- I lation of the rates charged by the rail I roads of the country engaged in inter state traflic as shall summarily and ef- J festively prevent th" impsition of nn'- j jut or unreasonable rates. It mu-t ! Include putting a compete stop to re-bnP-s in every shape and lo'vu. This j power to regulate rates, like -til similar ! powers over the business world, should be exercised with moderation, caution and self restraint, but it should exist, j so that it can be effectively exercised when the need arises. In my Judgment, the most important provision which such law should con tain is that conferring upon some com petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought before it whether a given rate pre scribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found to be unreason able and unjust then, after full investi gation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rale beyond which it shall ' liot be lawful to g-the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly call edthis decision to go into effect with in a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate is too high, but that a fa vored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the commission would have the right to fix this already estab lished minimum rate as the maximum, and it would need only one or two such decisions by the commission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving improper minimum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my pro posal is ii( t to give the commission power to initiatH or originate rates gen erally, but to regulate a rate already lixed or originated by the roads upon complaint and after investigation. A heavy penalty should be exacted from nny corporation which fails to respoet nn order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation. It is worth while considering whether It would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action j against the h neticiary of a rebate for i nt least twice the value of the rebate. . This would help stop what is really ( blackmail. Elevator allowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demor alizing and ate used as rebates. ; Prlinfp Cir I.lnr. All private car lines. Industrial roads, refrigerator charges and the like should be expressly put tinder the su pervision of the Interstate commerce commission or rom simll.tr body sr far ns rates and agreements practical Jy affecting rates are concerned. A re bate in Icing charges or In mileage or in l u division of the rate for refrigerating charges is Just as p ruicious as a re bate In any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers. Only In this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted into the national banks by the bank examiners. A few lirst class "railroad accountants, If they had prop er direction and proper authority to in spect books and papers, could accom plish much in preventing willful viola tlons of the law. The He veil lira. There Is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an Ideal per feet ion In the methods of raising rev enue, and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change In these methods ren tier such change Inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. No change can be made on lines beneficial to or desired by one section or one state only. There must be something like a general agree ment among the citizens of the several states 'that the change Is needed and desired in the interest of the people as a whole, and there should then be a sin cere, intelligent and disinterested ef fort to make It in such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maxi mum of good to the people at large with the minimum of necessary disre gard for the special interests of locali ties or classes, but in time of peace the revenue must, on the average, taking a series of years together, equal the expenditures or else the revenues must be Increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. It is impossible to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it is as yet too early to say whether then will be need for it. It should bo considered whether It is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or In favor of any other nation maximum and minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure a certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. ruuuiijr In IZxpeiullture. I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy and, to this end. of a rigid scrutiny of appropria tions. All unnecessary offices should be abolished. In the public printing also a large saving of money can be made. There Is a constantly growing tendency to publish masses of unim portant information at which no human being ever looks. Vet, in speaking of economy, I must in nowise be understood as advocating the false economy which is in the end the worst extravagance. To cut down in the navy would be a crime against the nation. To fail to push forward all work on the Panama canal would be as great a folly. Cnrrenry. Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist in an inadequate volume of money, but in the rigidity of this volume, which does not respond as it should to the varying needs of communities and of seasons. Inflation must be avoided, but some provision should be made that will Insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than in trrf less ac tive seasons of the year, so that the currency w ill contract against specula tion and will expand for the needs of legitimate business. At present the treasury department is at Irregularly recurring intervals obliged in the inter est of the business world that is. in tin- interests of the American public to try to avert financial crises by pro viding a remedy which should be pro vided by congressional action. .1iiiliun lii Statehood. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona bo admitted as one state. The I'iiiiiiiiui Omul. Active work in canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been in prog ress for less than a year and a half. Inning that period two points about the canal have ceased to be open to debate. First, the question of route; se ond, the question of feasibility. The point which remains unsettled is wheth er the canal shall be one of several locks above sea level or at sea level with a sing e tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the congress at an early day the findings of the advisory board of American and European en gineers. In addition to sanitating the isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provid ed for employees and an adequate sys tem of supplying them with wholesome food at reasonable prices has been cre ated. Hospitals have been established and equipped that are without superi ors of their kind anywhere. During the part year a large portion of the plant with which the work is to bo done has been ordered. It is confident ly believed that by the middle of the approaching year a sufficient propor tion of this plant will have been in stalled to enable us to resume the work of excavation on a large scale. What Is needed now and without de lay is nn appropriation by the congress to meet the 'current and accruing ex penses of the commission. The first appropriation of $10,out),(X0 out of the $1."m".jo,000 authorized by the Spooner act was made three years ago. It 1 nearly exhausted. Unless the congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. In conclusion the president recom mends an increase in the diplomatic and consular service and more ad equate compensation of Its members. he at "The Copyright 1905 i v Hart Schattncr Mary lm: wm$m mi E.
