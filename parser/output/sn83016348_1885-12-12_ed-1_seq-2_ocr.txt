The venerable Mr. Tililen has just written a letter urging the necessity of an extensive system of sea coast fortifi c itions. Whatever merit there may be in his recommendations, yet it is possi ble, that if the Republicans had adopted such a system Mr. Tilden would have as readily denounced it. Such is par tisanship. ~ Congress set up in business at the o’d stand on Monday. Although gen erally there is little significance in a man’s name, yet the names of some of the new members are well calculated to render the life of a reading clerk miserable. Listen to such euphonious cognomens as these: Lehlbach, La Follette, Loutilt Romeis, Stahlnecker, Van Schaick and Outhwaite. In ad dition to this there are many doubles. There are two Adamses, two Allens, a pair of Andersens, a biace of lirecken ridges, a trio of Browns, a quartette of Campbells, two Davidsons, two Gib sons, two Greens, three Hendersons, two Joneses, two Johnsons and a John ston, a pair of O’Niells, a Reed and a Reid and four Taylors. The Thomases go in pairs and so do the Wards, the Weavers, the Warners and the Whites Tariff reforms and free-traders alike at Washington pretend to extract com fort from the President’s message. The free-traders assert that a bill to reduce the tariff is sure to pass, while Mr. Ran dall who represents the protection ele ment of his party smiles and says, “it is an excellent message.” Mr. Morri son thinks that the President did not mean anything in particular when he spoke of reducing the tariff on the nec essaries of life. Ile said : “The mes sage ought to be entirely satisfactory to the tariff reformers.” The President recommends greater reductions than I proposed in my bill in the last Con gress. In saying that the reductions should be made first in the duties on the common necessaries of life I do not think he meant or thought of any particular article. Talk of that sort is always general. Yet it is this very general talk on the tariff question that creates the uncertainty so disastrous to our industries. It is the uncertainty which kills. The local page of The Whig con tains this week a Thanksgiving sermon preached in Port Deposit on last Thanksgiving Day by the Rev. Mr. Barrett. It is a sermon of no ordinary ability and far superior to the usual class of such efforts. Thankfulness as a duty is urged by Mr. Barrett, and every reason for thankfulness as a duty is given. The many events of the year are eloquently enumerated, re vealing the cause for national gratitude ; and the events of all time, considering first the divine events of God’s mercy and love, are noted that we may see cause for universal, continual, and ’ 1 eternal gratitude. The sweeter laws , of life and love are urged to replace the inhuman creeds of se'fishness and coveting, and altogether the sermon is ( a complete and perfect lesson of the year tempered by a deep theological ( teaching and a spirit of devoutness that turns its readers to thoughts of ] worldless purity and unspotted Chris tianity. The correspondent of a prominent i nr. ui a piumillLlll New York daily has recently ventilated the evils of absenteeism in Congress. It is a timely subject, since it has be come a colossal evil. Members of congress receive a salary of £5,000. They are allowed twenty cents a mile for travel to and from the capital. They receive $125 at each session for stationery. They get and transmit free by the mails all publications au thorized by congress, seeds from the Agricultural Department, and flowers trom the botanical and other gardens. They enjoy other perquisites and privi leges unknown to their constituents, and no small share of patronage. With all these benefits, Representatives and ( Senators are constantly delinquent in duty. By the act of Aug. 16, 1556, it is declared that “the secretary of the Senate and Sergeant-at-Arms of the House, respectively, shall deduct from the monthly payments of each member or delegate the amount of his salary ifor each day that he has been absent ;from the Senate or House, respec tively, unless such member or delegate ■assigns as the reason for such absence Jthe sickness of himself or of some [member of his family. Absence with ipay is thus limited to sickness of the member or of his family. This law is practically a dead letter. It is abso tllutely ignored in the Senate. In the louse it is nullified by a rule which lermits excuse for absence and saves Ik- pay. Hence it is a daily practice fir members to ask leave of absence jor a limited time, and often indefi nitely, on “important business,” or for other reasons. In every case of ab senteeism personal interests are treated '1 |S superior to public duty. This prac- : lice has been carried to such an ex- 1 cut that constituencies in the House 1 01 and States in the Senate are almost t left without representation during the < greater part of each session of con- . gress. On the aSth of February, only : three days before the adjournment, i when most important legislation was 1 pending, one hundred and thirty-three ’ absentees were reported in the House and twenty seven in the Senate, or moi e than a third of each body. It is no secret that several of the appropria tion bills, which the Senate loaded down with extravagant amendments, were actually passed in the House without the presence of a quorum. The danger of such legislation need not be criticised. The Representa tives who now want a change in the rules are, in many instances, respon sible for this abuse of trust, and for the faithless performance of duty. A 

POINT IN THE MESSAGE. President Cleveland’s first annual message was presented to the first session of the Forty-Ninth Congress on Tuesday last. With the exception of a few very bitter free-trade jour nals editorial comment upon it has been favorable. In fact it is gener ally pronounced a good thing. It is only through editorial comment that the majority of newspaper readers and the majority of those who don’t read the newspapers at all will get the full gist of the important docu ment. Watched and waited for with interest it has been received with interest. Viewed carefully and in its entirety it does not come up to oar standard of what Mr. Cleveland should have done in the way of an annual message but considered in the abstract, with particular atten tion given to two or three of its better features it is a fine piece of work. As the Philadelphia Daily JVcu's suggests, few presidents have given so much space to our foreign rela tions as Mr. Cleveland has devoted to them. This reveals a character in the man which we teel inclined to admire. It is growing more evident every day that as a nation we are at taining an appearance ot added strength in tlie eyes of foreign pow ers. It is something to be thankful for that, with a few exceptions, our foreign relationships have been pleas ant. Several delicate complications with the governments of Germany and Austria have arisen, requiring great diplomacy in their proper set tlement, and to which settlement the government had better not rely too much upon its faith in circumstance. With Spain and the Spanish Amer ican nations our relations are yet in definite and the compacts with them are not yet fairly established as they should be. There are several pro positions in the President's message, such as the recasting of the diploma tic and consular service by instituting consular inspectorships, of detailing military' and naval attaches, of ap pointing secretaries of legations at large, and of grading the diplomatic offices, so as to enable the holders to live in comfort, which are worthy execution, and which when concluded will improve us as a nation in many lights. As an important and valuable par ticipant in the events of the world, beyond what occurs in bwr own im mediate limits, the American nation has been liberally recognized in the President's message, and the recog nition should become general both at home and abroad. Our interests have rapidly extended to all quarters of the globe, The growth and in crease of this important foreign rela tionship is evidence of the sterling metal of which the ribs of the nation are formed. It can not longer be called “the young America,” in all the ways of government it is wise and matured, it is more than an in fant power, it has grown loud enough and large enough to be sccti and heard in the world, and the wisdom ot the policy of President Cleveland in devoting so much of his time and at tention to the perfection and advance ment of our numerous foreign rela tionship cannot be denied. Unbar monious as the relationship has been in several instances nothing like con cealed hatred or open warfare lias occurred, and it is the wish of its au thor and every reader of the annual message that the future increase of her power is to be obtained through peaceful intercourse alone. 

HIGH AND COOK ALIKE. Without token of the event, without appreciation for either his great name or great wealthy the relentless hand of : death descended upon the apparent'y robust form of Wm. H. Vanderbilt, lie : great financier and railroad king, Tues day last. We do not doubt that at the same instant his last mortal breath was counted the last smi'e played about the faces and the last tear trickled down the cheeks of a million more in New York city with souls like his but just his opposite in wealth and distinction. The poor in their filthy hovels are not neglected by death any more than are the rich in their stately mansions. Rich and poor alike is the old old creed ol death, and it will be carried out by it so long as men have ills and are fit for immortality. The death of Wm. H.Van derbilt cannot exactly be called a na tional bereavement, but it is a death that will attract national inter est, because of the national reputation he bore. It is a difficult thing to estimate the worth of Mr. Vanderbilt either to the nation or to himself. Certain it is he has been called away ere he had done half the good in the world he should have done, and which is a direct sign and token that his future course did not hold much good in it or it would not have been so suddenly curtailed. His spirit was in fested with that peculiar passion for gold. Such a passion make* a mans nature as hard as the glittering metal itself. livery pure and lofty desire of the heart is made subordinate to the base and material desire of the mind I for possession and estate. It is gen- 1 erally known that Mr. Vanderbilt’s; 1 financial desires were pretty fully ob- j tained. Yet he might just as well have 1 had nothing more than the street waif j wllft* the omnipotent summons c.une off Tuesday. The vital spark ot charity in Mr. Vanderbilt’s nature was very small indeed, sometimes entirely inyis ible; yet one chord of generosity at least vibrated through his frame, for in the immediate social relationships of i his family and personal friends he was | kind in heart and liberal m purse to a i certain extent. Ile had the miserly i ambition, however, to return whatever | wealth he had in the immediate family of Vanderbilt - Only a few days ere his death his son was given an immense estate on Long Island ; gifts of the kind to his children have been occassional, yet the great wide world throbbing about him with its poverty and misery was passed by unthought of. It must be a sad thought to the man of wealth, when he sees the honey arm of the grim de stroyer reaching closer and closer to histhroat, that with all his dimes and dollais that have jingled so merrily in his ears not one has been loaned to heal the great disease of woe and want and suffering that broods above our land. “I might have done so much the world,’’ he is apt to think. Ah ! that little term, “it might have beep,” is a bad thing to have stuck in a man’s throat when the death rattle is upon him. Even the wealth of Van derbilt could not purchase happiness. The cares and anxi dies of such a life as his forbade peace of mind or body. The continual turmoil of traffic was his dearest pleasure. The rise and fall in stocks was the only ebbing and (lowing tide of amusement that ever rippled through his life, and we doubt not that the sweetest music his ears ever heard was that of the death-bells when they rang to him on Tuesday last. The world must not be uncharitable, to the uncharitable, however. The faults ot ■ the few are seldom outnumbered by the virtues of the many, and the beam in one man’s eye does not deserve more censure than the mote in another’s. The greatest trouble with Vanderbilt was his persistent failure to grow human and embrace brotherhood in his na ture. To pile Pelions of gokl upon Ossas of paying dividends was the ob ject of his thought and labor. To have spread those mountains of wealth out in the day where the needy and suffer ing could behold and partake would have been a nobler life work. His silent charities were very many, no doutbt, but the enormous piles of wealth of which he died possessed are not credi table evidence of any extended acts of liberality. Perhaps he had learned to regard death as an impossibility in his life and that he might when it came induce it to defer its work upon him for a certain time in consideration of a few shares in Northern Pennsylvania or Western Union. But death never comes to earth to reap aught than men’s souls ; there is no bribe in all the world that will tempt it to loosen its hold upon the throat of its victim, be he a good man or a bad man. It should not be in ferred that Vanderbilt was a bad man, or a criminal man. He was simp'y an imperfect man, because he did rot put | in use those glorious opportunities which ! lay in his power to benefit mankind.' What the result of his death will be to | the world can be easily estimated, j Neither were very closely related in a | mutually beneficial way, and the falling i off of one leaves the other, uiial- I tered, except with the differences of | one toiler less upon the earth one miser i less to gather in its harvests of gold, ' monopolize its wealthy fruitage to the | exclusion of the honest man of worth who cannot cry out so loud in his pov erty or to he heard above the clanking metal of the miser. The fluctuating and ebbing tide of railroad and corpor ation stocks will be effected vividly for a short lime, the voices of lawyers and heirs will be heard for a brief period disputing the distribution of the wealthy man'; money, but beyond that the death of Win. H. Vanderbilt will be no more in the eyes of i,e?yen and the eyes of men than the death of yotfoey beg gar at the corner. TEACHERS* association. Mr. John S.

The President’s first annual mes sage was presented to Congress at noon on Tuesday last. The following arc its salient features. After referring to the death of Vice-President Hen dricks. the President says : The consti tution, which requires those chosen to legislate tor the people to annually meet in the discharge of their solemn trust, also requires the President to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall deem necessary and expe dient. The President then has a great deal to say about our relations with the foreign powers. Stating his happiness to announce that the relations of the United States with all foreign powers continues to be friendly. He speaks of the complication between the Ar gentine Confederation and the Falk land Islands and states that this gov ernment considers the claim of the argentine power for indemnity from this nation as groundless. In consid ering the foreign relationships he goes on to speak of Mr. Keilley’s late ven ture with the Austrian government; the treaty made by his predecessor with the Nicaragan government for the con struction of a canal through Nicaragan territory by and at the sole cost of the American government; the harmony with the Chinese government and the condition of the question with the Chinese in the west; the attitude of Germany towards the existing treaties of naturalization remarking that the temperate and just attitude taken by this government with regard to this class of question will doubtless lead to a satisfactory understanding; of the question of North American fisheries of which he says he recommended that congress provide for the appointment of a commission in which the govern ments of the United States and Great Kritiun shall be respectively repre sented to settle upon an equitable and honorable basis the question of the fishing rights of the two governments and their respective citizens on the coast of the United States and .British North America ;of the question con cerning our citizens in Turkey, stating that no statuary provision exists pro viding means for renouncing citizen ship by an American citizen native born or naturalized nor for terminating and vacating an unproper acquisition of.citizenship; of the Spanish treaty and the question of duties with that country ; and of the Diplomatic service which he thinks should be given more careful attention by congress and at every post where a representative is necessary the salary should be so graded as to permit him to live with comfort. The President has taken great care with his treatment of these foreign subjects. The remaining por tion of his address we will give in brief synopsis as the nature and impor tance of the subjects treated permit: 

TARIFF ON ART WORKS. Past Congresses have had under consideration the advisability of abol ishing the discrimination made by the I tariff law in favor of the works of I American artists. The odium of the j policy which subjects to a high rate of j duty the paintings of foreign artists and | exempts the productions of American [ artists residing abroad, and who re j ceive gratuitously advantages and in j struction, is visited upon our citizens ! engaged in art culture in Europe, and j has caused them with practical unam j mity to favor the abolition of such an | ungracious distinction and in their in | terest, and for other obvious reasons I ! strongly recommend it. the finances of the nation. The ordinary receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June jo ISSS, were 8322,690,706,38. Of this sum $181,471,939,34 was received from customs and 8112,498,725,54 from internal revenue. The total re ceipts were 824,829,163.54 less than those for the year ended June 30, ■ 884. 1 hi* dimunitjon embraces a falling of 813.595,550,42 in the re ceipts from customs, and 89,687,346.- 97 in the receipts from internal rev enue. The total ordinary expenditures of the government for the fiscal year were $260,226,935.50, leaving a sur plus in the treasury at the close of the year of $63,463,771.27. This is $40,- 929.85.4-42 iea* than the surplus re ported at the close of fqg previous year. The amount paid on the p.,bhc debt during the fiscal year ended June to, ISSS, was $45.993,23543. and riie-c hjs been paid since that date and up to FsOvCigber 1, ISSS, the sum of 8369,828, leaving ti„ v tj;onnt of the debt at the last named date 5 1 T475.86°47- There was however, ,U that time in the treasury applicable to the gcuc,a! purposes of the govern ment the sum of 866, if £,202.38. The fatal receipts for the current f/scat year,: ending June jo, 1880, ascertained to October 1, 1 883, a4 estimated for the remainder of the year, are 8315.000,- j 000. Ihe expenditures, ascertained ■j and estimated, for the same t'nie are o 000, leaving a surplus at the g j close oi year estimated at 570,- ,t 000,0 o. 0 THE 'lAh.tfP. After a summary statement of tiio rev ■ enues anil expenditures of the govern ment a, ul of some of the principal sources of j-ev.ct.u£, the message continues: 1 The fact that oul revenues are in ex , cess of the actual needs ol an e*oao;£jcaJ I administration of the government just lies a reduction in the amount exacted t from tUo peoj.to for its support. Our 9 government is bat th.o established ■ by tiie will of a free people, by wii-cj-: Aciram principles are applied which they 1 ■ have adopted In. their benefit and pro tection; and it is neve; bet to. a/fjpjnis -1 tered and its true spirit is uc.ver bette, ' observe 1 than when the people's taxa. tion for its support is scrupulously limi ted to the actual necessity of expendi tures and distributed according to a just ami e..i;;table plan. ’Hie prop isitii,!; with which we have to deal is the rednotjo.w <. t“e revenue received by the government and qirUGtly paid by the people from customs duties. 1 ’t he question of free trade is not involv ed, nor is ti f e;e now any occasion f r the general discussion f,ho wisdom or ex pediency of a protective ay.ai-e^. Justice and fairness dictate that ;u any modification of our uresent Jaws relating to rev. nue the industries and interests which have been encouraged by such laws and in which our citizens have large investments should not be ruth ] leasly injured or destroyed. We should also aeai with the subject in such man ner as to protect the interests of Ameri can labor, which Is tog caoital of our ! workingman; its stability and j,qror re mw negation furnish the most Justiciable i pretext f</f a protective policy. Within ! these limitations a certain reduction should he made in ou.- customs ypycaue. The amount of such reduction friths been determined, the inquiry follows Whore can it be best ho remitted ami what articles can best be released from duty in the interest of our citizens? I think the r. dilution should be made in the revenue derived from a tax upon the imputed nc cessaries of life. We thus directly lessi n the cost of living in every family in the land and retale to the I people in every humble home a larger measure of the rewards of frugal indus try. civil, service reform, i The President speaks ot civil service j reform: “The report of the Civil Sirvico Com mission, which will be submitted, cou j tains an account of the manner in which the civil-service law has been executed during the last year, and much valuable information on this important subject. “1 am inclined to tlduk that there is no sentiment more general in the minds of the people of our country than a con viction of the correctness of the principle upon which the law enforcing civil ser vice reform is based. In its present con dition the law regulates only a part of the subordinate public positions through out the country. It applies the test of lituess to appf'eauts for these places by means of a‘competitive examination, and gives large discretion to the commission ers as to the character of the examina tion and many other matteis connected with its execution. Thus the rules and regulations adopted by the commission have much to do with the practical use fulness of the statute and with the re suits of its application. “The people may well trust the com mission to execute the law with perfect fairness and with as little irritation as is possible. But of course no relaxation of the principle which underlies it and no weakening of the safeguards which sur round it can he expected. Experience in its administration will probably sug gest ameudm-lit of the metliuds of its execution, but I venture to hope that we shall never again he remitted to the sys em which distributes public posi tions purely as rewards for partisan sei vice. Doubts may well he entertained whether our government could survive tne strain of a continuance of this sys tem. which upon every change of admin istiution inspires an immense army ot claimants for oiliee to lay siege to the patronage ot government, engrossing the lime of public officers with their oppor tuuities, spreading abroad the contagion . of their disappointment and tilling the ’ air with the tumult of their discontent. ‘ The allmen e its ol an immense mini ’ her of offices and places exhibited to the i voters of the laud, and the promise ol , their bestowal in recognition of partisan activity, debauch the suffrage and rob political action of its thoughtful aud de -1 lihrative character. The evil would iu etcase with the multiplicatiou of offices consequent upon our extension, and the mania for office holding, growing from its indulgence, would pervade our popu latiou sogenerally that patriotic purpose, the support of principle, the desire for I the public good aud solicitude for the nation's welfare would be nearly ban . ished from the activiiy of our party con ’ tests aud cause them to degenerate into ignoble, seltisb and disgraceful struggles 1 for the possession of office and public place. r •’Civil-service reform enforced by law came none too soou to check the progress of demoralization. One ot its effects, not enough re ■ garded, is the freedom it brings to the [ political action of those conservative aud j sober men who, in fear of the contusion and risk attending an arbitrary and sud den change in all the public offices with L a change of party rule, cast their ballots J against such a change. : ‘ Parties seem to be necessary, and will long continue to exist; nor can it be | now denied that there are legitimate ad * vantages, not disconnected with olhce > holding, which follow party supremacy. 1 While partisanship continues hitter and 1 pronounced, and supplies so much of mo tive to sentiment and action, it is not fair to hold public officials, io charge of ’ important trusts, responsible for the hi s’ ‘ results in the performance of their du • ties, and yet insists that they shall rely, in confidental and important places, upon the work of those uot only opposed to them in political affirmation, but so steeped in partisan prejudice and rancor that they have no loyalty to their chiefs and no desire for their success. Civil ■ service reform does not exact this, nor f does it require that those in subordinate positions who fail in yielding their best . service, or who are incompetent, should be retained simply because they are in place. The whineiug of a clerk dis charged for indolence or incompetency, who, though he gained his place by the worst possible operation of the spoils system, suddenly discovers that he is 1 entitled to protection under th i sanction 1 of civil-service reform, represents an idea no less absurd than the clamor of the applicant who claims the vacant po sition as his compensation for the most questionable party work. The civil-ser vice law does ifot prevent the discharge nf the indolent or ipeompetent ejerfc, but it does prevent supplying hjs place with the unfit party-worker, Thq?, in both these phases, is seen benefit to the pub lic service. And the people who desire good government having secured this statute, will not relinquish its benefits without protest. Nor are they unmind ful of the fact that its full advantages can only be gained through the complete good faith of those having its execution in charge. And this they will insist upon. I recommend that the salaries of the Civil Service Commissioners be iu creased to a sum more nearly commensu rate to the if* important duties.” 4* Eb’hEi-TIVE NA > * After referring to the Dolphin depute and the ](>aoh trouble the President says: “All must admit th? importance of an effective navy to a 4 nation like ours, having such an extended soacoast to pro tect, and yet we have not a single vessel of war that could keep the seas against a first class vessel of any important power. a £oU.4i£ioo ought no longer to continue.

The fact that within £;■<?(( teen ■ years more than seventy-llve millions ol * dollars have been spent in the construe - lion, repair, equipment and armaments 1 of vessels a4 the further fact that in , stead of an 0ft061i,6 creditable licet, we have only the dUpouUint gj;il appre -1 heusion of a nation undelended by war L vessels, added to the disclosures now made, do not permit us to doubt that every attempt to yevive our navy has thus, for the most part, misdirected. All onr efforts iti that direction have been little better than blind gropingg, and evoyusive, aimless follies ” Thii I recoin mciiil tbu passage of a jaw an tborir.lug the appointment of six eomrais siouers, three of whom shall he detailed from the army, to ho charged with the duty if a careful inspection from time to time of all the Indians upon our rcserva tions or Hubyec. 1,. care and control of the {pivei nmeut, with a view of y.sso.ey ing their exact condition and neetls and 1 determining what steps shall bo taken on behalf of the government to improve their situation in jdf.s 4-rectpn of I heir self-sup port and com pieto .civipzatiOfj, tj-at they ascertain from such inspection jviiaf, any, ol the reservations mav h.e reduced in area, and In simh eases what part, not ue sleii for Indian oeenpatiun, ujay ehaseil by tlie government from the It., diaus and disposed of for their lienei t what, if any.

The powers and funution. of Lite coiniiiissioners in regard to these sub jects should lie clearly defined, tl ough they should, in oonjiiiieiion with the Secretary of the Interior, lie given all the authority to deal definitely with the questions pre sented deemed safe and consistent. 

.SILVER AND GOLD. This hoarding of go’d lias already begun. When the time comes that gold Las beeu withdrawn from circulation, ’ben will lie apparent the difference between the real value of the silver dollar and a dollar in gold, and the two coins will part company. Gold, still the standard of value and neces sary in our dealings with other countries, will be at a premium over silver; binks which have substituted gold for the de posits of their customers may pay them with silver bought with such gold, thus making a handsome profit; rich speculators will sell their hoarded gold to their neigh bors, who need it to liquidate their foreign debts, at a ruinous premium over silver, aud the laboring men and women of the land, most defenseless of all, will dud that the dollar received for the wage of their toil has sadly shrunk in its purchasing power. It. may be said that the latter re sult will be but temporary, and that ulti mately the price of labor will be adjusted to the change, but even if this takes place the wage-worker cannot possibly gain, but must inevitably lo*e, since the price he is compelled to pay for his living, will not only be measured in a coin heavily depre ciated and fluctuating and uncertain in its value, hut this uncertainty in the value of the purchasing medium will be made the pretext for an advance in prices beyond that justified by actual depreciation. THE MORMON QUESTION. After a strong and long reference to the Mormon question of the President says; “There is no feature of this practice or the system which sanctions it which is not op posed to ah that is of value in our institu tions. There should be no relaxation in the firm but just execution of the law now in operation, aud 1 should be glad to ap prove such further discreet legislation as w;ill rid the country of this blot upon its fair fame. Since the people upholding pol>- gamy in our territories are reinforced by immigration from other lands, I recom mend that a law lie passed to prevent the importation of Mormons into the country.*’ 

DUTY. After a reference to the present condition of the law relating to the succession to the Presidency in the event of the death, dis ability or removal of both the President and Vic -President the message cot.eludes as follows: “In conclusion I commend to the wise care and thoughtful attention of Congress the needs, the welfare and the aspirations of an intelligent and generous nation. To subordinate these to the narrow sdvantages of partisanship or the accomplishment of selOsb aims is to violate the people’s trust aud betray the people's interests. But an individual sense of responsibility on the part of each of ns and a stern denomination to perform our duty well must give us place among those who have added in their day and generation to the glory and pros perity of our lie loved land.’’ A Sad Career. The divorced wife of a Bonanza million aire recently came to a mournful death principally from taking chloral, which un settled her mind and demoralized her whole physical system. She had been weakly ami ailing and felt her need of sometiug to drown her sorrws and brace her up. Had she taken Brown’s Iron Bit ters she would have been invigorated so that she could have fought her sorrows off, and enjoyed life.
