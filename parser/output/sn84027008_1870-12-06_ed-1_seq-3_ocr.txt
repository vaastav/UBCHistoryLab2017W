Referring to tho proclamation of tho Republic of France, he says that, should the present struggle result in attaching the heart of tho French tn tho simpler forms of a Republican Government, it will bo a subject, of still further satisfaction. The American pcoplo should not he indiffer? ent to tho spread of American political ideas in n great and highly civilized conutry Uko France; that if au opportu? nity for interposing tho good nflices of tbe United States in restoring peaco shall present itself, that action will bo heartily taken.

With regard to th currency, tho President says tho ar. preach to a specie basis is very gratify ing, but tho instability of tho currone is very prejudicial to prosperity, ll thinks tho time has arrived when, by wise and prudent legislation, Congres should look to a polioy which wool placo tho currency ut par with gold at u distant day. With regard to revenue r< form, ho says if it means to keep th reveuuo down to what is necessary fe tho support of tho Government and pa; maut of interest on tho public debt, has his hearty support; but. if it mear failure to provide tho necessary means I defray all expenses of tho Governraen ho is opposed to it. llovenue reform, 1 says, has not boon defined hy its adv> cates; it seemed, however, to ho accepte as something which was to supply cvei man's wauts, without any cost or effo on his part.
