It it just the time for improvement and vig orous intellectual advancement. Leisure not necessajiljr another nima for laziness convenient place and with commendable teal labor most earnestly to vanquish their adversaries at euchre and com* out a trick or two ahead. This may kill timo, but really that is all it docs do. Winter is tho lecture season and if wo cannot afford to hire professional lecturers, we submit we are not compelled to do so and if we try can obtain twenty gentlomen who would prepare and deliver lectures to our citizens mora instructive, if not more interesting, than the hackneyed efforts of these professionals. Wc advise our young men to form a lecture association and see if this thing cannot be accomplished. We guaranty success and rich roward for the effort. Are wo to have no Lyceum this winter. What if the Senate, with its complicated machinery, did prove a failure, it does not follow as a consequence, at all, that an old fashioned debating society, will not suc- ceed. It moat certainly will succeed and bo a profitable enterprise on tho part of our young men. Let reading circles be estab lished and let some young gentlemen or lady be selected to entertain tho company by reading choice extracts from our best poets and prose writers. If no young gen tleman or lady can bs found choose soma old one to take their place. The long winter erenings can be mado the most pleasant and profitable season of the year. The money worse than squandered evory month In beer and biiliard saloons and in paying for poor fiddling and Merry Andrews" would furnish all our citizens three even ings in each week, with profitable amuse ment attended with practical advantages of a superior character. We hope that this matter will bo attended to. It is a big thing." It is cheap and tho profits of the enterprise will in no way be affected bv tho money panic. Wo ought to :ultivate our braimafor if property depreciates much more it will se what we know and not what we have got that will enable us to get a living. DISUNION. The programme of South Carolina is to So cede from the Union at all hazards. She may and propably will havo the co operation of other Southern State*. It will now be for the poople to dispose of this question, and fairly decide it with all its grave responsi bilities. Can the Uuion last? It must. Can it stand with piofit to all tho sections It should. It has doveloped the greatnem of all sections, and it only requires a little honest devotion to correct principles, to continue the country in thi* career of pros perity. Wo at the the North have to deal with one class of these agitators. W must put them down, by calling together every con servative citizen, and asking their united co operation and assistance. It may bo the thread to lead us out of this labarynth will be here, at the North, to unite in support or the administration of Abraham Lincoln, if it should be wise and conservative. If how ever it falls into the hands of extreme men and used for fanatical agitation, then to Concentrate all tho opposition against it. CONGRESS IN SESSION. The. Congress of the United States met on Monday Last and proceeded to business, The telegraph brings tho news that the Southern members are all early on hand ready and willing, likotrue patriots, to draw their mileage and compensation with eo roendable regularity and promptness. It •cams that they propose to make the most of the Union while it lasts which is all right enough and we hope it will last, and that the troubles now upon us will develop a wise, conciliatory and conservative spirit among the true men North and South. If the country could be brought back to the policy of ten years ago, even, it wo prove of incalculable relief to all. There is not citizen, not a lollar of property in this whole Union, but have interests deeply and irrevocably connected with the permanency Oil the Government. This fi'iancal storm brewed" by political agitators in I860, has in moat unmistakable terms proved this. In tbiahour oTpanie and doubt as to the future we North and South are loudly admonished to change our past policy and condemn the agitators, who for the hope of some petty filcial position will endanger personal se curity, depreciate j.rorerty patriotic conservatism. Tho long winter evenings before us, if unconditional repeal of all laws and parts of laws enacted by Northern Legislatures properly employed will provo a mo«t marked advantage to all but it is nevertheless true, that nothing in tho right direction has yet been done. A tow of our young men who go in on their shape and can hop, skip and jump evor the musical bars of some itinerant fiddler, who baa not gone to join his companions •round the warm fires in future prepared for all fiddlers, think that they have gone and done it, by getting up a generous lot of cotillon parties.

This is no time for crimin ation and re-crimination, but far earnest W A CAN DONE! The Ohio Stitetman says: It is in tho power of the conservative masses in the North to remove that cause and save the country from tho impending ruin. That cannot be done by unauthoriz ed assurances of the South that the admin istration of Mr. Line ln will be conserva tive. It can only be done by such action as will demonstrate, beyond all cavil, that a majority :n the Northern States are deter mined to abide by tho Constitution and maintain the Union. This determination should be manifested by an immediate and nullifying the Fugitive Slave Law, or in any way obstructing its execution. Such laws are in direct and palpable violation of the Constitution, and Northern, men cannot call upon their Southern brethren to observe the Constitution and remain in tho Union. The demand is therefore urgent and pres sing upon all Democrats and conservative men in the north, that they ahould lay aside all past differences that may havo sep arated them on minor questions, and unite so as to form a public opinion, that shall cause an immediate repeal of the obnoxious and unconstitutional laws in derogation of the rights of the South, restoro harmony and prosperity to the country, and insure the permanency of the Union. ONE O E UU.UOR8 O E ELECTION—PAYING A E WHEELING A NECUO. The Worchostor (Mass.) Times of the Oth, snys: While tho eluction was ponding, Mr. Otis F. Riiggles, of Fitsburg, Superintendent of the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad, agreed with Mr. B. of the firm of Brown Se Allen, dry-goods dealers, that if Mr. Thay er was elected to Congress he would roll a well-known negro in Fitsburg, called 'Dr. Franklin," on a wheel-barrow, from Fits burg to Leominster and, on tho other hand, if Mr. Baily was the sucessful candidate, Mr. B. should do the same. In accordance with that agreement Mr. Brown carried out his part of it yeslorday. At one o'clock, I*. M.» the negro was on hand, dressed appropriately for the occa sion, weighing one hundred and forty-five pounds strong. Mr. Browa and tho wheel barrow were also there, both hardly weigh ing as much as tho negro, and with a largo crowd to sec the sport, the wheel-barrow started from the American House, and was pushed bravely towards Leominster. The crowd cheered and comforted Mr. Brown as far as South Fitsburg, from which place he trundled the negro with only Mr. Kugglcs and a friend, to ace tho thing out. followed behind with a pair of horses. Just before reaching Leominster, a party from that placo, preceeded by the Leominster Band, met Mr. Brown and gave him an konorah'o escort to town, which he reached at half past throo, having been but about two hours on the road. This is ono of the humors of the campaign, which all parties can enjoy—save, perhaps, tho party who does the work. Charleston, Nov. 20,1SG0. United States Marshal Hamilton to-day mailed his resignation. The opinion prevails that ex-Senator Bhctt will head tho ticket from the Charles ton distiict to tho Convention. To-morrow is the appointed day of fast ing and humiliation and prayer, in view of the crisis, and it will bo generally observed. Mr. Keitt arrived in the city, to-night at ten o'clock. A large procession of citizens, headed by a band, marched to tho Charles ton Hotel to serenade him. Mr. Keitt, arrived in the city, to-night at ten o'clock. A large procession of citizens, headed by a band, marched to tho Charleston hotel to serenade him. Mr. Keitt responded in a most eloquent and fiery speech. He said that South Carolina was pledged by every solemn obligation to go out from the federal Union. Thrco weeks ago she had elected on that issue a Logislatuio which unani mously recommended a seperate action. It was infamy to retrace the step. Out of his district—Orangeburg—he could say that of the sixteen hundred votes polled not oho would be for submission. In Colle ton, Beaufort, Barnwell, Pedee, and even in the up country, poople were ::nit on this question. He closed amid gtoat applause. E A I E O E SOUTH The Republicans begin to appreciate tho alarming state of things at tho South. The New York Times [Republican) thus mences an elaborate article: "Whatever mere partisan politicians may say.no reflecting man can dismiss the se cccsion movement at the South as of trifl ing consequence. In spito of prejudice, all are compelled to acknowledge that it is a great popular movement—impressive on ac count of its unanimity and evident sincerity, and important by reason of its bearing upon the destinies, social and political, of our common country." The Tim's thussketchos public sentiment in South Carolina and other States: "In South Carolina all party lines seem to be obliterated. There is but o»e party in the State—but one cortainly that ven tures to declare itself before tho people— and that is the party committed to acces sion. In other States the public voice is not so unanimous, but the secession feeling secmc. nevertheless, to havo thorough con trol of tho public mind. In this respect, it must be confessed, tho aspect of affairs is much more threatening than it was in 1832, Then, even in South Carolina, there was a Union Party strong enough in numbers to dispute tho supremacy with the nullificrs, and ready to take tho field in arms and put down by force any attempt to subvert the Constitution of the country. And in every other southern state the Union feeling was overwhelmingly predominant. Nothirg of this sort is visible now. Tho I aii« ojver the general burrent of public sympathy in all for service.

HOW I E N iO O E If there be a thirteenth labor of Hercules —it consists in putting a child to bed. If there be a fourtceuth-it is the childs leso lution to go to bed. And not having livod over a hundred and fity years since we were a child ourself, we venture to affitin that the fourteenth is harder than the thir teenth by several degrees. We remember how we pleaded for ten minutes more—how we turned conversation into lively and mirthfnl channels, endeavor ing to divert the venerable minds of our pro genitors so that they might not look at their inexorable watches-how, when the nurse maid was left alone with us vice pro genitors gone out to a grown up tea, wc sur reptitiously turned back the hands of the clock precisely one hour, climbing upon tho mantle piece for that purdose to tho eminent hazard of our cervical vertebrao-and also, how that clock, attempting a base imitation of Gen. George Washington said "I cannot tell a lie!" and struck eight at the customary dreadful hour, though the hands pointed at seven. Mr. Benjamin Franklin! wo call on you to do that thing, and confess manfully that if you did sajf ,:early to bed" in your later years, you invariably kicked like a Trojan when that thing wi tried on you in your earlier ones. .Any body, therefore,who render the dread ful emergency known as going to IMJ some thing to be met by youth with fortitude and cxitacy, has conferred a blessing on tho whole human family in genoral-on pucrifer ous families in particular.

LAUGHABLE A laughable incident happened at one of our leading theatres, tho otm»r night, which seriously compromises the reputation of ono of the cleverest members of the Metropoli tan corp$ drama lique. In one of the spectacles now being played, it is necessary to havo an elephant, and as a genuine live ono was not to be had, it was necessary to improvise one, and Mr. who we shall call Tom, was selected to do tho forelegs ol tho beast, and move his eyes and ears. Tom is ovor-fond of his glass,and in this instanco a happy thought struck him, but as the sequel will show, it proved dis astrous to poor Tom. Towards the closo of the performance the audience began to observe that the ele phant was very unsteady in front-but no particular attention was given to tho fact until poor Tom unablo longer to keep his balance, gave^ out entirely, and pitched headlong into the orchestra-stall, carrying his sober posterior with him.

RARITY OF CRIME IN SOUTH CAROLINA.— A corresponent of tho Ne York Times writes as follows from South Carolina: The peculiar criminal laws of the State ronder crime of raro occurrence. Whcro the penalty of thft is either tho whipping post or hanging, there will, of course, be but few thievos. There is no Penitentiary or S*ate Prison of any kind and while every district has its jail, the most of them are said to be untenanted. Tho sessions of the Criminal Courts generally last but a few days and and on sentence day the culprits, whites as well as blacks, are taken to tho whipping-post, and if tho sentence is a se vere one, only a portion of tho stripes are administered, the balance being kopt hi store for a future day. E PItESlDECiT A N ^SECESSION. WASHINGTON, NOV. 23—The position of the President is understood to be, that though tiic South has just ciin^c of complaint against the North.no Stato is justified in re sorting to revolutionary movements until every Constitutional measure for redress has been exahuated. N Stato has a right to commit acts having the effect of precipita ting such a state of affairs as would induce or compel other States to join hor in the disruption of the Union, and the calling of a dispassionate deliberation of the people may result in restoring confidence and preserve the integrity of the Constitution. It is apprehended then that tho question of secession will have to bo practically dealt with by the presont administration. It is stated from a distinguished source that South Carolina secedes as soon as the Con vention so resolves. The coat of a horse is tho gift of nature That of an ass is often the work of a tail or. GKN. LANE.—Gen. Lane, in reply to the call of friends, has written a letter in which he reviews the causes which havo led to the present deplorable state of things at the South.

SECESSION ITEMS. Col. Walter Gwynn, agraduato of West Point, who has served fourteen years in the U. S Army, is in command of the South Carolinian military company, called the Port Hill Guards. They number eighty seven muskets. Tho South Carolinian, under the head of '•Spartanburg Wide Awake," reports the proceedings of a fiery public meeting in that locality. Simpson Bobo, Dr, Padgwtt, and others mvlo secession speeches. Dr, Pad gett is a North Carolinian, who stopped on his way to Raleigh, to express disgust at the anti disunion sentiment of hi3 own State, lie promised to secede and join South Carolina in case she comes to blows. CCTGOV. Letcher, in a recent letter says We have now in Virginia duly and le gally organized, eighty eight troops of cav alry, twenty-six companies of artillery, hundred and nine companies of infanti,, ami one hundred and ten companies of rifle- WASHINGTON, NOV. 20, 18G0. Among the enemies of the Union none sources tho facts as they reach here, authen ticated by men who havo no interest in ex a in them, and are above the suspicion of misapprehension. It is not denied that, oven in the cotton States, there are very many persons devo ted sincerely to the federal Union but these havo unfortunately been forced to the con viction that the North never will cease from their aggressions.and that as separation must come sooner or later for the safety and honor of tho South, now is as favorable a time to consummate it as they can expect. The real or effected doubters may now be assured that disunion is steadily contempla ted by many cautious and careful observers here from the South as not only probable, but as the result of the present troubles.— They are willing, nay, anxious, for a general Convention, and for calmly laying before the Northern Legislatures their grcivanccs and their claims of repealing the obnoxious legis lation so injurious to Southern rights. But they entertain no hope that the conservative men of tho republican States will havo in fluence enough to procure a repeal of those obnoxious laws, and there can be little doubt that, upon a refusal of so rcasonaMo a de mand, the sentiment for secession will be strong and general, even in tho border slave holding States. Now, anticipating tho ob stinate refusal on the part of the republican States,the secessionists think there is no use in shutting their eyes to tho inevitable issue. They calculate that Delaware any Maryland, on this side of the Potomac, will go with the South, and Washington will be tho seat of government of the new Southern confedera cy. They look to peaceablo separation, brought about by regular compact, and on ututally equitable conditions, with the gen eral government. A distinguished Southerner happily quo ted tho famous remark of the Spanish Am bassador to the Due do Broglie, "We shall have the ordinance without ems-iie, et tin coup d'etat sans revolution." The cry through the North, therefore, ought forthwith to be, "Repeal of all laws hostile to the South." South Carolina will make no declaration of independence like that which has been published, nor any other, but an ordinance withdrawing from the Union. The President's Message is ready, and a fair copy has been made, but it may'bo mod ified by occurrences between this timo and the opening of Congress. 

GENEROSITY O I A A E E In tho year 1787, there was a destructive fire in Boston, in consequence of which many of tho in habitants were reduced to want.— Tho Marquis Lafayette, who was then in Frar.ce,lhaving heard of the calamity imme diately wrote to his friend Samuel, Breck, of Bokton, expressing his smypathy for the sufferers, and directing him to draw a bill on him for £300, to be applied toward their reliof. The bill was accordingly drawn, and the money was received, and applied accor ding to his directions. Mr. Breck's son still preserves this letter as a precious memorial of the philanthropy and American feeling of Lafayette. Lafayette was indeed distinguished for this American feeling throughout his whole life. His only son bore tho name of George Washington, and his two daughters were called Carolina and Virginia. A NOVKLTT I N PAPER MANurACTPRB.— The proposition of manufacturing paper from the alfae-a plant which grows wild in large quantities throughout tho whole territory of Algiers, is under serious consideration by the French government. A report made by ministerial command upon the subejet, and which the Paris Monitucr has made public, seems to have been highly satisfactory, and a commission is about to bo nominated for visiting the colony, in order to determine to what extent the government can engage in protection of the speculation, and above all to choose between the plant thus proposed and the palm and aloes leaf, both of which have already been tried and have proved themselves worthy. The treaty of com merce, by withdrawing the prohibition on the importation of rags, has rendered an other substitute in the manufacture of paper an absolute necessity. The pulp procured from the alfie appeal to have the best claim to preference, inasmuch as, it has been in uae for some time past as the great Paper mills of Echareon, and no complaint has been made of the paper being at a'l inferior in quality to that made from rags. It is found much more advantageous to import the pulp of the alfic than the plant in its natural state —the expense of carriage being mnch less, and the length of the journey not great enough to cause fermentation. The only fault at present discovered i« that of hard ness, which produces a dry, brittle quality of paper, not unlike that procured from rice but for printing this is considered of little consequence, and to the people who have been accustomed to the soft, tinder-like ma terial on which are printed the French journals, of such loose texture that the ink sinks so deeply that the characters aro scarcely more legible than if printed on blot ting paper, will appear rather an improve ment than otherwise.—Printer. 03rTh Wags have found put the wayto settle the "irrepressible conflict" without coming to blows. Ono asserts the best way to "fire a Southern heart," is to make love to a Southern belle, and another says the "cotton region" may "be precipitated into a revolution" by marrying her.—Louisville Journal.

W liave been very much gratified with upon tlio political topics of this day Unlike Daddy Shields, of the State, who went soul and breeches into tho pocket of tho slaveholders, Judge Douglas takes a manly and tenable stand that the consti tutional election of Mr. Lincoln by a ma jority of the American people, is no cause for secession or disunion, and so long as both branches of Congress and the Judiciary arc in the hands of tho friends of the South, in fact in the hands of the South itself, all this cry of secession is hollow and unnc-es sary. lie cannot see, from any point of view,' any cause for tho present excitement at the South. This letter will do more to place Judge Douglas favorably before tho people than anything else ho has given birth to for a series of years. Wo shall pubiish it to morrow. We clip tho abovo from the St Paul Tlm% a Republican paper, Judge Doug las' letter which we published last week, contained the same sentiments that he has always held and which the Republican press has been steadily denouncing. No after election they can afford to do him jus tice. In tho hour of peril they look to him or relief. AN HOU WIT 

LINCOLN. Under the above head a correspondent of the Ne York Evening Post, makes some very interesting statements from which we extract the following: I mentioned that Mr. Lincoln had al ready quite a large correspondence with the South. There are many of his letters from that quarter which the country ought to sco. Missives which no decent man could write are abundant their postmarks reveal tho fact that the vocabulary of Billingsgate is not confined to tho Five Points and Marshal Rynders' office. Unfortunately, the remarks of some of them show that their writers arc not devoid of education, if destitute of de cency. Letters threatening death, in all its forms, as the penalty of his high position, are more abundant still. They are, of cousse mainly anonymous, though a few bear real names. Some are signed in hieroglyphics, said to bo known only to the "Saered Or der" or "Southern Brotherhood," which threatens Mr. Lincoln with a sudden and untimely taking off. A few are ornamented with sketches of executions by'tho gibbet, assassination by the stilletto, or death by a lightning stroke and in nearly all the the ology of the writers is indicated by rude car icatures of the Dovil, ready with his prong ed fork to receive and pitch into everlast ing fire the body of the unfortunate Lincoln, whose offense consists in the belief that hn man slavery is wrong. He is not, I am glad to say, annoyed by these. Assured that no man who will write anonymos and threat ning letters is, worthy of being feared, he tosses all such aside as he says, to illus trate, at some future day, the comical side of his administration. Tho rush for office has already commenc ed. While 1 was with Mr. Lincoln he handed me a a note from a gentleman from an adjoining Stato who was exceedingly im portunate for the promise of a certain po sition, as a specimen of many which ho is daily receiving. I may be pardoned for re lating what thousands ought to know: "1 have made up my mind." said he, not to be badgered about those places. 1 have prom ised nothing, high or low, and will not.— By-and-by, when I call somebody to me in the character of an adviser, we will examine the claims to the responsible posts, and de cide what shall be done. As for the rest, I shall have enough to do without reading recommendations for country postmaster ships these, and all others of the sort, I will turn over to the heads of departments, and make them responsible for the good conduct of their subordinates." A A E INEOItSTiTlON. The Chicago Railroad Gazette has the following satisfactory "Answers to Corres pondents: ••HrsTOBiAir."

Rumors are current in Jefferson City that the Governor has ordered the troops to re turn, in consequence of the President having given orders to Gen. Hartley to pursue and arrest Montgomery wherever found. Another probable report is that tho troops will remain in camp for the present, and a small mounted aquad under a competent command, to be sent in the neighborhood of Fort Scott to report to headquarters with all possible speed, the movements of tho troops to be in accordance with the official informa tion brought back. -*. 0^7"IJenry Ward Beecher, on a recent oc casion, said:—"Tho articles of the press go farther than the sermon, and carry with them really more weight: certainly where one hears three a day, which is an abomin ation before God and man.
