Track Tank for Freight Knslnc. The use of track tanks by which lo comotivcs of high speed passenger trains may take water without stop ping is almost universal on the larger Eastern roads, where fast expresses are the rule. The B. & O. It. It. has a number between Washington and Phil adelphia and intends to equip the en tire Main Line in the future. This de cision was recently arrived at through the uss of passenger locomotives, equipped with water scoops, ou fast freight trains. It was found that mucL time was saved, danger from stopping, being reduced to a minimum and cost of running lessened. The extra stops for water take much time and the wear and tear on equipment is no small matter. If the experiment on this part of the road proves sueeessf.il, track tanks will be installed on every divi sion between Baltimore and Chicago. As a starter, the 5l new Vauclain com pound engines recently ordered will be lilted with water scoops. yUr Iff Cot the Kim.
