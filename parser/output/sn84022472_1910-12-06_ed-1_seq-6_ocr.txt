President Tart's message to Con gress Is unconscionably long1 so lengthy in fact that those who read its complete text, will probably be few in number. It Is hardly possible HnrJthln the ordinary editorial limits to ' summarize the entire message, but only to cover those features of cur rent Interest and general importance. He recommends "the passage of a measure by mall subsidy or other sub vention adequate to guarantee the es tablishment and rapid development of an American merchant marine." The estimates of expenditures pre sent, he says, the smallest necessary amounts, though this "does not apply to the river and harbor estimates". Bhould Congress decide to fortify the Panama canal, at an estimated coat of $19,000,000. there will be a probable deficit of about $7,000,000. He recom mends such fortification. He commends the new tariff "as an Income-producing measure", and de clares that the corporate income tax "has worked well". Of the regulations for publicity of corporate returns, he says: I have made It possible for the pub lic generaly to know from an exami nation of the record, the returns of all corporations, the stock of which is listed on any public stock exchange 'or Is offered for sale to the general public by advertisement or otherw'se. The returns of those corporations whose stock Is not ?o. listed or offered for sale are directed to be "open to the inspection and examination of credit ors and stockholders of the corpora tion whose record is sought. The re turns of all corporations are subject to the Inspection of any government officer or to the examination of any court. In wh'ch the return made by the corporation Is relevant and competent evidence. He refers to the tar'ff question with out exnrepsine his own opinion, and rays he hopes "to be able at the open ing of the new Congress, or at least during the session of that Congress, to bring to its attention the facts In regard to those schedules in the pres ent tariff that may prove to need amendment", but urges that tariff revision be limited to "one schedule at a time". He suggests that the present Tariff board be made "a per manent tariff commission"'. He commends the work of the Al dr!ch Monetary Commission thus far, but does not commit himself upon the project of a great central bank. 'The Panama canal will, he says, be completed within the estimate of cost, $375,000,000. He favors a toll of $1 a net ton for use of the canal when opened, and suggests that the govern ment should Include in Its management of the canal the furnishing of dry dock and repair-shop facilities and the sale of coal, oil and other ship sup plies. He also sueeests the enact ment of a law "prohibiting Interstate commerce railroads, from owning or controlling ships engaged in the trade through the Panama canal", as "needed to save to the people of the United tates the benefits of the com petition in trade between the eastern and western seaboards which this canal was constructed to secure". He renews his recommendation of the enactment of "a general law pro viding for the incorporation of indus trial and other companies engaged in Interstate commerce": He also re news his recommendation of "the pass age of a law which shall regulate the isuing of injunctions In equity with out notice in accordance with the best practice now in vogue in the courts of the United States", because it has been promised and "because It will deprive those who now complain of certain alleged abuses in the improper issuing of injunctions without notice of any real ground for further amend ment and will take away all sem blance of support for the extremely radical legislation they propose, which will be most pernicious if adopted, will sap the foundations of judicial power, and legalize that cruel social instrument, the secondary boycott". Postal savings banks "will be opened in some cities and towns on the 1st of January, and there will be a grad ual extension of the benefits of the plan" to the rest of the country". He states that "It would be wise to put p the classified service the first, second and third-class postmasters", although th's would lessen the patron age of Senators and Representatives. The proposition of compellfng maga zines to pay a higher rate of postage on their advertising sections, he says, may promote a reduction of letter post age to one cent. He recommends adoption of the par cels post "on all rural-delivery routes, and that 11 pounds the International limit be made the limit of carriage in such post, and this with a view to its general extension when the Income of the post office will permit it and the postal savings banks shall have been fully established". Some of our navy-yards are "entire ly useless for naval purposes" and the President approves the Navy Depart ment's recommendation that they be abandoned. One of them is at New London. He favors the establishment of a naval station at Guantanomo, Cuba, He recommends that the coal depos its of the government be leased upon competitive bids, with royalties upon the coal mined, with not more than 2.5C0 acres of surface leased to any one lessee; that government phosphate lands be similarly treated, but with power retained to regulate or prohibit exportation; that oil prospectors on government lands be licensed for two years, and leases granted upon rental and royalties and under proper re strictions as to husbanding the supply and preventing monopolistic combina tions; that water power sites be leased upon bids, and suitable rentals, with provisions against monopolistic combi nations. Of pensions, the President states that "care should be exercised not to go to classes of persons who may, at this late day, from a mere mercenary motive, seek to obtain some legal re lation with an old veteran now totter ing on the brink of the grave." Referring to the facts that one-half of the privately-owned timber of the country is held by 200 individuals and corporations and that "there is a very extensive interownership of stock", the President says that this "might lead to a combination for the maintenance of a price that would be very detrimental to the public interest, and would create the necessity of removing ail tariff obstacles to the free Importations of lumber from other countries." "With regard to the eight-hour law, the President, recommends that "the present act . be enlarged by providing that public works be construed to include not only buildings and work upon public eround. but also ships. armor, and large guns when manufac tured in private yards or factories , but that the President be authorized "to declare an emergency in special cases" and in such cases "to permit the payment by the Government of extra compensation for the time work ed each day in excess of elsht hours." On "workmen's compensation", he does not commit himself, but says: . In view of the keen, widespread in terest now felt in the United States In a system of compensation for ln dustr'al accidents to supplant our pres ent thoroughly unsatisfactory system of employers' HaMIity (a subject the Importance of which Congress has al ready recognized by the appointment of a commission). I recommend that the International Conereas on Indus trial Insurance be invited to hold its meeting in 1913 in Washington, and that an appropriation of $10,000 be Trade to cover the necessary expenses of organizing and carrying on the meeting. 1 . With regard to public service cor porations In the district of Columbia, he expresses a hope that Congress will entrust the Dstrict commission ers "with powers similar to those of the public utilities commission of New York or similar boards in Massachu setts." In the matter of civil service retire ment, the President declares "that the simplest and most Independent solution of the problem for both employe , and the Government la a compulsory sav ings arrangement, the employe to set aside from his salary a sum sufficient, with the help of a liberal rate of in terest from the Government, to pur chase an adequate annuity for him on retirement, this accumulation to be Inalienably h's and claimable If he leaves the service before reaching the retirement age or by his heirs in case of death." But he would further pro vide that, in the cases of employes "who are now so advanced in age that their personal contributions will not he sufficient to create theh- annuities before reaching the retirement age", the "annuities shall be paid out of the salaries appropriated for the positions vacated by retirement, and that the difference between the annuities thus granted and the salaries may be used for the mploymnt of efflcint clerks at the lower grades." The President recommends fa rea sonable appropriation to enable the Interstate Commerce . Commission " to proceed with due' dispatch to the val uation of all railroads." He does not recommend any amend ment to the anti-trust law. because: The existing legislation with refer ence to the regulation of corporations and the restraint of their business has reached a point where we can stop for a while and witness the effect of the vigorous execution of the laws on the statute books 'in restraining the abuses which certainly did exist and which roused the public to demand re form. There will be some disappointment over the non-committal character of the President's references to several important matters, notably the tariff, and workmen's compensation. DR. 

THOMPSON IS KEEPING UP WAR ON DEGENERATES Addresses 'Associated Charities Along Lines of the Far mer's Interview Further outlining her plans as originally given in an interview pub lished exclusively by The Farmer, I H. Adeline Thompson addressed a meeting of the Associated Charities yesterday afternoon and impressed upon the women present the need of drastic legislation to protect woman kind against waves of lust crimes,, such as the epidemic disclosed in Bridgeport at present. From her viewpoint as a physician Dr. Thompson outlined the deadly menace which will always exist so long as degenerates are allowed to roam around the streets. The punish ment for crimes such as the one which have recently horrified and dis gusted the city, Dr. Thompson be 'ieves should be unsexing, as a pro tection to both the present and the future generations. Such a law in operation in the course of time would effectually stamp out the breed of de generate?. This law is now in opera tion in the state of Illinois and is un der consideration in many other states. It 13 suggested that a petition be drawn up, to which signatures mav be affixed. Dr. Thompson exonerates most of mankind from the shame of the crimes of which a few human brutes are guilty.

The lamp broke and the burning oil ignited Mrs. Robertson's clothes and spread the flames throughout the room. Hearing her screams. Pastor Ritz man rushed upstairs and attempted to smother the flames upon her. the en tire room then being ablaze. He finaly put out the fire and the ambu lance corps was summoned. Mrs! Robertson was bathed in carron oil and removed to the Bridgeport hos pital. Owing to the terrible nature of her burns her chances for recovery are practically nil. SECRETARY MEYERSRLPORT Favors Abandonment of 8 Navy Yards as Nearly Ue.ess Washington, Dec. 6. A shock such as has seiuom been felt in naval cir cles tollowed the publication of the annual report of Secretary of the .Navy Meyer, In which he proposed the abolition of the navy yards at XSiew Orleans, Pensacola, San Juan, Port Royal, New London, Sackett's Harbor, Culebra and Cavite. By the elimination of these seven yards Mey er said that he ' removed an averagu annual expense for maintenance of $1,672,675. He declared that during the last five years very little useful work had been done in any of the yards named. One new navy yard is indefinitely suggested for San Francisco Bay. Following a discussion of the limita tions of the yards at Mare Island and Bremerton, Meyer said: "I conclude that it will be neces sary to establish a docking and re pair station on San Franciscd Bay n some locality yet to be selected. Such a repair station should include one or more docks of the largest size, for taking our largest existing and con templated battleships." On the other hand Meyer recom mends the further development of the Bremerton yards and enlarge ment of the channel at Mare Island "in view of the fact that a fleet at some time after the opening of the Panama Canal may be based in the Pacific Ocean." Discussing navy yards in general the Secretary said: "The- United States has over twice as many first clas- home navy yards as has Great Britain with a navy at least double the size of ours and we have one more navy yard of the second class than Great Britain has. In other word3 we have in all 11 first and second class navy yards In the United States, while Great Brit ain has but 6 of the same kind. Ger many has 3 and France 5." The Secretary recommends aband onment of the yards at New -Orleans and Rensacola on the ground that they are strategically unnecessary. The Key West station, however. ! o be retained, owing to its geographi cal situation as a base of supply and the fact that it supplements the naval base at Guanianamo. As to the yards along the Atlantic coast Meyer de clares the Port Royar. (S. C.) dry dock unapproachable for battleships or cruisers except at an unjustifiable expense, and the Charleston, (S. C.) dock useless for the same character of vessels owing to the rapidity with which it fills with debris. Since the Porfmouth. Boston, , New York, Phil odelphia and Norfolk yards have ac cessible dry docks for battleships ami efficient repair facilities. Meyer be l'evps It hardly advisable to gie them up. Recommendation is made for. an appropriation of $25,000 with which to conduct experiments covering the use of the aeroplane for naval re connoissance. Commenting on the fisrht mae by Eugene Ely from tho deck of the .ecout cruiser Birming ham Meyer said: "This experiment and the advences which have been made in aviation seemed to demonstrate that the aero plane is destined to perform some, part in the naval war fare of the future. It appears likely that this will be limited to scouting. A scout which is not strong enough to pierce the enemy's line can get as near as possible and then send an aeroplane 3 or 40 miles, obtain valuable in formation and then return to the scout.. Even i the aviator did not land on the scout he could be brought on board and deliver his information. The loss of an aeroplane would oe pf no moment, as the ship may easily carry others. The distinct value of service of this kind is easily seen. "The department contemplates fur ther experiments along these lines with the belief that it will be neces sary in the near future to equip all scouts with one or more aeroplanes to increase the distance at which in formation can be secured." A saving of $4,300,000 in the esti mates for the next fiscal year for th Navy Department is indicated by the Secretary the second year of , cur tailment. Notwithstanding this eco nomy in the past, the Secretary de clares there has been an Increase In the sea-keeping ability of the fleet i of 15 ner cent.: an Increase of 5 nr cent, in the average speed, of20 per cent, in the cruising speed and an increase of 16 per cent, in machinery horsepower. Despite this latter item and the greater mileage of cruisins, the cost of fuel used in the navy has decreased $2,000,000. Singularly enough this decrease is more appar ent, during the latter half of last year than during the former, notwith standing it was in the second half 1hat most of the cruising occurred. The coct of maintenance for each ship ?n commission has shown a decrease over the year before of 2'0.ono. The Secretary asks Congress for legislation establishing the present Meyer re-orea nidation scheme. Tils recommendations in this respect how ever occasioned surprise in naval cir- j cles owing to their being less than ; was expected. It was believed that Meyer would reoueet that the naval aides, who are line officers and ra- olace the old civilian bureau chiefs , t : T7 i ' i ue given luruier executive power.
