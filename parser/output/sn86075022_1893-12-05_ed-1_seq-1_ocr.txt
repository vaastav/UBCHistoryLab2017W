The Hawaiian Buasites Likely to Come Up in Varlous hapes-The Chinese Question Agaln. WAsHINm.ox, Dec. 4.-The extra ses sion disposed of all preliminaries gener ally necessary at the opening of long sessions, and consequently there will not be one of the usual reasons why congress may not begin business promptly upon convening tomorrow. Between fifty and sixty bills and resolutions are on the senate calendar, so that body can begin legislating immediately after the receipt of the president's message. There are a few bills of general importance, such as Hill's federal election bill; the bill re ported by Voorhees to increase the cir culation; Morgan's concurrent resolution for the appointment of a coin com mittee to consider financial questions; Stewart's resolutions, one for a com mittee to inquire it any senators are stockholders in national banks, and the sec#ond relating to the independence of the co-ordinate department of the gov ernment; Petfer's resolution concerning interstate commerce, and Palmer's re garding pensions to non-residents. It is considered probable that none of these will receive as much attention as the Hawaiian question, which is not now be fore the senate in any shape, but which is almost sure to be brought before it in some way before the close of the week. There will probably be very little busi ness attempted tomorrow beyond the re ceipt of the president's message. It is probable the senate will adjourn Thurs day until Monday of next week. In the house. as soon as the decks are cleared, the tariff bill will have the right of way. The extraordinary session showed a pur pose not of eliminating the silver ques tion, but advancing the tariff problem four months on the road to solution. The Wilson bill will be introduced in the house the latter part of the week, probably Thursday. Estimates of the revenue to be deprived from the tariff I bill are completed and will be submitted tomorrow. They show that the detiicit in revenues will be increased to 800,000, 000, which must be raised from in creased internal revenue taxes or an in come tax. Although at one time last week it was practically decided to im pose a tax on the incomes of corpora tions and legacies, it is now almost cer I tain a tax on incomes of over 5,000 will I ha recommamnlall· It may be the Hawaiian affair will cut some figure in the proceedings. A reso lution calling for the papers in the case is almost sure to be introduced, and it might come up in still another way if the news from Hawaii expected via Auckland Dec. 7 should be of a sensa tional nature. Although the extra session succeeded in getting the Chinese question out of the way for six months at least, by ex tending the period of registration that length of time, it promises to come up agaid. It is tbroadly hinted that the Chinese do not intend to register now any more than before the extension of tee law. Exhibits Ialared by WSsw.

I Tortured an Old Man. 

COLL.-ML'S, 0., Dec. 4.-Three men as saulted Daniel Thomas, a farmer and capitalist, living half a mile from this city when he went to his barn this morning, and binding him securely carried him to the house, where Mrs. Thomas., the only other person on the farm, was also seized and bound. Searching the house the robbers found no money. They demanded $50,000,which they said they knew was kept in the house. Thompson told them that the only money he had out of the bank was .25 in his pocketbook. They insisted that there was money in the house, and removing his socks applied lighted matches to the soles of his feet. They tortured him this way for an hour and left, securing only the 825 and a gold watch, and leaving Thom as and his wife bound and with towels tied about their mouths, so they could not give the alarm. It was late in the day when Mrs. Thomas freed herself and arouse the neighbors. They pre both elderly and are serioully injured. Bold Robbers. BELLEPLAINE, Ia., Dec. 4.-At Luzer ine, three miles from here, last night three men entered the Chicago & North western depot and at the point of revol vers compelled Agent Thompson to give up his money. Then they locked him up in the freight house, and when the night operator appeared he met the same fate. Whenever a would-be passenger appeared or a citizen passed he was promptly robbed and locked up until over a dozen men were imprisoned. The robbers fin ally left after having obtained about $00 end the half frozen prisoners were re leased. Women Play at Fooatlli. .AN FRANCISCO, Dec. 4.-Several thousand gathered at Central park this afternoon to witness an innovation on the foot ball field. The game was played by two elevens composed of women, old and young, attired in ab breviated skirts and trousers. The game was under association rules and resulted in a score of two to nothing. The win ning team was known as the "Colleen Bawns," and the vanquished the "Bon nie Lassies." Though the play was rough at times no one was painfully in jured. Do S$w.@,s Ing Before They Diet The story Shat tells of swans singing before death is very old, and of course " founded upon fancy. The idea has bee= brought down from ancient myths. The voice of the swan is extremely harsh and disagree.ible, without a single mu sicai note in it. and no good reason can be found for likening some of the world's sweetest poets to this unmelod'.us voiced fowl. The on'; approach to a vernfcat:un we have ever seen is the foliowing. clipped some years ago from a Virginia newspaper: "A sporting friend, recently returnel from a foray upon the Potomac rive.. uelow Mount Vernon. was the guest ,. a venerable and highly intelligent tad-. who has always lived on the Potomaci. Speaking of the swan. she gave it :i' 'er decided opinion that this bird was in the habit of singing or making a plaintive noise when dying. The reason she gave for entertaining this belief was that on very many occasions in the last 50 years she had been awakened at nigt t by a sweet and exceedingly sad noise, some thing like the tones of a flageolet coming over the water, and that on every sub sequent morning a dead swan was found to be floating on the water or to have been washed ashore."-Pittsburg Dis patch. Charles V. Charles V had epileptic attacks dur ing his youth. He stammered. He re treated to a monastery, where be had the singular fantasy of ceebrating his own funeral rites in his own presence. His mother. Jane of Camile, was in sane and deformed. His grandfather. Ferdinand of Axage. , died at the age of O3 in a state of profound aelaaohol)a. -New York Times. -% Little Br5l's Kaperienrc Sm a Lkight Mr. and Mrs. Loren Treucott are keep ore of the gov. lighthouseat Sand Beach, Mich. and are blested with a daughter, four ~eare old.

They have a singular kind of dance conducted on the greens of country vil lages in Russia. The dancers stand apart, a knotpf young men here, a knot of maidens there, each sex by itself, and silent as a crowd of mutes. A piper breaks into a tune, a youth pulls off his cap and challenges his girl with a wave and a bow. If the girl is willing, she waves her handkerchief in token of as sent. The youth advances, takes a cor ner of the handkerchief in his hand and leads his lassie round and round. No word is spoken, and no laugh is heard. Stiff with cords and rich with braids the girl moves heavily by herself, going round and round, and never al lowing her partner to touch her hand. The pipe goes droning on for hours in the same sad key and measure, and the prize of merit in this "circling," as the dance is called, is given by spectators to the lassie who in all that summer revelry has never spoken and never smiled. New York Ledger. Trees In Japsa Sacred to the Gods. Near every temple in Japan are cer tain trees which are supposed to be pe culiarly loved by the gods and to be sa cred to them. Any one injuring or cans ing to be injured one of them will bring down the wrath of the "kami" or god whose particular property it is. If the trees be injured in the name of any one, the kami avenges himself on that person instead. So when a girl finds that a swain's love has cooled, and she thinks reaage would be sweet, she makes a straw manikin and calls it by his name. If she is very vengeful, she may also make one of her hated rival. At 2 o'clock at night (called the hour of the bull) she rises, and clad in a white night dress only, with high clogs on her feet, her hair hanging loose and crowned with an iron tripod, on which three lighted candles are stuck, she proceeds to the shrine of the patron god of the family.-San Francisco Chronicle. The Electrie Capstan. An expert in railway matters declares that the lay is not far distant when the switching engine will be entirely done away with, its place being taken by the electric capstan. The latter is already in use to a certain extent on some of the Pennsylvania lines. The motor, which actuates the capstan by means of gear ing, runs at the rate of some 1.200 revo lutions per minute, and the gearing mo tor and switch of the capstan are all conu tained in a watertight iron case, the top of which comes flush with the ground. There is a cover to it which is readily re movable, so as to give easy access to the motor for oiling and cleaning. The wires containing the current for the motor are carried through an iron pipe below the surface of the ground, and the switce for starting and stopping the motor is operated readily by the foat of the at tendant in charge of the capstan.--New York Sun.
