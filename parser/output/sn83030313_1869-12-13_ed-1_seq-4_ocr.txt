The United States nnd China-The Unr lingaiue Mission a Mnrress. The relations between the United States and the Chinese Empire, in the ratification at l'ekin of the Burlingame treaty between the two countries, have been placed on a sound footing. The mutual concessions embraced in that treaty will be advantageous to both nations, and especially to us, in view of the new commercial era opeuing upon the world. Already, since the completion of our Paciflc Railroad, such has been the increase in the trade between San Francisco and the great ports of China, and such the increase of the population and commercial demands of our new Western States and Territories, that we can hardly exaggerate the value and import ance, even ten years lience, of the exchanges of the Pacific and the Atlantic slopes of our continent with the eastern flank of Asia, and all the neighboring chains of Oriental islands, especially as half way to the end of the decade we expect the D.irien ship canal to bo in full I operation. Meantime this new treaty opens the new and broad field of China itself to American enterprise, in the introduction of railways, steamboats, telegraphs, mining machinery, &c. The equivalents to China are the first broad recognition by any Western Power of the right of that great empire as an independent nation to the management of its internal affairs ; and, secondly, the protection of the Chinese in Cali fornia. This concession of the right to China of self-government as a civilized Power Is the special object of the Burlingamo mission to the great Powers of Europe. We are grati fied, also, to be able to say tbat England, France and Prussia may be set down as sub scribers to this important concession, and that such being the case, Russia may also be counted as a party to the general agreement. But while the great European Powers have thus from the first manifested their readiness to adopt the liberal policy of the United States, the Burlingame mission has been bitterly opposed by the old British party of merchants, emissaries and adventurers in China, whose policy has been to Indianize that people. This British party have found the game so exceed ingly profitable to foment quarrels with the Chinese, and to call upon the British fleet to bombard, now and then, a city or two, and to levy tribute in the way of damages, that they would like to keep it up. It is just tho game which our Western Indian agents and con tractors and rings have played for so many years with success in filling their pockets at the expensa of the Indians and tho public treasury?tho game which General Grant is happily undermining and superceding, with General Sheridan to manage the fighting Indians, and honest Quaker peace commis sioners to deal with the friendly ones. Our late Minister to China, Ross Browne, with his California prejudices and political affiliations and calculations, and from his igno rance of his business in China, fell an easy prey to this old British party at Shangbae and Canton, and their American allies in Chinese trade and politics, called by the coolies "sec ond chop Englishmen"?the real English being "first chop." Hence tho mischief done for awhUe by Browne in upholding tho policy of the British speculators and adventurers of Indianizing China and in opposing and mis representing fhe policy of his own gov ernment. But the prompt recall of Browne by General Grant, and renewed assurances to the Chinese government of the good f*itb Of the United States touching the Burlingame treaty, have resulted in repairing the mischief done by the "second chop English men" and in securing the ratification of the treaty, which Browne so blunderingly, in tho interests of British adventurers, lubored to defeat. Our new Minister to China, Governor Low, also frton California, is a diplomat who under stands his mission. Fully Instructed, more over, by his government, he cannot make the mistake of Browne, an appointee of Johnson, who assumed the responsibility of acting for himself utter Johnson's retirement from office. The BrilUh party in China, in getting hold of Browuc, played their cardB very adroitly to create t diversion in England against the Bur lingame mission. They induced Browne, in a deliberate letter, to denounce our treaty and the Chinese themselves as semi-barbarians, unfit for equality under international law. Then the Chinese were told that the Bur lingame mission was Involving them in all sorts of trouble, and every foreigner in Pekin was denouncing the mission to the Chinese and the Chinese to every foreign government. But, notwithstanding ull this "noise and confusion" in China, Lord Clarendon sided with Bur lingame; and so England is committed to tho great purpose of his mission?the treatment of China not as a race of barbarians, to be bom barded and plundered on any pretence, but oh a government entitled to the respect due to a civilized and independent State. From the foothold already gained, then, in this direction, we think we may safely assume that the Burlingamo mission is a great success, and that from its good results in the way of peace and trade with China, and the new field opened to American enterprise, the United States will reap a rich harredk, as will all the other ty?tiop coucorpcti. The Abuse of the FraokiM Privilege. The franking privilege enjoyed by Congress has long been justly inveighed against by the entire newspaper press of the country. The system in itself would not bo bo bad or so con damnatory, however, were it not that it li-id0 to such abuses as has drawn upon it uni versal odium. In his eiccellent message to Congress and to the country President Grant assures the people of an administration of economy and retrenchment in all tha dopart ments of the government under his especial charge. It is to be hoped that Congress will keep step with the Executive in this course of retrenchment and economy, and that the first earnest of Us good intentions in this regard will be to abolish the franking privilege alto gether, or institute a reform in the present system which will render impossible the frudS upon the Post Office Department, to which it is now notoriously subject. Tiie abuse of the privilege has gone so flff that not even the semblance of tho autograph of a Representative or a Senator is necessary to frank letters to the most distant parts of the Union. In Washington not one person in a thousand ever slsmps a lettor mailed in the Post Office. It is all the same whether Con gress be sit:ing or not, from the tact that mem bers while in Washington, by moans of engraved stamps, flood tho city with their I autographs, which hold good all tho term of 1 their offices and for years after thoy arc dead?of which there have been instances. Not only mail bags of letters are thus fraudu lently transmitted through the Post Office, hut I tons or Congressional reports and documents and such heavy matter, that is never read, but which involves the Post Office Department in great expanse and cncumbers the mails and often retards their prompt transmission troui I point to point. I Congress, perhaps for want of a little good advice in the matter, has hitherto persistently and contumaciously refused to abolish then privilege of franking letters and Congressional I documents, notwithstanding all the abuses I which we have pointed out as attaching thereto, I and which have never been donied as existing. I Now we propose once more that the privilege I bo abolished, but not without offering a sub stitute in it3 place. Here it is. Let there be 1 a law passed granting to memVera of Congress while engaged in their Congressional duties I postage stamps for all proper and necessary purposes, the Postmaster General to keep a I record of the amount of stamps thus coutrib- I uted by his department, designating the quan- 1 tity allowed to each Representative and Sen- I ator. If Congress is imbued with any of the political wisdom of General Grant, who first I in bis own administration of affairs promises I economy and retrenchment and recommends 1 the sarao much needed policy to the legislative I branch of the government, it will surely move in the matter and act at onco upon our sugges- I tion. With our suggestion the economists and reformers in Congress can once more 1 direct their efforts to the removal of the abuses of the franking privilege. The opponents to I the change must bo lew, as opposition to such J a just and economic measure would assuredly I briug down on members the obloquy and odium I of their constituents. I The change which we here propose in the franking system would embrace aU the depart ments of the government, civil and military. The check to an undue and extravagant use or misappropriation of postage stamps would lie in tho fact that the Postmaster General in his annual report to the President for submission to Congress and the country would be required to make a return of the amount of stamps supplied to each Senator and Representative. In the same way he would designate the amount consumed by tho heads of the various departments, and thus would be insured not only a redress of the present great abuses of the franking privilege, but would show the extent , to which the Post Offico Department would be entitled to credit for its share in the perform ance of the great work of government. tlii- 8ncz Canal?Our Correspondence. In the Herald of yesterday we gave another illustration of onr unequalled enter prise. Our correspondent's letter from Ismailia and from Suez occupied eleven columns of this jonrnal. For exhaustive treatment and lor literary ability it Is only fair to say that this letter has not been approached by anything which has appeared in the shape of correspondence regard ing this subject in any journal either in this country or in Europe. The reproach scornfully flung at American journalism in tho early stages ? of our lata wur that it had not yet developed special corres pondents of any literary ability it has been the privilego and pride of the 

II8RAI.D to wipe out. Our correspondence in tho later years of the war, our letters from Abyssinia, some of our recent letters from Spain, our rycent letters i from India, our correspondence 1 from Constantinople relating to the movements ' of the Empress Eugenie, and now this latest letter from Egypt, have on all hands commanded tho highest admiration and have amply justified our claim to the fore most place in the domain of journalism. It id thus that we lend our powerful influence to delight, iustruct and to improve mankiad. Revolutionary Contaoion?Portcoal, Infected.?a cable telegram informs us that fears are entertained of the breaking out of a rebellion in various parts of Portugal, and that the authorities are active. It is not won derful that such fears should exist. Thou sands of exiled Spaniards are now in that kingdom. It will be well for Portugal, how ever, to await the result of the experiment now being made by her big sister. It is not yet certain that revolution in Spain is to be an unmixed good. jcdoe McCcmn ani> the Repeaters.?a man charged as an election repeater, and detected in plying his game at the late charter election, was on Saturday last brought up on habeas corpus to the Superior Court. Judge McCunn, presiding on the occasion, discharged the accused, volunteering an extra judicial opinion that "it was a practice among police captains to arrest large numbers of men on the charge of repeating merely to prevent them voting at all." There may be very good sophistry in this, but ha<j the Judge's and the maun poljjii;* q9(jiu>k to jo it? tae police captains oome in for a pretty fair share of judicial oriticism these times, but this last savors a good deal of political prejudice. Go on "repeating," boys. The Postponement of the Bcinenletl Council. Ry cable telegram we learn that the Council which met at Rome on the 9th of this month haB adjourned until after Epiphany, or until after the 5th day of January. It is added that much opposition is expected when the Council resumes its sittings. This opposition ib no longer a mere rumor; it is a fact. France has taken decided ground; and the example of France is approved and adopted by all the Catholic governments. The French govern ment has notified the Council that the declara tion of the infallibility of the Pope is re ligiously inopportune, and that politically it nullifies the Concordat and releases France from her obligations to the Holy See. This is a heavy blow. This, however, is not all. The majority of the French bishops are opposed to the infallibility dogma. So, it is oertain, are all the liberal bishops of Germany. We do not wonder that it has been found necessary to adjourn the Council. The Fope, it is said, is somewhat alarmed; but he counts with con fidence on the support of the American bishops. When we remember that the Coun cil of Trent sat at irregular intervals, from 1545 to 1503, a period of eighteen years, and during which the chair of St. Peter had live successive occupants?Paul 111., Julius III., Marcellus II., Paul IV. and Pius IV.?we cannot help attaching some importance to this first adjournment. The end of the Council may be near; but it may bo afar off: and no ono can foreseo its history. ltcturn of th? Bmprew to Parl,. The Empress Eugenie h&s returned lo Paris from her trip to the East. She returns o the seat of her husband'B government crownod with the laurels of success that hare been showered on the colossal enterprise whose completion owes so much to the Erapo rors co-operation and good will. Tho opening of the Suez Canal is a victory that will forever reflect credit upon tho French nation, not only for the perseverance and material support gen erally granted to the scheme throughout the country from its commencement, but to the individual merits displayed by M. de Les*eps in bringing his untfring efforts to a successful termination. Perhaps no better expression can be employed than the words uttered by the Emperor at the recent opening of the Chambers m lans, wherein he alludes to the absence of the Empress: "Tho Empress is not present to-day, because I desired her to testify tho sym pathy of France with tho wonderful genius and perseverance of a Frenchman." Surely no fitter person could have been selected to express such sincere good will than a lady, and, above all, a lady holding the exalted position of the first lady in the land-in fact, the Emperor's wife. The Empress has proved that she is possessed of considerable power of observance and common sense, and many of tho great moral revolutions that will doubtless be recorded in future history in reference to the East will owe their origin to her observations. In the matter of the Suez Canal tho visit of the Empress of the French has made an impres sion upon the people of those distant countries the effects of which will bo more telling and powerful than any conquest offected either by diplomacy or by the force of arms. In sending the Empress to attend the inauguration of an enterprise of such great Importance to the world at large the Emperor has but given another proof of his clear foresight and well poised policy. Judge Dowling and tub Police Commis sionehs. In the Tombs Police Court on Sat urday last Judge yowling made some appro priate and much called for strictures on the police for not bringing up the parties arrested during the previous night for the action of the court. Judge Dowling in his remarks said that he had been in attendance at seven oclock A. M., and it was near nine before the court was placed in a position to dispose of the charge sheets. He showed the great evil accruing to citizens from tho omis sion of duty on tho part of the police, whom however, he did not blame, as they wore sub ordinate to their captains, and they in turn had to obey the orders of the Commissioners. The evils to be redressed are serious to the community. Judge Dowling says he is power less In the matter; but when he once sets his face against a wrong done to tho people coming through his court he is just the man to see it rectified, no matter what are the odds against him. J? Condition of Ireland.?Among our special cable telegrams is one which says that the condiUonof^eland looks alarming to the BritUb government. It has been the main Cabinet th? past week at three Cabinet meetings. Five thousand additional T ! , "ne ar? 40 1)6 Mediately despatched to the island, and portions of Munster and of Ulster are to be "proclaimed" n a state of insurrection. Members of Par .ament will at once ask for power to suspend the habeas corpu9 and to do all other execu tive acts n order to preserve tho authority of aw. When the five thousand additional troops shall have arrived they will swell tho number of British troops in service in Ireland alone to thirty or thirty-two thonsand-that is to say, to nearly half of the entire British foreoi actually in service throughout Great Britain and its colonies. If so largo a pro portion of the British army is needed in Ireland the condition of the Emerald Isle may well look alarming to government. The President's Message and tub Bi.ub ,/T'~^re8ldCIlt Grant'8 message, says the ulifax C hronicle, renders annexation all the more desirable. This Is a common sense view of the situation. Annexation is the manifost destiny of the Now Dominion. Let our neigh bors make up thoir minds to the inevitable. In the Union thoy will have genuine recipro c,fy? Out of it they cannot prosper. Neatlt Said.?The London Spectator of Saturday last, in an editiorial on President J.'anfs message, says that tho programme of l>eace, retrenchment, reconstruction and honesty must enhance the position of the unitpd States as a nation. Her way of pav ing dsbts is the last to ba quarreled with.". We WJ grUefui, bat apt ia*twc|#4. Yesterday's Huiw?. Although our weekly report of the Sunday sermons is briefer it is also more interesting than usual. It will folly satisfy the curiosity of all who wish to kuow what the Rev. Mr. Frothingham had to say about "The Foes of Society," dividing these into two classes? "the hot-blooded foes and the cold-blooded foes"?and pouring torrents of vituperation upon the press; as well as what the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher thinks of Father Hyaclnthe, of the remorselessness of nature, and of the want of sympathy and forgiveness among mankind. It moreover reproduces Father Preston's presentation of the Catholic view of the vexed question of common and denominational schools, and the first of a series, of lectures by the Rev. Dr. David Einhorn on the importance and true mean ing of the reform movement among the Jews. In most of the sermons which we publish it is gratifying to trace the direct influence of the New York Herald on the minds of the preachers. Even those among the latter who, like Balaam, open their lips to curso are constrained to bless a journal which converts their words into "winged words," that shall fly all over the world, immeasurably widening the sphere of their personal influ ence, but, when this 1b dangerous, supplying effectual antidotes for the poison. The Dkibticax Congress at Naples has already proved, according to our special cable telegram, "a dead failure." This Con gress is, in fact, but a political convention of radical "reds," whose personal squabbles among themselves exhaust all the strength with which they might unitedly act against their conservative opponents. The question of the French occupation of Romo is exciting more serious discussion among the deists assembled at Naples than any theological or philosophical question. 

SWINDLES. A Now Wmy of "liaising" the Wind?An ?x> tensive Business In Bridgeport, l!onn.t on Bogus Kecuminendutions?Ton Thousand Dollars' Worth of Goods Awaiting the Owners. About six weeks ago Homo parties arrived in Bridgeport, Conn., and hired the store No. 13 State street, and commenced business as commission mer chants and produco dealers, putting up a sign winch read "W. H. H. Stewart A Sons, Country Produce.?' The/ hired the store lor Ave years and paid a por tion of the rent m advance. They seemed to do con siderable business, and received heavy consignments ! or produce from various parts of tho country. The j beat references were given to parties whose-custom was solicited, and letters and telegrams were re ceived after a while by the bancs and by well known business men or Bridgeport asking about the stand ing of tho Arm of W. H. H. Stewart & Sons, who solicited consignments, and to whom goods were frequently shipped before the shipper troubled himself to make the necessary inquiries. Several merchants doing business at Montrose, Pa., had received circulars and had been referred to tho National Empire Bank, No. 234 Hroadwav, New York. Loiters addressed to this bank were promptly answered, the reply in each case - being written on a sheet bearing a handsomely eugraved head reading, "The National Empire Bank, No. 234 Broadway, New York. Capital fl.ooo.ooo"?witn the names of the I president, directors, Ac. These letters assured the parties Inquiring that "the Arm of W. 11. 11. Stewart liau transacted business at this bank fur a number of years, and was considered perfectly sound." on the strength or this large consignments were made from Montrose to thu Bridgeport Arm. Not feeling perfectly sattsAed, one of tne Moutroso merchants wrote to a friend doing business in Bridgeport to ascertain the raats and inrorin him immediately. Iioing satlsfled on examination mat there wui> an attempt to swindle, the Bridgeport merchant tele graphed to his Triend in Montrose that he wonld do well to como on and see to the matter for himself. '1 tils advice was acted upon, the Montrose merchaut stopping in Now York long enough to discover that no such concern as the "National Empire Bank, No. 2.J4 Broadway," was in existence, on arriving in Bridgeport the Montrose merchant found nis goods untouched, the store having been attached in tho interest of tbo creditors by Bridgeport parties. About $10,000 worth of produce was round in charge or an old man and a boy, who claim to have no knowledge of the principals, and whose duty it I was to receive and ship goouy. Large quantities ol goods have been sent otf from the s..ore, and' many I morj are constantly arriving, showing that tne transactions of the concern ware very extensive. Some eighty barrels of tlour and forty or Afty tabs of butter sent lo this concern are at the steamboat freight oitlce in Bridgeport. Nothing has been seen ot any member or the concern, and no one knows anything about them. They bad in some coses given the names of tao best business men of Bridgeport as references, and also some of the banns, at whicn they did no business aud to whom they were not known at all. They evidently relied upon their ref erences not being questioned, and were successful in many instances. Merchants and shippers of produce from New York city and the West have been at Bridgeport looking ror their goods, which hove in some cases disappeared. It is thought that thcr have l>ecn reshipped by tho parties leit in charge or the store to the members ot tho Arm, aud by tuom sold ot some point safely distant from tlieir base oi operations. The niatter is being worked up, aud may develop some interesting facta. 1c look* as ir a very extensive swindling operation had been nipped in tue bud most opportunely.

VBR818 AND LKTTBBS GATHERED AOAIIC By Jenny 1-erktoa Williams. A glance only at tills little book will satisfy any one that the writer baa genius, hamor and the power of forcible expression. Indeed the intellectual char after or Her mind and style of writing In strength and fores are masculine rather than feminine, and very different from what is seen in tbe Uterarj pro ductions generally of female writers. StUI there is ? vein or deep womanly feeling, flue sentiment and poetry running through the whole of these re gatiiered fugitive pieces. Miss Williams has mora j genius than she is conscious of perhaps, and more than her lusuitlciently studied compositions would indicate to a superilclal reader. Her faults are that she is too independent or neglectful of the rules of good taste In grammar and composition, though It is evident she understands these; that she neglect# ? the mental discipline necessary to Deoome a great 8in0.

Tun History ok Romk. By Theodor Mommsen. Translated by me Kev. William P. Dickson. Wiin a I'relace by Dr. Leonhard Scliinlta. Volume 1. New York: Charles Scribner A Co. The publication or this history of Rome will un doubtedly bo welcomed by every student of history In the United states. It is, so far as we can see la this volume, far superior to Nlebulir's, whose work has hitherto been regarded as the oest on the sub ject. it is true, as Dr. Schmltz observes in his preface, that Dr. Mommsen has possessed the great advantages arising from half a century .of research since Nlebuhr; but, even taking these into considera tion, we still hold the present work in every respect the best. It seems to us that Dr. Moinmsen's investigations were conducted in a more catholio spirit ttian those of Nlebuhr, who belonged to a school ol thinkers tnat delighted in overturning and demolishing old records of the past, whether rounded upon the tnlsty, doubtrul whisperings of traditions or the exaggerated records of facts. And this school, which included such great minds as Nifc buhr and Strauss, with many others of equal promi nence, did not Hesitate at sopnism where positive argument faned it. But not only in Its greater con servatism does Dr. Moinmsen's history excel. Its merits over all others that aspire to recognition as minute and exhaustive histories, resulting from patient research and invesiigatiou, are unmistak ably apparent In every chapter. While agreeing, in the main, with his predecessors regarding the ancient inhabitants of Home, his account ol thein is so clear, so simple, and at the same time so vivid, that there is nothing left for conjec ture and nothing requiring patient study to arrive at a correct understanding or the views held. Ho also in the very exhaustive account ol the political and social condition of the people?the development of the constitution, law, religion, agriculture, com merce, the arts and sciences?we are furnished with a narrative of unsurpassed clearness. Dr. Momm sen, indeed, possesses a literary virtue which few Uer man writers can lay claim to, however loarned and perspicuous they majQie. While neglecting nothing that can in the slighmt degree add to the historical value of the work he lias arranged his materials with remarkaDle skill, framing with them a narra tive at once so animated and so Interesting that the intelligent reader can enjoy It with all the enthusiasm or a young sentimental girl poring over the latest love story. We ao not nesltate to recommend the work as the best history of Home yet writtou. The publication of tho remaining three volumes will not, we trust, be long delayed. Thk Living Whiter* of tiie South. By James Wood Davidson. New York: Carleton, publisher. While we think Mr. Davidson lacking In judgment In including In this book the names of a large num ber of very obscure writers of decidedly mediocre ability we nevertheless recognize tho valuo of his work and Its merit as a literary production. It makes a far more flattering exhibit of Southern lit erature than most persons would have supposed possible. The total number of writers named is 241, of which seventy-live arc women. Precisely one-half of these are writers of poetrv, the most conspicuous names being llayne, Flash, Sims lte quler, ltandall aud a few others well Known to the people or tho Nortn. In Action there are Madamo uc la via I>e Vert. Augusta Evans, Mrs. South worth aud others. History is represented by such names as (iayane, Campbell ana Pollard. Altogether this book show3 very accurately wnat literature the South possesses. Numerous extracts Irotn the wrlt lng* of those referred to enable the reader to rorm a fair judgment of their capacity. As Mr. Davidson hiinscir says, "some of taese specimens ure poor enough, in all conscience, but each In its way and all together have their use In tue general ocsigu " As a book of reference we think this tiie most com plete and accurate of all the works on the subject that have horetoiore appeared. Bassblas, Prince or Abyssinia. By Samuel John son, LL. D., with an introduction by the Rev. William west, B. A. New Vork: Scilbner, Wel ford ft Co. It is hardly necessary for ns to refer to the merits of this book, j Not to have read "Rasselas" at least once during a lifetime is something difficult to imagine of an educated person. The present edition Is one of the charming "Bayard Series" to which we have made reierenoe in former notices.
