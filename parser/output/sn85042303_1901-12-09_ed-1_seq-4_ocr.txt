POOL TABLE POCKETS. They Are ainde I'or tin- Mint Inrt In r'urmrrfc HoiiNt-n, "An odd occupation, surely," said a tnau acquainted with the business, "Is that of knitting pool table pockets. A few persons Hud steady employment nt It, but the greater number of those en gaged In It take it up Incidentally to some other employment. "Of nil the lKiol pockets used the lar gest proportion Is made In farmhouses by farmers' wives mid daughters. The women who do this work are mostly Hermans nnd Swedes. "Pool tablu pockets are all hand made. The largest producer of pool pockets is n concern in New York that employs ut this work about thirty fam ilies, these mostly residing on Long Is land. The bundles of material fot the several families thus employed are made up In the shop and delivered to them, the finished pockets being lit the same time collected. "The knitting Is done with a needlo twenty Inches In length, and tho pock ets are knitted with it peculiar knot that will not pull out. You might cut u hole In n pocket with n knife,' but the hole would go no further. As the pock et Is knitted it will not pull or draw apart. "Pool pockets nro mndo of cotton, of wool and of silk. The first are sold for $1.25 or thorenbouts n dozen. SHI; pockets sell for about $10 a dozen. "I should sny that of all the pockets made perhaps half are of cotton, three eighths of wool and onc-clghtli of silk. The pockets are most commonly green, but they are made In other colors as well In maroon, for example, nud In yellow nnd In blue for tubles with cloths In those colors. "Output? Well, the production of them Is somewhat scattered. I should say that It might amount annually to about 10,000 dozen, valued on nn aver age, roughly estimated, at $4 a dozen, making the total value of the output somewhere about $ 10,000."

ANIMALS IN A STORM. Thej- mxlllif (In- Wot Wcnthrr nml Seel, ii I'liu't- ii( Surely. Doth wild ami tame animals, four footed or with wings, have u deep seat ed aversion to wet weather. Kven wa ter fowl will seek n dry hiding place when It rains. Did you ever watch the actions of cattle before a big storm? If so, you must havo seen them grow more nud more uneasy as the clouds gathered. You nUo saw them run up nnd down the Held, ns If seeking to escape some Impending danger. Plnally, when the storm breaks, they draw close together and with lowered heads present a pic ture of despair. Domestic animals when It rains will always keep Indoors, or, falling that, they will seek shelter by tho barn or under trees or beneath the hedges nnd thickets lu sli.it, In nny convenient plnce where they may not be entirely exposed to the downpour. It Is the same with fowls. They dis like the rain, which sonks their feath ers. They seek sheltered places and creep under wngous or behind boxes nud boards. Chickens do not mind get ting their feet wet, for they will scratch the ground soon after a shower lu search of worms nnd beetles. Wild birds do their best to keep out of the rain. Some of them build n roof over their nests; others choose a homo under the eaves or under a projecting cliff, where they may be safe from the discomfort that tho rnlu brings. Rut most of them nro without shelter provided In ndvapco by their own fore thought. These lake refuge In nny place that they happen to find nt hand. If you watch them before tho storm, you will seo them looking for such a place. If tho storm comes suddenly, tlio small and helpless ones seem be wildered, flying from tree to tree nnd from limb to limb, quite unable to make up their minds exactly where to bide themselves.
