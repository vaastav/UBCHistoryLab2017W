Hadley and Others Consulted, Washington, Dec. 9. The Washington Post to-morrow will say: President Koosevelt has received a letter from Andrew Carnegie in which the latter offers to make a donation of $10,000,000 ' to the United States. The letter will be "referred to congress by the president in a special message. Mr. Carnegie's gift is for the purpose of establishing in Washington a univer sity for higher education. As far aa his Idea has been developed, it proposes a ' gift after the manner of the bequest of James Smlthson, the Englishman who gave $1,000,000 for the establishment and maintenance of what is now known as " the Smithsonian' Institution. Smlthson, desired the institution founded by him to be a factor in "the diffusion of scien tific knowledge." Mr. Carnegie pro poses that the university which he is to endow ehall be the greatest institution in the world Cor the development of higher education. He has consulted President Gilman of Johns Hopkins un lversity, President Hadley of Yale, President Eliot of Harvard. Former President White of Cornell, and all the leading educators of the country. They heartily endorse his plans. The proposed university will not in terfere in the least with the educational Institutions already established, but will supplement them, for, according to the present plans, its doorj will be open only to those who desire to take up a post graduate course. Mr. Carne gie also wants the new university to take the lead in original research, so that the United States can eventually stand side by side with Germany, if not excel that nation. In scientific de velopment. Sir. Carnegie's plan does not propose a national university in the sense that an appropriation will be asked or need ed. The government is simply to be the trustee of the magnificent endow ment, just as It administers the fund bequeathed by Smlthson. It is proba ble that a board of regents will be ap pointed as In the case of the Smith sonian institution, or it may be that the government wlll be represented upon the. board of directors, which, j.t is con templated, shall consist of men of na tional reputation. Mr. Carnegie has kept the proposed endowment a secret until he could defi nitely arrange the plans and scope of the new university. Even yet all these details have not been arranged, so that little more than the outline of his gift can be published. It is known, how ever, that he does not propose to ask from eongress a single root or iana up

Fleishman Short In Ilia Accounts With the Farmers and Merchants Bank Nothing Seen of Him Since Last Saturday An Old Employe Officers Declare Bank Will Go On as tsual. Los Angeles, Cal., Dec, 9. H. J. Fleishman, cashier of the Farmers and Merchants bank of this city, has disap peared with a sum of the bank's money which Vice President H. E. Hellman es timates at $100,000. The shortage was discovered to-day. Fleishman has not been seen Bince 9 o'clock Saturday morning. At that hour he was at his club. He notified the bank people that he was ill Saturday morning and would not be at his desk. Nothing was thought of the matter at the time. When he failed to report to-day, his accounts were examined and the short age discovered. The exact amount has not yet been ascertained. Fleishman has been cashier and as sistant cashier of the Farmers and Merchants bank for mans years. He began work for the bank when a boy in 1875. He was under bond with a surety company for $30,000. In addition to this he has real estate" and personal property in this city, sufficient, in the opinion of Mr. Hellman, to protect the bank from the loss of a dollar. Fleishman married the daughter of A. J. Harrell, a wealthy cattleman of Visalia, but was divorced some time ago. He was a man forty-two years of age. The Farmers and Merchants bank, of which I. W. Hellman is president and H. W. Hellman, vice president, is the oldest and strongest bank in southern California. Its capital is $500,000, with a surplus of $1,000,000 and deposits of $5,500,000., H. W. Hellman said of the missing cashier: "Fleishman had no valid ex cuse for taking the money, v He has property enough to realize the amount he has taken from the bank. He was always considered a man of simple habits and unimpeachable Integrity. We are at a complete loss to account for his action. The bank Is amply pro tected and will not lose a cent." San Francisco, Dec. 9 I. W Hell man, president of the Nevada bank of this city and holding a similar office in connection with the Farmers and Mer chants bank of Los Angeles, made the following statement regarding the de falcation of H. J. Fleishman, cashier of the Los Angeles bank: "The fact that we hnvo been robbed of $100,000 cuts no figure. The bank will go on as usual and will not be In the least handicapped by the loss of such a sum, which, while large, does not affect the capital of the concern at all. I have made up my mind to prose cute him to the end should he be cap tured. We have wired every section of this country and Mexico and I have ev ery hope that he will be captured even tually. There will be no compromise. I cannot but believe that there is a wo man in the case somewhere. I feel cer tain that the defalcation was not made to cover up private speculation." Tillman Challenges Ilia Colleague to Realgn on the Spot That They May "Wash Their Dirty Linen at Home"- Sequel to the Bitter Controversy I South Carolina Last Spring. Washington, Dec. 9. The senate chamber was the scene of a highly dra matic episode to-day when Senator Till man of South Carolina challenged his colleague, Senator McLaurin, to resign with him on the spot in order, to use his own language, that they might be able "to wash their dirty linen at home." Mr. McLaurin did not take up the gauge. The incident to-day was the di rect sequel of the very bitter controver sy which arose between the senators in South Carolina last spring. Mr. Mcr Laurin arose to a question of personal privilege to-day and proceeded to ex plain what he charged was a conspira cy to discredit him in his own state for acts and views which did not meet the approval of certain democratic leaders He declared that he was being humil iated and according to public prihts was to be .excluded from the democratic caucus because he had acted Upon cer tain public issues in a way which he considered was for the best interests of the country and the people of his state. He announced himself a believer In the old democracy and after denouncing the new democratic leaders who, he said, had brought destruction upon his party, declared that he could not be driven from his old allegiance Into a party with which he did not care to affiliate. Senator Jones, chairman of the demo cratic national committee, denied that he had any "ulterior motives" In not Inviting Mr. McLaurin to enter the caucus. Mr. Tillman reviewed the whole controversy. Mr. Hoar took occasion to express the opinion that It was very doubtful whether both the South Carolina seats in the senate were not in reality va cant. He contended that when the res ignations were offered last spring to the governor they could not be withdrawn thereafter,' having become immediately operative. The climax came when Senator Tillman challenged Mr. Mc Laurin to Join him In preparing their joint resignations and handing them to the presiding officer of the senate. This challenge Mr. McLaurin did not accept and the episode was brought to an ab rupt close by Senator Lodge moving an executive session.

In Giving the Mayor Power to Appoint Members of the Commission George McCarthy Elected Enrolling Offioer Pavements Completed and Ready for Assessments Estimates Committee to Meet Thursday Right. The councilmen last night held a rather brief meeting, jfor 'them, the chief business of importance transacted be ing to concur with', the aldermen in electing George McCarthy military en rolling officer and to concur with the aldermen in giving the mayor the pow er of appointing a commission to revise the ordinance - For ' enrolling officer Councilman Bracken,,'of the Twsjfth ward, nominated Mr. ' McCarthy, and, there being no other nomination, Mr, McCarthy was unanimously elected. The matter of the ordinance revision commission has been hanging fire in the common council for about three months. This appointment rests with the common council, but some time ago deal was entered into, it is said whereby certain democrats were to vote 1th the republicans in transferring the ppolnting power to the mayor, in re- turn for which the assisting democrats would have the naming of the demo cratlc member of the commission. At several common council meetings there was non-concurrent action, but since the $2,000 included in this year's (appro priations for the revision would revert to the city treasury if no commission was appointed before the end of this month, a strong and successful effort was made to secure concurrent action last night. In view of the fact that $3,000 was spent for revision of the ordinances only about five years ago, there Is some protest against an additional expend! ture for the purpose at this time, but since the deal has been carried through thus far, it will probably be completed. A report was received from the direc tor of public works stating that per manent pavements had been completed, from the one-mill tax, in the following The President, tf He Deems It Practl cable, Is Requested to Enter Into Ne. gotlatlons With Other Powers to the End That Some Territory be Chosen- Matter Referred to Foreign Relation Committee.

Correspondence of the Associated Press.) Caracas, Dec. 2. One morning last week the people of Caracas who use the telephone, were very much surprised and alarmed at receiving no reply to their repeated calls on "central." Any unexpected occurrence in these troub lous times of revolution is sufficient to cause alarm. An investigation of fhe foregoing oc currence resulted in showing that the government had got wind of a revolu tionary plot and had taken possession of the central telephone office and stop ped the service In order to prevent easy communication between the conspira tors and to use the system exclusively for its own purpose of effecting the ar rest of the suspected conspirators, their friends and relatives, without loss of time. This was done. At the same time the government caused the arrest of General Ramon Guerra, minister of war and second vice president of the republic, at a point near Puerto Cabello. Guerra was also implicated in the plot. The Venezuelan government Is taking ropnsurcs tn pvevptit tbe Innrlir.g of arms and ammunition for the revolu tionists expected to arrive this month from Europe.
