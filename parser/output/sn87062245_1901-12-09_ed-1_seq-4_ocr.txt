its own people llerr Rebel calls the new Ger man imposts broilvvuclicr hunger duties so doubt he has read of the lenole of Cobdens crusade ngiinst the British taxes on food two gen erations ago There are men and women in Kngland ivho are hungry -who are made hungry by law Debel holds that Germany is in danger of the same experience Time alone can bIiovv -whether he is right Dutch GiskIii There is a good deal of very rice human nature in the world This is the reason why there is manifested so much curiosity about the Queen of Holland relations with her husband We do not long to Know the truth about the German husband fiom vulgar curiosity and we are not to be told that the matter is none of our business It is the business of gentle and humane minds to hope that the stories of the consorts brutality are not true and that the other story of the abounding love and felicity of the roynl pair is true So -whether or not it jicnsc those who are too nice for newspaper gossip and think that it ought to be confined to quiet corners and uttered in malicious whispers the newspapers -will continue to print what cornea to them from the Dutch The little Qneen of Holland as most people call her with an tjonate familiarity which is not in trusive but like u respectful carese has won the hearts of the world by Jier girlish beauty and her simple dignity which teems more like that of character than of station She was n girl on a throne and filled her high place vf ith the native man ner born of long descent from demo cratic princes Therefore of this land will be glad of the assur ance that lrince Henry is not brutal to WHhelmina that Major Von Tcts was not killed by him in a duel but that on the contrary life in the pal ace since the marriage has been one long honeymoon CroUerii Value Mr IJichard Crokers retirement from the leadership of Tammany Hall may or may not be about to take place Tin world is full of last ujh pearances There were Batti and Cimpanini unci several others Hut if it should really take place it -would not be an unmixed blessing It is difficult perhaps impossible to find just such another boss as Croker and Huj long as our sell governing munic ipalities arc to have bosses may the day soon come when this necessity shall be obviated Croker is as good a bo s as can be found in England or out of it His finest virtue is his unconsci ousness of the mora degradation of his organization ami of himself He takes the public Into his confidence He informs it that he is in politics for his own pocket When he is asked if he has used his political power to sell franchises to kill on a rival tele phone company for money to black mail merchants who have goods to sell the city to prevent the introduc tion of a lireproofiug material until he has been arranged with he re sponds that that is his private busi ness When the connection between the police and vice had been proved he stood by the police When a judge on the bcntai would not submit to his dictation Jit ordered that the judge be not renominated He is a bad lot and not knowing It confesses it Therefore for the itdvanuige of decency Crokers re tention of his leadership would be for the licat The town knows him and might lutvc to find oat his Kueecwor An inclttli Crlticlini There are three admirable wwkly papers publinliiil in Jondou whose on UngHivli Huropcan Aai nlie anil African affairs are interest ing and informing but when they come Jo talk of the United States thM wuggist the need of serious lending on their part before the task of comment i continued Here for example is the Speaker ne of the most impartially ignorant of our critic- denouncing Mr Roosevelt for uininning the evils of trusts H the Speaker had the right to an opinion on such a subject it could not speak thus of the message with out lajing ilyejf open to the charge of unfairness The President did not pretend to consider the subject of trusts as an economist or a soci ologist or u political reformer He talked about trusts as one giving praetlcil wlvice to a law making body as 1o what It might and should do for their regulation If he had talked about the wide spread ruin cirruption economic tjrnnny and domestic nllliclioii whatever that may mean brewing in America as a result of trust abom ination he would have vapored like Bryan or the Speaker Moreover he would have addressed the Federal Legislature on matters over which it has no jurisdiction but which lie en tirely within the realm of the courts or of State Legislature or of nature And it is the absence of this kind of loose generalization which is one of the virtues of the message Mayor Harrion of Chicago declines to furnih any limelight for anar chists In pose as martyrs which -proves that Major Harrison has the seine denominated horse Senator Hoar has concluded that it would be easier and more comfortable to have the date of inauguration changed than to have the chief per sonages enclosed in a glass case and in this the country will agree with him A post office inspector says that legislation has been found necessary for the prevention of the betrayal of family secrets by postmasters Is the reading of postcards no longer one of the perquisites of the rural office It is reported that Mr Bailey now that he has reached the Senate wears a black tie instead of n white one but nobody knows just what he is in mourning for The President of the George Junior Republic says that it is easy to keep a bov clean but when von have done j tliatyou have not accomplished much Tis indicates that the gentleman ucrubs his proteges by proxy Mrs Annie Ttevnnt now snells her I name Anne and it is to be feared I the microbe of style has got hold of her Thcre is a capybara at the Zoo in Chicago and most of the inhabitants of that burg are uncertain whether it is a quadruped a biped or a new kind of snake Hoston has cornered the squash market but so long as yams are roving wild and free in South Caro lina the squash market can be squashed for all we care The Chicago Tribune reports the tragedy in Virginia as follows Prominent i ciiiian tilled and two of hU friends aeiwriy wounded by Xcw Yorker t the Isttire country ant mr VI athtnrlofi whom thty auwrhl to UtutiM for intuiting a ywn worots The Tribune should not be in too much of a hurry to remember that Mr Washington is dead President Itooscvelt
