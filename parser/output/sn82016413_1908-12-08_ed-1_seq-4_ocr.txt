We, howecr, doubt that there will be further change, of nttltiule on this subject. The compelling argument for refusal to tamper with the present law U that Hawaii shoulil be last to force an overthrow of the principles of Protection. The coastwise law Is its miioh a part of the scheme of protection as tho tariff schedule on foreign Imports. The argument for the passage of the mall subsidy at the present session of Congress is stronger than for n special exception for this Territory In tho coastwise law. THE 

MESSAGE i President Roosevelt' message luted. its relutlon to the Nation its a whole All through his Interesting chap Is n reiteration of the doctrines, tbdi1"1' "" nriitliiiiii. the courts. . , , , mid labor we find the American Idea alms, and the aspirations of his Ad- . ... .. ,.,, !.,, , .. mlnistiatlou. In Its special reference to tho Tct rltory of Hawaii the message is par ticularly vigorous and pointed. Though the President proposes noth ing new, he has touched on the vital necessities for the development of these Islands as n strong outpost transportation, immigration, and for- tlllcatlon. After reading the recommendation for thu suspension of tho coastwise shipping law, wo may better under stand why the Governor cabled hU regrets over tho action of the bull ness organizations in revoking their upprovnl of the bill embodying tho amendment for Hawaii in particular. The President goes at tho BUbJect of our needs in his usual Incisive and forceful style. He directs attention, to the cessation of oriental Immigra tion and tho opportunity for Internal development with a citizen popula tion. To uphold the prosperous con ditions of the Territory und nt tho same time build on right lines for the futuro we must have ample transpor tation facilities, improved harbors, and a free hand for securing labor from thu mainland and Europo, Tho conference of Territorial offi cers held yesterday with Secretary Garfield on European Immigration was obviously n preparation for car rying out the suggestion mado by tho President and presented to Congress today. Every detail of the message Is pithy and well worth careful perusal. That portion In which ho deals with tho corporations, the railroads, nnd the laboring men will, under present conditions of public mind, attract tho widest attention. One reading his schemo for tho con trol of tho railroads of the country cannot fall to observe tho lnllucnco the Chicago traction strugglo has had on the Chief Executive. It may bo a coincidence, but tho President in ad vocating control of corporation-owned railroads rather than destruction and Government ownership, has fol lowed what Chicago found a practical solution, ns set forth in tho state ment of the. situation given by Miss Tarbcl In tho American Magazine. The President demands In effect that the railroads shall bo sufficiently controlled by the Government to tako them outside the field of exploitation for tho benefit of swollen fortunes und tho oppression of tho people through rebates and unfair dealing with employees. He would have tho Federal Government supremo In handling Inter-Stato commerce. Ho would not rob n single Investor of ono cent of legitimate profit. He would atsuro tho employe a good wage. Ho would guarantee satisfac tion for tho public by a full puljllc fctatcment of tho affairs of tho cor poration, that tho peoplo may know exactly the condition under which the roads nro operating and whero the money is going. This Is Intensely practical. It has proved successful In ono of tho great municipalities. And the principle in volved is ono bo meaty with good hard business senso that It might well expand to the National field. In matters of National finance It la Interesting to note that taking tho full period of Mr. Iloosevelt's eervlco ns, President, tho country finds Itself many millions ahead, tho National debt reduced, und the Interest ac count cut down. It is In his mornllzatlon over the attitude oMho reactionaries 'of high finance and' the radicals of labor nnd socialism that the Rooseveltlan abil ity to volco the,Mntlmentiottho aw erage, common-sonso citizen Is mail;

Tho President calls for tho highest respect to bo paid the Judges on the bench, but hu believes that the courts should Inter pret law with a view to the advanc ing spirit of the times and some thought for the future. He objects to calling tho judges und the courts names, while reminding the courts and the Judges that they should be In some degree amenable to settle 1 public opinion. The chapter on preservation of tho forests is n liberal education to the man who thoughtlessly or criminally cays wo havo enough trees nnd to (.pare for nil time. It is worth while for local sup porters of Government by Commu nion to note that when speaking of the Philippines, tho President first points with pride to tho large meas ure of self-government that lias been granted the Filipinos and' of which they have found thcmsolvcs capable. blllty to defend yourself is the greatest ugent for peaco, according to our President. This sticks out all through his reference to tho Army, tho Navy, and the Natlonnl Guard.

Taken as a whole, the message, may be reckoned us exceptionally calm for n Roosevelt state paper.
