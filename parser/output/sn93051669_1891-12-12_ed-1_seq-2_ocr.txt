Tie Times-Mountaineer SATURDAY DECEMBER 14 1891 TOO MANY LUNATLC8. The fiendish attempt to kill Russell Sage, the railroad magnate, is clear proof that the lunatics in this country are not all in the asylum, and that we should enlarge these institutions and not allow persons to be at liberty who have homicidial tendencies. - When the manufacture of explosives baa progressed to such a degree that a ; vicious man can carry sufficient dyn amite in an ordinary leather valise to wreck a building and cause the death 1 of- several persons, or in his vest pocket to destroy bis enemy, it is time that legislation should be passed against the Bale or use of this cona- . pound. There is no man who has not enemies, and if the lives of reputable . citizens are at the mercy of evil-dis-: posed persons, it is incumbent upon t all governments having consideration : for the well-being of their subjects or citizens to curtail in a great measure individual freedom or be more careful whom they allow to roam at large. Mr. Sage is not worse morally than some men in almost every community. - and, in faot, we are firmly persuaded that many citizens in this republic would be much worse tyraats than the . Czar of Russia if they had the oppor tunity. As a matter of course, the ever j -day rules of business are such that the few seed re wealth at the im poverishment of the many, and this will naturally cause maliciousness and heart-burnings. The unfortunate will struggle to feed and clothe his family, ' while the unscrupulous and rich will live in palaces and enjoy the luxuries of life. This has been so in all ages of the world, and will continue to the end of time. Ordinary discernment of the every-day events of human life , emphasizes this fact, and the common- sense conclusion is that he who cannot maintain his footing by means deemed fair and usual in society, business or Dolitics. must go to the i - . . wall. He must be satisfied with the result, and any attempt to right wrongs by ' means of the shot gun or dvnamite bomb must be frowned down in the most 'emphatic way. Mr. Sage is a very fair man for a rail- road magnate, and his life and prop erty should be under protection of the same law as those of humbler citizens. ' The lessons taught by this outrage are apparent to every thinking man, and those are: There are not enough lu natics in our asylums; the spirit of unrest is - pampered too much, and dangerous explosives are too easily procured by . malicious, irresponsible persons. The - quicker these facts are acted upon by our legislators and courts the sooner will properly and human life be safe in this republic. The reading public had a delicious morsel last week in a divorce suit in high life in England, and now that ' the courts have decided the master there is a thirsting after something of . the same stripe. It is announced to day that the Duke of Clarence is to .wed his cousin the Princess Victoria, and this may in a certain measure saticfv the abnormal craving. We do not know who this duke is, nor do we care, . and we are equally ignorant about the Princess Victoria only that the name suggests the ruling qneen of Great Britain. Jt may be a pure love match, where heart meets heart, and soul melts in perfect unison with soul; or the contrary. . Either view of the case is uninteresting to us, for there is enough on this side of the Atlantic to engage the attention of all citizens ' without devoting any thought to mar riages in the " old world. Kingi queens,, princes and princesses, dukes and duchesses live as we live, should marry and love as we marry and love, and when the summons come to join the innumerable throng will be forced to cross the dark river singly and without the least aid from their sub jects. - British financial interests are rep- : resented in almost every country in the world, and especially in the South ' American republics. It is not at all surprising that the capitalists of Eng land should feel a deep concern in the stability of . these governments, and that during the periodical revolu tions their influence should be exerted in favor of what appeared to be the most substantial form. To a money lender or a money invester it makes little difference whether it is the reign ' of the people or of the autocrat, if re turns are liberal, and this is the rule even in our own boasted free country. Money is not patriotic, or democratic or republican; . it is simply selfish. The English capitalist is the same as the New York or Chicago capitalist, or even The Dalles capitalist Love of country, enterprise, or even the bene fit of his fellows has no consideration. He simply wants his pounds sterling or twenty-dollar gold pieces to grow, and this he desires by any and all means, and irrespective of any or all consequences. It is a matter of great disappoint' ment to Democrats that Charles F. - Crisp, of Georgia, was elected speaker of the house yesterday instead of Roger Q. Mills, of Texas. It is true , that both are southern men, but they - are not harmonious in their opinions ' of a national policy. Mills is more politic, and during bis congressional career has attempted to draw together the east, west and south; but this is not expected of Crisp. He will un doubtedly advocate free coinage, a 1 C A avttnlaa produced in the east and consumed in the west, and retaining duties when it would benefit his own portion of the country. As speaker it may be ex pected that a new policy will be in augurated by the Democracy, and that matters in the house will not be as calm and placid as a summer sea dur- ing the present session of congress. This being the year before the great presidential campaign, it is fair to pre sume that the actions of both parties will be shaped with an idea of their influence upon 1892, and that Mr. Crisp will have sufficient policy not to jeopardise th interests of his party. Hon. Joseph Simon, of Portland has received the endorsement of the Oregon delegation for the vacant cir cuit judgship, and it is very probable he will receive the appointment We presume he possesses the necessary qualifications and ability, although since his admission to the bar his rep utation has been that of an office lawyer, and he has rarely appeared in the argument of causes before the courts; but for several years past he has been known in this state as a poli tician, and one of the most unscrupu lous sort, and we do not believe in elevating such men to the judic iary. The legislative and execu tive functions of government are now controlled by partisans, but we should hold the judicial upon whose de cisions the rights of every citizen are dependent free from all extraneous interests, For this reason, although life-long Republican, we cannot en dorse Hon. Joseph Simon as the prop er person for the vacant judgship. Queen Victoria, according to the dispatches, is making arrangements for a visit to the continent, and the scions of nobility are preparing to re ceive royalty in a becoming manner. The air of one place suits her and the water-supply of another may be dele terious to her health, and all these matters have to be arranged before this monarch can touch her foot upon foreign soil. What bosh this is to burden the columns of the press of republican country, . and which is expested to be . read with interest by American families. Royalty is a relic of the barbarous ages, and in the next half century perhaps before the twentieth is ushered in will be classed with the ancient superstition regarding witchcraft, or those supposed by fool ish tests to have given themselves up to the dominion of Satan. The ruling of Speaker Reed, in the last congress, that for the purposes of a Quorum, those Dresent should be counted, whether they desired to vote or not, has been the practice of every deliberative body in Europe, and in the discussion of this matter it must be remembered that in all assemblies in the United States parliamentary usage prevails. Mr. Crisp, although an Englishman by birth and by a long line of ancestry, ' may, to please the southern members of the party, rule differently; but the fact remains that we follow . precedents in this regard from his own country. The Democratic party is willing to uphold any action by which it can secure succes, and the beginning and end of its creed is, the end justifies the means. . Every one who has the least acquaintance with politics in the United States knows that Tammany hall has been the most corrupt ring chat ever existed in any country, and yet we find this organization defended by tfie Boise Democrat, the leading Darjer of the party in Idaho, in the following language: "When the mo nopolistic papers abuse Tammany they are on their last legs. Were it not for the organization and its influence this country would long ago have been an oligarchy, ruled by Adamses, Lincolns, Chases, Camerous, Goulds, Astors, Harrisons anything or anybody who had money coupled with a small de gree of talent and a Tory ancestry. The people will certainly check this tendency. Their action is slo w 'but sure. An exchange writes an editorial on the all-pervading question, "Ate we Content?" and devotes about a column to the discussion of the subject. If men's ambition are limited, and their wants very few, they can easily be contented. But if the conundrum, in the singular form, were put to Grover Cleveland, Gov. Hill, Jay Gould or Henry Villard, the answer would be in the negative. Those who are satis fied with present acquirements are contented, and life is a happy, go-easy state of existence, with nothing to annoy them. The world would not advance much if such constituted the majority of the human race, and we are glad for the sake of scientific de velopment and the betterment of the human race that the world, as a gen eral rule, are not contented. With Mills as speaker of the house, and it is likely he will be elected, the issues in the next campaign will be clearly defined, and the tariff will occu py a prominent position. The economic policy of the United States will be on trial, and the result can be easily de termined. Those measures which have placed this republic as the leading one in the world, will not be changed at the behests of southern Democrats. American workingmen have equal power at the polls with capitalists, and they will use the bal lot to insure sustenance for their fam ilies. Dom Pedro, the deposed emperor of Brazil, died at Paris, five minutes after midnight this morning. He was aged 66 years, and was emperor in his native country from 1841 until called to resign a few years ago. Although born of royal parentage, Dom Pedro was a man of generous impulses and acted for the best interests of his sub ject In his death it may be said that Brazil lost her firmest and most patri otic friend. It may be that free silver will not constitute a plank ' in the Democratic platform in 1892; but if it is not, the leaders of the party will have wasted considerable eloquence during the re cent fall campaign. TUB 

MESSAGE. The president's message is published in nearly all the city dailies, and as a supplement to all the country publica tions. As a matter of fact, there is not one in a hundred of our citizens who have the patience and fortitude to read every sentence in these long winded political documents, and ' we believe the time could be spent much more profitably by American citizens in studying the institutions and his tory of the country. Of course, every president, from Washington to Harri son, has attempted to set himself right before the sovereign people, and to accomplish this has had recourse to all the subterfuges known to rhetoric and sophistry. This year, being the one preceding a great presidential content, the message is supposed to bridge all chasms and apply a healing balm to all wounda, and in these mat ters President Harrison has proyed himself eaual to the emergency. As a Republican, we endorse his position on the tariff; but on the monetary question would have been much better satisfied if he had come out more boldly in favor of the world's basis of gold as the Btaudard of value. If the United States could surround itself with an impenetrable wall and deny all monetary exchange with foreign nations it could make iron, lead, or silver the medium of exchange; but un til such epoch occurs and it never will in all probability this country will be forced to adapt itself to the usage of o;her nations. It may be said to the honor of the Republican party that it has never faltered in upholding the economic policy of protection for American in dustries, and President Harrison simply echoes the sertiment of the American people in his endorsement of the Mc Kinley bill This will be clearly demon strated in the presidential contest next year, when we have no doabt the sov ereign people will give their verdict in favor of the policy pursued for over a century of protecting our own fire sides and citizens in their wage-earnings as well as in their individual lib erties. The conditions of climate and sou are such in this republic that a tax placed on any product is not a di rect tariff on the consumer. This is far different in England, although the rights of the subject are equally pro tedted; but by reason of the limited area devoted to agriculture, any tariff on wheat or other necessary commodi ty, would bea direct burden on the peo ple. That ' country cannot raise raw material sumcient to supply the home demand. It is otherwise here. We can produce wheat, wool cotton and iron sufficient to supply home consumption and manufacture?, and have a surplus for export In the one case protection leads to impover ishment of the laborer and factor, and in the other to giving strength and stability to development of resources and the inauguration of local indue tries. The president is moderately firm in the Chilian affair; but it would have been more satisfactory if the Balti more, at the time of the outrage in Valparaiso, had opened her ports and demaudad immediate reparation. This country cannot be too vigilant in pro tecting the rights of citizens. Of course Mr. Harrison manifests firm ness, but it is rather late now to bluster about what has already hap pened. It is a deplorable affair the massacre of the Italians in New Orleans, and is an act that causes a blush of shame to to mantle the cheek of every honest American. The present administra tion will use its utmost efforts to set tle the matter amicably, and this should be dona by all means. The message follows the usual beaten track of these documents, and is not in any way different from what might be expected from a Re publican president ' In the future it may happen that these state papers will be so concise that citizens may spare the time to read them; but until this happens, people can only pay a casual, cursory glance at their con tents. 

FREE TRADE ASKS INDUSTRY TO BOW. Let our readers search with care and see the result of the great ; Bir mingham conference of the ablest bus iness men of. England,: and its most sagacious statesmen, when looking over the uncertain, gloomy sea of free trade, and searching for anchorage grounds for agricultural industries, the course pursued towards its own agricultural population for the last twenty-five years, making it and all classes of labor subservient to con centrated capital engaged in foreign trade oi manufacturing, the success of which has depended upon the low cost of their products, and the power of capital and the government to lengthen hours of labor and squeeze smaller and smaller the pay therefor, their food being the product of the lowest of un progressive servile labor-of the people and countries to which th6 bulk of their manufacturing products have been consigned. The profound economic lesson which the free trade policy of Great Britain has been teaching, is now being illus trated in misery and suffering upon her own soil, at her own doors, and there at Birmingham England's proud free trade lords and ministers met to search what should be done for the relief of agriculture and the laboring population of the British empire. The terrible condition of labor, especially agricultural labor, and the population engaged in such pursuit was clearly shown, and its affect was so alarming as to force the ministry to promise assistance to those who would work the lands of Ireland, Scotland and England as small farmers under gov ern ment aid. This free trade Eng land! Lord Salisbury expressed re gret to the adoption of such a measure , and during his speech blurted out his inmost belief when he commented upon one of the evidences of the free trade policy: the immense amount of England formerly under cultivation now lying fallow. "The non-tillace,' he said, "is due to the withdrawal of the protection under which the land formerly grew wheat That is the price you pay for the advantage of free trade. It is absurd to imagine it possible to correct the defect without abandoning the great policy to which we are all attached." Let the Ameri can farmer and laborer, the industrial capitalist and workman, in all the forms of American progress, by theae humiliating acknowledgments of the head of the British government, forced out by the stern philosophy of facts learn that free trade may exist for a while foreign commerce and transportation ana capital; it may for a short time bene fit him who purchases for his own use the products of cheap foreign labor, and concentrated capital, but it will dig a grave deep and sure for the people who neglect their own indus tries to build and strengthen their neighbors. Before the election the Democratic papers had much to say aoout tn? abandoned farms in New England, and held the McKinley bill directly responsible for this state of things in the old stronghold of protection. The state board of equalization of Massa chusetts has investigated this com plaint There were 906 such farms reported to the board by the assessors, and correspondence with the owuers brought replies from 547. There were 147 of these owners who said they had no desire to sell their "abandoned farms," 41 reported that they had sold, and 31 said their farms had been re turned falsely by the assessors. The secretary of the board in summing np his report says: "It would appear from the' number of such farms reported sold and from the number reporting that they do not desire to sell, that such property is either increasing in value or an increase is expected in the near future. The census of 1885 clearly proved to our people that agri culture was not on the decline in this state. The production of butter in creased from 3,745,293 pounds in 1865 to 9,685,593 pounds in 1885; and milk from 10,079,180 gallons in 1865 to 72,529,628 gallons in 1885. The esti mate for 1891 is no less than 100, 000,000 gallons." While corn and huy have fallen off as a product of the Massachusetts farms, milk and butter have increased many fold, and while there is less wool marketed now than twenty years ago these is much more muttou sent to market. But on the whole the Massachusetts farmer is 'more prosperous. If the McKinley bill is responsible for the "abandoned farms" it must also be responsible for the increase in value of these farms which have gone into sale for lots in manufacturing districts and in new suburbs to prosperous cities. . Since Tammany has secured control of the New York Democracy, consid erable interest centers around Goy, Hill, who has been an ardent disciple of ring rule during his political career, and who has lately become prominent as a candidate for the presidency in 1892. There is an expression, some where between the covers of -the old book known as the Bible, "O, that mine enemy would write a book," and to the edification of Republicans, this great exemplar of pure and undefiled Democracy delivered a speech at El mira, N. Y last Friday. From bis utterances we learn that he is opposed to free and unlimited coinage of silver. This will not agree with the sentiment of Speaker Crisp, or what Mr. Vorbies has been saying in Indiana. Perhaps this is the idea of .the Tammany De mocracy, and the party of the nation. if it acknowledges New York dicta tion, must accept the terms given. As a f matter ot course Mill attached the present administration and did every thing possible . to show the evil effects of the present "robber tar- in. 15 ut there are few wage- earners in the United States that would willingly submit the decision in this matter to the corruptionists in New York city. It is well for 'the people to understand that Tammany hall in New York city is opposed to the free coinage of silver, to protec tion and internal improvements. This might have been expected, for the bread-earners of the west, south and iracitic slope have nothing in common with the millionaire bankers and aristocrats of the metropolis. The Republican party is willing to go be fore the country with Democracy of Tammany diametricrlly opposed to it on all national questions. Tammany carried New York at the last election, and will unquestionably dictate the candidate of the Democ racy in 1892. Gov, Hill is more in harmony with the methods of this corrupt ring than Mr. Cleveland, and in this regard has a great advantage in securing the nomination. It is true that the ex-president, knowing that success could only be secured by com promising with these unscrupulous politicians, has held out the olive branch to the Tammanyites; but Hill has drilled with them for years, and he is more to the manner born. For these reasons, it may be expected tbat the next national convention of Dem- crata will not be peaceful, and it is somewhat premature to state who will head the ticket in the next presidential campaign. Our cotemporary, the East Oregon- tan. aside from the time given to Democratic ideas, is devoting its leisure moments and talent to furthering tbe schemes of Bellamy regarding nation alization of land and labor. In these matters we believe it is wasting its energies, for it cannot harmonize the advanced ideas of Mr. Bellamy with- the ring rule of lammanv, and Utopia will not be the condition of affairs this or any other republic while cer tain conditions continue to exist. It is more practicable to take the world as it is to-day, and, by feasible legis lation. attempt to remedy the most glaring evils, than by preaching a rad ical change in affairs accomplish nothing. Theory always exists in the region of the imagination, and has all the beauties of poetry in rhythm and metre: but it is poor consolation to wase-earners of to-day to know that perhaps, in the next thousand years. there will be a grand reformation, We must deal with facts as they exist. and not by aiming too high entirely forget some matters which could be bettered by concerted action. A Kansas Republican pappr has something to say about the unfavor ableness regarding agricultural prod nets, and the Democratic press of Oregon are using it as an argument against the McKinley tariff bill and the present administration. The peopl may as well consider the same measure the reason of their prosperity and the high price for wheat. The- real, log ical facts in the case are these: Kan sas was never intended as a place in which white men should live, and th aboriginees in Indian territory an elsewhere should be transferred that portion of the United States. O the contrary, Oregon is aa nearly para- dise as any region on the con tinent, and will support ail persons who are thrifty and industrious. Th Mills' bill could not have killed it, and the McKinley measure will only have the effect to permit the state to devel ope and grow. The dispatches to day state that "Mills, sore and disgruntled, refused to accept a seat of any prominence in the house, but seated himself far hack on the Democratic side in the extreme outer row." This gentleman is from the south, and should have learned long years ago that northern Demo crats are simply footstools for lb southern wing of the party. He at tempted to make Democracy suited to all portions-of the country: but the south decreed otherwise, and ho must- step down and give place to one more suitable to its wishes. The Fugitive Slave law, Dred Scott decision, rejec tion of the free constitution of Kan sas, all emphasize the fact that the south has ruled the Democratic party from its inception to the present time, and, from appearances, will while th organization remains in existence. Of all the Spanish-American re pub lies Mexico appears the most peaceful ana wnere lite ana property receive the greatest protection. Under Pres ident Diaz' enlightened rule there has been a marked advancement in national matters, and to day the conn try is enjoying greater prosperity than ever before.

TELEGEAPHIO. tress Comment. New York, Dec. 8. Editorial com ments of morning papers in thi9 city upon the speakership result are as fol lows: Tbe Herald: "It 13 all right. The object of tbe contestants bas not been to elect a fitting and well-equipped chair man, simply, but to push the claims of Cleveland or Hill in the coming presi dentiul campaign." The World: "The choice is significant of the dominance of a prudent spirit in the great Democratic party." The Times: "The election of Crisp by a coalition ot the demogagy of Hill, the spoilmongering of Tammany, the pro tectionism of German and " Bnce, the halrcnrrnpt, half-fandiical I'ree-Hilver movement aud tbe old South, mu-t in eviiably give a pause to the men who believe the Democratic party to be the nt instrumentality for the accomplish ment of tariff reform and for a clean and honest administration of govern mont. The Tribune: "Tbe two wings of tb Democratic party have been righting eacn other with all the intensity of men who Lave rooted convictions, and whose convictions are, moreover, supplemented by personal interests of the gravest uature. It the Westera and Southern policy should lie adopted, Cleve'and would have to stand aside for snuiebod else.

A Head Knd Collision. rULLHAA, wasu., Dec. 7. A serious colision occurred here yesterday morning in a cut, close to the crossing where the passenger train stops for meals. The cut is deep and on a sharp curve, and when the local freight going south bad just pulled out, the engineer saw aoou 100 feet ahead the Lewiston branch freight bearing down on uiin. Both trains were ruuning slowly, but with their great weight and the tma!l space between, a collision was unavoidable The engineers had barely time to reverse before the engines came together. The smaller engine of thestuth bound train was badly demolished, having the pilot and front smashed in. The tender was lifted off the trucks and driven back on a flatcar loaded w;th lumber. The other engine sustained but slight damage, but was derailed, jno one was seriously hurt. lbe pas-enger train for tbe siuth was delayed by the wreck, which will soon be cleared away.
