The Ananias club at Topeka is con sidering the propriety of making all of the editors in Kansas City honorary members. "Kansas is a hail of a kountry. Ycu peeples vote prohibition, and now God-a-migbty shut off the vater," re marked a Douglas, county new-comer during the late dry 'spell. The Kansas corn crop will amount this year to about fif ty-flve bushels to every man, woman and child in the state, the chinch bugs and the drouth to the contrary notwithstanding. At four dollars a gallon, 187 gallons of whisky and wine would amount to 748. This was the amount billed to Emporia Tuesday by one express com- pa"7- ' If It is true that the best men are raised from the worst boys, what a brilliant array of talent we will have in a few years judging by the whole; sale arrests of Tuesday and Wednes day. Thebe came near being one less mem ber of the House, because the new one from Texas who succeeds Senator Rea gan blew out the gas and went to bed. He must be a curiosity in the way of a congressman. The question has arisen among medical men in Kansas whether it was the rope or the half pint of Wichita whisky which Lee Mosier drank im mediately before his execution that caused bis death. Mr. Gay, a democratic member of congress from Louisiana, denounces the president's message as an out and out free trade paper and declared that it would make Louisiana a republican state if the president's recommenda tions were carried out. Am item has been going the rounds of the Kansas press to the effect that the Newton Republican and the Em poria Democrat would suspend their dally editions January 1. This, so far as It concerns itself, the Newton Re publican denies.' The Kansas City Times says that the attempt to Introduce Volapuk as the. universal language of Aryan de scent has fallen a fiat failure. The discovery has been made that there is only one swear word in it, and that onsequently it would be of no earthly use at ward caucuses. Protection may cause trouble in the democratic ranks in the south, but the real rock which threatens to wreck the democratic ship called the Solid South promises to be the same one which has so badly split- the re publican party of the north prohi bition. Indiana is not a prohibition state, but Indianapolis has securttl the next Prohibition National Convention. It will be held there next June. Indian apolis is central and accessible and would bo a good convention city If it was big enough to afford, accommoda tions. The Wyandotte Gazette tells us that in the valley of the Kaw are located over half of the business houses, the transactions of which are the basis of the clearing house reports of Kansas City, Mo., and more than half of this business is done on the Kansas side of the state line. The beauties of the free trade doctrine are well illustrated in Erifr land. A bread riot of the poor is now a regular event every Sunday in Lon don, let Kngland is a free trade country, and ought to enjoy all the - benefits so lavishly promised by Cleve land for this country. IUimi Kohleh, a Jewish reverend. gave a temperance sermon last Sunday. lie advocated self control instead pro bition, and called attention to the fact that the Jews, who have na temper ance societies, are a sober and frugal people. Commonwealth. A few days ago the editor of the Democrat said he had been loaded for boar but had only succeded in shooting a skunk. Possibly he mispelt the word "bear," meaning "beer." But in case he said what he intended to, he can now use his ammunition on the game he was loaded for. Mr. W. P. Rice, who is a prominent Kansas City banker, says that if all the papers of the country would say that money Is easy, money would be easy. There is plenty of money in the coun try. All that is needed is a return of confidence on the part of the money holders. A lack of confidence will cre ate a stringency in the money market -at any time. The women suffragists of Kansas have adoped a yellow ribbon as their distinctive sign. They call it the "sun flower badge." They chose It, they say, because, as the sunflower follows the sun, civilization follows the wheel track and the plow, so woman suffrage inevitably follows civilized govern ment. But others state that the color was selected more on account of its appropriateness, yellow, in the lan guage of tovers signifying "forsaken." The republican national committee has decided that the next national con vention of that party shall be held in Chicago on June 19 next. The follow ing shows the dates and places at which the national conventions of the repub lican party have been held, and the presidential nominee selected at each: Date.

TRUB TO FRIENDS. The dependent pension bill was cal culated to benfit union soldiers; the Mexican pension bill almost exclusively benefitted rebel soldiers. Cleveland ve toed the former and signed the latter. The repeal of the tariff on wool would harm only northern fanners; the repeal of the sugar tariff would harm only southern planters. Cleveland ad vocates in his message a repeal of the former but not of the latter, although the former would not reduce the but plus revenue one-tenth as much as the latter. WOOL VS. SUGAR. With S-50,000,000 of tariff on wool and $50,000,000 tariff on sugar, President Cleveland in his message deliberately recommends the abolition of the for mer as a measure calculated to reduce the surplus in the treasury, while he is willing to let the latter remain. But this is only on a par with bis pension veto. Like in the pension messages, he favors the solid democratic south, even if by so doing he does great injustice to the north. When he signed the Mexican pension bill and vetoed the dependent pension bill he but set an example that in his message ne Is following up by advocating the repeal, of a taruz pro tecting northern wool growers, al- tnougn ten times trie amount or. re duction could be made by a repeal of the sugar tariff. But then the sugar is at present almost entirely made in the south, and were he to advocate repeal of all protection tariff whatso ever, sugar would undoubted be the last on the list. ON TUB 

DOWN GRADE. Under the above heading the Hutch inson News has the following kind and complimentary remarks regarding Wichita: The Wichita Eagle is getting in a desperate strait. Not content with ly ing about its own town it now turns in on its neighbors. There is no better evidence of the decadence of Wichita than the frantic and crazy frothing of the Eagle Sunday morning. The idea of Wichita, a town off on branch roads, stuck down in the mud so deep she can neither be drained or sewered, ever making a city of any pretentions, was never contemplated by rational men. She is in a pocket and is being squeezed daily by the towns that surround her. There is Arkansas City, Winfleld and Wellington on the south, Kingman and Anthony on the west, El Dorado on the east, Newton on the north and Hutch inson to the northwest. These cities, instead of contributing to "Wichita's greatness," will see to it that they all make better towns themselves within the next five years. They have the lo cation and facilities to do it. We will vouch for Hutchinson doing it, and can do nearly as much for some of the oth ers. Beat the air and paw the earth. Marshal M., as much as you like, but remember you are now on the down grade and the boys are all on to you. A GOOD WORD FOR KELLY. The following irom the Burlingame Independent, coming from the source which it does, can be considered but as a recommendation of the best kind for Brother Kelly. Any republican who succeeds in dealing a knock-down blow of sufficient power to knock the third party powerless in an entire state, and that state Kansas, should deserve the best his party has as a reward of merit. Following is the article: The Rev. Bernard Kelly boom for governor is again booming. The Fort rcott Monitor starts the ball again x his is unfortunate.

SERVICE PENSION. The Union Veteran Army, of which organization Gereral D. B. Long Ellsworth is commander-in-chief, has drafted a service pension bill, the pas sage of whic h will be urged before con gress at the present session. The provisions are: Every honorably discharged soldier, sailor and marine who served in the army or navy of the United States during the late war of the rebellion, between the 4th day of .March 1861, and the 1st day of July lb6o, ror a period of not less than 100 consecutive days, or who served less than 100 consecutive days because dis charged by reason of disability con tracted in the line of duty, shall, on due proof, recieve a pension during the remainder of his life, as follows: For three years or longer service, $12 per month. For two years or longer, but less than three years service, $J per month. For one year or longer, but less than two years sen-ice, 7 per month. I or less than one vear. but loncer than 100 days service, $0 per month For less than 100 days service, if dis- cnargeu oy reason or disability con iraciea in tne line or duty, $0 per uiom.ii. In case of the death of any such sol dier, sailor or marine, receiving any grade of the aforesaid service pension or being entitled thereto, his lawful widow, if any, shall receive or continue to receive the pension of her deceased husband, less twenty-five (25) per cent um, said pension to cease in case of her re-marriage, and from the date there of. This pension shall be additional to any pensions granted or to be granted on account of disability, and it shall be known as the service pension. It provides also that this pension shall be paid quarterly, under the rules and regulations of the pension depart ment, and that any person receiving sucn service pension who is convicted of felony shall forfeit the same. This bill, it is said, will receive the support 01 a large majority of old soldiers. OUR " 

WHAT IS IT." lhe theory of the Republican and many other Kansas papers, that be cause prohibition has become the poli cy 01 mo republican party no one who pretends to be a republican has any right to object to such a fool measure as the Murray law, is absurb. It was only by objecting to whisky that the prohibitionists were enabled to create a sentiment that allowed such a law to be passed, and it is only by showing the faults in the Murray law that we may hoie to have it amended in some ra tional manner. '- As its provisions now operate, it only acts as a barrier to business in Kansas, wniie it does not reduce the amount of liquor drank one ounce. It also provides a splendid field for bhelunaiUng, inasmuch s little hand bills calling themselves prohibition papers, are published under its wing, which distort facts and prints names of citizens as being buyers of whisky, who in fact have not, and whose names do not appear on the druggist's lists. The inference thrown out by this printed list, is that all whose names appear thereon are drinkers. Young men whose mothers or sisters have been forced to sign these receipts ao net ujte to see weir names appear in company with some of those printed, and, while we believe in abiding by the law, still, we would not think the worse of a brother or son who cowhidedthe defamer of his sister or mother. Were the sheet a legitimate newspa per, which made this feature merely a matter of news, it would not be so bad. But, when its so-called editor makes it his business to go to drug stores and make himself so offensive that were he not working under the protection of this law, he would be kicked out of doors as an unmitigated nuisance. claiming to w a newspaperman, he becomes a serious farce instead of only a harmless fanatic. Why, if this person would go into any dry goods or hardware store in the city and put on such airs and make such demands as he does in the drug stores, his head would soon be made so large he could not get out of the door and justly, too. Yet there are people in Emporia who pretend to think he is doing a good work. Bah! The Clay Center Times in speaking of the great reduction of the working force on some of the railroads relates the following incident: "It is known mat one or two roads in tnis state se cretly cut down their operating expen ses to the minimum. Among other re ductions the forces on the sections were reduced, very often to only one man to the section. A few days ago a rail got out of place on a branch line on which there was. only one man to the section. The Btation man could not replace the rail himself and telegraphed for help The reply came back to hire a farmer to assist him and employ him at regu lar section man's wages. It took them about an hour and a quarter to do the work and the farmer's wages came to thirteen cents. Now it happens that this road is a great stickler for hospital fees. When the farmer was paid by the company's agent, twenty-five cents was deducted for this purpose that being the minimum charges which left the farmer in debt to the company twenty cents." Francis Sadi-Cahnot, the newly elected president of the French repub lic, was born in Limoges August 11 1837. He entered the polytechnic school in 1857, and afterward the gov ernment school of bridges and high ways. He was graduated in 1865 at the top of his class, and, after having been for some time secretary to the council of the school, was made a civil engi neer. He was elected representative from Chatau d'Or to the national as sembly February, 1871. He voted for all measures tending to adopt the en tire constitution. . He was in Ferry's cabinet, and retired with the other members when that cabinet was dis solved in November, 1881. He was re elected from the department of Cote Dendar on the republican ticket on Oc tober 4, 1885, and took the portfolio of finance in January 7, 1886. M. Sadi Carnot is best known for his special knowledge of the affairs of the public works. He has translated several of the works of John Stuart Mill. Our evening contemporary is getting out, 01 Dreatn trying to establish that when it came out for hiurh license only meant that the Murray law should be amended. We are pleased to find that the News is ashamed of its lift a blunder, and trust the community will accept its excuses just as though they were true. Suppose we consider the wnoie tnmg a typographical error? We have not the least idea what the above refers to. The News is not ashamed of any position it hastaken and has no excuses to offer for any blunders. However, it is ashamed of wilful misrepresentations made by its morning contemporary, and we hereby notiny it mat umess it mends ra ways and refrains from wilfuly maligning this paper we shall have to cut it off our exchange list and refuse to notice it in any manner whatever in columns. our The Ft. Scott Monitor is responsible for the following: The rage for ending female names with "le" has come to a ridiculous con clusion in a Missouri town. A citizen named Ake christened his daughter "Bell." She, adopting the style of the .Moiues,. busies, fannies and Matties of that region, had some cards printed "'Bellie," and now she appears to a dis tracted worm as "Miss Hauie Ake." "The types," observes a southern Missouri paper apologetically, "made us allude last week to our esteemed townsman, Mr. Polhemns, as a 'villain ous lounger.' We wrote 'versatile lawyer.' The error was overlooked by our proof- reader, a gentleman recently from Texas, who assures us, in exten uation of the oversight, that the two erms mean pretty muc h the same thing where he came from."

FROM CALIFORNIA. Bateretin Lettar for Bbwbi wkt JPrapaa saaawovlB- t Uke Costs. San Diego, CaL, Nov. 17. Editor of News: The following is a clipping from the San Diego Union of this morning, and as it treats officially of the death rate of the state of Cali fornia, I thought that some of your many readers who want to come to this coast on account cf their health would read it with interest, and I fully believe that many of them would not better their condition: The October bulletin of the state board of health shows that in eighty- four towns during that month, there were 1,040 deaths in an estimated total population of 707,450. Of these deaths, 140 were due to consumption. 61 to pneumonia. 11 to bronchitis 10 to congestion of the lungs, making over zz per cent ot a total due to disease or tne respiratory organs. The towns and cities where such diseases were most numerous are as follows: San Francisco, 122; Oakland, 66; Sac ramento; Los Angeles. 66; San Diego, 33; ban Jose, 28; Santa Ana, 15; Stock- ion, zz; ventura, iz; jyasaaena, iz; .Monterey, 15. Diseases of the Btom ach and bowels were fatal in 118 cases of which 64 occurred in this city, 48 in Oakland, and the latter scattered throughout the state. There were 30 deaths from diphtheria, of which 19 were in this city, and 21 from croup, of which 6 were also in San Francisco. Of scarlet there were 4 cases, measles o, smaiipox 2, typho malarial fever typhoid fever 32, remittent and inter mittent fever 7. The death rate from all sources for the month was 1.13, at the rate of 15.56 per year. This is an increase over September, due, it is claimed, to the meteorological conditions, whose in fluence has been manifested in diseases of the organs of respiration. The weather during October was warmer than usual for that month, and with the lack of rain, had an unfavorable influence upon the health. The in crease in typhoid fever is due to the low water in wells and the diminished flow in rivers. It is true that they have no storms here. Still, I fully believe that the peo ple here have to take greater care of their health than in Kansas, judging by the number we meet who are suf fering from colds, rheumatism and ma larial troubles. And then the want of eleetricity in the air is plainly and at times painfully felt, and to that is at tributed the very large proportion of insanity that prevails on this coast, as it is said that the ratio is six times as large as in any other state. Many will be disappointed in not finding a beauti ful country, and I can Bay to such that there is no use in looking for a beautiful country where the grass does not grow and clothe the hills and the valley with verdure, and in my opinion the grass crop of Kansas worth more than all the fruit produced in southern California. For the orange, this country is not equal to Florida, and then the trees are dying with the scale, and the vines are dying with a new disease in many of the finest districts. The complaint is also made that there is but little profit in grapes at eight dollars per ton. The expense of living here is very high and the inconveniences to be endured are many, not the least of which are the fleas, mosquitoes and dust, and they are almost equal to the plagues of Egypt. I will say before closing that the bay is beautiful, and that a sail on the bay and out on the Pacific is something al ways to be remembered, especially if you get seasick. Visitors all say of tms place tnat tney nave nothing but the bay and the climate. Of the cli mate I can say that it is becoming rather monotonous in a month's time, and that I would like to be in a Kansas rain, hail and snow storm for a while and I believe that a majority of the Kansas colony would like it too.

About half -past one Saturday morn ing fire was discovered by the night watch in the northwest part of the city. The alarmed was given and the company were soon on their way to the scene of the fire which proved to the barn of Alfred Lisle, a colored team ster who resides at 620 Neosho street. The firemen were ready to throw water in a very short time, but the pressure for at least twenty minutes was so light that nothing could be effected. In the mean time the brands were flying io all directions. As soon as the pres sure beanie aaSclant q do any good the flames were soon extinguished. The ! oarn contained four mules, a cow and considerable hay. One of the mules was burned to death and another badly Bwrcuea auout tne neck and head. The lack of force we learn was due to the fact that the engineer was running the old set of boilers while cleaning out the new ones. One set cannot be run but about two weeks without cleaning. xms, ait. ureenway was doine. and had let the force run very low and when the alarm was given could not catch up for a few moments.

The Republican of Friria has the f ollowine: wm ia oayof June last, the following local item appeared in h xiepunucan: 13 IT A PANTHKR? mere is consitinmriia c.:-n. north of the city, in the vicinity of the new waterworks dam, on account of a large wild animal rmuaTnv.in , Urol oct-u uj a number or PPS118: I w a monster, leaving tracks in the mud & irn mor.. "d-.The Moore Bro's had a yearling colt killed and fW.i ?t!Zr tic kitten and others have lost smaller animals, such as calves and hogs. Yesterday John B. Johnson and John Throckmorton, while riding in a buggy along the Burlingame road, about two and a half miles northeast of this city, l. j, " ammai about one hundred and fifty yards to their left, eating at the carcass of some dead beast. Mr. Johnson, who called ai wus omce ana gave us the informa tion, saia it was very large and of a uwnumuuMUf. from its snape and movements he had no doubt it was a bear. He informed some persons wnom ne snortly afterwards met of wnacne naa seen, and preparations were being made when he left, to hunt the animal down. We have no doubt but it is the same animal referred to in the above item. It should be killed. captured or driven into its hole and uie noie plugged up. Here is a chance ior some jMimrod of the Neosho to urmg a near into camp. At a casual reading the above article may look a little fishy, and, to those who have read the recent articles in the Republican relative to the Murray law, a peculiar interpretation might be put upon the deductions arrived at. .nevertneiess, we assure our readers tnat mere is a sure enough bear at large, which is probably the one which some time ago escaped from the Wiser ranch. It seems the Wiser boys caught three cubs while off on a hunting trip, and Drought them home. All these were kept until grown, when one of them had to be killed because it became vicious and pretty badly hurt one of the men on the ranch. Another soon after died, and the third disappeared and has not since been heard of or seen, un less mis proves to be the animal. A bear-hunting party was organized this morning, with Carl Nation as com mander, but when he learned it was a sure enough bear he resigned his posi tion and refused to hunt, although he had previously paraded the streets with an old blunderbus "loaded for bear," with bayonet attachment and an extra bayonet in his hand, which he asserted he wanted for use at close quarters.

Colonel Grant relates that General Custer once met in this city a noted cavalry officer who was a good writer and talker, and who was deuvering a lecture on Gettysburg after the war. Handing Custer a couple of tickets for the lecture, the cavalryman remarked: "I hope you will come, for I describe all the cavalry movements in that fight. By the way, I transfer your brigade from the right wing, where it did operate, to the left wing and mass it with my brigade; it mkes the story more imposing, you know." Absolutely Pure.

Adams, Union, 8oath Carolina, writes : " I wu afflicted with a terrible case or blood poison for about thirteen months. I " wa treated by the best physicians, and used Taiious kinds of remedies, but received no substantial relief. I anally tried tbe Swift Specino, and about four bottles cured me sound and welL" Col. a H. Kleser, editor and proprietor ef tne OpeUka, Ala., ZVmea, under date of August S, 1837, writes: "When I was a young man, through indiscretion, 1 con tracted a disease which has stuck to me for years. Some five or six years since I was troubled with paint, so as to make it dlmoult for me to walk. Having advertised the a a a in my paper for several years, I concluded I would try it to see if there was any efficacy in the medicine. I commenced using it according to directions and used half dozen bottles. I was once at a way station and, getting left, I walked the even miles and have never felt any return of the old malady. After experiencing the good effects 1 must say I am satisfied with the result. I am sixty -eight years of age and 1 feel now Uke a young man and can go to the case when neoensiry and set up from six to eight thousand ems without any Incon venience.

Hearing of your medicine, I went to a drug store, tbe pro prietor of which persuaded me to buy a preparation of his own, which he said was a sure cure. I used six bottles of his stuff and grew worse all the time. At last I ( diHflnuitM and deflDalred of a enre. I l friend who told me that your medicine had cured him. 1 went to the same druggist again and demanded your medicine. He re luctantly sold me twelve bottles, and I am now perfectly cured. I write this for the benefit of aunerera, to prevent their being deceived by false representations. I thank ou again for the benefit derived from your medicine." Dr. I. N. Chenev, a prominent physician, residing lnF.llavtlle, Schley County, Georgia, In a letter recounting the infallible success be has in curing contagious blood poison cases in his extensive practice, writes: "Those who know the almost inevitable, permanently dangerous effects of meroury will welcome your discovery of a a & as a boon to humanity.
