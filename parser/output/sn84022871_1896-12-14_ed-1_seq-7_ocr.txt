I ate a jar of plums yis taday and she blamed it on the hired girl. Dearest, if I were far away could you still love me? Why, Reggy, what a question! I'm sure the farther you were away the better I should love you. Teacher James, can you tell me what is meant by a cubic yard? James I don't know exactly, but I guess it's a yard that the Cuban children play in. I believe he had two sons; one of them was lost at sea, and the other became vice-president of the United States. And of course neither of them was heard of afterwards? Mother Don't eat your pie now, Johnnie; save it until the last. John nie Say, maw, I don't distrust you, but the kid who swiped my pie at the picnic said the same thing. I guess we'd better tell that errand boy he'll have to give up his habit of whistling, said the business man. I shouldn't do that, his partner replied. The only time he hurries is when he is keeping time to a march. Stand back! exclaimed the friend of the man who was down on the ground. Stand back, and give him air! And the bystanders accommo datingly stood back; while the man who was down on the ground calmly went on pumping up his rear tire. A great many people sleep between these walls, said the guide, showing a visitor through the ancient English church where the noble families were interred. Same way over in our coun try, replied the visitor; why don't they get a better preacher. Mrs. Coopah What fo' yoh take dat gun, Mr. Coopah? Yoh doan' want no gun to get a Thanksgiving turkey?

Hardbake, said the gentleman's friend, I am surprised to hear from good authority that you, a free born American, are in the habit of looking up to that titled foreign son of yours.

At the second battle of Bull Run a Michigan regiment, in making a change of position, came upon a Con federate soldier sitting astride of a Federal, who was lying on his back. Each had a firm hold of the other, and neither could break the hold. As the troops came up, the "reb" was taken in, and as the "Yank" rose to his feet he was asked how he had got into such a fix. "Why, I captured the Johnny," he replied. "Then how did he come to be on top?" "That's what makes me so mad!" shouted the bluecoat. "He captured me the same time I did him, and then he wouldn't toss up to see who had the bulge! He's no gentleman no sir, he aint!" Knights of tlie Maccabees. The State Commander writes us from Lin coln, Neb., as follows: "After trying other medicines for what seemed to be a very ob stinate cough in our two children we tried Dr. King's New Discovery and at the end of two days the cough entirely left them. We will not be without it hereafter, as our exper ience proves that it cures where all other remedies fail." Signed F. W. Stevens, State Com.

SPEOIAL OOa&BSPONDHCTOH OF THH MON1TOB. Washington, Dec. 7ih, 1896. Speaker Reed's '.'the House will please be in order" at noon today an nounced the opening of the last ses sion of the fifty-fourth Congress. Ev ery seat was not filled, but more than a quorum of the House was in attend ance. Ditto the Senate. The prin cipal business of the first day was the alleged listening to the reading of the message, because they all have print ed copies of it, but today, when they all knew that the recommendations of the message will not amount to a row of pins as a factor in influencing le gislation, there was scarcely a pre tense of listening. There are many points of resemblance between the message and that sent to Congress one year ago the same ideas are stated in different language. While none of the numerous repub lican Senators and Representatives who have recently been to Canton are willing to quote President-elect McKinley to that effect, their general manner of talking leaves not the slightest doubt that an extra session of Congress will be called together within a few weeks after the inaugu ration, to pass a tariff bill, regardless of whether this session passes any revenue legislation or not. Chairman Hanna has no reason to complain of any lack of attention since his arrival in Washington, to make the start on the preparation for the inauguration. Indeed, it is fair to suppose after seeing the crowds which are always around him he sees all callers that he would be just as well pleased with less attention. Gen. Horace Porter, who will be Chief Marshal of the inaugural parade, is one of Mr. Hanna's constant com panions and assistants. It is regarded as about settled that the Inaugural Ball will be held in the new Library Building. The substitute for the House Im migration Bill, which provides that no immigrant shall be admitted who is unable to read five lines of the U. S. constitution in some printed language is the "unfinished business" of the Senate and as such has the right of way in that branch of Congress. The bill is in charge of Senator Lodge who expresses confidence that it will pass. There seems no logical reason for op posing it. Certainly no man who is so illiterate that he cannot read in any language can be considered a desir able accession to our country. Senator Dubois of Idaho isn't half as sure that he will be re-elected to the Senate as some other people have assumed to be. He said on the sub ject: "Those friends who have been saying that I would certainly be re elected don't know anything about the situation. It is the democrats who are bothering me. They have united with the populists and are engaged in a still hunt for an original silver man to represent them in the Senate." And, while Senator Dubois didn't say so, it is evident that he fears they will find the man they are hunting for. There is no truth in the state ment that the Republican National Committee is trying to prevent the re-election of Senator Dubois, to punish him for bolting the St. Louis Convention. Representative Blue of Kansas, who has made more of a name for himself than most members do in their first term, and who was a victim of the popo-dem. combine, presents this word picture of the elements that carried his state this year: "The lead ers of the populists in Kansas are at heart socialists every one of them, and they welcomed Bryan's candida cy because they believed it was in its essence socialistic, as indeed it was. The unrest and discontent in Europe and in this country are but manifesta tions of socialism. Every man who had failed in his professional business, whose life had been unsuccessful, was on Bryan's side; so were those who contend that one man should not have any more property than anoth er; that all citizens should stand on an absolute equality regardless of in dustry and ability, and that it is the business of the government to sup port the people rather than the peo ple to support the government." Commissioner of Pensions Murphy has had several unpleasant interviews with republican Congressmen who accuse him of having during the cam paign, purposely delayed answers to calls they made on the Pension Bu reau in behalf of their constituents, for the purpose of injuring them and preventing their getting votes. Mr. Murphy denied the accusation , in every case, but that didn't prevent the indignant Congressmen having their say, and it will not prevent their working to have Murphy's head be among the first that falls after the inauguration of President McKinley. One of the notable absentees of the opening session of the Senate was Senator Allison of Iowa, who was kept at home by a severe cold. Bueklens' Arnica Salve.
