Speaker Cannon and many other prominent member! of congress arrived at the eapltol long before the opening hours and engaged, la a reunion and Informal discussion of probable Issues which will occupy their attention.

JAMES R. GARFIELD. New secret ry of ths Interior. chairman of the merchant marine and fisheries, were -among the early ar rivals. . The Japanese situation was discuss ed quite generally by the members, and the opinion was freely expressed that measures affecting the Japanese may be Introduced In the house at any time. Representative Needham of Califor nia was the first member of the dele gation from that state to reach the capitol. Mr. Needham is not from the San Francisco district and consequent ly Is not In close touch with the sit uation in that city arising from the ex elusion of Japanese from the public schools attended by white children. He said, however, that he believes present agitation will gradually die out and the situation will quietly set tle itself. , Representative Kahn of California aid he did not think the California delegation would take Immediate steps to pnsh any legislation affecting the Japanese. He said that the delegation probnbly would hold a meeting within two weeks for the discussion of the situation and doubtless would act as a unit In case decision Is reached to urge the passage of any special measure. Two Japanese exclusion bills, oue by Representative McKlnley of California and the other by Representative Hayes of California, are now pending In con gress. Mr. Lowden of Illinois announced the death of his predecessor, Robert Roberta Hltt. - Mr. Payne of New Tork called the attention of the bouse to the death of the late representative from the Twenty-first New Tork dis trict, John H. Ketcham. Mr. Glllett of Massachusetts feelingly called the at tention of the bouse to the death of Rock wood Hoar of Massachusetts. The election of Rock wood Hoar follow ed the death of his father, and be was looked upon with great favor by the people of bis state. . John M. Nelson, the new member from the Second Wis consin district, announced the death of the late Henry C Adams, bla prede cessor. Mr. Tayne of New York offered a resolution that a committee of three be appointed to meet a like committee from the senate to Inform the presi dent that the two houses were organ ised and ready to receive any commu nication he might desire to make. The speaker appointed Mr. Payne of New York. Mr. Bontell of Illinois and Mr. Williams of Mississippi. Practically all the veterans of the senile were on hand, most of tbem looking bale and hearty aa If their so aimer's rest, followed by a bnsy campaign, had agreed with them. One of the familiar faces most missed was that of Senator Allison. He has ar ranged to remain at his bom at Du buque, la, until after the holiday re cess, leaving the work of organization for the younger members.

Mr. Penrose's resolution follows: "Resolved, That the president Is re quested to communicate to the senate, If not imeomparJble with the public in terests, full information bearing upon the recent order dismissing from the military service of the United States uirco uuiupaaiea ui me i. weaiy-niia regiment of Infantry, United States troops, colored." Mr. Foraker of Ohio was on his feet at once, saying, "I have a substitute for that in the following resolution, and I ask that it be read and that both He over." ' , ; . v .;; ,'. v Mr. ' Spooner secured the rereading of the first resolution, and Mr. Warren of Wyoming asked that both go over. The Foraker resolution was read at his request. It was addressed to the secretary of wart directing that official to furnish the 'senate copies of all offi cial letters, telegrhins, reports and or ders filed In the; war department In connection with the recent discharge of the troops in question, together with a complete list of the men discharged, showing the; record of each and amount of retired pay each was entitled to un der -certain sections of the revised statutes. V ! Under the various requests that the matter go -over nothing further was said after the reading of the resolu tion. The message of the president was sent to the senate. It follows: ' . THE 

MESSAGE. President Roosevelt lu ' his annual message again urges tbe enactment of a law -prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign funds. He also urges the passage of the measure conferring upon the government the right of appeal In criminal, enses on questions of : law. Continuing, L tbe president says r " . I cannot too strongly urge tbe pas ' sage of the bill In question. , A failure to pass It will, result In seriously ham pering tbe government In Its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy - individuals or corporations who do wrong, and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for wageworkers who are not them selves able effectively to contest a case where tbe judgment of an Inferior court has been against them. I have specifically In view a recent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees without remedy for viola tion of a certain so called labor statute. The Importance of enacting into law the particular bill In question Is fur ther Increased by the fact that tbe gov ernment has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law la those trust and Interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a rea sonable ebanre of sncceita. , 

PROPER USE OF INJUNCTIONS. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law In connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to tbe mat ter by tbe demand that tbe right of ap plying Injunctions In labor cases should be wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the' use of Injunctions In such cases would stand the test of the courts, in which case, of course, the legislation would be ineffective. More over, I believe It would be wrong alto gether to prohibit tbe use of injunc tions. It Is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hands In upholding tbe law, and If men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no Im pairment of tbe power of the courts to deal with tbem In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated Inst ear. AGAINST LTNCHIXO. I call your atteutlon and the atten tion of the nation to tbe prevalence of crime among ua and, above all, to tbe epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up now in oue part of our country, now In another. Each sec tion, north, south, east or west, has tta own faults. No section csn with wisdom spend lu time Jeering at tbe faults of another section. It should be busy trying to amend Ita own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption It la necessary to have an awakened public conscience and to supplement this by whatever legisla tion will add speed and certainty In the execution of the law. Wbea ws deal with lynching even more is neces sary. A great many white men are lynched, but tbe crime Is peculiarly frequent la respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching Is tbs perpetration, especially by black men, of tbe hideous crime sf rape, tbs most abominable In all tbs category of crimes, even worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what It feeds upon, and wbea mobs begin to lynch tor rape they Speedily extend the j sobers of tbelr operations snd lynch I for msny other kinds sf crimes, so that J two-thirds of tbe lyncblngs are not t for rape at all. while a considerable i proportion ef tbs Individuals lynched are Innocent ef all crime. There la bat one ssfe rals la dealing wits black mea as wltb whits aaea.

If be is wise, will decflae to aDew the bead sad "PREACHERS OF MERE DISCON- , .-. ; TJSNT. i In dealing with both labor and cap ltal, with, the questions, affecting both corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important to re member than aught else, and that Is the infinite harm done" by preachers of i mere algcontent. These are the men who seek to excite a violent class ha tred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ments for the better control of corpora tions and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth Into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood In which the aim Is to In- flame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. Tbe sinister demagogues and foolish visionaries who are always, on conciliation and arbitration, would eager to undertake such a campaign : tend to create an atmosphere of frlend of destruction sometimes seek to as- llness and conciliation between con sulate themselves with those working ; tending parties. for a genuine reform in governmental j CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS, and social methods and sometimes mas it cannot too often be repeated that querade as such reformers. In reality ' experience has conclusively shown the they are the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, Just as tbe purveyors of sensational slander in newspaper or magazine are tbe worst enemies of all men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what Is bad in onr social and governmental condi tions. , "',-v ' ' Corruption Is never so rife as in com munities where tbe demagogue and tbe agitator bear full sway, because In such communities all moral bands be come loosened, and hysteria and sensa tionalism replace tbe spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus produced men are sure In the end to turn toward any leader who can restore order, and then their relief at being free, from the In tolerable burdens of class hatred, vio lence and demagogy Is such that they cannot for some time be aroused to In dignation against misdeeds by men of wealth, so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were in part responsible for the original out break.: The one hope for success for our people lies in a resolute and fear less but sane and cool headed advance along tbe path marked out Inst year by this very congress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled Into fol- 4 lowing either that base creature who appeals and panders to tuo lowest In stincts and passions In order to arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or that other creature, equally base, but no baser, who In a spirit of greed or to accumulate or add to an already huge fortuno seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous dis regard to tbelr welfare of soul and body. Tbe man who debauches others In order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit, and when hatred Is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. 1 The plain people who think tbe me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with head or band, tbe men to whom American traditions are aear, wno love their country rind try to act decently by their neighbors owe It to them selves to remember that the most dam aging blow that can be given popular government Is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. . RAILROAD EMPLOYEES'. HOURS. I call your attention to tbe need of passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. The measure Is a very moder ate one, and I can conceive of no. seri ous objection to it Indeed, so far as It is In our power, It sbonld be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general in troduction of an eight hour day. There are industries In which it Is not pos sible that the hours of labor should bo reduced, just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or. If In tbe tropics, so situated that there Is no analogy between their needs and ours In this matter. On the isthmus Of Panama, for Instance, the eondl- - joTernment should Impose s graduated tions are In every way so different inheritance tax and. If possible, a grad from what they are here that an eight uate)I nPome tax. nour nay wouia ne amnira, just as 11 aiwuru, so tar as iue isiumus is con 1 cerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether tbe necessary work Is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely Industrial standpoint snd from the civic standpoint It should be our object to do what we can In tbe direc tion of securing the general observance of an eight hour day. Let me again orgs that the congress provide for a thorough Investigation of the conditions of child labor and of thV tabor of women la tbe United States. The horrors Incident to the employment of young children lo fac tones or st work snywbere are a blot on oar civilisation. In spit of all precautions exercised by employers there are unavoidable ae- ! ddents snd even deaths Involved la j nearly every line of business connect- ed with tbe mechanic arts. It is a great social Injustice to compel tbe em- pleyee, or. rather, the family of tbe killed or disabled victim, to bear tbe entire harden of each aa Inevitable ' sacrifice. Ia ether words, society shirks ; Its duty by laying the whole coat ea the victim, whereas tbe Injury comes from what may be called tbe legttl- , mate risks of tbe trade.

Bsrerds shew tbst dartag tbe twen ty years frees Jan. t. 1S9L to Dec St 1900, there were strikes sfferttat I1L 500 estabBsssaeata, aad &KBJM ess- were throws eat ef esaa4ey CCf ke aaase fJW Cn wers 1,000 lockouts, involving nearly 10,000 establishments, throwing over 1,000,000 people out of employment. These strikes and lockouts Involved an estimated loss to employees of $307, 000,000 and to employers of $143,000, 000, a total of (400,000,000. The public suffered directly and Indirectly prob ably as great additional loss. Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred bad the par ties to tbe dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced body representing the nation and, face to face, state tbe reasons for tbelr con tention. Tbe exercise of a Judicial spirit by a disinterested body repre- 1 senting the federal government, such as would be provided by a commission j imnosslbllitv of securing bv the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations wblcb do not oper ate exclusively within tbe limits of any oue state. In some method, wheth er by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corporations a control that will, among other things, prevent tbe evils of ex cessive overcapitalization and that will compel the disclosure by each big cor poration of Its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether own ed directly or through subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the securing of Inor dinate profits by favored Individuals at tbe expense whether of tbe general public, the stockholders or tbe wage workers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control It as to see that It results In no harm to the people. ' Combination of capital, like combina tion of labor, Is a necessary element of our present Industrial system. It Js not possible completely to prevent it,' and if It were possible such complete prevention would do damage to tbe body politic. What we need is not vainly, to try to prevent all combina tion,, but to secure such rigorous and adequate control - and supervision of the combinations' as to prevent their injuring the public or existing in such form as inevitably to threaten Injury, for tbe mere fact that a combination has secured practically complete con trol of a necessary of life would under any circumstances show that such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to tbe public interest. It is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid all combinations instead of sharply discriminating between those combinations which do good and those combinations which do evil. Re bates, for Instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers (as was j shown In the Investigation 1 of the standard Oil company and as has been shown since by tbe Investigation of the tobacco and sugar trusts) as to tbe initiative of big railroads. Often rail roads would like U combine for tbe purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining Improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and of the general public. Such a combina tion, instead of being forbidden by law, should be favored. In other words, it should be permitted to railroads to make agreements, provided these agree ments were sanctioned by tbe Inter state commerce commission and were published. With these two conditions complied with It Is Impossible to see what harm such a combination could do to tbe public at large. 

INHERITANCE AND INCOME TAX. The national government has long derived Its chief revenue from a tariff on Imports and from an Internal or ex cise tax. In addition to these, there is every reason why, when next onr sys tem of taxation Is revised, the national r am weI, twtre tbtt Mfh t gnbJect as this nerds long and careful study In order that tbs people msy become fa- miliar with what Is proposed to be proceeding with wisdom and self re straint and msy maks tip their minds Just bow far they are willing to go fa the matter, while only trained legisla tors can work out the project In neces sary detail. Rut I feel that In the nesr future our national legislators should enact a law providing for a graduated Inheritance tax by which a steadily in- creasing rate of duty should be put I ntMa all mnnrva ar other valtuhlea mi. k wtt - t any Individual or corporation.

Our industrial development depends largely upon technical education, in cluding In this term all Industrial edu cation, from that wblcb fits a man to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter or blacksmith to that which fits a man to do the greatest engineering feat. Tbe skilled mechanic, the skilled work man, can best become such by tech nical Industrial education. The far reaching usefulness of Institutes of technology and schools of mines or of engineering is now universally ac knowledged, and. no less far reaching Is tbe effect of a good building or me chanical trades, school, a textile or watchmaking or engraving school. "t In every possible way we should .help the wegeworker who tolls with his hands and who must (we hope in a constantly Increasing . measure) also toll with his brain. Under tbe constitu tion tbe national legislature can do but little of direct importance for bis wel fare save where be is engaged In work which permits It to act under the in terstate commerce clause of the consti tution, and this is one reason why I so earnestly hope that both the legis lative and judicial branches of tbe gov ernment will construe this clause of the constitution in tbe broadest possi ble manner. THE FARMER. 1 The only other persons whose wel fare Is as vital to the welfare of the whole country as is the welfare of the wageworkers are tbe tillers of tbe soil, the farmers. Several factors must co-operate in the improvement of the farmer's con dition. He must have tbe chance to be educated in tbe widest possible sense, in the sense which keeps ever In view the intimate relationship between the theory of education and tbe facts of llfo. Organization has become necessary In tbe business , world, and it has ac complished much for good In the world . of labor. It Js no less necessary for farmers. , Such a movement as tbe grange movement Is good In itself and is capable of a well nigh Infinite fur ther extension for good so long as It Is kept to Its own . legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the as sociation of farmers for mutual ad vantage are pertly economic and part ly sociological. IRRIGATION AND FOREST PRES . ; ERVATION. . Much Is now being done for the states of tbe Rocky mountains and great plains through the development of tbe national policy of Irrigation and forest preservation. No government policy for the betterment of our Inter nal conditions has been more fruitful of good lhan this. ' DIVORCE LEGISLATION. I am well aware of how difficult It Is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless, In my judgment, the whole question of marriage and di vorce should be relegated to tbe au thority of the national congress. Tbe change would be good from every standpoint In particular It would be good because It would confer on the congress the power at once to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy, and this should be done whether or not marriage and divorce are dealt with. It Is neither safe nor proper to leave the question of polygamy to be dealt with by tbe several states. ' MERCHANT MARINE. . Let me once again call tbe attention of tbe congress to two subjects con cerning which I have frequently be , fore communicated with them. One is the question of developing American shipping. I trust that a law embody ing In substance the views or a major ' part of the views expressed In the re- port on this subject laid before tbe bouse at Its last session will be passed. It seems to me that tbe proposed meas ure Is as nearly unobjectionable aa any can be. THE CURRENCY. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. Tbe national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aid ing the enormous business develop ment of tbe country, and within ten years there has been an Increase la circulation per capita from (21.41 to $33.03. For several years evidence bas been accumulating that additional leg islation Is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the de fects of tbs present laws. There must soon be a revision of tbem. because to leave them as they are means to In cur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there bas been a fluctuation In tbe Interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent and the fluctuation waa even greater during the preceding six months. Tbe led In tbe constitution of Cubs.

OUTLYING POSSESSIONS. I most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or else abso lute free trade In Philippine products will become a law. . No barm will come to any American industry, and, while there will be some small but real mate rial benefit to the Filipinos, tbe main benefit will come by tbe showing made as to our purpose to do all in our power for tbelr welfare. . PORTO RICAN AFFAIRS. American citizenship should be con ferred on tbe citizens of Porto Rico. Tbe harbor of San Juan, in Porto Rico, should be dredged and improved. Tbe expenses of tbe federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. : : HAWAII. . . Tbe needs of Hawaii are peculiar. Every aid should be given tbe islands, and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the lines of a com- l munlty of small freeholders, not of great planters with cpoly tilled estates. . - '' ..' ALASKA. '", Alaska's needs have been partially met, but there must be a complete re organization of tbe governmental sys tem, as I have before indicated to you. I ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow citizens who dwell on the shores of Pnget sound with character istic energy are arranging to hold in Seattle the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific ex position. This exposition in its pur poses and scope should appeal not only to tbe people of the Pacific slope, but to the people of the United States at large. - ; RIGHTS OF ALIENS. Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with Justice and good will all Immigrants who come . here under the law. Whether they are j Catholic or Protestant, Jew or gentile, j whether they come from England or Germany, Russia, Japan or Italy, mat ters nothing. All we have a right to question is tbe man's conduct If he Is honest and upright in his dealings with his neighbor and with tbe state, then be is entitled to respect and good j treatment Especially do we need to 't remember our duty to tbe stranger j. within our gates. It is tbe sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against or In any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and who Is con ducting himself properly. To remem ber this is incumbent on every Amer ican citizen, and it is of course pecul iarly Incumbent on every government official, whether of tbe nation or of -the several states. . ' I am prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there as sumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility Is sporadic and is limited to a very few places. Never theless It Is most discreditable to us as a people, and It may be fraught with the gravest consequences to the nation. I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would ask fair treatment for Ger mans or Englishmen, Frenchmen, Rus sians or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity' and civilization. I ask It as due to ourselves, because we must act uprightly toward all men. I recom mend to tbe congress that an act be passed specifically ' providing for tbe naturalization of Japanese who come here Intending to become American cit izens. One of tbe great embarrass ments attending the performance of our International obligations Is tbe fact that the statutes of tbe United States are entirely inadequate. They fall to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through Unit ed States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens In tbe rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of tbe land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of tbe United States be so amended and add ed to as to enable the president acting for tbe United State government which Is responsible In our interna tional relations, to enforce the rights of aliens under trestles. , THE 

CUBAN MATTER. Last August an insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grew evi dent that the existing Cuban govern ment waa powerless to quell. Thanks to the preparedness of our navy, I waa abls Immediately to send enough ships to Cuba to prevent tbe situation from becoming boneless, snd I fur thermore dispatched to Cubs tbe sec retary of wsr and the assistant secre- tsry of state In order that they might grapple with the situation on the , ground.

PANAMA TRIP. I have just returned from a trip to Panama ' and shall report to you at length later on the whole subject of the Panama canal. x THE ALGECntAS CONVENTION. The Algeciras convention, which waa signed by the United States as well a by most of tbe powers of Europe, f j persedes the previous convention Of 1880, which was also signed both by the United States and a majority of the European powers. This treaty confers upon us equal commercial rights wltb all European countries and! does not entail a, single obligation ef any kind upon us, and I earnestly hope it may be speedily ratified. 1 . SEALING. The destruction of the Prlbllof Is land fur seals by pelagic sealing still continues. The herd, which, according to the survey made in 1874 by dlree tion of the congress, numbered 4.700, 000, and which, according to the sur. : vey of both American and Canadian commissioners in 1891, amounted te 1,000,000, has now been reduced to about 180,000. This result has beea brought about by Canadian and soma other sealing vessels killing the female seals while In the water during their annual pilgrimage to and from tha j south or In search of food. I Tbe process of destruction has been accelerated during recent years by tbe appearance of a number of Japanese vessels engaged in pelagic sealing. Suitable representations regarding the incident have been made to tha government of Japan, and we are as sured that all practicable msasures will be taken by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage. ' We have not relaxed our efforts to secure an agreement with Great Brit ain for adequate protection of the seal herd, and negotiations with Japan fee the same purpose are In progress. The laws for the protection of the seats within the jurisdiction of the United States need revision and amendment SECOND HAGUE CONFERENCE.' In my last message I advised yen that the emperor of Russia had taken the initiative' in bringing about a sec ond pesce conference at The Hague. Under tbe guidance of Russia the ar rangement of the preliminaries for such a conference has been progressiag during the past year. Progress baa necessarily been slow, owing te tbe ' great number of countries to be ceav uueu upon every question mat nea arisen. It Is a matter o'f satisfaction that all of the American republics bare now, for the first time, been Invited te join in the proposed conference. ARMY AND NAVY. It must ever be kept in mind that war is not merely Justifiable, but im perative upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace can only be obtained by the sacrifice ef conscientious conviction or of national welfare. Tbe United States navy is the an rest guarantor of peace which this country possesses. I do not ask that, we coav tlnus to Increase our navy. I adt merely that it be maintained at Ita present strength, and this can be dead) only If we replace tbe obsolete and eat. worn ships by new and good ones, tCa equala of any afloat In any navy. Ta stop building ships for one year meansj that for that year the navy goes bad Instead of forward. In both the army and tbe navy there) Is urgent need that everything possible should be done to maintain tbe blghert standard for the personnel alike aa r gards the officers snd the enlisted atenw I do not believe that In any servtca there Is a finer body of enlisted Biea and of Junior officers than we have tm both tbe army and the navy, '""W-rj the marine corps. West Point and Annapolis already turn oat excellent officers. Ws de ast need to have these schools made mora scholastic. Oa the contrary, we eboet never lose sight of tbs fact that tta aim ef each school Is to tura eat maa who shall be above everytblej else a fighting maa. - .
