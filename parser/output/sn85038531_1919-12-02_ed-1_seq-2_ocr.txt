There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legiti macy of such measure. A I pointed out in my last mes- age, pumicity can gcconipljfh great deal in the campaign.

I would strongly urge its Immediate adoption, as it constitutes on of the preliminary step to thla campaign. I also renew my recommenda tion that the congress peas a law regulating cold storage, as It .la regulated. .for example, by the law of the state 0 New Jersey, which limit the' time which good may be kept In storage, prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released . front storage hal n all case bear the data of their receipt. It would maUrially add to tha aaunrlceablllty of the law, for the purpose we now have In view.

There can be no settled condition leading to in creased production and a reduction in the cost of living If labor and capital are to be antagonists In stead of partuers. Bound thinking and an honest desire to serv tha Interest of th whole nation, as distinguished from the intercut of a class, must be applKd to th ao , lution of till great and pressing : problem. Th failure of other na- . lion to consider this matter in a . vigorous wuy ha produced bitter, neas and 4eiouie and antagon isms, Uie food of radicalism.

The real antidote for the unrest which nutmtesu itself Is not sup. pressiou, but a deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our na tional life gud the application pf a remedy. Industrial Situation. Congree has already aliown Its willingness to deal with these In dustrial wrongs by establishing the elKht-hour day as the standard in every held of labor. It ha sought to find a way to, prevent child la, bor. It has serveH the whole coun try by leading the way in develop, ing tho means of preserving and safeguarding lives and health In dangerous Industries. It must now help in tho dltlloult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuinu .democrulixutiou of Indus try, based upon the lull recognition of tho right of those who work in whatever rank, to participate In some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare. It is with this purpose in mind that I called a coiilerence to meet In Washington on Due. 1, to con sider these problem in all their aspects, with the Idea of bringing about a better understanding be tween these two interest.

In response to hundreds of reguests for interpretation from every section of the territory east of the Mississippi ana souw or tne rotomac except the v irginias, wnicn is affected by the war. time regulations, the committee late last night leaued the following sum mary of its rulings: "Tho regulation apply allk to In dustries, stores and business houe, actually burning coal, oil or other fuel tn their planta and to thoae usina- elee- trle power, whether hydro-electric or steam. This question was given most serious consideration. The considera tion was based both upon . tha well known fact that moat of the hydro electric utilities consume a certain amount of coal varying with the amount of water power available, and upon the conviction that to make any exception would involve indefensible discrimination and endanger the whole plan of conservation, the execution of which Is Imperative for the safety of the country. In this connection it may be slated that hydro-electrle power now Is being diverted under direction of this epmmlttee from various points of production to distant communities where users are largely dependent upon scam-produced electricity and there fore, power saved by the restrictions at points or production 1 saving coal elsewhere. "Operation ef laundries and cleaning plants is consider essential from tha standpoint of public health; therefore the restrictions do not apply to such establishments.

New York, Dee. 2. Henry , Clay Frick, multimillionaire coal, coke and steel magnate, died at his home here at o:l a. m., aged 70. Mr. Prick aur fered an attack of ptomain poison ing a fortnight ago, but bad nearly recovered from thl when another and more severe illness developed This necessitated a consultation of physicians. Mrs. Frick and her daughter were at the bedside when Mr. FrlcK died, at ma city resiaence, Fifth avenue and seventieth street. Mr. Flick was a self-made man, rising from a poor boy to be con troller of. millions. He and Andrew Carnegie were two of the most out. standing figures .in the development of the American steel industry. The career pf Henry Clay Frick has formed one of the most fascinating chapters In the romance of Industry In the United Btates. At 10. a boy on a farm in a family of only ordinary means, he was, at (0, a man of so many millions' that his fortune, like tho of Carnegie and Hockefeller, was largely a matter of guesswork even to himself It has been said he was worth mora than $100,000,000, perhaps a much a $200,000,0. Mr. Frick built up the greatest coke business in the world, and aquired such vast interests in steel that he was also one of th. principal magnates in that industry, and in rounding out his career 4ie became known as one of the world's greatest collectors 01 master paintings, Mr, Frick was bdn Dee. 19, IUX at West Overton, Pa. This village was napied .after the maternal grandfather of Mr. Frick, Abram Overnolt, whose original family name was Oberholtzer, and who settled In western Fennsyl .yanla when that region was regarded as the frontier of civilization. Aa the settlements along the Allegheny and Monogahela grew, and Pittsburgh emerged from its swaddling clothes, Mr. Overholt became the leading miller and distiller of western Pennsylvania. Hi daughter, Elizabeth, married John W. Frick. a young man of Swiss an cestry, who at that time was working as an engineer in the Overholt distil lery. It was from this union that the future capitalist was born. The father atetmpted farming, but did not make a remarkable success of it and as a re sult young Henry Clay Frick was prac tically adopted into the uvornoit iamiiy when he was about 12 years old; He received a good basic schooling but there was nothing In his boyhood to indicate tho remarkable ability which charac terized his later life, except his eager ness to get Into business. For a time he was Bookkeeper in his grand father's distillery and from thitj, posi tion he went' to Morgan & Co., coke dealers, and at about 21 years of age he appeared in Pittsburgh as their agent. Tho coke industry was in its Infancy. The iron masters of Pittsburgh were Just beginning to appreciate the value of coke for their furnaces. Young Frick had an opportunity to acquire a limited Interest In a plant near Bradford, and out of the profits of th'i he aeauired other holdings. He later Joined a company to build a railroad to penetrate the (. onneisvlile cone region, and In 1871, the year this road was opened, Mr, Frick organized the cor poration of Flick & Co., which bought coal and coke ovens In the Conneis ville region. That was the basis of the Frick fortune. The undivided attention of the rising . financier was given to coke until 1882. ' During Panic ofzj. In the midst of this period there came the panic of '73 and the linancial j crash 06 ninny ambitilous operators. 1 At a sheriff's sale Mr. Frick purchased j additional tracts of cail land and ovens ! and a few years later the Mellons, pow- erfiil Pittsburgh' bankers, became in- tcrested In the expanding enterprise of tho young operator. I The Carnrgles, then developing their ' great steel business in Pittsburgh, had I taken large? holdings In the Frick Coke I company, and In 18S2 Mr. Frick found j the Carnegie brothers willing to admit him as a member of their firm in con sideration Qf his giving them further interests In his coke business. It was thus Mr. Frick became also a great manufacturer of steel. Through the Homestead strike of 1SD2, Mr. Frick came into national prominence. Differences had arisen be tween the Carnegie Steel company and. its employs over a wage scale, culmi nating n a strike involving thousands of men; the calling out of the national guard and the proclamation of martial law. It was at this periad, July 22, 1R02. that Alexander Berkman, a New York anarchist, tried to assassinate Mr. Frick. Berkman walked into Frick' oillce drew a revolver and ! tired, the bullet lodging In Mr. Frlck's ; neck. Mr. Frick was shot a second j timo and then he grappled with Berk- man. During the encounter Mr. Frick was stabbed three times, but he j downed his assailant and held him until the police arrived. Berkman was tried and sent to the Western penitentiary In Pittsburgh for twenty-one years. Thirteen days after the attack Mr. Frick walked to his ofltce unattended and resumed the direction of the great strike, which continued until Nov. 21 of that yeear. Mr. r rltjk was unmoved 1 by tho violence, the protests of the ! public or the distress of the families I of tho strikers. He won and never j begrudged the price of , victory. , When Mr. Frick entered the Carnegie 1 Steel company he decided to make it the most powerful concern In the steel world. Two of his Immediate ventures netted the Carnegie concern many mil lions of dollars without scurcely any I nvestmcnt. I I'b to this time the switchlnc charges between the various Curncgho plants j had been, very profitable to the rail- oads and expensive to the Carnegie i company. Mr. Frick built the Union i railroad to weld the scattered Carnegie i plants closrr together. This' eliminated ! the switching charges and saved enor- ! mulls sums for the Carnegie cpmpany. ! . na.i jir. erica who inter toox over! large portion of the Mesahi ore I fields on Lake Superior in a big deal hat guaranteed the Carntcle comnanv for fifty years a . minimum annual sud- ply of" 1.200.000 tons of ore, driving shrewd bargain with the Rockefellers who owned these ore land. Later Mr. Rockefeller conceived the proposition of buying out Mr. Carnegie I ntlrcly, ana In association with Henrv hlpps, the second largest owner of I stocks, and with the co-operation ot 1 11. Moore and others, Mr. Frick 1 sked Mr. Carnegie for an option on i his interests. Mr. Carnegie demanded 1 CI niA una for a nln-tv-dflv nnlinn u.wl 1 named 1157, foo, 000 in cash and bonds lor bis entini holding. This price, with 1 the additional cost of the stock of the 1 other partners In the Carnegie com- pany, brought the cost of Mr. Frick' ; scheme close to t230.0OO.00O. The mat- j ter was taken to J. P. Morgan, who was . not Impressed with the Idea. The plan . collapsed. Mr. Frlck's option expiring ! at a cost of a million dollars which : Mr. Carnegie pocketed. Thl wss the first failure Mr. Frick had ever known, but it was also a blow lo- Mr. Carnegie I for the failure of the Frick syndicate left him in the position ot having been 1 n the market with his holdings whlcn apparently ctiuld not be sold. Mr, Carnegie becuma very bitter and tried to oust Mr. Frick entirely from tli steel business. They developed a quarrel with many rumidcatious. . Mr. Carnegie sought W have tue board oi managers declare Mr. Flick's stock tor felted at par value. Mr. Frick replied with a suit for an Injunction to prevent Hits conliscatlon of hie stock, but tne case was llnully settled out of court by th reorganization of Larnegi company, wnich mad several PlUa burgUer millionaire over. mght. It made Mr. Frick on of the walthlet men in the country, but it was dis appointing to him later when Carnegie with the aid of Charles M. bchwab suc ceeded in interesting Mr. Morgan in tli scheme he hod previously rejected, and out of thU Interest cam the financing of the United Btates teeieor poration ln l'JUL By this again, Mr. Frick's fortune waa doubled. Hi 31, 000,000 Investment In tho Carnegie company was turned Into ,vl,00,u00 in the United State Steel corporation, although Carnegie had , stolen his thunder. Mr. Senwab was made presi dent of the steel corporation and Mr. cern. In 1901 times became hard and United States steel dropped to a low level. Mr. Frick then, bought everything he could In the way of steel stock and when th. excitement was over it was found he had acquired enough to be a power In that concern. HI Urst move was ot dethrone Mr. Schwab as presi dent, but W. E. Corey, another Car negie man, succeeded Schwab. Then Mr. Frick attacked Corey and suo cesded in having him removed, and Mr. Farrell, Erica's friend, waa finally made president of the great corpora tion. Breach Nevsr Healtd. Th breach between Mr. Frick and Mr. Carnegie never fully healed. A small instance of it was seen In Pitts burgh, where Mr. Carnegt built a large otllce building, naming it after himeeir, next door to which Mr. Prick built an other office building twice as large and named It after himself, Mr. Frick. in cldentally became one of the largest holders of real estate in Pittsburgh. In New York Mr. Carnegie built a magnificent borne and some time later Mr. Frick built an even more palatial residence on the site of the old Lenox library between Seventieth and Seven, ty-nrst stret. on Fifth avenue. It waa her that he provided for a Pic ture gallery which Is one of the largest, It not th. largest, private gallery In th. world. Jt contains some of the most valuable ana famous 1 paintings by Velasquez, Bembrandt, Gainsborough and other mastera. Many of these can. vases are eaid to hav. eost Mr. Frick several hundred thousand dollars each, Mr. Frick also maintained a beautl. ful summer horn at Prides Crossing, Mass. He was one of tha largest own ers of Pennsylvania railroad stock, was one of that company's directors, and Its dominating factor. He was also a power In Reading, Baltimore c Ohio, Norfolk A Western, and . other rail roads. , , On Dee. 15, Mr. Frick was married to Miss Ada Howard Child, Of Pitts burgh.
