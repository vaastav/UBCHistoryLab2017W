Washington, D. C Between 30,000 and 35,000 deaths and 2,000,000 injuries is the accident record in the United States in the last year among workingmen, according to a bulletin on accidents issued Monday by the Bureau of Labor. Of those employed in factories and workshops, it is stated that probably the most exposed class are the work ers in iron and steel. Fatal accidents among electricians and electrical line men and coal miners are declared to be excessive, while railway trainmen to 1,000.

It is pointed out that the possibili ties for successful accident prevention have been clearly demonstrated in the experience of foreign countries. "Granting," the bulletin states, "that the underlying conditions in European countries are often quite different and that many of our industrial accidents may be the result of ignorant, reck less indifference or carelessness, the fact remains that an immense amount of human life is wasted and a vast amount of injury is done to health and strength, with resulting physical im pairment, which has a very consider able economic value to the nation as a whole."
