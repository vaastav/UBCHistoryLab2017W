1 OTTAWA FREE TRADER; SAT U UD A V. DECEMBER 11. lbbO. . 1 , '-i r -- 1 r PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fcllow-Citizevs of the Senate and home of JieuresenUttkes: I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity or our country. By the favor of the Divine 1'rovidence we have been blessed, during the wast year, with health, with abundant liar vests, with prolitable employment tor all our people, and with contentment at home, and with peace and tneiidship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of the Chief Magistrate has af forded another opportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to the ...a,.i,i .i uiiTiiiiii:int. f vuiiinlu of the neace- iul and safe transmission of the power and authority of government from the public servants, whose terms of olhce are about to expire, to their newly-chosen successors. This example can not fail to impress profoundly thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which Republican institutions aliord. The immediate, general and cheerful ac quiescence of all gootl citizens, in the re sult of the election, gives gratifying as siiianre to our country, and to its triends throughout the world, that a government based on the free consent of an intelli gent and patriotic people possesses ele ments of strength, stability and perma nency not found in any otber iorin of government. Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyments of the rights of citizen ship, conferred upon the colored people bv the recent amendments to the con stitution, still prevail in several of the late slave-holding states. It has, per haps, not been manifested in the recent election to any large extentin acts of vio lent or intimidation. It has. however, by fraudulent practices in connection with the ballots,.with the regulations as to the places and manner of voting, and with counting, returning and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in de feating the exercise of the right preserva tive of all rights, the right of suffrage, which the constitution expressly conlers uuon our enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear. They prefer that no section of the coun try should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal-rights amendments to the con stitution is all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sec tional lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disregarded it is sal to assume that the people who placed them in the constitution, as em bodying the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to be wise and necessary, will continue to act together, and to insist that they shall be oneyed. The paramount question Mill is. as to the enjoyment of the right by every American citizen who has the requisite qualifications, to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly counted. With this question rightly settled the country will be relieved of the conten tions ot the past; by-gones will indeed be by-gones, and political and party issues with respect to economy and elliciency of administration, internal improve ments, the tariff, domestic taxation, edu cation, finance and other Important sub jects, will then receive their full share of attention. JJul resistance to and nullifi cation of the resuits of the war will unite together in resolute purpose tor their support all who maintain the authority of the government and the perpetuity of the Union, ami who adequately appreci ate the value of the victory achieved. This determination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of our country, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments rests upon the fundamen tal principle of our government. They are the solemn expression of the will of the people of the United Stales. The sentiment that the constitutional right of allourcitlzetiH must be maintain ed does not grow weaker. It will contin ue to control the government of the country. Happily, the history of the late election shows that in many parts of the country where opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment has heretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is likely to cease al together, if linn and well considered ac tion is taken by Congress. I trust tho House of Representatives and thefSenate, which have the right to judge of the elec tions, returns and qualifications of their own i nbers, will see to it that every casu of violation of the letter or spirit of the 1'ilteentli Amendment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benelit from such iolation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty ot the Kx ecutive, with sullicient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving cit izens of the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. It is not, however, to t forgotten that the best and surest guarantee ofYtho pri mary rights of citizenship is to bo found in that capacity tor self protection which can belong only to a people whoso right to universal suffrage is supported by uni versal education. Tho means at the command of the local and state authori ties are, in many cases, wholly inade quate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true where, before emancipation, the educa tion of the people was neglected or pre vented, in the interestof slavery. Firm ly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole count! y, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the government ot the United States, I respectfully recommend that Congress, by suitable legislation and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educa tion. ii tunds in the several states where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been devolved on uned ucated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands, and, it neces sary, bv appropriations from the treasury of the United Stales. Whatever govern ment can fairly do to promote free popu lar education ought to be done. V here ever general education is found peace, virtue and social order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are secure. In my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent necessity ot a reformation of the civil-service system of the government, ily views concerning the dangers of pat ronage, or appointments for jwrsonal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and ex perience in the executive office, and I be lieve these dangers threaten the stability of the government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of admin istrative service, as the growth of the country in population increases the num ber of oflicerb and placemen employed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of Oxed rules for the regulation of appointment, promotions ana remov als, establishing a uniform method, hav ingexclusively in view, in every instance, the attainment of the best q unifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights ot all citizens, and the most econ omical and efficient administration of the pobli3 busloJ. Competitive examinations, In aid of impartial appointments and promotions, have been conducted for some years pa3t In several of the executive departments, and by my direction this system has been adoptetl in tho custom houses and post otlicesoflhe larger cities of the country. In the city of .New York over two thou sand positions in the civil service have been subject, in their appointments and tenure of place, t3 the operation of pub lished rules for this purpose during the past two rears. The result of these prac tical trials have been very satisfactory, and have continued my opinion in favor of this system of selection. All are sub jected to the same tests, and the result is tree from prejudice bv personal favor or partisan influence. It secures for the position applied for the best qualifications attainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protection from the pressure of importun ity which, under any other course pur sued, largely exacts the time and atten tion of appointing officers, to their great detriment in the discharge of other olli cial duties, preventing the abuse of the service lor the mere furtherance of pri vate or party purposes, and leaving the employe ot the government, freed from the obligations imposed by patronage, to depend solely upon merit for retention and advancement, and with this constant incentive to exertion and improvement. These valuable results have been at tained in a high degree in the otlices where the rules for appointment by com petitive examination have been applied. A method which has so approved itself by experimental tests at points where such tests may be fairly considered con clusive, should be extended to all subor dinate positions under tho government. I believe that a strong and growing pub lic sentiment demands immediate meas ures for securing and enforcing the high est possible elliciency in the civil service, and its protection from recognized abus es, and that the cxperianee referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations in tho custom hous es and post otlices have been held under many embarrassments and without pro vision for compensation for tho extra la bor performed by the oiucers wno nae conducted them, and whose commenda ble interest in tho improvement of the public service has induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary re ward. A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to bo expected, and without an appropriation by Con gress for compensation, it is not practi cable to extend the system of examina tions generally throughout the civil ser vice. It is also highly important that all such examinations should ho conducted upon a uniform system and under gener al supervision. Section 1,7.": of tho re vised statutes authorizes the President to prescribe the regulations for admis sion to the civi.' service of the United States, and Tor this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to " the lituess of each candidate, in respect to age, health, character, knowledge and ability, for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter;" but the law is practical ly inoperative for the want of tho requi site appropriation. I therefore recommend an appropria tion of SU'i.ObO per annum to meet the ex penses or a commission, to be appointed by the President in accordance with the terms of this section, whoso duty it shall be 1 1 devise a just, uniform and efficient system of competitive examinations, and to supervise the application of the same throughout the entire civil service of the government. I am persuaded that tho facilities which such a company will af ford for testing tho fitness ot those who apply for office will not only be as wel come a relief to members of Congress as it will be to the President and heads of departments, but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrass ment which now inevitably and constant ly attend the conflicting claims of pat ronage between the legislative and exec utive departments. Tho most effectual check upon the pernicious competition of influence and official favoritism, in the bestowal of office, will be the substitution of an open competition of merit between the applicants, in which every one can make his own record, with tho assurance that h's success will depend upon this alone. . I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as free as any other citizen to express his political opin ions and to use his means for their ad vancement, shall also enable hi in to feel as safe as any private citizen in refusing all demands upon his salary for political purposes. A law which should thus guar antee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in tho public service, and likewise contain stringent provisions against the use of official authority to co erce tho political action of private citi zens or of official subordinates is greatly to be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of tho civil service, and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal, has been found to be the practice, under what is known as the spoils system, by which the appointing power has been so largely en croached upon bv members of Congress. Tho first step in the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce be tween Congress and the executive in tho matter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine, that " to the victors belong the spoils,' is inseparable from Congression al patronage as tho established rule and practice of parties in power. It conies to e understood by applicants for office, and by people generally, that the Repre sentatives and Senators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their respect ive districts and states. It is not neces sary to recite at length the evils resulting from this Invasion of the executive func tions. The true principles of govern ment on the subject of appointments to office, as stated in the national conven tions of the leading parties of the coun try, have again and again been approved by the American people, and have not been called in question in any quarter. These authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all important subject, are the statement of principles that be long to the constitutional government. " Under the constitution, the Presi dent and heads of departments are to make nominations for office. The Sen ate is to advise and consent to appoint ments, and the House of Representatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless offic ers. The best interests of the public ser vice demands that these distinctions be respected; that Senators and Representa tives, who may bo judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to office." To this end the co-operation of the legislative department of the govern ment is reqired alike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion. Mem bers of Congress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them with refer ence to appointments to office until, by legislative enactment, the pernicious practice is condemned and forbidden. It is therefore recommended that an act be passed delining the relations of members of Congress with respect to ap- rjlntment to office by the President, and also recommend that the provisions of section 1167, and of the sections follow ing, ot the reviaed statutes, comprising the tenure-of-office act of March 3, lstn, be repealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our coun try is one of the highest and most imper ative duties of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only by tho co operation of the legislative and execu tive departments ot the government, I again commend tho whole subject to your considerate attention. It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people ot the United States to suppress polygamy where it now ex ists in our territories, and to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Kxperience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed, the more difficult will It be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures aro necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy has the whole power of milking and executing the local legis lation of the territory. My its control of the grand and petit juries, it possesses large inllueiice over the administration of justice. Kxercising, as tho heads of this sect do, the local political power of the territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to the law of Congress on the subject of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of the law depends on those who practice and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the territo ries is ample. It is not a case of half way measures. The political power of tho Mormon sect is increasing; it controls now one of our wealthiest ami most pop ulous territories. It is extending stead ily into other territories. Wherever it goes it establishes polygamy and secta rian political power. The sanctity of marriage and the family relation are the corner-stone of our American society and civilization. Religious liberty and the separation of church and state are among the elementary ideas of free in stitutions. To re-establish the interests and principles which polygamy and Mor inonisni have imperilled, and to fully re open to intelligent and virtuous immi grants of all creeds that part of our do main which hits been, in a great degree, closed to general immigiatiou by intoler ant and immoral institutions, it is recom mended that the government of the ter ritory of Utah be reorganized. I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a Governor and Judges, or uoninnssioiiers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate a government analogous to the provisional government established for the territory northwest of tho Ohio by the ordinance of 17S7. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local government, I recommend that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries in the territory of Utah be con lined to those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it is believed that within a few years the evils which now alllict Utah will be eradicated, and that this territory will in good time become one of the most prosperous and attractive or the new states of the Union. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for con cern as to their continued maintenance. My anticipation of an early reply from the British (iovernineiitto the demand of indemnity to our lishermen for the inju ries suffered by that industry at Fortune Hay, in January, 1S78, which I expressed in my last annual message, was disap pointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of April in the present year, and, when received, exhibited a failure of accord between the two gov ernments, iu to tho measure of the inshore-fishing privilege secured to our lishermen by the treaty of Washington, of so serious a character that I made it tho8ubjeet of a communication to Con gress, lu which I recommended the adop tion of the measures which seemed to me proper to be taken by this government in maintenance of the rights accorded to our lishermen under tho treaty, and to wards securing an indemnity for the in jury these interests had suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations was under consideration by the House of Representatiues at the time of tho ad journment of Congress in June last. Within a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty's Gov ernment, renewing the consideration of the subject, both of the indemnity for the injuries at Fortune Bay, and or the interpretation of trie treaty in which the previous correspondence had shown tho two governments to beat variance. Upon both these topics the disposition towards a friendly agreement is manifested by a recognition of our right to an indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Ray, leav ing the measure of such indemnity to further conference, and by an assent to the view of this government, presented iu the previous correspondence, that the regulation of conflicting interests of the shore fishery of the provincial seacoasts, and the vessel fishery of our lishermen, should be made the subject of confer ence and concurrent arrangement be tween the two governments. I sincerely hope that the basis may be found in a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence ot views iu the inter pretation of the fishery clauses of the treaty of Washington, which, us the cor respondence between the governments stood iit the close or the last session of Congress, seemed to be irreconcilable. In the important exhibition of arts and industries, which was held hist year at Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at Melbourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorably represented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place re ceived a large number of awards in some of the most considerable departments, and the participation of the United States was recognized by a special mark of dis tinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by our country is no less notable, ami an equal degree of success is confidently expected. The state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed by all the nations of the conti nent ot Europe, has its favorable influ ence upon our diplomatic and commer cial relations with them. We have con cluded and ratilied aconvention with the French republic for the settlement of claims of citizensof eitfiercountry against the other. Under this convention a com mission, presided over by a distinguished publicist, appointed, in pursuance ot the requestor both nations, by his majesty, ttie Emperor of Ilrazil, has been organ ized and has begun its sessions in this city. A congress to consider means for the protection of industrial property has recently been in session in Paris, to which I have appointed the Ministers of the United States In France and in Belgium as delegates. The international commis sion upon weights and measures also con tinues its work in Paris. 1 invite your attention to Uie necessity of an appropria tion to be made in time to enable this (Continued on id page.) $m tjijcnlBcmciUvj.
