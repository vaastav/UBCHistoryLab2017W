THEMKTHODISTCONFEKKNCE I.st Day's Proceed I us-The Apptlnttnns for the Coming Year Announced Many Surprises and DUnpplinin-nf (Correspondence of The Messenger. Raleigh, N. C, Dec 6. Conference adjourned at 11:30 o'clock today, the closing and exciting part be ing the reading of the appointments. All along through the conference ses sion less information as to the appoint ments was known than ever before. It was all guess work with all preach ers and laymen, save the presiding elders, and of course there -were many surprises and disappointments. Below I give you the appointments. I see some papers state it is likely Dr. Kilgo will be transferred and take work with the general board of educa tion. There Is not the shadow of truth in this statement. I never knew the conference more united on Trinity Col lege in my life than now, and the fact that Dr. KMgo led the delegation to the general conference shows that con ference is with him In his heroic work for Christian education.

'Absent Com missioner Moore. The minutes of the last regular and special meetings were read and ap proved. County Attorney Marsden Bellamy notified the board that under an act of the last general assembly the board was required to elect a chairman at the first regular meeting in December of each year. Commissioner Nixon nominated Chairman F. W. Foster for chairman, and by request Commisisoner Alexan der put the motion and Chairman Fos ter was declared unanimously elected. Chairman Foster informed the board that he had intended ti present his an nual report but as he had not received the report from the city hospital he would make his report later. He in formed the board that the range, pump and radiators at the county home are now in perfect order; the jail had been whitewashed and the waterworks are being repaired. He stated that the city hospital had 'been supplied with some new furniture, beds, and bedding, the range overhauled, the repairs to the buildings completed, the old well which had developed into a stench pool, filled up and a well with a driven pump had been sunk affording good water. Chair man Foster also announced that the office of Dr. Wm. D. McMillan, superin tendent of health.in the old court house, had been furnished with a stove and the necessary articles asked for. Chairman Foster stated to the board that since the last meeting he had signed checks for $14,075 to pay off the county's floating debt, that there was now no floating indebtness, and that it was thouarht there would be sufficient funds with which to conduct the coun ty's affairs during the coming fiscal year endirg on the l3t of next Decem ber. He said the tax levy for county purposes was now within a fraction of a cent of E0 per cent le33 than the levy last year the levy being 32 cents on the $100 valuation against 47 cents last year. The poll tax charged against A. E. McKeithan was remitted, being a non resident, his residence being it Rocky Mount. Aaron Shepard arid John Asheley, colored, were exempted from poll tax 1 on account of physical disability, and Berkeley Williams, colored, on account of overage. William Usher, colored, of Harnett township, who is a charge of the coun ty, asked to be supplied with an ox, but action was postponed. The board declined to exempt John Low. colored, from poll tax, on account of his having lost two Angers on his left hand. Dr. Wm. D. McMillan, county sup erintendent of health, submitted his report for the month of November. During the month he prescribed for 248 patients in the health office and made eighty-nine visits to sixty patients at their homes. He says he finds the Jail : much improved since last report but ' still wants cleaning. Cuspidors should be placed in the corridors and halls. The average number of prisoners in the jail was twenty-seven. Dr. McMillan j reports that the county home is well kept and the comfort of the Inmates 1s strictly looked after; the food Is varied, abundant, clean, and whole some, and the quarters warm and com fortable. He state3, however, that the discipline is slack, and indulgent, too much so, and the general Indulgent management should be changed to something like discipline. The heater in the insane department, he says, is working nicely, but the heater In the main building i3 a thing of the past. If it were in working order we would have the most perfect, complete and be3t equipped almshouse in the state. After his report had been read Dr. Mc mlllan stated that Ed Fisher, colored, an escaped prisoner, on Sunday had at tacked and badly wounded Mr. James Noble, the foreman of the workhouse who had attempted to arrest him. Dr. McMillan said he had been called out to sew up a wound in the foreman head, and the whole thing had resulted from Improper discipline He recom mended that the superintendent of the home -be required to call the roll and account for the prisoners once or twice a day, and that better discipline be in augurated. He said he did not Com plain of the superintendent, for he was one of the kindest and biggest hearted men he ever knew, but he was too much so. On motion of Chairman Foster, Dr. "McMillan was authorized to draw up rules and regulations (for the govern ment of the home. Register of Deeds C W. Norwood submitted his annual report showing that during the fiscal year ending De cember 1st, he Issued 296 marriage licenses to 117 white couples and 179 to colored couples. During the month of 'November he issued eighteen marriage license and turned over to the county treasurer $17,10 In fe3 for the same. Colonel John D. Taylor, clerk of the superior court, reported that in the month of November he received $25 in corporation tax, for the charter of the Merchants and Farmers Steamboat Line. He also submited his annual re port showing that there are $2,617.91 of public school funds in his hands, in cluding trust funds. j The official bond of Colonel Taylor, clerk of the superior court, was tender ed, and was placed on file. The board however, entered upon the minute3 a statement to the effect that having carefully examined the bonds of the sheriff, clerk, coroner and constable and finding the securities unimpaired, they deemed it unnecessary for the officials to renew or strengthen their bonds. County Attorney Bellamy read a com munication from Bruce Williams, i Esq., county attorney of Pendar coun ' ty, demanding that half of tne sched ule B tax paid by Mr. Sam Blossom for account of Blossom's ferry over Northeast river, be paid to Pender county, as that ferry was between New Hanover and Pender counties, and was as much in one as the other. Accom panying the demand was a bill for $42.01, half of the tax for this year. . Upon recommendation of County at torney Bellamy, the demand of Pender county was rejected, Mr. Blossom, owner of the ferry being a resident of New Hanover county, and under the act of assembly he being required to list his. tax in the county of his resi dence. On application of D. G. Wesfbrook. Wm. Hansley was appointed special surveyor to survey land of Mr. West brook in Cape Fear township. County Attorney Bellamy Informed the board that tre superior court has decided that a fee of only ten cents shall be taken by the clerk for all pa pers filed in criminal cases instead of ten cents for each and every paper filed in such cases. He said thi3 would be a saving to the county of from $1500 to $1700. He though the state and coun ty taxes would in the next year be fur her reduced from 75 to 75 cents on the $100 valuation.

December 6 The Daily Tel egraph, commenting editorially on President McKInley's message, this morning says: "t used to be America's proud boast that sne had no foreign poricy. Judging from President Mc KInley's message, the New World Is no more free from the burdens of diplo matic negotiations than the Old. In a document of portentous length, mostly intended for Spanish consumption. President McKinley has devised a spacious prtext for gaining time. It contains passages that will certa'nly wound Spain's national susceptibilities. The whole one, though meant to be conciliatory, savors too much of the magistrate availing himself of the first offender's act to be very accept able at Madrid. Spain may not be so thick skinned as we are to these deli cate usages of America's diplomatic courtesy. Moreover, there are serious dangers of revolution In Spain and the indiscreet adjectives President Mc Kinley applies to, General Weyler's policy will not lessen the latter's pop ularity. Much depends upon the atti tude of congress. If, as our corres pondent thinks, the jingo is ts acquiesce in tne decision of the executive and give the Spaniard a chance, all may yet' be well, but recent experience does not make us over sanguine." The Daily Mail ays it Is "very satis factory that President McKinley comes out so strongly against the Jingoes." The Morning Post, Lfter paying . a tributne to the president's fine sense of duty, in the face of domestic troub le, in sending the message at the ap pointed hour, says: "The message adumbrates a scheme of legislative ef fort less short sighted and less calcu lated to set class against class than the misguided policy of last session. On the Cuban question the president is vague and diffuse, but studiously cor rect. Cuban matters, however, are un important as compared with the grave isssu3s of domestic affairs. The big battle of the session will be fought on the ground of home politics and finance." The editorial specially praises Presi dent McKinley's treatment of the cur rency question. It Is easy to catch a cold and Just as easy to get rid of it if you commence early to use One Minute Cough Cure. It cures coughs, colds, bronchitis, pneu monia and all throat and lung troubles. It Is pleasant to take, safe to use and sure to cure. R. R. Bellamy. L.viicli-d fr Mnnler Carson.. Nev., December 7.
