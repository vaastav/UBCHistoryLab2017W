WELLER NEEDED TO INFUSE ENTHUSIASM INTO PEOPLE Member of Pickwick Club Might Create Stampede To ward Concerted Movement to Liquidate Amount Required for "Ten Opportunities." It Is cjuite probable that Samuel VVeller. w<re lie to lioh up hereabouts lust about tills time, might be able Id Infuse enough of the Christmas spirit Into the people to create ft stampede toward a concerted move ment for the purpose <*t helping those who nre unable to help them selves through no fault of their own. All of us remember the fine obi Christmas party engaged In by the vnrious members of the Pickwick Club, down on the farm of the jolly old Mister Wqrdle, where Joe,, tin Pat Hoy, ate and slept away the valuable hours of his robust and cnre-for-nothlng life, and where Mis ter Snodgrass, Mister Wlnlcle, Mister Pickwick, Samuel Weller and Alfred ?Tingle made of life one great big chunk of care-free existence.. Where great red apoles bobbed about in tempting bowls of punch and boar's heads grinned at one through the steam of hot mince ides and plum pudding. Where holly berries by tho million peeked out through run ning cedar, and where, the warmth of the yulelog spread its comforts around, as the hunting party trotted In. fresh from the chase, sweating like race horses after a two-forty on tho track upon n winter's morning. Noted for Deeds of Kindness. It is but proper to say that the members of the Pick wick Club were noted for their deeds of kindness. They did not dispense their worldly possessions thro^*. "charity." This work was foreign to them. They spread happiness through sheer force nf pleasure. It did them good to d<\ something for some one. They proved lo the world that it Is better to give than to receive, and, as a consc rpience. they went 'through life as free from guile and as far from self ishness as they could possibly get. And what a life they led! Wher ever they went, bright beams of sun shine followed. In spreading their niirislmas spirit, they reaped their reward. No sleepless or restless nights for them. Observe Joe, the. Kat Boy! Always on hand when there were good things being handed around, and il might be added that he was, accordingly, "on hand" most of the time. And denr old "fJamlval." who sang and worked as he polished the gaiters of his mafiter and his fellow clubmen. Never a complaint; never an effort to shirk his little duties. Always anticipating the pleasures of those for whom h< toilet}. Ho profits moat, who a?rv? ? ;iti. >>*<>. *-v ; , Y..&V,uy?faii best, as the. Hotarlans would say'.
