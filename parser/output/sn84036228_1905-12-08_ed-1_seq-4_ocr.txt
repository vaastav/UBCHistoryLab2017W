THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. As was to be expected the presi dent's message is an aide and vigor- j production. He deals with all of ! the great questions and problems of the day in a torceful and lucid stjle. j leaving no doubt as to his attitud end desires doubt as to ms auuune Railroads, corporations, j labor. life insuranci currency. tin army and navy, public land laws, irri galion, immigration, civil service and | other questions, arc treated with at j length and the importance of legisla tmn in connection therewith is urged | upon congress. The message is of such great length and the many ques that tioiis are treated so exhaustivel we can only give excerpts bearing on them all. Those who accused the president of wavering in his attitude regarding rail load rate legislation will find nothin? to sustain their suspicions in his mes He says the question of Irans sage. portation lies at the root of all indus trial success, and the revolution in transportation which has taken place during the last half century lias been the most important factor in the growth of the industrial conditions. "Most emphatically we do not wish to see the man of great talents refus ée; the reward for his talents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized; but we do desire to see the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strong man shall be given no advantage over the weak man. We wish to insure as fair treat ment, for the small town as for the big city; for the small shipper as for the big ship per. In the old days the highway of commerce, whether by water or by a road on land, was open to all; it be longed to the public and the traffic along it was free. At present the rail way is this highway, and wo must do our liest to see that it is kept open to all on equal terms. Unlike the old highway it is a very difficult and com plex thing to manage, and it is far bet ter that it should be managed by pri vate individuals than by the govern ment. Bur it can only lie so managed on condition that justice is done the public. It is because, in my judgment, public ownership of railroads is high ly undesirable and would probably in this country entail far-reaching disas ter, that l wish to see such super vision and regulation of them in the interest of the public as will make it. evident that there is no need for pub lic ownership." lic ownership." 

CARTER AND DIXON. There has never been any doubt where Montana's Republican represen tatives in congress would stand wlten it came to supporting President Roose velt in his efforts to secure legislation for the government and regulation of railroad rates throughout the Unite»! States. Senator Carter's reply to the resolu tions passed by the Business Men's as sociation of Lewistown and forwarded to him, was laconic and to the point : "I trust it is needless for me to say that I was elected with and will cer tainly stand by the president and his administration." Congressman Dixon, upon his arriv al in Washington, was not long in let ting the country know where lie stood. He is quoted as saying that he "is first, last and always for President Roose- : velt and his policy." This includes the president's stand on rate legisla- 1 rion." Mr. Dixon further said that he j saw nothing to indicate that the conn i I .„ trv was anxious to have the tariff re . vised. He is of the opinion t»iat as there will lie a rate control tiill pass ed at this session of congress it would be unwise to tinker with the tariff at the same time. He says the country cun rely on the Republicans revising the tariff at the proper time and when occasion demands. Up to the present time Senator Clark has appeared in the role of the "artful dodger." He has refused or adroitly avoided making any lucid or positive statement regarding his posi tion on railroad legislation. His re ply to the resolutions of the Lewistown Business M-en's association leaves the impression that Mr. Clark unwitting ly or purposely misconstrued the word ing and meaning of them. Possibly, now that the president has again made 

PISO S CURE FOR M Uw dnuntixt. his position clear in his annual mes sage. Mr. Clark may give some expres sion to his views. Time will tell. It should afford the people of Mon tana and the west some satisfaction to know that they will have loyal champions in Senator Carter and Con gressman Dixon. The rate question may lead to a long debate in the senate and com promises may have to be resorted to before an agreement can be reached. Bui the president and his supporters are not likely to accept any that would render the law Ineffective in remedy ing the evils complained of. and in this stand he will be supported by the Republican representatives from Mon tana. j jj lr( j s () f ! gether but thev A 

NON-RESIDENT SENATOR. Montana is just now experiencing the evils attendant on having a non resident United States senator. Wil liam A. Clark of New York City and Paris has lately visited Montana for a few days. Since he received his credentials as senator from Governor Toole he has only made two or three fleeting visits to the state. In conse quence he is out of touch and sym pathy with the people of this state and unaware of their sentiments or desires on public questions of moment. His asosciations and sympathies are naturally with the railway magnates and the financiers of Broadway and Wall streets in the city of his residence. feather not only flock to talk together and have many interests in common. One j (( j tNew York millionaires might ma |< e a very efficient representative j j n congress for the financial and so | j lial classes to which he belongs, but he would be and is a misfit as a sen ator from Montana or any other west ern state. The interests dear to the hearts of Montana people are not at | a ]j identical with those of Hill, liar riinan, Kuehn, Loeb & Co., the Van derbilts. (lie Meonrdys, Hydes and Mo Calls. In fact, (hey are nmcb more : likp]y to antagonistic, | As a Montanian would not lie a fit 1 representative for Wall street inter j ■sis, so a New York railway magnate makes a mighty poor senator for Mon )ana j, j s y le humiliation of Montana j ( | iat s j u , | las jj'een Nevadizcd and is in , jm-ed by being misrepresented in th» I I federal senate by a New York Oily resident. Any non-resident senator would be an evil and a reproach, hut a New York City railway magnate and millionaire is the limit. Montana Dai ly Record. THF. 

HELENA MEETING. j The meeting at Helena to consider | I the question of railroad rates and pos I silily to form a state association for j the purpose of bringing about a j freight rati» schedule that will lie fa vorable to the interests and industries of Montana, will lie held on the 14lh iust.—next Thursday. If Lewistown is going lo have rep resentation tiler»» some action look ing to lhat end should lie taken short ly. The vacuum which the Montana Bus in» Men's League created in the state does not encourage connu unities far distant from the state capital to get wildly enthusiastic over efforts to form state associations. At least those interested want to feel quite sure that they are not spending their time and money for nothing when they attend i meetings for such purposes. I The prospect seems good tlir a large j attendance at the Helena meeting and j if any of the business men of I^ewis town can find it convenient to attend they should he authorized and equip ped with the proper credentials front the Lewistown Business Men's asso ciation. During the coming year the Great Northern and Northern Pacific will conduct eight dry land experimental farms in Montana. The farms will be under the immediate supervision of Prof. I,infield and assistants, of the state agricultural college at Bozeman, 'litree of the stations will be located in northern Montana, one at Harlem, on»» at Great Fnlls and another at Cut Bank. The appropriation for the pur pose amounts to $8,000—$3.000 from th Great Northern and $5,000 from I the Northern Pacific. The plan is to | , », I pay some person a salarj to take ; charge of the farm for the first six months. A »liversified crop will be planted the first year, of a small acre-1 aeh of potatoes, wheat, oats, bar Icy, flax, alfalfa and other grains which have been successfully raised in the state without irrigation and where (he rainfall has been light. Great results have been attained in Colorado in recent years by dry land fanning and the experiments in this Hate will lie watched with consider able interest. ___________ "Uncle Joe" Cannon, of Illinois, will again wield the gavel as speaker of the lower house of congress. John Sharp Williams, the Democratic nom inee for speaker, ami floor leader at the last session, will also attempt to guide his party over the shoals in the present congress. Mr. Cannon is one of the most popular speakers who ev er occupied the chair. While a stead fast Republican he is eminently fair with the opposition. But for his ad vanced-age» his name would be one to conjure with when his party is looking for presidential timber three years iience. Mr. Williams is a brilliant man but too erratic to wear the mantle of some of the Democratic leaders of the past. There was some intimation that he would not again be chosen for the place, but if there was any opposition i; was not sufficient to prevent him from assuming the leadership. President Roosevelt was the reclp ient of a 31-ponnd turkey for hjs Thanksgiving dinner. It came from that generous son of Connecticut who has been furnishing the white house with its turkey annually for lo, these many years. It would be no more than fair to give him the appoint ment of minister to Turkey. Congressman Tawney of Minnesota gives the mail order houses, who would designate patrons of rural routes by number, an indirect but stinging slap in this manner: "I know that we Rre living in the days of progress and prosperity, and that the new is sup planting the old every day, but to un dertake to identify the individual cit izen of the United States by giving bin a number is not in the line of Progress; it is rather returning to the methods of the ancient Grecian and Roman generals who, not being able to identify their soldiers in any other way, adopted the method which is now proposed to put into force for the pur pose of designating American citizens. In a Washington dispatch making mention of the nineteenth wedding an niversary of President Roosevelt, the Great Falls leader attempted to pro duce pictures of the president and his bride. In the haste to get to press the "make-up" substituted the likeness of Mrs. Grover Cleveland for that of .».rs. Roosevelt. Teddy has been ae eised of appropriating Democratic punciples and it seems the irony of late that the Leader should place the name of Mrs. Roosevelt under a pic ti.re of the wife of the only Democrat ic president in forty years. Things are getting badly mixed. The leader owes r.n apology to some one, even if Mrs. Cleveland is a beautiful woman. The Methodist society of Lewistown is to be congratulated over the re moval of its entire church debt, or the provision that lias been made for its liquidation. The building of the new difice was a large undertaking, per haps larger than was anticipated, but the society has one of the finest houses of worship in the state, one that will meet all of their needs for many years t i come. Evidently those who contrib uted so generously of their means were I moved by the scriptural saying, "It is I more blessed to give than to receive." The merchants of Lewistown are preparing for a heavy holiday trade. The public should see that they get it. They live here, pay raxes here, and contribute their share to the upbuild ing of the city and county. They j give generously to charity and in the maintenance of churches and benevo | lent institutions. Give them encourage ment by giving litem your trade.

Some unknown person hurled iron plumb bob through a window of one of the cars on President Roose velt's special train while it was pass ing through Philadelphia on the run from Princeton to Washington. A bob is not as bad as a bomb, but it is evi dent some one» was animated with a desire to injure or kilt the president. Ttte "City of brotherly love" evident ly contains a few people whom no president could please. The voters of Ravalli county were the first in the state to go on record as in favor of primary elections at an election held last week. Tile vote was light owing to the time of the year and the prevalence of a storm on elec tion day, but the proposition was car ried by a large majority of those vot ing. it it is true that the Havre conflagra tion was caused by ■defective electric wiring it is a matter in which all the cities of Montana should become con cerned. it is said that there are sev etal buildings in Lewistown that ueed locking after in this particular. Proposed Changes in Land Laws. Washington, Dec. 7.—At least two hills providing for important changes in the land laws will be introduced at tile approaching session of congress. On»' will provide for the repeal of the timber and stone act and the other will make it possible for purely agri I cultural land in forest reserves to be | acquired by settlers under the home I stead laws. Representative Lacey, ; c pairman of the house committee on public lands, will introduce botli of these measures into the house Getting Chilly. Tlte Thermometer—It seems to me you've sunk pretty low.

WILSON WOOD HEATER there is no occasion to remove a quantity of heavy ashes. The Hot Blast Down-Draft consumes every particle of burnable material in -the wood so that when the fire has burned out only a very small quantity of fine particles re mains in the stove to represent the impurities in the fuel which would not ignite. A piece of paper—a few chips and a stick of wood will enable you to have a roaring fir e in ten minutes, which fire may be maintained for 36 hours.
