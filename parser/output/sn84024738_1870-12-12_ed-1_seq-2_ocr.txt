Toe raai i Question at this time i? as to tbe point of the river at which it shall bo built. In a published letter, Colouel Bcffi.v, of Chesterfield, reviews the four routes that have been surveyed by Colonel Clakee, enpneer. and argues in favor of tae fourth, which crosses the river to the j Richmond side at the f?>ot of 9th stieef. in deed the three first named arc no close to gether that there is little difference between them. The first. Is .Mayo'* bridge, and the second and third will approach the Kich mend shore \ery ue/?r f>> Mayo's bridge one on the east, nr. J the other on the west side of it. in :Ue matter of cost, tbe foujth route has greatly the advantage. The Mtimate stand ? thus : jMayo*< *i:-4,oco No. s 121 ooo Ki'uU? So, S Ki>u ? No. 76,000 ITappily that which we think is tbe best of all the routes is cheaper tliau tho roo>t oostly of them by ?179,000, and cheaper t&au 5o. 2, the lowest of the lir>t three, by the sum of $40, wO, Col. ticFFiy a argument is conclusive, and there should uut be two opinious upon the subject. A tree bridge must end in abol ishing tolls tor crossing James river; and L a nee bridge were buili close to .Mayo's bridge it woutd end in two tree bridges so near each other that botb together wouiu have ouly the lacilities tn.it would be atioiU ed bv one. That of itself is suibeicut to settle' the question ; but then the economy of the route to yih street is another argu ment that is of itself conclusive. And yet it has otner most important advantages over any other. The rapidity ot tue flow of water along tbe sue of this route prevents the rise of water in a flood at that point to so great a height as below. For instance, in the iate fluod the rise iu the line of 9th street was only rune and a qu ^rlerftict, while at AIayo's iiridge the rise was ttcenly-tix and a quarter /ml ! Any oue can readily perceive the uuvuutugc of the position of tue route -.>o. 4. The foundation tor the pieis i>the best possible, and the bridge upon piers only thirteen feet above low water would be as safe as ?Mato'b bridge upon piers thirty feet high. But the bridge along route Xo. 1 would strike the very he-art of Richmond, while on tbe Manchester side it will in a few years be equally central. The teudency ol river towns is always up the stream. Richmond has in her growth moved thus., and if ever there is an exception to this rule, It is established that this exception cannot be here. The circumstances plainly encourage the growth of population up the river. i?o that in a few years the town of Manchester, for the want of this bridge ?cro>s to Dth street in Richmond, would be subjected to very great inconvenience. The fact is, the arguments are so im mensely in favor of this route that opposi tion cannot spring from any motive but sell interest or from any idea save the most con tracted. Whether we consider the scenen find the salubrity of the situation, or the practical reasons in reg*rd to cost, accom modation, and durability, the decision is all the world to nothing in favor of route So. 4. The building of the bridge on this route will secure another free bridge upon the ?ite of Mnyo's bridge. The building ol either of the two located near that bridge cannot possibly increase the public accom modation should Mayo's bridge uftenvards become free. We trust that those having control of the matter will settle the question iu favor ol the upper route. Fifty yeur6 ago a bridge was built on the site of this proposed bridge. It was a sort ol' phnk road? the pranks being nailed upon sills; fastened to the rocks by strong bolts. It was only a little above low water. This was Trent's bridge. It was niuoh of the time uudei water and yet its lower rate* so affected the business of Mayo's bridge that Col. 3iayc> deemed it his interest to get rid of its com petition by paying an annuity to Its ownei during his litetime. It is time that we had the pas?age-way across James river freed from taxation. On the two sides of the river, exclusive of the counties there are 70,000 people. We sup pose that there is not another case of such a population accumulated near the shores of & river like the James? not wider, and yet so easily bridged? payiug a tux for crossing it. If there is another like it, it should only increase surprise. One is ?nough, but it is no credit to this commu nity that that one is here in this locality, so favored by nature. The Gathering Storm. No observant man can mistake the sign' of the gathering storm of the political skies, The clouds and the mu/Ded thunder foretell the power and magnitude of the tempest that Is to wreck many who have braved the winds of popular opinion. There is no peace? no rest? in the con dition of public affairs. President Gbant lias madly, or stupidly, enti usteel himself to the guidance of the most bliud and ma lignant men? men whose history shows that they have fattened on the prejudices and rancors of the times, and whose only hope of being continued in office is in the promotion of the sectional passions, fan ning the flumes ot fanaticism, and keepintr alive the bitter prejudices engendered by Uie war. Even the President's Message is made the instrument of this atrocious pur pose. Almost its first paragraph essays to dignify the slauder of the southern States put forth by the lowest and most dishonest of the Radicals? that the freedman is ob structed in the exorcise of bi3 right to fote. The President's attempt, or the attempt ol some one for him? to fire the northern pub lic against the South must fail. A falsehood does not grow respectable by getting into a high place, but, on the other hand, becomes all the more monstrous when beheld so im pudently displayed. General Butlzb, who is now, if u bottled XXO," "bottled up" along with General Gsirr, seconds the President in his effort to inflict injury and humiliation with his amnesty bill, than which no more insulting proposition was ever made under the dis guise of clemency to a people. Yes, it is all the time the name thing. To humiliate the South and to make her people distrusted in every way is the policy of the ultra-Radicals, who have gotten control of General Geakt. They have promised from time to time to rive up this policy ** as soon as it oo aid be done safely "?i.e., as soon as It could be done with safety to the Repub lican party. But every year they fail to see that Republicanism is safe, and so they eaa't change their policy. The southern people must be ever convicted of cruelty to negroe*. The negro is the petted ape carried about by the Government, and which will, as in the fable, be at last drop ped fatally upon the rock* aud left to perish 1 by those who have never used birn out of I any true feeling of bympathy for him, but only for their own selflsli and detestable parti.*nn ends. In thin policy General Grant rocs back upon himself? abandons his liberal views one! schcmcs developed in his protection of Lbe find Ills followers from that jackal Judge UNnFRwooD, and his plan of the re storation of Virginia. He had the people with him in th?Hc. (or they were really in the line of pcaco and restoration of the rountrv. But. as he goes back on his own policy, the people will go against him. lie instructed his favorites in Missotirl to stand t?P against his Virginia policy ; bnt rbe people scouted his instructions, and maintained that policy. And so is the early Grant policy? de veloped under the wise counsels of Scho fjeld and Rawlins and encouraged by ieneial Sheruajj? adhered to by the be9t tnd most powerful communities in the Union. They think that 4< let us have peace " is a mockery, uuless there in some tbinc done honestly and sincerely designed to produce harmony, and banish sectional discord and distrust from the public coun sels and the nation. So we sec how people are dropping off from the war party and expressing their hostility to further penalties and vindictive policies, 'i he " new movement " in Vir ginia, origiually favored by Grant, has swept over the country. It was a move ment in favor of peace, equality, and jus tice, in all public administration, including taxation and disbursement ? equality in the burthens and the benefits of the Govern ment. In every particular the present Admin istration has discarded this liberal aud just policy. Distrust the South? heap up burthens upon the weak? continue the ex orbitant taxes? lot the capitalists still suck tiie blood of the nation? keep out the interest-bearing notes? non-interest-bearing notes would be better for the people, but not so pood for capitalists? and we must take care of the latter I Now here is a sum of oppression aud wrong? of opposition to peace and har mony?that may well enrage the people. They arc discontented, and growing daily more so. The storm is rising and spread ing, and will bur?t upon the incompetent and malignant officials and sweep them away. Good men are combining against the abuse of power and the war upon the peace and dignity of the nation. "What ever they choose to call themselves, their cause is great, and triumph they must. " Let us," indeed, " have peace." Mcsic.? We have from the publishers, Oliver Ditson & Co., of Boston, "All Alone," music by Professor W alter, poe try by " L. of Baltimore? the whole dedicated to Miss M. F. Hoffman, of Balti firnore. The mu-ie is plaiutively sweet and the poetry sweetly sentimental. The com bined influence will possibly do damage or crive great relief to some susceptible hearts. Composers such as the author of this songand sentiment lay under obligation s a large com munity of both sexes who are in the inter mediate period between "first love" and marriage. Safety-valves through which to pour out their sorrows and woes to the at tentive ears of theuir and woods are both mentally and mechanically of infinite ad vantage. Tliev are the best remedies for rhc congestive fever of love, and their au thors are beuefictors of mankind. Small.? We learn from the Annual Re port of Treasurer Spinner that the United states Government has made over $182,000 in the last seven years by deducting from each greenback returned to the Treasury for redemption (or renewal in kind) a sum proportioned to the part of the note which had been lost or destroyed. As the issuing ? if notes is so good a business, it would be well, perhaps, for Uncle Sam to monopo lize it. Gbeeley's Pluck. ? Hear him: "If the dominant Democracy of North Carolina have a right to be represented in Congress at all, they should be represented truly; and Vance, who six or seven years ? go exhorted them to <ti?ht the Yankees till hell should be so full of them that their legs would stick out of tbe window,' is a ui.iu alter their own heart. We venture to predict that he will be found by the Repub licans a more liberal and chivalrous antag onist th:in Horatio Seymour or John T. Hoffman." Again: "Ten of them [such men as Toombs, Ithett, Forest, and Jotin Forsyth] In the I present Congress would have insured us at least twenty more Republicans in the next: four or five of them from this State. Either we are inconceivably stupid, or this whole business of shutting rebels out of Congress, when there are constituencies eaj>er to send them thither, evinces an amazing lack of common sense." "We return thanks to Treasurer Spinneb for copies of his annual report. The Virginia Message ? Gov. Walker's message to the Legislature of Virginia isnn honest and dignified paper. It recommends a payment ot the State debt according to the letter and spirit of the promise, and dis plays a becoming resentment at tho very , t ricky course of the President In regard to I the peace of the Commonwealth. To ap preciate the- financial part of the message, it is necessary to know that, while thirty live counties were torn violently from tlie Old Dominion and erected into the State of WestVirgiuia.no provision has ever been made bv the former .Republican govern- , ments of the new Slate Cor the assumption j of its just share of the Virginia debt as existing at the time of the severance, and upon the parent State has been and is now imposed the full weight of the obliga tion. The effect of this has been to take population away at the same time that the debt owing by ihat population was lett be hind; and tb'at uuder these circumstances Virginia is advised that repudiation cannot even be thought of reflects credit on tli3 oflicial giving the counsel. As for tbe mili tary count, the Governor gives the facts as follows : That sundry negro settlements retused to move from* lands to which the courts declared they had no title ; that 011 the requisition oi the State Executive, as provided in tbe . Federal Constitution, United States troops were furnished to en force the writs, but were withdrawn before the process could be fullv executed ; and that, in response to a civil inquiry as to the meaning of this rather palpa ble hiut to the negroes to use violence, the President curtly announced that '? tbe order withdrawing the troops will be ad hered to." To supply a force competent to execute the process ot the courts the G ivernor therefore recommends the organ isation of the State militia, adding : u I cannot consent to subject the Common wealth or myself to the danger of any fur ther indignity by requesting the aid of Federal troops." Were it onlv that the earth may yield her increase, It is to be hopeu the State muy soon have a force of her own to make the laws respected ; for it there be one thing more- than another that cumbers the ground it is one of these squatter negro villages to bo found on the southern coast. Roosting or dinarily in tbe most fertile places? notably the Georgia and South Carolina islands, once so famous for the long-staple cotton, the finest in the world, and in Virginia on the best market garden tracts*? they are but so many caterpillars on the green leaf, an eye-sore, a nuisance, a ravage. To snore and to steal and to vote are the occupations of their inhabitant* ; and perhaps it is only b iuse of tbU latter avocation the Govern ment abets them in the other two, insult ing, in order to do ?o, the one single honest and respectable Governor who "presides, saving Alabama, over any southerh State,? A. Y. World.
