RANSDELL COMES BACK AT WILLARD By THOMAS C. SIIOTAVEI.L. New York, Dec. 9 Short coverings held the market firm to-day causing some further advances. Dealings were almost entirely professional. At the close of the session the stce! corpora tion announced nn Increase of 447,627 tons In the volume of unfilled orders on Us books at the end of November as compared with the end of October. This Is double what the street expected The banks showed a gain of $10,387,33) In ac tual surplus at the close of business Friday night. Deposits are reduced $38.- 281,000 and loans reduced J45,S53.O0O Great Northern Ore certificates and Wabash were the weak features. Stocks have been disturbed the past week by plans for reorganizing Wabash and Allls-Chalmers The disturbance was not caused so much by the Impor tance of these reorganizations as b the fact that they come at a time when business failures In general are so nu merous as to be startling The Novem ber failures are about the worst since 1897, and December failures promise to be fullj as bad both In number of firms and in the volume of capital. ClinnKc In Rnntl Control. On the constructive side of the market a deal was announced whereby New York Central gets tontrol of Ontario and West ern, taking It from the New Haven, which will take control of the Rutland Railroad from the New York Central This deal gives New Haven a direct line to Montreal and gives the New Yock Central a greater control over the an thracite business The deal cannot be consummated until the public service commission grants permission, and that permission has been asked Mone remained high, lending early in the week at 5 per cent and touching a high point of 5 per cent Friday. The msterious loss of cash reported by the banks the previous week was explained by saying that gold engaged for export to Canada had been subtracted from the cash In advance on the same principle that when a check is certified the certi fication is subtracted from the account against which it is drawn President Taft's message was favorably received by the street, particular! j so by Insiders of the American Tobacco Corn pan. The President's description ot the settlement of the Tobacco case as the best possible was heartily concurred In by the Tobacco people. Company Need Cnnli. WInslow S Pierce was made chairman of the reorganization committee for the Wabash road, and the Equitable Trust Company, as trustee of the mortgage, ex ercised its privilege of appointing a ma jority of the board ot dlreectors. The company is understood to need $10,000, 000 spot cash Kuhn, I-oeb &. Co are Interested In the reorganization plans. While the most conservative people In the street look for a further decline In the stock market, they attach great Im portance to the fact that there have been heavv rains and snows recently al' over the countrj. The government reports i slightly smaller planting of winter wheat but the dry weather pre vented or discouraged farmers from put ting In their usual acreage. This, how ever, will be made up with spring wheat and other crops, and the heavy rains, if the continue, will within three months wash out all trace of panic from business and the stock market b that time the radicals In Congress will have disclosed their worst Intentions and the conservatives will have had an oppor tunltj to show what they can do In the waj of settling the trust problem so as to encourage the resumption of bust ness ItEPORT OP THE

In the opinion or Representative Joseph E. Rnnsdell. president of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress "The return of the disastrous condi tion!) of 19C6-7. which seems to me ab solutclj certain if we depend solely on the rallwajs to carr our freights, is one of the main reasons why we are urging the improvement of waterwijs. ' said Mr Ransdell before leaving Tor Louisiana to take up again his campaign for nomination to the United States Sen ate In place of Senator Foster. "The fleet of barges on the Ohio and Mississlpi rivers carry coal from Pitts burg to New Orleans In quantities and at a speed which Is entlrel beond the rowers of the rallwas The development of the countrj Is being hindered b the Inadequacy of Its transportation facili ties, and can never go forward at full speed until our rallwajs ure supplement ed bj a great connected sjstem of water wavs "Mr W Illard appeals for a better un derstanding between the rallwas and the people. I suggest that one thing that would help toward this end would be for railway men to stop their opposition to the improvement of watertvay If there was any one thing plainly manifest at the great convention of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress just closed it wijsr a growing Impatience on the part of the business men of the country with the attitude of railways upon this ques- u.ierna3 existed before rail Quotations furnished br W B II lb 1 1 & Co , mesa en cf th New Tort Stock Exchange.

Athletes entering a race over a long course frequently run on the first part of the course at top speed in order to take the heart out of their opponents. Later, If the can hold out the speed all well and good. If not, they have a safe lead In which to loaf a little and catch their breath before the other run ner comes up. This is the sjstem some of the con testants for The Washington Herald's tour contest have adopted. Apparently their motto Is: 'Take the heart out of the other fellow K ou possibly can, otherwise the chances are they will try to take the heart out of you." Votes are going to come In by bushels In the next six days. The farther jou get ahead of the rush the easier sailing you will have. But don't get discouraged because some body hops ahead of you. Most of the big contests are won In an eleventh hour finish. A few thousand votes is a mere bagatelle. They can be won In half day's canvassing. It you have to start late, you can still go up to the lead If you work hard. Better start late than not start at all. There were many subscriptions taken for fix. months each along toward the beginning of the contest, which' are, .pros pects now. In many cases tho contest-' ants are renewing these subscriptions for six months, one or two jears. In some cases the subscribers are waiting to have the contestant who took their subscrip tions come back to them for longer-term subscriptions When their subscriptions have expired they do not want to miss a copy of The Washington Herald. Any person who subscribed for The Washington Herald after September 19 is a new subscriber. He Is privileged to extend his subscription for six months, or one or more jears. and still be a new subscriber The distinction between a new and an old subscriber Is that the "person taking the paper when the tour contest was announced. September 13. 1911, is an old subscriber, and the one starting the paper since that date Is a new sub scriber. N Extra Trip the Center. The extra trip to Europe offered by The Washington Herald to the losing candidate who makes the largest gain in votes between 10 p. m. November 23 and 10 p. m. December 16, Is the center to which eyes are focused by most of the contestants. Totes count up so rapidly; rthat It does not take a large number of subscriptions to run up. Into big figures. One more week of strenuous effort and thea U will be all over hut the, shouting; v Rlrhnrd . Dnbnrroir Dead.
