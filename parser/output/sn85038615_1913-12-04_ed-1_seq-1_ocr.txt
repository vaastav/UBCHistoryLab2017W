"The President of the United States." it was deemed appropriate by many of the speak-rs yesterday morning that such a conference should held in Virginia, "cradle of the Republic." and first settling pla> ??t* the English ?'olonlsts- It was Governor Mann who touched the keynote of harmony when lie said that Massachusetts, once the Northern part of Virginia, and the Old Dominion, had forgotten their late "mi pleasantness," and had become aligned again for a common cause. He was cheered to the echo. He referred, too, to the fact that for nearly 100 years the American-Canadian frontier of 3. M0 inlles had had no fortification on either side, no barrier between the two peoples to remind them of what many believe to have been a causeless war In 1812. Wanted No Mollycoddles. There was but one minor not* of discord In the proceedings, and that oc curred when Colonel George Brown, of Georgia, saying that ono of his fore bears had died at tho battle of King's Mountain and another Frazler's Farm, declared tho martial triumphs of the American people should not be for gotten In the celebration of peace, and that he did not want to see the country made a nation of mollycoddles. He said that tho children should be taught the military achievements of their fathers, and that, as for him, he was willing to meet any nation half way wilh tho olive branch, but that If a nation wanted something else, be was equally ready. There had been no Intimation that the glory of Ameri can arms should ever be forgotten, nor that military triumphs should not be celebrated in manner befitting ibem, as was explained by ex-Congressman W. ? W. Cocks, of New York, who replied to tho militant Georgian. "Wo are called In conference." said Mr. C'ccUsi, "to lay plans for tho cele bration of peace nnd constructive poli tics, not for destructive policies. And celebrating peace will not make of us a nation of mollycoddles. Tho re mark.': ji;st made are not germane to tho question at issue." Cnmidn Favor* Celebration. E. H.

He speakR of an unrest In business circles following the beginning of the special session of Congress in April, refers to a "pro- I paganda of pessimism. which designly or not. produced a condition of extreme nervousness and tension" and points to his anouncetncnt in June that tho Treasury was ready to issue $500,00'.', ??00 of emergency currency under the Ahirich-Vreeland act to prevent re-, .'?triction of credits and to ease any I situation.

After praising the psychological value ] <?1 these incidents, the report con- ' tlnues: "They demonstrate clearly that any improvement in our financial system which will permanently establish con lldence will in its- If be an immense gain, and if that improved financial system assures the opportunity to se cure at all times tho necessary funds and credits to meet the expanding and legitimate needs of the commerce and Industry of the country, it will be an achievement of enduring bene- . fits. "These incidents also show conclu sively tint enormous value of an al truistic governmental agency in the financial affairs of the country. So long as the government has the power to intervene in a beneflcient and un selfish way, the danger of panics and of unjust practices will be largely, if ' not wholly, destroyed. This is one of the chief objects sought in the pro posed reformation and reorganization of our banking and currency system. The people of the country arc: to be congratulated upon the early prospects i of sound legislation of this vitally im portant subject.

HUERTA IS FIRM j I IN HIS ATTITUDE I AGAINST YIELDING | Apparently Not Alarm* | ed by Enunciation of Wilson's Policy, PORFIRIO DIAZ ON ACTIVE LIST! Vigorous Denial That Military Peace Commission Has Been Sent From Chihuahua to Juarez to Treat With Rebels, Washington Is Satisfied With Developments. Mexico City, December 8.?Tho cnun i elation of Washington's policy appears ' not to alarm President Huerta. Ho 1 said to-day: "I have no Intention of yielding, j Should this fighting In Mexico continue i for years, I shall continue to do my I part in it If I am still alive." General Huerta declared that tho country was self-supporting, and that forced loans, if mado necessary, would enable him to resist Indefinitely. So long as ha was able to obtain American oil he did not regard the shutting off of native oil from tho railways aa vital. In official circles there Is vigorous j denial of reports that a military peace ; commission has been sent from Chi ? huahua to Juarez to treat with tho | rebels. In view of Huerta's repeated j statements that he never would treat (with the rebels*. It is not considered j likely that the commission was sane ! tioncd by him. Dlnx on Active Idst.

An outline of tho message delivered by President Wilson to Congress at Washington was prominently display ed by the newspapers to-day. Hud Knit It of Wilson, The Independent?, which Is controil : ed by the government, said: "The man at tho White House has | dared to affirm (against the truth uni versally conceded) that Provisional , President Huerta Is losing- sympathy j every day, and that his fall is to bo | expected. It was hardly belicvablo j that President Wilson would have the temerity to assert such a thing. He I thereby gives testimony of his bad faith towards things Mexican." 101 Paris, the most independent ??I! the Mexican newspapers, says: "President Wilson's words are so in jurious and depressing, and at tho name time the charges he makes against the Mexican President are so unjust that it is preferable to pass them by in silence, in order not to awaken anti-American sentiment in Mexico."

The proposal was that Huerta should arrange for new elections, reform rho government, and then resign the presi dency. In return, the Kuropean powers engaged to use their influence to in duco the Washington government to ; extend recognition to the Huerta ad ministration. ad interim, and to guar j an tee whatever funds might be need ed for the process ot" pacification and reconstruction. lliiertu ncJeolM Propositi. This plan is said to have been viewed with such favor by Huerta that ho went so far as to commission Dr. I'rrwtia, president of tho Senate, to form a new Cabinet. When the plan was laid before tho Cabinet, however, Sonor I.ozano, who is rabidly anti-American and an na~ trcmely persuasive orator, In un im-> j passioned speech urged Huerta. in tho name of his country, not to submit to ? such an undignified and unpatriotic) plan, which would mean another tri umph for the I'nited States and indig nity for the whole Mexican nation. ? Huerta, after listening to this address, is said to have decided to reject tho . proposal. News of a sharp engagement between a detachment of Federal troops and a band of Zapatistas at Topiljo, only 1 twelve miles from the capital, two days ago. was made public to-day by tho War Office.

Washington, December tf.?Govern ment officials here were more than eve? confident to-day that the patience tho I'nited States has shown in its treat ment of tho Mexican problem is soon to be rewarded by a solution brought about by operation of the Internal forces now engaged in a final struggle in Mexico. Among the facts which form the basis of belief that the closing chapters of the Huerta regime are now being writen is a report to the State Depart ment that the Federal troops are no longer in receipt of their pay, without ) which experience has shown their loy alty is uncertain. Other reports regarded as indicating the speedy triumph of the Constitution i alist forces aro the precipitate flight of the heads of families which have con trolled vast estate* in Mexico.
