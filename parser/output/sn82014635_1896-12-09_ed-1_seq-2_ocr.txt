DATS UICYCIiE RACE Continuous Becord ot the Second Ray of the Contest. New York, Dec. 8. The great throng which until this afternoon cheered the? wheelmen in the six-days international cycle contest now being held In Madison Square Garden, were repaid for thr-ir hardihood in facing a stiff wind and a nasty mist which fell during the day. When the band began playing at S o'clock the riding was most spirited. Teddy Hale, the young son of Erin, had Just scored his 703d mile and Hice 1 ad B63 miles to his credit. Schoch, during the hours between 6 and 7 o'clock, did Feme very fast riding. Pierce, who had been sleeping between 5 and 7 o'clock, came on the floor refreshed and went to work and soon jumped ahead of Elke, and it soon became apparent that he in tended to crawl up on some of the favor ites. For a long time before the galleries began to assume an air of life, the riders had been doing some fast riding. Little Taylor, the darkey, carried a grin that was amusing as he bent far over hiu handlebars. Sate rode steadily and did not appear to exert himself, as did Rice, Who has been slowly creeping along.' Throughout the evening the riders braced up, smashing world's records. New York, Dec. S. The opening of the -second twenty-four hours of the six days yicycie contest at .Madison Square Gar den found the roll of the competitors sadly depleted. Of the original twenty seven entries only sixteen remained and It was good betting that less than half of this number would be in the race at the finish. Hale, the Irishman, who had led since yesterday afternoon and broken record after record, was fresh and hopeful of success this morning. He took a little nap during the early morning, but man aged to add seventy-six miles to his credit between 3 and 9 o'clock. Experts at the garden said, however, that he would not last the six days, albeit there was nothing in disappearance this morn ing to warrant that assertion. Redding, the Nebraska man who broke all records yesterday for continuous rid ing, was within a score of miles of the Irish champion at 9 o'clock but gave evi dence of breaking up. "Major" Taylor, colored, at that hour bade fair to capture first money. He was within thirty-two miles of the lead vr at 9 o'clock and seemed as fresh as when he started. Maddox. of Asbury Park, was over 100 miles behind the ieader this morning. Moore of Bhiladalphia, was In much better condition than several of his com petitors. Shock, the winner of the last six days contest, proved a disappointment to his friends and his withdrawal at any time would have surprised no one. The chances of dick. Cannon, Cassidy, Smith. Pierce, Ashmger and McLeod were slight All the fifty mile records had been broken and Shock's record seemed likely to be beaten by 200 miles. The score at 10 a. m., was as follows: Hale. 316; Redding. 526; Moore. 524; Tay lor. 543; Schock. 517; Ashlnger, 399; Rice 525; Pierce, 505; Foster, 51S; Elks, 456; Smith. 465; iladdox, 436; Cannon, 420 Cassidy, 423; McLeod, 355; Glick. 447. Hale turned into his tent shortly after 9 o'clock. He was out again at 10:15 and made the pace for the adversaries. Al Shock made a gain of twenty-three miles over Hale this morning. Comparison with the previous contest found the Irish man only seven miles ahead of Shock's record of 533 miles at the end of the first thirty-four hours. "Major" Taylor sought rest tor ninety minutes, during which time he was pass ed by Shock and fell from third to eighth place. Glick, the Michigan man. was run into but re mounted and continued his ride. Cassidy, the "Jersey student," left the track at 11:55 seemingly badly used up. Hale continued to break Shock's previous record and at the end of the nrsi tnirry-six ftours he was fifteen miles ahead of it An hour later he increased his lead to seventeen miles. The best work today was done by Rice of Wilkcsbarre. Pa., who covered a dis tance of 193 miles between midnight and 1 o'clock this afternoon and seemd as fresh as any of them. He was within twenty miles of Hale and led all the others by from seven to ninetv mile. About 2 o'clock Maddox, who had "been going along steadily all morning, let out a link or two for a couple of miles and parsed his adversaries as if thev were standing still. At 12 o'clock the core found Hale twenty miles and three laps ahead of all previous six-day records to Ihat time SS hours. At 6 o'clock the score was: Hale 671 allies; Rice 651; Schoch 639; Forester 63S Moore 631; Reading 626; Taylor G16 Pierce 667: Smith 5S7: Elkes 551: Glick F4; Maddox 540: Ashinger 526, Cassidv 23: Gannon 500: McLeod 416.

CUBAN LEADER LOST (Continued from First Page.) bans, on the other hand, have reported his crossing as in defiance of the alleged security of the Spanish line. Maceo has from time to time, stated to those sup posed to be in close communication with him that he would cross the line when it should be time for him to meet General Gomez again in Havana or Matanzas province. "Aoccording to the recent dispatches. General Gomez was In Santa Clara pro vince, near Matanzas, with his extreme vanguard already near Havana itself. Some of his men are said to have parti cipated in the raid on Guanabacoa just across the bay from Havana on Dec. 1.

President Cleveland's message caused a depression on the; bourse, and the newspapers, especially those of the opposition, and the indepen dent oigans, expressed the greatest ir ritation at America's interference as a humiliation for Spain. The government organs are more reserved in their tone, and they even express some satisfaction at the unexpected moderation which President Cleveland has shown. According to the Heraldo the cabinet 'will meet today to discuss the text of the message. The Military Correspondencia, the or gan of the army, says Spain will be mere than strong enough to punish any inter ference by the United States with her af fairs. Other newspapers characterize the message as provocative not only to Spain, but to the whole of Europe. Paris. France, Dec. S. The Journal des Debats, commenting on President Cleveland's message to congress, says: "The message is an act of courage, and Spain can only be grateful to President Cleveland for giving Oier another lease of tranquility in order to conquer the rebellion. It indicates clearly that Presi dent Cleveland will veto any proposition for the recognition of the Cubans during his term of office." HOT 

ROAST FKOJI MEXICO Cleveland, Timid and Mercenary; OIney, Cold and Unsympathetic. City of Mexico, Dec. S. There Is keen feeling of disappointment here the Presi dent Cleveland could not see his way to recognize the belligerency of the Cubans, for Mexican sympathy is undoubtedly with them and this country and most of the Latin-American republics are, with the possible exception of Chili, ready to follow the lead of the great republic, and today it is said here that McKinley will take no more generous attitude. The Mexican Herald saysr "President Ceveland's attitude toward Cuba is an other instance of 'let alone I dare not; wait upon I would.' He shows sympa thy for the Cuban patriots, but agrees that they have abandoned even the pre tense of government in those portions of the island that they occupy and he con tends that the inefficient semblance of authority kept by Captain General Wey ler is still there is of a legal and consti tutional government in Cuba. The com mercial reason for non-recognition of the Cubabns Is shown in his statement that almost fifty millions of American capital Is invested on the island which would be jeopardized by according belligerent rights to the Cubans, for. asnatters now stand, the damages sustained by Ameri can investors in Cuba constitute valid claims against Spain. In a word, there Is a Gordian knot within reach of the president, and he will not cut It He Is plainly cOntroled by the advice of his secretary of state. Mr. OIney. who is a cold and calculating lawyer, a man who has led the president to take a tiff and unsympathetic attitude toward the Ar menians. How much weight such estate holding Interests of New England have had in the councils of the government a Washington, one may easily discern, but the nresidents messaee will suit that re- stricted and comfortable group who .pre fer dollars to the recognition of Cuban belligerency ihat might imperil the se curity of damages later on. The Cubari patriots will have to await the action o President McKinley, and Latin-America, which, with practical unanimity, will follow the example of the United States, must patiently abide the change of ad ministration at Washington." 

MORE LONDON COMMENT John Boll is Ordinarily Philosophical Over Other Folks' Trouble. London, Dec. S. The Pall Mall Gazette this afternoon, commenting upon Presi dent Cleveland's message to congress, says: "There la" nothing in the message un satisfactory to Great Britain, so far as Cuba is concerned. - President Cleveland is neither diplomatic nor politic. His language will please neither Spain nor the insurgents." The Globe sees in the message "Mon roeism thrusting itself forward In the usual menacing fashion," and doubts if McKinley will be "grateful to his prede cessor for bequeathing the task of bully ing Spain." The St. James Gazette contrasts the "polite, cautious tone" of the message with the "minatory message of a year ago on a similar topic," and says: "The condition in Cuba undoubtedly gives the United States the right to call upon Spain to enforce her authority very speedily or acknowledge that her inabi lity to suppress anarchy has deprived her of her right to be considered as gov erning the island." 

FAI.UA ANAtTZES THE MESSAGE Declares That Cnba is Resolved en Free dom, Help or no Help. New York, Dec. S. At the office of the Cuban junta in this city. Thomas Estra da Palma, delegate of the Cuban repub lic to the United States, gave out a statement today in which he expressed his views of the president's message so far as it related to the Cuban question. He says the message, generally speak ing, is in a great measure very depres sive to Spain as an independent nation, as it declares that Spain has no control over at least two-thirds of the island; it acknowledges the grievances "which have led to the present revolt of the Cu bans against the authority of Spain, and support, the Cubans in their distrust of any promise whatever Spain can make to them and pledges the guaranty of the United States as security for any en gagement which Spain may enter upon with Cuba. President Cleveland, he con tinues, finally declares, without hesita tion, that the patience of the United States in waiting for Spain to end the contest has a limit; that the obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be sup erseded by higher obligations and that considerations of .humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile country, inti mately related to the United States, sav ed from complete devastation, will sub serve the interests thus involved and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace. As to the inference contained in the message that the Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise its functions, Mr. Palma cites recent acts of General Gomez in fulfillment of ord ers, to prove that the civil government of their republic commands the respect and obedience of the military authori ties. Mr. Palma says it is idle to talk of autonomy for the Cubans and says: "They have framed a constitution for a sovereign nation," The atrocities practiced by the Span ish in the present war, he continues have deepened to such an extent the political abyss between Cuba .and Spain that it is absolutely impossible to fill it up with any sort of scheme which does not affirm the absolute independence of the Cuban people. Cuba has decided to get rid of forever Spanish rule and her people count neither their enemies nor the many patriots who daily succumb to the struggle. They go on, confident in the justice of their cause, the firmness of their resolution and the protection of God They realize, of course, that they are In the very center of free America, left. alone to themselves, without a hand out stretched to them; but, far from being discouraged, they feel convinced of their ultimate success.

Washington, Dec 8. The most notice able (feature of the Republican senate fcaucus, which assembled today, as seen from the outside, was the absence of the men who had bolted the nomination of McKinley, because of the gold standard platform. Those who were absent on this account were Senators DuBois, Pet tigrew. Mantle, Cannon, Squire and Teller. All of these except Senator Teller were in the city, and could "Have attend ed if they had been so disposed. Indeed, some of them were in their committee rooms in the capitol while the caucuB was in progress. DUBOIS RESIGNS. That their absence was intentional was cleaily shown by the following letter, which Senator DuBoia sent to the caucus and which was read soon after the meeting was called to order by Sen- tor S'herman: "United States Senate, Washington, D. C, Dec. 8, 1896. "To Hon. John Sherman, Chairman Cau cus of Republican Senators, Washing ton, D. C. "Sir 1 hereby respectfully resign my position as secretary of the caucus of the Republican senators. I also resign my position as a member and secretary of the Republican advisory, or steering committee ot the senate "Very truly yaurs, (Signed.) "FRED T. DUBOIS." The bolters Had all received invitations which were sent them as if they had never left the party, but they had de cided not to attend. They had found it impossible to communicate with Senator Teller, who has not yet reached the city, but all expressed confidence that if Tiere he would not have gone into the conference. NINE ARE FAITHFUL. If the bolting' silverites were conspicu ous by their absence, the silvermen who remained within the party were, as a rule, exceptionally prompt in their at tendance. Senator Carter, who, while here, refused to accept the Dlngley tariff bill, and yet refused to walk out of the St. Louis convention, was the second man to enter caucus chamber, and he vwas followed closelyby Messrs. Wolcott, Perkins, Mitchell, Shoup, Hansbrough, Cameron, Pritchard and Clark, who heretofore have always voted for silver, when the question wag before the senate. There were no long speeches In the caucus, ana very lew speeches or any character. Senator DuBois' tendered resignation was received without a word of comment. "We jut closed up the ranks and marched on," said one of the partici pants in referring to the incident after the close of the meeting . There wasno formal motion to accept the resignation, butt taking its accept ance as a mattetr of fact. Senator Lodge moved the election of Senator Wilson of Washington in his stead as secretary, while Senator Shoup was placed on the Steering committee in the place vacated by his colleague. This committee was also enlarged by the addition of the name of Senator Hansbrougfo of North Da kota. DINGLEY BILL REFERRED. The Dingley tariff bill was referred to the steering committee, with instruc tions to investigate as to the likelihood of.gettlns,-ihA,bill through and to devise a means to that end, if possible. It was the prevailing opinion that the best policy demanded the passage of the bill if possible to encompass it, but the 7 opinion seemed to be quite as general that this result was not witfcSn the range of possibility. The entire question was referred toi the committee, with very liberarl powers. Senator Gear brought up the Pacific railroad question, as did Senator Lodge the immigration bill. The Pacific road bill was referred to the steering commit tee, but after Mr. Lodge had explained the status of the immigration bill the caucus desired to stand by that as a party measure and to press for its early consideration. The caucus also decided for an inter national agreement on silver by agree ing to the following resolution, intro duced by Senator Wolcott: "Resolved, That a special committee of five members of this caucus be appoint ed to recommend soma plan whereby legislation may be had In this session of congress looking to an international conference with the leading commercial nations of the world for the promotion of bimetallism." AS GOOD AS DEAD. Washington, Dec. 8. The action of the Republican senatorial caucus in refer ring the Dingley tariff bill to its steering committee and. the circumstances under which this action was taken are accept ed in the senate as practically the end of the agitation in the interests of the measure. The debate in the caucus de veloped that there were) wide differences as to the advisability of attempting to pass the bill, even among the Republi cans, and the opinion was expressed by some who were on the Inside that fully one-third of the Republican senators, not including the silver bolters, were an tagonistic to the bill.

WHO COMMANDS THE FRENCH Carat Ceatasanslen aad Dlrlsloa Generals Hold Equal Baa. According to the regulations the min ister of war is commander im chief of the Fiench army. But an act passed in 18SS 1 provides tha.t this high dignitary must remain in Paris if a war breaks out. The actual command will be assumed hy a major general designated for that purpose by the ministry at present Gen. Saussier. Well and good. But this officer has no right to prepare the army according to his ideas in time of peace:. He receives the command orer the differ ent corps from another man, with whom, perhaps, he differs materially in opinion. The responsibility :for the state of the army is thus divided and cannot be fastened upon any one person. Further, the highest rank in the French army is that of division general. There are some higher functions, such as the command of an army corps and he army inspection, but these functions are attended to by the division, generals, who stand in the same rank-with their inferiors in command. In times of peace this causes unpleasant jealousy, during war time it may lead to conflict and disorder. With (regard to the com manderso"f army corps the matter is not so bad, as they are in touch with troops and leaders under their commands. But how is a general to command an army if the chiefs of four or five army corps and some 20 divisions all hold the same rank as himself? Will he be obeyed? ' The impropriety of this state of things is well known to the French, but the conditions of the republic exclude the possibility of suitable reforms. If any general were given an extra feather for his hat or aa extra star on. the collar of his cootie might use his new authority against the republic. On the other hand, the hundred or so of division generals hold each other in check. Yet, the re sponsible heads of the army fear that serious difficulties will arise in case of war, and the present minister of war has drawn up a bill for the mitigation of the evil. He suggests the appoint ment of a responsible council of war and the creation of a new rank, that of "army general." Twenty-nve of the division geaerals are to be raised to it, and they must be chosen from the offi cess who already act as army connand ers and army inspectors. It is, however, doubtful that even this moderate reform. will be allowed to pa3 the chambers. Already the radicals and socialists raise a. row and declare that Billot is preparing for a coup d'etat. On the other hand, the military press points out that it would be much better to give tie future commanders of armies a higher hierarchic position and to en able them to exercise some power over the troops they are to lead in time of war. But the military authorities un derstand that, if 25 commanders are raised to higher rank the present diffi culty in the appointment of chiefs is at least narrowed down. More radical re forms wonld be likely to meet with still greater opposition than the proposition which Gen. Billot has formulated with the assistance of his civilian fellow min isters.

"On my first circuit I had a lesson m human nature that I hare never for gotten," said a Methodist minister to a Washington Star reporter. "The circuit was in the mountains of West Virginia, and among the members of my church, was a. widow, who, in ad dition to the loss of her husband, had suffered final earthly parting with four of her children, leaving but two, a girl and a boy nearly grown. "One night I was asked to hasten to her cabin, which I did, reaching there ust in time to be with her son wheaho died from the effects of an accident. "The mother, although deeply grieved, acted more calmly than I pected, and early in the morning I went home, returning in the afternoon I found the widow in the paroxysm of tears. I tried to comfort her with the usual Christian consolation. Finally she quieted down enough t say: " "Tain't only thet ho died. I know he's a heap better off. "'What is it, then?' " 'We tain't hev no i uaeraL "'No funeral?' " 'No. Sal's jess, got back from th fito', an' not a ya'd o' black hev they got. I never did 'tend no funeral 'thoutblack, an' I ain't goin' ter 'tend now.

OLD-TIME SOUTHERN SPORT. Members of nnatlns; Clabs as Wheat Bis; Flaes Wore Imposed. Among tho sports of olden times the hunting clubs were prominent e cry where, says the Atlanta Constitution. In Camden county one of the mast fa mous of clubhouses in this country was built at Bear Uammock and kept under the supervision of Gen. John Floyd. It was there that the Camden County Hunting dub organized in 1632, held its meetings, made ite rules and imposed its fines. The charter members of the club were Charles R. Floyd, Richard Floyd, Henry Floyd John Floyd, Ben Hopkins, J. H. "Dilworth, James Holzendorf , John Holzendorf, Alexander Holzendorf, P. M. Nightingale, William Berrie and Henry du Bignon. Several members Joined afterward. The club dress was a scarlet jacket and black pantaloons and a fine of 500 copper caps was im posed on Alexndcr Holzendorf at one meeting for not having on the regula tion dress. Xo member was to be ab sent from the meetings unless by good excuse, and James Holzendorf was fined 1,000 copper caps for one absence. After the day's hunt, sometimes with the luck of 16 deer, an elegant dinner was served before dispersing. The 16th rule read: "Game is con sidered by the club to be deer, bear, hogs,cows,bulls, wildcats and turkeys." Wild cattle aad bop abounded in the woods in those days, the latter living to an old age, which was told by the tusks, sometimes eight to tea inches long. PASSING OF THE FAKE AUCTION. Oae Kind of Bnslnes That Is Tlaaallyaad Frnaaaestly Suspended. Where, has the jewelry auctioneer gone?

Grass will grow on a railway be& U the ties are covered with soil and &ee4 sown, rhis can be verified by a visU to the Fairmoimt park trolley line nea, the Belmont avenue entrance. This sec tion of th track reaembles two parallel rails laid through a green meadow, and the presumption is that the railway management intended to aaako the en tire track from end to end like it. If the grass can be kept green in dry as well as wet seasons he presence of the track will hardly mar the landscape at all. Even the poles aad trolley wire are not as unsightly as the electric light poles and wires which have been al 1 lowed to disfigure the park in every di- J rection. There i a possibility , of I course, that the graja between tb tracks may prove a hindranc to tht operation of the line even if it is orna jnental, but this is hardly probable ii the grass is kept well mowed. A rail way line with no ties in. sight aad can peted with a luxuriant greensward wilj be a novelty at least. FhuaJtlphiil Times, rraesfas; Air.
