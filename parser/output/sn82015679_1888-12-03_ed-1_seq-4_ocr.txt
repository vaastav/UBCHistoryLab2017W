As A "great movement" Adjutant-general Koontz's new veteran organization appears to be a failure. The closer it is looked at the imaller it grows. TllE second and last session of the Fiftieth Congress will convene to-day, and receive the President's message on the state of the coun try and his own feelings. Belva Lockytood received two votes in Kentucky. Oce of them might have been cast by Mr. Wattereon in one of his moments of general disgust with the administration; but whose was the other, the star-eyed being disfranchised? Reports from New Mexico indicate that Mr. George W. Julian is an official who should be called home early by the coming adminis tration. Indiana does not want him, but New Mexico Trill not have hira, and this un fortunate State will probably be corapelied to submit to his return to its "midst." Speaking of Prohibition in Rhode Island, the Providence Journal says: "The saloons are quite as open, more numerous and more mischievous than they were under the license system." As a means of regulating or re straining the drink evil and the liquor traffic, general prohibition is a questionable method. Local option is the key to the situation. Mr. "Williamson, of Philadelphia, has paid over to the trustees the $5,000,000 given by him for the establishment of a free industrial school for boys. It is a great gift, but Mr. Williamson has marred it and limited his own generosity by restricting its benefits to white boys and barring negroes out. It is a pity that a man so liberal ia one way should bo so narrow-spirited in another. The West is having its innings this year. Not long since the buxom maidens this side the Alleghenie3 were spoken of slightingly as "corn-fed'' by "a trifling Eastern press, but now comes the Philadelphia Record and urges jeople, even Philadelphia people, to eat corn and thereby circumvent the speculators who have put up the prices of wheat, flour and bread. Time's revenges are slow, but they do come. THE Journal hopes the Democrats will go ahead with the proposed investigation of the late election, not only in Indiana, but every where, for that matter. Let the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth be made known. We want the country to know of the forgeries, perjuries, corruption and bulldozing of the Democratic managers in Indiana. Let the world be made acquainted with the tactics of the Democratic boodlers and the outrages of Hawkins's thieves and, thugs. Turn on the light 

MODERN conveniences have their drawbacks. Last spring the Louisville City Council cre ated the office of inspector of electiic-light wires, and a practical electrician, who had been for years in the employ of the Western Union Telegraph Company, was the first ap pointee to the position. Ho began his duties on May 1, and since that time he has inspected about 120 buildings, of which he found twenty to be in danger of fire from ignition by the wires. In introducing electric lights, this matter should be carefully looked to. Wonder if it was Republican bribery and corruption that caused the enormous majori ties in most of the Northern States, the very krge Republican vote in Kentucky, exceeding Cleveland's four ye;.rs ago, and that reduced the Democratic majority in Virginia to l.oOO. If the Democrats conclude to investigate Indiana they had better investigate the other States. And while they are about it they had tetter investigate Missouri, where Gen. Harri son received 23G.323 votes against 202.2GI for Blaine four years ago; and California, where he received 124.S11 votes against 100.S1G for Blaine. The ground-swell was general. On Saturday last a party of prominent gen tlemen, representing large business and trans portation intersts, visited Atlanta and were tendered a public reception in the evening. A speech of welcome on behalf of the city was responded to by Mr. Charles S. Smith, presi dent of the New York Chamber of Commerce, who, after saying some pleasant things about the growth and prospects of Atlanta, raid: "I have been amazed to find, in my inter course with the bubines men of the South, that on questions of business, even e.xtendiog to tariff and revenue reform, partisan Kerub liesn as I am, there is a very slight difference to-day between rneu who want nothing for tkemselves but only good government for the whole country. If I might allude for a moment to an apprehension which I have found to be more or less prevalent in your State?, that the policy of the incoming administration would be likely to be less friendly than that of the present. one in the South, I want to say, gentlemen, that su?h is not the belief of the merchants of New York, and I am willing to predict that the President-elect is large enough to comprehend the issues that prevail in your section, and that you will have no oc casion to regret the result of the late elec tion.7' We should infer from this that Mr. Smith is a man of level head. THE DEMOCRATIC FEAUD EOWLEfiS The only conceivable motiya for the chorus of Democratic lying ia regard to the recent election in this State is to shield their com mittee and managers from the maledictions showered on them since the election. It is a notorious fact that for weeks before the elec tion, and even after the poll3 were closed, they gave out the most positive assurances that the Slate was Democratic by a large plurality, and advised their people to bet freely on the result. This confidence of the managers was based partly on ignorance and partly on an over estimate of the power of patronage, boodle and good schemes. On the strength of their assurances thousands of Democrats did bet a great deal more than thoy could afford to lose, many of them all they were worth. Their consternation at the result was proportioned to their previous confidence of winning. They all felt about a3 one expref sed it, "as if they had been struck on the noso by a box-car." When they got their second wind they began to curse the committees and managers for deceiving them, and they have kept it np pretty steadily since. The latter had no defense to offer, and the only shelter they could find from the storm of abuse was in the charge that the Republic ans had carried the State by bribery and cor ruption. This is supposed to save their po litical reputations, justify their advice to their victims to bet, and explain the Republican victory. The word was passed along the line, and the howl of fraud followed. It is simply another Democratic good scheme. - The asser tion that the Republicans carried the State by bribery and fraud, or that these played any considerable or appreciable part in the Repub lican victory, is an unmitigated lie, no matter from what quarter it comes, or who circulates or repeats it. The Democrats spent four dol lars to our one. In this county they spent ten dollars to our one. They got the entire floating vote of the State, and polled a heavy fraudulent vote besides. The Republicans carried the State in spite of bribery and fraud, and with a fair election they would carry it to-morrow by twice as large a plu rality as they did on Nov. C. There was no bigger or balder Democratic lie put out during the campaign than this post-election lie about Republican bribery and fraud. The Democratic pretense of de siring au investigation of the election is rot. The Republicans would welcome an investi gation. If tho Democratic fraud-howlers have any facts, or evidence, or clews indicat ing corruption, let them be brought out or laid before the proper authorities. The Re publicans would like nothing better than a searching investigation of the whole business, with acomparisoa of committee-books, cam paign expenses and election methods. Only let us have an honest investigation for the truth, and not an ox parte star chamber pro ceeding, designed to smirch Republicans and shield Democrats. The Democrats control the present House of Representatives. If the House has authority to investigate a popular election in Indiana, we invite and challenge them to do it They cannot begin too soon to suit us. MR. 

GRADY'S NIGHTMARE. The Atlantic Constitution of Nov. SO pub lishes in full what the headliner calls "Grady's Great Speech' being the speech delivered by the editor of the Constitution before a large and distinguished assemblage at Augusta. The special dispatch introducing the report of the speech says: "Great as is Mr. Grady's reputation as an orator, he won new laurels to-day. His figures were graceful and artis tically worked cut, his eloquence wa3 win ning, and his magnetic influence over his audience never greater." It is gratifying to learn from the Constitution that Mr. Grady retains his oratorical powers unimpaired, and when the list of Southern spell-binders comes to be made up we doubt not his name will lead all tho rest. Mr. Grady's Augusta speech, stripped of surplusage, was an argument in favor of maintaining tho solid South by maintaining the solidarity of the white vote in the South. Incidentally, therefore, it was an argument against negro suffrage and fair elections. From beginning to end it was based on the bugaboo of "negro domination," of which he says: "It dominates, and will dominate, all other issues with us. Political spoils are not to be considered. The administration of our affairs is secondary, and patronage is less. Economic issues are as naught, and even great coral re forms must wait on the settlement of this question. To quarrel over other issues while this is impending is to imitate the mother quail that thrums the leaves afar from her nest, or recall the finesse of the Spartan boy who smiled in his mother's face while he hid the fox that was gnawing at his vitals." Mr. Grftdy indulged in a good many fire flights as to his love for the Union, his desire for complete reconciliation, his deprecation of sectionalism, and his earnest friendship for the colored race, but it all led up to the con clusion that the white people of tho South never could, never would and never should submit to negro rule. As another specimen of his style and the oratorical fervor with which he belabored a man of straw wo quoto again: "The negro can never be established in dominion over the white race of the South. The sword of Grant and the bayonets of his army could not maintain them in tho suprem acy they had won from the helplessness of our people. No sword drawn by mortal man, no army marshalled by mortal hand, can replace them in the supremacy from which they were cast down by our people, for the Lord God Almighty decreed otherwise when ho created these races, and the flaming svnrd of His archangel will enforce hU decreeTaad work out His plan of unchangeable wisdom." It is discouraging to 6ee a man of Mr. Gra dy's intelligence, and who has been regarded as an exponent of the new South, still harping on tho bugaboo of "negro domination." He discusses the race question as if it were the mission of the Republican party to elevate black people at tho expense of white, and as if its deepest and dearest purpose were to humiliate the Southern whites by the estab lishment of what they call negro domination. Nothing is further from the truth. The Re publican party is not organized for the ad vancement of men, but of principles. It does not desire to elevate men of one race or color at the expense of another, least of all to elo vate colored people at the expense of whites. It aims to elevate all by protecting the rights and promoting the interest of all. It would like to see the experiment of republican gov ernment, universal suffrage and fair elections honestly tried in the South, with a view of ascertaining if that would not furnish the best solution of the race question. We find these the best solvent of difficult questions in the North, and see no reason why they should not be in the South. As for negro domination, it certainly is not desirable unless the negroes are fitted and qualified to exercise it; but negro domination based on fair elections would be preferable to white domination established and maintained by fraud and force. But why should there be negro domination? The : Southern whites ought not to be afraid to compete with the negroes for political supremacy c on equal terms. Is it necessary to deprive the negroes of the ballot in order to preveht negro domination? We do not believe it iiWohave a better opinion of the Southern whitjbs. We do not believe the Caucasian is played out The way to divide the colored vote and ex orcise the bugaboo of negro domination is to give them the ballot, let thorn vote, ami let their votes be counted.' The way, to keep them solid, to maintain the color line, ''atfd '.in tensify the friction of the race question, is to deny them their rights. A free ballot is the' true solution of the Southern question Under its influence the horriblo epwter of negro domination would vanish like ghosts at dawn. FRANCIS MURPHY'S WOE& With all the agitation of the temparance question that has been in progress for tho past few years practical and efficient : tem perance work has been somewhat neglected. Politics has been allowed to interfere with the conversion of the drunkard from the error of his ways; the teaching of temperance principles to the rising generation has'jiven place to party scheming that has retarded rather than advanced the desired reform. i I The process of educating the people into the wars of moralitv was found too tedious bylthe organizations formed for that purpose,' and they turned their attention to devising means for coercing the thirsty public into the straight and narrow path of abstinence, j ' One worker, a host in himself, was hqt deceived by the cry, that a tem perance millennium could be legislated into existence, and, regardless of politick, continued on the even tenor or his way Almost alone, Mr. Francis Murphy has for several years conducted the work of reform on: the old line that-of appealing to the better nature and the common sense of the victims of drink, and to the intelligence of youthful1 hearers. His refusal to join with the political workers has cost him some friends, but these have been more than replaced by the thou sands whom ho has won from evil courses.' Law may do much to restrict indulgence in i intoxicants, but law without the sentiment to support it can be of little value. In their eagerness to accomplish their aim at one stroke, the misguided third-partyites and thjeir allies have forgotten that the public nee (ied constant instruction and persuasion to bring it in line with the laws already existing, to say nothing of more stringent ones. They forgot that the people must be taughriot only their need of laws, but of the individual t? need of sobriety. Murphy has -done his part to supply this oversight : He has shown the physical and moral vdan- gers of intemperance and the beauties of clean living. He has pictured the horrors of - drunkenness and tho sufferings caused to ' the innocent He has appealed to the manli ness of his hearers, their affections, their in telligence, their hopes of a future, l3q& the result has been wonderful. Not all Vpf the i tens of thousands who have pledgeda them-f selves to abstinence at his request havejkept3 their promises, perhaps, but great nufcibersi have done so. His influence is only for good, and he is doing a great work. Wbljin Indianapolis he should bo sustained and' en couraged by all who are really interested in the progress of social and moral reform.' J1S I The Charleston News and Couriers recog- nizes business interests as a potent factor in the recent Southern elections. It says: "The election of a Republican Congressman from the Chattanooga district does not mean that Chattanooga has suddenly forgotten the South, but that many millions arO invested there in iron industries, and the people be lieved, wisely or unwisely, that President Cleveland's policy meant financial loss to them." The News and Courier appears to be doing some thinking. The Japanese Minister and his charming wife are preparing for a brilliant social season at Washington. The spaees in their long drawing-room are artistically broken up by a clever arrangement of screens. Some of there are particularly noticeable. One is covered with cloth of gold, with the design of a rocky coast, with a flight of birds over it, woven into tbe cloth. Tbe cabinets in the room are of exquisite workmanship, and the bamboo chairs are up holstered in purple tapestry, brocaded with birds and branches of trees. The minister prizes greatly a tall Satscma vase, enameled on silver, accompanied by a parchment containing the congratulations of 2,000 people, sent him when his appointment as minister to this coun try was announced.

ELAINE AND S II E UMAX. Uow the Former Tendered the Presidential Nomination to tho Latter. The North American Review for December contains a remarkable article by Gen. W. T. Sherman entitled "The Hon. James G. Blaine," in which among other things, these two remark able letters are for tfeo first time given to the public: In the year of onr Lord 18S4, there was to be a sharp contest for the nomination in Chicago for a presidential candidate of the Republican party. The press and people generally believed that Blaine wanted it. and everybody turned to him as the man best qualified to execute the policy to accomplish the result aimed at. Still, abnegat ing himself, he wrote to me from Washington this letter: "Confidential, strictly and absolutely so. 'Washington, D. C, May 25, 1834. "My Dear General This letter requires no answer. After reading it file it away in your most secret drawer or give it to tbe Banes. "At the approaching convention at Chicago it is more than possible, it is indeed not improb able, that you may be nominated for the Presi dency. If so you must stand your hand, accept the responsibility and assume the duties of the place to which you will surely be chosen if a candidate. "You must not look upon it as the work of the politicians. If it comes to you it will come as the ground swell of popular demand, and yon can no more refuse than you could have refused to obey an order when you were a lieutenant in the army. If it comes to you at all it will come as a call of patriotism. It would, in such au event, injure your great fame as much to de cline it aa it wonld for you to seek it. Your his toric record, full as it is, would be rendered still more glorious by such an administration as you would be able to give the country. Do not aay a word in advance of the convention, no mat ter who may ask you. You are with your friends who will jealously guard your honor and renown. Your friend, J .mes 0. Blaine." To which I replied: "912 Gasrison Avenue, "St. Loris. Mo., May 28. 1834.. 5 Bod. James O. Blaine, Washington: "Mv Dear Friend I have received your let ter of the 25th; aball construe it as absolutely confidential, not intimating even to any member of my family that I have beard from you, and though you tsay not expect an a&awer I nope you will not construe one as unwarranted. "I have had a great many letters from all points of the compass to a similar effect, one or two of which I have answered frankly, but the great mass are unanswered. "I ought not to submit myself to tbe cheap ridicule of declining what is not offered, but it is only fair to the many really able men who rightfully aspire to the high honor of being President of the United States to let them know that I am not and mutt not be construed as a rival. a In every man's life occurs au epoch when he mnst choose his own career and when be may not throw off the responsibility or tamely place his destiny in tbe hands of friends. Mine occurred in Louisiana, when. In 1861, alone in the midst of a people blinded by sup posed wrongs, I resolved to stand by the Union as long as a fragment of it survived on which to cling. Since then, through faction, tempest, war and peace, my career has been all my family and frienda could ask. Wo are now in a good house of our own choice, with reasonable provisions for old age, surrounded by kind ana admiring friends, in a community where Cathol icism is beld in respect and veneration, and where my children will naturally grow up in contact with an industrious and frugal people. You have known and appreciated Mrs. Sherman from childhood, have also known each nod all tbe members of my family, and can understand without ah explanation from me how their thoughts and feelings should and ought to in fluence my action. But I will not even throw off on them the responsibility. "I will not in any event entertain or acce.pt a nomination as a candidate for President by Tne Chicago Republican convention, or any other convention, for reasons personal to myself. I claim that tbe civil war, in which I simply did a man's fair share of work, so perfectly accom plished peace that military men have an abso lute right to rest, and to demand that the men who have been schooled in the arts and practice of peace shall new do their work equally well. Any Senator can sten from his chair at the Capitol into tbe White House and fulfill tbe office of President with more ekill and success than a Grant, Sherman or Sheridan, who were soldiers by education and nature, who filled well their office when the country was in danger, but were not schooled in tbe practice by which civil communities are and should be gov erned. I claim that our experience sinee 3803 demonstrates tbe truth of this my proposition. Therefore, I say that patriotism does not de mand of me what I construe as a sacrifice of judgment, of inclination and of self-interest 'I have my personal affairs in a state of abso lute safety and comfort. I owe no man a cent, b&ve no expensive habits, envy no man his wealth or power, no complications or indirect liabilities and would account myself a fool, a madman, an ass, to embark anew, at sixty-five 'years of age, in a career that may become at any moment tempest-toi "ed by perfidy, the de falcation, tbe dishonesty or neglect of any single one of a hundred thooaand-aubordinates utterly unknown to the Presiwmt of tbe United States, not to say the eternal worrl ment by a vast host of impecunious friends and old military subordinates. Even as it is I am tortured by the charitable appeals of poor, distressed pensioners, but, as President, these would be multiplied beyond human en durance. "I remervber well the experience of Generals Jackson, Harrison, Taylor", Grant. Hayes and Garfield, all elected because of their military services, and m warned, not encouraged, by their sad experiences. "The civilians of the United States should and must buffet with this thankless office, and leave us old soldiers t enjoy the peace we fougbt for and think we earnei With profound respect, Your friend, W. T. Sherman." These letters prove absolutely that Mr. Blaine, though qualified, waived to me personally a nomination which thi world still believes he then coveted for hims s'.f.

Pittsburg Dispatch. There is a certain degreo of queercess about the outcome of tbe admmuUration's treatment of tbe Northern Pacific Railroad's indemnity grants. The rather striking claims which were made by the administration, tf its work in re storing the land grants to the people, comprised as a leading feature a decision cl tbe Secretary of the Interior against that company's claim to 4.000,000 acres of indemnity .'and. After the election is over an opinion from tbe Atiorney general appears overruling the previous opin ion and sustaining the claim of tle corporation. The peculiarity of this timely rev trsal for the interest of the corporation is in tte fact that the Attorney-general's opinion is dated in last January, but by some strange oversight Per haps on account of the way in which the admin istration was engrossod in reforming I'.he tariff, it was never published until the other day. Is it pesslble that the administration's l&ud policy was only good until after election! Harrison's Policy. Philadelphia American. Mr. Harrison, having made more than n hun dred public epseches before bis electio:, de clines cow to make any more, lie can bo!& his tongue, when the time comes for that, with tre mendous force. He will cot be pumped a to the make-up of his Cabinet, his views of fhe best policy towards Canada, his purposes as to civil-service reform, or any other of the inter eting topics on which the newspapers would like to hear from him. His good friends, the interviewers, may gather from his speeches all the light thty can as regards these points. But . they may as well not watte their time in tryint to get any ittore. He is cot going to rob his inaugural of interest foi the public by dealing it out tiecmeal, through the reporters, before the 4th of March. In this be is eminently wise, and if onr news mongers were as tnxious to inform ths public as thy are to find ilomethicg "fresh and "spe cial," they could geu answers to most of their deep problems in Mr. Harrison's speeches 'atic" letters. Why do thoy not ransack and tabulate these, so as to show exactly where the President-elect stands! Yrby perpetrate the absurd ity of asking whether he means to enforce tbe civil-service reform law, when his Senate speech on Mr. Cleveland's administration of that law, the platform adopted rit Chicago, and his letter of acceptance, pet the matter in tbo clearest light? It is nothing better tban impertinence to ask him to thresh all that straw over again, when he has cot time for much more important matters. r GEN. 

HARRISON SINCE ELECTION. Ills Course Increases Confidence In Ills Wis dom and Prudence Philadelphia Trebs. , Gen. Harrison since the election has deepened the impression hi- made en tbe country dnricg the campaign. N candidate in the long nistory of our presidential elections has spoken cftener, more freely or more f ally during his canvaf s. For weeks he was daily before tbe people with a speech, which was tbe next morning before the 4,000,000 voters within reach of the daily press of tbe country. Every spetch helped him, and tbe cause for which he was a standard-bearer. Not one contained a word or a sentence which was used to his injury. Neither the malice of his enemies nor the ingenuity of partisan op ponents could find text or pretext for attack in these speeches, whose collected bulk would fill a volume. If ever a presidential candidate made his own calling and election sure by his own ef forts. Gen. Harrison did it in these spe?cbes, which began with his nomination and ended a fortnight before his triumphant election. But if General Harr son showed he could talk before election, he has shown he could hold bis tongue since then. Visited by hundreds, sought by scores, closeted with conspicuous men by the dozen, a center of the pleas, the pressure and the pertinacious petitions which beat about a President-elect, General Harrison has made no mistakes. He has grown daily before tbe country. His reticence, poise and prudence have impressed alL He has blundered into none of tbe sentiment which marred the first post-election month of some of bis recent predecessors. He has madf no pledges. He has avoided political en tanglements. We hear nothing of any Indianapolis "conference." The Cabinet-mnk-ers are at sea. Tbe gossip venders bring noth-.nr away from the modest home in which the next President has spent so many hard-working years. General Harrison is keeping his own counsel making bis own plans, giving no one a rtgbt ti speak for his policy nntil he lays it down him self, and acting as bis own Cabinet-maker. The Republican party and the country see all this with profound satisfaction. It breeds confidence in tbe President and bis administration. It stills apprehension at the South and elsewhere. It creates the conviction that pnblio interest! havo in General Harrison a man silent, resniuti snd decided, who acts for kimtelf, but waits is his action until all ia heard that can be said on the issue before him. The work of a President ia hard. The open ings for error are legion. A President has cone of the aid a secretary gets from tbe permanent staff of a department. The Wbite Honee has no "permanent under-seeret&ry. Each new incumbent begins tbe work anew. The preparation for the offiee is sown thick with pitfalls. More than one administration has been wrecked by tbe work done before its chief was inaugurated. For four months before be assumes office a President-elect bears many of the burdens of office and enjoy, none of iti vantage ground and opportunity. In each period, discretion, demeanor and decision art everythinr. and General Harriionh&s shown all these. They hav rallied to him the backioe ot the country as a whole. With all tbe bitterness of party strife tbere is not a country in thi worid in which the great mats of citizens ar more ready to support in a sound public policy a public officer whose election they have op posed. General Uarrison has only to go on ar he has begun during tbe first month sioce his election to rally to his support tbe sound, con servative sentiment of the land, irrespective of party. 

DEMOCRATIC BRIBERY CHARGES. The Absurdity of the Assertion that the Elec tion Was Carried by Bribery. Philadelphia Press. The Democratic papers are trying to find some consolation for their recent defeat by charging it to the lavish use of money on the part ot the Republicans. Of course none of them believe what they are themselves saying, but they nop. t create a popular suspicion which will be ot use to them in future elections. They know that big black type in tbe headlines of a news papers and a mouthful of figures from a man who wants to be considered prominent in pol itics will go further with the majority of the Democratic party tban sworn evidence in a court. So ex-Senator MoDcnald is called in as a witness, and he places the sum that the Repub licans dumped into Indiana at 51.000.0C0; Texes Mills "sees" McDonald and "goes" him $ 300.000 better, and doubtless when Chairman Brice comes to be interviewed be whl "raise" the "pet" to $2. 000. CC0. Without stopping to show these newspapers what an insult they are flinging into tbe face of tbe American people we would like to ask them to catch their breath while tbe absurdity of their eharges is pointed out. It the Republicans carried the election by bribery, how does it happen that they lost in the large cities, where the purchasable vote resides, and gained among the honest, sturdy population of the rural coun ties? And how was it that the Democrats gained largely in New York city. Troy, Albany and places where a corruption fund is always potent, and lost in every county where elec tions are conducted free from money? The Re publican losses and gains in Indiana were made in just the same localities aa in New York. If there was Republican bribery in Indiana in order to carry it for Iiarrisou, how was it that the Republican plurality on Congressmen in that State was double what it was on presi dential electors? Two years ago General Harrison was a candi date before tbe people of Indiana for re-election to the Senate and his plurality on the vote for members of the Legislature was 9.E80. Was that the result of bribery? At the same elec tion the Republican State ticket bad a plurality o! 3,324, but by force and fraud the Democrats refused to give the Republican Lieutenant-governor his rights, and through an infamous ger rymander tbey defeated Harrison's re-election. Isn't it tbe height of impudence for tbe organs ot a party which is a colossal combination against tbe purity of tbe ballot to shriek boodle" in big type? "Sim" Coy, the con victed Democratio tally-sheet forger, must laugh in his eleeves as he sits in Michigan City, Ind., prison, at this new-found virtue of his party, and "Joe"Mackir, of Joliet, 111., prison, must fear that his party has experienced a change ot heart since La stuffed ballot-boxes for it. Fraud and forgery on tbe part ot the Demo crats can never excuse bribery on tbe t art cf the Republicans. Tbe latter ask for no triutith but a clean one, and tbey always make their ap peal to tbe intelligence, and not to the sordid motives of tbe voters. The Democracy was beaten in a square stand-up fight, and notwith standing the facts that it bad the cards stocked in tbe South, and it was led by notorious cor ruptionists. and that its national committee was purposely made up of railroad boodlers." Under these circumstances it is only making itself ridiculous now by shrieking fraud and bribery. aa --MB-awa m-mw- Grandfather's Hat. Kew York IIeralL Most of tbe talk about "grandfather's hat" is pure nonsense. It was not so frightfully big after all, and if Mr. Harrison' head contains alt the plans for the welfare of the people it is cred ited with he will never be able to pail tae old gentleman's tile down to his eyebrowj without bursting the haibacd. A Good Idea. Philadelphia Treta. Pumpkins and apples and wild animals con tinue to flow in upon General Harrison at In dianapolis. Some of these people ought to send their curiosities to President Cleveland. He will soon have time to amuse himself with them. Why It Hurts Thtm. PltWturg Dispatch. The real complaint of the secedera from the G. A. R. in Indiana and Illinois is cot that it was used an a political machine against them; but that it could cot be used as a political machine In their favor. One Tollcy for the Whole Country. Buffalo Express. President Harrison's Southern policy is a pretty good one. In other words, he has no Southern policy, but will treat the country as a whole, and treat it fairly. A Hani Task. ' Chicago Blail. The Cabinet makers find their task, this time, a most unsatisfactory one. President elect Harrison's taste in woods is as unknown aa tbe i flavor of a roc's egg-
