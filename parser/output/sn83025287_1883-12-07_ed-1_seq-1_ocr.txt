Wheat wa3 active and rather * ■ settled being weak and * <v^r eiri',', recovering some again fell at. it the. olose Jannary was about lclowei than at 1 o'clock yesterday and May lj^e lower. Atthe opening the market wa dec.dso'ly lower than yester day, but with .ii. t-iciciMJ corn market prices quickly t'.'V-'ciajjJ >^4?}l-J then be- I came heavy whon :i-o viiib'a supply was posted shoving an increase of nearly one million and fell %c, then advanced irregularly, corn ngain going on the rainpas;o, 1. it near the close became slump/ and fell 1%0 from the highest point, closing weak on call. The demand was quite active and offerings moderately large. Sales were principally in January. Corn actively a^nic characterized the market, but trading centered chiefly in May delivery in whicli fntnre a very large business was transacted. The market was considerably excited. Unusually large amounts were offered wheu the market reached the highest rices, p.*ill the market was pretty well sustain. J. for time being, and even sold beyond that price. Shorts were auxions to cover influenced in tbeir action by the rep of rainy weather in the west. The visible supply also showed a reduction of about 260,000. The reoeipts were larger and the shipments rather small. Prices were advanced %a for the near deliveries and l@l for May above opening figures, but later icached%@,\%Q and finally closed about [go lower for the neat futures, also 'l'e lower for May than closing figures on 'change yesterday. On coll the demand was fairly active, and prices firmer, and %@ higher. Trading was principally iv the May option. Iv the market for oats as compared with yesterday'a closing or outside quotations, prices ranged about *?a@Kc higher. The' advance was dne to the influenc exerted by a higher market for corn, and the faot that at the pre/eat ktio of trade sellers are | not coming for waul very freely. Tho spec ulative demand was fair, but the market conld not be called active, and the full ad vance was not maintained. All trading on the regular market waa in a speculative way. The sample trade, or rather the shipping or co&KUinprivtt trade was just moderate aLd prices were quotably steady. ' On call, the market was rather quiet, and prices a trifle higher. ' Trading was confinod to tho May delivery. In ije, the maiket reacted from the de cline of yesterday mi.'l ruled firm. Quite a little future rise has been closed out by longs during the Just few days, and to-day the speculative offerings weie smaller and tho advance in other markets affected a better feeling. There was also more demand on a speculative nature. Ar- rivals only moderate. Demand mainly speculative. On call rye was in fair re quest and prices steady. Sales were prin cipally in January. In barley trade was dull and there was more barley on the market than there was demand for. No. 2 held tolerably steady on account of some little speculation ia that grade. In store prices were not changed ma terially any way for there is little in htore. Most of the barley is of fered by simple because sometimes bar ley will just miss a high grade in the in spection en acconnt of some li' tie blemish and by sample it sol's lor more than the in store price, of the same grade. The sup ply of sample lots largely exceeded the demand. Consignments have been ac cumulating for several days and the ordi nary qualities will probably have to go to store move, than at any previous time thia season.' Flour continues quiet and it has been difficult for some time to bring about fair sales with the home trade pick ing up about the usual quantity of the bet ter family and bakers' brands, but ship ping orders are light and it has been necessary to allow shaded prioes to dis pose of any quantity. Rye flour slow. Buckwheat flour dull. Bran and all millstaffs were bringing firm prices. In provisions a good business was reported but the feel ing wa". very unsettled, and prices fluctuated. The receipts of ho?s were qnite liberal and prices were well maintained on de- sirable grades, .'.nd this tended to strengh- en the market early in the session, more particularly as the local and outside orders to purchase product were sufficiently large to create considerable competition for the speculative articles, and thereby cansiug a material advance in prices. Toward the close the market again showed consider able strength but weakened again and closed dull. Foreign advices showed a firmer feeling Foreign advices shoved a firmer feeling in lard and quotations advanced Gd. but pork and bacon was dnll at former prices. Eastern markets wero stronger in a gen- eral way and prices rather favorable to sellers. Weather is mild. The market fo.. mess pork attracted marked attention and the volume of busi- ness transacted was liberal. At the open- ing the market was easy and prices 10@ lf>o lower, but under the influence of an urgent demand gradually improved 15 @20c. Later prices receded 7"^@10o, but soon rallied again, near the close receded 10@ 15c and closed, tame. The shipping demand was moderate. On call the de- mand was quite active and offerings rather free. Prices ruled 2"2@.r>c higher. Trad- ing in February. Qaite a good demand prevailed for lard and the offerings were large. The bidding was quite strong dur- ing the greater portion of the day and prices advanced 10 20c per 100 pounds, but the appreciation was not sustained. The shipping demand was fairly active. On call was in fair request and prices were steady. Sales were moderate and princi- pally in February, Wfffift.i- 9;i,B*sy The demand for . short ribs was mod- erately active and the offerings were fair. The market ruled firmer and prices were advanced s@loo per 100 pounds and closed steady. The demand on shipping account was light. On call there was a good de- mand and prices 2j£@sc higher. Sales were in Jannary and February. NEW YORK. [Special Telegram to the Globe.] New Yobk, Dec. 6. —The sharp decline in Northern Pacific this morning unsettled the market for a time and made the day a dull one. There was little change in values of the better class of stocks and in some instances an advance was I made. Manitoba after opening below par touched 101%, and this in face of a falling off in earnings of $25,000 for the fourth week of November. Lako Shore was in request at about 100, and St. Paul was again in demand. A break in Oregcn Transcontinental after, midday to -12 was another disturbing element. Oregon rail- way sold at 109 at about the same time. The Villards seem to be having a hard time of it. Reading cot loose from its I surroundings and advanced to 55j^. The closing price last evening was 53*4. Central & Hudson announced a reduction in com- mutation rates on the Hudson ri/er & Har lem division, of from 40 to 50 per cent. The closing on Northwestern are ex-divi dend 3% per cent, and on the preferred 2 per cent. It was freely reported that Van- derbilt had been unloading Northwestern. If this is the caso some one has been very kind in taking the load off his hands at a very small decline. Missouri Pacifio books close December 2Gth,divideud 1% per cent. The street is still unwilling to believo in the tripartite alliance of the Union Pacific, St. Paul and Flock Island, and officers of the Union Pacifio are quo- ted as denying the whole story yet many still believe that such an alliance has been effected.but that it is not for the interest of certain prominent insiders to have it known just yet. Manitoba's earnings during the fourth week of November de- creased $52,000, while Omaha's earnings for the same time increased $27,000, and during the month increased §55,000. Missouri Pacific has declared the usual 1% per cent, dividend. Most of the largest operators were at the Windsor last evening, including Vander- bilt, Gould, D. O. Miils, Smith,Woerjshofrer and Commack. It was reported the Perm- sylvania Central had withdrawn from tie coke pool, which is a portion of tho trunk line's association, and it was npon this news that Commack sold 10,000 shares of Lake Shore yesterday afternoon. Fink I paid last evenirg that whether i this pool was to ie maintained [ r.nd continued or broken np will be de- cided to-day, and from tins it would seem ; that the announced withdrawal of the Pennsylvania Central was a. little prema ture. The leading bears declare that the dissolution of this coke combination goes to the whole Chicago & New York Trunk line pool. The coke ba-iness amounts to j several millions dollars per annum and the I trouble has come ftom the Ne*? York Cen tral extensions in the Pennsylvania regions. Vanderbilt and Dapew eneh re marked last evening that there was no more truth in the reported breaking up of the trunk line pool than there was in the rumor that the New York Central Railroad company had decided to issue $20,000,000 of bonds. Vanderbilt said he was doing nothing in the market and it was not true that he had pegged New York Central for Lake Shore, but tr.at he had observed that all the stocks which were pressed upon the market for sale were bought by somebody. Ho added that tie New York Central had decided to lower commutation rates 50 per cent, from January 1. It. is repott- ed on excellent authority that Vanderbilt has had his experts and accountants thor oughly examine the Philadelphi ■. & Read- ing account for. past, year in ste if it has actually ear ■'. a dividend, and it ha^ been determined upon the pr v.^u showing to pay three per cent, on ihe stock. Van- rlerbilt people bonght 10.000 shares of Reading yesterday upon this information. The Delaware, Lackawanna & Western company yesterday decided to reduce all size of Scranton coal and it is expected Hi other com- panics will follow suit. The various mm ing companies have agreed to suspend work for ten days this month. The Louis- ville " & Nashville railroad people together with the other southern lines be- longing to the same pool have agreed to arbitrate all matters regarding rates, etc., January 15. A private London dispatch received at the Windsor last evening pays the Grand Trunk lease of tho West Shore had been signed. The feeling is bullish on Pacifio Mail and it is said Hart bought 3,000 shares, and says the stock is going to 50. "The story that was circulated yesterday to the effect that I was abont to suspend is a blankety blanked lie," thnudered Jim Keene to-day. Mr. Keene was very wrathy and said he meant to sno the paper in which it was published for libel. CAPITAL SOCIETY. Mrs. Sheridan's Taesday Keceptions-The Gay Season a Month Early.

WASHINGTON.! 0 » ————— IMPORTANT BILLS PRESENTED TO IMPORTANT BILLS PRESENTED TO THE SENATE TO- DA T. *' The Hease of Representatives has a Virr Short Sitting:—The Parties Preparing for the Tag of War— Caucuses Being Held Hourly—Many Important Gatherings In the City. DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. Washington, Dec. 6. —The Democratic senators held a caucus this morning, Mr. Pendleton presiding, to arrange the party membership of the committees. Some feeling was displayed in respect to the habit of the older members securing the majority of important places on the com- mittees, to the exclusion of the younger members. The following committee was appointed to arrange the minority mem- bership in the best interests of all, and to report its action at the next caucus: Messrs. Harris, Cockrill, Garland, Butler, George Morgan and Call. An old member of the house said this morning that the new men were seeking positions on the; ways and means, ap propriation and judiciary committees — in fact, they wanted to be cennected with all important committees. It is generally conceded by the Democratic members that Morrison will be given the chairman- ship of the ways and means, and as asso ciates on the ways and means are men tioned the names of Hewitt, Randolph, Tucker, Cortin, Geddes, Herbert, Sey mour, Maybnry, Cox or Hard, Democrats, and Kelly, Easson and Haskell, Republi- cans. The Democratic members do not unanimously favor Morrison's election to the waya and means cl airman- ship, on the ground of the opposition being, as expressed by the protectionists, that his appointment so closely following that of Carslile's election to the speaker- ship would precipitate the tariff issue in 1884. And he added, gentlemen, it is not the province of the speaker, nor, for that matter, of congress either to favor any political issues upon the country. Speak- er Carlisle has advice at the rate of 300 letters a day but i 3 diligently keeping his own counsel in respect to his purposes. The executive order for consolidating the internal revenue districts is revoked as applied to Wisconsin, the districts in that stale remain unchanged. MISCELLANEOUS WASHINGTON. A large delegation of ladies and gentle- tlemen from the American Humane asso ciation now in session here, called at the White house to-day anu paid their respects to the president. The secretary of the interior has re jt cted the application of tho mayor and city council of LeadvjJle, who have entered cer- tain lands for town site purposes, on the ground that the greater portion of it was already patented for placer claims or re- served for hospital and cemetery purposes. Such portion of lands, however, not already disposed of and can be seggrerjated, may be held subject to entry by the city. To remedy in some measure what is regarded by many as a grave injustice is the present representation at thei Republi- can national convention, which givea states and district all over the couutry the same vote.-., regardless of the Republican votes, when in some districts of the south even the form of negotiating for a Re- publican candidate for congress is not pur- sued. Senator Frye, member of the "Re- publican national committee, will propose at the next meeting of the committee on December 12, a new basis of representa tion, as follows: Each state will be en- titled to four delegates as now; eaoh dis trict to one instead of two as now, and to one additional delegate for eaoh 10,000 votes cast within its limits in 1880 for Re- publican candidates at the presidential elections, and to one additional delegate for a majority fraction over a 10,000 vote. The vote for the presidential electors thus taken will be the oest as indicating the real strength of the party in any district. This divirsion would be less liable to be affected by local causes. The effect of this proposition, if adopted, upon the states and the convention is shown by the annexed table compiled by application,of the presidential vote of 1880 to tho dis tricts as then existing. The application of the same rule tothe present districts un- der the late apportionment oonld not jusc vow be readily made, owing to the lack of the necessary atid accurate information, out it vill not materially change the rela tive strength of the several states, and will only increase the total membership of the convention by about eighty: _ _ _ a ra © r ?. s '"■ £• ° C* £• en* "-* : S « : " = :2= £» : : states. ; -k < • ■ :*» <* : : r goo " • ill:: '■ •?

SUIT. The State of Texas to Bring a Snit Against The United States Government to Make Pay for the Loss of Their Slave Property. - St. Louis. Dec/6, —Further facts regard ing the suit to be broughtbef ore the court of claims in Washington for the recovery of the value of slaves in Texas are as fol lows:. It is alleged that Texas was admit ted to the Union under peculiar and dif ferent circumstances from any of the other states, and this action will be brought in good faith, on the advice of some of the best lawyers in Texas : and without any idea of creating political k ex citement. The negotiations for the annex ation of Texas began during Tyler's administration and the joint resolutions providing for its annexation by the presi dent on Maroh 1, 1845./ These resolutions contained conditions and guarantees the moat significant of which,. in rtga'd to the present case, is as follows: Section 3. New states of convenient size, not exceeding four in number, in ad dition to the said state of Texas, and hav ing a sufficient population, may hereafter, by consent of said state be formed out of the territory there of, which shall be entitled to admission under the provisions of the federal consti tution, and such states as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes of north latitude, commonly known as the Missouri compromise line, shall be admitted into the union with or with out slavery as the people of eaoh state asking admission may desire. The Texans took advantage of this and in framing their stats constitution under which they would be willing to come into the union, they stretched the slavery guar antee to the limits which the lawyers of the present day think makes the United States government responsible for the loss of slave property. At the next congress of the United States this constitution was submitted and provoked a long and bitter struggle, and it is noted that the clauses in it upon which this litigation will be based, were then pointed out as not only objectionable but dangerous, and virtually making congress guarantee slave property. The constitution was finally accepted, however, and the joint resolutions adopted, admitting Texas into the union. 

SALT LAKE OPINION. Arthur off Color with the Saints. | Special Telegram to the Globe. J Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec, The News, a Mormon organ, in its leader says; The presidents message will be hailed by the hireling olergy with pleasure and re ceive any amount of popular support. It is not shown in what way the destruction of our local government would affect the question of polygamy. Plural marriages of Mormons not recognized by territorial laws cauld not be dissolved by commis sion, by edies, by armies or by any other earthly power. They are ecclesiastical and are perpetual and eternal until the Mormons become recreant to their faith with high heaven. Those unions will be recognized by the Almighty Being who establishee them for the benefit of his peoples and the fulness of .his glory The president's remarks on Utah polyga my do not add to the force of his message, nor the credit of his statesmanship. They are a sop to bigots and a breath to the flame of popular passion. It is doubtful if they will have a practical bearing on congress, they certainly will create no com motion among the God-fearing people in Utah. THE
