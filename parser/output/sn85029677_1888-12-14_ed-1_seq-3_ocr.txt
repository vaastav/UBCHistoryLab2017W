LEPKUSY IN CANADA. C&lne'e Broutl-t tha Seeds of the Dread ful Scourge and tUe Dominion Jov erument Criminally Creljs lu Permitting It to Spread. The II nnjry Are After a Chance at the 1'uMlo Crib In Great Numbers A X'cmr Tear's 't Has Made Ihfin Deliberate. Ottawa, Oxt., November 2S. There no ionger remains any doubt that the peels of that dreadful scourge, leprosy, which has been so much feared in B.itish Columbia, tas, through wantou carclea?nest, amount, iajr to criminal neglect, been eown to an ex lent that the efforts of a generation will not eradicate it. Senator Mclnnes, M. D., from British Columbia, states that out of the total Indian population of tne province, which ho placed at 40.0CO, he believes that there will not be 5,000 living in a quarter of a century as n result of tho leprosy. The Columbia authorities hive for sereral years been offi cially informed of the presence of the Chi nesa lepers, but took little or no action against them, fearing that the agitation of the subject would turn away the tide of im migration coming from Europe. Fortunately, in the eastern 'part of the Dominion, in the neighborhood of Traca- dio, N. B., where leprosy has existed many years, the disease, owing to the careful and etringent measures which have been taken to secure its isolation, is being rapidly ex terminated, and thoe in charge of the Tra cadie lazaret to have great hopes that within the next live j ears the last cae will have disappeared. Last year one of tho patients aff ected managed to escape from the insti tution to the United States, where all traco of him was lost. The last reoort of the oili cer in charge showed that the number of patients ooniinoc in the living tomb at Tra tadie was 17 against in lss-i. The Clermiu Ihrona. London, December 1. Tho ffports of tho confinement of the emperor of Germany to his apartments with a severe cold have re vived the stories prevalent here some time ao of the young monarch's scrofulous con dition and the imminence of his eucumbing to u disease similar to that whijh terminat ed the life of his father. From private dis patches received during the last few days as well as correspondence giving what pur ported to ba r.ccurate information as to the nctual condition of the health of Eruperor YViiiiam, covering the last fortnight, it is gathered that tho German throna is threat ened with another abdication through the operation of tho laws of nature within the next year, und it is asserted that the abso lute tact cannot bo machmuoii longer with held from tho public. Almost immediately upon his accession to to the throne Emperor William, never re garded as a robust man, although appear ing in padJe.t uniform as of fine phisique and in excelent form, began a series of visits to Ms imperial and royal brethren, the ex actions of which would have impaired the powers of a much stronger man than he. Moreover it is state d that upon several oc casions covered by the period of his jour neys aud etopage at the various capitals visited, the young emperor permitted himself to indulge inordinately in strong drink a practice to which ho was not ad dicted prior to his assumption of imperial power. To this indulgence and its conse quent effects are ascribed many of his lapses iu filial duty toward his mother, which in the fii lir.flfir H'oM-j f .

I en luuuu ui miemperanc 3 or speech with reference to vit.il political questions. That tha emperor's constitutional ail ments have been very mnci aggravated by over exertion and overindulgence there can be no doubt, and the sntgestion that he is now upon the verge cf muttering from a complaint from which few of the ilolsenzol lerns of the liter generation have been en tirely free is received in England with an 'JL told you so" air betokening, if not gen uine satisfaction, at least an unshaken be lief in the doctrine of retributive justice. The Advance Guard. Washington, D. C, November 30. The advance guard of the office seekers has ap peared in Vashington. It is composed of republicans who went out of office four years ago, the men who had been in the government service for many years. They expect to be restored to the places they were forced to vaoate, or to be appointed to other positions equally responsible and remunera tive. They do not hesitate to say what they want, for they look upon themselves as martyrs in the republican cause. They look upon their dismissal by the democrats as srlf-eacrifica on their own part, and for this they intimate the republican party owes them a debt of gratitude. The inference is that the obligation can be discharged by the administration, the proper method be ing to reward them with oilioe. Many of these aspirants have lived here through the four years of democratic reign, waiting for a return of republican power. They are consequently on the ground early and they will ask for what they want. llepnbiican congressmen who are here state freely that the newer element of the party will be rt-cognized, although the old will not be neglected. But the professionals, and those who were designated as 4-barna-les" four years ago, will not be remember ed in the substantial manner they seem to xpect. A conflict is impending between the old and the new, and it promises to be interesting. President Harrison's civil ser vice sentiment, as reflected by his home organ, are not acojpted here as especially comforting to the early office seekers, and there are already signs of discouragement among them, ho doubt exists that the ad ministration will remove the democrats from oflios, bat the inference i generally drawn here that their places will be tilled with tha newer element of the republican party. It all road Magnates. Chicago. November L'J. Regarding the much talked of conference between Chair man Midgeley and several railroad mag nates in New York a local paper saya: "For several weeis past Jay Gould, C. P. Hunt ington, Charles Francis Adams, YV. B. Strong and other railroad magnates inter ested in western railroads have been hold ing conferences in New York in which Chairman Midgeley, of the Southwestern Kailway association, has taken a prominent part. The object of the conferences has been kept a profound secret. The announce ment was made that the conferences had come to an end and that an agreement had been made whereby the troubles among the Southwestern roatls would be ended, and rates be advanced from "5 to ii3 per cent as coon as possible. Bat thi announcement was no nearer the truth than previous re ports regarding the mysterious conference. All the existing freight and passenger a-sc-ciat.OQ3 within the territory west of the great lakes are to be abolished end merged into the trust, or "clearing house," as it is named. There will be an exeoutive board of three which hall devote its entire atten tion to the affairs of the "e'earing house" and ail matters connected tuefewith. One cf the two is to be elected chairman of the 'clearing house" and the ether to be known as vies chairman and commissioner. Three propositions, it is understood, were pre sented at the New York conference. Ote providing for a division of traliie, another for a division of earnings and a third fcr a clear:;, 2 house. It was finally decided t accept the latter because the former were more likely to bring the roaJs into contiiefc with tho interstate commerce law. Republicans Have the House. Washington, D. C, November 20. Tb.3 dispatches received from West Virginia North Carolina and Tennessee make it ab solntely certain that the republicans have the house in the Fifty-first congress. Count ing only decisions that have been actually reached, the house stands, republicans ICG, democrat', 150. This is a republican ma jority of seven. It counts the Symoas dis trict in North Carolina acd the Atkinson district in West Virginia to tha dc-mourats, but both are still ciaimel by the republi cans, and both may yet be awarded them in the linal decision. Tne republicans have now the following southern districts which have been in doubt: Coleman, in .Louisiana; Evans, in Tennessep; Slockbridge, iu Mary laud, and the two West Virginia districts conceded by democrats there. ISuf po-ing the two West Virginia districts, as well as Atkinson, are given to the democrats, tha house would still remain republican by three majority, and as these are the only cases where a formal decision has not been reached, the republicans cannot in any event lose the house. If 3ymon3 cf North Carolina, aud Atkin son in Virginia, receive certificates, which ii possible, the republican majority will go to eleven. If one of them obtains a certifi cate the majority will be nine. The senate, with the gain in Deleware, will stand after the 4th of March, thirty-nice republicans to thirty-seven democrats, with the vote of th' vice-president to spare. Sebastian Promoted. Chicago, November 30. John Sebastian, general passenger egent of the Chicago, Kansas fc Nebraska division of the Itock Is land, it is understood, is to be appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of K. A. Holbrook.and that he will have charge of the passenger department, not only of the Jiock Island proper, but of the entire system, including the lined west of the Mis souri rivfr. Ifclt Lais ban pretty generally understood in railroad circles that Mr. Sebastian would in time become general ticket and passenger rgent of the entire Rock Island system, hence the news conveyed in the dispatch from Chicago will occasion no surprise among railroad men. It is scarcely neces sary to say that a better appointment could not be made and Mr. Sebastian's friends, who are numbered by the hundreds, will earnestly hope that the report is well found ed. He i3 certainly well qualified to fill the position, and the promotion will boajusr tribute to his unquestioned ability. The Territories. Washington, D. C. December 1. Con gressman Springer, chairman of the house committee on territories, La3 arrived here. "We are going to try very hard to pass the bill admitting the territories of vash iugton, Montana, Dakota and New Mex ico," said he to-day, "and we shall certainly pass the Oklahoma bill. The next house will undoubtedly be republican by a email majority, and I suppose the republicans of both house and senate would have no objec tion to strengthening that majority. The admission of territories would do that since they could be states in time to elect senators and representatives to the fifty-first con gress. Montana, Washington oni Dakota are republican. The senate must insist on a division of Dakota and such action would probably block matters for awhile, but I ata in favor of any reasonable compromise." Southern Indutrlal Interest, Baltimokh, Md., December 1. The special reports to the Manufacturers' Re cord of the activity iu the industrial interests of the south will show this w eek has been a very busy one. Among the new enterprises is a &5,COO,000 company composed of Now England capitalists, organized at Fort Fayne, Ala., to develop mineral land, build furnaces, a rolling mill, etc.; at Knoxville, a $500,01)0 slate quarrying company and a .JoOO.CUO improvement company to build street railroads, etc; Ocal, Fla., a ..0O,0OD general improvement company; Baltimore.a 500,000 agricultural implement company; El Faso, a $50,000 irigation company; a f 500,U00 company will build a manufactur ing town near Asheville, N. C. ; cotton mill 3 are projected at Gatfney City and Wium boro, S. C, and at Cedartown, Ga., a $100,' COO spindle mill will be built at once. Genie in the Territory. Paesons, Kan., December 1. Several parties have gone to the Indian territory on hunting expeditions with full outfits of camping furniture. Game of all kinds is more abundant in the Indian territory this year than has ever before been known and, singularly, there is none in the timber lands of the Mississippi bottoms in Arkansas, which usually swarm with game at this time of year. Old hunters say that the Hoods of the past two or three years have caused the game to seek other locations aud the greater part has found its way to the Indian territory. Deer is, therefore, very numerous among the hills of the country east of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas rail road, while rabbits, quail, etc., are no thick that any body who can shoot a gun can get all they can carry away. A Wreck Near Raldwin. " Lawei:nck, Kan., Novenber CO The BOdhbouad passengsr train on the branch of the Southern Kansas was wrecked on Wednesday near Baldwin. The train was just passing over a small bridge when a rail broke and the mail car and two passenger coaches went through, the locomotive re maining on the track. Mr. R. W. Sparr of this city received quite serious injuries and also George Perry, a University student who was on his way to his home in Parsons to spend Thanksgiving. All the passengers received more or le33 painful bruises. They were taken to Ottawa in a freight car. , To Attend the Inaugural. St. Joseph, Mo., November 30. The Lin coln club of St. Joseph, is making arrange ments to attend President Harrison's inaug ural in royal style. The committee is now figuring with the Diagonal people for a special train of ten Pudman cars via the Diagonal to Chicago and then over the Bal timore fc Ohio railway to the national capi tal. A Bull Terrier and a Coon. Cleveland, O., December 1. Twenty-five sportsmen witnessed a fight between a bull terrier and a raccoon from Gallon, O. The animal weighed twenty-four pounds. The match was for $25 a sida the dog to kill the coon in tweaty minutes. The coon turned upon its back, using its teeth upon the dog's head and neck, and in sixteen minutes the dog's owners gave up the fight. - Oklahoma Colony. St. Louis, December 1. A special from Oklahoma, I. T.f saya the Battlers held a meeting at that place and organized a col ony for tne protection of their rights, and to let the outside world know how they are prospering. They petitioned the president to let them make a settlement, for the re moval of the vast herds which are held here illegally and showed up the frauds whioi. existed. Taken to St. Louis. New Yoex, Deoember 1. Tha remains of Mrs. W. T. Sherman, accompanied by her family and Senator John Sherman, have been taken to ist. Louis. There were no reli-'ious services in this city. Thirteen carriages with mourners aooompanie-t thi hearae to tha railroad depot. 

INTERSTATE COMIlEECE. A Keoord of Railroad itxtennlona The Number of Railroad Corporations Much Greater Thau the Number of Operat ing Coiapanlc-a, Lease, the Reason. Combinations for the Protection of Basl oew of the Roads and Their Pat rot a Allowable, but Great Trusts" Condemned. Washington, D. C, December 3. The following is a summary of the annual re port of the interstate commerce commis sion: From the best information now available the railroad mileage of the country on the 3Glh day of June, lbSS, is estimated at 2, 7S1, of which 2,312 miles had been complet ed and brought into operation withia the six months preceding that day. The number of corporations represented is 1.251, but, by reason of leases or other contract arrangements, many corporations hold, control and operate one or more roads owned by other corporations, and the whole number making reports or operated at the time named was C05. The commission deplores the rate wars, and thinks that these evils are magnified by the custom of allowing subordinates to make rates. On the subject of pooling and trusts, the report says: It is reasonable to expect that carriers of the country will, where practicable, make such joint arrangements, so that the public shall find an arrangement with one ade quate for the purposes of any single transac tion. There Ehould be some means of en forcing among carriers the obligations, moral or legl, that would grow out of such arrangements. The only effectual means by which good faith cauld be enforced was the pooling of freight or earnings, but pool ing is now out of tueir power, being forbid den by law. The tendency among railroads seems likely io be In the direction of con solidation as the only means of mutual pro tection against rate wars. Bat anything equivalent to the creation cf what is now, technically denominated as trust, could hardly be supposed possible, even if tho parties were at liberty to form it at pleas ure. If the parties could come into harmony on tho subject, an arrangement of the sort would be so powerful in its control over the business interests of the country, and so susceptible to uses for misthovious pur poses, that puHio policy could not for a moment sanction it, at least, unie3 by statute it were held in close legal restraints and under public control. Like arrangc-menta in other lin?s of business are already aulHciiiitly threatening to the pub lia interest aud the most ardent au"v33;ue of the concentration of railroad authority can hardly expect that it will control the trans portation of the country. Tacking con centration of aathorit, railroads can do much towards better relations with the pub lic and the establishment of better relations among themselves. The need of this is very imperative. In all the cutting of rates the party beginning it makes insinuations against its competitors. Carriers cuttins rates have proclaimed that the roducLd rates were all that could be justly demanded when persons having experience knew that persistence in such rates would lead directly to bankruptcy. An impartial observer is compelled to say that 6uch methods do not belong to the present age. To make the adversary feel and fear the power to inflict injury is often the first and principal thought and a rato is cut, when in a ruder age it would have been a throat. The motive is to obtain a right or extort a privilege, or puniU a wroug and irrespective of any qcestioi whether there are not legal reme dies which are ad:qunto for all purposes of substantial justice. While this cemmiseion is not at this time prepared i3 reaommand general legislation towards the establish ment and promotion of relation between the earners that shall better subserve the public interest than those which are now common, but mcst nevertheless look for ward to the possibility of something of that nature becoming impeiative unless a great improvement in the existing conditions is voluntarily inaugurated. The Senate Tariff Rill. Washington, D. C, December 3. There seems to be an agreement among the re publican leaders that the senate tariff bill will be taken np the first thingthis winter and pushed through to its passage in the senate. Mr. McKinley 6ays so, and Senators Allison and Spooner make the same declar ation. The bill is now at the head of the calender, as unfinished business, and will come up each day after the morning hour. Monday next the president's message and the usual exchange of communication be tween the houses will occup y the day. On Tuesday it will be the duty of the presiding officer to lay the unfinished business before the senate at 2 o'clock. This will be the tariff bill, and it will depend on Senator Allison, who has it in charge, whether its consideration will be resumed on that day. Before the adjournment of the last session, Senator Allison said he would cill the tariff bill up at tte earliest pes?ible moment, and he declared that he w6uld resist any lengthy adjournment for the holidays in order to facilitate its passage. Beforo leaving Iowa, Senator Allison said that he would await an intimation from the democratic leaders in the house, promising a proposition to agree on a tariff bill, but while at Indianapolis, and after a consultation with General Har rison last Tuesday, he is reported to have returned to his original programme the immediate consideration of the republican bill. Regarding the general policy of the re publicans touching the measure, he said they might probably make some change in it, but not any of importance, and the bill would remain substantially the same. Sena tor Spoorer, who was with Senator Allison in Indianapolis, made a etiteinent similar to that of Senator Allison; ard these utter ances indicate that it is the desire of Gen eral Harrison and the purpose of the lead ers to push the tariff bill through the senate, and substantially in its present form. It tony, therefore, be expected that the senate will take up the tariff bill thi3 week. "Away OrT the TrcV." Chicago, December The Daily News publishes an interview with Senator Far well in which he is quoted as saying: "My visit to General Harrison was a so cial one, of oourse, but ha told me some thing that shows that yoa newspaper men are away off the track, as it were, iu your special allegations regarding President-elect Harrison's plans. " 'Senator,' he said to me last Wednes day, "I have got big ears, and a very little mouth; there is more talk about my alleged intentions than I ever dreamed there could be. But I will tell you one thing, and that is this: I do not propose to offtr, promise or appoint any men to offices for some time to come. Some of my predecessors, as soon as elected, adopted the course of at once n.a'iiLig promisrs, and quieting this or that faction by promises. Some of our presi dents succeeded so well that tey gave away more oiiices than they had at their disposal, and the resuit was not exactly a they wished. I shall do nothing cf the kind. I shall look about me, caref ully examine ev ery tldng, end then be very deliberate about my selections, making no piouniscs th 1 am not absolutely certain that I can fulrii." Vo Eevolt of Importance. New Yoke, Decembers. The Sun prints an interview with leading cV.mocrats ia the a. A. 11. in various parts of the country. In review cf these interviews, it says 'The movement for the withdrawal of democrtdio members of the G. A. R., on the ground that the organization is used to further the political ends of the republican party seems to meet wita little sympathy outside of In diana, where it began. The revolt has been organized in Indianapolis, but in no other state have steps in that direction been re ported. Interviews by the Sun correspond ents with many prominent democrats in tha Grand Army show that they will not join the revolt, that they had no idea that it wuum uo important, ir.ey distinctly contra dict the Assertion of General Palmer that the Grand Army is an adjunct of the repub blican party; deny as an organization it has any partisan bia. They also sy there is not room for another successful organiza tion of veterans. In fact, the interviews seem to indicate that as a rule the results of the election have not shaken the fealty of democratic veterans to the Grand Army, however its individual members may vote. It was organized aud is maintained, they believe, for non-political purposes. An American's Opiniun of Mexico. Washington, D. C, Dec 2. Mr. Thomas B. Coanery, lata Secretary of the Legation in Mexico is in the city. He speaks in terms indicating a warm friendship for the Mexican Government and people, to whom he become friendly attached while at the Mexican Capital. He 6ay3 the Mexicans are not very well understood by Americans, be cause they differ in their ideas on most things from us. The Germans and tha French get along very well with them, be cause they put up with delays that our peo ple would not tolerate. He reports that Mexico is making real progress. They have men of great ability among them and their President is a good one. The MexicaLB are slow to adopt new ideas and new customs, and he ventures the opinion that those who have built railroads into Mexico will not be reimbursed for some time. The people do not build towns ahout a station there aathey do in the United States, but get as far away from a road as possible. The Mexicans are slow to see the advantages of this great mod era civilizer, but the roads must become popular in coarse of lime. R:Ues Advanced. Chicago, December 3. A meeting of the managers of the !ine3 ia the Central TraSIo association was held to consider the ques tion of restoring all east bound freight rates. There was no difficulty in reaching an agreement to advanc? the rate on grain and provisions to the old rate of 25 anJ 30 cents respectively, but when it cams to re storing dre;Gd beef and live stack rates the trouble began. The managers whose op position to the differential system was one of the causes leading to the dressed beef dispute, seamed to have changed their po sition on that question, and as iho lines which were formerly allowed a diferet-tiil rate on dressed beef feel that they are enti tled cow to the same privileges, tho contro versy was renewed. The meeting finally adjourned without reaching a conclusion, but the sentiment seemed to be that alt difficulties would be overcome no-, nud that rates would be advanced, to take effect about December 12. Trade and Finance. New Yoek, Deoember 3. R. G. Dunn & Co., in their weekly review of trade, say: The outgo of gold, and the situation of speculative markets cause lower prices in almost every branch, but in stocks some recovery has followed the reports of new and important agreements between railroad managers. The rise averaging about SO cents psr share for the more active stocks does not yet appear to indicate a change of tone. A combination on an entirely new basis, for roads west of Chicago, is pro posed, of which a vital feature, is an entire withdrawal of the power to make rates from subordire. I .:! tha clearing house scheme, if accepted literally, would virtualy take the power from the officers of 6acn road, separately, and tha hearty consent of all competing iine3 being necessary the re ports that one or more will refuse to thus surrender their power seems to foreshadow the failure of the plan. Declared rnconstitutional. Lansing, Mich., December 3. The su preme court hau tfpclared the libel law of 1S85 unconstitutional. The law requires that the plaintiff in the suit shall only re cover actual damages if it appears that the publication was made in good faith and its falsity was due to a mistake or misappre hension of the fact3, and that in the next regular issue of the newspaper after said mistake or misapprehension comes to the knowledge of the publisher, whether before or after suit is brought, a correction is pub lished in as conspicuous manner and place as the libelous article occupied. Charges Ayalusc an Operator. Colobado Speings, Con., December 3. The coroner's jury holding an inquest over the bodies of W. H. Phipps and J. H. Flinn, two men killed in a collision on the Denver and Rio Grande railroad on Monday, con cluded its investigation aud returned a ver dict charging C. A. C. Wood, at this point, with carelessness. The verdict says that neither of the two roads was directly re sponsible for the accident. Mr. Wood has disappeared and his whereabou"s are un known. It has not yet bean decided wketh er an effort will be made to find him. The Direct Tax Hill. Washington, D. C, December 3. There is much uncertainty expressed at the capitol as to the fate of the direct tax bill, which the committee on rules by caucus action was directed to make a special order for Thursday, the Cth of December. The oppo nent, who at the last session made a suc cessful tight against its consideration, evince an entire absence of knowledge as to wheth er or not the caucus programme will be car ried out, "but say it is highly improbable that dilatory tactics again be employed t compass the defeat of the measure. An Early etlleuuent l'robable. New Yoe2, December 3. The Times says: President Chauncey M. Depew says the main purposes of the fight between the Eastern trunk lines has now been accom plished and a speedy settlement of the sen sational rate war between the New York Central and the Pennsylvania roads can be counted upon. An officer in the Pennsyl vania company authorizes the statement that steps wiil be taken at a meeting in Chicago to restore ail east bound rates to their old figtres. Kansas Legljdation. Topesa, Kan., December 3. Committees from the city councils of a'l cities of the first class in the state met here and discussed the changes which should be made by the next legislature in laws for the government of first ciass cities.
