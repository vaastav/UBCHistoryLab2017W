Mines and Mining. TWO FEET GOOD ORE THE C. M. & D. CO. IS NOT WORK ING IN BARREN GROUND. PECK CONCENTRATOR CLOSED It Still Has Several Months Work in .Sight—Started in on More Than 1,000,000 Tons of Rich Tailings. Information was received yesterday from the property of the Colorado Min ing & Development company, located near Corbin, Jefferson county, to the ef fect that a two-foot body of very fine ore had been struck in the drift, which is being driven along the hanging wall of the vein. The information came from J. D. McClellan, the foreman. The lead of the property is said to be 1C feet wide, but it is not all over. There are, however, two streaks of good pay ore, one on the hanging wall and the other on the foot. To catch the pay shoot a crosscut was driven from the 200-foot station into the lead. The drift is now in about 50 feet. Manager Heil bronner says that a new boiler has just been added to the battery and that an additional 100 feet will be added to the shaft at once. There is a tunnel on the property in which a winze has been sunk and as soon as the shaft reaches the 300 mark a crosscut will be driven into the lead and a raise made to connect it with the winze. This will give the workings plenty of ventilation and at the same time de velop the vein. In the same district as that in which the property is located Paris Gibson of Great Falls and J. J. Hill, Jr., son of James J. Hill of the Great Northern railroad, are developing a claim on which they have sunk HO feet and are bound for the 200 mark. The lead on their claim, it is said, is 30 feet wide. Postmaster English of Anaconda is developing the surprise there. He is now crosscutting from a tunnel, but will soon begin deepening the old shaft. It is reported that A. B. Knight and others have leased the Dojney claim on which there has been more than 1000 feet of tunnel work done.

MINING AROUND SHERIDAN. Ore Can Now Be Shipped From That Section at a Profit. Ore is being shipped from Sheridan regularly and it is proving quite a convenience for the mine owners and teamsters to load at this point, I says the Sheridan Chinook. The haul I from nearly all the property is I down hill and good roads. It is I safe to say that the shipments will in crease 25 per cent, as much low grade ore I can be handled at a profit now. Hereto ! fore the expense of handling the ore and hauling to Twin Bridges ate up the mar» ; gin. The miners seem as though they I realize the difference as they are secur I ing leases daily and working their own properties. The Chinook is pleased to state that the bond on the Comet has been taken up by the Wall street Mining company through W. H. Godfrey of Gr at Falls. The property was formerly owned by Dave Keneallv, Tat Balsam and Tim Reardon. These gentlemen speak in the highest terms of praise of Mr. Godfrey in his dealings with them. It is gratify ing to know that such men as Mr. God frey will become interested in this dis trict. A carload of ore was shipped Saturday from this point by Charley Bergsttom and John Lindfors, who are working the Lake mine on Mill creek. Mr. Berg strom has leased the interests of Havt- ! land & Miller in the mine. The ore was j sent to the Colorado smelter at Butte. : Ed Wright and Will Fenton wer ■ in town the first of the week item the E-sex near the Montana group. The boys have ! been cross-cutting for the lead v.h'ch ; they think is not many feet from the present workings. Some good gold ore ! has been taken from the property. i A new lease has been secured on the I Keynote by Raber & Eastrldge. A good I portion of the ore has been stoped out in the old workings and the boys will have ■ to do some dead work before shipments i are resumed. ! Williams & Klenze are work'ng a claim at Brandon. They are running a cross cut tunnel and expect to tap the lead at a depth of 75 feet. The ore is a pyrite and carries good values in gold and sil ver. E. O.

Mr. Brissette is representing the Bunker Hill which j ! j j ; I i i I j j was owned by George Balter, who was killed at Rochester In a mine explosion. . The St. Lawrence mine near Virginia City has been leased to Robert Bailey and Charlie Fuller of Sheridan. They have moved up to the mine and will be gin taking out ore In the near future. It Is reported that the Big Show com pany is extracting some very rich ore from their claims in Georgia gulch. Wm. Fluhrer is looking after the work.

IMPORTANT IF TRUE. Cinnibar Said to Have Been Found in the Thunder Mountain District. S. E. Edwards, the well-known pros peetor and mining man, is in from the Thunder Mountain country, says the Boise. Idaho, Statesman. He brings posi tive evidence that cinnabar (quicksilver ore) is to be found there in quantity. IJ has secured samples of high-grade cin nabar from a claim owned by Prindlo Smith. The ore is very hand: ome. the spoci mens easily run 35 per cent quicksilver, These, it is probable, were picked sam ples given Mr. Edwards by the owner. but the former says the entire ledge wil: run from 15 to 20 per cent "quick." The vein is 10 to 15 feet in width, making .1 very fine proposition. Here, as always in a cinnabar deposit, there is no regular defined vein of the quicksilver proper. That comes in con nection with certain formations known to those accustomed to mining cinnabar. The allied material, if the deposit is per manent, is always in well defined ledges with perfect walls, and desseminated throughout it is the cinnabar. Tne Thunder Mountain deposit lies be tween perfect walls, the hanging wall be ing shale and the foot wall granite. It is some miles this side of the Thunder Mountain discovered by the Caswells, where there is no granite whatever. The cinnabar is probably within the granit zone about two miles. This insures the stability of the country, there being no breaks or faults, so far as known. The present ^ alue of quicksilver is 55 cents per pound. It is sold in flasks con taining 72 'é pounds each. There are few quicksilver mines in the United States, the largest (and the only property worked continuously) being in Central California. At the best of these proper ties the ledge is but 6 feet in width and the average of the ore is less than 8 per cent. It is run very profitably. The properly is equipped with a smelter \yith capacity equal to the normal output of the mine. For a great many years large numbers of prospectors have hunted for cinnabar, but without success, there being no large deposits of the mineral. Whenever the least indication was found, there were plenty of moneyed men to send expert« to -nvestigate. Cinnabar, though, is a pe culiar» mineral in that it is often found in pockets hundreds of miles from anoth er deposit. It is oftentimes called a mineral freak of nature because of this peculiarity. Mr. Edwards, in commenting on this discovery, said yesterday afternoon that never before had he known of a pros pect of cinnabar to be more favorable from every point of view. Fearing that it was only a pocket, Mr. Smith, imme diately upon discovery, began a system atic development for exploiting purposes. He sunk potholes at short intervals alon^ the ledge—it was always true, and with the average of the ore—15 to 20 per cent—maintained the full length of two claims. The indications are that the develop ment of this new discovery will result In great quicksilver mines In Idaho. If true, mining men say it will mean more than anything else in the mining indus try of the state, as this mineral Is in especial demand, and its place of pro duction upon a commercial scale is known and remembered by every mining man throughout the world.
