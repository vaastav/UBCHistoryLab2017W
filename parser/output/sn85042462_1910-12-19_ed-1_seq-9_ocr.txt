SHEEPMEN OPPOSE PROGRAM OF TAFT President's Latest Message to Come in for Grilling by Na tional Wool Growers NOTED SPEAKERS SECURED Annual Convention Scheduled to Meet in Portland January 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Stiorlal to The Hrrald) PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 18.—That Tint's latest message will come in for a grilling; at the hands ol' the wool growers of America at the annual con vention, .scheduled for Portland Janu ary 4, 5, 6 and 7. is the frank predic tion of sheep raisers. This message holds out little hope to'the wool grow ers, and they regard It as settled that he regards the wool and woolens sched ule as indefensible, for he has said so mi a number of occasions. It Is felt that so long as President Tafl feels that a majority of tho peo ple want the schedule revised, whether the industry will be. wrecked or not, he will stand by his original program for the reopening of the schedule and some < hanges in the duties on wool and wool i us, although he has stated on. numer ous occasions, It is said, that fcp Is not after the wool growers, but rattier the manufacturers. Growers are naturally hoping that congress will not dig Into Ow tariff on wool until the tariff board hits' had a chance to report. The fear tp general, however, that revision of srtiedule X Is inevitable, and this is (.-auirtng a de pressed feeling among sheepmen every where. The. tariff talk that will be heard will be a big feature of the com ing convention. Strong speakers have been secured to discuss the, situation and advise a way out. Edward Molr, president of the Carded Woolens Man ufacturers' association, will speak on "Schedule K. from the Standpoint of tho Carded Woolen Manufacturers."

ISTHMUS FREIGHT TOTALS MILLIONS Government Reports on Merchan dise Moved Across Panama and Tehuantepec in Year AMAZING GROWTH OF TRADE Sugar Sent from Hawaii for Eastern Cities Figures in Enormous Quantity (Special to Th« Herald) WASHINGTON. Deo. 18.—Eighty-two million dollars' worth of merchandise originating In the United States crossed the Isthmuses of Panama and Tehuan tepec last year. Most of this merchan dise was moved across the Isthmuses for the mere purpose of transferring it from one great section of the United States to another section; from thai eastern to the western coast, or from the western coast and the Pacific islands to the eastern coast. Fifty mil lion dollars' worth of this grand total originated on the eastern coast and moved westward across the Isthmuses, four-fifths of It passing thence north ward to the Pacific coast of the United States, the other one-fifth being dis tributed along the Pacific coasts of Mexico, Central and South America. The other $32,000,000 worth of this grand total moved eastwardly across the Isthmuses, two-thirds of it origi nating In Hawaii and the remainder along the western coast of the United States. The Hawaiian sugar destined for the eastern coast of the United States, which formerly marie the trip by sailing vessels around Cape Horn. now passes by steamer to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, is there transferred to the railway, carried across the isthmus and again placed on steamers passing thence to the refineries at Philadelphia, and New York. The steamer* carrying this sugar return from New York load ed with general merchandise, which is transferred to the Tehuantepec rail way, crossing the isthmus, and re transferred to steamers which pan up the western coast of the United States to Sun Diego, San Francisco and Puget sound, and then, returning to Hawaii, reload with sugar lor the eastward trip. RAILWAY FACILITATES TRADE This transisthmian traffic between the eastern and western coasts of the United States and between the eastern coast of tho United States and the western coast of Central and South America has greatly increased in re cent years. In the fiscal year 1905 it aggregated but $8,000,000: in 1910 it was over $80,000,000, or ten times as much. This increase is the result in part of the opening, on January 1, 1907, of the railway across the Isthmus of Tehuan tepec, Mexico, 190 miles in length, op erated in conjunction with lines of ocean steamers at either end and sup plied with facilities for transferring freight from Rtcamer to railway and from railway to steamer. The value of its trafllc in merchandise originating in and destined for ports of the United States has grown from about $23,000,000 in the calendar year 1907, the first year of its operation, to $70,000,000 in the fiscal year 1910. In the meantime the value of American merchandise cross ing by •way of the Panama railway, largely occupied at the present time with ithe service incident to the con struction of the Panama canal, has grown from $9,500,000 in the fiscal year 1907 to $12,730,000 in the fiscal year 1910. Practically all the American traffic carried across the Isthmus of Tehuan tepec passes between the eastern and western coast ports of the United States, including the Hawaiian islands, while about three-fourths of that car ried over the Panama line passes be tween ports of the United States, and about two-iifths between domestic ports and ports of foreign countries. Of the $41,000,000 worth of American merchandise passing westward over the Tehuantepec line last year, $23,000, --000 worth went to San Francisco; $9,000,000 to San Diego; $1,500,000 worth to Puget sound; $3,500,000 worth to Hawaii; and $750,000 worth to foreign countries. Central America, Mexico and British Columbia. Of the $28,000,000 worth passing eastward over tho Te huantepec line, $20,000,000 worth, chiefly sugar, was from Hawaii, $6,000,000 from San Francisco, and $1,333,000 worth from Puget sound. Of the $9.2. r)0,000 worth passing westward over the Pan ama line, $5,000,000 worth was destined for foreign countries on the west coast of America and $4,250,000 worth to the Pacific coast of the United States, chiefly Ran Francisco; while of the $3,500,000 worth passing eastward over that lino, the entire amount was from tho port of San Francisco. This large and rapidly growing traffic between the eastern coast of the United States and western ports of America, consists, as relates to the westward movement, of miscellaneous merchan dise, while about one-third of the eastern movement is miscellaneous merchandise and about two-thirds sugar from Hawaii. All of the west bound merchandise for western ports of the United States or ports of foreign countries fronting upon the Pacific was shipped from the port of New York, while of that passing eastward across the transisthmian lines $20,000,000 was from Hawaii, $9,500,000 from San Fran cisco and $1,300,000 worth from Pugct sound. __ 

CHIEF JUSTICE WILL TAKE OATH AT CAPITAL TODAY Edward Douglas White to Occupy Cane Chair on Bench WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.—Justice Kci ward Douglas White will take the oath of office as chief justice of the United States supreme court tomorrow, ac cording to present arrangements. His commission has been forwarded to the clerk and all plans for the ceremony have been completed.

Instead of a leather upholstered chair, occupied by the otner members, Chief Justice White will be found seat ed in a cooler cane chair. An electric light will burn before him when ho reads. This will not be to distinguisli him from the other members, but will be used because the chief Justice haa found it difficult to read in the natural light in the supreme court room.

CONGRESS CLEARS FILES FOR RECESS Supply Bills to Be Hurried and Adjournment Taken Until January 5 WASHINGTON, Dec. IS.—Congress Is expected to adjourn Wednesday for the holiday recess and not to resume business until January 5. The resolu tion, which passed the house, probably will be brought up in the senate to morrow. No objection to the program has appeared, as it is practically cer tain that half a dozen of the big sup ply bills will be out of the way by Wednesday night. Business before both houses thus far has not stimulated much public in terest and seats in the galleries have gone begging. The omnibus claims bill in the senate has failed to attract crowds and the appropriation bills In the house proved no better magnet. DREARY SESSIONS IN SENATE Outside of the claims bill there has been no business before the senate ex cept the Cummins resolution to change the rules of the senate and house so as to facilitate piecemeal revision of the tariff. Indications are that tho resolu tion will be sent to the senate rules committee before the recess. Tin." rules committee is generally be lieved to be opposed to the adoption of any measure which would undertake to deal with the rules of the house. The indications are that some measures may" be reported out which would give the senate an opportunity of voting on some form of cloture for itself. The question of legislation to create a permanent tariff commission is al ready gaining more attention in the house than In the senate, where there has been a disposition to await the out come of conferences being held by Rep resentatives Longworth of Ohio, Goodc of lowa and Lenroot of Wisconsin. TARIFF BOARD ENLARGEMENT Whether these members are about to harmonize their differences has not been clear. It is in the house as a whole that there is sentiment generally for the enlargement of the tariff board and making its existence continuous for at least six years. Some members favor making the life of the commis sion ten years, while others favor twenty years. Most serious of all ques tions involved is that of giving the commission power to demand books and papers of corporations. Many members favor having the commission call for such documents when they be lieve them necessary and in the event of refusal to make reports to congress with a view to separata action in each case. The rpport of the Rallinger-Pinchot investigation is still slumbering in the houie committee on agriculture. Min ority members of tho committee are threatening to demand a report from the committee on agriculture so that a vote on the merits of the majority and minority views might be had in the house, but no .step in that direction hai yet been taken. There appears little prospect of action in the senate. JUSTICE HUGHES NOT NURSING A GRIEVANCE WASHINGTON, Dec. IS.—There has been much gossip in political "ircles in Washington following thu elevation oi' Associate Justice White to the chief justiceship of the supreme court of the United States. This gossip has cen tered to a great extent in the supposi tion that the failure of President Taft to fulfill the expectation, general in Washington, that Associate Justice Hughes woulJ receive this promotion, would leave the latter in a position whereby he would be available for a Republican presidential nomination i.i 1912. Those in the confidence of Jus tice Hughes know he is distressed by this talk, especially so by the infer ence in some quarters that he is nurs ing a grievance because he was not promoted to the. chief justiceship. Justice Hughes has sti iulfastly re fused, since his elevation to the su preme court bench, to talk for publi cation, nevertheless it can be 3aid with unqualified earnestness and best authority that he harbors no such grievance; that h" waa never promised the chief Justiceship; that he recog nizes the fitness and propriety of the appointment of Justice' White as chief justice; that he is not and does not intend ever to be a candidate for the presidency, and particularly that he is happy in his work rind desires to ho left alono to do it to the best of his ability Artists in Fist Fight; Models Quit Posing and Join Fracas 

PARIS, Dec. 18.—The cafe known as the Dome, recently described as the capital of the American half of the Latin quarter, where present day Trilbies foregather, was the scene last night of a lively battle between an American and a Frenchman, in which their models took part. A young New Yorker who is studying architecture at the Beaux Arts here entered the cafe with a model. In passing along he insulted a French man with another model. It is the general impression among newly arrived American students that Frenchmen won't fight with their flsts. This New Yorker had an un pleasant surprise. The Frenchman, who Is considerably smaller, promptly resented the insult and started 'a fight in which he was getting the better of the American when the models butted in. They began throwing glasses, one of which narrowly mirsed two New Yorkers in evening dress who had gone to the cafe to see the sights of the artist quarter. Another glass struck a model and badly cut her face. Tables were overturned and the fight was becoming general when one of the waiters informed an American sculptor who was playing cards that the Frenchman had a revolver and was likely to use it. Then the sculptor took a hand. The Frenchman tried to get hold of a billiard cue, but the sculptor knocked him down. The proprietor, waiters and visitors then separated the fighters, putting all into the streets. The Frenchman went away with his model, swearing that he would com plain to the police. Expulsion from France would be likely to follow for the Americans if the police should learn their identity. 

GRAHAME-WHITE SUFFERS SLIGHT INJURY IN FALL Winner of International Cup Cut on Face in Mishap at Dover DOVER, Eng.. Dec. 188.—Claude Gra hame-White, the English aviator, who recently won the International aviation cup at Belmont Park, had a narrow escape from serious injury today. His machine was wrecked and he was badly cut about the face. May aviators have been waiting here for the last fortnight to compete for the prizt! of $20,000 offered by Baron De Forest for the longest flight across the English channel in 1910, the flight to be made by an Englishman in an English built machine. Grahame-AVhite this morning as cended for a trial flight in a strong wind. His machine began to rock and he was unable, to restore its equilib rium. It turned over and plunged to the ground and was completely wrecked. The aviator fell a little to one side. It was thought at first he had suf fered concussion of the brain, as ho was unconscious, but he soon revived, and it was found that he had received nothing more than bad cuts about the face. It is expected he will bo about within a week. He has ordered an other biplane of the Wright type from Bristol and will make another attempt to will the prize. A second competitor, Boprlth, fared better. Ho left East church, Shippey island, at 8:15 o'clock in the morning, crossed from Dover to Calais and de scended at Beaumont, Belgium, a dis tance of 174 miles. In hi! trial flight Crahame-White had descended to within 10U feet of the ground when his machine began to waver. His actual fall probably did not exceed seventy feet. Snprith completed his flight of 174 miles within three and one-half hours. This Is the first time a British made aeroplane has crossed the channel, and in addition it is a record for distance under the conditions provided. No tugs or other craft followed the aviator and no other precautions were taken against accident. BOTTLE FROM SHIPWRECKED CREW COMES ACROSS OCEAN SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 18.—A bottle containing an appeal for help from shipwrecked sailors in far away New Zealand was washed up on the beach near Ocean View today and found by Martin Muloney. The following mes sage is written on a page from a mem ornndum book: "Help wanted quick; latitude 37 de grees, :!0 minutes, 30 seconds north: longitude 180 decrees, 28 minutes, 35 ■econdl. Island reef to the north. Food all gone except one cask of hardtack." Tlio note was signed: "Captain John won, schooner Daylight, Tahiti. Sailed June 1. 1910. Fifty-foot schooner." The location described in the note la jUHt off the north point of North isl iUiii, New Zealand, and in dirm-t path of the ocean current that sweeps by the island with its course toward San Francisco OIL AS FUEL IN U. S. NAVY IS SUCCESSFUL California Leads Country in In crease of Production, Re port Shows WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.—The use of oil as fuel on railroads of the United States greatly increased last year, and the results of its introduction into the United States navy have fully met ex pectations. Steamship companies also are equipping their vessels with oil burners. In the navy two battleships —the North Dakota and the Delaware were thus equipped, and four battle ships now in course of construction will burn oil as auxiliary to coal. Fifteen destroyers also will be thus equipped. In several European countries similar : experiments are r. w being made. The consumption by the railroads in i 1909 amounui to 19,939.394 barrels, an i increase of 3,050,324 barrels, or 18 per cent over the previous year. Though the production of oil in tbll country for 1909 was a slight increase over tho production for the preceding year, there was a decline in value con sistent with the market. The total i production in 1909 was 182.134,274 bar rels, as compared with 178,528,355 bar rels in 1908. Tho value of tho 1909 production was $125,243,783, while that of 1908 WM valued at $129,079,184. California, Oklahoma and "West Vir ginia added greatly to the increase in production. California gained 21.35 per cent; Oklahoma, 4.5 per cent, while West Virginia increased 12.83 per cent. Utah and Wyoming produced only 22, --137 barrels. This was a Rain of 24.55 per cent over their combined output in 19US. All other states showed a decrease, tho greatest being in Louisiana, which de clined 47.15 per cent. PRISONERS ASSAULT SHERIFF, FOUR ESCAPE LIMA, Ohio, Dec. IS.—Four prison ers in the county jail here won their way to freedom today after a murder ous asault on Sheriff Van Gurten. Standing over his unconscious father the sheriff's 15-year-old son held the remaining six convicts at bay with an empty rifle until help came. Charles Collins, Spencer Stevens, William Evans and Herman Bergei ■were the men who escaped. Berger and Evans were afterwards recaptured but their companions are still at liberty. The men wrenched off the prongs ot the inner prison door with an iron bar taken from one of the beds. As the prisoners made a rush for liberty Sheriff Van Gurten ran out of his of fice and was struck down by Collins, who carried the iron bar. His two sons had followed him and the younger, snatching up an empty rifle, ordered the men buck to their cplls. Four of them pushed past him, but the rest obeyed. The sheriff's condition is serious. PASTOR ENCOURAGES USE OF LETTERS FOR ADVICE Rev. Charles E. Locke Appealed to in Epistles Dr. Charles Edward Locke opened what he called "the pastor's letter tmx" at the First Methodlft Church last evening. The choir wing- Handel's "Meaalah" In celebration of the ap proaching Christmas. Dr. Locke .said Bf bad received many loiters anil ques tions during recent weeks and some of these he would endeavor to answer. Dr. Locke laid: 1. "I have been asked what I thought of the, rendition of a certain sensational musical comedy which Is advertised for this city this Week. Somebody sent me a printed announcement freely illustrated. It Is passing Strange that such performances sre allowed any where; but, so far a?! I can see, it is only a trifle worse than things which are permitted every week in this city. This particular play can never be made respectable, no matter what elimina tions or censorship may take place. .. "A troubled wife sends me a pli ailing letter asking me if I will not lift up my voice against 'The Curse of the Hotel Bars' She .says: 'I know from personal knowledge that these places are doing more harm to the bet ter classes of men, both young and Old, thnn any saloon in the city.' Alas'. Alas! This old demon of drink! Its hydra-head is always reappearing. No joubt many prosperous men are going to the devil by these gilt-edged places, but the hell to which they are d 'scend ing is just as deep and deadly as if tin y went by way of the doggery. Let us keep up the fight! It has been a long struggle, hut sobriety and charac ter must win at last."
