8 AFFAIRS IN THE ISLAND OF CUBA. General Wade Pays a Visit to Gen eral Oastellanos. The Meeting of the Two Officers of a Most Cordial Nature. The American Received With Mil itary Courtesy and Honors Fully iv Keeping With His Rank, and in Sharp Contrast to the Sys tem Which Prevailed Under the Regime of Captain General Blanco. HAVANA (via Key West), Dec. 7.— The official visit of General Wade as President of the Cuban Evacuation Commission to General Castellanos at the palace to-day was marked by a dis play of official and military courtesy and honors fully in keeping with the rank of the visiting officer, and in sharp contrast to the system which prevailed under the regime of Captain General Blanco, when the ceremonies were to tally disregarded. General Wade's visit was merely an official call on the Captain General, and was of brief duration. It was re quired by military etiquette. The meet ing of the two officers was of a ?nost cordial nature, and expressions of mu tual regard were exchanged. General Wade was accompanied by his entire staff. The local press shows a sharp divi sion in the comments upon President McKinley's message to Congress. "El Pais" and "La Lucha" find an analogy between the message and the joint resolution of April last, constitut ing, in their opinion, proof that the United States Government is "really determined to carry out the promises solemnly contracted before the world. : ' On the other hand, "El Diaro de ia Marina," "Universal Advisador," "El Commercio," "La Union Iberia" and "El Leon Espanola" see in the message a veiled admission that the President's policy is to occupy the island for an indefinite period, with a view to ulti mately annexing it. papers loudly denounce the passage in the message which urges co-operation and assistance in every possible form from social and moral reconstruction of the island, in order to enable the people of Cuba to govern themselves. The idea of qualifying the Cubans to administer their own affairs is represented by this section of the press as "an insulting warning." A dispatch from Trinidad, province of Santa Clara, announces the landing at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon at Ca silda, the port of Trinidad, of General Snyder and 700 United States troops. The Fulda left this morning or Ca diz with 1,077 Spanish troops. All statues of Spanish royal person ages now in the public parks will soon be taken down for shipment to Spain. The cruiser New York, which left Newport News on December 3d, arriv ed off the harbor at 3:55 p. m. AT 

SANTIAGO DE CUBA. SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Dec. 7.—To day is the anniversary of the death of General Antonio Maceo. and has been celebrated among the Cubans in San tiago. A memorial service was held this morning in the Cathedral, which was crowded. Considerable annoyance was occa sioned to the United States authorities by the fact that some seventy-five men, Cubans, marched the entire length of St. Thomas street, armed with rifles and machetes, although all Cubans are well aware that such conduct is strict ly against the regulations, armed bod ies, other than United States troops, not being allowed. The armed squad fired three volleys, many of them using ball cartridges, whose bullets, striking the upper portions of the Cathedral, caused the bell ringers to flee from their post. An officer from the Fifth Immune Jtegiment soon arrived at headquarters with a message from Colonel Sargent stating that several bullets had struck his tent at different points, and asking information as to the cause. Colonel Garcia said he was under theh impres sion that the men used blank car tridges, and that the United States au thorities had been notified of the in tention of a number of men to march armed in connection with the celebra tion. Colonel Beacom ordered Colonel Gar cia not to allow his men to attend the evening procession a "mod, and said he •would permit the continuance of the morning cel?oraton on the understand ing that there was to be no f'.ring. The sole reason why the offenders were not arrested was that they were within the Cathedral limits at 'he time. A band of Cubans on horseback en tered the premises of the >~anish Club here this evening and broke several large lamps .vitn their machetes. The United States authorities- acted prompt ly. As a result of the outrage, ac least half of the police will be discharged. f ANGLO-AMERICAN TREATY. It May Be Concluded Before the Christmas Holidays. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The Anglo- American Commission] has been ob liged to rearrange its sessions, making them from 9:30 to 11:30 a. m. daily, in order to permit Senators Fairbanks and Faulkner and Representative Dingley, who are members, to attend their Con gressional duties. After to-day's session it wa* stated that the outlook for concluding A treaty was fairly good, although it wVs not yet certain that such a result cohld be brought about. If a treaty is made, the expectation is that it will be con cluded before the holidays. The subjects at present under consid eration, it is stated, include reciprocity and the fisheries, and while the Com missioners are quite guarded, the idea is conveyed that reciprocity presents the most serious problem for solution before the way is clear to a treaty. Senator Fairbanks has entertained the distinguished British members of the commission at the Senate end of Capitol, and Representative Dingley will extend a similar courtesy at the House end. It is understood that the session to day brought more t, definite develop ments on the important reciprocity question than have been secured here tofore, and that the American side pre sented a schedule telling about how far it was possible to go on this sub ject. Although the commission will authorize no statement, intelligent ob servers of its work say that the Amer ican proposition probably includes con cessions on barley, live animals, agri cultural products and certain ores, and possibly also some concessions on coal. It is understood not to make conces sions on lumber, which is the item on which the Canadian officials have been most desirous of securing reductions. It is said the concessions which the Americans are willing to give are con erably short of what the British- Canadian side had expected and had even felt to be essential as an offer to concessions already tentatively made on some other branches of the negotia tions. 

NATIONAL GUARD. Should he Reorganized on Same Baals as the Army. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. — Colonel Marsh, Chairman of the Committee on Militia, is determined to look after the interests of the National Guard, and will in the near future either take up a bill which he introduced at the tail session for the reorganization of the National Guard or draft a new one which will conform with the changes to be made in the formation of the reg ular army. He says that his bill meets all the exigencies of the occasion, but before taking any action he prefers to wait until the meeting on December loth at Milwaukee of those who are interested in the welfare of the National Guard to learn if they have any 2,'iggesticns to make, and also to wait until Con gress has provided for an increase in the regular army. Colonel Marsh is a firm believer in the theory that the militia should be organized on the same basis us the army, so as to avoid in the future any mistakes and drawbacks which were met with during the war just ended. MAJOR GENERAL WHEELER Will be Relieved From Further Active Duty. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Major Gen eral Wheeler probably has seen his last active service in the United States army. He was at the War Depart ment to-day and had a talk with Secre tary Allger and Adjutant General Cor bin. It is understood he will be reliev ed from further active duty unless there is a recurrence of war, but that he will remain on the active list of the United States volunteer army until that army is mustered out of the service by the declaration of peace. This privilege is accorded to him in recognition of his distinguished services, and will leave General Wheeler free to etercise his functions as a member of the House of Representatives during this session. ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE. Proceedings of the Convention in Session at Cleveland. CLEVELAND, Dec. 7.—At to-day's session of the Anti-Saloon League, Rev. Howard H. Russell, the Superintendent, read his annual report. It gave in de tail the work for the past year and showed gratifying progress. The annual address of the President, Hon. Hiram Price, was heard with a gieat deal of interest.

At the conclusion of the President's address the reports of the committees were made. The members of the vari ous committees for the ensuing year were appointed. 

JOHN SHERMAN'S VIEWS. Hopes the Senate Will Reject the Peace Treaty. BOSTON, Dec. 7.—At a meeting of the Anti-Imperialist League Executive Com mittee to-day a letter was read from John Sherman saying: "My hope is that the Senate of the United States will reject the treaty, and leave the people free from the shackles of Spain and the distant domination of the United States. I sympathize with Aguinaldo in his ambition to found a republic in the China Sea, near the Equator, and hope he may become the Washington of a new nation, abso lutely free from European and Ameri can influence." Sails for Home. KINGSTON (Jamaica), Dec. 7—Unit ed States Customs Commissioner Rob ert H. Porter arrived here from Cuba yesterday on board the Admiral Samp son, and sailed for home to-day. He said his investigations indicated the desirability of reciprocity between Cuba and the United States, in spite of the Louisiana sugar and Florida to bacco trade. The Commissioner has .framed a Cuban tariff which will be promulgated on his arrival home. It opens the Cuban market to all nations on equal terms. Commissioner Porter considers the Cubans perfectly fit for self- government. Cleveland Opposed to Expansion. PRINCETON (N. J.), Dec. 7.—Grover Cleveland was interviewed to-day on the policy of the United States, and dic tated the following for the Associated Press: "Without going at all into de tails, I wish to say that I am ardently opposed to every feature of this annex ation and expansion policy. The pub lic ought to know pretty well what my convictions are, from the Hawaiian question during my administration. I have not changed my mind, and remain opposed to all of this annexation, from Hawaii to the Philippines.'' Sharkey and McCoy Matched. NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—The "Press" to-morrow will say: "Tom Sharkey and Kid McCoy have been matched to fight twenty rounds before the Lenox Athletic .Club in this city for a purse of $20,000.

TiiE RECOBB-VKIOy, SACRAMENTO, THTTBSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898, THE MONADNOCK'S VOYAGE TO MANILA. Details of the Remarkable Trip Made by the Monitor Told in the Report of Captain Whiting to the Navy Department. Bestows Great Praise Upon the Ex ecutive Officer, Chief Engineer and Crew of the Warship for the Energy and Ability Dis played and Hardships Endured Throughout the Voyage. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The Navy Department has just made public a report from Captain Whiting, who commanded the Monadnock on the voyage from San Francisco to Manila, in which the latter, after telling of some of the hardships endured during the trip, pays a well-deserved compli ment to the energy and ability of the officers and crew which made possible what was without doubt the most re markable voyage ever made by an ironclad vessel in an emergency. Captain Whiting's report, which reached the Navy Department through Admiral Dewey, contains details of his trip. He especially commends the alertness of the Monadnock's executive officer. Lieutenant Commander C. P. Perkins; Chief Engineer T. F. Burg dorff, who "stubbornly fought the in herent weakness of engines designed for harbor use, and successfully forced them through a prolonged voy age at sea," and Surgeon M. D. Steele, who carried the ship's company through the trying ordeal without a single fatality, though men were con tinually falling from heat and exhaus tion. Speaking of the zealous responses of the officers and men to unusual calls for duty, Captain Whiting says: "They volunteered by delegation to coal the ship day and night at Guam, although nearly prostrated by the heat and confinement to which they were subjected, both there and while en route. Too much praise cannot Joe given the engineer force below, who have been Incessantly occupied, at times under the most arduoas circum stances that can be imagined on board ship in the tropics, doing their utmost to keep the machinery in running or der. "That I have succeeded in safely bringing this monitor so far from her intended field of action in such a com paratively short time with the Nero for a consort, is wholly and entirely due to the most patriotic and ener getic support of this ship's company of officers and men. There is no bet ter ship's company afloat, and all who can show upon their records that they took part in the cruise of the Monad nock from San Francisco to Manila during the war with Spain deserve all the favors that the Navy Department and a grateful country can bestow* up on them either now or in the future." IN THE PHILIPPINES. Aguinaldo Recognizes the Import ance of a Protectorate. MANILA. Dec. 7.—The native press continues to advocate independence and reimbursement to the United States of the amount to be paid Spain for the Philippines. The "Independencia" thinks this course the only just one. It insists that the Filipinos have aided the Americans, solely because they be lieved they were fighting for independ ence. The paper quotes liberally from President McKinley's last speech in Chicago to support its contention that the Americans are pledged to give the Filipinos independence* and his principal advisers fully recognize the importance of a strong protectorate in some form. One of the latter has even ventured the as sertion that if the Filipinos, were grant ed independence in accordance with the demands of the leaders the Americans would be asked to establish a protec torate, as otherwise the Philippines must sooner or late become the prey of a less liberal-minded country. This statement is borne out by the attitude of the better class of Filipinos in the vicinity of Manila, The numer ous stories as to hostility felt and dis played on their part toward the Ameri cans are without foundation. The Unit ed States authorities expect on the part of the natives a peaceful accept ance of the inevitable. The United States transport Newport, bearing General Miller and staff and the First Battalion, Twentieth Kansas Regiment, with the Wyoming Light Battery, which left San Francisco No vember Bth, arrived to-day, closely fol lowing the City of Puebla, which ar rived yesterday with Lieutenant Colonel Childers, twenty-five officers and GOO men, including five companies of the First Tennessee, Troop' A of the Nevada Volunteer Cavalry, a detachment of re cruits for the Twenty-third Infantry and a detachment* of the California Heavy Artillery. To provide for the accommodation of these newcomers will necessitate the transfer of a number of United States troops outside the city limits proper. 

THREE MEN PERISH. Buried Under Thousands of Tons of Burning Coal. WEST SUPERIOR (Wis.). Dec. 7.— While fighting a fire in the dock of the Lehigh Coal and Coke Company to-day a crew of men were caught by a bad cave-in, caused by the weakening of the pile foundation. Four were buried under thousands of tons of burning coal. One, John Waski, has been res cued alive, but is in a serious condi tion. The other three have probably perished. Their identity cannot be learned, as they were new men. The fire is the worst which has been experienced here for years. The middle of the dock is burning fiercely. Farmers* National Congress.

WASHINGTON, Dec. . 7.—Tne War investigating Commission examined several witnesses to-day, including Pay master General Stanton and Colonel Hecker, Quartermaster in charge of transportation of the troops. Paymaster General Stanton testified that orders and requests were given him from those in command of the forces asking that the pay of the vol unteers be deferred until they should return to the United States, that being believed to be the wisest and most ju dicious course. Pay was withheld in Cuba on the order of Major General Miles, he thought, and from the troops in Porto Rico on the orders or requests of several commanders. Colonel Hecker, who has just re turned from Cuba, was examined in detail as to the charters and purchases of vessels by the War Department. He said between June 20th and July 25th he purchased seventeen vessels on the authority of the Secretary of War. He found 90 per cent, of the vessels offered wholly unsuited. Colonel Hecker said in his negotia tions he dealt directly with the owners of the vessels wherever possible. He knew of no instance where more than the actual cost price was paid for ves sels. He always, he said, got lower than the asking price. Queried as to railway contracts, he interjected that it was not he, but the railways, that "controlled the rates," as they charged more than they ought to have received. He referred to the transportation rates between Chicka mauga and Newport News; and said better rates had been obtained by let ting these contracts in this city, the tariff having been reduced from $13 to $8 per man for the same service. Colonel Hecker made an emphatic denial that there was any "influence" in "routing" the troops on the several lines. Colonel Alden, Assistant Surgeon General, said he did not know why it was that only officers who "hustled" were able to get medical supplies for their men. Monson's Speech Denounced. PARIS, Dec. 7.—The Paris newspa pers to-day denounce the speech deliv ered last evening by the British Em bassador, Sir Edmund Monson, at the annual meeting of the British Cham ber of Commerce here, as being a com mentary and warning in the most of fensive form. , They say the French Embassador at London, M. Paul Cam bon, will certainly be instructed to ask the Marquis of Salisbury whether it is by his orders that Sir Edmund under takes to direct France's foreign policy. Manley Will Not Return. NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—Alexander L. Manley, the, colored editor who was compelled to leave Wilmington, N.

Circuit Court. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7—There was filed in the United States Circuit Court to-day an important mining suit involving property worth over $3,000, --000. The disputed lands are located in Tuolumne and Mariposa Counties. The Merced Gold Mining Company, a Montana corporation, is the complain ant. The accerdited respondents are David Dorward, C. M. Babney and Daniel Corcoran of Coulterville, Mari posa County, and they appear as repre sentatives of the Rosenfelds and other San Francisco capitalists. Judge Morrow at once issued a re straining order, binding on the respond ents until the case is tried on its merits. The Merced Gold Mining Com pany is, it is understood, one of the corporate names of the Bigelow\ syndi cate of Boston, which is the owner of the Calumet and Hecla mine and the Boston and Montana Company, the great rival of the Anaconda propertie3 in Montana The Merced Company owns over thirty mining claims near Coulterville. When the claims were purchased the company also bought a ditch forty-five miles long from the south fork of the Tuolumne, in that county, to Horeston Bend, in Mariposa County, together with water rights andthe -right to the water of the south fork of the Tuolumne River. For a time the company used steam power to work its claims, and the re spondents, alleging that they consid ered that the ditch and its water rights had been abandoned, filed new loca tions, hence the present litigation, for with water rights and the right to the the claims of the Merced Company would be P rw c fr lfi9bl 1 y valueless. 

AMERICAN TRADE IN CHINA. Phenomenal Strides Were Made During the Past Year. Importations From United States at Chee Foo Equal All Europe. Tke Value of Imports at Tkat Port Specified as American Almost Ten Times Greater Tkan Tkose From Great Britain—lnterest ing Report to tke State Depart ment Made by Consul General Sowles. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. — W r ith a good deal of pride Consul General Sowles, at Chee Foo, calls the atten tion of the State Department to the phenomenal strides made by Ameri can trade in that section of China in the past year. He says that when the books for 1898 are closed the value of American merchandise imported there will lead all others. It will possibly equal or exceed the values for all Europe. The American flour imports for six months of this year were $41,393, which were almost as large as the value of the imports of flour for the whole four years preceding. American ginseng also made its first appearance as an article of import, which the Consul re gards as remarkable. In the case of drills, the imports for the first six months of this year ex ceeded those of the entire years of 1893 and 1894, and the imports of all years of 1897 were four times as large as they were in 1593. The value of imports into Chee Foo in 1897 specified as American were al most ten times greater than those specified as from Great Britain. The Consul points to the interesting fact that the value of the American imports into the single Chinese port of Chee Foo exceeds the entire value of our exports to any one of forty-one separate countries which he names. Including in the lists such nations as Guatemala, Peru. Dutch East Indies, Portugal and Switzerland, and in the Consul's opinion not more than twenty of the eighty-six political divisions of the world's commerce would show a greater value of our exports than this Chinese port of Chee Foo. He said it is also true that the value of American exports to three North China ports, Tien Tsin, Niuch Wang and Chee Foo, last year exceeded our combined sales to all the Central American States, while we sold more cotton goods in Chee Foo than we sold in all Europe. DEATH OF LILLIAN BRANDES. Preliminary Hearing of the Father on a Charge of Murder. OAKLAND, Dec. 7—The preliminary hearing in the case of W. A. Brandes, accused of the murder of his thirteen year-old daughter, Lillian, has already occupied nearly a week before Judge Clift. A great deal of circumstantial evidence has been offered, and on cir cumstantial evidence the case must be decided. James S. Hardy, ex-capitalist, who boarded at the Brandes house, has been regarded as a witness friendly to the prisoner, but to-day he testified to his belief that the child had been mur dered. Mrs. Mary Arellanes Brandes, mother of Lillian and first wife of Brandes, will testify to-morrow about her ex husband's cruelty. She left her husband several years ago, and the prosecution alleges that there was no divorce, and that if Brandes has been married to his present wife he is a bigamist. Ramon Anon of Santa Cruz, cousin of Lillian, will testify that when Brandes went to Santa Cruz about a year ago for the purpose of taking his daughter to Berkeley, he said that he would kill Lillian if she did not behave when at home. A 

SUPERVISOR INDICTED. Charged by the Grand Jury With Accepting a Bribe. FRESNO, Dec. 7.—The Grand Jury of this county to-day brought in an in dictment against Supervisor Charles W. Garrett, charging him with receiv ing a bribe of $150 from James K. Hop kins, president of the Hopkins Agricul tural Works. The circumstances of the transaction are alleged to be as follows: In the latter part of last July the county bought a road sprinkler for Garrett's district, the price being $900. The pur chase was made through Garrett, and in consideration of $150 to be paid to him by Hopkins he bought the sprinkler from the Hopkins Agricultural Works. Garrett claims that the money he re ceived from Hopkins was merely a loan, and declares that he has already re turned $40 of the same. Hopkins has not yet been indicted, but will be to morrow. It is reported that another Supervisor will be indicted to-morrow on a similar charge growing out of a transaction al most identical with that in which Gar rett was involved.
