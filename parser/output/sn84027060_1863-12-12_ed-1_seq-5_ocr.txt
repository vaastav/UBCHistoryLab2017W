If the Leg islature of Missouri adjourned without electing a Senator, the appointment of the gentlemen held good until the proper as sembly of the Legislature, and the election by that body.

What the Richmond Whig Says. NEW YORK, Dec. 8.—The Richmond Whig of the 3d has the lellowing stern facts: With no other motive or thought than to advance the public interests, we would again suggest to the President the advantage of reorganizing his Cabinet and calling to his aid the very ablest intel ligence of the country. We have a Treas ury Department that has failed to keep its'finances trom ruin. The business of all Departments show the want of a more masterly hand. There is nothing the Pres ident MU do which will give more satisfac tion than that of calling to his aid as his advisers a Cabinet of the best intellect now in the country, regardless of what may Lave been their former politics. The peo- Eis le arc anxiously expecting a change. For own continuance and future usefulness and fame, as well as on account of tbe con dition of the county, we sincerely present this recommendation.

A Union Yolce firom Llhhy Prison. —Appeal flrom a Captured Illi nois Officer. LIBBY PRISON, RICHMOND, \a.—Editor Chicago Evening Journal: Of what are our people thinking, that the thinned rank* of our regiments are not filled up at once, and our Generals furnished with plenty of men to push this rotten and tottering rebel lion to the wall? True, we have more men now In the field than the rebels, and per haps enough to eventually defeat ana de stroy their armies. But why, with our millions of men and unbounded resources, should we wait for our veteran soldiers to contend with and gradually conquer ar mies nearly as strong as their own, when we have the ability to hurl such an ava lanche of men upon them as shall in one short winter's campaign drive their lead ers from the land, and their soldiers into submission to the Constitution and laws o the country? These, Mr. Editor, are ques tions which we prisoness—as we lay here month after month, wearing out our lives in these wretched prisons—ask ourselves daily. It may be said that it is too late now to operate in the field this winter.— Let me say I was in the field last winter, and I would ask for no better weather for field operations than we had in December and January in Tennessee and Mississippi. It is a mistake to suppose that armies can not operate in this country in the winter.— I know by experience that the open field is a much better place for a soldier, both as regards his comfort, his health and fare, than the best of the rebel prisons. I have now been here four months, and there has not been a time during those months but what an army of 300.000 men— or less—well commanded, could have land ed on the York river, moved over the pen insula, taken Richmond, and held it. This statement is not made unadvisedly. It is objected that Lee would prevent any such movement on the Peninsula. Could we and anything better than that Lee could be drawn from nis present strongholds, if that could be done without reducing the present strength of Meade's army? Illinois can throw into the field—without the least detriment to her agricultural, manufacturing or commercial interests— 10,000 men within the next thirty days.— No man who is worthy of the proud name of Illinoisan will deny this. Other States doing their duty, the first day of January next would see our armies increased by 300,000 men. With this Increase to our ar mies, our Generals would, ere the bad roads of February and March interfered with active operations, garrison Richmond and every principal city in the rebel States and rescue the 12,000 prisoners now laying idle in their prisons. Another and a great reason why our people should flock to the standard now and overwhelm this insur rection is. that these 12,000 prisoners are many of them suffering for food. I speak, now of the privates, for the officers are re ceiving provisions by the- boat lead from our loved ones at home, and as long as we are so supclied, can bear our 6lose confine ment in these filthy dens as long as the good of our cause demands it. But these privates, brave fellows who have left homes of comfort and plenty, the loving care of gentle wife or anxious mother and the sun ny smiles of happy little ones, to bear the privations and hardships of the camp and march, and brave the awful thunders of the rebel cannon, are many of them this day starving slowly to death. Can any well-fed alderman, merchant or banker, of Chicago, sit down with a good appetite to his sirloin of beef and its rich accompaniments, and think of this fact f— Can any farmer in Illinois enjoy the food with which his well-heaped board is sup plied, while he sees in his mind's eye ms neighbor's son, his nephew, or perchance his own brave boy, standing on that filthy spot, misnamed "Belle" Island, with his tattered shirt, his soleless shoes and unshel tered heud, eagerly watching the gate of his den for the approach of his breikfast. And there he watches until the last tints of the golden "Iniian summer" evening are giving way to the raw chilling W 'nd of a November night, when the gate oi ens and a file of slovenly negroes, carrying dirty wooden buckets, filled with cold boiled rice, come in. He gets one pint of this for his breakfast, dinner, supper, his all of food for twenty-four hours. I do not pre tend that this happens every d*y, but it happens. And when this is not t&^portion, the moiety of bread of unsifted corn, meal and tough poor beef is no great improve ment. O God! can any man who can carry a musket, ride a horse or wield a sabre, sit at home quietly and know these things. I hope not. Let the cry go forth, let it roll over every prairie and snake every hill top in the West, "To arms! to arms! a rescue! a rescue!!" until our brave boys are deliv ered from their semi-barharous captors, .who are murdering them by the slow tor ture of starvation. 

OEROLD. A characteristic storv of the President is narrated in a letter from Washington.— When the telegram from Cumbberland Gap reached Mr. Linooln that ''firing was heard in the direction of Knoxville," he remarked that he was "glad of it." Some person present, who had tbe perils of Burn side's position uppermost in his mind, oould not see why Mr. Linooln should be "glad of it," and so expressed himself.— "Why, you see," responded the President, "it reminds me of Mistress 8allie Ward, a neighbor of mine, who had a very large family. Occasionally one of her numerous progeny would be beard crying in some out-of-the-way place, upon which Mistress Sallie would exclaim, "There's one of my children that isn't dead yet!"
