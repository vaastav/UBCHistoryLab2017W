A Battle Expectcd. Nsw YOEK, NOV. 29.—Tbe nrmy correspon dent of the Philadelphia Enquirer from, Aquia Creek, says: Daily, hourly, in fact, momentari ly, we expect to bear the first gun fired that will inaugurate the first grand battle of this cam paign, for it is in this vicinity that not only al most tbe entire rebel army is concentrated, 100, 000 strong, but also the three grand divisions which go to make np the grand army of tbe Po tomac. A dispatch to the Philadelphia Press lavs that lsst night the indications were that Gen. Burn side's army wonld soon move, and that we are on the eve of one of tbe greatest battles of modern times. From Zffcmphla. CAIRO, Dec. 1.—Memphis is much excited in consequence of construction put upon General Grant's general order, not understood to mean that before any thing can be bought to either eat or wear, purchasers must take an oath of allegiance. It goes into effect tbe 16th ot De cember. A report is currant in Memphis that German town was burned by some soldiers belonging to the 8th Missouri, while Gen. Sherman's division was near that town, and that Gen. Smith had, the offenders arrested and shot All the teams in the country passed over by Gen. Sherman's army 'have been pressed into transportation service. On Friday night, near President's Island, tbe steamer Black Hawk, from Memphis to Helena, coll'ded with the up*hpund boat White Cloud? The Black Hawk was badly damaged, and after floating some distance, sank. Three negroes were lost, and the rest on board escaped. She was valned at $6,000 and ia a total loss to the owner. There is a band of organized robbers on the roads leading from Memphis. On tbe,28th tbey robbed citizen Elijah Brooks of $1100, General Sherman, at last accounts, was be yond Cold Water.

HIADQB'S A KMT or TBI POTOMAC,) November 80 Considerable excitement is occasioned by the circulation of a report here that a proposition has been made by the rebels for an armistice of SO days, and that Lee was already in Waahing ton arranging terms for the agreement No credence is put in this rumor, however. The Rebels are working with redoubled ener gy in their fortifications and their cavalry bfve of late been very active and have captured nu merous of our pickets along the fords of tbe river, besides the two companies of tbe TMfd Pennsylvania cavalry at Harwood Church. Longstreet commands the right snd Hill the left of the rebel force confronting us. Deserters coming within our lines report that large bodies of their forces have been detached and eent off either to Richmond or to reinforce Stonewall Jackson. These reports must be re ceived with great caution, however. Our oavalry have captured numbers of rebels along the river below this place. Special* to the New York Paper* The Herald's special, dated Fairfax, Dec. 1, says the expedition under Gen. Stabl, is undoubt edly one of tbe most brilliant and successful af fairs of tbe war, both in id conception and exe cution. IU principal object was to ascertain the whereabouU of Stonewall Jackson, and what forces were on the right—this, and more was accomplished. Jackson, with both tbe Hills, passed through New Market last Wednesday, on his way soutb, and it is presumed he bss gone to intercept Gen. Cox's advance. Prisoners captured by Stabl report that White tbe leader of White's cavalry, was twioe wound ed in a skirmish st Berryville. NEW YOKK, Dec. 2.—The Times' Falmouth tpecial sutes that two deserters from the rebels report their foree at 75,090 to 76,000, certain ly not exceeding the latter. Though Buffering for clothing and many kinds of aupplies, tbey are still apparently hopeful of final success, and Lee and Ashby are puzzled over the move menu of tbe enemy, which they do not seem fully to comprehend and have finally concluded the advance upon Fredericksbutgb, a feint de signed to amuse them while the main atuck upon Richmond is to come from another quar. ter. Upon this theory they now believe our foroes in front of Fredericksburgh in reality to be small and that immenae hosts sre being em barked at Bell Plain and conveyed in transports up James river. Acting upon this ides they have commenced erecting earthworks for the protection of a garrison force, while the main body of their army commence moving ttflrarda Richmond. Nxw YOKE, Dec. 2.—A special despatch is as follows: OrrosiTt FsiDBtiOKsnrao, Nov. 80.—The reb els atill continue to fortify vigorously on tbel^ second line. It is now believed their infantry force has been sent farther to tbe rear, where their camp fires are not so viaible. Instead of evacuating their position, as spoken of in yester days's dispatch, it ia believed in official quarters that the rebel force about Fredericksburg, snd within call, is from 100,000 to 126,000. No aupplies of vegetables have yet been dis tributed, though promised sevsral days ago.— Billions diseases and symptoms of scurvy grew worse. Revelatfoa to the "World.** Niv YOKK, Dec. 2.—The World says Burnaide ,is removed, and Hooker appointed. 'a lYM-iT fcuaua WABW6T0N, Dec. 2—The Ster has the fol lowing Tbe War Department has arrested Mr. Spaul ding, of tbe 60tb New York Engineers, volun teer, and the other officers who were with him In tbe recent transportation of the pontoon train from this point to fUmOudh, Vs.

Part of the cargo of the steamer Sbelton was sold to day, bringing over $100,000. W .. The Address nf Parson Rrownlow at Nashville. We have published Parson Brownlow's re* marks at bis reception in Nssbville on Thurs day nigbt On Friday evening he delivered an address st McKendree Chapel, in that city, be fore a crowded audience, in which he set forth more at length bis views of political and na tional matters, and his intentions in regard to the promotion of lojal Methodism at the South. We make a few extracU: SLAVXRT ASD ITS FKOSFECTS. I have canvassed every Eastern and most of the Northwestern SuteB for tbs lsst eight months, and while I have changed no opinion, I mast say that the North never contemplated in terfering with Southern institutions. I think now, in consequence of the criminal conduct of the Sooth, that slavery is pretty well played out, and the Soutb may thank herself for it If her negroes are emancipated oi run off, it will be a righteous retribution. ABOLITIONISTS ROT TOE CAU8I OF TBI REBELLION— BUCHANAN. As I have said at tbe North, before not less than five hundred thousand, I say here, this re bellion is not the work of Abolitionists, but of God forsaken Southern demagogues. I have al ways been a pi o slavery man, and apposed to Abolitionism, but must Bav that this rebellion is not tbe work of Abolitionists, but of a corrupt South. The Government, under iu present form, has existed nearly eighty yearq^ During this period we have held nineteen Presidential elections, in which the Soutb, with bat half tbe States, population and electoral votes which tbe North has, elected thirteen PresidenU and the North has elected six. The Sooth re elected five of ber Presidents, who held the Govern ment forty years, while Bbe made it a point to allow no Northern President to be re elected.— Not satisfied with this, she seized, appropriated, kidnapped, and used as cats paws one half of tbe Northern Presidents. The last we appro priated, soul, body and breeches, was Buchanan —that miserable old public functionary. I am not here to reproach any one—I have joined the unconditional Union party, to put down tbe re bellion at any required cost—but still I hope the ladies will rebuke their husbands and sweet hearts who voted for that wretched oid creature —since any man who can live in this sin-strick en world for eighty yeara without either court ing a woman or wedding a wife, is fit for wolf bait 

JXVAL MSTBOB1BTS TO BAVS TBS SOCTBSBS PCB- L1SHINO BOUSB. I intend to call a Conference of the local preachers, and we will expel the last devil of these rebel priests. We will put tbese seceders and rebels out, and recover the church property which rightfully belongs to us, and not to the traitors. This Methodist Book Concern in your city, which has published so much treason, is not tbe property of tbe rebels. It belongs to the loyal Methodists, and we mean to have it back. Here is a copy of tbe Church Discipline, and it most positively enjoins upon all our preach ers obedience to tbe laws and constituted au thorities of the Isnd. A transgression of this injunction makes the defendant liable to expul sion from tbe cburcb. When the eldera are ordained they are brought around the altar (you have seen tbe ordinations here frequently, for all the eldera were prdained here, as this was an aristocrstio congregation, a bon ton, upper tendom cburcb), and there, in the presence of God and the congregation, tbe bishop lays his hands upon their heads, and swears them to oppoae all disloyal doctrinea.— Thus these rebel preachers are perjured—foully, basely, wickedly perjured. Esrly, when he was ordsined a Bishop, took an oath to promote peaoe and harmony, law and order. I beard him swear the lie myself in Columbus, Georgia. Par son Sawrte, who knows him well, in some private transactions, says that Early is a miserably cor rupt old creature. Let us believe these rebels always when tbey Ustify against one another I When tbe villainy of these wretches shall be exposed, tbe revelation will shock the country. These Southern Methodist preschers began the work of disunion years sgo. John C. Calhoun, the arch-originator of treason, sent for Bishop Capers, and had a long private conference with him at tbe time the split occurred in oar Ghurch. This was the entering wedge of dissnion. I mesn to show tbese traitors to the scorn and abhor rence of their countrymen. Tbe Dakota Republican of the 16th instsnt says: "On Saturday, tbe first instant, a squad of tbe Dakota Cavalry, ten in number, under Captain Miner, left Yancton for Sioux Falla City, aa an escort to a party who waa going there to remove tome mill-stones While at or near tbe Falla, a party of about thirty Indians made their ap pearaoca, whereupon Captain Miner went to them for tbie purpose of "having a talk," and learning their sentiments. From tbe reports we have received, it would seem that not liking the appearsnce of thlngfyhe. fired his revolver into the air, as a signal for his men to come to bim, which tbey did but upon neiriog tbe Indians tbey were greeted with a round from their guns Now commenced a little sharp work, which re sulted in the routing of tbe Indians, with a loss of one killed and several wounded. The Caval ry got nttjr scratch, sll coming but unharmed. TOe Indian who was killed wss ssld to hsve been s chief, which will probsbly account for tbe skedaddle of the rest He fought bravely, dubbing bis gun snd using It as s weapon of de fence.

The people of Preitonville, Ky., the most rsbid seoesh in the State, tors down tbe Union flsg sbont s year sgo, snd put up s Confeder ate flag in its place, and declared that another Union flag should norer float in that town wain. Col. Isaac P.

They legged hard t* have a flag furnished them, but the Colonel stid "No, you tore down die Union flag, and you shall replace it If you do it voluntarily, all right if not, I wUl drive you together sad compel you to do it" Whan Saturday morning came it was floating in thebreeto. 1 I •Ol««t 1'JMi £3*1*? 3 ,i 'l1 8'KrtS^ -fcf WJ "JijSW t'iiT Jlu- -OA4«ij is-jiJi v» .ivl ftisuO ,' :Z9 «ei 8pedal Oorrcspondtnce sf tbe Chicago Tinea. 1MB SKIfWiaSIPPI RIVBR EXPRJDI- TION. itfetu af the movement* dee* CAISO, HI., Nov. 29. The mighty preparations making at this and other points for ths campaign sgsinst Vieksburg seem to monopolise public nttentioo, st lesst in ths Northwest, to the exclusion ot sll other mat ters Thus the movement from Helens a week or two sinoe, designed to get possession of tbe White River as a base of future operations, but which failed most ignomialously siftply from the lack of brains at its head, waa scarcely noticed. Sherman's advance from Memphis, with a power fol force, has eluded publicity simply because of lack of public interest in tbe movement— Even the advance of the Grand Army of Gen. Grant from La Grange oauaes no psrticnlar sen sation, notwithstanding tbe prevalent opinion that he will have a grand battle with tbe rebels under Pemberton ere many days. Public interest now centres with tbe long promised grand move ment directly Down TBI HI8Sl83tm. It makes no difference that the movements mentioned are auxiliary to the great one designed to open the Mississippi throughout its length, the people want to see the direct movement There is a wide-spread, deep, and absorbing in terest throughout the great Northwest in the campaign now opening, and it is but natsral that the flower of the Northwest is embarked in this enterprise, but also that the Northwest is, in a measure, blockaded, and this is an effort to break that blockade. The Mississippi River is, and always has been, tbe natural highway over which the surplus products of a great portion dt that undefined territory commonly known as the Northwest find their way to market The rail roads leading from this territory to the seaboard are totally inadequate to the transportation of these marvelously vast surplus stores. This has been fully demonstrated during the past two fractional seasons. The great trunk lines of railroad that, since 1866, have none ol them been able to earn a dividend, however small, have suddenly found their earnings exceeding all precedent, their lines blocked up by the supera bundant freight, more business ofiering than they can possibly dispose of, and their treasuries be coming so full as to necessitate dividends. And while the railroads have thus grown rich, the people have become impoverished. It is a sin gular spectacle to Bee a vast population literally struggling with poverty in the midst of a plenty of all tbe staples of life such as the world never saw. Yet this is the condition of the farming population of the grest Northwest And why is it? Simply because their highway to market is blockaded. The railroads can give them no re ief. The cost ol transportation for a bushel of corn from Central oi* Southern Illinois to New York or Boston is nearly as much as the corn is worth after it has reached its maiket Heie» it is that occasionally the sight is presented, on the beautiful and productive prairies of Illi nois, of corn used for fuel. It is not worth send ing to market the farmer has more than he can use himself fuel cosu bim money which he has not, while his cribs are groaning with the golden cereal, which, while it will not briag money, will burn. Why should it not be consumed? It is because of this state of affairs,—because the capacity of the Mississippi is unlimited, and with its free navigation tbe cofti and wheat of Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Mis souri can reach a profitable market, and be made to remunerate the grower for his time and labor spent in its production,—that the people of the Great Northwest manifest a deep interest in all movements looking to and promising tbe speedy le-opening of this great thoroughfare. TBS HIVSB OPEN TO VICK8BDBO Through the operations of the Mississippi squadron, under the efficient and energetic com* mand of Acting Rear Admiral Porter, guerrilla parties along tbe river, hence to tbe farthest point below here occupied by our forces, have been effectually squelched. It is a fact, not yet fully appreciated, that from Cairo to tbe moutb of the Yazoo River tbe merchant steamer can navigate the stream with as much safety as sim ilar craft may cross the gieat Lakes. This was not the case a month ago but since then there baa been a change. A month ago the river waa unsafe for all but armed vessels anywhere below Columbua. Some wholesome lessons bave been taught the vagabond freebooters of the South, alias, guerrillas, alias partisan rangers, which bave resulted in their complete withdrawal from the river. And to-day cotton buyers are indus triously engaged in hunting out tbe precious fibre three hundred m^les below Helena. This is a single result of the vigorous policy of tbe present commander of naval operations here. 

BBBZL FOS1TIOBS OS TBI UVXB. Thus, then, tbe river is open, and its naviga tion undisputed to loyal merchantmen, as far down as the moutb of tbe Yasoo, or say three fourths of tbe way to New Orleana Just be low tbe moutb of the Yszoo, at Vicksbcrg, we have good reason to know the rebels have some rather formidable batteries, which have hitherto been sufficient to withstand oar assaults We also know tbat but a abort distance above New Orleans tbey bave blockaded tbe river in a sim ilar manner. So that between Vieksburg and New Orleans tbe river is in possession of the rebels At several points between tbese two plaees tbey are said to bave erected batteriee of a more or leas formidable character. One at Port Hudson, a abort distance above Baton Rouge, on toe Mississippi side of tbe river, is reported as particularly strong, rivaling even Vieksburg in iu impregnability. Thus we bave a stretch of river, four hundred miles in leogth, and strongly fortified both at its extremities and at various pointa throughout its length, which must be wrested from the possession of the re bels before the Great NoKhwest will be relieved from this oppressive blockade and bave their vested right of the free navigation ol the Mis sissippi restored to them. To accomplish this is the work of the winter campaign now about opening. Those who fancy it is to be sn essy task have willfully closed their eyes to die wholesome lessons this war has already taught MSTAXXS or TBS PAST. The rebels at one time, under a mighty pros sure of adverse circumstances^ were prepared to surrender tbe entire river to our possession.— When their strongholds above Memphis were wrested from them, one after the other, and the victorious fleet of Admiral Farragut bad forced the surrender of the mouth of tbe river, tbey no longer entertsined s thought of disputing the Federal possession. We then hsd only to enter snd-oooupy. It was the most destaging blow the rebellion had received, but one which tbey were inrootent to avert It cot them off from their #£at soirees of sspplies in Arkansas and Texas, and threatened them with stsrvstion.— Yet, as I have said, they resolved to abandon the river and trust to luck in prolonging the war inland. But unfortunately we made mis takes and did not enter and occupy the field abandoned to us. It Is folly to recall tbe record of past follies to account for the failures we bave made. Farragut** fleet ascended tbe river to Tlcksbnrg, and Davis' descended to the same point Bither fleet alone eould have laid Vieks burg in raiaaaad left not one stone of It upon -EYE. if .1 [JUNE, 1839 soother. But pa fort? By a singular coinci dence of managerial folly neither float wss ac companied by s land force for tbe oooupation of the place after its batteries should be siletieed* so after waiting till weeks numbered monthal looking for an army that had never been order ed there, and submitting to the extreme mortifi cation of being bsffled by a little nondescript craft that should have been sunk aa it eould have been, both fleete turned about and betook themselves swsy, sbandoning the attempt I have reeon to know that it wae no part of the rebel plan to make a protracted defence of Vieksburg but when their ability to hold it was thus practically demonstrated they aban doned the purpose of surrendering it, as they naturally would. uraussD Fosmoss or TBS srarr. Hsviug thus succeeded in holding a conspicu ous and important point, to their own grest sur prise, the rebels determined to repossess other points tbst tbe result showed they bad too haft* tily and easily surrendered. Thus they reoocu pied point after point along down the river un til this stretch of four buodred miles, above al luded to, came wholly into their possession.— What they thus recovered they took pains to put in condition to bold. Tbey have been far from idle during tbe fall, as we shall learn ere we recover this territory, which wss onoe ours simply by the taking. They will obstinately defend every inch of the river tbey now hold, and we shall witness more than one desperate struggle before we shall be permitted to load our corn and wheat at St. Louis and Cairo and see it safely transported to New Orleans. rLAB or TR APPROACHING CAMPAIGN. Having thus hastily sketched tbe purposes and nature of this campaign I approach a somewhat more delicate subject in speaking of the plan of campaign. With tbe doors of the military prison at Alton staring me in tbe hce, I do not propose entering idto any detailed exposition of the movements contemplated to be made in prosecu ting the arduous duty devolving on our military and naval officers. But a certain drgree'of pub licity has obtained in regard to this' move ment, which, to some extent, removes the pledge of secrecy which correspondents are supposed tacitly to give in regard to such matters. And then, as the movement is well known to the re bels, and hss furnished their journalists with nu merous texts for articles of an apprehensive na ture, I may be allowed to discuss the subject in a general way. THS ABUT ABD SAVT TO IFOVX TOGBTBSS. First, then, tbe folly will not be repeated of attempting the reduction of a fortified'city with a naval force alone. The besieging squadron will be accompanied by a suitable land force, to co-operate, if need be, in assaulting the enemy's positions, and to occupy and bold whatever points may thus be taken. What the strength of this force is to be 1 do not know. Large numbers ot tbe new levy of troops from Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa bave passed down the river to Memphis, and I have heard it stated they were to join this expedition. General Steele's eorps of Curtis' army baa been trans ported from Southeastern Missouri to Helena, and I have seen the statemenU in newspapers that tbey were to join the expedition. A por tion of Gen. G. P. Morgan's command, the he roes of Cumberland Gap, have gone to Memphis as the Cincinnati papers say, for the same pur pose. Thus it will be seen that, if all the troops popular rumor and the newspapers assign to this expedition are really assigned to it, it will bo one of truly formidsble dimensions, embracing hardy veterans of many well-fought battles, ana ambitious fresh recruits, honorsbly emulous of tbe bard-earned and glittering laurels of their older companions in arms. Such a composition is precisely adapted to accomplish glorious deeds. Tbe true road to scccess with the sol dier is through emulation. As there is no vital ity in ordinary commercial affairs without com petition, so there is no success iu military affairs without emulation. Then, too, it will be no ticed tbat all tbese troops sre drawn from the Great Northwest—the region of all others moot interested in the success of tbe undertaking.— Every man will bave a personal, appreciable in* terest at stake. Every man will fight, therefore, not merely as the loyal soldier struggling for the supremacy of bis flag, but also as a citizen whose vested rights bave been invaded, and who to recover tbat which hss been wrongfully taken from him. TBI UILITABT COHMASDBR. Then as to the military commaoder of the ex pedition I am equally at fault. Rumor has de volved this important trust upon Major General John A. McClernand. Should this really be the selection Illinois ought to be proud of tbe dis tinction thus conferred upon her in the selection of one of her bravest sons to command so impor tant a movement. McClernand is a brave as the record of Belmont, Fort Henry, Donelson. and Shiloh will amply testify. I had the honor of standing by his side on that memorable Sat* urday morning at Donelson when the thunders ofaitillery awoke the weary soldiers from their scanty repose in the open air, with blankets of snow for their covering. I stood beside him during four long hours throughout which ths storm of lead and iron falling about us was like hailstones in an early summer's storm. I saw bis smile of couwmpt as the missiles of the ea emy glanced all about bim, and to this day I bave never suffered myself to lose possession of a cannon ball tbat grazed McClernand*s leg and barely escaped me. It is tbe relic of tbe war I prise most highly, aa suggesting with what un flinching courage a true so.'dier, like McClero and, can face tne iron storm. But there ate other things to be considered la the selection of a commander for such a move ment ai title than mere personal bravery. Thank God, this war has developed a boat of brave men. We cannot well go amiss in the selection of our commanders if this quality alone is de« sirsble. There is tbs ability to organise sad command.men, which has not been so abund antly developed as personal bravery. And her* let me, as a dose observer, remark that ths quatttj of oommanding doss not consist simply in tbe ability to ssy, go and do eoeha thing.— There mutt be that moral power in the compo sition of the mas oommanding that will enforce obedienoe to tbe command. And, as s—rnlisl to this, there moot be that in the commander that will inspire the oonfideaoe of his command. Such are some of the more conspicuous traits requisite in a good commander aside from per sonal bravery, and aside, too, from tbe ability to mark out the plan of a campaign, snd cause all his varied movements, whether of sucoess or defeat, to work together for the accomplishment of a single grand object I do not undertake to question McClernand's possession of all these qualities, nor do I assert it I merely suggest that they are essentials, and I trust that woo ever is nnallV assign**1 to the command will be fully qualified in all these as in all other re spects. A well informed authority (in the N. Y. 8un) TUggests'that it is part of the Democratic pro* gramme to elect C. Godfrey Gnnther mayor of New York, r*1" Horatio 8eymomr President of the United Ststes in 1886, snd send Fern ando Wood minister to England—Wall: since Monroe Edwards is dead and Huntington the forger is out of public life, perhspe the Domor emtio party cannot do better.
