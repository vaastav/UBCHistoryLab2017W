Friday, December 9,1910 MARYLAND’S BEST CROPS The lecture train, otherwise known as the Farmers’ Institute, that is this week making a pro gressive tour through the counties of Southern Maryland, has been attracting audiences of farmers all along the route, says the Baltimore American. The advice that is being given is generally based upon results that have been actually accomplished. An agri cultural theory is not generally impressive, unless the man with the theory can show that what he says should be accomplished. The lecturers accompanying the “Institute on Wheels” seem tc be of the kind that have been uf against farming difficulties and who are, therefore, competent to talk of the farming situation as it really is. The advice is various when it comes to pointing out the best money-producing crop for the Southern Maryland farmer tc grow. In fact, there is no one “best crop” for Southern Mary land or any other section of the state. Pretty much any one of a dozen (different varieties of farm industry may be made a best money-yielder. There is room for genius and special aptitude in farming, as in every - other art, trade or calling. While Director Hill has been showing that it is good for farm ers of the section to stick to to _■ bacco as the main crop, other lecturers have demonstrated that large profits can be obtained from growing poultry, live stock, fruits, garden vegetables and other foodstuffs. It seems to be generally agreed that a greater variation in the farming industry in the Southern i Maryland counties is practicable and would result in a higher average of farming prosperity. It is generally possible that a half-dozen different kinds of enterprise can be carried for ward on a farm without inter - ference one with another. Farming operations, upon the whole, however, will always be in relative proportion to the — — organizing ability and patient energy of the man who is man aging the enterprise. It is the •man behind the business that counts in farming as in every thing else. PRESIDENT TAFT’S MESSAGE. Among the most important rec- ommendations by President Taft in his second message to Con gress are these: He declares it is time to stop legislating with reference to re gulation of corporations and to - witness the effect of a vigorous execution of the laws already on the statute books. He believes f * the activities of the Government in addition to the enforcement of the laws, should be directed to ward economy of admistration, the enlargement of opportunities for foreign trade and the strengthening of confidence of capital in domestic investment. He strongly recommends some form of ship subsidy to increase American shipping, especially, to South America. He urges commissions for quasi-legislative work, suggest ing commissions of experts to aid Congress and the executive in handling the tariff, rivers and harbors, public buildings and waterways. He defends the Aldrich-Payne tariff bill; says he will make no recommendation of tariff legis lation until the new Congress convenes; urges that the Tariff Board be made permanent, vigorously opposes another gen eral revision, suggesting that future revision be made sched ule by schedule. The Panama canal should by all means be fortified. An ap propriation of $19,000,000 is re commended for this purpose. Toll of $1 per net ton should be charged. There must be no more “pork barrel” methods in river and harbor and public buildings bills. In the past Congress has appro priated too much for buildings i 1 not needed and not enough for | buildings badly needed. ’ Recommendations for anti- and Federal incorpo ration laws are renewed. * It is proposed that second-class mail rates shall be readjusted so * as to charge magazines a much higher rate on their advertising i . sections. - There should be more officers -for the army. The Engineer •t Corps should be increased by 60. Strong representations are i- made for the establishment of a 0 new banking and currency d a system. Two new battleships and - several auxiliary vessels are urged for the navy. A Bureau of Health should be established. He urges the extension of the s civil service principal to the diplo matic and consular corps and the ’ acquisition by the Government s of residences and offices for its a diplomatic officers. s That Congress give some fitting e recognition of the polar dis -3 coveries of Commander Robert y E. Peary is recommended. The n Secretary of the Navy suggests i_ that Peary be made a rear ad y miral and placed on the retired 1 list t * [_ OUR 

WASHINGTON LETTER ® Washington, D. C., December 2,191 C 0 Mr. Editor: P After a recess and an election event d ful in American politics, the national t legislature is again in session in Wash n ington. It will be a full year, however, before the result of the recent elections can be fully felt in legislation, and by t that time there may be such changes t in commercial, industrial and political e conditions that the intention of the g voters as expressed a few weeks ago will be modified or in some instances ® nullified. It is an unfortunate condi * tion that twelve months must elapse g and a session of Congress intervene f before the will of the country as ex- pressed at the polls can be carried in to effect, and when it is remembered 1 that this condition is fixed in the Con- S atitution, that fetish of the American 1 lawyer and statesman, it is difficult to . see how reform mgr be effected. It is expected that the present session will address itself to routine business, 1 the passage of appropriation bills and " necessary non-political measures. The - President’s proclamation has recom r mended as a mat'er of course important j new legislation, but there is little pros , pect of its being carried out. Nothing 1 much will ue done until after the > Christmas holidays, and then barely i two months of the Congressional session will remain before this Congress, i on the 4th of March, will be ex officio, and, as has been said, the new Con ' gress just elected to do and undo so 1 much will not have its chance for twelve 2 months. f Among the measures that will surely have a hearing in the discussions under the appropriation bills will be the sub -1 ject of the fortification of the Panama f Canal and there will be a confusion of - party lines in the debate on this ques . tion. Some Republicans and some Democrats will oppose the military pro gram proposed by the President, while ' other Republicans and Democrats will * approve it. Mr. Tawney, Chairman of ) the Appropriations Committee, who t failed of re-election, will urge that the Canal shall be made a free waterway, unguarded by fortresses or cannon, ■* while those of the Roosevelt and Taft t school of politics will insist that a prop - erty costing nearly half a billion of dollars and essential to the defense of our extensive western coast line shall not be left without adequate military protection, always, of course, “in the interest of peace,” as Mr. Roosevelt . would express it. [. There is much comment in Washing ton with regard to the almost oppres sive silence of Roosvelt since the elec tion. He has completely disappeared ) from the political firmament, and now . instead of headlines and columns on the j first pages of the daily papers, there is not even a paragraph of a caricature. 1 The explanation is that he has probably 1 given a tip to his friends, reporters I and caricaturists (for between him and ; them there has been a loyalty mutual ? and ideal) that they shall give him an indefinite term of exclusive privacy. It would not be bad for Mr. Roosevelt’s political future if he should let his I beard grow, take the Canadian route i to Van Couver, sail on the Express of ? India line to Yokahoma, and spend the next two years in Japan, China, the Philippines, Java, Straits, Settlements ! and India., returning to this country in I time to mix in the next Presidential election, either as principal, or assistant. Travel, -observation, and meditation will be good for even so well equipped a man as the 1 only ex-President of the United States, i It is said that an effort will be made i by the Postmaster General, backed by the administration, to pass a bill re ducing postage on sealed letters to one cent and also to carry into effect the long opposed parcels-post privileges enjoyed by all foreign peoples, but , through the influence of the express companies withheld from the citizens of the United States. The American citizen living in Washington may send a ten pound package by mail to London, Paris, Berlin or Vienna, he cannot send the sario peccage to Baltimore, only one hour distant, or to Philadelphia or New York, four and five hours distant. If the package should weigh only four pounds he can send it by mail for 64 cents to any of these cities, but the I four pounds to the European destina tion costs only 48 cents. The Post, office Department is not responsible for these outrages. They are the re sult of the monopoly which the expiesi companies through their influence in the Senate and House have been ab’e to maintain in the distrbution of pack age by mail. In other words, the ex press companies will not be able to maks so much money if the people of the United States shall insist upon t • having" as good a parcels-post service ! jbetween Phila ielphia and (. incinna'i, j for example, as they have to Berlin or , Paris.
