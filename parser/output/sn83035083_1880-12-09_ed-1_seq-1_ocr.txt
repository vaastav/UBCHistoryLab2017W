We have, however always held ourselves in readiness to aid in accommodating their differences end have at different times reminded both belliger ents of our willingness to -lender such service. Our good offices in this direction were recent ly accepted. by all the belligerents, and is was hoped they would prove efficacious : but I regret to announce that the measures which the Min isters of the United Sates at Santiago aud Lima were autliorind to take, with the view to bring about a peace, were not successful. Iu the course ot the war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights; in all of these the Ministers of the United States have, under their instructions, noted with pioniptness and energy in protection of Americ in interests. The reunons of .ute t uiwa states w th the Empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial. and their commercial intercourse steadily in creases, to their mutual advantage. The internal disorders with which the Argen tine ltepublic has for some time past Itecn af file t til, and which have more or less influenced its external trade, are understood to have b?en brought to a olose. This happy result may bj expected to redound to to the Itcnetit of the foieign commerce of that ltepublic as well as to the development of its vat interior resources In Samoa, the government of King Maiietoa, nnder the support and recognition of t he con sular representatives of the United States, Groat Britain,-and Oeimiuy, seems to have givrn peace and tranquility to the Islands. hWile it does not appear desirable to adopt as a h. 1 5 the scheme of tripartite local government; which has lieen proposed, the common interests of the three great treaty Powers requite har mony in their relation, to the native frame of government, an 1 this may bo best secured by a simple diplou at o- treaty betweeu them, it- would b3 well it tne consular jur.suiction 01 require, an activa development of the wishes and inte- ts of o ir people in tiir t direction.

Ouo in. till measure, however, seems t3 me so clearly useful and eSicicnt that 1 venture to pretsit. npon your os nest atten tion, it seems to be very evincnt that tho pro- vis. on o.r e.utar stAarn-postal c-.rmmunication, by aid from Government, has been the forerun ner of the commercial predominance of Great lr.tain on ail tnee coasts and seas, a ereater snaie in wnoi-e trade is now tlie desire and the inten. of onr people. It is also manifest that tne eiforts of other Eu ropean nations to contend with Great Biitain for a share of this o muierce have been success ful in proportion with their adoption of regular st ram-postai communication with the margets whose ttade they sought. Mexico aud th elites of boutlt Amertca are snxwut to receive such postal communications with this oountry, and t aid in their development. Similar co operation may he locked for, in due time, from ths Eastern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests. In re spect of foreign cemmerce, quite as much as in internal trad ', postal communication seems necessarily a matter of common and public ad ministration, and thus pertaining to govern ment. I respecttullyrecommend to your prompt ateuLioii fcucu just sua .mcient measures as may conduce o the development of onr foreign commercial ex c ranges aud the building up of our carrying t.ade. Iu this connection I desire also to suggest the very great se.yice which migjt be expected in enlarging and lacililattrg our commerce on the I'actnc ocean, were a transmarine oable laid from San Fiaticiscj io the Sandwich Island?, aud thence t Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The great inll uer.C3 of such means 01 communication on these routes of naviga tion, in developing and securing the due share 01 our i-aeino coast in the o mmerce of the world, needs no illustration or enforcement. It may be that suca an enterprise, useful and in the end profitable as it would prove to private investment, may neea to oe hcefa&xi by pru dent legislation by Coug ss in its aid, and I mbmit tho matter to yeur oaie:ui considera tion An additional, and not unimportant, althonr-h secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging t: e navy may b: found in the unquestionable service to tue exr ansir n 'of our commerce. which would be rendered by the freanent cir culation of naval snips in the seas and twirtx nf all quarters of the gloite.

It is fortunate that this la rife surplus revenue occurs at a per od when it may bo directly ap plied to tne payment of the public debt soon to be redeemable. No public duty has been more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as rapid ly ns possible. .' The debt of the United States, less cash in the Tre-snry and eyo'ustve of accruing interest, aittinrd its niaiimuni "of $2, 758,4:. 1,571.4:1 in Au gust. IK.

The annual Saving this secured inoe March I. 1S77. is tl 1.290.153.511. Within a short period over $,'4)0,00 ),000 of 5 and S per cent bonds will become redeemable. This preaelitsa very favorable opportunity not only to runner- rctiuco tne principal or tne debt, out also to reduce tlie rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. 1 call the attention of Con gross to the views expressed on this subject by the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual re port, and recommend prompt legislation, to eutabfethe Treasury Ptcxtartmcnt to complete tne reiunaing ci tne debt wnicn is about to ma-Pure. The continuance of specie payments has not been mierruptcd or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival of business and to our remarkable piospcrity. The fears that preceded and ac companied resumption huveproved groundless. No considerable amount of United States notes have Itcen presei.ted for redemption, while veiy largo sums of gold bullion, both domestic and iuiportiMi.are ta'.ieh to the mints and exchanged for coin or nut 's. The increase of coin and bul lion in the United States since Jan. 1, 1879, is estimated at f'J 7,:i'.9,4.s. The-re are i-till in existence, nneanolled, $34tt,nsi,np; of Pointed States lCHl-teudcr notes. These notes were authorized as a war measure, made necessary by t :e exigencies of the con flict in which the United was then engaged. The preservation of the nation's existence re quired, in the judgment of Concress, an issue of leiral tender paiier money. That it served well the purpose for which it was created is not questioned, but the employment of tho notes as paper money indefinitely, af t-.-rtiie accomplish ment of the object for which they were provided was not coutempl.it si by the f ranters of the law under which they were issued. These notes 1- ng since became like any cither pecuniary o fi ll, a tion to the- -ovcri.ni.iiio a debt to I to paid, and when p dd, to b-s e anetleil a a m-re evi dence of au inilelitiMin-iss no longer exi -ting. I therefore ro( oat what was ta il in the annual lin-ss.-u e of last year, thitt the retirement from circulation of I'uited States notes, with the cu jtacity of leirnl tcmier in private cont acts, is a 1 step to be taLe 1 in our progress toward a tale and stahla currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the eove-nmeat, and the interest and scuuiily of tiic p-eoi le. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing their value and giving them Icgal-toudcr character, it was btlieved by many ot the sup porters of th-: measure that the silver doll ir, which it authorized, would speedily become, under the operations ot the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollir. There were other sup porters of the bill, who, while they donhfrsd as to the probability of this result, neverthi less were willitig to give the proposed experiment a fair trial, with a View to stop the coinage, if ex lK'iieiico should prove that the silver dollar aUiiUoi la'il by t te bill com nine 1 to be of l"ss. couiiin real vali.e than the .-t.tndard gold dol lar. referred to, began in March, 1878, and ha been con tinned as required by th act. The average ratepcr month to the present film has been $S,2W.4W2. Th. total amount coined prior to he first of Kovrabr last was Of this amount $17,0S4,4S0 remain in the treasury, and only f-J,7w.2u are in the hands of the people. A eonstant eelort ha been made to keep this cnrreucvln crrefnlation. and eontildsr- able eipctiso has been necessarily inenmsi for this purpose, but its return to the treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation ot the friends of the measure at the time of its ad. pt Ion. tl. valne of the silver dollar, containing 412 H grains of silver, has not increased. Dnring the year prier to the passage of th bill authorizing it coinage, the market vain of the silver which it contained was from ninety to Binetv-tw cents, as compared with the standard gold doilnr. Dnriag th last year the average market value of tho silver dollar has been eighty-eight and a half cents. It is obvious, that tu logislatios of the hist Congress in regard te silver, so far as it was based cb an antieiMted rise in the value of sil ver as a result of th ct legislation, has failed to produce the effect tnen predicted. The longer the law remains in force, sequiriag as it does the ccinagc ef a nominal dollar, which, in reality, is n -t a dollar, the greater bacomes tae danger that this mnary a ill be farced to ac cept a' Mingle metal as th soie legal standard of value, in calculation, and this a standard of le vain, than it purports to ba worth in the recog nized monev of the world. The Constitution of the United States, sound financial pvlneiples, ana our best interests, all require that tue country should have, as its ie-ra'.-tmder money, both gold and silver coin, of an intrinsic value, as bullion, equiva lent to fiat which, upon its face, it purports to pisse s. The Constitution, in express terms, recognizes both gold aad silver as the only true lcgal-tendur money. To banish either of thrsa me tals from our enrrer cy is to. narrow and limit the circulating medium of axcuange to th dis paragement of important interests. . The United State produce- more silver .than any.oiher country, and is directly interested in maintain ing it a. ons of the twe pr-oious m.Lai. which famish th. coinage of th. wot id. It woP, ia my judgm.nt, .intribut to tins result if Cos grass will repeal so inicu of xitiug legisla tion as r. mir the aoinage f silver dollar containing onlv 4l'i grains of silver, and in it stead will authorise the Secretary of the Treas ury to coin tilver dollars of eqaivaient vain a bullion, with gold dollars. Turn will d.fiand no man, and will b in accordance with fcmliar prec -dents. Congress, on several occasions. Las alter jd t'-.e tatio of value between geld and silver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordar.es with the ratio of value between th two metals. In financial legislation every measure in th direction of greater fidelity in the disc tar ce of pec -iniary obligations, ha baen foand by ex perience to diminish the rotes ot interest which debtors are le tUired to pay, and to inoreaath facility with which money ean be obtainrd for every legitimate purpose. Onr own recant financial nistory shows bow surely money be oomos abundant whenever confidence ia the exact performance of moneyed obligations ia established. The Secretary of war report, that the ex penditures of tlia War Department for tna fii- eal year ended June 30. 18H0. were 39.924. T73.0S. The appropriation for this department, for th cm rent fiscal year, amount to (U,0-3,S -0.40. vv lui respect to th. army, tne ecrecary ln ltes attention to the tact u at its strcneth ia limit-Hi by statute (tmctiod 1,11s, Revised Stat utes) to not more than 30,uC0 enlisted man, but that nrovisos contained-in stnnranriation bills have limited expenditures to the enlistment of but 33,00 u It is believed the full legal strength is the least possible foroe at which th. present organization ean be main'ained, having la view efficiency, discipline, and economy, while the enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appronriation for pay of the army, the sav ing mr do In other respects wonld be more than an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the army would be largely in creased. The rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi River, and the great tide of settlers which nas flowed in nrton new ter ritory, impose on the military an entire change ot policy. Tbe maintenance of small posts along wagon and stage routes of travel is no longer neceasaiy. Permanent uuarters at points selected, of a more substantial character than those heretofore constructed, will be required. Under existing laws permanent buildings can not be erected withont the sanction of Congress, and when sales of military sites and buildings have been authorized, the moneys received have reverted to the Treisury, and could only ltecome available through a new appropriation. It is recommended that provision be made, by a general statute, for the sale of such aban doned military posts and buildings as- are found to be unnecessary, and for the applica tion of the proceeds to tbe construction of other posts, while many of the present posts are of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed condition of the country, their occupation is continued at great expense and inconvenience, because they afford the only svanaoie sneiter ior troops. The absence of a large number of officers of the line, in active duty, from their regiments, is a serious detriment to the maintenance of theH scrvice. The constant demand for small de tachments, each of which should be command ed by a commissioned officer, and the various details of officers for necersary service away from their commands, occasions a scarcity in the number required for company duties. With a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law authorizing the detail of officers fiom the active list as profess ors of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities, be so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the retired list or the army. Attetit.on is asked to the necessity of provid ing by legislation for oreanizins-. arming, and disciplining the active militia of t ie country, and liberal appropriations are recommended in thif behalf. Theieperts of the Adjutant Gen eral of the Army end the Chief of Ordnance touching this subject fully set foithlU impor tance. The report of the officer in charge of educa tion in the army shows that there are seventy eight schools now in operation in the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The Secretary recommends the enlistment of one hundred and fifty school masters, wi(h the rank and pay of commissary sergeants. An appropriation is needed to sup ply the judge advocates of the army with 8 ui ta ble libraries, and the Secretary recommends that the corps of judge advocates be placed npon the same footing, as to promotion, with the other staff cori s of the army. Under exist ing laws, the Bureau of Milit uy Justice con sists of one officer, the Judge Advocate General, and the corps of judge advocates, of eight of ficers of equal rank rank, (majors) with a pro vision that limit of the corps shall remain at four, when reduced by casualty or resignation to that nambsr. The consolidation of the Bu reau of Miltary Justice and the corps ot judge advocates upon the same basis witu the other "staff corps of the army would remove an un just disci imitation again deserving officers and subserve the best interests of the service. Especial attention is asked to the 1 eport of the Chief of Engineers upon the condition of our national defenses. From a personal inspec tion of many of the fortifications referred to, the Sec: etary is able to emphasize the recom mendations made, and to state that their in complete and defenseless condition is discred itable to the country. While other nations have been increasing their means for carrying on of fensive warfare and attacking maritime cities, we have been dormant in prep-aration lor de fense: nothing of import mce Lai been done towards strengthening and finishing our case mated works since our late civil war, during whieh the great guns of modern warfare and the heavy armor of modern fortifications and ships came into hse,among the nations, and our earthworks left, by a sudden failure of appro priations some years since, in all stages of in complotion, are now being rapidly destroyed by the elements. - The two ifreat livers ot the No''th Amu lean continent, the.

An appropriation of idjo.tioo was made by the Forty-filth Congress for tbe commencement of a breakwater and harbor of refuge, to be located at tome point between the Straits of Fuc-a and San Francisco. at which the necessities of commerce, local and general, will be best accommodated. -The amount appropriated is thought to be quite in adequate ior the purpose intended. The cost of the work, when finished,' will lie very great, owing to the want of natural advantages for a site at anv point on the coast between the designated limits, and it has not been thought to bo advisable to undertake tho work without a large'r appropriation. I commend the matter to t he attention of Congress. The completion ot tne new building for the War Department in urgeutly neseied. and tho estimates for etontinuing its construction are especially rttconimenvled. The culleetiou - of books, specimens, and records const. uting the Aimy Meoical Museum mid Librai y are ot - national importance. The library now contains about fifty-one thousand five huudred i.'.l,500i volumes aud fifty-seven thousand :67,0jO. pamphlets rotating to me li cit!. surgery, and allied topics. Tho content! Their destruction would be an irreparable lot s, net only to the Uni.ed States,- but to the w r d. There are filed in the record and pension divi sion over sixteen thousand tl6,0O0i bound vol umes of hospital records, toge her with a great quantity of papers, embracing the original records of ths hospitals of our arm tea during the civil war. Aside from their hist oral value, these records are daily searchei for evidenc? needed in tbe settlement of large numbers of pension and other claims, for the protection of th government against attempted frauds, &3 well as for the benefit of honest claimants. These valuable collections are now in a build ing which is peculiarly exposed to the danger of destruction by fire. It is therefore earnestly recommended that an appropriation be made for a nw fire proof building, adequate fort's present neee and reasonable futuie expansion of these valuable collections. Such a building should be absolutely fire-proof ; no expenditure ior mere architectural display is required. It is Leilered that a suitable structure can be erected at a cost not to exceed two hnndied and fifty thousand dollars, ($260,000.) ' I commend to th att ention of Congress the great services of the Commander-in-Chief of our armies during the war for the Union, whose wise, firm, and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. The lagislatlon of the United States contains many precedents for the recognition of distin guished military merit, authorizing rank and emolument to be conferred for eminent services to tbe country. An act of Congress authorizing the appointment of a Captain General of the Army, with suitable provisions relating to com- Itensation, retirement and other details, would, n my Judgment, be altogether fitting and piop er, and would be waimly approved by tho country. The report of the Secretary of the Navy ex hibits the successful and satisiaotory manage ment of that department durins the last fiscal year. Tbe total expenditures for the year were (12,116.639.45, leaving unexpended at the close of the year 92,141,6iM.23 of th amount of avail able appropriations. The appropriations for the present fiscal year ending June 30, 18-il, ar $l,cv,061.45; and th. total estimates for ths next fiscal year ending June 30, ldotl. ar. $15, 953,751.01. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1, 1S80, to November 1. 1880, is $3,041,570.45. Th. rocoBini.uriutoou- of the Secretary ot th. Kavy, that provision I- -ttade for Vie establishment of soma form of oivil goVearmunt for th peopl. of Alaska is approved.

The steps taken to re to re order have been see apted in good faith by both white aud Indian inhabitants, and th necessity for tills method of re slxaint does not, in my opinion, now exist. If, however th Jamestown should 1 withdrawn, Jeuv ing the peoula. as at present, withont the ordinary judiil&l and administrative authority of orvaiuxed local government, aetious consequence might enuue. The laws provide only for the collection of revsuue, the protection of public property, aud the transmis sion of mails. Th problem is to supply a local ruie for a population so scattered aud so pecaliar in its origiti and couilidon. The natives are reported to be teacheable and self-snpportutg, aud if properly in structed, doubtlcs would advance rapidlyin civiliza tion, and a new factur of prosperity would be ad.'ed to the national lif. I therefore recommend tharaiul site legislation upon this subject. The S -ci-stary of the Navy has taken steps toward the establishment of naval coaling stations at tbe isthmiis of Panams, to meet the re-iuirements of our commercial relations with Central and ttouth Ameri ca, which are rapid :y Browing in iniiiortaure. Loca stoua eminenttr .nittble, both as regards our naval purposes and the uses of commerce, have been se lected, one on the east side of the Isthmus, at Chirt qui Lagoon, in the Caribbean Sea. and the other on tbe ranee coast, at the Hay ot Uointo. Tne only sate harbors, sufficiently commodious, on the Isthmus, are at these points, and the distance between them is less than on. hundred lui'es. The report of the Sec retary of the Navy concludes with valuable sitirieea tion with iwspe.tt to the building up of our merchnnt znarine service, which deserve uie favorable consider tion of Coogrei-s. . The report of the Postmaster General exhibit the conanuai growtn ana tne nign state ci eiretency ot tbe postal srrvice. The operat-ious of no department f the government, perhaps, represent with greater txactness the increase in the population and the busi ness of the country, in IS'10 the postal - receipts were tf 8,fil8,0t57.4o : in 188t the receipts were 33, 313,47l).3.4. Ail the inhabitants of thtt country are directly and personally interested in havintr proiier mail f ac-ihhes, and nsttnMlly watch the posteffice very co.'ely. This careful oversight on the part of the people has proved a eeonstant stimulus to improve ment. During the past year there was an increase of '. 134 postotfices, and the mail routes were extended 27,17 1 mipts, ui akin an additional annr.al trans portation of 10,:04.1!il mllea. The revenues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated at 3.S.845,174.10. and the exi enaitun s at 4 -,17.5.-WA'l, leaving a defle-iency to be appropriatt d out of the Treasury of 3.630.757 SI0. .

Toenab e cite Unit-d Slate 10 do its lull share of this great work, additions' le-ghuation is asked by the Postmaster eenrraJ, fo whose recommendations especial attention is asked.

'i ho ne easily t -r acid.t ontu proviston, to sfd in the transae.ion of the bus n-ess of the Penlerai courts, be comes each e ear more apparent.

" ' In my annual mot-sages heretofore, and in my specinl inessane of Dec. lit, 187U, I hays urged upon the attention of Consnvus tlte necessity of rcclalmiug the marshes of the Potomac ad iaceirt to the capital, and I am constrained by its importance to advert again to the subiect. Those fas embrace an imi of '" several hundred ac es. They are an impediment to . . tLe drainage of the ity. ami serroiialy impair its - ' hc7th. Itis behevelthat, with this substantial im provement of its r.ver front, the capital would be; in alt ies peers, one of the ntost attractive cities in the world. Ae-itle ft-oitt its periuaneut population, this city is necessnrily the place of residence of persons from every section t f the couutry. tnteaged in the ' public service. Mpny others ret-ide here tempor- ' aiilv. for the transaction of bniueiss with thA oav. . ermnent. It should not be forgotten that the land acquired will probably be worth the ccst of reclaiming it, and that the navigation of the river will te greatly im proved. I therefore again invite the attention of Con-' gress io the importance of prompt provision for this . much-needed and too long delayed improvement. . The water supply of the city is inadequate. m ad dition to the ordinary use throughout the city, the . cousumpb'ou by Government is necessarily very . great in tbe navy-yard, arsen-cl, and the various De- ' partmcnts,audalai--e quantity is required for the' ; proper preservation of the numerous parks and the' cl -arising of sewers. I recommend that this subject ' re; etve the early attention of Congress, and that, ia making provision for the increased supply, such m -aus be adopted as will have in view tho fhtnra growth ot tbe city. Temporary expedients for such ' apurpoBu csnnot but be wasteful ot money, and .. th Tefore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with oerresponding lacilities for keeping it filled, should. in my judgmen. be constructed. I commend again- - , j to the attention of Congress the subject of the removal, from tlieir present location, of the depots " ' of tlie several railroads entering tbe city; and I renew 1 the recommendatious of my former messages in be half of the erection ot a building for the Cong-res-lonal Library; the completion of the Washington ' Monument, and of liberal appropriations in support of the behevoletit. reformatory, and penal inatitu ilons of the District. - - liCTHEllFOIlD B. ilAYE8 ' .4 Eikcutivu ilixsroN, Dtr. 6, 1SS0.
