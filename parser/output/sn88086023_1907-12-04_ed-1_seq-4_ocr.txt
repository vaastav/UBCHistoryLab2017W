UNION. -JLABE i E'en though my deeds be not Inscribed Upon my country's scroll of fame; E'en though the records of the time In which I live bear not my name; If I shall utter but one word But sound one note In life's refrain. Tward making earth a better place, Then I shall not have lived In vain. W. H. Williams. SCOTTS RENUNCIATION. Some of the papers of Oregon are inclined to censure Editor II. W. Scott, of the Portland Oregonlan, for declaring his political Independence, for forsaking the republican party after 50 years of labor in its ranks. The East Oregonlan is not so In clined. It rather congratulates Mr. Scott on having the courage to re nounce old associates, to forsake old I-aths. It requires courage to make a sn - cere change of wind, to pass out of an old environment. The man who has not experienced that sort of a mental change Is no judge of its con- ment upon such until he has been tempered in the fire of experience. The renunciation of H. W. Scott Is all the more commendable and In spiring, when It is considered that ho is past middle age, a man of fixed habits of thought and action, a man of intense determination and sincere convictions. Very few men change either their politics, religion or habits, of life, after having passed middle age. The ci.iiiviiiiiiii. J L jvuiii niiu J u lift manhood takes deep root In the lives of men and to renounce and forsake associations and lines of thought fol lowed clostly for half a century is a triumph of mental strength and mor &' courage which is not to be dis paraged. That Mr. Scott walks out of the republican ranks and declares him self and his paper absolutely Inde pendent hereafter, is triumph enough for one life time. No man who has never forsaken a cause in which he has fought valiantly and long, though deluded, can understand the mean ing of his renunciation. It costs something which the aver age man cannot pay, to uproot the old convictions in the mind and as sume an entirely new attitude toward life and its surroundings. Harvey Scott has had the courage to take the step and he will always be glad of It. It Is a fitting act with vhlch to crown a long career of vital activity. His personality and his pa per will wield a stronger influence In Oregon, Independently, than they have ever wielded as partisan in strumentalities. THE ROOSEVELT DOCTRINE. Summed up in a few words, the Roosevelt doctrine as enunciated In the president's message to congress, , la as follows: law enforcement for the trusts and combinations; regulation and strict control for the railroads; the di vorcement of stock gambling from the financial and commercial Interests of .the country; punishment for dls Lonest speculators who manipulate the money supply to the detriment of the nation; open rivers, not only in the east and central states, but In THE 

WEST; more government rec lamation; more practical forestry de velopment; public lands for actual settlers; range leasing for the west; strict and unfailing control of Inter state commerce by the federal gov ernment; more elastic currency; tar iff reform when consistent ar.d prac ticable; construction of the Panama canal as quickly and cheaply as pos sible; no grafting, boodling or cor ruptlon In any government depart ment; a government for the people, free from sectional prejudice; the highest possible development of edu cation, citizenship and personal In tegrity for every child In the nation o strong hand for the support of every deserving American Industry, but the "big stick" for the grafter, the parasite and the drone; enlight ened independence, clean, wholesome progress; fearless manhood and wo manhood and sturdy personal honor lii every man and woman of the na tion. Aside from the political recommen dations of the president's message it breaths a pure and wholesome spirit of good citizenship, fearless man hood and personal Integrity and Is a sermon worthy of the man who wrote it.
