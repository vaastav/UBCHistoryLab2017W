There new waa any want U Kansas for men of action and Just now university student and oth ers of the "neversweat" class are go ing down Into the coal pita wider th protection of tbelr own militia to get out the necessary material to keep their IndiiBtrlea going and their borne warm.

Kanaaa waa found i k. km vhfi worked ' and fought their own battlea and their aona are worthy to receive the patrimony ana alo able to keep It It will take more than coal strikes to keep the Kansana down. New Mexico la not. unfortunately, maintaining tlte tradition of tta pio neer. It ha heaTy prodttrtng coal mines, but la looking for too much out- KoIm tn Iriwm HiAra mninm. For one thing the present administration has failed to reorganise ira national guaru and la dependent on federal protection. Other states, Including our neighbors Arianna, Texas and Colorado bare all made provisions for their atate troop. TMre Is no Talld excuse why New Mexico cannot do the same. 

COAL STRIKE ISFLOlTtlSIIINO What effect the 14 per cent advance In wages hew out to tne sinaiux miners will hare remains to be seen. The Immediate effect is to lessen pro duct ion in nnion operated mines where more men ar walking out and even the caretakers of idle shafts are quit ting their posts. It looks as though the strike would go to show down. If the advance is to have any effect it ihould be noted In the next few dav. Meanwhile, the government as sures toe public that the mines will iw nnoratail h th mvernmnt. If no ewary, or under the protection of the government In puces wnere we miners f bow a desire to return to work.

POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IS ON The lfrJO campaign opens with the formal call for the meeting of the democratic central committee at Wash ington on January 8. The republican central committee meets on December 10. It la thought that the republican convention will go to Chicago and the democratic convention to 8t Loots. The democratic convention will proba bly meet around the Fourth of July. To beat them to the "spread eagle" stuff the republicans are expected to meet around the middle of June. There Is, so far derth of issue. Both par ties are afraid of the league of nations as an Issue, public sentiment being either divided or apethetio on the sub ject Anywsy things are so kaleldes cople that the signs fall and party leaders are wondering what the Ameri can people will be Interested in next November rather than Just now. The "Irreeoucllablea" la tne senate, mostly republicans, will try to get the reservation program endorsed. This is against the best - judgment of the leaders and they will try to sidestep tlte Issue. It is possible that com . mmmiM the reservation proem m will be urged by republican and demH ocratio leaders alike in oroer to uw. the vexed question out of the way, making room for the "paramount" la mnm rM tn he duff un. Just now. how ever, the leaders of both the ok! par ties are in a quandary, ui course. "Americanism" l going to pay an Immrtant natt and both conventions are going to pinch the poor old eagle to make him scream bla kindest. But the people still have the big surprise np tbeir several sleeves ana tne party leader are making wild guesses as to what It la. cent Increase In wages wlU bring back ma of ' tne miners, but so far the strikers are standing firm. Meanwhile. hi Kansas and elsewhere attempts are being made to open up the mines with volunteer, but the fact remains that only about 60 per cent of the usual production Is being naatntalned and the coal reserve la approaching toe vanishing point To meet the crisis the government with Fuel Administra tor Garfield In charge is placing more stringent restrictions on the ne of coal than obtained during the war, which mean that many Industrie classed as "non-essential" will hare to so spend.
