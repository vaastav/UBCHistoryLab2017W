IfET nrtßVtni T^ THE mBCXE-1 yVashingto-*. Dec 3. — The Supreme Court's de cision in the Philippine case ie causing greater activity among the leaders of both the Senate add House nt present than any other subject^ iritis which the new Congress will deal. With out preparation or warning, the leaders find thmselves confronted by a situation that is of -pressing importance. regardless of what may be thought of its intrinsic merits. While there is nothing of gravity or danger in the situation, yet it is conceded on all hands that it belongs to. that category of unavoidable accidents the •ooner mended the better. It is with the view of avoiding a.ll embarrassments in the future that immediate action by Congress on the Phil ippine question is now being urged. Until the breach made In the Dfngley tariff by the Supreme Court's decision is filled by legisla tion, there will be absolute free trade in all products that comprise the commerce between ihe United States and the Philippines. As un der the operations of the Dingley law this trade averaged more than $3,000,000 a year, the great bulk of which was In articles already . d the free list, it can easily be seen how this trade Will be largely increased during the period of ti*e" trade at thlt- end of ih- Tine nnitrtu Sy iim Supreme Court's mandate. Cane sugar is about U> only dutiable article from the Philippines the' has been brought here in any considerable (juantity since American sovereignty was ex tended over the islands. In three years and one north from September 1. ISK, to October 1, Pit, 93.000.000 pounds of Philippine raw sugar. Invoiced at $l,«!<»l.<t»M». have been imported to the United States. On this amount $1,442,000 las been paid by the importers in tariff duties. Marly all this money will have to be refunded to the Importers, or at least to all who paid customs dues under protest. What proportion cf them failed to enter formal protest cannot tow be learned. It is reasonable to suppose that the importers who brought in this sugar from the Philippines when they had to pay the full Dtngtey rates on it will now take advantage of the opportunity to bring in as much of this commodity as possible while the tariff bars are cowr. . 

SUGAR MEN' BESTIRRING THEMSELVES. I- po!nt of fact, it is known that the interests fa this country which utilize raw sugar from th* Philippines are already bestirring them selves energetically to profit to the utmost limit ty Ike present favorable situation. Reports Iron the islands, some of them brought by re turning members of Confess, indicate that an sensually large crop of sugar was produced in the < Philippines this year, and this fact, of cmrse, is an addition;. l spur to the desire to ret in an unusual amount of the product while it is on th- free list. Hence the volume of free sugar that can be brought from the. Philippines depends only on the two factors of the duration of the free trade period and the ships to carry It la. The chief concern of Congress is not to shut Philippine sugar out of this country, but rather to provide the neces.-:ary Revenue for the Insular ■iMUnent. Every cent of the $1,500,000 that *« been collected at San FYarcisco and other . pwts on raw sugar from the Philippines has I bees: devoted to the needs of the Philippine ; tovernment. Therefore, the question arises as to how the deficit which will be caused by the ■■ *»" to the Philippine revenues by the Supreme Conn's decision, can be made up. Congress, of ttnne, will appropriate '.he amount required | •« the payment of refunds, but there is no dis- D*kwi in Congress to appropriate money out . 5 tie Federal Treasury for the support of the "Sprint government. The basis of the whole : PMal scheme is that each insular government ; •fcwiM and can be made self-supporting. Thus . ■rthis scheme has worked admirably, but it is "^tended that unless room: new method is im mediately devised for raising revenue for the r aßlpp:nV« i through import taxes at both ends 01 th* line, there will have to be a complete ; fusion of the well .matured' plan of govern- ; ment for the archipelago. ■ *AY 

EXTEND DINGLEY LAW TEMPORA- j ULT. A* under "the terms of the Supreme Court's j Vision Congress is empowered to levy tariffs ; °"> 'products from the Philippines imported to the United. States, there is scarcely any likeli hood that the lawmakers will fail to take ad- Vantage if this privilege. But as the element of j tee is a big factor in the problem, it is pretty j ttnerally agreed that the most expeditious , course now open to ■ Congress is found in the , •assertion of the adoption <>t a joint resolution : Attending the Dingley rates to Philippine com- j aodiUes. This would restore the old order or i things that was upset by the Supreme Court on j Monday and. pending the enforcement of the , Dingley law by this method a new and adequate j avenue scheme for the Philippines can be d?- , ««*<s and passed by Congress at this session, if { that course eventually is considered advisable. f : Therefore it Is thought that within toe next j ***" days Senator Lodge, as chairman of the j Philippine Committee, will offer a joint rtsolu «on formally extending the Dingley law to the , wands* commerce with this country. How long \ * should take to get such a resolution through •Cth houses is a mere matter of speculation at ' *ls Juncture, and depends largely on what the ""Inority In the Senate would do. The resolution *•« be put through the House in short order - IMcr the . rules of that body which limit de ' Th* only through Sleeping car route.

POLK AND MI"T<HI.EK. bate, but as there is no such rule in the Senate the discussion there might become interminable. Then, too. there is some danger that the House will contend that a resolution of the character described must originate in that body and not in the Senate, since it deals with a question of raising revenue. This, however, could not of itself delay action for any considerable time, as In order to expedite matters the Senate prob ably would yield and permit the resolution to originate In the House. Senators Lodge, Spooner, Plait, of Connecticut; Aldrich and Al lison are now looking into the whole question with the view of getting the joint resolution be fore Congress at the earliest practicable date. NEW PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT AW. Senator Lodge also is conferring with Secre tary Hoot on the subject of a new government bill for the Philippines, which will be modelled in general principles upon the Poraker Porto Rican bill. This does not mean that, the Philip pine government will necessarily be patterned in detail after the local government in Porto Rico which was provided by the Poraker bill. It means merely that the Supreme Court has affirmed the constitutionality of the Foraker scheme, and therefor* prudence and common sense suggest that the lines of this measure be followed with reference to the Philippines. The two propositions, however, are separate and dis tinct. The proposed joint -union is a neces sity to meet an immediate condition. The local government scheme on which the Secretary of War and Senator Lodge are at work Is to meet the changed situation that will be brought about in the Philippines when the Insurrection is com pletely suppressed and the people are prepared for more general local self-government than they are now able to administer. CABINET DISCUSSES DECISIONS. SATISFACTORY TO THE ADMINISTRATION TARIFF IN THE PHILIPPINES NOT AFFECTED. <Ny The km dated Pits?.) Washington. Dec. 3.— The Cabinet meeting to day was principally, consumed in a discussion of the insular decision handed down yesterday by Hxe. Supreme Court, On th«» v. hole, ft «* ht-n^Ved. the views of tbe majority of the court were sat isfactory to the administration. It was pointed out that the ultimate results of the decisions are in a measure speculative at present, with th* exception that the customs duties collected in this country on goods shipped from the Philip pines since the ratification of the Paris treaty will have to be refunded. It is not thought, how ever, that the aggregate will be large. and Sec retary Gage thinks that It will be less than . «1.- OUO.OOO. He called attention to the fact that the great hulk of the imports from the Philippines were admitted free of duty under the general tariff laws, notably hemp, which is one of the leading staples of the islands. It was said at th- War Department to-day that the decision does not call for any change in the existing tariff ar rangements in the Philippines, and that it was not even deemed necessary to issue instructions to the civil governor of the islands on the sub ject. Secretary Root has had several conferences with other officials in regard to the enactment of legislation necessary to meet existing condi tions, but he said to-day that as he had not yet received an official copy of the court's decision be was unable even to indicate what steps should \>e taken. The Secretary of the Treasury to-day issued , to collectors of customs in the United States an order directing them to admit free of duty goods imported from the Philippines. SAILED WITH JOY AT MANILA. SOLDIERS CAN BEND PRESENTS DUTY FREE -REVISION OF TAXATION REQUIRED. Manila. Deo. .'{.—The local newspapers here published extras when they received the news of the United States Supreme Court decision in the fourter-n diamond rings case that the Philippines won- American territory and that the imposi tion of duty on articles imported Into ihe United States from the Philippines Is Improper. The announcement of the decision caused great ex ■ Itemeat and jubilation among the merchants and general public here. Representatives of the principal business houses say it will revolu tionize the entire trade of the Orient, and the civilians and military men are pleaded at tho prospect of sending presents home without hav ing to pay duty on them. The civil authorities h«-re have not yet formed an opinion on the subject, but they think the law only applies to goods going to the United States, and are anxiously awaiting an official communication or. the subject, sine", if th>- de cision holds here, fresh means for obtaining funds to run the government will be necessary. General Luke Wright, the Vice-Governor, thinks that a general revision of taxation is Imperative. The Spanish merchants are pleased, since Spanish goods have the same treaty rights as American goods. The custom house was besieged to-day by importunate inquirers, and the decision of the Supreme Court was the only thing talked about at the clubs, in mercantile circles and in the civil and military offices.

GIVE BOND FOR HIM Johann Beck, nf Hamburg, the starving stow away, who came over nailed up in a box on the Hamburg-American steamer Palatia, has found a champion in the person of Newton Benning ton, a broker, at No. 52 Broadway. Mr. Ben nington declare:! last night at his home at Ben sonhurst that any man who showed so much pluck as to nail himself up In a box, and take such perilous chances in order to reach this country, deserved a helping hand. "This plucky German will not be deported if I can help it," continued Mr. Bennington. "I like Ills spunk. I believe he has the stuff in him that good American citizens are made of. I arranged to-day with the immigration authori ties to file the necessary bonds holding myself responsible that he does not become a public Charge. I understand the bonds required amount to but a few hundred dollars. I an willing to" wager this sum upon the man's pick ing up and becoming a worthy citizen. "Some of my friends on the train this morning argued that the man should be deported because of hi? conduct. I took the opposite view. The case will be brought before the special board of inquiry as booh as Beck gets well." WHO BECK 1?. It became known yesterday that Johann Beck, twenty-five years old. was a painter by trad-?, who, because of poverty, freighted himself as a "model" to this country in the hope of finding work here. A union workman's card found In his pocket showed that .ho was born ln-<»er many, and that he had been in the employ of a house painter of the name of A. R. JI lister/ at Hamburg. A letter from X>umull*»r & Bchaefrr. proprietors of the Union Square Hotel, received yesterday morning: by Charles A. Donovan, Chirr of Police of Hoboken, cleared up the mystery as to the motives of the stowaway in boxing himself up as living freight. This letter was re ceived by Mr. Schaefer about ten days ago. It read a.s follows: Prom J. Beck. Hamburg. Nov. IS. In :;:ti. with speed 10 New-York. Sir: Without work and without means I am at the end of my resources! and to procure my boat and at the same time to come to the land of my hopes 1 ;im to SPiifl myself ami good? by th»- ship Palatia, Captain Resslng. I calculated upon your magnanimity which will spare me an unpleasant return. 1 have not the honor of heln«r acquainted with you. I in not afraid of any work, and should like work at th« expenses. Coming with the Palatia, as already mentioned. I leave Hamburg on Sunday, Nov. 17. in the hope of arriving In New-York in £"•"! health. I have need to beg for my excuse as w«-i! p<« for the trouble as my bad English. My best thanks In advance. Most respectfully, JOHANN BECK. "I (bought some lunatic had written me," said Mr. Schaffer. "anil so paid no attention to the letter. The man probably picked up" one of our business cards at Hamburg and trusted to us to give him work. The American Express Corn- pany, shippers of the box. evidently suspected something was wrong- A week ago they asked me about the box of 'artists' models' that was consigned to me. " Wh<"n seen last evening at St. Mary's Hospital, Hoboken, Beck disclosed his name and address, and said that he bad travelled under such origi nal circumstances because of his poverty. DID IT AXJL. HIMSKI.F. "No one knew of my act," he said slowly, and with great difficulty "1 made the hox and ar ranged everything myself. I paid the freight of :;u mark- at the fr«-ipht office of the Hamburg- American Line, an<l 1 left word for an express company to call for it .it my address, So. -- Langestrasse, Hamburg. Then I went home an.l :< -i ked myself in the box by a series of hooks and eyes. I was conscious throughout the entire trip, but lost my senses when we reached New- York. The rats gnawed ;;t 'he box and tried to get in. but did not. It was very cold. When I start* d I had twelve cans of condensed milk, a box of prunes, three dozen cakes of chocolate, some bread, and a little whiskey." At this point of the interview the physician in terrupted the speaker and told him to go to sleep. It is estimated that Beck paid from $10 to ?IT> for the box. provisions and freight charges, or about one-half of what he would have paid to travel by steerage. A longshoreman, who removed .Beck's box from the hold of the Palatia, said that it con tained a mattress made of a nightshirt stuffed with straw, some underclothing, a suit of clothes, collars, cuffs, a hat, overcoat, some silk embroidered nightshirts, and some empty soda water bottles. ■ , A dispatch received yesterday from Hamburg reported that the stowaway is an Austro-Ger man painter, known in Europe as a "box trav eller." According to the dispatch; Beck intend ed to travel to California and the Klondike in the same manner. This report received no con firmation yesterday. At the hospital last night it was said that Beck would probably recover. He Is in the cus tody of the Hamburg-American Steamship Com pany, though the Hoboken police took an imme diate part in the investigation. As soon as his condition permits he will be taken to Ellis Isl and and held as a stowaway. The stowaway line is .<lO. It is believed that, through the pub licity given to his performance, the money will easily be raised to pay the fine. SQUADRON, TO VISIT HAVANA. Washington.

" Six members of the Kings County Democratic General Committee- resigned las* night in order to make way for the election of representatives of the Shepard Democracy, in pursuance of the policy out lit.td to reorganize the party and rejuvenate it from its sweeping defeat at the last election. The meet ing of the committee last night was held In the Thomas Jefferson Building. The following mea were elected: Ist District. George Foster Pea body and A \usustus Healy. in place of Joseph B.

William Hughes was elected temporary chairman, and the committee adjounfed for a week. Before the next meeting one of the independent Shepardites. possibly George Foster Peabody, will be induced to take the position of permanent chairman. Deputy Police Commissioner Bernard J. loth. made a long speech, in which be explained the plans for reorganization. He said that those who had resigned were active members who had come to the front to create vacancies in order thai the committee might carry out a policy that they be lieved would best serve the interests of the or ganization. No one. Mr. York said, was running away in time of defeat, and the organization was really stronger after this serious defeat than after' and previous defeat.

BOTH BOUSES PASS RESOLUTIONS ON MKINLEYS DEATH. AND THEN ADJOUKX. Washington. Dec. 3.— The Senate listened to the first Message of President Roosevelt to-day. The Message was delivered soon after the Sen ate met. xi ■ reading occupied nearly two and a half hour?, and was listened to with marked respect by the Senators. The first portion, deal ins with the Buffalo tragedy, excited the most profound interest. The Message was sent to Congress this year for the first time in print. The two copies for the two houses were printed on paper of the same size as that used heretofore for the written copies, though the paper is a. heavy white in stead of the blue tint which has been In use. Each copy was richly bound in brown morocco, with stiff covers, with simple gold border and lettering, the words on the front being, "Mes sage of the President of the United States, 1910." After the reading of the Message Mr. Foraker, the senior Senator from Ohio, presented the fol lowing resolution, for which he asked immediate consideration: That a committee of eleven Senators be ap pointed on the part of the Senate to join such committee as shall be appointed on the part of the House to consider and report by what token of respect and "affection it may proper for the Congress of the United States to express the deep sensibility of the nation to the* tragic death of the Kite President. William M'-Kinley. and that so much of the Message of MM Presi dent as relates to that deplorable event be re ferred to such committee. The resolution was adopted, and then, as a. further mark of respect to the memory of the late President, the Senate, on motion of Mr. i Foraker. adjourned. 

PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE. Not in many years have the members of the ; House listened with such rapt attention to the i annual message of a President of the United ! States as they did to-d:. y to the reading of the : first Message- of President Roosevelt. Every 1 word was followed intently from the announce , ment of the tragic death of President McKinley. in the opening sentence, to the expression of the I closing wish that the relations of the United States with the world should continue peaceful. The reading occupied two hours, but not over a dozen member? left their seats until it was ' finished. Several times there was applause, and at the close there was an enthusiastic demon stration on the Republican side.
