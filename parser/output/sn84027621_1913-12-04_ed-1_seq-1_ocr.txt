Making Another 3Iexico Ont of the Islands i Boston, Dec. 4. "Shall we make another Mexico of the Philippine Is lands?" With the question W. Cameron Forbes, former governor general of the Philippine Islands closed an address last night before the City Club in which he defended the policy of the United States to wards its dependency in the east, and warned against a premature withdrawal" of control. "President Wilson has started up on a new policy in the islands," said Mr. Forbes. "He ha's given the Fil ipinos a 'majority on the commission and appointed them to a few other places which previously were held by Americans. I believe the motive underlying these changes is a praise worthy desire to let the Filipinos prove their merit and show what they could do, and I do not feel that!. A. , , . A. A . , i in the crowded bunks on the top the experiment should be unduly criticised, but that we should wait with suspended judgment to let the poficy have a chance to work itself out and show what the result will be. Mut Maintain Stable Government "Looking at the situation broadly, there i3 one fundamental thing to which the United States has pledged itself, viz: To establish and main tain a stable government in the Phil ippine Islands. "The real significance -of the Am erican work in the Philippines has been giving freedom to millions of people really held in, serfdom. The premature withdrawal from the is- 1 J J a 1 a 1 1 lanas ana me premature reunquisn-j struggling humanity. Despite shouts ment of control will set back theof assurance from below three men hands ol the clock, and undo the , woriv we nave aone ana return mese ; . . i i ' people to the bondage from which i we have partly delivered them. "My recommendation is that we proceed along what I consider the only safe line of procedure, namely, that of evolution, that we fill the lower branches of the service with Filipinos, let them grow up with it, give them careful, wise and thoro ugh supervision, and promote them as a 'result cf efficiency, giving, them only vhat is good for them, not al . ways what they want. Scoffs at Neutralization "But let us not let go the firm an chor of assured sovereignty of the United States and try to tie up to any silly rope of snd, such as 'neu tralization.' Neutralization rests on nothing more than an agreement, and agreements among nations , are kept only so long as it is in the in terest of those nations to keep them. "How, if we give up control, are we to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the signatory pow ers to the agreement? To show you most graphically the position we should then be in, I have only one question to ask: Is not one Mexico enough? Shall we make a second Mexico of the Philippine Islands?"

No sound since last night has come from Utah-Apex mine, in which Ralph Lopez, the Mexican desperado, is confined. All the exits except that in the lower level, were sealed with doable bulkheads, and it is believed that the gas-filled mine has become the fugitives tomb. The watchfulness of seven sheriffs and more than 200 deputies, who expected a break for liberty on the part of Lopez, is relaxed, although the number of guards has not been lessened. It wa3 considered impos sible for the Mexican to approach any of the exits without being over come. The crowd of miners who has stood awaiting vengeance since two of their number were killed in the underground battle of Saturday, has dispersed. Before erecting the outer bulk head in the outer tunnel, six men went to the inner bulk-head, 300 feet from the mouth, to examine it. Shortly after one of their number staggered out overcome by the gas that had leaked out thru the parti tion! Deputies rushed inside and carried out the other five, all of whom had dropped within the tun nel. They were revived, but it was striking testimony of the deadliness of the gases that filled the mine. Thousands of pounds of wet gun powder were consumed to generate what is known and feared by miners as "black damp." Sulphur, coal tar, formaldehyde and black oil were the chief ingredients used in addition. Two hundred men are out of work in the lower level as a result of the smudging operations. The operators are said to be suffering a net loss of more than SI, 000 a day. They an nounced however, they would gladly remain idle a month in order to bring about the death of Lopez. The smudging will continue for twelve hours more, perhaps for twenty-four hours. It is thought the deputies will not be able to enter the mine before Friday night. WACAHOOTA Wacahoota, Dec. 4.

EliGUSH OPIIIIIS Iresident's Menage Discussed by the London Papers London, Dec. 4. The Times, which is devoting great atention to the Mexican situation, is publishing a free series of dispatches from Mex ico City, calling serious attention "to the desperate situation develop ing in consequence of the attitude of the United States," and declaring that if the American tactics of "watchful waiting" continues to be pursued "there are no words too strong to paint the disastrous results which will ensue." In an editorial on these dispatches and President Wilson's message, the Times says: "We are convinced that these dangers are realized as. fully at Washington as at Mexico City. Pres idents, like other, rulers, are not giv en to betraying the secrets of their policy in public utterances. We shall be surprised if, when Gen. Huerta is got rid of, President Wilson is not found to have thought out' and be ready to apply a plan for restoring order and decent government in Mexico." The other London morning papers note and comment the brevity of the President's message. The Stand ard and Daily Graphic see no reason to doubt that the President's policy will achieve the initial success of re moving Huerta. The Morning Post editorially ex presses . the opinion that President Wilson is too sanguine in assuming that the downfall of Huerta would solve the problem "and asks what will he do should. Mexico continue to be the prey of adventurous generals and politicians. The Daily Mail says the message gains in clarity by conciseness. "President Wilson's watchful at titude," declares the paper, "has dis armed critics who sought to at tribute predatory aims to the Wash ington cabinet. G. W. McKELVEY
