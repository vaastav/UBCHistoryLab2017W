M6I nx. DAILY EAST OREOONLVN, rENDLKTON, OREGON, TtTKSOAY, freECEMBETt , 1006. EIGHT PAGES. BILL TO STRENGTHEN GOAST DEFENCES . In bla forthcoming message .the president will reaffirm his position especially so far aa pending legisla tion providing for the reorganisation of the coast artillery la concerned. The senate committee ou military af fairs nss favorably reported a bill to separate the field artillery from the Coast artillery, on ihr ground that they are two distinct branches of the ervlte. The bill provides for the gradual increase during five years of 2H of ficers and 043 men for the coast ar tillery and S58 for the field artillery. The groat trouble of the coast ar tillery has been to secure and keep trained electricians, engineers and firemen. It will surprise many to know that most of the cost of fortifi cations is for electrical machinery, "fire control," and search lights, the "fire control" being the system of tel egraphic and telephonic communica tion between forts and batteries, and with observing nitlons. Millions of dollars Lave lrt.n cpent, and addi tional millions will be spent to estab lish power plants and lnstal costly electrical machinery, and yet the coast artillery Is expected to take care of them with enlisted men at J 13. 1 15 and J18 a month. For example: HO engineers are ab solutely necessary, and the bill pro vides for that number at $7 SO per an num each. The places of these en gineers are now filled by privates and non-comtnlssloned officers, the pay of the highest being $1S per month. Poor Pay In Army. .As such engineers can get from $T5 to $100 per month In private life, It Is almost Impossible to get them to re-enllst after they once qualify as en gineers, and thus the costly arc? intri cate machinery cf our coast defenses Is almost constantly in the hands of untried men. In addition, the work of constantly breaking In new men Is fxtremely trying to the officers, and discouraging to those who are at tempting to bring the coast artillery to a high state of efficiency. A private statement of the condi tion of the coast defenses of 2S for tified ports shews that ot man them with one shift of officers and men, that Is to say. each man at his proper station, would require 40 675 men, and 1634 effioers. There are today avall Lhle at tho different forts 10,713 men and 357 officers, scarcely enough to keep the guns and machinery from rusting. Larsre Force Required. Commercial interests In general and especially those concerned with shipping and terminals at our great ports will be Interested In this matter If they take the trouble to Investigate the facts. Take New York, for In stance, with Forts Totten, Schuyler Sloeum. Wadsworth, Hamilton and Hancock, equipped with big guns, torpedoes, search lights, etc. It would requires 224 officers and 5662 men to man these forts alone, without pro viding for any relief whatever. That is more' than two-thirds of all the effieers and half of all the men now engaged in taking care of all the coast defenses of the entire Vnitcd States. Other cities present interesting sta tistics. There Is San Francisco, the terminal of the Harrlman and other great transcontinental lines, and from which the ships of the Pacific Mail and other trans-Pacific lines carry our goods to the orient. Cost Is Enormous. To defnd San Francisco are Forts Foster, Miley. Parry. Raker. Bacon Whole Foot Nothing But Proud Flesh Tried Different Physicians and All Kinds of Ointments Could Walk Only With Crutches -Ohio Man Says : 

"CUTICURA REMEDIES THE BEST ON EARTH " "In the year 1S99 the side of my right foot was cut off from the little toe down te the heel, and the physician who bad charge of me was trying to sew up the side of my foot, but with no success. When he found out that wouldn't work, he began trying to heal the wound with all kinds of ointment, - until at last my whole foot and way up above my calf was nothing but proud flesh. I MifTerArl un told agonies for four years, and tried different physicians and all kinds of oint ments. I could walk only with crutches. It is sixteen months ago since I began using Cuticura Soap and Ointment for my limb and foot. The 6 rst two months the Cuticura Remedies did not seem to work, but I kept on using them both. In two weeks af tcrwards Fsaw a change in my limb. Then I began using Cuticura Soap and Ointment often dur ing the day and kept it up for seven months, when my limb was healed up just the same as if I never had trouble. "It is eight months now since I stopped using Cuticura Remedies, the best on God s earth. I am working at the present day, after five years of suffering. The cost of Cuticura Ointment and Soap was only ,8; but the doctors' bills were more like $000. You can publish my name and refer any one to write to me about Cuticura Remedies. I will answer all letters if postage is enclosed. John M. Lloyd, 718 8. Arch Ave., Alliance, Ohio, June 27, 1905..

SUFFERED AGONIES FOR FOUR YEARS I Winfteld Scott and McDowell. To man these would require ITS officers and 4268 men. There are available 4t officers and 1400 men. The coast defense plana call for the expenditure of $3,119,242 to complete the defenses of San Francisco, of which $439,600 is to be spent for guns, emplacements uiid carriages; $459,955 for submarine mine defenses,- $334,952 for a central power plant; $193,064 for a reserve power plant; $lt,000 for search lights; $19,600 for modernizing older emplacements, . and $1,473,991 for fire control." It will cost $1,473,991 to install a complete system of communication alone at San Francisco, and It is a sig nificant fact that this fire control ID' stallation will be the only one recora- mended to congress this year, because there are no men available to care for others if they should be lnttalled And, in passing. It may be remarked that for Forts .Mason. and McDowell at San Francisco, there are no men available at all. Portland's Needs. Portland la another place on the Pacific coast of Importance. Forts Columbia, Stevens and Canby defend Columbia river. It would require 67 officers and 144S men to properly man these defenses. Ten officers and 246 men are available. The national board estimates that $1,041,332 is necessary to complete these defenses, but there Is no prospect at present of congress oeing ever asked to appropriate a dol lar for this purpose, so long as 10 officers and 240 men do the work of 6. officers and 1446 men, and enlist ed men at $13 to $1S a month will fill positions as engineers, firemen, mas te rgunners, electricians, observers g'in pointers, etc. Seattle, Tacoma and Olvmpia, Wash., are important cities on the Pacific coast. How arc they provided with coast defenses? Puget sound is defended by Forts Warden Casey and Flagler. inese lorts are manned by a macrifl cent equipment of 27 officers and 902 men, where 139 officers and 3180 men are now required. Even at that there Is only one officer to 32 men, where the proportion should he one officer to 24 men. The coast defense plans call for an elaborate system of defense for Puget sound. An expenditure of $3,519,34? Is estimated as necessary to complete it. Of this $3,413,600 Is for new forts alone, including guns and carriage; A Western Wonder. There's a Hill at Bowie.

Harbaugh and will result In stocking the creeks trib utary to the Clearwater and Snake rivers with the eastern brook trout The fish will be received from the government hatcheries and It Is hoped to have all the arrangements complet ed In time to plant them In the spring. The method adopted to secure the fish Is for a citizen to make direct application to the United States fish commissioner at Washington, speci fying the stream that it is desired to stock. The applicant Is then provid ed with a blank for supplying data as to the stream. After filling out the blank It Is mailed to Game War den Harbaugh at Lewiston, who will forward all the applications to a mem bcr of Idaho's congressional delega tion urging the Interest of the latter In securing the allotment desired.
