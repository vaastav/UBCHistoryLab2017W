As a measure of revenge we don't believe in it, but as s meatu to secure milwmpily for lossra sustained at the hands of an enemy it ia not only jmtti niie nui becomes a pressing and nui mediate necessity, as well a duty. Nome of tha great papers of the country took u severely to tank for speaking out for our remedy. Sine that time two eminent and patriotic men from Teaas ia tha senate of the United State and six in the lower house bsv placed before the country a moderate but truthful statement of the wronps suf fered by our patient lorWers. and have awakened thesraipathy of the govern ment and the people for us. During the reign of bitter sectional ism and prejudice, which stretched be tween the periods when the war cloaed and when Hayes was inaugurated, all tha vital farts regarding the Mexican outrages on the Rio Grande wer sidu ously kept from the knowledge of the people. Indifference was the rule. Even the brave and devoted army made sttong representations to the executive, and they wer treated with corn or indifference. It was no part of the policy of the president to rudely inter rupt the processes by which he was be ing lifted from poverty to power and wealth, and bring into fuvoraM notice th people from whose necessities mon y waa wrung, and upon whoa defeat and humiliation his own and his com peers' glory rested.

TEXAS AND PACIFIC. Evr sine tha 1st happy unitization of too Texas delegation in congress upon th Texas and PariSo bill, th measure hat been tteadily gaining ground in both house and sen at.
