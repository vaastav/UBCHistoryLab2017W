GEO. A. McCARTER, Editor,, OFFICIAL COUNTY PAPER. "Sru-mjy, Arizona, Saturday, dec. 12, lsss. "What do you think of the message1? The Parnell party in England, hold the balance of power. Tildeh' U sound on the coast defense question, also on the tariff. Oariyilo was re-eleeted Speaker of theHouse of Representatives. Cleveland" prefers the Ead's ship railway to the Nicarauga canal. According to the. President silver mast go, and the Mormons also. A hill has already been introduced in Congress to repeal the . desert land I4ws.- Foreign relations are very friendly. The people are of course glad that such' is the case. The President's message' was read to Congress; Tuesday, by his assistant private Secretary. The President's message which was given to Congress on Wednesday, ..con-. tiunaro6;09'() words. A democratic presidential combina tion for 1888, has been made between Governors Hill, of New York, and Lee, of Virginia. The President believes that the In dians should be turned over to- the War Department, we' think it a good plan to catch them first. John Sherman's thirty years of pub Ec life, most of it in the Senate, will make him useful to his party as the President of the Senate. Blaine is getting to the front again and should he want the nomination in 18S8 he will in all probability,, receive it. He- is the strongest man in the party- As read' through democratic editor is! spectacles the message is a magnifi cent state paper;- as read through Re publican it is a humilating exhibition of intellectual feebleness and cowardly evasion. S. P. Post. The Republican minority of' the House of Representatives gave the complimentary nomination for Speak er to T. B. Reed, of Maine, a very close friend of Blaine's and his selec tion is, therefore, significant. When the question of prohibition comes up in the South, the negro has the fairest sort of a show to get his vote in and have it counted, too. Both prohibitionists and anti-prohibitionists are pleading, for instance in Goorgia, just now with the colored men to vote tbeir way. It is1 estimated that one-nineth of the golcf produced comes from the sil ver mines. It would seem that gold Was not wholly independent of silver and the use of theso two metals to gether, as currency, by the people of every age may have a deeper signifi cance than is apparent. In a game of draw at the national capital, a Boston man held four sevens and gave his1 ftote- for 300, with which to back his confidence fn the strength of his hand. He lost, however, and has been sued on the protested note. Nobody but a Boston man would have gone back on a hand like that. The following reasons are given by Gov. Ross, of New Nexico, for his re moval of Attorney General Breeden, on being asked by that gentleman for the whys and wherefores: "As to the cause for your suspension, permit me to say, and without intention of giving personal offense, but for the vindica tion of a public act, and m conserva tion of the public interest, that you were suspended for drunkeness, licen tiousness, gambling, and misfeasance, malfeasance and nonfeasance in office; crimes which ought not be tolerated in a public official. As a public office is a public trust, so a public official is a public exemp lar. The private life of a public of ficial is as much public property as his public life. No man who habitu ally infracts the laws of sobriety or decency is fit for a public trust. This you have done therefore I suspend ed you from office." Gov. Ross did right to give his reas- jyfts for the suspension of Breeden, and jes are true Breeden should But the Governor should be recently removed an ex- Dist. attorney and a nephew whose unsavory than : the Gov- A 

DEMOCRATIC PRECEDENT, The Democratic press manifested an uncalled for anxiety before the election of Sherman as President' of the Senate as towho' ought to be elected to that position, many claiming' that a Repub lican Senate should elect a Democrat, because the people willed at the last election that a democrat should pre side over the Senate," by virtue of his ofiice as Vice President of the United States. As a reason for this unheard of proceedure they claimed that the will of the people would be foiled, if a .re publican should be elected. The Senate done perfectly right in following a democratic precedent. Not iater than for years ago, when Vice President Arthur became President at the death of Garfield, the Senate elect ed a president who would have sue ceeded to Mr. Arthur's ofiice, had he died or been disqualified in any way from discharging the duties- of his of fice; and the Democrats being in a ma jority for a day elected Senator Bay ard to be virtually Vice President of the United States, though the people had only a short time before elected a Republican president by an over whelming majority both popular and electoral. Remembering this incident we cannot understand the logic of the Democracy when it urged the Senate to refrain from electing a Republican lo the ofiice of President of the Senate when the Republican party has a ma jority of eight in that body. To be sure the people expressed their preference a year ago for a Dem ocratic administration by a plurality of 63,983 votes, and as a Republican has been elected President of the Sen ate and were Cleveland to die, there would be a political change in the country not exactly of the peoples' making. But the same thing might have occurred four years ago, when Bayard was President of the Senate, although Garfield and Arthur had been voted in. The Republicans of the Senate were authorize! by precedent to elect a Re publican and they would have been recreant to their constituencies if they had failed to do so, for they represent 'constituencies as well as the adminis tration, and greater constituencies, too, than do the less number of Democrat ic senators.
