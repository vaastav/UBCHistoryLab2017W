? ; *&te Sumter Watchman has by ofany paper publis?ud vii Suinter, # An tu?tier or?oformau'on fot our raa-V , - dera, we give, ?/i ex?en*?, ID OUT precept iuuc, the Annual Message of Gov. SCOTT to the Legislature of the 6tato DOW ?D 80<!8?OO. Its tone is temperate nnd conciliatory, nod in striking contrast with his former State papors. U has previously been , hi? h?bil to ?eise the opportunity winch Buch papers afforded, to abuse and de . noonee the respectability and intelli? gence of the State, the inspiration find? ing existence, no doubt, iu the fact that all that clues of our people ignored and contemned his udmini-tration. And thia action und feeling, on tho part ot' tho people, was inspired aa the very natural result of the course pursued by him as Governor of tho State. The whoie course of his administration, up to thia time, has bcerTin violation oi the feelings and in hostility to the rights .nd iutcrost of all that class of the peo plo. One oluss or raeo was fostered, . petted and upheld, even to a departure from tho spirit aud letter of the law, whilst the other class, which held th0 mass oP the property, and was th source from wbioh the Stute Govern? ment was financially sustniued, was trampled upon aud discriminated aguitist un ail occasious- And, to cul? minate und on tot co this extraordinary . discrimination, arms were placed in the hands of tho favored race and denied to the other. This, more than anvtbiug else, probably, was calculated to excite burning indignation aud bring constant irritation aud collision. The effect of such a oourse, as must have been ex - peoted by Gov. SCOTT, have been to bring the State to the very verge of oivil war And that it did uot, in fact, burst out in every part of tho Stato, was duo en tirely to the forbearance and extraordi? nary putieneo-of the whites. Such a oourso of oppression and discrimination against a particular class, and that the belter olass, in auy State of tho North or West, would have lighted tho fires of civil strife and blood, aud a righteous vengeance- would have been visited upon tho usurper?. But Gov. SCOTT now proposes a dif? ferent course. He promises to be the Governor of all the people, and to know DO class or party in his administration of the Government of tho State. He also culls upon tho people, from the spirit of bis words, to forget the oui* mositics of tho past, and to inculcate peace and harmonious co operation for the general good. He also points out a number of tho abuses of Government as now administered, recommend* ccouomy and retrenchment of taxation, and reform in several special departments. If he be in good earnest, and second his words by aots which carry them forward, to all of this, we doubt not, tho better class will respond, and a day ol more law and order, and peace and harmony aud prosperity may dawn upou tho oom? mouwcalth. In his hands and those ol his party, is tho Government. If IK and they wish pcaco and seek to attain it, peace will no doubt prevail. v/lNT s roo ?t co.?ii',\,n v-A tx i i.i.

HALEIGH, November 29.-At 12 /clock M. to dav, io joint meeting of the Legislature, ex Governor Z. li. Vance was elected United States Sena? tor. The vote Btood-Vaooe, 94; Abbott, 43. Governor Vance was serenaded at bis lodgings this evening, at 6 o'clock, at the Exe li ange Hotel, aod in response to vocif?rons calls from an immenso multitude delivered the following ad dress. Having ju-* prepared to leavo tho city, the address was necessarily short: FELLOW CITIZENS : I hardly know what to say, how much to say, apd how much not to say. I should be either more or less than human if I did not feel grateful to you and the people of North Carolina for many kindnesses. I am unable to account for the kindness of the people in honoring meso often. I know it cannot be for any superior merit of my own. . I oat; onjjy attribute it to one thing. Human nature is a very common thing, and there isa great deal of it in humanity. (Laughter.) A great deal has beon said of tho hypo? crisy of politicians, of the ingratitude of republics : but it is a principio in human nature that the man who serves the people faithfully in any position where that people place him,* be the cause right or wrong, will be honored by them. I must say that I feel that I have done HO. I was reared a Whig ; a I party devoted to the Union ; as a Whig I fought disunion, and stood by the Union even until in thc South general? ly, feeling itself aggrieved, Unionism became very unpopular. I still adhered tu it until my State, in* her sovereign capacity, attempted to' dissever her connection with that Ua>iuD. I then elected to go with my State, uiy kith and kin. I laving joined' the army 1 determined to serve the new eause with the sumo unswerving zeal with which I had served that of the Union. I was called upon to support ao'.s which hud not beforo, and did not then meet my approval for the general good. I served us your Govornorj. I clung with you to the cause, and did not surrender my authority until tho last hungry, ragged Confederate had laid down his arms. Alter thc war terms upon conditions wore held nut to thc people of the South I would not accept terms that would separate me fronfyou and thc brave boys who went at your bidding. Thc longest road hus a tum. I did not wish to rise until I could rise with you. Thank God, that time hus arrived. We go up now. Wo may go down again, but will go down together ; and I will ho ve with mc good company - the best and bravest hearts in thu lund with me. Jiooouse our party han been triumphant there are some who urge retaliation. This should not bc no. Thebes^ antidote fur tyranny, thc strongest weapon against it, itt thc enactment of just and whole* -oine laws. Now that wo havo the government of North Carolina in our hand?, we should not aim to avenge our selves for the overriding of ci vii liberty among us, hut wo should so arrange that it cannot happen again-should sec to it that no executive or other authority cnn nguin attempt to destroy our liberties. From the obtaining ol' Magna Chart.? to tho present Jay no attempt to override or abridgo it hus been made that has not moro firmly rc* established liberty. May it be so here. It is truo that in the Inst five years we have felt what is to bo without trial by jury, to have arrests among ua with* nut warrant, and th? freedom of thc press abridged. All tho people under? stand it now. lt behooves us now to hutld up the great principles of our liberty on the eternal rook of our great country. Let unger, revenge ?nd re tnlintion be ignored, und let the luws on your statute boo'; bear tho impress of a (Vee people, determined legitimately lo maintain their I rc et ru tn- in my pince io tho Senate I fdinll on&envor to serve my gi out State und my country with honor/ That 1 swill ho admitted, tu serve yon scare? ly admits nf a doubt The President's message, it is said, will foreshadow amnesty, and, tho recent elections show tho. h.md writing on thc wall.

C?rrente ?alamo this letter must be written, and it is not difficult to dash off an epistolary morceau Jrotn this ancient capita). For Columbia is now a sweet pluuc- redolent, glossy, and pungent as a nosegay. Spend^a week hero ii you want to get happy. Such a picture of high lifo below stairs you never did see. I can't take timo to write it out, but iu few words for short, I rfu say, as afellow citizen of this great universal sprcad englo society, I never did and never expect to, seo auytbing which eau como pitl.in two miles and a half of such a State Government Show Company. Stick a pia thero, or make a chalk mark, and then read on. Big Bob Graham is to be Judgo of the Charleston Circuit. Glory onough for ono administration-Selah. Moses (the eujd gentleman) it is openly announced, has pot seventy-five thousand dollars into the oanvass for U. S. Senator (O whore did it como from ?) and besides, has pap enough left to merit a oontinuod puffing of himself and son from tho Courier's "ipeoial." Pearce, it is said, is backed by Spraguc, with a still heavier pile. Others are also in the field, and tho highest bid will secure tho highest vote, and olect the U. S. Senator. It is a blessed thing that the most of the members hnv'nt brains enough to run tho risk of insani? ty-or such audden wealth you know, ko. In considering the etute of the country this week, members of the 'Ouso made most violent speeches. To hear them, cue would suppose that nothing but blood and brimstone would satisfy thom. They may punch up thc lion too much, even if they have him iu chains. Joe Crews and his campaign in Lau? rens are notable in thc record of the week. With a large force of infantry, cavalry and artillery, he succeeded (what a constable or sheriff alone could have done) io in resting and bringing here some twelve of the prominent oiti* aens of that county, on trumped up charge?. The; were bailed out, but ut once were re arrested on charges made by Hubbard, and some of them arc still iu jail. Tlte effort sectus to bc. whether they cun't possibly force or kick the up country ?uto a fight. Whilletuure, the saintly, has a Bill to stop the Ku Kluxing, by levying a heavy special tax on "thc real estate" of any county where rt is practiced. Nothing lu the Bill to stop negroes burning barns, by taxing eery black mah where- such outrages occur. Thc party, yuu know, only legislates in fa* vor of one side.
