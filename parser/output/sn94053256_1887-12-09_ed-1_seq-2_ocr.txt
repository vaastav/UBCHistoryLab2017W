Entered at the Post Office at Waterbury, Conn, as second class matter. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 9, 1887. BLAINE'S BOLD BID. We had, in our juvenility and innocence, bui posed that European travel would tend to an expansion of thought that inter course with new peoples would serve to re move old prejudices, and that a bigoted political policy professed here for a pur pose would yield to. the enlightenment of the growth of ages abroad. Well,yes, we had thought that the plumed knight of Maine would, like Russell Lowell, believe in Freedom's name As far away as Paris is. And that in time he would come back to us with his great mind unencumbered by restricted notions of popular right and his acknowledged statesmanship liberated from partisan shackles. But no, the Ethiope's color is unchanged; and in the salons of the French capital he is just as intolerant of progress as when addressing his Republi can neighbors at Augusta or swinging round the circle in his campaign for the Presidency. When the first telegraphic summary of Mr Blaine's criticism on President Cleve land's message reached us, we confess to have entertained the idea that it was an enterprising invention of some needy French Reporter. We have high estimate of Mr Blaine's qualities as a gentleman, and we could hardly believe that with the at tributes and instincts of the character he would precipitately descend to make a bid for a prospective 'dead man's shoes;' we be lieve Mm to be a man of literary .eulture and refinement and - hesitated credence to . the- want of delicacy involved in his re ported pronouncement on the President's reform policy. We thought that having stood three years ago as the rival candidate to the great man who was selected as ruler of the United States and, if all signs of the times indicate truly, is anxious to stand in the same relations again he would,in the delicacy we have suggest ed, refrain from a pronounced antago nism and reserve his strictures for the time when, if he get the opportunity he should stand on the same broad platform of open rivalry. But then? a nomination would be a pre-requisite to such an oppor tunity; and he anticipates the opportunity by a bold bid for the pre-requisite. It is not our desire or design to follow the parripatetic Mr Blaine through the in tricacies of his political platitudes in reply to the President. The statements are of the old reckless standard, the arguments of the stamp that have sought to justify mon opoly, and uphold corruption and crush the people through all the years of Repub lican misrule. Mr Blaine in this attidude merely plays a part to subserve his own ambition, for he is too acute a man not to know that America cannot remain in the old groove of party assumption while the Nations 6f the world step in on the march of progress. Mr Blaine puts in an opposition to Mr Cleveland's proposition. Not that he does not believe in their propriety, but that it is the only recommendation he now possesses to the favor of the cliques that would suffer by their enforcement. It is a lamentable thing when a great intelli gence will lower itself before selfish aspir ations: when what should be an ardent patriotism yields to the miserable demands of party ascendancy. Mr Blaine's time for criticism was ill-chosen; his style un warranted and unjust; the people of this country are keen enough in the aggregate to distinguish between the ruler who pro motes reform and the would-be ruler who would cling j.tne oia - J tion will estimate' the object of Blaine's Bold Bid. How the alliterative points come in ! The three R's Rum, Romanism and Rebellion of a reverend advocate contributed in no small degree to the de feat of 1884, and now the three little B's Blaine's Bold Bid will operate, if we mis take not, against his nomination in Con vention. A, 

WORD IN SEASON. It is glorious weather as we write, this afternoon. The air is crisp, not "eager and nipping;" and the sun is bright and warm. Overhead it is pleasant, and under foot dry; even the crossing are passable and the sida-walks without unsightly mud heaps. All this is very enjoyable, and we are thankful for the favors which Heaven gives. But a day is coming is not far off may be with us to-morrow or any time, when as a compensation for the loss of celestial favors now, we shall have to look to mundane influences, to the power of municipal authority; and more, the will and determination to exercise that power. Frost will be here anon indeed, is here at present and the effect is to accelerate the pulse and give vigor to the step of the mul titude. All right. But what about the snow? The "Beautiful Snow" as long as it lasts is a God-send to those who, muffled in furs, can disport themselves behind the musical tinklings of the sleigh bells, and return to their luxurious homes refreshed and re-invigorated. The snow, however, will degenerate into slush; the mud in street and on pathway will become thick and slab; the crossings, that used to be, will be invisible in their filthy coatings, and pedes trians the people of business who do not possess sleighs and cannot afford to" pay for carriage hirewill have to wade morn ing, noon and night through seas of that same slush and mountains of that same mud, not only to their positive discom fort, but to the danger of disease and death. . - -'.I Now our word in season is that the Boards or Councils or Commi.slonex'3 or whatever you pleeie to de?inrte the vari ous bodies charged with conservation of the City's comforts should take time by the forelock and prepare for the time that will come whether they be prepared or not. If' there be City Ordinance8 for the cleaning of our thoroughfares let them be enforced at any cost; if not, let powers be sought in that direction and for that TrarDose. we should like to see a broom brigade daily in operation and carts occasionally at work to take away the gath ered street sweepings. We would rejoice in the enforcement of a rule or if not exist ing an ordinance therefor by which resi dents in private house or public store should be called upjpn to keep their front ages respectively clear of snow and accu mulated mud. And in especial manner it would be more acceptable to us to see the crossings so that persons might cross in safety. In the last named matter, in. other cities, house and store keepers have be come a power unto themselves: if authority does not act for them they find it to their profit to keep the crossings to their premi ses clean. This word in season or rather anticipative of the season, is worth think ing about. How public boards protect public inter ests is sometimes exemplified in not very praiseworthy directions. The matter of bids and contracts for City purposes is made a mockery; and competition is pre vented by a fore knowledge of favoritism, Our local contemporary, the "Republi can," mildly charges that: "A meeting of the Fire Commissioners was called for last night, but only the Mayor and Commis sioner Roberts appeared,and they adjourned subiect to the call of the Mayor." Just ao. The meeting was for the award of con tracts. Last year for similar purposes the contract was awarded to the "highest bidder" without any alle oration iustifvina ..the selection. This year there was no bidder but the contrac tor of last jetT the other contestants deaminsr it a waste of time and labor to compete; and on this reason Mr Commis sioner Kelly justifies his absence from last night's meeting, and authorizes us to state so. Perhaps the Commissioners generally not only of the Fire Department but of all others within municipal jurisdiction would take to thought the fact that they are appointed to protect public interests and conserve publio funds and not to favor bv exceptional preferences individual friends. We find a pamphlet on our desk entitled "The Book of Books." with various sub titles, by Professor Nathaniel N. Pearce It treats on the cleansing of the blood and the cure of all diseases, external and inter nal. bv the simple use of hot water. The Cold Water Cure of Claridge had its day, and there are various Hydropathic estab lishments still scattered over the world but hot water ij a new suggestion. From cancer to chilblain no reference to our friend Blame oi teat ilk, tnougn tnere is hot water enough in store for him from rickets to rheumatism from biliousness to bunions and from corns to consumption hot water is the universal prescription Nothing else will be effective, for any pur pose but po.'soning. Doctors and drugs pills and potions, bleeding and blistering are all abominations. Hot Water is the grand specific, and of this, goodness knows many people have more than enough. The little book, however, has a merit that is not claimed for it. Mirth is acknowledged to be a medicine in itself and there are few who can resist the provocative to mirth contained in the "Professor's" war of extermination asrainst tlie "varmint" cat and the filthy dog. The annual report of the New York,New Haven and Hartford railroad, which has just been issued shows that corporation to be in a highly prosperous condition. Al though $672,582 has been spent in the past year in improvements, principally in lay ing four tracks, a dividend of 10 per cent. can be paid, and there will still be cash as sets amounting to $2,719,160. The report describes in detail the different improve ments under way and proposal. The four tracks will be completed to Portchester early in the spring. The block system of signaling trains is being introduced on the New York division, and will be in opera tion in a few weeks. This will greatly re duce the liability of accidents. Grade crossings are to be abolished at twenty-two places in Connecticut, and the same work is being pushed in New York State. There nas been a large increase or tne passenger traffic during the past year, and the cars at present in operation have been found to be entirely inadequate for the business, and a large number of new coaches have been ordered. ' x hat jjemocratic JJuty, or wnicn we wrote yesterday, impresses us the more the more we think of it Our party owes it to itself to stand together in unity of thought and unity of action ln respect of the ap proachmg appointments by the City Fathers. The pressure from without is ever a potent factor in political matters and if constituents insist representatives must obey. The Aldermen and Council lors of the Republican party admittedly majority in both Chambers have the oppor portunity of graceful concession to Demo cratic claims; if they do not seize it, then the representatives of the other side could so act in concert as to lead to an obstruc tion promotive of a dead-lock. We should not like to see this. Mutual consideration and fair play all round is what the citizens want. We .welcome a reform indicating general interests in national affairs let us not cultivate the old grudge in City mat ters. . - " ' Mb Blaine wants a special organ in the West. It was somewhat confidently stated m Washington last night that the defeated of 1884 and the aspirant for 1888, through his friend, Mr Stephen B. Elkins, is behind the movement for securing the Chicago Times," the des'gn being to make it the leading Republican protection organ of the noi ihwest, and, of course, an advocate of the election of Mr Blaine to the.presidency next year. It won't do, Sir Knight. There is a counteracting power not to be over looked; particularly as it exists in the Re publican household. The "Tribune," Mr Medilt's paper, while friendly to Mr Blaine is yet a low tariff cnampion, ana to tne surprise of "Republicans has come out in unequivocal indorsement of the princi ples laid down in the President's message, and recommends their adoption by its par ty in Congress. The New York "8tar" suggests that the Republican conclusion to hold a National Convention in Chicago strengthens the ar gument for a Democratic Convention in the Empire City. Our contemporary adds: "Let us avoid the inconvenience of having two party platforms bearing the same me, and at the same time reach the ad vantages that can be gained in no other way than by holding the grand council of THE
