We regret to wie such heated rontro between the two leading South journals, the Times-Democrat and the Picayune, growing out of the guber natorial contest in Louisiana. The dan gers in Buch ?. contest is that ever a!te* the question they are discussing is settled by the people, they may have antago nized each other to sucli an extent that a reconciliation wdhld hardly be possi ble. This would be a matter of deep re gret to the friends and readers of these excellent papers and it is to be hoped that both the Times-Democrat and the Picayune will be governed by a little bij more moderation. They should not impair their usefulness by thrusting one another. The party has need for both papers. versca era Says the New York Tribune of Thiirs day, last, y ung man rushed wildly about the I en isylvania railroad depot in Jersey City yesterday morning, looking for a ( police officer. He said that he was from Natchez, Miss., that his name was Chamhless, and that he had been swin dled by a "bunco steerer" out of $3 50. He did not care for the money, he said ; the experience was worth it, hut he wanted to have the thief arrested. The thief was an old man with white hair and an honest look. He had offered to show the young man a house he was looking for. Cbambless lent him $3 50. to pay another man,who presented a bill to him, until he could get a check cashed. The last he saw of the honest old man he was running rapidly around a corner two blocks away." The Illinois Ventral Rond Mnbienbes 929,000 to the Stock of the Vhnl mette Hotel, The new hotel project is receiving more encouragement than was expected by the most sanguine friends of the en terprise. Entirely unsolicited, Mr. 8. B. McConnico, the President of the Chal mette Hotel Company, yesterday receiv ed a subscription of $25,000 to the capi tal stock. Mr. J. C. Clarke, President of the Illinois Central Railroad, was the subscriber on behalf of his company, and in a letter addressed to Mr. McCon nico he says that "he has long been greatly impressed witli the importance I of having a first-class hotel in New Or leans, and believes that such a measure | would turn a large proportion of Geor gia and Florida excursionists and tour ists to this city. The great objection of lack of hotel accommodations; and, al though this city presented many more attractions than either Georgia or Flori da, the later States were made the ob jective point of travelers in preference to New Orleans." If the other four combinations or com exas, the pantes, the Louisiana and Texas and Pacific, the Louisville and Nashville and the Northeastern, will do as Mr. Clarke has done, $125,000 of the stock of the hotel company will be sub scribed for, and this in itself would be • an assurance that the work would go rap idly forward to completion. Sir. McConnico, who is very enthusi astic in the good work, visited some of the railroad magnates yesterday, and will see them all in the course of a few days.—Times-Democrat.

PRESIDENT'S JEESMAUE. The President's Message is conserva tive in tone and moderate in temper, and while it contains no very great evi dence of profound statesmanship, it cornes up perhaps fully to the require ment and embraces in the main about all the occasion calls for. It is a pleas ure to know that our internal affairs are prosperous and quiet, and that our rela tions with foreign countriesis satisfacto ry. His views are in harmony with those of the Secretary of the Treasury on financial questions. The President is opposed to the rapid, reduction of the public debt through excessive taxa tion. He rather favors the using of the surplus amounting to $60,000,000 annually, to improving our coaBt defen ses and to strengthening our Navy. He shows a disposition somewhat to avoid a renewed agitation of the tariff question, which appears to us to be dodging one of the leading questions of the day. Our Navy needs improving and our com merce on the Bea must be protected, but the reduction of taxes is a vital question to the people, and they are not likely to forego their interest in it. The revenue system ought to be adjusted to the re quirements of government only, and no large surplus ought to be laid up to in cite our law makers and officials to cu pidity. The President's views in regard to the U tab question seems to us to he most too extreme. To abolish the Ter ritorial government and to assume abso lute political control of the Territory, by Congress, is a most radical measure, as it would take away from the people of Utah ,,n 8e mblance of local self government, , enforcem6nt of lawg into the F y , , ^ . hands of men hostile to a large majority 0 f its people. The practice of polygamy ig in our opinion, vile and a just object such extreme measures. The govern ment control of the telegraph is a matter f doubt in thft p res ident's mind, but his ,, ._ , suggestion that there should he gov era ment supervision of both telegraph and ra ilroad inter-state communication, is botb ti me ly and wise. States can protect themselves within their borders,but they need force and utility that will extend beyond their boundaries. The President speaks favorably of the new civil service system, but on the question of civil rights, he seems to think that the citizens not sufficiently protected by the na tional power. He recommends heartily the World's Industrial and Cotton Cen tennial Exposition at New Orleans next year, and for which he should have our thanks. ;in' Wonderful Performing Stallion*. In W. W. Cole's New Consolidated Shows one finds every recollection of all the circuses ho has ever seen, reproduc ed with new effects, and supplemented with a perfectly bewildering array of novelties. No person can fail to observe those equine wonders, the $50,000 troupe of Royal Performing Stallions, all in the ring simultaneously. These beautiful creatures were imported solely for Cole s shows, and there is no limit to the ad miration and delight which they excite whenever and wherever thev appear. Their act is wholly unlike anything else ever attempted. PIH* WHMKira. The Extensive EstsWIshwsewl * ew er A. Vi For many years Memphis has had enviable reputation for the extent of its liquor trade, and the quality of goods produced or handled. Buyers can al ways find here superior inducements in the way of the finest brands, fair treat ment, and reasonable prices, and, as a consequence, the direct trade with the leading dealers throughout the country constantly increasing. * The amount of capital invested in the business is very large, and those engaged in it are push ing their interests with intelligent enter prise. The character of her whisky men has also largely contributed to her preeminence in this trade. In all that goes to make up a body of honorable, high-toned merchants, they will compare favorably with any in the United States. Their representations can be at all times implicitly relied upon, and those who deal with them once are sure to do so again. Among the most extensive and reputable wholesale dealers of Memphis stands the firm of an A. 

VACCABO A CO., No. 278 and 280 Front Street, established in 1844. In all their years of active bus iness operations, it has been a J principle of the house to merit and retain the con fidence ot the public and of the trade. How well they have succeeded, their in creasing trade and circle of friends best attests. Their transactions aggregate very largely each year, and complaints from customers are almost unheard of. The house of A. Vaccaro & Co., is well known to the trade at large, and their reputation is in keeping with the high standard of the goods they handle. There is nothing iri President Arthur's credible to his adminis message more . tration than his hearty recomendation oi the World's Industrial and Cotton Centenial Exposition at New Orleans next year. For this and his cordially expressed sympathy for the movement for the improvement of the Mississippi River in a previous message, he is enti tled to the gratitude of the people of the Mississippi Valley.—Nashville Ameri can, Dem. — ^ aie imormeu uy a triend that a calf was born on Mrs. Fountain's farm lastTuesday, eight miles southwest of Forest, having a double body—the growing together from throat to abdo domen with backs outward.
