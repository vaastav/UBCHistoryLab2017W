A UOt nndemtood that the rniidlltnn of th. In. J"tectlon in Cuba han materially changed nlncc .he clono of tho lant sewion of Oonnreen. In an early alaee of the contest, the authorities of Spain InanKurated a nynteni of arbitrary arrcnte. of cloeo roiiilnement, of military trial and execution of persons mmpectecioi complicity with the insurgents, " ?f. ''"""mr,v embarco of their properties and reqnii.tl,in of tuelr reveuuen by executive warrant. Huch procendinjm, no f.ir as thev affected the ,er aonn or property of citizens1 of "the United States, were lu violation of the provisions of the treaty of lT.-, between tho 1'iiitcd Slates and Spaim Representations of injuries resulting to several persons claiming to lie citizens of the I nited States, by reason of such violations, were made to the Spanish kovenmicnt. Krom April, to June last, the Sjiaiush Minister at Washington had been clothed with a limited power to act lu redressing auch wronirs. That power wan found to be with drawn, in view, it was eald, of the warlike situa tion in which the Island of Cuba then was, which, however, did not lead to a revocation or suspen sion of the extraordinary and arbitrary functions xerclsed by the executive power in C uba, and we were obliged to make our complaint at Madrid. In tho negotiation thus opened and still ponding there, the United States only claimed that for the . future the rights secured to their citizens by treaty should bo respected in Cuba, and that as to tho vast a Joint tribunal should lie established in the l ulled States, with full Jurisdiction over all such claims. Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be required to prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would beat lilmny to isnv. erse every material fact, and thus complete equity would be done. A case which at one time threat ened to seriously atlVct the relations lietweeu the I'nitcd States anil Spain has already been disposed of in this way. The claim of the Col. Lloyd Aspln wall. for tho illegal seizure and detention of that ' vessel was referred to arbitration by mutual con- - consent, and has resulted in an award to the United Stales for the owners of the same of fisi.7ir2.r(l in i;old. Another and long pending claim of like na ture, that of the whaleslnp Canada, has been dis posed of by frloudly arbitration during the present vcar. It was referred by tho joint consent of I lirazil and the United States to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, her Jlritnnlc Majesty's Minis ter at Washington, who kindly undertook the la borious task of examining tho voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony submitted by the two fr.Aeriiinents, and awarded to the I'tilted . states the sum of tl(l.7l "(l in gold, which bus eince been paid by the imperial government. These recent examples show that the mode which the United States have proposed to Spain for nd- . justing the pending claims is Just and feasible, and that It may tie agreed to by either nation without . dishonor. It Is to lie hoped that tlds moderate demand may be acceded to. by Spain without further delay. Shonld the pending negotiations unfortunately and unexpectedly be without result, It will then be come my duty to communicate that fact to Congress and Invito Its action on the subject. 

SPA1K AND TUB SOUTH AMERICAN HF.Pl!Bl.If'S. The long deferred peace conference between Spain andtho allied South American republics '. han hen inaaguratcd In Washington, tinder the auspices of the United States, pursuant to the recommendation contained in the resolution of ' the House of Representatives of the 17lh of Tie ruiuner, WW. Tho Executive Department of tho , (jovernmeut Offered Its friendly olHces for the promotion of peace and harmony lietwcen Spain f and the Allied republic Hesitations and obstacles occurred to the acceptance of the otter. Ultimately, however, a conference was arranged and w as opened In this city on the tilth of October last, at which I authorized the Secretary of State to preside. It was attended by the Ministers of Spain, Peru, Chill and Kcuador. In consequence of the absence pf a representative from Bolivia, the conference was Adjourned uutil the attendance of a plenipoten tiary from that republic could be secured, or other measures could be adopted toward compassing Its oHect. The allied and other republics of Spanish origin on this continent may see in this fact a new proof of our sincere interest In their welfare; of our desire "' to see them blessed w ith good governments capable of maintaining order and preserving their respect ive territorial lutogrlty, and of our sincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relalious with them. Tie time is probabjy not far distant when, in the course of natural events, the Kuro. pcan political connection with thin continent will cease. Our policy should be shaped in view of this probability, no as to ally the commercial Interests of the Ppaulsh American States more closely to tj our own, and thus give tho United States all the "pre-eminence and all the advantage which Mr. ilonroe, Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay contemplated when the; proposed to join the. Congress of Panama. SAN 

DOMINGO. ' f ! Turing the last session of Congress, a treaty ' the annexation of the Republic of Ban Domingo to the United States fnllert to receive the requisite tw-tblrdn rou of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of the coun try, commercially and materially, demanded its ratification, Time han only continued me in thin view. I novr firmly believe that the moment It is known that the United Stutes have entirely aban doned the project of accepting as a part of tt. ter- 'ritus?y tli.'lslaud of Ran Domingo, a frco port will ha negotiated for by . Kuropcan nations, In . the Hay of fiainan. A large eonnncrclal city will spring up, to which we will lie tributary, without. rnci,ivlii!? corrpstiondhiir benefits.

It possesses tli richest soil, tho best and most capacious harbors, the most salu ," . brlous climate, and the most valuable products of ' the forest, mine and soil of any of the West India Islands. Its possession by the United Stales will In ' a few years hullil up a coastwise commerce of im mense magnitude, which will go lar toward nytoc lug to the United Stales our lost merchant marine. ., It Mill give to us those artlclos which wo cousinae greatly and do not produce, thus equalizing our ex p irts and tuii.irts. In case of a foreign war, It will rive its command of all the islands referred to, and lifts .prevcut an enemy from agniu possessing himself of a rendezvous npou our coast.

It Is the obvious Interest, especially of neigh boring nations, to nrovi.le against iiiii'irv to thoie w ho may have committed high crimes within their oomers, ana who mav nave sought retugo abroad. For this purpose extradition treaties have been concluded w ith several of the Central American Republics, and others are in progress. VENKEirLA. The sense of Congress is desired, as early an may be convenient, npou tho proceedings of the Commission on Claims against Venezuela, as rnntiunntcnted in tho messages of March 4th, Iftili, March 1st, lsiu and March 81st, 1870. It has ntd been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money w hich lias been received from that government until Cuiigrc8 shall have acted upon the THE CHINESE MASSACRES. The massacres of French and Russian residents at Tien-Tsin under clrcumstnuces of great bar barity were supposed by some to have been pre meditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese empire. The evidence fulls to establish such a supposition, hut shows a complicity bv the local authorities and tho mob. The government at I'ekin, however, seems to have been disposed to fuliill p. treaty obligations, so far an it was able to do so. Unfortiiuntely the news ot the war between tho German States aud France reached China noon after the massacre. It would appear that the popular mind became possessed with the Idea that this contest, extending to Chi nese waters, would neutralize the Christian InHu- cine and power, and that the time wan coming wiien tne superstitious mass might expel all for eigners and restore the mandarin influence. Antici pating trouble from this cause. I Invited France and ,orth Germany to make an authorized sus pension or hostilities in the East, w here they were temporarily suspended by act of "the conimauders, to act together for the future protection in China of the lives aud property of Americans and Europeans. 

TREATY WITH ENGLAND. Since the adioliriiinetit of I'onirrosn. the PAtlrlrA- tious of the treaty with Great Britain for abolish ing the mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade, have been exchanged.

THE BRITISH BOUNDARY LINE. In April last, while eugaged in locating a military reservation near l'cmlilna. a corps of en gineers discovered mat liie commonly reccivcu Miuniliirv line lietwcen the United Stales aud the Briiish possessions at that place, is about fifty-sev en hundred feet south of the truo position of the zenith parallel, and that the line w hen run on wnai is now supposed to be the true position of that par allel, would leave the fort of the Hudson's bay company at retnniiia wiiuin tuo territory ot me L nited states. Tina information ocing communi cated to the Britlh government, I was requested to consent, and 1 did consent, that the British occupa tion of the fort of the Hudson's Bay Co. shottld continue for the present. I deem it important, however, that this part of the boundary linen should lie definitely fixed by a joint commission of the governments, and submit herewith esliiuatee of tho exjiense of such a commission on the part of the United States, and recommend an appropriation for that ptirMise.

I regret to sav that no conclusion has been reach ed for the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain, growing out 01 tne course aoopu-u ny tout government during the rebellion. The Cabinet of ijuirlofi. wo f:ir iis its vievs have been expressed. does not appear to be willing to concede that her .Majesty's gmernmeut was guilty of negligence, or did or permflted any act during the war by which the United States has just cause of complaint. Ever firm and unalterable, its convictions are directly the reverse. I. therefore, recomineud to congress to uufhorize the uppointuieut of a Commission to take pr.ioi ol ine amotiui ami n.e owuersnip, ami press their claims ou the notice of the representa tives of ler Majesty at Washington, and that au Ihor ne given for the settlement of these claims by toe United States, so that the government shull have the ownership or the private claims as well as the responsible control of all the demands against Ureal brnani. It cannot he necessary to add that whenever her Maiestv's government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims, the United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the uouor and dignity of both nations. THE FISHING QUESTION. The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of the United States during tho past season baa lot been marked by a friendly feeling. Ky the tlrst article or the Convention of IhIR lietwcen Great Britain ami the United States, it was a' 'reed thathe inhabitants of the United States should have forever, in com mon with British subjects, the right of taking fink in certain waters therein defined. In the waters not Included in tho limits named iu the Convention, within three nillea of ports of the British coast, it has been the custom for many years lo give Intruding fishermen of the United Slates A reasoimble warning of ttie viola tion of the technical rights of tireat Britain. 1 lie luiierial government is understood to have dele gated to whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these Inshore flattery grounds to the Colonial authority, known as tho Dominion of Can ada, and this pcnii-lndcitendent hut Irresponsible Agent has exercised the delegated powers in an un friendly way. Vessels have been seized without noilce or warning in violation of tho custom pre viously prevailing, and have been takuu iulo the colonial ports, tuelr voyaccs broken up and the vessels condemned. 1 trre 1s reason to helievo that this unfruuilly und vexatious treatment was do signed to liear harshly upon tlie hardy Usher- men ot tne i uiteu states, with a view of noliiimd effect upon this itoverumeiiL The statutes of the Dominion of C'auada assume a Mill broader aud more uiiteiiablu lurlsdicth over tho vessels of the United Stales. They auinorize oiucers or person. 10 oriug vessels nov eriug w ithin three marine miles of any of ih. cousin, bays, creeks or harlsirs of Canada, Into port, to search the cargo, to examine tlie master, on oath, touchiuL' the cargo aud voyage, and to inllict iinou iiim a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answereare not given, anil if such a vessel Is found preparing to -fish withiii three marine miles of any such coasts, bavs, creeks or lurbors without a Ih ouse, or after the expiration of the period named In the last license granted to It, tlioy pstijIdetliAt the ves. nel, with her tackle, etc., etci,! Mtorreltcd. It Is not kuowe that any condemnations have been made under ibis statute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, It will become my duty to tuko such steps as may 1st necessary to protect the rights or citizens or ma culled states. iiiicti mates, oillcers that If bus been claimed hy Her Miijesiy's oillcon the Ashing vessels 01 the cuiieii status nnve bo right 10 enter the open ports of the Hrilisb pos sessions in Norlh America, except for the purposes of shelter aud repairing damage., of purchasing wood and ohiuiniug water ; that lby have no right to ent.r at the Briiish custom house, or 10 trade, except for the purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart williln tit hours after notice to leave. 11 l not known that any selaure of a isliltig ves sel carrying the flag of the lulled Slate, has been made uiuler this claim. So far as tbe claim U founded ou th" alleged construction of the Con vention of 1m8, It cannot lie acquiesced In by the ( lilted Stutes.. lt)s hoped that It will not lie In sisted 011 by Her Majesty's Govornuient. llurlng the cuilercniw which preceded tlie negollailoii of the Convention of lain, the Hilil-h coinuilsslon.rs proposed to expressly exclude the llsh.riueu of (lie I idled stales f.oii (he privilege ol carrjlug ou trade wiih any of Ills llrlilaiilc M'desly's euhjcsia r.siiliui' Htil.ii the limits lisrlu I for liielr use. and also that It should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States eugaged tu such fishery lo have on board any foods, wares or uierchauulxe what ever, except such a may be necessary for tii. prorecuilmi of their voyages to And from said fin Ling grounds, and an 7 vstsvl of the United Stales, which shall contravene this regulation, may lie seized, condemned and courts cated. with her enriro.

If, however. It be said that this claim Is founded on provincial or colonial ntntulen, and not npon the convention, thin government can not but regard them as unfrloiidly, and In contravention of the spirit. If nut of h. letlor of the treaty, for the faithful execution of men me imperial government In alone responsi ble. Anticipating that an attempt may possibly lie mado by the Canadian authorities. In tho coming season to reiioat their nunelghborly act toward our fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon tho Executive tho power to suspend, by proclamation, the oiwrntlon of the lawn authorizing the transit of f roods, ware, and merchandise In bond, across he territory of tho nited States to Cauatla; and further, should such an extreme measure lie cotne necessary, to susieud the operation of any law whereby the vcssols of tho Dominion of Canada are permitted to eulor tho waters of the United States. NAVIGATION OF THE ST. LAWRENCE. A liko unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the part of Canada irf the nialuteuauco of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the United States from navigation of the St. Lawrence. Thin river constitutes a nat ural outlet to the ocean for eight Htatea, w ith an aggregate population of seventeen million six hun dred thous ml Inhabitants, and with an aggreirBte tonnage of flil.niif tons, upon the wafers which discharge into it. The foreign commerce of their ports on these waters Is open to British comiie Illlon and the major part of II Is done In British bottoms, ir the American noaiueu be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean, the mnium. oly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with tho Atlantic would be in foreign hands, their ves sels on the triins-Atlantlcvovaccs having an access to onr lake ports, which would bo denied to Aincricau vessels on similar voyages. To state such a proposition in to 'refute its jus tice. During tho administration of Mr. John Ouincy Adams. Mr. Clav umities- tlonably demonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United State, to tho navigation of the river, claiming; that the act of the Congress of Vienna in opening the lthlue and othor rivers to all nations, showed the judgment of European Jurists and statesmen, that the Inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river misses have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river, to and into the sea. even though passing through tho territory of another power. This rlirht does not exclude the co-equal right of the sovereign posses sing the territory through which the river debonches Into the sea, to make such regulations relative to the policy of the navigation on mav he reasonably necessary. But those refutations should bo framed in a lllsjral spirit of comity, and should Impose no needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right of transit. It has been found In practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mu tual agreement. The United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to tho nav igation of the St. Lawrence w hich mav be suggested by Great Itrilalu. If the claim mode hv Mr. t lav w as .pen w ui-ii me itupiiianou oi tuo niaies oontering ou the shores of the lokes was only 8,4lUMi, it now derives greater rorce and equity from tho Increased ion. wealth, production and lonuaire. of the Stales on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clav advanced his areument in behntf of our right, the principles for which hofontended have been frequently and by varioun nations rec ognized by law or by treaty, and have been extended to several other L'reat rivers. Itv the treatv roiiclnd. ed at Mayence lu 1831. the Khiiie was declared free from the point w here it in flmt navigable Into the sea. I!y the convention bet ween Spain and Portugal, concluded, in ls.15 the navigation of the Dourse throughout its whole extent wan made free fop the subjects of both crowns. In JS53 Hie Argentine confederation, hy treaty, threw open tbe free nav igation of the Parana mid Uragnay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In leSfl the Crimean war was cloned by a treaty which nrovided for the free navigation of the Danube. In imSH Bolivia, by treaty, declared It regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, In accordance with fixed principles of national law, as highways or channels opened by nature for the1 commerce of all nations. In IMS the Paraguay was made free hy treaty, and in Decemlwr. lsiiti, the Emperor of Brazil, by Inqierial decree, declared the Amazon to be open to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant shins of all nations. The irrcatest llvlntr British anthorltv on thin nnb. iect. whilo ansertlng tho abstract right of the Brit ish clulni. savs it seeuis difficult to deny that Great Itritain may ''round her refusal unon strict law. But it is equally difficult to deny, first, that In so doli!she exercises harshly au extreme and hard law; second, that her conduct with respect to the javigatioti of tlie St. Lawrence is lu glaring and liscreditalile inconsistency with tier conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi on the grroiyid that sK imvssi a small doi""" fp ,v-M,-t. file Mississippi took lis rise. Sue Insisted on The right to navigate the entire volume or Its waters, on the ground that she posessee both banks of tho St. Lawrence w here it dlsetnbonches Itself into the sea. She denies to the United States the rir-'ht of naviga tion, though alaiut oue half the waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron and Superior aud the wholo of Ijike Michigan, through which the river flows. are the property or the Lnited states. The whole nation is Interested in securing cheap trausiortatlon from the agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic seaboard. To the citizens of those States It secures a greater return for their lalmr. To Lhe iuliaiiitants of tlie seaboard it offers cheaper food ; to the nation an Increase In the an nual surplus ot wcaltn. It in nopeu mav ine uov cnimcnt of Great Britain will see tho justice of abandoning tlie narrow aud inconsistent claim to which her Cauudiau provinces have urged her adherence. OCEAN NAVIGATION. Onr deDrrnsed commerce is a subject to which I called your special attention at the last ses sion, and suggested that we will In tho future have 10 took more to the countries souui 01 us, auu 10 China and Japan, for lis revlval.- Our representatives to all these Governments have exerted their Influence to encourage trade between the United States ami the countries to which they arj; accredited; but the fact exists that the carrying is done almost entirely In foreign bottoms; and while this stale of aft'airs exists we cannot control our due shure uf the commerce of the world. That between the I'ai Hie States and China aud Japaii is alMiut all the carrying trade now conducted In American vessels. '1 would recoinmeud a literal IMillcy toward that lino of American steamers: one thai will insure iu success and even increased use fulness. Tlie cost of building Iron vessels, the only ones that can compete with foreign ships In the carrying trade, Is so much greater In the United Suites than In foreign countries that, without some assistance from the Government, they cannot be successfully built here. There will be several propositions laid before Congress lu the course of the present ses sion looking to a remedy for this evil. Even If it should he at some cost to the National Treasury, 1 hopo such encouragement will bo given as will se cure American shinning on the high seas, aud American snip-building at home. 

BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENT OF STATE. Department of State calls for the early action of Congrens. Tho ImildliiK tvw routed by that Department is A frail structure at best, and an Inconvenient distance from the Execu tive Mansion and from the other Departments. It is Ill-adapted to the purposes for which It In used, han not capacity to accommodate the archives, and Is not fire-proof. Its remote situation. Its slender construction, and the absence of a supply of water lu tho neighborhood, leaves but little dope of safe ty for either building or Its contents In case of the accident of -a lire. Its destruction would Involve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Conc'rcse. of the historic records of the revolution, of the confederation of the whole series of diplomatic and cousular archives since the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many nihnr vnlunhln records and tiaoers left with that de partment when it was tlie principal depository of tne i.ovemmeni arcnives. 1 rccouuiicuuini appro prialion for the construction of a building for the Department or stat.

Tho estimates for the expenses of the Government ror tlie.

CURRENCY, GOLD AND TAXES. The averuee value of gold as national currency for tho wholo of the year 1WI1I was 1:14, ami for eleven moiillis of 1X70 the same relative value has been about 115. The approach to 0 snecie liasla in verv eratlfvlnff. but the fact cannot be denied I hat instability of tho value of our currency la prejudicial to our prosperity, and tends to keep up price to the dctrlmcBt of trade. The evils of a depreciated and fluctuating currency Are so great that, now, when tho premium ou gold bus luucn so muc.u, 11 would seem mat tne nine lias ar- plvHil when hv wise mid ornilent ti'lsliLI tmi (ion. grcse should look to a policy whicli would plac our currency at pnr wllli gold at no distant day. Tho tin collected from the people bos been reduced mure than n,0mUM.l per annum. By steadiness in onr present course, there Is no reason why In a few abort years the national tax-gaineror may noi nis npiicur from tho door of the citizen almost u llr,.lv Willi the revenue stamp dispensed by postmasters lu every community, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and tobacco lu all Its forms, aud by a wine adjust mpiit of the tartlf. which will nut a dntv only upon those artkiee which we could dispense with, known as Injuries, and on those which w use meroof than we producey revenue enough may be ruie4 after a tew years or peace auq consequent renucuou 01 111 debteduess, to fulllll all our obligations; and I fiisrhep reduction of exumises In addition to a re iliiriloii of Interest account may be relied 011 to liuiku this pru llcaute.

As soon as tho revenue can be dispensed with all duty should be removed from coll'ee. tea, and othor arllclea of universal use not produced by ourselves. . The necessities of tlie country com pel ns to collect tovenuo from our lmportn. An nrmy of assessors and collectors Is not a plca-nt sight to the citizens, hut that or a tariff for revenue Is necessary. Such a tariff, so far as It acts in en couragement to homo products, affords employ ment to lalHir at living wages In contrast 10 the pauper labor of the old world, and also lu the de velopment of home resources. Under the act of Congress of tlie 15lh day of Jury, tho army has grndually been reduced, no thai on the first day of January, 1871, the nnmlier of commissioned officers and men In all will not exceed tho number con templAted by that law. DEPARTMENT BUILDING. Tlie Department building Is an old structure, not tire-proof, nnd entirely Inadequate In dimen sions to our present wants. Many thonsan.ts of dollars are novr paid annually for rent of prlvato' ituit.iings to accommodate the various imreaus of the Department. I recommend on appropria tion for a new War Department building, suited to the presout and growing wants of the nation. 

ARMY AND NAVY. The report of lhe Secretary of War shown a very satisfactory reduction In the expenses of the army for tho lust fiscal year. For deiallnyoa arc referred to Ids accompanying report. The ex- 10 uses of the navy for the' whole of ttie last year, . c, from December 1. 1 sw;0. the date of the last report, are less than lli.lio.lHl, or about 1,000,000 less than they were the previous year. Tho expenses since the comiiie'ncement of this fiscal year. f. e., nlnco Julv 1, nhow for the five mnutlis a decrease of ovfr J'J. WO.OIIO from those of the corresponding months of lost year. The estimates for the ciirrvnt vear were .5".V Tim.OM. Those for the noxt year aro f'in,tls.l),.'tl7, with JlifW.KiO additional tor the necessary perma nent lmprovementn. These estimates are made closely for the maintenance of the naval establish ment as It now Is, without much In the nnture of jiermaneiit Improvement. Tlie appropriations made for the last and current yearn were evidently Intended by Coug-icss and aro sufficient only to keep the navy on its present footing, by tho re pairing and refitting of our old ships. This policy must of course gradually but surely destroy the navy; and it in lu Itself 'far from economical, as each year that It in pursued the necessity for mere repairs in ships and navy yarns necomen more im perative and more costly, and our current exficnses are annually increased for tlie mere rcpnlr of ships, many ofvhicb must soon become unsafe aud use lesn. I hone during the present session of Congress to he able to submit to it a plan by which naval ves sels can he built and repairs made with great sav ing non the present cont. It can hardly be wiso statesmanship of a Government which represents a country with over five thousand miles of coat line on both oceans, exclusive of Alaska, and con taining forty millions of progressive people, with relations of everv natnr. with almost everv foreign country, to rest with such inadequate means of cn forcbig any foreign policy either of protection or redress. Separated by the ocean from the" nations of the Eastern continent oitrnAW Is our only means of protection to our cltirenn" abroad, or for the en forcement of any foreign policy. posT-orpirrj hepabtment. ' The accompanying report of the PosAjnaster Gen eral shows a most satisfactory working of the de partment. With the adoption of the recommenda tions contained therein, particularly these relating to a reform in the franking privilege, and the adoption of correspondence cards, aself-snsttiinlug postal system may speedily be looked for, and at no distant day a further reduction of the rate of postage attained. I recommend authorization hy flnngrens to the Postmaster General and Attorney-General to lnue all commissions to officials appointed through their respective departments. At present these commis sions, where appointments are Presidential, are ta nned by the Stale Depanment. The law In all de- Fartments or Government, except mono 01 tne 'ostothYp and of Justice, authorizes each to lsnue its own commissions. 

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. Alwavs favoring practical reforms. I respectfully call your attention to ono abuse of long standing. which I would like to nee remedied hv this Con gress. It In a reform In tho civil nervtce or the country. I would have It go beyond the mere fix ing of the tenure of office of clerk" ami employees who do not require the advice and consent of the Sonnt to make their appointment, complete. I would have it govern not the tenure but the man ner of making all appointments. There Is no duty which so much embarrasses the executive and eads of departments as that of appointments, uor poseilTinSenatorn and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The nresent svdetn does not secure tho best, and often not even- fit men fop public places. The ele vation and purification of tlio civil service of the Government will lie hailed with approval by tho whole people or tne 1 ntted states. INDIAN AFFAIRS. mann received Hie niecial attention of the Adiniiii-tratlon from its Inauguration to the present day. The ex periment of making It a missionary work was tried with a rew agencies given to me nenonnuaiinn 01 Friends, and has been found to work most advan. tngeonsly. All agencies and siiTicrlntendcncien not so disposed of were given to oflieen. of the army. 1 lie act or l ongress regiiiaiing ine army renders army officers ineligible to civil positions. Indian agencies being civil offices. I determined to give all the Agencies to such religion) denominations as had heretofore established missionaries among the Indfaina. and perhaps to some other denominations who w ould undertake tho w ork on the same terms, i. c,, ns a misslonarv work. The societies selected nre allowed to name their ow n Agents, subject to the approval of tho Execu tive, and are extiected to watch over them and aid them an missionaries to Christianize and rivillzo the Indian, and to train him In the art. of peace. The Government watche. over tbe official acts of these agents, and reouin1. of them ns strict an Bo- eountubillty as if they were appointed In nny other manner. 1 emcrtain ine connficw nofie mat im policy now pursued will. In a few years, bring all the Indians upon reservations, where they will live In houses, have school -houses anil churches, will be pursuing peaceful and self-sustaining avocations, and where tbeyjnay ho visited by the law-abiding, white man with thin same impmiltv that ho now visits the civilized whito settlements. I call your special attention to the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for full Information on this sub ject. 

PUBLIC LANDS. During the 1at fiscal vear R.WS.4W acres - lie land were disposed of. Of thlsqtiantlty 8.fi!t.10 acres were taken under the homestead law.and 1.1MI, 611 acres sold for cash. Tho remainder was located w ilh military warrants, college or Indian scrip, or applied in satisfaction of grants tu railroads, or for other public uses. Tho entries tinder the home stead law during lhe last year covered U11.MS acres more than those during the preceding year. Sur veys have been vigorously prosecuted to the full extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity of land In market, will amply supply the present demand. The claim of the settlers under tne nomesteaa or ine pre-enipiion laws is tun, mm. ever, limited to lands subject to sale at prlvato entry. Any unappropriated surveyed public land mav to a limited amount he acquired under the for tnor law n, if the partv entitled to enter under them w ill comply with the reqromonin tuey presenile In regard to residence and cultivation. The actual settler's prelerouco to right of purchane Is even broader, and extends to lands which were unsnrveved at tho time of his settlement. His right was formerly eonnnod w ithin much narrower limits; and. At one period of our hlstorv, was con ferred onlv by special statutes. They were enacted from lime to time to legalize wnai was then regarded as an unauthorized Intrusion upon the national domain. The opinion that the pub lic lands shonld be regarded chiefly an a source of revenne is no longer maintained. The rapid set tlement and successful cultivstlon of them Is now justly considered of more Importance to our well-being than Is the fund which the sale of them would produce . The remarkable Prowth and prosssrlty of our new States and Territories attest tne wistiom wi 1110 lumsiuin'u w hich Invites the Idler of Ilia noli to necure A per manent home on terms within the reach of all. The pioneer who incurs the dangers aud privations of a frontier life, and thus aids hi laying the foundation of tbe new commonwealth, renders a signal serv ice lo this country, and Is entitled to lis special fa vor and protection. The laws secure that oldect and largely prnmoto the 'general welfare. They should, therefore, be cherished as a permanent fea ture of our land system. Good faith requires us to give full effect to existing grams. rue iiine-nonoreu auu iRnmins-ni puncr to wi ling apart certain sect ions of public land for edu cational purposes In the new States should be con tinued. When amnio nrovlslon shall have tieen made for these objects. I submit, as a quoslion worthy of serious consideration, whether the residue 01 our national domain should not lie wholly disposed of under tho provisions of the homestead aud pre emption laws. 

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. Tn addition to the swamp mill overflowed lands granted to the States lu w hich thoy are situated, tne lands taken tumor ine Agncuiiurui i,unego acta and for Internal Improvement purposes, under the act of September, 1MI, and tlie acts supple meulul therein, Ihure had been conveyed, up to the close of the last fiscal year, by patent or oilier i.on1vnleiit Hvlilence of title, to Stales and comora- tlons, S7.K8ll,fi7 18-100 acres, for railways, canals, and wagon-roads; and It Is estimated that an ad ditional quantity of 174. 785,51 acres la still due Bildor irrmitn fop liko uses. Tho policy of thus aiding the States In building w.jrks of Internal Improvement was lunugiiruled mora than forty years since in the errauts to Indiana and Itlliiot.to .lil those Btales Inoissnlltg ClllllllstO connect tho waters of the Wabash will) thoso of I.nke Krloaud Uie waters of Illinois with those 01 Ijike Michigan. It was follon.d, wlths.nne modifl ratloos, hi the grunt to Illinois of alternate sec tions of public land within certain limits, to aid In th. construction of the Illinois Central Railway. Fourteen State., und sundry corporations have received similar sulislilles lu connection with rall ways completed or In process of construction. As tbe reserved sections are ruled ut double the mini mum, tho snla of them ul the enhanced price has thus lu many Instances Iptlemnitled tho Treasury for lite grunted laud, 'iim comosiielluu of soniv of these thoroughfares bus iiu.ioiilikedly Khun a vig orous 1iiim'I us to lit. development ol onr rosouriicn and the settlement of the uioro distant portions of Hie country It may, however, be well luslnlud that much' of our legislation lu this legard has been characterized by Indiscriminate and pro fuse llliernllty. The United States should not loan thrlr credit in aid of any euterprttc undertaken by Ijlatea or corporations, liy graut lauds I14 any In stance, nnTcns the projected work la of acknowl edged national Importance. I am strongly In clined to tho opinion that It Is Inexpedient and nn ii.cesnapy to bestow subnldles of either descrip tion; hut should Congrens determine otherwise, I earnestly recommend that the righto of settlers ami of tlm public 1 more efl'et titally secured and protected by appropriate legislation. THE PATENT OFFICE. Itju-lng the year ending September 80, 170, then? were filed In tbe latent Office 1,4M applica tions for patents, 8.871 caveats, and I'm applica tions for tho extension of patents; patents, Including ro-lssnee and desltfiui, wore Issued, 110 ex tended; and l.twtl allowed, but not Issued, by rea son of the non-payment of tho Ileal fi-en. The re ceipts of tho otilco during the fiscal year were fi8U, 804. 1W In excess of Its expenditures. tii a cRNnpn. The work of the Census Bureau has boon encrget Ically prosecuted. The preliminary report con taining much Information of special valuo and Interest will be ready for delivery dnrlnir the present session. The remaining volumes will lie completed with all tbe dispatch consistent with perfect accuracy lu arranging and classifying tho .returns.

PENSIONS. tbe last fiscal year tho sum paid to pen sioners. Including lite cont of disbursement, wan svr.Tsn.sii.ii ; and i,7S iionnty land warrants were Issued. At Its close, l'J8,ts0 nafhes were on the pension rolls. Tho labors of tho reunion Office have been di rected to the severe scrutiny of tho evidence sub mitted lu favclr of new claims, and to the discov ery of fictitious claims which have neon heretofore allowed. The appropriation for tbe employment of special agenta for tbe Investigation of frauds tins been judiciously Used, and the result, of It havo becu of unquestionable lienctlt to the service. EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURE. The subjects of education and Agriculture Am of great Interest to 1110 success or our republican in stitutions, and our happiness and grandeur as a nation. In the Interests of ono a bureau ban been established In the Interior Department the Bureau of Education; and In the Interests of the oilier a separalo department that of Agriculture. I lie lieve great general good is to flow from the opera tions of both these bureaus, if properly fostered. I cannot commeml to your careful consideration too highly the reports of the Commissioners of r.iiiicutton sua 01 Agriculture, nor urge too strongly such lllieral legislation as to secure their efficiency. SUMMING UP. In conclusion, I would sum up the policy of the Administration to be a thorough enforcement of every law; a iiiiimui collection 01 every tax pro vided for, and economy In the disbursement of tho same ; a prompt payment of tho debt of the nation ; a reduction of taxes an rnpldly an the requirements of the country will admit, reduction of taxation and tarifT to lie so arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number; hicst and fair dealing with all other people, to the end that war with alt Its blighting cmsequencen may be avoided, but without nurrenderlng any right or obligation duo to un; a reform in tho treatment of the Indian., aud In the whole civil service of the country: and finally in securing a pcre, untrain meled ballot, where every man entitled to cast A vote may do so lust once At each election, without fear of molestation or proscription ou account of U.

For the year ending June 30, HUM, the ordinary revenues were trl884I.M0.7. and the cx- fiendltures 2;.H!H.181.fVl. The Increase of revenue or the year Into, over the year piSfl, was $1.4-27,-7i O.iis, or 7.7S per cent, and the increase of expen ditures sum. Tist. 1.1, or 1.3-i per cent, showing a net Increase In revenue of 1.1 47.008. 80. The Increase In revenne for the rear 1K70 over the year lwiti was f 3.4Ti.10.M. or 11.35 per cent., and the Increase of expenditures lor 170 over imt was i,tim,thi.'.i, or 5.57 percent.

Against I7.(!(.4 for the year IW, There were In the service of the department on the 80th of June. 1S70. 7.05 con traetors for the transportation of tbe mails. Of mull routes in operation there were 8,h11, aggre gating In length i8l.-i.Tj miles; annual transporta tion, tt7fl.-llo.tsi miles, and In annual cost, f ltl.sst, ti."i.'l Adding tho compensatlou of railway post office clerka, ronto ageuts, local Agents, mail messengers, mail route messengers and baggage masters In charge of registered package, amount ing to l.4T0,t"i. the aggregate annual cost was tl'2,.Vi.54.'i. The service was divided as follows: There was an Increase over the preceding year in length of routes of 7.501 miles; In annual trans puliation. . ini.!K miles, and the cost. $I78.1cJ. Adding the increased cost for railways, post office clerks, route, mail and other agents, fr.Cj.tM, tho total increase lu cost was li7H,M5. The foregoing statement of Increase and cost, does not Include service for special offices. There w ore, at tho close of the your, S.tiiu of these, caeh with A mall carrier, wfc ise pay from the depart ment is rot allowed to exceed the net postal yield of tuo office. Special routes and tlicircarriers are Included, however. In the number of contractors aud routes as given above. The atteutiou of Con gress is again called to the necessity of A revision snd readlnstment of tbe rates of compensation established by law for the transportation of malls on railroad routes. The managers of railroads Insist that the pay awarded them nnd.r the opera tion of the act of the 8d of March. lsr, is Inade quate to the service required, and many of them have refused, and still refuse, to enter Into con tracts with the department, alleging that they will not tiind themselves by a permanent arrangement at the present prices. The consequence Is that on many of the most important routes the mails are carried as suits the convenience of the companies, and with hut little regard to the public Internet. Many complaints of inefficient service, andin some instances ni cross nogieci on ,uo u.ri ,11 iau ...... companies, have beeu made during the past year ny souie or ttie leaning newspapers 01 uiotnuimj, but notwithstanding the most persistent etlorU to remedy the evils complalnod of, vory little If any improvement haa yet been effected, the depart ment having no control of the time or manner of running trains, except 111 cases wncro couiraci. have been regularly executed. After a careful consideration of tbe subject, I am SAtisfled that tho compensation fixed by law Is not a fair return for tho important service ren dercd hy railroad companies, nnd hence, I repeat my recommendation that A re Adjustment of tbelr pay be made hy law, and at the same time they he required to enter Into A contract with the Dopartmont as a condition pre cedent to drawing any tncrea e of compensation. The amount of fines Imposed on contractors, and deductions made from their pay on account of failures and other delinquencies during the last year, was 1100,875 34, and the amount remitted for the same period $'2n,758.0, leaving lhe net amount 71.ilW.07. This shows an Increase on the net amount of fines and deductions over the ycarlxflu, of 'J1.870.1. and a decrease in tho amount of re missions of 17,1(I7.74. The increase In the fines and deductions Is not attributable to Increased de linquencies, but to the fact that since the 1st of April, twin, the provisions of many contracts for tbe forfeiture of the pay of a trip when the trip has not been mado.bas been enforced in conformity with the act of July . W8rt. Since the adoption of this rule, contractors have evinced a much greater amount of energy In their efforts to carry tlie malls through to the points of destination. During tho past year, a,071 cases of loss by mall depredations occurred, of which 1,574 registered letters wre reported to the department, involv 1,,,. In k...ls .lr.ri. .ml monov to the amonnt of l,8!W,7i'-i.Si, a considerable portion of which has lieen recovered. The rumiier 01 ar rests for violations of the postal laws waa 148, .and the number of convictions of those who were brought to trial M, tho remainder neing reieuseu, acquitted, or held Kir trial.

The Rtfiint. of ouch rif tlieso linos having declined to transport the malls for the reduced rates of sea postage established by tho additional postal con vention with the United Kingdom, which went Into operation on the 1st of January, 1870, the service was for a short time interrupted; but new arrangements wero speedily concluded on tho basis of tho reduced rutea of compensation for a regular semi-weekly conveyance of mnlls to Europe by tho steamships of the I.lvcrpol and Urnat Western I touitiiLiiv.

The I'nltod stntes postage on the malls convey od to and from the West Indies, Mexico, Panama, Sonth Pacific, Belize, Honduras, amounted to o.tW.051 .bn, and the amonnt paid for the sea con veyance thereof was 74.45fi.81. The contractor for the mail steamship service from New York to ltlo do Janeiro, Brazil, and from San Francisco to Japan and China have performed In a satisfactory nmuner tho full service required by tholr respect ive contracts of twelve roitnd trips per annum, hnt ton round trips only havo boon made by the steam ships of the California, Oregon Mexican Steam ship Company, contractors for the monthly ser vice between San Francisco Honolulu, and Ha waiian Inlnndn. T respectfully renew tlie recom mendation made In my last report for an Increase of mail nervire from monthly to seml-nionlhly trips on the mail steamship route from San Fran cisco to Japan and China. Impressed with the great national importance of maintaining this line of American steamships, nnd tho necessity of pro viding Increased facilities of communication with thone conntrlen lu order to retain and extend the commercial advautagen already gained by Its es tablishment, I felt It my duty to address a special communication on the subject to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Post Offices and Pont Itoadn nnder date of Slnt April, 170 Senate Document No. 15, Forty-flmt Congress, third session, In which statements were presented obtained from official sources, showing the growth of onr trado with Japan and China nluce the line was established, and the amounts of correspondence transported, and the financial results of the enterprise. I beg to refer to that communication for the special considera tion, which render It expedient, in my Judgment, to sustain this Important nntlonal enterprise, a.d to express the hope that Congress will promptly pass the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Pont Offlccn nnd Pont Roads at the last session, authorizing an Increase of the ser vice to semi-monthly trips under the same terms And conditions as the present monthly service. The excess, of business of the Department, as compared with last year, is a follows: lipttor car riers, UK; mnlls delivered, 17.740.778; local letters delivered. 3.417.05?; newspapers delivered. 5,91. 185; letters collected, 70.000.370 ; amount paid carriers, 4,01lt,4H4; postage on local matter, 1, 500.728. During the past year, the salaries of ea..tn Postmaster, have been readjusted. Th. establish ment of new offices and the. increase of salaries will not. It Is thought, exceed the appropriation of r,.tVM,nn0 for the current year. Whole number of letters received at the Dead Tetter office dnring the year, 4.15?.4in, of which M0.41 5 were foreign letters; SS3.211 lerters con taining money In sums of $1 or more, amounting to H.8A0.. of thin amonnt 7.11.W wan deliver ed to the writers or persons addressed ; 2t.1M4 let ters contained money In snmn lens than $1, amounting to $5.7!tS.60. of which A'.Orin.Ti was de livered to the writers or persons addressed ; 17. 800 letters contained cheeks, drafts, deedn.

The sum of H.340,'2fi0.69 was trans ferred hy Postmasters from the postage to the money order arconnt to enable thorn to meet or ders presented for payment. I am thoroughly satisfied that If the franMne privilege were repealed tho .department In a short tluie would become self-sustaining. This aser tiou lms heretofore been warmly dc,i)lcU... Tlie do. 814.110 08. An accurate acrniTtt 01 the cost of free matter dispatched through the mails was ordered to lie kept hy all Postmasters for six months, be ginning January 1 and ending Juue'80)ast, andTe turns are now being Tecelved. Enough is known to enable an opinion to lie expressed that tbe ac tual roturnswill show tho actual cost of Iree mat ter to be fully equal to all tbe deficiency. The .term during which the account wan kept wan con fined to tho flrnt half of the year when fow elec tions were held, and when only a email portion of the public documents are transmitted. Should the amount of franked matter ho actually ascer tained during the Presidential canvass and sub jected to the name postage an like matter sent by private persons, I am sure that the average cont per year wonld he greatly enhanced. My anxiety to liiake the department self-sustaining, arises from B strong desire to reduce and make uni form rates of postage In 187t. The amount de rived from letter postage wan Hi.77l.!r38.70, and from newspapers and pamphlets only fcCM, 834.00, and yet tho weight and hulk of news paper mails aro at least tea times greater than those jot lettei niiiiln. Thisnhows that, while news. tiapers ur,o charged milch less than the cost of heir transmission, letters are charged much more, and In fairness letters should be rodnccd In post age as soon as the finances of the department will permit. If letter postage conld be reduced from 8 to ft cents I am sure that the Increased correspond ence thereby stimulated would. In a few years. compensate for any temporary loss of revenue, and that many voxntlous losses would bo avoided hy a uniform rate for all distances which would ttins be estahltshad ; hnt I despali ut securing any further reduction of letter postage so lone an the franking privilege shall ne imposed npon mis ne partment. It is not Intended to Intimate lhat there should be an increase of postage on newspapers. On the contrary. It Is tho duty of the government . to aid hi the education of the people by carrying newspatiers as cheaply as possible, and hence! am of opinion that the present ratea are not too low, nor do I ohlect to the free transportation of news papers to regular subscribers In the counties of their publlcslion. As now authorized by law, their conveyance without charge doea not Inter fere with tlie npeedv and regular trannmlssion of the maun, 't'nere is nni one cnaneu uisv 1 ueem advisable In the treatment of newspapers, and that applies only to those sent to points ontsido of the county where published. I wonld require postage on printed matter In all eases to be pre paid by stamps. The law allowing postage to be fiald iu money bv suliscrtbers at the office of de Ivery, Is a departure from the accepted th.ory of Post Office management, and only subjocts the department to heavy losses. Tbe Postmaster General earnestly recommends the adoptloB. early In the session of Congress, of the bill introduced by Mr. Karnsworth, to revise. consolidate, and amend tne s unities reiauug 10 the Post Office Department. Tho new postage regulations, and the accumu lation of copper and nickel coins in Pont OftVcn, receive some attention In the report. He respect fully recommends the establishment of the postal card svstem. of which so mnch has been said, and advocatss It hy the nsnal arguments. He advises that the rate he fixed at one cent, Inclndlngcost of card, as a first step toward A genoral reduction of letter pusi age. 

ANNUAL REPORT OF COMMISSIONER CAPRON. TnE following Is an abstract of the Agricultural report of Commissioner Capron for tho present vesr: The Commissioner begin, hy expressing his gratification at being Able lo represent the grcAt Interest of Agriculture as prosperous. Although he asserts the present season bus been ono to test severely iho capabilities of our soils. He says, however, that tho fact of Increased production, In a season remarkab e tor excessive neat, tu a coun try assumed lo bo liable to Injurious extremes of temperature and seasons of conlinnod aridity, af fords strong evidence of the available depth aud rcrtllity or our arable land.

It w ould do moro It would feud to the increase of the fertility of the soil, which, now, lu nine rurius out oi ion. is annually decreasing, and it would proportionally ailvHiice lis iiilpinsle as well as market value. it la gratifying to lielleve, from luduhltahlo evi dence, the examples of rational and reciiierutlve culture are relatively Increasing, however slowly, and gradually making Inroads upon the destructive, Irrational modes so generally prevalent, 'i uese ex ainoles are most numerous ill tlie Middle Stab's, are seen with comparative frequency iu Iho older sections of the Wesl, are found occasionally in New England, aud are Ixigiuutiig lo be noted lu liiu South ern Slates; hut there Is no State lu which exhaust ive and irrational culture is not predominant. While the cost of good land Is less than lhe interest ou its intrinsic value, and Its yearly Income may he en hanced at the exiense of the ormaiieut Investment, tiiero is little bono that the present necessity or short-sighlcd greed will fail to work Its Improve ment; but wilh high prices, both of laud and labor, it Is more timn folly to expect remunerative profits from iiiiBvsstemaiic and unscientific culture. After specifications, the Commissioner discusses the subject uf Industrial educatlou. lie refers to agricultural colleges lu existence lu many Slates, and savs that he I. citildcnt. that these Institu tions are destined to lsseoine a vhal power lu the laud, which colleges weighted with a "curriculum" of similes of clusslcal aces can. never exert; but It will lie many years netore their uest rruiis win liegiu to appear, and uiiiny miiukce will tie miula, (snii of thein. possibly, almost fiiUd tu tluir ch.uiu'teri. misconceptions "of the sphere of tluir l.lrttest Utility Will occur, unil Inetll, leney Will liu doiilileillv mar llie heauiv of their practical results but iillmalely, when the grand Idea of practical education In America shall be fully crystallzed, and Ihelr faculties shall be composed of young and vigorous men, developed wlttilu these iusutu ttons and under lhe Influence of higher tirogres. slon in iihytlcal tod practical science, then their true utility and beuellaeutluilueuve. will begin, to appear. In view of this ho respectfully suggests the Importance of an authorization, by Congress, 0,1 a comnilsnion, under tho direction of tho Agrl cultural Department, to examine minutely the plan of organization, the constrnctlon of buildings, man agement of grounds; and general workings of the Industrial college, organized under the Congres sional land grant, with instructions to report to the next. Congress for the Information of tho country ami the benefit of Institutions of similar character yet to be organized. Tho Commissioner thinks It Is to he regretted that bo many still adhere to tho tmpracllcahlo Idea of locomoltlve traction. The reports of the actual work of the flvo steam plows now In oieratlon by stationary engines. In this country, are extremely favorable to the Idea of itltlmtito saccess In tho so lution of tho problem of steam lu plowing as an Atljniic.tof onr agriculture. Silk culture In California has been attended with great success np to the present time, silk ciiltur Ists claiming tbnt the cllmnto of Hint State is pecu liarly adapted to ttie rearing of nllk-wormn on ao count of tho dryness and eqnallty of tho tempera ture, and the rare occurrorico of severe thunder storms. In Utah experiments have been made with snrcess In feeding the worms upon the leaven of the Osage orange Instead of the mulberry. The Jnpanene sllk-wnrtn, ijatwl cynAti, on the ailan thus, Is now perfectly acclimated, and breeds In the open air In Brooklyn. Philadelphia, and other places, but as yet I have heard nothing of the nso of lta cocoons In manufacture. Two other sllk- Krodnehiff worms. Allium tyffmn mrt and nrnW, ave been bred thin seanon In Brooklyn, hut aro yet too ncarce to be of any value. The Commissioner siwakn of the Cinchona or Permian bark tree as one deserving of great con sideration. Tho supply Is limited and precarious, with no means of extension bv propagation or cultivation In South American nations. Ho recom mends the establishment eof one or more national plantations at points selected on account of their favorable cllniallcf Influences. The time Is now opportune for commencing such a work, since a ntipplyof yonng trees In easily obtainable from a source wlienco no real difficulty arising from transport and transplantation woiild occur. The propagation of tbe finchona has been commenced In the experimental division of the department with highly successful results, and several hun dred specimens now on hand will be increased to thousands whenever facilities nre aflorded for testing the feasibility of snccessfnl prowth in the oien air. The Commissioner earnestly hopes that an appropriation will be granted by Congrens for tbl pnrpone. Tlie Commissioner, after referring lo the high order of talont required In the clerical force of the department, savs that for sneh labor tbe most meagre compensation only Is offered, and It Is fonnd difficult to obtain an Increase of suitable service, and Impossible to remunerate properly that already employed, which Is found to be most efficient and reliable, while that which Is practical ly useless for the purpose Is offered In nnlimlted measure, no therefore believes that a Jnnt and wi revision of clerical salaries would greatly In crease the efficiency of tbe department. The work of the "pant year Includen the collection of the facts of production and experiment through out the world, the publication of general and spe cial reports, investigations 1n natural science In its relation to rural efforts, the introduction and propa gation of many new and promising plants, and the Increase and lihnrovement of farm products by tbe dlsemlnation of seeds end plsnts. The Commissioner again calls attention fo the Important necessity of establishing a division of veterinary surgery in the department. He says the value of stock lost annually from disease In enor mous, and threatens not onlv to decimate onr ani mals, but to expose tho human famllv to disease from the consumption of unwholesome m.ats. A quarto edition of the reports arising from the cattle disease investigation, conducted nnder the auspices of the department, some of them never before published. Is In course of publica tion. The correnpondence of the entomological dlvl nlon haa largely Increnned dnring the year, inquiries In regArd to noxious insects having been received from all parts of tho country. The cotton arniT worra appears lo have been less destructive than usual and few complaints of loss from other rotton Insects have been made, while Insects lnlnrlonn to fruits and vegetables have been nnnsnallv nnmer onn end destructive. It In In contemplation to pul llnh, whenever snltable authority in given for the printing and illiintratton, a work on entomology, prepared hy the entomolngint of the department. In which known American Insects of each order will he accurately figured npori copper-plate, and which han been declared, hy those competent to judge, the most complete aiid exhaustive effort ever mado In thin direction. During tho year many vain able additions have beeu made to the mnsen'm, under the charge of the entomologist, by voluntary contributions or ex change, without the aid of any appropriation whatever for tho purchase of new or rare sped-
