The case of John Q. Meyers, admin istrator of the estate of Paul B. Swet lick. against the Home Life Insurance company, of New York, appealed to the ITnited States circuit court of appeals at St. Louis, has been remanded to the circuit court of Kansas for a new trial Swetlick was killed in 1S92. He had about $S7,000 life insurance. All the in surance except $25,(H)0 was paid. John Q. Meyers, administrator, brought suit tor the recovery of the balance. The suit in the case in question was decided In favor of the plaintiff by Judge Hook, and an appeal was taken by the insur ance company in July of last year. The question involved in the effort to jret a rehearing was the matter of the authenticity of the answers made by an applicant for insurance to the ques tions propounded in the application blank. "The validity of an insurance policy depends on the truthful answer to questions propounded by the company when application for insurance is made" is the gist of the opinion handed down by the United States circuit court of appeals. Judge Elmer H. Adams de livered the decision and remanded the case to the circuit court for a new trial. Following Swetlick's death his heirs sought to recover from the Home In surance company $25,000. At the trial of the case in the United States circuit court in Topeka, It developed in the tes timony that when Swetlick applied for the policy he answered in the negative a question put by the insurance com pany as to whether or not he had any other insurance. In reality he had. Paul B. Swetlick lived on a farm near the Pottawatomie reservation in Jack Bon county. He obtained life insurance aggregating about $S7.000, and had paid one or two premiums when he was killed.. He was a poor man. and the big insurance he had taken out caused the insurance people to suspect suicide. This suspicion was strengthened by the fact that his own revolver was found tied to his saddle. He was found dead near his horse near the bushes, with a bullet hole in the back of his head The coroner's jury decided that he came to his death by the hand of an unknown person. The attorneys for the com panies were Rossington. Smith & Hist ed. of Topeka, and for the defense John H. At wood, of Leavenworth. The decision of the court of appeals will have a widespread bearing on in surance cases in the future. Mrs. Katherine Klusmire, who was murdered by her husband near Holton last May, was a sister of Swetlick. Temperatures of Large Cities.

The pistol with which James Seymour Ayers was killed at the Hotel Kenmore last May, and for w hose murder Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine is undergoing trial, figured prominently in today's proceedings of the case. Duncan B. Hubbard, of Mount Clemens, Mich., who formerly lived at the Ken more, testified that he had seen a pistol in a bureau drawer in Ayers' room, and identified the weapon in evidence as being very similar to it. Thomas Ford, of Sanilac county, Michigan, testified that while on a visit here last January Ayers had loaned him a revolver. The witness described the weapon in detail and said that the one with which the killing was done closely resembled it, even to certain marks on the handle. He also testified that when Ayers loaned him the pistol it was loaded. J. P. Stevens also testified to having seen st ri5tol in Avers' l-rvm ami nartiallv I identified the one in evidence. A. K.

He said it was a si-nple operation to remove blood spots from garments and that he had fre quently done so in a manner to leave no trace of the spots. Witnesses also tes tified during the morning session of the court to the dances given in the hotel at which Ayers and Mrs. Bonine were present and to the bloody finger marks on the curtain in Ayers' room.

ORIENT. Frisco Koad Said to Be Negoti ating With Stilwell For the Mexican End of the Enterprise. South McAlester, I. T., Dec. 3. It is reported on reliable authority that the H. Clay Pierce syndicate which owns a controlling interest in the St. Louis & San Francisco railway, the Fort Worth & Rio Grande, the Mexican Central and the Monterey & Mexican Gulf railways, is negotiating with A. E. Stilwell and associates for the completed track and grade and concessions held in Mexico of the Kansas City, Mexico & Orient Railroad company. If the deal is con summated the Pierce syndicate will, 't is said, abandon that part of the pro posed Kansas City, Mexico & Orient which runs from Texas to Kansas City. A line will be constructed from either Junction City or Mason, Texas, to Sierra Mojada, in the state of Chihua hua, Mexico, where connection will be made with the Mexican Northern whin runs from Sierra Mojada to Escalon on the Mexican Central. The Chihuahua and Pacific which runs from the City of Chihuahua to a point about 120 miles west toward the Pacific slope, has been purchased by the Pierce syndicate and will be made a di vision of the Frisco system. LOBDELL IS READY. Says He Will Hold Court in Spite of Judge Andrews. C. E. Lobdell, of Dighton, who has been appointed judge of the' Thirty third judicial district by Governor Stan ley, to succeed Judge J. E. Andrews, is in Topeka today, and says he expects to go ahead and hold court, no matter whether Judge Andrews gives up the office or not. , Judge Andrews will probably do the same thing, and a peculiar situation is likely to result. Which ever one is rec ognized by the sheriff and clerk of the district court will probably get the pris oners to try and have the court ma chinery, and the other one will have to bring quo warranto proceedings in the supreme court. A similar state of affairs may develop in the other judicial districts in -which, contests may arise. FUNSTWS RETURN. Little General Will Not Reach Kansas Until Spring. Iola, Kas., Dec. 3.

Members Actually Listen to President's Message. House Breaks Into Cheers at One Particular Passage. COMMITTEE ON RULES. Underwood Substituted Fcr Bailey, Now a Senator. Senators Follow Clerk's Read ing From Printed Copies. Washington, Dec. 3. There was a very good attendance in the gallery of the house today to listen to the reading of the first message of President Roose velt. The members gathered early, chatting and discussing prospective leg islation. The main topic was the per sonality of the new president. Keen interest was manifested in what he would have to say in his message. As the hands of the clock pointed to 12 Speaker Henderson called the house to order. After the journal had been read and approved, Mr. Cooper (Tex.) and Mr. Wood (Cat), who were not present yesterday, appeared at the bar and were sworn in. On motion of Mr. Payne, the floor lead- er of the majority, it was agreed that I when the house adjourns today it be to ihccl on r nuay. The speaker announced the appoint ment of the committee on rules, as fol lows: Mr. Henderson of Iowa, Mr. Dalzell of Pennsylvania, Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, Mr. Richardson of Tennessee and Mr. Underwood of Alabama. The only change in the committee was substitution of Mr. Underwood for Mr. Bailey of Texas, who is now a member of the senate. Mr. Bingham of Pennsylvania, at the head of the committee appointed to wait upon the president, reported that the committee, accompanied by a like committee of the senate, had performed its duty, and that the president had re ceived their message with pleasure, and had said that he would at once com municate with the two houses in writ ing. Two minutes later Major Pruden, assistant secretary to the president, ap peared at the main entrance and an nounced a message from the president. The message was taken to the speaker's de?ik, where Speaker Henderson broke the seal.. "A message from the president of the ITnited States" he said as he handed the document to the reading clerk and directed him to read it. Ordinarily presidential messages at the opening of a congress are listened to In perfunc tory fashion, but today throughout the reading the keenest interest was mani fested. Hardly a member left his seat until the reading was concluded. There was a slight murmur of ap plause when in concluding the recom mendation for legislation to put down anarchy the clerk read: "No matter calls more urgently, for the wisest thought of congress.' The murmur when this sentence was read, was followed by a burnt of ap plause when the clerk read: "The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled, it burns like a consuming flame." Proba bly no other portion of the message at tracted so much attention as that re lating to trusts. No demonstration was evoked by the reading of this portion of the message but the recommendation for the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion law drew applause from both sides of the house. The reading of the message was con cluded in the house at .2:35 p. m. Mr. Grosvenor then offered the following resolution which was adopted without division: "Resolved, That a committee of' one member from each state represented in this house be appointed on the part of the house to join such committee as may be appointed on the part of the senate to consider and report by what token of respect and af fection it may be proper for the congress of the United States to express the deep sensibility of the na tion to the tragic death of the late president, Wm. McKinley, and that so much of the message of the president as relates to that deplorable event be referred to such committee." In pursuance of the terms of the reso lution the speaker appointed a commit tee consisting of one member from each state and territory. The house then as a further mark of respect adjourned. IN THE 

SENATE. In anticipation of the receipt of the first message of President Roosevelt, members of the senate today assembled early in the senate chamber and in the cloak rooms adjoining. Many of the senators, particularly the close personal and political friends of the president already were familiar with the principal features of the message but the read ing of the first important state paper of the president was marked by unus ual interest. Despite the cold and penetrating rain which fell throughout the morning, the galleries of the senate were well filled with interested spectators, many of them having a special interest in the message. When the journal of yesterday's pro ceedings had been read a communication was received from the house informing the senate that body had been organ ized and was ready to proceed with public business. Senators Hale and Morgan reported that they had waited upon the presi dent in conjunction with a like com mittee of the house to inform him that congress was prepared to receive any communication he might have to make. The president had said he would com municate with congress at once in writing. Major O. L. Pruden, assistant secre tary to the president, then was recog nized and presented the message of the president, the reading of which was begun at once by Henry M. Rose, chief clerk. Close attention was given to the read ing of the message by all senators. Printed copies of the document were distributed among them, - the majority of whom followed the reading from their copies. After adopting resolutions of respect for the late President McKinley, the senate at 2:28 p. m. adjourned. Frank Gould Weds. New'Jork, Dec. 3. Frank Jay Gould, the youngest son of the late Jay Gould, and Miss Helen Kelly, daughter of the late Edward Kelly, were married last evening at the Kelly residence, this city. Owing to the death recently of Commo dore Kelly, the wedding was without display. Only members of the two fam ilies were present. 

MIXED HUSBANDRY. Secretary Wilson Addresses National Live Stock Association. Chicago, Dec. 3. The fifth annual convention of the National Livestock association began here at the Stude baker theater today with nearly 1,000 delegates present. The convention was called to order by President Springer. Rev. C. M. Co burn of Chicago, offered a prayer, and Governor Yates and Dr. Howard Tay lor, representing Mayor Harrison, wel comed the delegates on behalf of the state and of the city. H. S. Cowan, of Texas, responded in behalf of the cat tlemen. The feature of the afternoon session was the address of Secretary of Agri culture Wilson. He spoke, of "Mixed Livestock Hus bandry," saying in part: "A well arranged system of rotation contributes greatly to maintaining the uniform fertility of the soil, and is also one of the readiest means by which to get rid of insect pests. "The department of agriculture is searching the world over for plants that may be useful in the several states and territories of the union to be used as features in systems " of rotation. Where a locality becomes addicted to the habit of growing one crop year af ter year, the average soil deteriorates unless fertilizers are applied, whether the crop be cotton, or wheat, or what ever is sold from the soil. "It is found profitable in some parts of the United States to grow rutabaga turnips and feed them to domestic ani mals. In other localities the mangel wurzel is most in favor. The cabbage, potato and other vegetables are useful along this line when their price is low. The sugar beet has been tried and gives a very satisfactory tonnage. I do not think it needs demonstration to show the wisdom of growing something of this kind to feed to domestic animals in winter. On the rich soils of the northwest, in both humid and irrigated localities rotation can be conveniently practiced. "A crop of sugar beets can be grown, then a crop of corn or oats, or alfalfa, to be fed on the farm; then the land can be seeded down for two or three years with grasses and legumes for pas ture, in order to restore to the soil the humos that was taken away by the growth of the previous crops, and also in, order to give nature time to pre pare the plant food that was taken away by the beet crop, which is a gross feeder of potash and other neces sary elements of plant growth. "The department of agriculture is trying to find markets for the products of the dairy and for many other things in foreign countries. Wheverever we go, whether east, west, or south, we meet representatives of European countries as competitors who buy the grains of the northwest and turn them into dairy products upon which they make a fine profit in addition to main taining the fertility of their soils. It is a transfer of plant food from our coun try to theirs; it is an acknowledgment that we lack either the skill or the en terprise to use our raw material to the best advantage. The hastening poverty of many soils where grains are grown for sale admonishes us that we must stop selling plant food in the shape of grain thats that are raw material for other nations." 

WORK OF KANSANS. Curtis Gets In His Bill Against Anarchists Early. Washington, Dec. 3. In the flood of bills which poured into the house on the first day of the session was one by Mr. Curtis of Kansas for the punish ment of persons assaulting or killing the president of the United States. Representative Long introduced a bill for a public building at Hutchinson, to cost $100,000, and a number of pension bills. Representative Reeder introduced a bill appropriating J50.000 to be expended in drilling wells and $200,000 for the construction of reservoirs for irrigation purposes in western Kansas, western Nebraska and eastern Colorado. In the lottery for the selection of seats in the house of representatives the Kansas delegation fared all the way from the best to the worst. Rep resentatives Long and Calderhead were among the first whose numbers were drawn, and they selected two of the best seats in the chamber. Mr. Long has the seat next to the one selected by Thomas B. Reed, while he was an ex speaker in the Fifty-second congress. Representative Reeder drew a fairly good seat half way back, Bowersock one not quite as desirable; Scott one well to the rear, while Mr. Curtis was the fourth from the last drawn, and Mr. Miller drew the last one left in the cor ner. Representative Reeder was made chairman of the committee on mileage, the only assignment made. BIGSfOBM

PRESIDENT'S Roosevelt Submits His Initial Communication to the Congress. First Part is Devoted to of President HANDLES ANARCHISTS Trusts Should Be Supervised, Not Prohibited. Favors Chinese Law Urges Aid to American Shipping and Wants Tariff Undisturbed. Washington, Dec. 3. The first mes sage of President Roosevelt to congress was submitted today. It is as follows: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: The congress assembles this year un der the shadow of a great calamity. On 

THEODORE, ROOSEVELT. I the 6th of September, President Mc Kinley was shot by an anarchist while attending the Pan-American exposition at Buffalo, and died in that city on the 14th of that month. Of the last seven elected presidents, he is the third who has been murdered, and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third as sassination of an American president, have a peculiarly sinister significance. Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in history; President Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war, and President Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed officeseeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly de praved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all govern ments, good and bad alike, who are against any form, of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws, and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free peo ple's sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot. 

MOST WIDELY LOVED MAN. It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's death he was the most widely loved man in all the United States; while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter animosities incident to public life. His political opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close associates. To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he - united . the tender affections and home virtues which are all-important in the make-up of national character. A gallant .soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him. for he never acted with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those murderous crim inals who seek to excuse their criminal ity by asserting that it is exercised for political ends, inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology can not be urged. OF 

MODERATE MEANS. President McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the wage-workers, who had en tered the army as a private soldier. Wealth was not struck at when the president - was assassinated, but the honest toil which is content with mod erate gains after a lifetime of unremit ting labor, largely in the service of the public. Still less was power struck at in the sense that power is irresponsible or centered in the hands of any one in dividual. The blow was not aimed at tyranny or wealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the wage worker has ever had: at one of the most faithful representatives of the system cf public rights and represen tative government who has ever risen to public office. President McKinley filled that political office for which the entire people vote, and no president not even Lincoln himself was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well thought-out wishes of the people; his one anxiety in every crisis was to keep in closest touch with the people to find out what they thought and to endeavor to give expression to their t t f T N 

MESSAGE. an Extensive Eulogy McKinley. WITHOUT GLOVES. thought, after having endeavored to guide that thought aright. He had just been re-elected to the presidency be cause the majority of our citizens, the majority of our farmers and Wage workers, believed' that he had faithfully upheld their interests for four years. They felt themselves in close and inti mate touch with him. They felt that he represented so well and so honorably all their ideals and aspirations that they wished him to continue foranother four years to represent them. And this was the man at whom the assassin struck! That there might be nothing lacking to complete the Judas like infamy of his act, he took advan tage of an occasion when the president was meeting the people generally; and advancing as if to take the hand out stretched to him in kindly and brother ly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow. There is no baser deed in all the annals of crime. i 

SHOCK TO THE COUNTRY. The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days, while the president yet hovered between life and death. At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and the breath went from the Hps that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his mur derer, of love for his friends, and of unfaltering trust in the will of the Most High. Such a death, crowning the glory of such a life, leaves us with in finite sorrow, but with such pride in what he had accomplished and in his own personal character, -'that we feel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck at the nation. We mourn a good and great president who is dead; but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand heroism with which he met his death. When we turn from the man to the nation, the harm done is so great as to excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most resolute action. This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed by the teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they cannot escape their share of responsi bility for the whirlwind that is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate dem agogue, to the exploiter of sensational ism, and to the crude and foolish vision ary who, for whatever reason, apolo gizes for crime or excites aimless dis content. AT ALL 

PRESIDENTS. ' The blow was aimed not at this pres ident, but at all presidents; at every symbol of government. President Mci Kinley was as emphatically the embodi ment of the popular will of the nation expressed through the forms of law as a New England town meeting is in similar fashion the embodiment of the law-abiding purpose and practice of the people of the town. On no conceiv able theory could the murder of the president be accepted as due to protest against "inequalities in the social or der," save as the murder of all the free men engaged in a town meeting could be accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts a malefac tor in jail. Anarchy is no more an ex pression of "social discontent" than picking pockets or wife-beating. The anarchist, and v especially the anarchist in the United States, is mere ly one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he represents the same depravity in a greater degree. The man who advocates an archy directly or indirectly.in any shape or fashion, or the man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds, makes him self morally accessory to murder before the fact. The anarchist is a criminal whose perverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion and chaos to the most beneficent form of social order. His protest of concern for workingmen is outrageous in its impudent falsity; for if the political institutions of this coun try do not afford opportunity to every honest and intelligent son of, toil, then the door of hope is forever closed against him. The anarchist is every where not merely the enemy of system and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty. If ever anarchy is triumphant, its triumph will last for but one red moment, to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism. NO 

WRONGS TO REMEDY. For the anarchist, whether he preach es or practices his doctrines, we, need not have one particle more concern than for any ordinary murderer. He is not the victim of social or political in justice. There are no wrongs to reme dy in his case. The cause of his crimi nality is to be found in his own evil pas sions and in the evil conduct of those who urge him on. not in any failure by others or by the state to do Justice to him or his. He is a malefactor and nothing else. He is in no sense, in no shape or way, a" "product of social con ditions," save as a highwayman is "produced" by the fact that an unarm ed man happens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the great and holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked in such a cause. No man or body of men preaching anarch istic doctrines should be allowed at large any more than if preaching tha murder of some specified private indi vidual. Anarchistic speeches, writings and meetings are essentially seditious and treasonable. I earnestly recommend to the con gress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take Into considera tion the coming to this country of an archists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and Justify ing the murder of those placed in auth ority. Such Individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting; to glorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should ensure their rigorous punish ment. They and those like them should be kept out of this country; and t found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came; and far-reaching provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more ur gently for the wisest thought of the congress. FEDERAL COURTS SHOULD HAVE! JURISDICTION. The federal courts should beriven jur isdiction over any man who kills or at tempts to kill the president or any man who by the Constitution or by law H in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccess ful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our institutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against tht law of nations, like piracy and that form of manstealing known as the slave trade; for it is of far blacker lnfamv than either. It should be so declared by treaties among all civilzed powers. Such treaties would give to the federal government the power of dealing with, the crime. A grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded by the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had Just taken the life of the president. The people would have torn him limb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked in tiis behalf. So far from his deed being committed on behalf of th? people against the government, the gov ernment was obliged at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at the hands of the peo ple. Moreover, his deed worked not the (-lightest dislocation in our governmen tal system, and the danger of a recur rence of such deeds, no matter how great it might grow, would work only in the direction of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order. No man will ever be restrained front becoming president by any fear as to his personal safety. If the risk to the president's life became great, it would mean that the office would more and more come to be rilled by men of a spir it which would make them resolute and merciless In dealing with every friend of disorder. This great country will not fall into anarchy, and if anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its institutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines. The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath Is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame. 

COUNTRY CONGRATULATED On Account of Restored Confidence and Abounding Prosperity. During the last five years business confidence has been restored, and the nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding prosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone, although it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any country, if flood or drought comes, hu man wisdom is powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us against the consequences of our own folly. The men who are Idle or credu lous, the men who seek gains not by genuine work with head or hand but by gambling in any form, are always a source of menace not only to themselves but to others. If the business world loses its head. It loses what legislation cannot supply. Fundamentally the wel fare of each citizen, and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens which makes the nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of this individual capacity; but wise legislation and honest and Intel ligent administration can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunity to work to good effect. 

SERIOUS SOCIAL PROBLEMS. The tremendous and highly complex Industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth cen tury brings us face to face, at the be ginning of the twentieth, with very ser ious social problems. The old laws, and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law. were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enor mously increased the productive power of mankind, they are no longer suffi cient. The- growth of cities has gone on be yond comparison faster than the growth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of wealth, but in the number of very large individual, and especially of very large corporate, fortunes. The creation of these great corporate for tunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in other countries as they operate in our own. MUCH ANTAGONISM. The process has aroused much antag onism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has the average man, the wage-worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as in this coun try and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accum ulation of wealth; yet it remains true that a fortune accumulated fn legiti mate business can be accumulated by the person specially benefited only on condition of conferring Immense Inci dental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, of the type which benefits all mankind, can only exist if the condi tions are such as to offer great priz":-. as the rewards of Buccess.
