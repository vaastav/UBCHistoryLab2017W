Tub Alabama Legislature has elected Mr. GoMthwaite United States Senator to succeed Warner. Goldthwaite is a democrat. Robertson, of South Carolina, has been re elected. Tzte Placing of the Prussian Loan on the English market has been deferred. The bankers of Berlin have paid in'o fh^ Prussian Treasury thirty-four millions of thalers of the new national loan and announce that, they are ready to take up seventeen millions more.

The Hlasoo ItEVOLimoNisTs in Venezuela and the Cubans, through General Quesada, are said to have formed on alliance. The Cuban vessels in Venezuelan waters are to operate with the Blanco party in the reduction of Maracaibo. s As a return for this the Blanco administration is to recogn'^e the bolll gerent rights of Cuba. General Logan object-) to General Pleasor. ton as Commissioner of Internal Bevenue. Logan has becomc lately a perfect Congres sional spitfire. He seems to be in a chronic bad humor and is continually making faces at all bis old army and navy comrades. Ovn Advices direct from Paris represent the morale of the soldiers as excellent. Trochu's war bulletins claim successes in the recent sorties, but the statement that oa the night of the 3d Ducrot's forces bivouacked at Vincennes is sufficient evidence that tbe French were unable to maintain their positions on the iefl bank of the Loire. In addition we have a rpport from the secretary of Minister Wash burnc predicting the surrender of tbe city in throe weeks. Prince George of Saxony also telegraphs to the King, at Dresden, that further ofl naive niovemen's on the part of the French are impossible. lie is, however, too confident. It is hardly probable that Trochn will capitu late without making another desperate effort to cut through the German investing line. That 'no will fail we have no doubt; but that he will order four hundred thousand men to lay down their arms without one last struggle for victory is scarcely to be believed Th* R*twm Rttfora Iiirlo* ?> Wa?h laitoi? The First Du Wfm the Sotth? TiMiny Olorlni tJrunl'n Worlu. We have reports from Washington that the democrats and revenue reform republicans are dallying and consulting, with the view of taking possession of the next House of Repre sentatives. There is a small knot of North western republicans, conspicuous among them Mr. Allison, of Itwa ; Senators Carpenter and Trumbull, and a scattering company from the upper wheat growing countries, who claim that the agricultural interests of the West dim and greater consideration than "the small minority of manufacturers in Pennsylvania and New England who have heretofore controlled the tariff." These gentlemen, it is said, now propose to unite with the de mocrats, elect a revenue reform Speaker and maka "revenue reform" committees. The immediate objection to this is, that it is not a political measure, but an lotrlgud. The democrats may contract, but can they deliver? Thero are many democrats who believe in protection as thoroughly as Mr. Greeley. Mr. James Brooks, for instance, can Bcarcely be trusted on this tasue, for the old leaven of whigisra may begin to work at any time. Pennsylvania democrats will have a frail sympathy with any cause that will lose them votes in the iron and coal districts ; for your democratic politicians will as soon maka pig iron a hobby if he can ride it into power as a republican. " We do not sea how it is pos sible to divide at present on this issue without both parties resolving into cbaoj. Tiie sug gestion is not based upon a principle, but an expedient. Mr. Schurz and Gratz Browu may have abundint and eloquent reasons for such an alliance. But their eloquence is that of the foj who having lost his own tail proposed a general sheafing of tails among the community of foxes. However dear revenue reform may bo to Allison and Garfield and Trumbull, dear also is Presidential patronage ? the widely open door of the mansion, the bright, welcoming fire, and a gracious President willing to give and reward. All of these comforts Carl Schurz has lost, and he moans over it. Ulysses, ho cries aloud, will see the Quakers, but not the Senator ; although, "according to usage," whatever that may be, a Senator has the precedence of all the Quakers iu the land. Mr. Schurz will find it an uneasy task to coax the revenue reformers Into his cold seclusion, the inner chambers barred and no f.ice visible in the White House but the implacable face of G3neral Dont. These republican revenue re formers like office, if they do hate protected pig iron, and doat on patronage as violently as they cherish free wool and uutaxed copper. So we may dismiss this revenue reform in trigue so far as it affects the organization of the next House. The advice we give to its leaders is to tarry in Jericho until their beards are grown. A cause like what they champion ] cannot be won in a day, nor should it be perilled by being dragged into the lobbies of a , political caucus. For, as we have said, there ( is much in revenue reform ? much that is wise and timely. But it requires drilling, discip line, education of the people and more extended system of pioselytiam. The Southern States are ripe for such an is3U?. Teach Cuffue and Sambo that be is taxed on his sugar and coffee and tobacco; that he pays the government, as well as his baker and grocer, for every break fast he eats, while iron masters and growers of wool are protected into the realization of immense fortunes, and there will be a revolu tion in the untutored mind which no republi cans can chjck. The negro owes the repub licans gratitude ? a slender and shortlived virtue. Let the democrats offer him a cheaper breakfast and the work will be done. It ia with President Grant to cheek this uneasiness in his party ? for uneasiness it is, and bodes him no good. As the IIeraxd showed the other day, the power of the democracy was with Tammany ; that New York was now the real Kaystone State ; that when defeat came upon the raw and wild democratic battalions of the "red hot" copper head States the democracy of New York, under its superb leadership, stood like ths Imperial Guard of the great Napoleon aud disdained the very idea of defeat or retreat. And around the Imperial Guard a new army Is forming, with younger and better offioors and with the iaspiration of new tactics in political war. We pointed to the South for the open ing of the campaign, and behold, from the South we hear the first gun. An Atlanta paper has taken d own the name of Grant and run up that of II?ffman for President in 1872. The Tribune informs us that the editor lias just left New York, where he was diligently seen by the Tammany leaders, and intimates that ho took with him the most substantial and unanswerable rea sons for his conversion. Whether true or not, it shows that Tammany means to hold the South, to possess its avenues of opinion and influence, to make votes iu every direction in Status which arc republican from exceptional influences and by the frailest tenure. Wo have seen Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina drift back to the democracy, mainly, we must admit, under the propulsion and influence of Mr, Greeley, and General Grant is sure of none of them except South Carolina, and even South Carolina by a military occupation. Tammany rne tns to take and hold them all ? to take them with money. She has beaten the administra tion in New York, the State where the admin istration necessarily has its greatest streagtb, after a ficrce, open fijht ? beaten it, with its army and navy combined. Now she goes into other regions, and already there are signs of conquest. With the Northwest uneasy and mutinous, the South slipping from republican control, New York anchored to democracy, Indiana democratic, Pennsylvania just held by tho riegrovote; in the North all sorts of mutter ings from good people, who fear that we have not had enough of civil service and political reforms and the promised works of righteous ness ; with an uncertain and feeble Treasury policy; with Cuba grievance" and Irish long ings for an English war ; with a Cabinet, whose members, excepting Mr. Fish, are only so many decimal ciphers on the diminishing side of the Presidential unit, what must the President do to bold his power? He cannot drift into r^-clection, for he is confronted by too many elements of antagonism and danger. We all fe?l that the re-election of Grant would bs a wise thing, and oar word, if word* of oritlolsm, muit be taken as tha conns >ls of a friend and well-wisher, the republicans most take Grant or nobody. If the/ cannot elect him they can elect no oae else. It is not the nomination that is in danger, bnt the re-elec tion. To be nominated and defeated would throw a cloud orer Grant's illustrious fame that would rest upon it for all time. He is the third great general elected to the Presi dency. Washington and Jackson were re elected, and to justify his claim to the honors of their Pantheon he must have the approval of the peojile upon his adninlstration. But, as we have said, he oannot drift into 1872 and have any hope of triumph. He must command and electrify and fuse the country, as Jackson did when he made his war upon the Bank. What are Sohurs and Brown and Trumbull and Sumner and Greeley to the combination which assailed Jackson ? There were Webster, Clay, Calhoun ? the giants of a gigantic time ? backed by enormous financial strength and a great political party. Jackson defeated them all, because he made his cause the cause of the people and they sustained him. He attracted to him strong men, founded a policy, and made war. We feel confident that the conqueror of Rich mond has in his nature the dormant qualities of Jackson. Let him show Congress and the country that these qualities have come to life, let him give the country a policy which it can tako and cherish, and with his just and pure fame, his high chara3ter, and his groat popu larity, he may enter the canvass without fear, and win without trouble. But the si^ns to-day are not the signs of victory. Iler angel wings ara wingisg in other directions. She should be summoned before it is too late to li?ed tho summons. ?.??* """TrZ.-.- s* ? A Carious Pol I Heal Earthquake?Transfer of Our Local (.ovcrnmrnt to Albany. For a long time the people of the city of New York fought for release from the tyranny of rural rule ? that is to say, against the usurpa tion of their municipal prerogatives by an irresponsible and anti-sympathizing radical majority in tho Legislature. The long flght finally culminated in the adoption last year of a new City Charier, and the municipal machinery has been working tolerably smooth under it for some months. The Common Council has been recognized under this new Charter as a body with a soul and somo brains, and its wishes have baen conformed with by co-ordinate branches of the civic gov ernment. Some of tho small ward politicians have been gratified with elections as aldermen or assistant aldermen, and, while being satis fied with the position and the prospects of public plunder, have been quietly relieved from the necessity of begging for higher and more responsible and more lucrative employ ments. This state of things, wo repeat, has been in existence for several months, and every thing was supposed to bo working smoothly ind harmoniously, when, lo! like a thunder clap from a cloudless sky, comes a recom mendation from theM iyor that certain jobs, in which there ia money ? Which tne ?ame 'Ua unnecessary to explain ? shall ba taken from the bands of tho Common Council and transferred, as formerly, to the tender mercies of our rural cousins at Albany. Here is a political earthquuke passing all com prehension, and now comes in the lament of the true Common Councilman. "What have I done," he asks, "that I should be so basely treated? Why did I give my time and my money and tho money of my friends to Tam many when I was assured that I would have it back tenfold by some nice little paving csu tract or putty pavement job? Have our leaders no mercy upon us who have been stig matiz3d as poor miserable common scoundrels? Have they no bowels of compassion for us ? Do they suppose a paliry four thousand a year will Bupply us with hot suppers at Delmo nico's or cold crunches of wild duck and Piper lleidsieck anywhere else? L^t them pause and aBk 'how it would bo with themselves' under similar circumstances." Seriously, Tammany may expect to hear some growling at this restoratioa of the old and objectionable radical policy, and that, too, under democratic rule. The Legislature is beset by greed-mongers enough already, with out having this temptation of municipal job bery disturbing its sensibilities and tampering with its honesty. Besides, these jobs when they come before the Legislature will bo mag nified immensely a3 compared with the little pickings and stealings of our Common Couucilmen. A small ten thousand dol lar affair will, by tho transfer, grow into a hundred thousand dollar job, a hundred thousand into a round million, and so on to tho end of the plucking of the poor public goose. Our legislative halls will bc-come more than ever the hotbeds of startling schemes in the way of railroad grants and canal subsi dies, arcade abominations, high taxation and extravagant expenditures everywhere. No small-potato politician can make a stand there ; but such opulent personages os Alexander T. Stewart, John Jacob Astor, Marshall O. Roberts and others can have thoir full swing, ring or no rin,f. The valiant Senator Mike Norton will become a hero if he keeps his eyes wide open, and, when the session of the Legislature commences, lay a heavy hand upon the stupendous jobs already in process of incubation, and which will c?me before the body sooner or later. With barely a majority in the Senate the democrats cannot atford to dally with any measure of doubtful public policy, or encourage the rapacity of the hordes of hungry seekers after legislative favors. John H. Scrratt comes forward among the list of prominent lecturers. He delivered a lecture at Rockville, Md., last night, in which he told his own story of the conspiracy against the life of Lincoln, the assassination, his own escape, wanderings, capture, trial and ac quittal. It certainly makes an exceedingly interesting story, but as to the good tasto that turns such experience as his into a money making exhibition there may be some division of opinion. A full report of tho speech is published elsewhere in our columns this morning. President Cespbdes, of Cuba, denies in a letter which wo publish in another part of tho Herald this morning, tho allegations that tho Cubans were guilty of unnecessary cruelty to tbeir prisoners* T*ara PjMTcrei-UriTlijr ?( tb* Preach glfaii? . Our despatches this morning indicate that General De Palatines has succeeded In avoid ing the danger which Anally overcame Mar shals MacMtthon and Bazaine. Whether or not the battles near Orleans resulted in the complete turning of his left wing, it was clearly the object of the Germans to force his army back upon Tours, and either shut it up I in that city or drive it westward to Angers or Nantes. It seems, however, that De Pala dines, instead of retreating in the direction of Blois, threw back bis left wing and centre, leaving Tours on his left flank and virtually making Lyons his base of future operations. We are impressed with this belief because our latest despatches from Tours report fighting on Monday on the right wing of the French army near Montargis. It is made clear by this statement that De Paladines did not retreat in a westerly direction upon Blois, but Ihut his defeated left wing fell back, cov ering the railroad to Bourges and Lyons. Taking this view of the situation as the correct one, it becomes almost certain that Tours has been uncovered by the French. This would fiive us an explanation of the panic in the city. It is true that the place is strongly forti fied and can be defended by the corps organ ized by Count K<fralry, which was recently intrenched at Lo Mans, some miles distant to the northwest. But we doubt if there is at this moment any French force between Orleans and Tours capuble of successfully resisting the Prussian army if it advances upon the temporary capital of the French republic. All persons familiar with the geography of Franco will be struck by the fact that if the right wing of Da Paladines' army is near Mon ths Its line of battle must stretch across the Loire ; in other words, the army must be astride tfce jiver, Ordinarily this position is a most dangerous one, but it need not be ne cessarily so in this instance. Even if the Ger mans succeed in breaking the line that part on the right bank of the river has a safe line of retreat as long as Glen is hold by the French. At the samo time much depends upon the ability of the Army of the East and the Garibaldiuns to keep General Von Werder, who has for some time past been moving towards the Loire, from advancing beyond Autun. Considerable as the distance may appear between this place and Montargis it is not so great as to prevent its being tra versed by forced marches in four or five days. But there would bo no necessity whatever for Von Werder to go to Montargis. IIo need only, by a rapid march of two days, strike the Loire between Cosne and Nevers to cut off De Paladines entirely from Lyens. Aud if he succeeded in this the capi tulation which the French Army of the Loire has escaped by uncovering Tours would be come a necessity in the vicinity of Bourges. We are consequently of the opinion that unless De Paladines can at an early day beat the Prussians in his present position he will be compelled to withdraw his right wing to the left bank of the Loire, and to take up a now position fronting in a northeast direction, which will insure him a safe line of retreat in the event of the armies of Prince Frederick Charles and General Yon Werder forming a junction. It is worthy of notice that by the result of the recent battle near Orleans the relative positions of tho contending armies have been so changed that while De Paladines' forces are no further from Paris than before their de feat, the Germans are a greater distance off, and now virtually have their left flank, in stead of their rear, to their investing line before the capital. Hence if, by any stroke of fortune, the French Bhould gain a victory, the Germans would be in imminent danger of being cut off from Paris. The chance of? their being beaten, however, is so remote that it is scarcely worth considering. TIip Opportunity nnd Danger* of Our City Magnate!*. That potent body of woa which controls the affairs anil spoils of this city, sometimes called "the ring," has a splendid opportunity for accomplishing great objects. But it is a position of temptation and danger, which may lead to the worst consequences to both the city and the parly. It is a curious feature of our political life or system that a few men, not more than three or four, can rot only control, through a powerful but irresponsible political organization, the destiny, prop?rty, inte rests and finances of this metropolis, but the politics of the State, and, to a great extent, of the country also. Wa do not propose to go into the philo sophy of tbis state of things new. We are simply stating a fact. Nor ia it necessary to measure the relative amount of power each individual of "the ring" possesses. Some will have it that Mr. Tweed is tho great magnate that controls tlia rest; others that Mr. Peter B. Sweeny i3 tho leading spirit ; many say that these two together are the all-powerful masters of the ring and organization. Then it is said that there is a triumvirate, and that Mayor Hall is the other member of it. A^ain, some assign Mr. Richard B. Connolly a lead ing position. But, whatever may bo the rela tive position or irfluence of any of these leaders, it is certain the whole power of Tam many, and, consequently, over the city and politics of the State is in the hands of three or four men at most. Seeing there was need of a change in tho government of the city, and favoring munici pal self-government, which the radicals had taken away, we favored the ascendancy of the party now in power here. We have given the leaders good advice and our support because they promised well. Tiiey began well, too, as far as improving tho city goes ; but there is some reason to fear they r.re falling into bad habits. Instead of using the money of the city treasury for legitimate and useful purposes only, they are, it is to bo feared, creating jobs to buy up those who havo been or might be op posed to them. That they will enrich them selves is to be expected, and if they will do this only from the advantage their situation gives them, without putting their hands di rectly into the treasury, and will give us some thing like an equivalent in the way of improve ments for the money they expend, tho people will not bo disposed to complain. But why buy up by jobs or commissions the rag-tag and bob tail opposition ? The triumph was complete over i that little faction calling itself the Young De? mocracy. Why, then, after their victory do they bring the leaders of this faction into ?ituationa of Importance and preflt? Harry Genet is rich enough, probably, not to care about the spoilt) or to aooept any offloe ether than he has as Senator ; but Norton, Creamer and others are, it seems, quite willing. The new City Hall has been an enormous plum for the leading politicians and their friends, and while we do not say Mr. Norton will find another one he is placed in a situation to search for It. It is curious to see, toe, the overwhelming Christian charity of the ring magnates to the so-called democratic organ of this city which recently* assailed them with the vilest epithets. This is giving one's cloak to the man who steals the coat with a vengeance. This may be very well according to Christian ethics, but is doubtful policy in such a case. The Tammany leaders were in a position to ignore the slippery fel lows who only opposed them for the sake of making a bargain, and who would oppose them again to-morrow if they could make more by it. Theso leadors should have given the bolters the go-by and appointed the most respectable men in the community to offices of trust. In the end, yes, in a short time, they would have made themselves stronger with the best citizens of all classes and parties. If the stupendous jobs that were projected in the way of improvements bo carried out in the old style, as, for example, that job of the new Court House, New York will be Hauss mannlzed, our cltizans will find themselves overwhelmed with taxes and debt, and the democratic party in this city and State will find their Gravelotte and Sedan, as Napoleon found his. Improve the city by all means, for there is much need of it, but let that bo done in all cases by the consent of the citi zens and under the control of the best men in the community. Bringing back the old cor rupt influences to power does not look well, and we warn the Tammany magnates of the danger. , - | Canada and the President'* Message. The Canadian papers discuss with some warmth that portion of the President's Mes sage relativo to the Canadian fisheries, and it would seem that the people themselves are somewhat excited over the unusually belli gerent tone with which our Pre3ident says that it will become his duty to protect the rights ot the citizens of the United States if the New Dominion undertakes to enforce her odious and unjust provisions again, t our fishermen. Theso words from a quiet man who acts rather than talk?, frighten the Canada that was so belligerent some time ago. They smell more strongly of gunpowder than Fuits the fastidious nostrils of - Canadians, who have been used to nothing of lute more overpower ing than Fenian blasts and who distinctly remember Vicksburg and Richmond, and probably have not yet succeeded in forgetting the St. Albans raid. The President states that no vessel has yet been condemned under the provisions of the measure ; but even while the Canadian people were reading and digesting the word3 for the first time, and beginning to regret inwardly that they had ever been bo foolishly malicious, a judge in Halifax was declaring forfeit to the government the American fishing schooner Wampthuck and her entire stores, cargo and rigging. This is essentially enforc ing the fishing laws, and the contingency under which the President has stated that ho would protect the rights of the citizans of the United States has burst full upon him before the purport of the words has become fully defined to the people most interested. Con gress has already called for information r2 Rfirding certain seizures. The question comes now, shall we have war on the fishery qusstion or will Canada recede ? The Canadian papei-3 evidently dread war. The peopls don't want it, and it is, therefore, most likely that some modification of the mat ter will be made. A bold, independent stand for the right, backed by the urmy and navy and tbe still blooming military prestige of the United State3, is not likely to fail of its purpoae, especially when made in person, as it were, by the conqueror of Lee. Little Canada already talks of tilling ber mamma, and refers timidly to the great power of Great Britain, and intimates that she is yet a minor, and is not responsible for her acts, and that we shall havo to whip England first ; but that view of the case makes no difference with us. We don't care who takes up tie quarrel. Our fishermen rau3t have their rights. From Lii.le comes a despatch stating that a great movement of troops is in progress there. We suppose these forces belong to the Army of the North recently beaten near Amiens. If they are still a compact, organized body of men they may effect some wonderful j changes in the military situation. An army fifty thousand strong leaving Lille with ten days' provisions could, by forced marches, enter the Argonno Mountains, and, making Mezi&res a base of opera ions, deatroy the German liae of communication with Metz. Of course the movement would be fraught with danger; but it is just such a one as a Napoleon would have successfully made. The French generals of the present day, however, seem incapable of bold, hazardous action. The Hebrew Fair. ? This splendid and suc cessful fair at the Twenty-second ltegiment Armory, in Fourteenth street, is daily open from two o'clock until eleven o'clock P. M., except on Fridays, when it closes at five P. M.t and on Saturdays, wheu it reopens at six P. M. The object of the executive committee has manifestly been to eclipse every other hundred thousand dollar fair of the season. The affluence of visitors has already been so groat and constant that tho most sanguine expecta tions of the charitable promoters of this fair in aid of the Mount Sinai Hospital and the Hebrew Orphan Asylum will probably bo sur passed. The Steamship Collision Off Long Bran on. ? The collision between tho Isaac B^'l and tho Champion on Monday night in a fog off Long Branch seems to have been one of those inevitable casualties for which there is "nobody to blamu."

" ad ere th* In the Senate Mr. Conkling introduced a bill to promote telegraphic communication between our Pacific States and the far East, and, oon, eequently, to complete the grand lines of' elec^ trio Intelligence that are girdling the world and inevitably making America its midway depository. The defect in the bill Is that Ift guarantees the sole and absolute right to con struct the transpacific line to one com pany, therein specified, for the term of twenty-one years? a lifetime In these days of rapid movement and invention ? and the honorable Senator took especial care to remark that he performed hiq duty in this case without thereby intending to commit himself. He is wise in this, because' the need of an Oriental line from S in Fran cisco is self-evident, and an early date must biing many and liberal offers to construct one on moat favorable terms, with the same pri ority of use accorded to our government in return for such aid and protection as the present applicants request. Mr. Sumner's project of a bill to secure wages to ship wrecked seaman, and to annul all contracts forfeiting the game, in case of the ship's loss or failure to mike the cost of freight, is a good and timely werd for "Poor Jack," and indicates one element for the encouragement of the American mercantile marine that had been sadly overlooked. This suggestion was appropriately followed by a shipping bill from Mr. Wilson, encouraging the eligibility of American shipping for trade to foreign ports, and allowing not only drawbacks in their favor, but also an exemption amounting to a release of duties on machinery to be used in onr home maritime constructions. This looks, indeed, liko an earnest purpose to help our suffering marine and rebuild a commerce which in lSGJ had crept close into the wake of our one great rival and was whitening every sea with American canvas ? in other words, spreading the prestige and example of the republic throughout the world. Bills ex tending the time of application for discharge under the Bankruptcy act of March 2, 18G7, a most weighty and important amendment, and to create a Southern Judicial district in Cali fornia, were advanced, and memorials were presented soliciting compensation for property taken by the general government in certain Southern States. With this fair warrant of a working session the Senate determined to make the calendar the order of business, on and after Monday next, until completed, all bills to which there had been no objection made to come up as recorded and each Sena tor to speak but once and for five minutes only. The House took hold of solid purposes at the st irt with bills from Mr. "Sheldon, of Louisiana, to amend the Currency act of July 12, 1870 ; from Mr. Lynch for the gradual re sumption of specie payment j, and from Mr. McNeely to abolish the Freedmen's Bureau The proposition of Mr. Lynch challenges favorable examination as a method at least free of the comjtlicatad provisos that have overburdened and killed many of its prede cessors. It simply calls for the destruction of the old United States notes by the Treasury Department as they are received in the way of business, and their replacement by an equal issue of new notes, to be dealt ou* for disbursements, payable in specie after six months from date ; the national banks to redeem in the new United State3 notes, and the latter to be taken for duties on imports after they become receivable in coin. Scarccly, if at all, inferior to the above ia importance was the bill reported by Mr. Farnsworth, of the Tost Office Committer, to revise and amend the entire code of statute# relating to the Postal Department. Its speci fications cover no less than thirty-two pages of print, and form a " piece de resistance " over which the IIou3e whetted its teeth for the remainder of the morning hour, after sun dry resolutions, hereafter mentioned, had been offered and referred. Tho salaries of letter carrhra proved to bo the subject of tender solicitude, although nothing was said about the penny wise and pound foolish policy which results ia our Western bound mails being frequently left behind aloag the Penn sylvania railroads, owing to the alleged inade quate rates allowed for their transportation. Still, the laborer is worthy of his hire, and assuredly tho situation of a carrier in such cities as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco is no sinecure. The day is not dis tant, however, when, under just and far-see ing management, public employ 's who talk the most and do the least will find positions reversed. Satisfactory consideration is tho true secret of prompt and faithful perform ance. This is an axiom in the science of gov ernment. The provision with regard to tho detention of circulirsfor lotteries and "gift concerts" goes, perhaps, too far. However we may disapprove the vicious ^buse of the lottery system we are still more afraid of in vesting Post Office authority with the power of overhauling and detaining mail matter at will. It involves liability to fatal errors, and, in the case of many gift enterprises for chari tuble purposes, such as those which have been doing noble work in this city and elsewhere for the poor sufferers from the European war, might bo construed, by the caprice or preju dice of some t^sty official, into the detention of journals which publish and advocate such kindly undertakings. Mr. Sargent's amend ment, therefore, although rejected, was not ill-advised. Mr. Hill's advocacy of cheaper postage wis up wit'i tho Hp'rit of our time. The statistics of nil countries, our own in cluded, have conclusively attested the im mense advantages, comm >rcial and social, resulting from every r. -as jnaU i reduction i \ tho tax impose 1 upon lelt r commuoic itio ).
