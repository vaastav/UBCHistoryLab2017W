President McKlnlwy today sent his annual message to congress, congratulating It upon re assembling under felicitous conditions, calling for grateful acknowledgment to a beneficent Providence which has so sig nally blessed anl prospered us as a na tion, Peaco and good will 'with all the nations of the earth continue unbroken, tie Says. He also expresses genuine sat isfaction at the growing spirit of fra ternal regard and the unification of all flections of our country, upon the uni versal spirit of patriotism and the lift ing of great public questions above par ty prejudice and sectional difference. Contrary to the usual custom w'nich has led to tho treatment of matters of foreign relations in the beginning of the message. President McKinley devotes tils attention first to the financial ques tion, of which he says: The exiira. session of thi3 congress which closed during July last, enacted important legislation, and while its full effect has not yet been realized, what it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent value further time will be re quired, and the people, satisfied wiuh its operation and resuks thus far, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial. Tariff legislation having been settled by the ex-tra session of congress, the ques tion next pressing for consideration is that of the currency. OUR 

FINANCIAL SITUATION. "The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, ditticuit as it may seem, will appear easier when we recall the fi nancial operations of the government sine liGS. On the 13th of June of that year , ' we "had outstanding demand liabilities in ! the sum of $723,8.447.71. On the 1st of Jan uary, 1S97, thesa liabilities'nad been reduc ed to Ji43,S3'Jf4'J5.88. Of our interest-bearing obligations, the figures are even more striking. On July 1, 186tf, the principal of the interest-bearing debt of the gov ernment was $2,3J2,331,203. On July 1, 1893, this sum had been reduced to $5:i3,O37,OO0, or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,234,108. The interest-bearing debt of the United Staites on December 1, 1897, was $817,3G5, 620. TTne government money now out standing (December 1st), consists of $346,681,016 of United States noies, $107, 793,20 of treasury notes issued by au thority of the law of 1890; $384,903,504 of silver certificates and $Gl,280,7tl of stand ard silver dollars. "With t'ne great resources of the gov ernment and with the honorable example of the pajt before us, we ougmt not to hewita.te to enter upon a currency revis ion which will make out demand obliga tions less onerous to the government and relieve our financial laws from ambigu ity and doubL. The brief review of wnat was accomplished from the close of the "War i, i.iaK' - nmv6, -"ib!e groundless any distrust either of our luiai.nui ability ox ouu.nJi.oj vVm.e ...e ftituanion from 1893 to 1897 must admonish congieris of the immediate necessity of ;o iegisiating as to make the return of the conditions then prevailing impossible. "There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the eviS Before we can find t'he true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that our currency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good good because the govern ment's pledge is out to keep it so and that pledgo will not be broken. However, the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will be best shown by advancing toward its fulfillment. The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the government of maintaining the parity of our different forms of money; that is, keeping all of t'hem at par with gold. We surely cannot be longer heed less of the burden this imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperous con ditions, while the past four years have demonstrated that it is not only an ex pensive charge upon the government, but a dangerous menace to the national credit. THE 

DVILS OF THE PRESENT SYS TEM. "It is manifest that we must devise wome plan to protect the government against bond issues for repeated redemp tions. We must either curtail the oppor tunity for speculation, made by the mul tiplied redemptions of our demand obli gations, or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. We have $900,000,000 of currency, which the government by sol emn enactment has undertaken to keep at par vvlt'h gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem in gold but the government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold. The government is obliged to keep equal with gold all its outstanding cur rency and coin obligations, w'hile its re ceipts are not required to be paid in cold. They are paid in every kind of money 'but gojd and the only means by which the government can with certain ty get gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most needs it. The government without any fixed .gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and fatihfully done and which, under the au thority now given, it will continue to do. "The law which requires . the govern ment, after having redeemed Its United States notes to pay them out again as currency funds, demands a constant re plenishment of the gold reserve. This is specially so at times of business panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses of the government. At such times the government has no odher way to supply its deficit, and main tain redemption, but through the in crease of its beaded debt, as during the administration of my predecessor, when $262,315,400 of AVz per cent, bonds were is sued and sold and t'he proceeds used to pay the expenses of the government in excess of the revenues and sustain the gold reserve. While it is true that the greater part of the proceeds of these bonds were used to supply deficient rev enues, a considerable portion was re quired to maintain the gold reserve. "With our revenues equal to our ex penses, there would be no deficit requir ing t'he issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $100,000,000, how will it be replenished except by selling more bonds? Is there any ot'her way practicable under existing law? The seri ous question then is: Shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past; that is. When the gold reserve roaches the point of danger, issue more bonds, and supply the needed gold, or ehali we provide other means to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold re serve? If no further legislation is had and the poTrry of selling bonds is to bo continued, then congress s'hould give the secretary of the treasury authority to eoll bonds at long or short periods, bear ing a less rate of interest than is now Authorized by law. TO 

STOP THE DRAIN ON THE GOLD RESERVE. "I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts of the government are quite suf llclen't to pay all the expenses of the eovernment, that when any of the United States notes are presented for redemp tion, in gold and are redeemed In gold, uch notes shall be kept and set apart, and oily paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the cold and gets it from the government, he Should not receive back from the gov ernment a United , States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The rea son for this is made all themore ap parent when the government issues an parent when the government issues an nterest-bearinr debt to provide gold for M redemption of United State Dote- & non-Interest-bearing deht. Surely It should not pay them out attain except on demand, and for gold. If they are put out In any other way, they may re turn to be followed by another bond is sue to redeem them another interest bearing debt to redeem a non-interest-bearing debt. ''In my view, it Is of the utmost im portance that the government should be relieved from t'he burden of providing all the gold required for exchanges and export. This responsibility is alone borne by t'ne government, without any, of the usual and necessary banking powers to help Itself. The banks do not feel the strain of gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the government and the size of the gold reserve in the treasury has come to be, with or without reason, t'he signal of danger or of security. This ought to be stopped. "If we are to have an era of prosperi ty In the country, with sufficient receipts for the expenses of the government, we may feel no Immediate embarrassment from our present currency; but the dan ger still exists and will be ever present menacing us so long as the existing ej-s-tem continues. And besides It is In times of adequate revenues and business tran quility that the government s-hould pre pare for the worst. We cannot avoid serious consequences, the wise consid eration and prompt solution of this ques tion. T HE 

REMEDIES SUGGESTED. "The secretary of the treasury has out lined a plan in great detail for the pur pose of removing the threatened recur rence of a depleted gold reserve and save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this plan I invite your care ful consideration. "I concur with the secretary of the treasury in "his recommendation that Na tional banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one ! half of one per cent, per annum. I also j join him In recommending that authority be given for the establishment of na tional banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This will enable the smaller vil lages and agricultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet their needs. "I recommend that the issue of na tional bank notes be restricted to the denomination of $10 and upwards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the approval of congress, then I would recommend that national banks be required to redeem their notes In gold." THE CUBAN QUESTION. Turning to foreign affairs, the presi dent devotes a greiat part of 'his message to a consideration of the Cuban ques tion, which he says Is the most import ant problem with which this government is now called upon to deal pertaining to its foreign relations. The story of Cuba has for many years been one of unrest and for no enduring period has it ceas ed to cause concern to the United States. Briefly summarizing the story of for mer outbreaks and of the part played by General Grant in the last war, the pres ident, coming down to the present insur rection, speaks of its remarkable , in crease, its tenacious existence against the enormous forces massed by Spain, the widespread destruction of property, and the disregard of the civilized code of war no less by the Spaniards than by the Cubans. He says: "The existing conditions cannot but fill this government, and the American people, with the gravest apprehension. There is Vio desire on the part of our peo p'e to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire to see the Cu bans prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure of self-control v.'hich is the inalieanable. right of man, protected in their right to reap the benefit of the ex hau.stless treasures of t'heir country." Continuing, the president says that the offer made by his predecessor in April, 1S96, of t'he good offices of this govern ment failed. The cruel policy of con centration was initated in February, 1S9G. "It has utterly failed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare it was extermination," says the presi dent. Against this abuse of the rights of war he has felt constrained on repeat ed occasions to enter the firm and earn est protest of this government. He made instant demand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under ar rest, and before the change of the Span ish cabinet in October last, twenty-two prisoners, citizens of the United States, 'had been given their freedom. The instructions to Minister Woodford directed him to impress upon the Span ish government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid towards the ending of the war by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable alike to Spain and to the Cuban people. It was also asked whether Spain, of her own volition, moved by her own interests and sentiments of humanity, should not make proposals of settlement, and it was said that we could not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishment of this result. No solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humilita tfon to Spain could attach. All that was asked or expected, was that some safe way might be speedily provided and per manent peace restored. The president refers to the change in the Spanish cabinet about this time and continuing says: "The reply to our note was in the di rection of a better understanding. It ap preciates the friendly purposes of this government. It admits that our country is deeply affected by the Cuban war." It declares that the present Spanis'h government is bound by every consid eration to a change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuiba within a reasonable time. To this end Spain has decided to put Into effect To ere croffmla It ought to interest everybody to know that the terrible affliction called Scrofula is the forerunner of a st'll more terrible disease. Scrofula is the seed of consumption. It is so deep-seated and obstinate that not one doctor in a hundred can cure it. To cure Scrofula, you must cure the blood.

FAIRBANK COtSPANY, I (53ffi JltUlL5j Chicago Bt. Ixmta. New Tortc Boston. N"" H f -ff' Philadelphia. Ny . the political reforms heretofore advocat ed by the present premier, wrl'hout halt ing for any consideration in the path which in Its judgment, leads to peace. The military operations, it Is said, will continue, but will be humane and con ducted with all regard for private rights, being accompanied by political action leading to the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish sovereignty. It fur t'her suggests that .Spain be left free to conduct the military operations and grant political reforms, while the United States for Its part shall enforce neutral obligations and cut off the assistance which, it Is asserted, the insurgents re ceive from this country. The supposi tion of an indefinite prolongation of the war is denied and complete and early pacification is hoped for, which, with the immediate amelioration of existing con ditions in Cuba, would remove cause for any change of attitude on the part of the United States. Spain shows an appar ent disposition to charge us with failure to meet international duties, and this charge, says the president, is without any basis of fact. It could not have been made If Spain had been cognizant of the constant efforts this government has made at the cost of millions and by the employment of the administrative ma chinery of the nation to perform its full duty. That it has successfully prevent ed the departure of a single military ex pedition or armed vessels from our s'hore in violation of our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer and due response to this charge has been made in diplomatic course ' . ... Declaring that throughout all these horrors and dangers to our own peace, i?.n5KS5tivlatSf ir2SI?I.ra5rSif2 share in the highest franchises of em it PFa"?f. '2el12F1 a-P2S ' unship, and, having due regard to the according- to its own high sense t right and its interests, the president says: NO 

CAUSE FOR INTERVENTION. "Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents as belligerents, recognition of the independ ence of Cuiba: neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compro mise between the contestants, and inter vention in favor of one or the other par ty. I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot be thought of. That by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression." The president then' proceeds to discuss the first head, namely, the recognition of belligerency. He recalls t'ne iesuiu tions of congress in 1S9S and since; he quotes the wise utterances of President Grant in his message of December 7, 1875, particularly where he declares against t'he recognition of independence at that time, and also President Grant's declaration that he failed to find in the Insurrection the existence of such a sub stantial political organization and other elements required by international usage as would place it on the terrible footing of war to which a recognition of bellig erency would aim to elevate it. Com pleting his quotation from that portion of President Grant's message t'he presi dent says still further pertinent consid erations appear as to the practical as pects of the question. In the code of nations there is no such i'hing as a naked recognition of belligerency, unaccompa nied by the assumption of international neutrality. Such recognition would not confer upon either party to the conflict a status not theretofore 'actually pos sessed and a recognition of belligerent rig'hts, while nominally equal, would weigh heavily In behalf of Spain' herself. Spam could not only claim the right of search on the high seas and of seizure of frvn,trflhanfls hut her maritimo righto could be asserted up to t'he margin of our own territorial waters and a condi tion of things would exist for which the Cubans within their own domains could not hope to create a parallel. The United States would acquire no right of inter vention to enforce the conduct of the strife within t'he paramount authority of Spain according to the international code of war. "For these reasons." says the president, "I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and therefore inadmissi ble. Should that step hereafter be deem ed wise as a measure of right and duty, t'he executive will take it." The president then discusses the ques tion of intervention upon humanitarian grounds, and he asks whether this step should be taken w.hen it is apparent that a hopeful Change has supervened in the policy of Spain towards Cuba. He re calls that the new Spanish government has pledged itself to reform and an aban donment of the bayonet policy alone, and finds that the first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The policy of cruel rapine and extermi nation that has so long shocked the uni versal sentiment of humanity has been reversed. Broad clemency Is proffered; measures have been taken to relieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies, it is asserted, is to be used, not to spread ruin and desolation, but to protect the resumption of peace ful agricultural pursuits and productive industries. That past methods are futile to force a peace by subjugation is freely admitted, and that ruin without concili ation must inevitably fail to win for Spain the fidelity of a contented depend ency. Decrees in application of the fore shadowed reforms have already been promulgated. 

SPAIN'S REFORM POLICY. The president describes the reform pol icy of the Spanish government as to Cuba, as has 'already been set out in the press, aaid says: "That the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from whiten reces sion with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned: that in the few weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of its professions is undenia ble. I shall not impugn its sincerity nor should impatience be suffered to embar rass it in the task it has undertaken. It is honestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize 'her expectatior.3 and to -prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocabiy committed. She has recalled the com mander whose brutal orders inflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized world. She has modified the horrible or der of concentration and has undertaken to care for the helpless and permit those who desire to resume the cultivation of their fields to do so and assures them of the protection of the Spanish govern ment in their lawful occupations. She has Just released the Competitor pris oners heretofore sentenced to death and who have been the subject of repeated diplomatic correspondence during both this and the preceding administration. "Not a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of whom this government has any knowl edge. The near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace. Just alike to the Cubans and to Spain, as well as equitable to all our Interests so Intimately Involved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be at tained. If not. the exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken When that time comes that action would be determined in tne ih.e or indisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiv ing or hesitancy in I'iie light of the obli gation this government owes to itself, to the people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and honor, and to humanity. "Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourseves. actuated only by upright and patriotic considerations, moved nek'her by passion nor selfishness, the government will continue Its watch ful care over the rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of its efforts to "bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honora ble and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our ob ligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity, to intervene with force, it snail be without fault on our part, and only because the necessity for such ac tion will be so clear as to command the support and approval of the civilized world." 

ANNEXATION OF HAWAII. The president next takes up the sub ject of the annexation of Hawaii. He re fers to this subject because the senate has made public the treaty now pending, and legislation is required to settle many details of the eventual union, s'hould an nexation be accomplished, as he believes it should be. Rapidly reviewing the ar gument he -has heretofore made In favor of annexation, the president says "If the treaty is confirmed as every consideration of dignity and honor rc quires, the wisdom of congress wiil see l . k-.,J? f Omenta ,rhr t-aut vo Ktti n, geographical conditions, the most just provisions for self rule In local matters wii'h the largest poetical liberties as an integral part of our nation will be ac corded to the Hawiaiians. No less is due to a people who, after nearly five years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill . the obligations of self-governing statehood, come of their free will to merge their destinies in cur body politic." Of the dispute between Japan and Ha waii, growing out of the labor immigra tion, the president says: "The issue is now in a satisfactory stage of settlement by negotiation. Tnis government has not been inviied to me diate, nor 'has it sought to intervene, ex cept to evince its kindly disposition to wards a speedy, equitable and honorable settlement. It is also gratifying to learn that Japan is no longer apprehensive through annexation, of the loss or im pairment of her privileges, but places confidence in the uprigluness of this giv ernment and its purpose, to deal with all possible ulterior questions in the broad? est spirit of friendliness." 

CENTRAL, AMERICAN REPUBLICS. The president next refers to the de clination cf Nicaragua to receive Min ister Merry, because of the compact creating the greater republic of Central America. He said he could not accredit Mr. Merry to the diet, because the ap propriation law did not permit It. Mean while Mr. Baker, the present minister at Managua, Nicaragua, has been directed to present his letters of recall. Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter is likewise situated as to Guatamala and Honduras. Guatamala is not a member of the greater republic. but Honduras Is, and shou.d the latter ' decline to receive 'him, he will await in . uliiuu. 1 Tne president makes only the briefest reference to the Nicaragua canal as a subject of large Importance to our coun try and increasing appreciation on the part of the people. He says that the last commission is now making its in vestigations and. when he transmits his report to congress he will make further suggestions on t'he subject. 

INTERNATIONAL. BIMETALLISM. Coming to the question of an interna tional coinage agreement, the president states that the special envoys represent ing t'he United States in the effort to se cure such an agreement, have been dili gent in their efforts to obtain the co-operation of European countries, but up to this time have not been a"ble to secure an agreement contemplated by their mission. The gratifying action of France in Joining this country in the effort is regarded as an assurance that we are not alone among the larger nations of the world In the desire to reach some practical solution of the problem. Of the future of the negotiations, the president says: "Our special envoys have not made their final report, as further negotia tions between the representatives of this government -and the governments of oth er countries are pending and in contem plation. They believe that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters re specting the power of maintaining the stability of the parity between the jnetals and kindred, questions may yet oe soldved by further negotiation.';. Mean while it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have already de monstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject, and It is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in ar. International agreement which will bnng about recognition of 7oth gold and silver as money upon such terms and with such safeguards as will secure the use of both metals upon a basis whic'h shall work no Injustice to any class of our citizens." , 

RECIPROCITY. Turning to the subject of reciprocity, the president says that he has appointed John A. Kason, of Iowa, as a special commissioner to undertake the negotia tions, under the terms of the tariff act. He says: "The negotiations are now proceeding wii-h several governments, both Euro pean and American. It is believed that by a careful exercise of the powers con ferred by mat act, seme grievances of cur own ar.d of other countries in our mutual trade relations may be cither re jnoved cr largely alleviated, and that the volume of our commercial exchanges may be enlarged, with advantage to both contracting parties. OUR 

MERCHANT MARINE. "Most desirable from every standpoint cf national interest and patriotism is the f ffort to extend our foreign commerce. To this end our merchant marine should be Improved and enlarged. We should do our full share of the carrying trade of the world. We do not do It now. We should be the laggard no longer. The in feriority of our merchant marine is just ly humiliating to the national pride. The government by every proper constitu tional means should aid in making our snips familiar visitors at every commer cial port of the world, thus opening up new ana valuable markets to the sur plus products of the farm and the fac tory. THE SEALING QUESTION. Only a brief reference Is made to the negotiations that have been in progress to secure further protection for seal life. The president says that at the confer eoce Sxeld &ere upon tolx invitation be tween the delegates frca Japan, Xloxsia and the Unlteu btatee, it was unani mously agreed that under the existing regulations the seals were threatened with 'extinction, and that an internation al agreement was necessary for their adequate protection. While declining to participate in this conference. Great Bri tain sent expert commissioners to a suo sequent meeting in Washington. Tne president says: The result of this conference was an agreement on Important facts connected v.itn tne contrition of the seal herd, .here tofore in dispute, which should puice be yond controversy the duty of roe gov ernments concerned to adopt measures without delay for the preservation and restoration of the herd. Negotiations to this end are now in progress, the resuli of which I hope to be. able to report 'to congress at an early day. 

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION. Under the head of international arbi tration tne president says: "International arbitration cannot be omitted from the list of subjects claim ing our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen the general views on this question expressed In my Inau gural address. The best statement of the civilized world Is moving toward the set tlement of differences between nations without resorting to the horrors of war. Treaties embodying these humane prln- imperiling our Interests, or our honor shall have my constant encouragement." , i'ne president relets to tne unprece dented Interest shown by the peop- n the approaching Paris exposition. He speaks in flattering terms of the work accomplished by the United States spe cial commission and bespeaks a Judicious and liberal appropriation for a credita ble national exhibit. 

RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO NAVY. Coming to the subject of the navy, the president speaks In terms of high praise of the excellent character of our naval force. He regards it as of great im portance that congress should immedi ately provide for the armor for the three battleships now under construction. He recommends very little new construction. but says: The great Increase of the navy which has taken place In recent years was Jus tified by the requirements for national defense, and has received public appro bation. The time has how arrived, tow ever, when this Increase, to which the country Is committed, should, for a time, take the form of Increased facili ties commensurate with the Increase of our naval vessels. It Is an unfortunate fact that there Is only one dock on the Pacific coast capable of docking our largest ships, and only one on the At lantic coast, and that the latter has for the last six or seven months been under repair, and, therefore, incapable of use. Immediate steps should be taken to pro vide three or four docks of this capaci ty on the Atlantic coast, at least one on the Pacific coast and a floating dock in the gulf. This is the recommendation of a very competent board, appointed to In vestigate the subject. There should also be ample provision made for powder and projectiles and other munitions of war and for an increased number of officers and enlisted men. Some additions are also necessary to our navy yards, for the repair and care of our larger number of vessels. As there are now on the stocks five battleships of the largest class which cannot be completed for a year or two. I concur with the recommendation of the secretary of the navy for an ap propriation authorizing the construc tion of one battleshlp for the Pacific coast, where, at present, there is only one in commission and one under con struction, while on the Atlantic coast there are three in commission and four under construction: and also that several torpedo boats be authorized in connec tion with our general system of coast defense." 

ALASKA. The territory of Alaska is said to re quire the prompt ana early attention of congress. Tne conditions now existing demand material changes in the laws and much remains to be done for that vast and remote, yet promising portion of our country. If, in the ensuing year the conditions Justify it, the additional land district authorized by law will be established with -an office at some point in the Yukon valley and an appropria tion Is now necessary for 1'hat purpose. The president concurs with Secretary Alger as to the necessity of a military force In the territory, and also urges the establishment of some flexible system of government. Referring to the startling. though possibly exaggerated reports of the probable shortage of food for the miners, the president says that although access to them in the winter is a most difficult and perhaps Impossible task, yet If these reports be verified, every effort at any cost should be made to carry them relief. 

INDIAN TERRITORY. Reference Is made to the fact that there Is no provision for the protection of rig-ht or property of the many w'hite citizens now in the Indian Territory: that thousands of their children are of school age, but the doors of the schools of the nation are closed against t'hem It 13 said that leading Indians have ab sorbed great tracts of land to the ex elusion of the common people and the government by Indian aristocracy has been practically established. The work of the Dawes commission Is succinctly described. It is that the Choctaws and Chickasaws have ratified the agreement reached by the commission, and if the other tribes of the nation failed to enter into similar arrangements, then legisla tion must be had. for, says the president. I concur with the secretary of the In terior that there can be no cure for the evils engendered by the perversion of A Shattered Horvous System.

KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD. The message deals briefly with the history of the Pacific railroad sale of the past season. It is said that the upet price on the sale of the Kansas Pacific will yield rhe government 1.!0J,CX) over all. and if no better bid Is made, that Is ail. that the government will receive on Us claim of -nearly JlXOCM.a). It Is not known whether a better bid will b re ceived, so the question presented la whether the government shall not pur- j chase or redeem the road In rhe event that a bid Is not made by private par ties covering the entire government claim. The president nays he believes he has the authority to do this, and unices congress lakes action he ffhall direct the secretary of the treasury to drposlt the fcAa required to qualify a a bidder and to bid a sum equal to the principal of the debt due the government, lie suggests, however, the passage of a law immediately, expressly covering thl case, saying that "while It Is clear to his mind t'hat the government should not permit the property to be sold at a prica which will yield less than one-half of the principal of Its debt, and ls than one-Ufth of Its entire debt, pnnrip.il and interest, yet whether the government should become the owner of the property ne suomoLs to congress. 

CIVIL SERVICE. The last topic treated In the tnenmx is the civil service, which the preaKlent says, has of late years received Increas ed legislative and executive approval. During the past few months the nervlo has been placed upon a still firmer boi of personal merit. The right of veteran soldiers to reinstatement has been as serted, dismissals for political reason have been carefully guarded against, the examinations Improved ami made more practical, and a distinct advance ha been made by giving a hearing before dismissal, upon charges of Incompeten cy. This last has In no way impaired the power of removal, whic'h Is one of the vital safeguard of the civil service system. Much remains to be sceorn plished to make this system reasonably perfect. There are places now In the service which ought to be exempted from classification and ofhers not classified may properly be Included. The presi dent says he shall not hesltatae to cor rect these faults In the Interest of pub lic service. The system has the approval of the ieop3e and it will bo his endeavor to upho'd and extend it. T'he message concludes with an ad monition from the president to congress to cart-fully scrutinize the estimates of the expenses of the government and not to encourage their increase, tut It is the commanding duty to keep the appropri ations within the receipts of the govern ment and thus aviod a deficit.
