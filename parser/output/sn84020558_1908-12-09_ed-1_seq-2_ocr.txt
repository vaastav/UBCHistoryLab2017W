The message of President Roosevelt may be regarded as another contri bution to the many causes for the rapid return of prosperity. In all its parts it may not meet the unquali fied endorsement of all the people of the country or of all the leaders of the republican party. It would be marvelous if a message containing so many recommendations, some of them of a sweeping character, should i not fail of even unanimous party en dorsement. There will, however, probably be little heard of 'disapproval, since it was not the expectation of the pres ident that many of his recommenda tions would be enacted into legisla tion within the brief remaining period of his term. The message was deliv ered rather as something for con gress and the country to think over. His plea for a centralization of the power for the control of corpora tions doing an interstate business will encounter little or no opposition in his own party or among the corporations themselves who have suffered greatly within the last two years from the inharmonious efforts of the states to regulate them with the result of gen eral confusion and no benefit to the public. The remarks of the president con cerning the courts, generally commen datory, and needed judicial reforms are conservative, fair and well timed, intended for the protection of the dignity and the influence of the judi ciary as well as for the protection of the public against the happily few unjust or narrow-minded judges. The reasonable workingmen of the country cannot complain of a want of the president's zeal in. their behalf. He naturally does riot recommend all that labor agitators demand but what he advocates is 'calculated to afford the laborer greater protection of life and health, more remunerative em ployment, and a surer position In the industrial world. What the president withholds and what the agitators demand would make him less of an American citi zen and more a member of a priv ileged class or clan. In dealing with our insular posses sions the president overwhelms the arguments of democrats and anti-im-lerialists who demand the immediate leaving of the Filipinos to their own devices. It Is pointed out that we have a duty in those Islands to per form, a duty which overshadows the theory that all men arte entitled tf govern themselves whether capable of doing so or not a doctrine of irrc sponsibility. The message contains a plain inti mation to Cuba that we are responsi ble for jits good conduct; that when ever its people demonstrate their in capacity to govern themselves they must be governed from the outside. lA'.ss space is given to the army and navy than might have been ex pected, though the well known views of the president regarding needed re forms are clearly reflected, but, as was expected the subject of the con servation of our natural resources is fully and ably dealt with. As to ourselves, we find especial cause for gratification in the mes sage in the paragraph advocating separate statehood for the territories. This does not come as a surprise, however pleasant to us, for we had been apprised directly from the 'White House that such a recommendation would appear; that it would not be a mere formal recommendation but that it would have back of it the president's earnest wish for the ad mission of the territories and that it would be supplemented by his active efforts in our behalf. Xo one can controvert the argu ments of President Roosevelt in his message in favor of a wise conser vation of the forests. Nor can one believe that the disasters following reckless deforestation can be exag gerated. It was hardly a happy thought, though, to contrast the pres ent treeless condition of China with the mulberry-clad hill-, which Marco Polo saw in Cathay in the latter half of the thirteenth century. That trav eled Venetian saw a great many many things that would be sought for now in vain, on the "earth, in the heavens above or in the waters that be under the earth." UN ION ( S)cA HFt If it should come to pass that the interstate commerce sommisson shall assume regulation of the telegraph and telephone companies, we shall demand an adjustment of the wires between Phoenix' and Maricopa to damp or threatening weather. We shall also refer to the commission the offense of the girl at central who shouts "Number! Number! Num ber!" at you, as well as the crime of her sister who languidly 'informs you that the "line's busy." If we were Castro with $25,000,000 cached away in Europe we could be indifferent to revolutions and counter revolutions in Venezuela. The stren uous life Mr. Castro has led entitles him to the enjoyment of the fruits of honest toil. The prices that Salt River valley oranges are bringing in New York indicate that they are somewhat more golden tinted, a little sweeter and a little jucier than any others. The great mistake made by the de fense in the Ruef case was In not getting the angel wings of the de fendant before the jury' in the shape of "Exhibit A." We suppose William is still em peror of Germany though it has been so lrtng since he was last heard from that several things might have hap pened. The time has passed when a bicycle race, even a six-day race, can entice the American people away from their meals. 

ACTIVE WORK IN CONGRESS (Continued from page 1.) designed to afford complete machin- j ery by which, should we be con fronted with a foreign war, the exec utive power could proceed at once to transform enthusiastic and patri otic citizens into efficient and or ganized soldiers. Happily there is at present no cloud upon our horizon but that very fact affords us the best opportunity to proceed with de liberation and care in the preparation of laws adequate and indispensable for our possible war needs." It is pointed out by the president that the proposed measure would not call for a dollar of expenditure dur ing years of peace and its enactment into law now "would merely be to place at the disposal of the executive, the power and machinery whereby, should war threaten, the means to wage it could be swiftly brought into being." The proposed bill Is elastic; under its provisions a force of 2,000,000 men could be raised as well as one of 50.000. " .' 

RATE BILL AMENDMITS. Washington, Dec.. 8. Several Im portant amendments to the Hepburn railroad rate law were proposed in bills introduced today by Representative Townsend of Michigan, one of the most active advocates of remedial leg islation along interstate commerce lines. One of the bills gives to the inter state commerce commission power to prohibit the tacking on an advance of rates in cases where shippers individ ually or collectively protest against the advance, prior to the expiration of the legal thirty , days' notice. The bill places the burden on the carrier to show at a subsequent hearing that the proposed rates are just and reason able. Representative Townsend also would give the shipper the right and priv ilege of routing and prescribing the connecting lines the shipment should take. Another amendment provides that carriers shall quote rates in writing upon publication and give rates upon bills of lading and the rates be reck oned thereon. In the event error is made in the rate it is provided that claims for recovery shall be made only through the interstate commerce commission. ALLEGED COAL CONSPIRACY New Trial Wanted For the U. P. and Others Salt Lake, Utah, Dec. 8. Counsel for J. M Moore, and Everett Ruckham, the Oregon Short line, the Union Pacific railroad, and Union Pacific Coal com pany in the United States district court moved today for a new trial of the case against his clients. It was claimed that the verdict of the jury finding the defendants guilts of conspiracy for restraint of trade in withholding coal shipments from D. J. Sharp was not in accord with the evi dence. The motion was taken under advisement by Judge Marshall. YUMA EXCITED Yuma, Ariz., Dec. 8. A special meet ing of the Commercial club today re solved itself into a mass meeting thor oughly aroused over the prospective terminal rates. The people assembled in such crowds that they were obliged to adjourn to the city hall. An organized movement was estab lished for the preparation of a proper demand upon the interstate commerce commission for an investigation to de termine whether Yuma is not a com petitive point with water transporta tion.
