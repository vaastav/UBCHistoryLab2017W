The first of January is, to them, the dawning of a darker dsj for their prospects thr.n . ny th;y hare yet seen. And there are strong indications that they hare eontem . plted terms of peace before that time, to avoid tie certain defeat whicn mast oome Uiereafier. - We hare already referred to the statements of the New York Tribune . t'at negotiations had been opened between kding Democrats of New York and th '1 ' h n V i t ' H . T iolimnnyl , i, viW n settlement. This statement ' received strong corroboration from Fernando Wood, the leader of the tones in New York, in .a : speech last Saturday night. He said that be "had received information, and had communicated it to Government, that, an- . der lertain circumstances, the South were : : ' : . ... ..j u. 1. - 1 I l.l V from leading statesmen of the South. Men 1 ' of position and influence in the Confeder- ' . acy had expressed desire to return nn- : der a Democratic rule, - the past to b for - gotten, the pnblio debt on both sides to be ;' provided for, and. they were willing to let bygenes be bygones, if the North would, and the Union be odoo mors restored." . "Such is the substance of what Wood and bis Southern allies would make the basis of naacc. It was hardlv necessary to hint - t the assumption of the rebel debt, after - stating that they would come back " un : der Democratic rale," for any concession ' to the South would be in order under such a state of thinirs. But that reservation of "Democratic! rule," is of itself too much for the proposal to be received with any favor by the people of the North. No 1 . the rebels went out and made war under ' Republican rule, and under Republican rule they must be made to come back. ' There is not yet any chance for condition al peace. They must acknowledge the au thority of the Government as administered by the Republican administration of Abra ham Lincoln, or we will fight them until tluw . 1a . Wa rln tint, timmm . ri.tvMMftcr Lincoln and putting Wood, or Seymour, or - Vallandigham into the Presidential chair, . for the sake of receiving their gracious ad herence. Let them acknowledge the same - authority which they have spurned, and ' ' 4l Ml i.TV I - tlnm wen w win u&ie, w uicm. ;-:' ' But there is yet another proposal of set '. tlement. A dispatch to the New York Bunday Mercury says that it is reputed UiC JGUGLD) w. v " J Proclamation, and the immense armies we - have in the field, have made overtures to -' treat upon the following terms : V " 1.- The old Union and the old Constitu .. tion. : 2. Tht Crittenden Compromite. : 8. Tke tutumption of the Southern Debt. 4. The ordering of the French out of Mexico, and the annexation of that country . .for nine slave ttatet. The audacity of this proposal renders It i not improbable that something like it has ' r emanated from the rebels. But tSey should ' ' at least have proposed terms which were ; consistent with themselves. Inasmuch as . the Crittenden TJompromise proposed an - amendment to the Constitution, that and "the Old Constitution" cannot well be had ; J at the same time. It was the North which : ' desired the Constitution unchanged, and ' the South which desired to change it. As to the payment of the rebel debt, that can best be paid by con&scating the . property of traitors. That is the quickest, ' most equitable and most justifiable course of treatment - Considering that the present Adminis tration came into power upon a platform one of the main planks of which was "no jnore slave territory," the proposed re- : quisition of Mexico for the purpose of j carving it up into nine slave States, will not be likely to find much favor, either , with the Administration or the people. Upon the whole, there is not much " chance for the rebels to prevent the opera tion of either our army or the Proclamation by any such propositions of peace. The President's Message will show them the futility of any such hopes. The President's Visit to Burnside. A correspondent of the New York Times, says that the visit of the President to Gen eral Burn side, had reference to the delays ' which have taken place in the transports . . tion of supplies to that officer. It is known that Bnrcside was disappointed on r riving at Falmouth, not to find his pontoon bridge and other necessaries. The Presi ' dent went down to see about it to ascer , tain precisely where the responsibility for this failure rested, te assure General . Btrrnside of his steady and hearty support ' to renew promises of all the supplies 1 and reinforcements he might need, and to tell him that, whatever might be the pres- -sure upon him, he wished him to fight no -: incentive battle there. The visit was in " tended and calculated to aid General Burn " side's advance. Rev. Mr. Bella aaa) kit Cfcarca. From the New York Tribune we quote the following item, which will be of inter est to the many friends of Rev. James -Eells:" ' ' . , ' ; "The Dutch Reformed Church on the Eights, Brooklyn, formerly under the pas . toral care of the law Rev. Dr. Bethune, ' now ably ministered to by Rev. Dr. Eells, - has been for several years laboring under an incubus of debt amounting in all to '$22,076.24. On Tuesday evening, fifty members of the congregation met to Con sider the subject. Their deliberations re sulted in a subscription for the whole - amount, payable on Monday, the 1st of December. The number of subscribers was Just fifty, making an aveaageof $541 each. Chis is something to give thanks for." Deceased Soldiers.

CLEVELAND, -WEDNESDAY MORNING. DECEMBER 3. 1862. m. 288. The Secretary and the Soldiers. It is about twenty years since one of the members of the present Cabinet was a member of. Congress from, a distant west ern State. He had the usual right of des ignating a single candidate for admission to the West Paint Military Academy. The applications made t him for a vacancy which then existed were not many, but among them was a letter from a boy of six teen or seventeen years of age, who with out any accompanying recommendation or references, asked the appointment for himself. The member dismissed the ap peal from his mind, with perhaps a passing thought of the forwardness and impudence of the stripling who could aspire to such a place on no other grounds than his own desire to get a good education at the pub lic expense. . . - But happening a short time afterwards to be in the little village whence the let ter was mailed, the incident was recalled to his memory, and he thought he- would beguile the few hours of leisure that he had by looking up the ambitious youth. He made his way, by dint of much inquiry, to a small tailor's shop on the outskirts of the town. .. Whan he was admitted at the door he found a lad sitting cross-legged upon the tailor's benoh, mending a rent in an old pair of pantaloons. But this lad had another occupation besides his manual toil. Near by, on a small block of wood, rested a book of abstruse science, to which he turned his eyes whenever they could be transferred from the work in his hands. The member accosted him by the name given in the letter, and the lad replied " I am the person." "You wish, then, to be appointed a cadet at West Point ?" "I do," he rejoined. " Why" asked the Congress man. "Because," answered the tailor youth, " I feel that I was born for some thing better than mending old clothes." The member talked further with him, and was so pleased with his frankness, his spirit, and the rare intelligence he evinced, that he procured him the appointment. The member is now Secretary Smith, of Indiana, and the youth General fiurnside, Commander-in-Chief of the army of the Po tomac. We should not be surprised if that boy an excellent specimen of our North ern mudsills were destined to hoist the American flag to its old place on the Cap itol at Richmond. JT. T. Eve. Pott. The Secretary and the Soldiers. The American Minister and the Life Boat Service. [From the London Post, Nov. 1.] During the fearful gales that prevailed in the Irish Channel on Sunday night week, the American skip Ann E. Hooper, of Baltimore, was driven on theHorsebank on the Lancashire coast. Immediately the perilous position of the ship was seen Mon day morning, the Lytham lifeboat of the National Life Boat Institution was launch ed and towed to windward by the Loch Lomond steamer. After having been cast off by the steamer, the lifeboat had to go through a tremendously heavy sea of brok en water, which filled her three times, but which was rapidly self ejected. With very great perseverance on the part of the crew, she at last reached the ship, and with much difficulty took oS thirteen of the crew and a Liverpool pilot who was on board. - ; After taking off the fourteen men, -the rope by which the lifeboat was held to the ship parted, but the Southport lifeboat which also belong to the National Lifeboat Institution, fortunately came np at the time and took off the Captain and the re maining three men, - On the Hon. Charles F. Adams, the American Minister at this Court, being informed of the rescue of his countrymen, he communicated to the Na tional Lifeboat Institution his satisfaction with the great service rendered to the crew of the ship Ann E. Hooper by the lifeboats of that valuable society. He add ded that he would take oare that an ac count of the facts of the case should be brought under the notice of the United States Government. - A Rich Specimen of Orthography. Printers are expected to correct and straighten the most outrageous chirogra phy and orthography. The editor of the Van Wert Bulletin had a job sent in to him a few days ago for a " fancy job." The parties complaining of its style, after it was done, he publishes the original manu script, verbatim et literatim, in vindication. We guess those fellows won't complain again. Here is the "copy" from which he was to set np a fancy job ' "Great Champing gig Dance be twin C. Carris and g. grady mr Carris from Cleve land ohio Chaling by Carris to mis grady $25.00 this grate triel Dance is to by at the Echange House Tuesday Ere.

The Unjustifiable Course of the British Press. The Toronto Globe, always honorable and candid, thus speaks of the course of the English press upon American affairs : " But we cannot help saying that the course of many of the British press ex cuses, if it does not justify the action of the few lork press. What could, for ex ample, be worse than the wish expressed by the Leader of this city, a few days ago, that Britain would interfere to secure the independence of the South an interfer ence which would almost certainly be fol lowed by a bloody war between the two countries, in which Canada would be the battle-ground? Is it strange that bitter language should be used by American journals towards Britain, when British presses openly proclaim their willingness to run the risk of a war with the United States, in order to rivet the ohains of four millions of slaves ? . How can we expect good feelings from Americans when our writers make such a display of malevo lence?": : .:- . - Press. The Ohio Relief Association at Washington. A correspondent of the Gaiette writes: "The Ohio Relief Association has adopted a plan to assist Ohio soldiers in reference to their pay, &c, and to prevent impositions upon them. They hare an agent, a young discharged soldier, at a very low price per month, whose duty it is to be at the rail road depot,- and at the Soldiers' Rest where thousands of soldiers daily &n and to direct Ohio soldiers where to get' their pay, find lodgings or procure a meal, and te give them any information asked for. The young man has a badge on his hat, in la ge letters, " Ohio Soldiers' Be lief Association," and this attracts atten tion. He is kept busy, and is doing a good service for the Ohio soldiers. - It was a hap py device, and originated from the sugges tion of the Ohio soldier's friend, Mr. (ian geuer. It is probable that the other relief associations of Washington will adopt the same plan. It is 'worthy to be copied by all relief societies- in Washington and in all.our large cities. . , - . A Battle this Week.

New Method of Submarine Blasting. The Paris correspondent of the London Times, nnder date of Oct. 29, says: "Among the works going forward for the improvement of the ports of France, the new pier in progress or construction at Havre is one of the most remarkable, En gineers are now employed in removing the foundation of the tower of Francis I, and they take advantage of the high tides to spring the mines then covered with a great volume of water. They profit by the low water to remove the rubbish. A new sys tem has been introduced for the explosion of submarine mines. Engineers no long er make cavities in the rocks to contain the powder ; they merely place alarge glass bottle enclosed in a baBket at the bottom of the sea where they mean to act, and this bottle is filled with gunpowder in propor tion to the effect to be produced. The pressure of a column of water of some feet is sufficient to compress the gas so power fully as to cause great ravages on the soil on which the basket is placed, even were .it of the hardest granite. The gunpowder is ignited by electricity by means of two wires, which communicates the fire to the gunpowder, in the bottie. On Thursday morning laBt one of these submarine mines was sprung by the engineers of the roads and bridges, in presence of a multitude of spectators. The charge of gunpowder in the bottle was thirty pounds, when the explosion took place the water rose and formed an artificial waterspout, which fell on the surface of the water after pro ducing considerable undulation. The shock resembled an earthquake and was felt even In the town. The spectators as sembled on the breakwater felt it tremble nnder them as if it had been shaken by a submarine convulsion." An Appeal for the Southern Soldiers. " The Atlanta Confederacy makes the following appeal for the soldier : : i "Men and women of the sunny South- Did yon hear the keen wail as it shook the rafters and whistled through every crevice of your room last night ? Could y on sleep ? Did no ragged, cold, shivering soldier ran his long, oold hand over your face, and hies in your ear, 'Wake np ! how can you thus sleep, when I and thousands of your brave defenders, are facing these bleak winds!, with oar bodies half covered, our feet bare, and oar heads uncovered, and no gloves to prevent the skin of our hands from cleav ing to the cold steel ?' "Friends, in Heaven's name wake up, open your hearts. Go to work, make and give to the soldiers till you are conscious you have done yonr duty." It is proposed to have railroad ferry boat across the British channel from Dover to Calais. It is to be 8,000 feet long. It will run at a speed of 40 miles an hour, have rudders at both ends, be built of a series of fluted iron tubes, and have a cov ered iron tunnel in the centre into which the trains will be run.
