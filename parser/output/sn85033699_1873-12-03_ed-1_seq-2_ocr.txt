The protocol between Secretary Fish and the Spanish Minister, as it comes tons, is a hard piece of English. Our telegraph editor has made the most of it, but it is still as cloudy as the weather. The Telegraph reports a gratifying increase in the business of Macon, Ga, within a few days, and a revival in trade prospects generally. The Republican says the same maybe said of Savannah, where business is more cumbrous and less sensitive to the effect of outside in fluence. Dr. Beke has sent to tho London Times the following extract from a let ter recently received by a mercantile house from a resident at Borna, in Western Africa. It is dated Aug. 12, 1873: "I am proceeding, to-day or to-morrow, to Munuco, Upper Congo. In a few days we expect there the Liv ingstone expedition, which can not pro ceed from St. Salvador. Livingstone himself is a prisoner in a town twenty days from here, but is entirely without maans to pay his ranBom. Assistance has, however, been sent to him, and he may be here in a month or so." If Dr. Livingstone should be ransomed, he ought to be brought home, for it is questionable whether his " researches " will amount to very much. 

IIOW THE GOVERNMENT BOIATEK ED UP THE COOKES. The Milwaukee Sentinel, the leading Republican journal in "Wisconsin, 'in enumerating the causes of the Bepub 1 lican defeat in that State, says the Jay Cooke failure shook public confidence, and caused a loud demand for reform at "Washington. It appears from de velopments which are not disputed, that the government was in the habit of bolstering the Cookes in the most un warrantable ways. The Secretary of the Treasury allowed Cooke's bank in "Washington the use of large sums of money without security. Deposits of government money in other banks throughout the country were secured according to law, but the Cookes were made an exception. How could the government lose two hundred thousand dollars by the failure of the First Na tional Bank of "Washington, if the law had been complied with? And the sum lost might have been much larger had the suspension of the bank occurred at an earlier date. A cor respondent of the New York Sun makes a statement on the authority of the Hon. John Lynch, of Maine, who was a member of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, that there was atone time a government deposit of $7,600,000 in this same First National Bank. This was discovered during' the investigation last winter of the causes which led to the failure of the Mer chants' National Bank, of "Washington. It is also stated that the First National was at that time engaged in an effort to bolster up the tottering Merchants' at the government expense. "Whether or nofcthe deposit of 87,600,000 was fully secured it is impossible to say. The law requires that the Secretary of tho Treasury shall demand from all United States depositories ample se curity "in United States bonds and otherwise." The United States bonds must be put up aa security. If the law was violated in the case of the 3200,000 deposit, it may also have been violated -when there was a deposit of S7,600,000; and, if the crisis had come then, the Government would have been compelled to stand the larger loss. This case demands investigation, and it should not be delayed. The country should know whether the Secretary of the Treasury has been in the habit of depositing money in Cooke's banks without the security demanded by the law. If the Secretary is guilty of this unlawful proceeding, let the fact be made known, and let him be punished as he deserves. If he were a Democrat, the country would not be long in learn ing the exact state of the case, for there are Congressmen who would hardly have waited for an organiza tion to proceed in the matter of inves tigating so serious a charge. The fact that the Secretary is a Republican should not be allowed to screen him. AN AXAUAMA SENATOR. The subjoined confession, published inthe.Mbn70ieri Advertiser, shows the kind of stuff of which Radical Senators are often made in the Southern States: C. "W. Hatch is the Senator from Hale county elected by the negroes over the regular Republican nominee and a Democrat and to whose admission to his seat in the Senate when the Legis lature met a few days ago, unavailing opposition was made. This confession is fully sustained by official letters fully confirmingandrepeating it.ptisdueto Senator Harris, of Russell, to say thathe, though a Republican, raised the objec tion to Hatch and called for an investi gation before seating him; but the ma jority of his party were against him and they voted Hatch in. Here is Hatch's confession: Mobile, Ala., Jan. 4, 1871. I, Charles "W. Hatch, Postmaster at Greensboro', Hale county, Alabama, do confess that I have taken from the mails the following amount of money order funds, while in transmisaionfrom the following postoffices to the deposit ing office at Atlanta, Ga.: February 19 1870, from Greensboro', Ala., 8419; May 27, 1870, from Greensboro', Ala., June 22, from Greensboro', Ala., S12: June 25, 1870, from Greensboro', Ala 8105- June 30, 1870, from Tusca W Al 8500; July 6, 1870, from llx.W Total, $1,759.

In his first paragraph Gen. Grant throws out a bait for. the "Liberals' stating that "political partisanship has almost ceased to exist, especially in the agricultural regions," which is a neat way of glossing over the recent rebuffs of Radicalism. The offset of two mil lions of British claims against the fif teen millions we received, with the pros pect of more such offsets not only from Great Britain but from other nations, "will be sad news for the tax payer who learns it first from this message. The condition of the Texan border is slur red over with characteristic disregard of all Southern interests. San Domin go comes again to the surface in a short but suggestive paragraph, -while the right of expatriation is pretty well established. The reference to our Spanish troubles is rather brief and unsatisfactory, though its assertions of Spanish con cessions are positive far more so than the protocol accompanying. Half the space occupied is devoted to a doubt ful diagnosis of the Cuban situation per se, entirely out of place in a domes tic State paper. Through the officious Sickles we have been giving the Span iards too much of this advice unasked, and hence the reaction of their self conceit -which has incited them to pre cipitate present complications. The President devotes large space to finances and thepanic. The real causes of our commercial constipation are in geniously hidden in a cloud of com monplace truths, which Grant or his party have never attempted to reduce to practice. Some of the suggestions, which he fails to endorse, will arrest attention, while others will excite ridicule for instance, his fear that convertible bonds would make the government pay out more in terest in summer than in winter. Jay Cooke called the national debt a nation al blessing, and the President speaks of thepanic as "a blessing in disguise." But it is so thoroughly disguised that he does well to contradict this view by urging Congress to prevent if possible the recurrence of such blessings. There is brave talk of economy and an important but impossible step sug gested in civil service reform. "With this we have a wholesale whitewashing of the corrupt rings which haveswamp ed the fortunes of the District of Co lumbia, as well as the suggestion of residences for Cabinet officers at gov ernment expense, palaces for the Sena tors, etc. Brave talk of economy. It will not reach further than the Nash ville Customhouse. The suggestion of a riparian canal, running along the whole Atlantic and Gulf Coast, to protect our timid ship ping, fails to appear in this message. In its place looms up a big ditch from the Rocky Mountains to the Missouri river, designed to encourage migration to a barren desert, while millions on millions of arable land remain unoccu pied in the older States, and Iowa far mers complain of being too far from market. Surely the Northern Pacific has given our people a dose of this forcing business in the matter of premature settlements. The President urges the scheme of postal savings depositories, but con tents himself with a bare reference to the telegraph project. The amendment to the constitution which he suggests, in reference to leg islation during the last twenty-four hours of Congress, will meet with gen eral endorsement, and is the best point in this very verbose message. 

SOME INSTRUCTIVE FACTS. In all cases where the contest be tween the Democratic and the Repub lican parties in New York at the late election was a square one, the latter was beaten. To show this a compari son is made by the New York World be tween the votes which Mr. Nichols, Democratic candidate for Comptroller1, and Mr. Fort, Republican candidate for State Treasurer, received. These two are taken as the fairest basis of comparison, because neither was en dorsed by the Liberals. Their votes therefore gaveafair Ideaof the strength of each party. A comparison of the vote shows the following result: Vote for Nichols, Democrat 333,802 Vote for Fort.Repiiblican 329,235 Nichols in excess of Fort 4,507 Thus it will be seen that on a leading candidate in each party, neither of whom had the indorsement or support of the Liberals, the Democrats poll 4, 567 more votes than the Republicans. The case of Sweet against Taylor for the office of State Engineer was a much stronger one, and had the Liberal vote been given to the latter, as it was not, it would have failed to save him. The Btrengthof the Liberals, or rather of those who cling to that organization, is shown by a comparison of the vote for Mr. "Willers and Mr. Nichols on the Democratic side, and Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Thayer on the Republican side: Willers, Democrat, indorsed by the Liberals, received 341,090 Nichols, Democrat, who was not so indorsed, received u.w,oi The Liberal vote for 3!r. "Willers. . 7,294 Hopkins, Republican, indorsed by theLibetals, received ,337,975 Thayer, Republican, wlio was not indorsed by the iioerais, re ceived 330,475 Liberal vote for Mr. Hopkins 7,500 Thus the managers of the Liberal par ty have been able to control a few more than 7,000 votes. The former Liberal vote was not all cast for the Liberal ticket; thousands of those who cut looe from the Administration Repub lican party last year have cast their vote with the Democratic party and voted the entire ticket, and will hence forth act and work with the Democrats, with an earnestness and conviction that indicated perfect satisfaction and trust in the party and cause of reform to which they hud attached thomselyes. The official returns of the Wis consin ejection completely nega tives the pretense set up by the Administration organs that the re, Bult in that State was brought about by the Republicans staying away from the polls. They show," affirmatively and positively, that it was a victory for the reform party gained bolely by the posi tive strength of that party in the State. A comparison of the State election of 1873 with that of 1871 both what the in politics exhibits the tollowing facts: " 1871. ' 1873. "Washburn 78,301 1 Taylor 81,035 DooHttle 08,910 Washburn.. 00,254 Total 147,211 Total 147,859 This comparison of the votes for gov. emor shows an increase of the whole .number of votes cast in 1873 over 1871 of G18 votes. The Chica go Times says "The increase is wholly on the side of the reformers; on that of the admin' lRtratin-niHtB. the returns show a COD spicuous loss of positive as well as of relative popular strengtn. xn ion Wfwhbnrn received 78.301 votes; in 1873, this pretended 'farmers' friend: and 'best Governor "Wisconsin ever had,' received only 66,224 votes, and fbft vnfcpn rnvfiii to the other adminis- trationist candidates show this to be within 2,000 of the utmost strength of me attminiB irauoiuH t pnrujr m jdwu.- sin. In 1871, Doolittle, as tne uemo era tic' candidate, received 68,910 votes in 1873, and in the first electoral con test of the new reform organization the reform candidate for Governor re oeWaa SI fiSS vnfpH n. maioritv of 15.' 411 over his administrationist oppo nent, and mcluding a positive acces sion to the popular strength of the op nnn turn nf 12.725 votes; An examuia ttrm nf fliA official tables further shows that in only eleven counties was the number of votes riven for "Washburn in 7a fhnn thi number he receiv ed in the same counties in 1871, while in forty-seven counties, the administra tionist candidate received more votes than he received in the same counties in 1871. On the other hand, in forty fivfl counties the reformers cast more votes in 1873 than the 'Democrats' cast in the same counties in 1871, and in thirteen counties cast fewer votes in 1873 Tinn in 1871. Everv wav. and by every comparison that can be made, the evidence is clear and unavoidable, showing not merelv a relative victory. but a positive victory, won by positive superiority of numbers." The Boston Eerald hits the nail on the head when it says: Had Horace Greeley been elected President, and the panic had come, how every anti-Greeley oracle in the land would have cried aloud, "I told you so." In fact, they did demonstrate in advance that the election of Greeley would shake the whole fabric of the public credit and plunge the country into bankruptcy and ruin. It is a singular fact that all the evils they predicted under Greeley have come under Grant, and it seems to in dicate that the organs are cross-eyed. At a meeting held in New York at an early day of the late financial troubles, Judge Pierrepont, one of the staunchest supporters of the Grant ad' ministration, said: "Our troubles come of a vicious system of finance, which has atiniulat ed foreign imports, led to luxury and extravagance m every walk of life, Truth now asserts her sway, and sham crumbles into dust; and the day of reckoning has come, and the insane rev elry must bo paid for." Our "vicious system of finance'' is of Republican parentage, and has been hitherto lauded to the skies by Repub lican orators. What have Judge Pierre pont's Republican brethren in Con gress to say now. THE 

CURREXCT QUESTION. Washington, Nov. 30. Thero is an un mistakable feeling in favor of some en largement ol the currency, mose wno have canvassed most carefully claim that free banking and an incontrovertible bond will in the House have from thirty to fifty maioritv. Plans are numerous, but a ma jority turn on this pivot, though the mode is made to serve either tneory. -Uie na tional bankins interests are also aroused, and the conservative influences of the com mercial centers is being visibly rallied There seems little doubt that, outside of Boston. New England will be largely in favor of an increase. 3Ir. Sumnerwillfavor the measure of incontrovertible bonds and free banking, making the banks redeem in greenbacks, the government to redeem these in gold or bonds, me west ana oouin and rural members generally are almost solid in favor of some form of expansion. New Jprsey, New York, Pennsylvania and the leading cities are said to oppose, "OCEAN PERIES." Underfills heading, the Cincinnati Times publishes this fine bit of word-painting: There is something inexpressimy sau ami dreadful about the idea of a wreck far out at sea. All the elements ot the sublime, the mysterious, and the awful are united in the destruction of a ship upon the ocean by collision, fire, or storm; or, more terrible yet, wrecked upon the breakers, gored and ground to pieces by the cruel rocks, rent and torn hv tlie screaming hurricane, and sucked down by thefoaming.swirlingwhirl- pools. And how awful is the cloud ot mystery that surrounds the fate of those ships that sailed away to sea and never re turned! From the lofty deck, as the snowy sails were shaken out and caught the bracing morning breeze, depart ing Joyed ones waved us a fond f arewell, and the last flutter of a handkerchief is seen tlirough tears that bjur and dim the vision. Then come the montlis of waiting; at first, calmly, hopefully; then with a vague uneasiness which is more than lialf pre sentiment; then with open anxiety, dread uncertainty, and at last fixed despair. What a grim and horrible pathos is in all tliat! What imaginings haunt them who saw those who were held dear go out from shore in that ill-fated ship that was never heard of again! What dreadiul pictures will the horrified imagination draw of the scene when that gallant ship went down in mid ocean! A sky as black as in, save when vivid tongues of flame dart thrpugh the sable pall. Clouds and sea are com mingled in hideous uproar; the mad dened ocean bojjs and roars and tosses its foaming crests to the sky. Amid this war of winds and waves, in the thick darkness, in the ghastly glare of tho light ning, the (loomed ship is straggling like a living thing for life, now forced to the sum mit of a mountainous wave, caught by the shrieking, howling winds, whirled about, torn, butletted, then dragged down by the waters again, as though they envied the winds their chance to torture her, into the black depths of the trough, crushed, pound ed, whelmed, until she straggles up again, like a poor wounded thing, ainqng the bay ing, snarling hounds? Soon tlie unequal conflict is over, 3ir)g)ed with the roar of the elements, sounds the slfrilj, terrible cry that only a hunian oul sends forth when it looks at last into the very face of death; and the winds and water? are howling in triumph over the grave of thoir victim.

No woman can say truthfully that she does not care whether she is pretty or not. Every woman does care. The immutable laws of her being have made physical attractiveness as much natural glory to her as strength is to a man. T I T i 11 il i 1 -w iiere i may oe tola that what l am saying is superfluous, for perfect beauty has no need of art to enhance it, and that those who have been born with hard, or worse, with perfectly uninter esting features, do not want to be told that physical attractiveness isindispen sable to them. But it is especially to the plain, and to the generally ill- favored that I address these words of advioe and warning, and should Beau ty's self find a few usef id hints, I see no reason why she should not avail her sett ot them, i know that there are people who look well anywhere and anyhow no vulgarity, no carelessness of speech, dress or attitude seems able to oisencnann mem. nuz tnese rareiy gifted persons are but the exceptions that prove the rule, and even in their case what Sir Philip Sidney spake is true ne says mere is in mat weu-cnos en surroundings "Which does even beauty beautify, And most bewitched the captiveu eye;" and Herrick, too, in his "Poetry of Dress," seems to have had an astute appreciation of how beauty may be beautified. These men lived in the six teenth century a time when color m dress was an understood and valued ad junct, and before we had learned to make our dwellings intolerable to the eye. - An immense number of ill-tempered, ugly women are ill-tempered because they are ugly. They do not know it; their friends don't understand, and make no allowance; but heavy, indeed, is the burden upon these poor women, and pernicious m its effect upon their moral character very often. 1 have heard it said that ugly women are always bad tempored. This is an over statement; but there is a certain degree of truth in the saying, cruel as it is An ugly child cares nothing for its ug liness; but when it grows older, and perceives that it lacks something which is prized and honored, and is twitted with the deficiency, and neglected through it, and is reminded of it every time it looks in the glass or in another face, the constant disap pointment begins very early to embit ter the whole nature, and creates a mel ancholly shyness. And when the de sire to attract awakes with years, and the young girl finds her fairer friends preferred before her, the vain endeav ors to please by other means dishearten her, and she grows sarcastic, ill-natured, envious of everybody, though half un consciously; many other faults follow, ana she becomes unnappy ana morose. No one ever knows what she suffers; but she does suffer very acutely. I am certain that however laudable the efforts of ugliness to attract by learning, by accomplishments, by gen era! usefulness, or by satire, nothing really compensates for the want of per sonal beauty. The best that an ugly woman can do is to make you forget that sue is ugly ior tue time Demg; she cannot compensate. And while I should adyise all women to become as intelligent and clever as they can whether they be plain or pretty, still I wish mere beauty were made more an acknowledged and honorable art than it is by all those to whom God has given eyes and an intelligent brain. It is not sin nor a folly to long, as every woman longs, to be lovely. She is so constituted, and her beauty "is a glory to her."
