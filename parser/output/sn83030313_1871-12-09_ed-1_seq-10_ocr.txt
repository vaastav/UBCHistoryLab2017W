No new tacts were elicited or change made in the direct testi mony. Much of the cross-examination related to an explanation by the witness ol the use of yellow Jessamine, which, it appears, is a favorite remedy with him. a lecture of the witness' before a medi ca) association was used by the counsel in tne ex amination. H was moat searching and embarrass ing, but Dr. Williams answered promptly and intel ligently every question without embarrassment, and, taking everything into consideration, was the heat witness I eyer saw on the stand. DH. CHEW'S KWDBNCK. At tan mfhutes alter two o'clock Attorney General Byater directed the calling of Dr. Chew, who aastoted in the pon-iuortem examination ol Gen eral Ketohum'a ovUv. He took the wituesa stand and testified aa follows.? f have been a practising physician for thirteen or fOnrteen years la Baltimore, and have occupied the chair of Materia Medics In the Medical University of Maryland lor eight years; at the request of Dr. Williams I assisted in making a post-mortem ex amination o( General Ketch urn's body; Professor Miles made It In chief; Dr. Win lams sua 1 were present aud assisted; we examined the abdomen first; found the liver, spleen, kidneys and alimentary canal beaithyt we round in the latter some evi dences ol congestion, but imperfectly marked; it contained a whitish, pulpy substance, consisting of mucus sad epithelium, streaked with bile; we re moved the stomach and placed it in a clean glass |ar, capable * holding about three pints; examined the cavity of the sknil and found therein some evi dences ol congestion in the nraln; portions of the brain and the npper spiral column were taken by Proicssor Miles ror microscopic examination; found pnncurorm congestion, took thej jar contain ing the stomach to the chemical department of the University of Maryland and leu it under charge or i)r.

OOULD NOT AB816N A SPECIFIC CAl'SK FOR DEATH; from all the symptoms narrated by Dr. Williams upon the witness stand and my own observation* l do not think U was a natural death, bnt that he died from artificial causes. It being tnree o'clock, Chief Justice Miller stated that the court would now adjourn until to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, when the examination of Dr. Cbew win be resumed. During the entire proceedings to-day Mrs. Whar ton and her daughter, although perfectly composed, seemed to watch tne proceedings with more than usual interest. Dimly through the veils that bid their face* from sight could be seen their earnest, piercing glances, alternating beiwcen counsel aud witnesses, as the actions or words ol each were di rected toward some important point iu the case. Indeed, the whole party accompanying Mrs. Whar ton seemed to deeply reel the Interest that was mo mentarily gathering around the progress of this trial. Mrs, Nugent, as yesterday, seemed more de pressed than the rest, aud FREQUENTLY 8HED TEARS. And this increasing Interest was not seared alone by the Immediate friends aud relations ol tne pris oner, but tne entire audience watched the pro ceedings with an eager, breathless interest which has heretofore been felt only by the few. At frequent intervals ladies sitting a Utile back in the room would rise up in their sears and lu almost breath less suspense lean forward to catoh, if possible, every utterance made by those managing tne case; and at times the stillness of tne crowded room was really painful. To-morrow the proceedings will undoubtedly be fully as important as npon any or the previous days of the trial. Professor Miles, who made the post mortem examination, and Professor Aiken, who anSJyped the stomach of General Ketoiam and found that tartar emetic had been administered, win go npon the Witness stand. No ope l* able as yet to auraii?* when the state will close frj case, but it is generally believed that it will rest by Thursday of next week. Several of its important witnesses are yet to go upon the stand, among whom are Mrs. Loney, Mrs. Hut ton's sister, the Kwho pat the glass containing lartar emetic fcr bocket and gave it to Dr. Williams.- Her tes TUE LINE OF THE DEFENCE WILL HE, bnt irom the cross-examination of Dr. Williams to-day one might infer that they will attempt to show that the Jessamine and chioral giren by him, or one or the other, was the cause ol General Ketcnuin's death; and this theory is supported by the fact that many medical gentlemen trom Phila delphia and Baltimore of high position have been summoned by the defence. There is also a rumor, that has gained much credit, that they will" under take to snow that General Kctchum waft in the liauit of carrying and taking poisonous drugs, and this theory is supported by the tact that a considerable nuraoer of arm.v officers that knew General Ketcbum have been summoned. There arc also many otner rumor* afloat In rcia tloa to the case ami Its conduct,that it might no) do to repeat until a later date. (Sunday's letter of this correspondence will contain a review of the week s proceedings and facts in relation to this mysterious case of a highly interesting character. No trial within the history of criminal prosecution* in this country has ever been heard which developed such interesting and Important surroundings as belong to this. A lew days more of investigation will dear up the terrible and mysterious circum stances that cluster around this unfortunate lady, or deepen their import into positive proof.

Last night was the final performance of tne first regular irwon of the NUhjou Italian Opera Com pany, which season lasted tweuty nights, and brought in gross receipts abont $100,000. The oc casion was the means ot bringing together the tiaoai brilliant assemblage that patronizes opera in this cttv, and Nilsson was in the best of voice for what we consider one or her very beet roles, the on happy Bribe of Lammermoor. Passing over the other parts of this marvellous impersonation, of which we have already given an elaborate criticism, we can point to the mad scene aa one ot the most magnificent creations or genius presented on the operatic stage at the present time. It la a enbitme effort on the part or the artist and one that wilt never fade from the memory ot those present. Briguoit was tne Bdgardo, having been granted tbe honor or opening and closing the sea son with Mlsson, He won deserved applause in the two fine teuor arias that close the opera, Barre was a verv tame ash ton. and nullified tbe import ance or the role. A matinee will be given to-day, In wnich Mile. Duval will essay tbe rote of Zerlina lu "Fra Dlavolo," and In the even ing Mlsson appears at the Brooklyn Academy in "Lucia." The extra season, Philadelphia being abandoned, either on aocount of the prevalence or the smallpox or on account of the success which has attended the New York season, commences on Monday with "Mignon." On Wed nesday "11 Trovatore" will be presented, with Mile. Nlisson as Leonora, Miss Cary as Aaucena. Blgnor brignoh as Manrtco and li. Barrfe as Count di Luna. The announcement made ot Miss Keiiogg's engage ment with the troupe appears to be premature, m that artist will not sing until the season of opera to he given during the Easter holidays under the man agement of Carl Rosa, during which season Miss Kellogg, Mme. Parepa-Rosa, Mrs. Jenny Van Zandt, Mauame Gazzanlga (probably), Wachtel and casiel inary will appear In Italian opera. Personal Intelligence. State comptroller Ashcr P.
