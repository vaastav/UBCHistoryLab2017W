All communications Intended for publication must be accompanied by the real name of the writer, though not foi publication unless desired, otherwise they wi.‘ receive no attention. .4 TKASSPAR AWT SNA lit:. The Philadelphia Press, an incorrig ible jingo, tries to tempt President Cleveland iu very seductive phrases to win its commendation by being what it calls more "‘American.” Af ter insulting him by falsely saying that “he has unfortunately been so untrue to American traditions and principles and policy that the people could not support him without them selves being false to national instincts and interests,” itgoeson to say : “If, however, Mr. Cleveland has learned the lesson and shall now take a new and patriotic course, none will recog nize it more freely or welcome it more cordially than those who have hereto fore been constrained to criticise him most severely.” The people expect rabid talk from the Press , expect to find the President in its columns accused of the "‘prostra tion of our home industries and busi ness” and of “recreancy and humilia tion in surrendering our national tra ditions and compromising our Ameri can name in the forum of nations,” and the public, from experience, knows just how much stock to put in such statements. But even the wild est believer in the Press could hardly have expected such an exhibition of nerve on its part as it makes when it offers President Cleveland its commen dation as a reward for changing his dignified, honorable, genuinely Ameri can course. It is natural perhaps that the Press should think that a word of commen dation in its columns should he worth more than a good conscience, more than a sense of duty to the American people, more than a consciousness of having done right; but we very much doubt whether Mr. Cleveland will deem the promised pat-on-the-back of the Press as the highest earthly prize he can win. History will do President Cleveland jutice long after the attack of the Press and the other jingoes, whether due to their own narrowness, ignor ances or partisanship, have been for gotten. President Cleveland’s lofty, fair and dignified conduct of foreign affairs will be told to the credit of the nation, which, we regretfully admit, did not appreciate it at the time. We do not know what the President’s forthcoming message will contain, but we do know that the President is an American, not a jingo, and we are quite certain that, whatever he does, there will be no departure from the honorable policy heretofore followed by him, and especially no relapse in the hope of winning the high reward of jingo commendation.— York Ga zette. 

POLITICS VS. PATRIOTISM. None of the Republican leaders or papers who are now expressing opin ions as to the probable course of Con gress are authorized to speak for Con gress. Circumstances may so change during the session that Congress may act altogether differently from what is now prophesied. Still it is fair to judge the intentions of the Republican majority by the words of the individ ual members and party organs, and taking these as indications it looks very much as though patriotism would have little weight and politics be all-powerful. The central idea of nearly all that is said seems to be how the Republican majority can best embarrass Cleve land’s administration so as to discredit it, and with it the Democratic party, in the eyes of the people, in the hope of thus making political capital for the Presidential campaign. It is real ly disgracefal that the Republican | press should with such brutal frank ness disclose this narrow, unpatriotic policy of the Republican party. A stranger to our institution and history, especially late history, would imagine from reading the paper, that congress, which is about to meet, as sembles merely for the purpose of fighting the executive branch of the government and of influencing the election of the next President. Thai it assembles for the purpose of enact ing wise and patriotic legislation, re gardless of political considerations, the only real reason for its existence, is an idea relegated to the background and one which, in the eyes of the po liticians, seems to he held obsolete. Let us hope that these papers and limber-tongued statesmen are libell ing the Republican majority in con gress. No one will hesitate to believe that the Republican congressmen, one and all, are anxious to boom Re publican stock, but at the same time we decline, without further proof, to believe that they are selfish politi cians rather than genuine representa tives of the people. We do not believe that mere political considerations will govern all they do. ♦ ♦ - THE 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. President Cleveland sent Congress on Monday a very lengthy message, dealing with the important matters of the day. The first important ques- , tion Mr. Cleveland speaks of is the • attack on foreigners in Japan and China during the recent war. Al- ' though hut one American citizen was ' reported killed and the property of ■ American missionaries not as much in jured as those of other nationalities, 1 yet a prompt and decided action is ' urged with all foreign powers. The case of ex-Consul Waller is re- ] ferred to at length, and justice in the matter is promised Mr. Waller. Our relation with all the foreign powers is also discussed in an exhaus- i tive manner. The main point is the financial problem, and President Cleveland treats it in a wise and impassionate manner. He urges the issue of a low rate of government bonds, to take the place of bank notes which have been • redeemed. i ™ THE A pro 

ISTME X T OP DEMO- , CHATS BV REPUBLICANS. The Republicans elected in Balti- i more are adopting the course of ap- 1 pointing some Democrats to office in place of recognizing deserving Repnh- 1 licans, who have been in the thickest of the fight for years. This action is j being roundly condemned by many of ’ the office seekers, and threats of no ' pleasant nature are being made as 1 lie j penalty to be visited on the party iu case this policy is carried out. i Jiil. i(il iilLi/ D i . . t . i k. . EUR SECRETARY OE STATE. Governor-elect Lloyd Lowndes has tendered the Secretary of State to Mr. Richard Dallam. On Wednesday he accepted the position. Mr. Dallam is the son of the late Major William H. Dallam, who was Deputy Collector of the Port of Baltimore, under the late Col. Edwin H. Webster. Mr. Dallam is thirty-one years old and a promi nent member of the Harford county bar. He was a candidate on the Re publican ticket in 181)1, and also in 1895 for State’s Attorney, being defeat ed both times by Mr. Walter W. Pres ton, the present incumbent. Mr. Dal lam was educated at the Bel Air academy and graduated at the Mary land Law School iu 1888. He has many warm friends in the county, who will appreciate this fitting recog nition by the Governor elect of one of the best and most talented young men in the county. 

WHAT WILL CONGRESS VO? The Fifty-Fourth Congress, which has convened at Washington, has be fore it an ardious task in settling the monetary question. That our finances are in bad shape, goes without saying, and that some radical legislation is needed, is equally as certain. What we need now is for the wisest heads to get together.and regardless of politics, give a financial system which will pre vent panics like the past few years. We must have a change in our pres ent financial system. What is best is hard, indeed, to determine. Our gov ernment is youmr yet in the history of nations, and until some settled policy has been established whereby our money will he recognized all over the world as a legal tender, we will con tinue to have these flnancal disturb ances. —President Cleveland on Tuesday nominated Rufus W. Peckham as As sociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to succeed the late Judge Jackson. He is a brother of W. H. Peckham, who was nominated some time ago and rejected by the Senate. It is understood that Senator Hill will not oppose the appointment. —Hon. Thomas H. Robinson is be ing actively pushed by his friends as a candidate for Congress on the Demo cratic ticket. His nomination would undoubtedly wheel the Second Con gressional District hack where she belongs, in the Democratic column, fay a large majority. —Maryland will he well represented at Atlanta this week. The fourth and fifth regiments will be their en masse with all the pomp and pauolpy of war except the ffghting part and all the southerners will feel proud of the country south of Mason and Dixons line. —Mr. S. A. Williams whose name has been mentioned as a candidate for United States Senator declined the office of Secretary of State positively on Monday. It is said that he will have a strong hacking in the Legisla ture for Senator. We sincerely hope he will get it. ♦ --- —President Cleveland’s message is one of the ablest State documents is sued from the AVhite House in many years. All eyes are now turned towards the Presidential election in 1896. Land Transfer* in November. Otbo S. Lee, trustee, to James S. Slade. William M. Scarborough to Emma C. Scar borough. Emelia E.
