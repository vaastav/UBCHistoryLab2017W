I FAG* FOOB. THE EVENING TIMES Human life has been immensely widened in its superficial advantages, in what may be called our own day. Within (toe memory of living men half the twenty greatest discoveries and inventions of all time have been made. With the use of fire, the mechanical devices of the wedge and the lever, .the art of writing, printing by movable type the inventor of gun powder, the mariner's compass, the telescope, the circulation of the blood and the ex pansion of steam, may be compared the advances which have changed the face of common life in civilized lands more recently. One group of these includes the application of steam and electricity for power, heat and light, yielding a vast variety of fabrica and utensils for personal use and adorn ment ana for domestic comfort which the wealth of kingdoms could not pur chase 100 years ago. Modern medical science has contributed largely to hu man health and even to longevity. The discovery of anaesthetics and an tiseptic surgery hap reduced physical pain and lessened the danger and dread of surgical treatment. Educa tion and intelligence is more widely dif fused than ever before, largely by the invention of the cylindrical press. The social benefits of rapid and cheap' transportation are notable. Almost eveqr city and town suburbs are de veloping. Overcrowded tenements, breeding places of disease and vice are yielding to dwellings in more wholesome and open locations, still BENNER, BEG6 & GARVIN'S Gift Guide This list may contain a suggestion of just the gift you desire.

A PULPIT GEM. Occasionally there glints l'rom the pulpit of the country a gem of thought so optimistic, so comprehensive and so broad that it is well worth pre serving. It is too often the case that the opinions of the pulpit are turned to the darker, gloomier side of life and the brightness of the intellectual splendor with which we are daily sur rounded is lost in the shadows which lie on the .other side. In a recent sermon in the Union Park Congrega tional church at Boston, the pastor. Dr. Bassett, presented the beauties of the present .as compared with the life of half a century ago, in the fol lowing beautiful words: 

WEDNESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 6, INC. to be Imcnlcalcd. OD* within reach of wharves and factories. In the days when travel was oostly in money and time and was even per ilous, life was narrowed by isolation. Much contact between men. and wo men, nation and nation, was impossi ble. Now we go freely from place to place and from land to land. But it is a careless eye which sees only means of comfort and luxury in the material wealth which all modern men aro in some degree heir to, and it is a shallow soul which looks upon in all with only self-congratulation at living in this age of the world. CONGRESS AND CUBA. It is not at all improbable that con gress will in substance be requested to lftep hands off the Cuban situation and allow the executive branch of the national government to continue to administer the affairs there in accord ance with the plans already lain dowu by Governor ^lagoon. It is becoming evident at this time that congress, while acting in the very best of faith in granting Cuba its independence, was too willing to listen to the clamor of the public rather than to look calm, ly and dispassionately at thd* actual conditions in Cuba. From the day that the Americau army and navy annihilated the power of Spain in the western hemisphere the democratic party has been clamoring for freedom for the Cubans. That the party, and especially its southern wing composed of men like Senator Tillman, who have forcibly refused to all the negroes of the south to have even the semblance of freedom, should have been the last people in this country to demand elective free dom for a race which they certainly knew was at that time not qualified to exercise it, did not strike the public blatant political hypocrisy. This democrats of the south have constantly, and it must be ad mitted with some show of reason, contended that the poliUcal danger to the south came from giving the freed men the power of the ballot before they were educated to the value of its importance. Tet that section demand- 4 ed that the same conditions be al lowed in Cuba. There is no question that the Cu bans were given the right to govern themselves before they were qualified for the same. They had been unde the rule of Spain for centuries :and in that time had had no practice in the ad ministration of governmental affairs. ,the officials of Spain who had been sent to administer affairs on the is land were corrupt and openly robbed the people for their own private gain The people of Cuba had learned by generations of observation that the principal right of an office holder was that of plundering the people. No wonder then that so many of them were anxious to overthrow '.he regu larly elected government in order that the plunder pie might be distrib uted more generously! Congress realized the conditions which existed at the time the ciwptr^ was given its separate independence, but the clamorings of the democratic party for the granting of the same were so vigorous that the public was beginning to believe they were true, Yielding to this public clamor the na tional legislature granted what it knew the Cubans were not competent to handle and the results of that ill advised and hasty action are in evi dence at this time in the firm and vig orous "interference" which is being exercised by this government at Ha vana. It is probable, in view of these facts that the president will insist on con gress keeping hands off the Cuban sit uation and allowing the ex ecutive branch of the government to work out the completion of the scheme which it has formulated for the re-pacification of Cuba. It is admitted that the pres ident is absolutely fearless of public opnion. and some of his greatest moves on the public checker board have beeu in open defiance of the same. He will hardly allow the satne mistake to be made again in Cuba that wai made three years ago. The senior exponent of unadulter ated democracy should have no ser ious fears of The Evening Times but ting into the efforts of that sheet to keep the Judiciary ot the state free from politics by holding down the' position in the first district until a democratic governor is in position to distribute the plums. The Evening Times cares not one whit, so far as the politics are concerned, whether Judge Fisk refupes to go on the su preme bench until" the appointment of his successor can be made by Gov­ ernor Burke, or whether he accepts the place and contributes something toward the correction of the muddle into which the supreme court has been thrown by the narrow minded ness of Engerud. It The Evening Times were .playing a political game in the matter it would want .ludge Fisk to remain, where he is until the new governor Is Inaugurated, so that the act could be seen by the people as a conclusive evidence that all the talk in the late campaign In reference to a removal of the judiciary from poll tics by the election .of a democratic member was political bosh intended to deceive the public. But it would rather see the work of the supreme court properly attended to than to have the republican party have the advantage arising in a political way from the playing of politics in the se lection of the local jiidge by the dem ocratic party. Some months ago the city council passed a resolution requiring all tele phone and district light wires to be placed under ground in the business sections of the city, and the poles re moved from the streets. The compan ies were given one year in which to do the work, but they have made no preparation toward accomplishing the required end. This is merely a re minder of the resolution of the coun cil, and it is to be hoped that the companies will comply willingly with the demands of the city administra tion in its efforts to beautify the streets. The Evening Times hates to do it, but it is not possible that the cry of certain democrats who have a large number of friends to place in the Burke administration, that he should sot have candidates pressed upon him, is a means of keeping the other fel lows quiet while these parties land the plums? It is none of our business but it strikes the man who has seen some politics played as a shrewd game to head off opposition. In the death of W. B. Wood this city loses' a progressive citizen, a broad minded and upright man, a true and loyal supporter of everything that makes for the good of the com munity, and the state suffers the loss of a man who has been as devoted to her interests as the needle to the pole. There were few better men than W. B. Wood. Carpio has a well attended night school. Brinemade has organized a local W. C. T. U. Brinsmade w^nts a town well and wants it badly. The Glen Ullln post office has been raised from a fourth to a third class. The seat of J. E.

Arch Deacon Jones of Bismarck has been doing some spiritualistic work in the slope counties. Jamestown sportsmen secwad four teen deer near Wilton, and yet it is claimed thaat the boys down there are no good. The religious tone of the town of Brinsmade has improved since it goi a lot of cars so that the grain could be bandied. .The editor of the Granville Record 'has been hunting big game on the Missouri. He intimates that he hunt ed for other things" besides deer, too. Garrison had a- shooting scrape in which the victim' was a man who had been caught in a blizzard a few years ago and his feet so badly frozen that both were amputated. The town of Fried of Stuttsman county has been platted, the plat cov ering an area of ten acres with the lots one acre in size. A parochial school is expectetd to be built on one of the lots near the church. County Superintedent James Dun phy of Rolette County has instituted an action in district court to contest the election of E. M. Sherry to the of fice of county superintendent' of schools on the ground of lack of qualification. The residence of Mr. and Mrs. Jas. Burgess at Velva was entered for the third time, almost within a year, Sun-' day night while the family was at Church.
