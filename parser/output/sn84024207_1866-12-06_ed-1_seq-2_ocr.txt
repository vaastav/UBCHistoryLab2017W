MESSAGE OPTHB President of Ihe United Slates, .'. TO TBS TWO SOUSES OF CONGRESS, AT THE CiMMMmitat af tha ItwiiltnUi fttfott Citizens of the Senate and House tf Representatives: After a brief interval tho Congress of the United states resumes lis annual legislative labors. An all wise and merciful Providence has abated the pestilonco which visited our shores, leaving its calamitous traces upon some portions of our country. Peace, or der, tranquility, and civil aathoritv have been formally declared ft) exiBl throughout the whole of the United blutes In all of the Slates civil au thority has superceded the coercion of arms, and (he people, by their volun tary action, are main taming their Gov eroments in full astivity and complote oporation. 'ihe enforcement of the laws is no longer "obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by tho ordinary course of judicial proceedings," and tho ani mosities engendered by tho war are rapidly yielding to the beneficent in fluences of our free institutions, and to the kindly effects of unrestricted social and commercial intercourse. An en tire restoration of rutornal feeling must bo the earnest wish ot every pa triotic heart; and we will huvo accom plished our grandest nutional achieve ment when, forgolling thn sad ovents of tho past, and remembering only their instructive lessons, we resume our onward career as a free, prosper ous and united people. In my message of the 4th of Decem ber, 18G5, Congress was Informed of tho measures which had been instituted by the Executive with a view to the general restoration of the States in which the insurrection occurred to their relations with the General Gov ernment. Provisional Governors had been appointed, Conventions called, Governors elected, Legislatures assem bled, nnd senators and Keprcsonta fives chosen to tho Congress of tbo U States. Courts had been Qponod for mo eniorcomcni or laws long in obey amo. Tho blockadq bad boon romov cd, custom houses re established, nnd the internal revenuo laws put in force, iii uiuer xnuiiuo people might con tribute to the notional income. Postal operations had been ronewod, and ef forts were beine mudo to rostoro them lo their former condition of efficiency. Tho States thomsolvcs had boen asked to tako part in the high function of amending the Constitution, and of thus sanctioning tho extinction of African slavery usotio of the legitimate results of our intornocino struggle. Having progressed thus fur, the Ex ccutivo Department found that it hud accomplished nearly all that was with in the scope of its constitutional au thority. One thing, however, vet ro- mainod to bo done buforo tho work of restoration could bo completed, and that was tho admission to Conirress of loyal Senators and Representative from Ihe States whose people had re- oeueu against mo mwiui authority ot the General Government. This ques tion devolved upon tho rospcctivo Houses, which, by the Constitution, are made the judges of tho elections, re turns and qualifications of their own moinbors, and its consideration at once engaged the attention of Congress. In tho moantimo, the Executive Do parlmont no other plun having been proposed by Congress continued its efforts to perfect, as far as was practi cable, the restoration of tho proper re lations between tho citizens of tho re spectivo States nnd tho General Gov ernment, extending, from time to tiino, as tho public interest seemed to require, the judicial, rovenuo und postal sys tems of tho oountry. With the advito and consent of tho Senate, tho noccs sary officors wore appointed, andvap propriutions mado by Congress for the payment of their kiilnries. The pro position to nmondtho Federal Consti tution so as to prove nt tho existence of slavery within tho Uuitod Status or any pfuoo subject to thoir jurisdiction, was rutifiod by the rcquisito number of Sulci; and on the 18th day of De cember, 18G5, it was officially declared to have bocome vulid us a purt of the Constitution of the United Slatos., All of the States in which the insurrection had existed promptly amended thoir Constitutions, so us to make them con form to the grout change thus effected in the organ io Uw of the lund; declar ed null and void all ordinances and laws of secession; repudiated all pro tendod debts and obligations created tor tho revolutionary purposos of the insurrection; and proceeded, in good faith, to the enuotmonloi measures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of tho colored raeo. Cou gress, however, yot hesilatod to adult any of theso Stales to representation; und it was not until toward tho close of tbo eighth month of the session that an exception wasmude in favor of Ten- nessoe, by the admission of ber Sena tors and Representatives. I deem it a subject of profound re- grot thut Cougross hus thus far failed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Representatives from tho other Slates, whoso inhabitants, with those of Ten ncssuo, hud ongugod iu the rebellion. Ten States moro than one-fourth of the whole numberremain without ropreeoi .ation; the seats of fifty mem bers in the Uouse of licprcsi utatives, and of twenty members in tho Senate, are yot vacant not by their own con soul, not by a failure of election, but by the refusal of Congress to aocopt their credentials. Thoir admission, it is believed, would have accomplished much towards Ihe renewal anu strength ening of our relations as one neonlo. and remove sorious ouuso for discon tent on Ihe part of the inhabitants of those tales. it would have aooorded with tho great principle enunciated In the.Declarulion of American Independ ence, that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation, and yst be denied the right ot representation. It would bavs been tn consonance with the ex press provisions of the Constitution, thai "each (Slate shall at least have one Representative" and "that no Siate, without IU consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."- These provisions wore intended to se cure to every State, aod to tbepeople ot every Slate, the right ot representa tion in each Uouse of Congress; and so important was it deemed by the train ers of the Constitution that the equali ty of the States in tho Senate should be presorved, that not even by an amend ment of the Constitution can any State, without its consent, be denied a voico in tbat brunch of the National Legislature. ft is true, it bos been assumed that tbe existenco of the States was termi nated by the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and that the insurrection having been suppressed, they were thenceforward to be considered merely as conquered territories. The legisla tive, executive and judicial depart ments of tbe Government have, how ever, wilh great distinctness and uni form consistency, refused to sanction an assumption so incompatible with tho nature of our republican system, and with the professed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legisla tion of Congress, the undeniable fact makes itself apparent, that these ton political communities are nothing less than States of this Union. At the very commencement ot the rebellion, esch Uouse declared, wilh a unanimity as remarkable as it was significant, that tho war was not "Waged, upon our part, in any spirit of oppression, nor lor any purpoae of conquest Or subju gation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights, or estab lished institutions of those states, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of tbe Constitution nnd all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the Union wilh all the dignity, equal ity, and rights of the several States on impaired; and that as soon as theso ob jects" were "accomplished tbe war ought to ccuso. In some instances Sonators were permittod to coi'muo thoir legislative functions, while in other instances, Representatives were elected and admitted toseats after their Slatos had formally doclarod thoir V.ght. to withdraw from tho Union, and were endeavoring to maintain that right by fqreo of arms. All of the States whose pcoplo were in insurrec tion, as States, wero inoluded in tbe apportionment ot tho direct tax of twenty millions of dollars annually laid upon tho United Stutcs by thoaot approvod 0th August, 1801, Congress, by tho act of Murch 4, 18G2, and by Ihe apportionment o( representation thereunder, also reoopnlaed thoir pros enoe as States in the Union; and they have, for judicial purposes, been di vided into districts, us States alone can be divided. Tho samo recognition op poars In tbo rrcont legislation in ref oronco to Tennessee, which evidontly rests upon tho fact thut the functions of the Statu woro not destroyod by tho rebellion, but merely suspended; and tho prinoiplo is of course applicable to thosq Slates which, like Teuncsspe, at tempted to renounce their places i tbo Union, Tbo action of tho Executive Depart ment of the Government upon this sub ject has beon equally deflnito and uni form, and tho purposo of tho war was specifically staUd in tbe Proclamation of my predoecssor on the 22d day of September, 18C2. It was then solemn ly proclaimed and declarod that "hero aftsr, as heretofore, the war will bo prosecuted for the object of practically rostoring tho constitutional relation between tho United States and each of the btates and tho people thereof, in which States that relation is or may bo suspended or disturbed." Tbo recognition of tho Stutos by tbo Judicial Department of tho Govern ment has also beon clear and conclu sive in all proceedings affecting them as Slates, had in tho Supremo, Circuit, and Judicial" Courts. In the admission of Senators and Representatives from any and ull of the Stales, there can bo no just ground of nnprehonsion that persons who are disloyal will bo clothed with Ihe pow ers ol legislation, lor this could not happen when tho Constitution and the laws are enlorcod by a vigilant and faithful Cone ross. Each House is mado the "judge of tho elections, roturus, and quantisations of itsown members," and may, "with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member." WhonnSnn. utor or Representative presents bis eeruucaie or election, he may atonco be admit tod or rejected; or, should there bo any question as to bis eligibility, his credentials may be roforrod for in vestigation to tho appropriate commit- (co. u aumtitea to a seat, it must bo unon evidence satisfactory to thn FTnna of which ho th us becomes a member. that he possessed tbo requisite consti tutional and legal qualifications. If rofusod admission as a member for! want of duo allegiance to the Oovorn-! moot, and returned to his constituents. I they are admonished that nono but i ersons loyal to the United States will; o allowed a voice in the loirislativo councils of the nation, and tho political. power ana moral influence of Conirress aro thus effectively exortod in the in- i tercst oi loyalty to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon this quos.ion, so vitally affecting the ros toralion of the Union and the perma noncy of our presont form of govern ment, mv OOnvistions. horfttnfnrA a. Crossed, have undergone no change;' ut, on the contrary, thoir correctness has beon oonurmod by reflection and. lime. If tbe admission of loyal mem-1 bora to soats in the rospeotive Houses I ot Congress was wise and eipodiont a; year ago, it is no less wise und expedU! ent now. If this anomalous condition ' is right now if, in the exaot condition of theso Stales at the presoot time, it is lawful to exclude thorn from ropre-; sentution, I do not soe that the ques tion will bo changed by the efflux of time. Ten years honoe, if these States romain as they are, the r'ght of renre seotation will bo no stronger tbe right of exclusion will be no weaker. I The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of tho Presi dent to recommend to the considera tion of Congress "such measures as he shall judge necessary or expedient" I know of no measure more imperative ly demanded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy and equal justice, than the admission of loyal member! from tbe now unrepre sented States. This would consam-1 male the work of restoration, and ex erta most Salutary influence in tho re- establishment ot peace, harmony, and fraternal reeling, It would tend great ly to renew tho confidence of tbe Amer ican people In tbe vigor and stability oi tneir insmuiions fl would biad us moro closely to gether as a natron, and enable us to show to the world tbe inherent and re cuperative power of a Government founded upon the will cf the people, and established upon the principles of liberty, justice and intelligence. Uur increased strength and enhanced pros perity would irrefragibly demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of republican government, ihe admis sion of loyal members from tbe States excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt anil apprebebsion, would turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity for investment, into the channels of trade and industry. It Would alleviate tho present troubled condition of those States, nnd, by induciug emigration, aid in the settlement of fertile regions now uncultivated, and lead to an in creased production of those staples which have added so greatly to the wealth of tbo nation and the commerce of the world, ew fields of enterprise" would be opened to our progressive people, and soon tbe devastations of war would be ropaired, acd all traces of our domestic differences effaced from the minds of our countrymen, In our offorts to preserve "the urwt. of Government which constitutes us ontpoople." by restoring V Stutoa tn the condition Wlilcr. they hold prior w uiu rcueiiiuu, wo should be cautious lest, having rescued oar nation from perils of Jhreatonod disintegration, we resort to consolidation, and in tho end absolute despotism, as a remedy for the recurrence of similar troubles. The war having terminated, and with it all occasion for tho exorcise of dow era of doubtful constitutionality, we should hu9ten to bring legislation with in the boundaries prescribed by tho constitution, and to return to tbe an oient landmarks established by our fa thors for tho guidanoo of succeeding generations. ' The Constitution which at any timo exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of tho whole poople, is suoredly obligatory upon all." "If, in the opinion of the people, tno distribution or modiaoution ot the constitutional powers bo, in any particular, wronir. lot it bo corrected by an amendment In tho way in which tho Constitution designates. But lot thoro be no. elutngo by usurpation; for" "it is the customary weapon by which free governments are des troyod." Washington spoke those words to his countrymon, whon, fol lowed by thoir love und irrutitudo. ho volunturily retired from the euros of puouo life. "Xo Keep in all things within the palo of our constitutional powors, and cherish tbo Federal Un ion as the only rock of safely,' wero prescribed by Jefferson as rules of ac tion toendeur to his 'countrymen the trite principles of their constitution, and promoto a union ot aentimont and action equally auspialous to iheir hap piness and safety." Jackson hold that the action of tho General Government should always be strictly oonfinod to tbo sphere of its appropriate duties, and justly and forcibly urged that our Government is teot to- be maintained nor our Union preserved "by invasions of the rights and powors of tho Boveral States. In thus aitumptinr to make our General Governmont strong, wo raaKo it work. Its true strength con sists in leaving individuals und States as niiiob as possible to thcmsolvoe; in making itself A) It, not in its power, but in its bonofioenco; not in its con trol, but in its protection; not in bind ing States more closely to tho oontor, but leaving oaou to movo unobstruct ed in its proper constitutional orbit." These are Ihe teachings of men whoso deods and sorvices bavo mudo them illustrious, and who, long sinoo with drawn from the scones of lifo, havo loll to their country . the rich legacy of their example, thoir wisdom, and thoir patriotism. Drawing iroslt in spiration from their lossona, let us emuluto them iu lovo of country and respect for tbo Constitution unci tho laws. The report of the Secretary ol tbe Troasury affords much information respecting the revenuo and commorco of tho oountry. His views upou tbo currency, and wilh reference to . a proper adjustment of our rovonuo systom, intornul as well as impost, aro commended to the careful considera tion of Congress. In my last annual message I expressed my general views upon theso subjects. I noed now only call attention to tho nooessity of cur rying into every department of tho Government a systom ol rigid account ability, thorough retrenchment, and wise economy. 'With no exoeplionai nor unusual expenditures, the oppres sive burdens ot taxulion can be lessen ed by suoh a modification of our rovo nuo laws as will bo consistent with tho publio faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants of the Govern ment. . The report presents a much moro satisfactory condition of our finunoes than one year ago tbe most Bangui ne could have anticipated. During the fiscal year ending lne0ih June, 1865, the last year ot tbe war, tbo public debt was inoroased 1941,902,537, and on the 31st of October, 18(j5, it amount ed to 12,710,854,750. On tbe 31st day ol October, 18titf, it bad been reduoed to 12,551,310.006, tbe diminution, dur ing a poriad of fourteen months, com mencing September 1, 1865, and end ing October 31, 1866, having beon 1206,379,565. In ihe last annual re port on the stale of the finances, it was estimated that during the three quarters ot the fiscal year ending the 30th of June last, the debt would be increased f 112,194,947. During that feriod, however, it was reduced S31, 96,387, the receipts of the year hav ing been $89,905,905 more, and the ex pendituies $200,629,235 less than the estimates. Nothing could more clear ly indicate than these statements tbe extent and availability of the national resources, aod the rapidity and safety with whioh, under our form of govern ment, great military and naval estab lishments can be disbanded, aod ex war to a peace tooting, curing monacal ysar. ending the penses reduced from i roueipis were or 3,4iu,i8-i. The length ot railroad $558,032,620, and tbe expenditures routes is thirty two thousand and rime $520,750,940, leaving an available sor- ty-two miles, and the annual tiansDdr. plus of $37,281,680. It is 'estimated tbat the receipts for the fiscal year end ing the 30th of June, 1867, will bo $475,061,886, and that the expondi. tores will reach the sura of $316,428,. 078, leaving in tho treasury a surplus of $158,633,308. For tho fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $436, 000,000, and that tho expenditures will be $350,247,641 showing an exoess of $85,752,359 in favor of vho Govern ment. These estimated receipts may be diminished by a reduction ot excise and import duties; but after all nec essary reductions shall have been made, tne revenue ot the present and of fol lowing yosrs will doubtless be BUfftcient to cover all legitimate chargos upon tbe Troasury, and leave & large annual surplus to bo applied to the payment of the principal of the debt. There seems now to be no good reason Why taxes may not be reduoed as the coun try advances in population and wealth, and yet tbe debt be extin guished within the nest quarter of a coniury. . , - Tbe report of thb Secretary of War furnishes, valuable and important in formation in reference to the opera tions of bis Department during the past year. 'Few volunteers now re main in the sorvico, and they aro, be ing discharged as rapidly as they can bo replaced by regular -troops. The army has beon promptly paid, careful ly provided wilh medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted, and is to be famished with breech-loading small arrns. Tbo military strength ot tho nation bus boon unimpaired by tho discharge ot voluntoers, tbe disposition of unserviceable or perishable stores, and the retrenchment of expenditure. Sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been rotuinod, and, from the disbanded volunteers stand ing ready to respond to tho national oarll, largo armies can bo rapidly or ganised, equipped and concentrated. Fortifications on tho ooast and frontier havo received, or are boing prepared for moro powerful armaments; lako sur-. voys and harbor and river improve ments are in courso of cnoriretio pros ecution. Preparations have been uiade lor tao pay moot ot the additional boun ties authorised during the recent ses sion of Congress, under such regula tions as will protect tho Government from fraud, and secure to tbo honora bly discharged soldier tho woll-earnod reward of his faithfulness, und gallant ry More than six thousand maimed soldiers havo received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus; und forty one national oemolerios, containing tho remains of 101,536 Union soldiers have already been established. Tho total estimate of military appropriations is $25,205,609'. It is stated in the report of the Sec retary of the Navy that the naval force Biinigjtirao eousisis oi two nunareu and seventy-oight vessels, armed with Iwo thousand threo hundred and fifty-one guns. Of these, ono hundred aod fifteen vessels, carrying ono thous and and twenty nino guns, are in commission, distributed chiefly among seven squadrons. The number of men in the service is thirteen thousand six hundred. Great activity and vigilance havo been displayed by all tho squad rons, and their movements have boen judiciously and efficiently arranged in eiir.ha manner as would best promote American commorco, und proteot tho rights and intoiostsof our countrymen abroad. 1 ho vessels unemployed are undergoing repairs, or are laid up ua.; til thoir sorvicos may bo required. Most of the iron-clud fleet is at Leaguo Island, in tho vicinity of Philadelphia, a piano which until docisive action should bo taken by Congress, was st looted by tho Secretary of the Navy as the most eligible location for that class of vossols. It is important that a suit able publio station should bo provided for tho iron clad fleet. It is intended that theso vessels shall bo in proper condition for any emergency, and t is desirable that tho bill accepting' League Island for naval purposes, which passed tho House of Represent atives at its lust session, shoubi receivo final action nt an oarly period, in or der that there may bo a suitable pub lio station for this olass of vossols, as well as a navy-yard of area surlloiont for tho wants ot tho service on the Del aware River. The uaval pension fund amounts to $11,750,000, having boon inoroased $2,750,000 during tho year, Tho expeuditures of the Department for the fiscal year ending 30th June last wore $13,321,526, and the esti mates for tho coining yoar amount to $23,568,436. Attention is invitod to the condition of our seamen, and the importance of legislative moasures for their relief and improvement. The suggestions in bohalf of this deserving class of our fellow-cilixons are earnest ly recommended to tho favoruble at tention of Congress. The report of the Post Master Gen eral presents a most satisfactory con dition of the postal service, and sub mils recommendations which deserve the consideration of Congress. The rovonuos of the Department for the year ending June 30, 1866, wore $14, 386,986, and the expenditures $15,352.- 079. showing an excess in the latter of VUbO,093. In anticipation of this do- floienoy, however, a special appropria tion was made by Congress in the act approved July 28, 1866. Inoludln, the Btanding appropriation of $700,00' for free mail muttor, as a legitimate portion of tbe revenues yet remaining unexpondod, the aotual deficiency for tho past year is only $265,093 a sum within $01,141 of tbe amount estimated in the annual report of 1864. The de crease of revenue compared with the previous year was one ana one-nilh per cent., and the increase of expendi tures, owing pri noipally to the en large moot of the mail sorvioo in the South, was twelve per cent. Ob the 30th ol June last there were in operation six thousand nine hundred and thirty mail routes, with an aggregate length of one hundred and oighty thousand nine hundred and twenty-one miles, an ag gregate annual transportation of seventy-one million eight hundred, and thirty-seven thousand nine bUhdred and fourtoen miles, and an aggregate , 'annual cost, including all expenditures tation thirty million six hundred and bine thousand four hundred and sixty. seven miles The length of steamboat routes Is fourteon thousand three httn dred and forty-six miles, and the annu al transportation three million four hundred and eletfnn thrtnUnn nina hundred and sixty-two miles. The mail service is rapidly increasing throughout the whole countrv. and lt steady extension in the Southern States indicates their steadily improving con dition. The trrOwintr imnmnnra f the foreign service also merits atton. tion. Tho Pobl Office DttHmnf r Great Britain and our Own have agreed upon a preliminary basis lor anew Postal Convention, which it is believed Will prove eminently bfinnfinUl hi commercial interests ot the Uniiod States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reuuuuon or me international letter postage to ono half the existing rates; a reduction of postage with all other oountrios to and from which correspon- wuv io iuuouiii,i,uu i tuo joruisn mail, or in closed mails through the United Kingdom: the estoblishment of uniform and reasonable chartros for the sea and territorial transit of corres pondenco in closed mails; and an al lowanco to each Post office Department of the right to use all mail coram un lea. lions established under the authority of tho other for the dispatoh of corres pondance, either In open or olosod mails, on the same terms as those ap plicable to the Inhabitants of the coun try providing Uu raoana of traasniis sion. The report of tbe Socretary oi the Interior exhibits the condition of those branches of tbe publio service whfeh ore committed to his supervision. Du ring the last fisoal year, 4,629,312 acres of publio land were disposed of. 1,892, 51S aores of which wero entered under the Ilom8tead Act The policy orig inally adopted relative to the public lands has undergono essential modifi cations. Immediate revenuo and not tbeir rapid settlement, was tho cardin al feature of our land system. Long experience and earnest discussion have resulted in the conviction that the ear ly development of our ngrieolturul re sources, and the "diffusion of an e.ner golio population over our vast torrito ry, are bjocts of fur greater import ance to tho national rowth and pros perity than the proceeds of tbe sale of tne land to the highest bidder in open market. Tbe pro emption laws confer upon tho pionedf who oomnliea with the terras they impose, the privilege of (juruuuaiug a ii.nj.ueo poriion oi "unoi- lorou tunas at tne minimum price. The homestead enactments relievo the settler from the paymont of purchase money and secure for him a permanent home, upon the condition of residence (or a'crm of years.

Congress baa made liberal grants of publio land to corporations, in aid of the construction of railroads and other iDtornal im.)rovotnent8. Should this poliey hercitter prevail more strin gent provisions will be required to se cure a faithful application of the fund The title to the landn should not pass by pattyit,or otherwise, but remain in the Government and subject to itsoon trol until some portion of tho road has beon actually built. Portions of them might then, from time to time, bo conveyed to the corporation, but never in a greater ra-tio to the whole quanti ty cmbraoed by tho grunt than the completed parts. boar to the entire length of the projected improvement This restriction would not operate to tbe prejudice of any undertaking con ceived in good failh and exoouted with reasonable onergy, as it is tho settled praotioe to. withdraw from the market the lands falling wilhin tho operation of such grants, and thus oxolude the inception of a subsequent adverse ritrht. A breaoh of tho conditions which Con gress may deem proper to impose should work a forfeiture of claim to the lands so wit hdrawn but uneonvey- ed, and ot ti'le to tho lands conveyed wnicn remain unsold. Operations on the several lines of the Puoilio Railroad have boen prose cuted with unoxampled vigor and suo cesa Should no unforeseen causes of delay occur, it is confidently anticipa ted that this great thoroughfare will be completed before the expiration of tho poriod designated by Congress. During the fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners, including' the ex penses of disbursement, was thirteen million tour hundred and fifty-nine thousand nino handled and ninety-six I dollars; and fifty thousand one hundred I and soventy-seven names wero added to the pension rolls. Tho entire num-1 ber of pensioners, Juno 30, 1866, was one hundred and twenty-six thousand , seven hundred and twenty-two. This fact furnishes molanoholy and striking' proof of the saorifioes made to vindi cate the constitutional authority ot the Federal Government; and to maintain inviolate the integrity of tbe Union. They imposo upon us corresponding obligations. It is estimated that thirty-three million dollars will be requir ed to meet the exigencies of this branoh ! of the service during the aext fisoal . year. : .1 Treaties have been concluded with the Indians who," ontioed into armed ; opposition to our Government at the; outbreak of tbe rebellion have incon ditionally submitted to our authority, i anrt man ifnat art an Aj.aaal H aui l-A l!ru a i renewal of friendly relations.

As a subjeot upon wbioh depends an immense amount of the produotion and commerce of the oountry, I rec ommend to Congress suoh legislation as may be necessary for the preserva tion of the levees of the Mississippi ( River.

The District of Columbia, nndnr nr. Istihg laws is not entitled to tbat rep resentation in the national councils whiob, from our earliest history, has been uniformly accorded to each Ter ritory established from time to time within our limits. It maintains pecu liar relations to Congress, to whom the' Constitution has granted the power of exercising exclusive legislation 'pier the seat of government." Our fellow citizens residing in the District, whoso interests are thus confided to the spec ial guardianship of Congress, exceed! in number the population of several of our territories, and no just reason is perceived why a delegate of thoir choice should not be admitted to av seat in the Houso of Representatives. No mode seems so appropriate and ef- icctaai ot enabling them to make known thoir peculiar condition andl wants, and of securing the local leo-in.. ' " lation adapted to thorn.

It la a question wcrthy of yoilt coJiaideration, whether our lawa up. on this subject are adequate to the prevention or puniahmenlof crime thus meditaled. In the month of April, bmt, as Congress Is aware,, a friendly arrangement was made between the Em peror or France and the President of the United States for the withdrawal from Mexiso of tbe French, expeditionary military forcea. 1hia withdrawal was to be effected in three detachments, thetirst o( which, It was understood, would leave Mexico in No, vember, now past, VI le aecond iu March next, and the ihjrd and taat in November, 18A7. Immediatel upon the oompletion of Ihe evacuation, the Fronch, Government was to assume the same attitude of non-intervention, in regard to Mexico, siheldby the Government of the United States. Repeated: assorano a have been given by the Emperor, ainces that agreement, that he would complete the prom, iaed evacuation within the period mentioned, or sooner. ... It was reasonably expected that the proceedings, thus contemplated would produce a crisis of great poliik-al interest in the ltcpulilio of Mexico. Tha newly appointed Minister to Mexico, Mr. Campbell was therefore sent forward, on the 0th of November, Inst, to assuioe hia prove faaetiogs aa Mial'tar Plenipotentiary of the United States to that Repub-. lie. It was also thought expedient thut he should: be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by the Lieu, tenant General of the Army of Ihe United States,, with the view of obtaining such information as might be important todetermine the eouxse to be pursues! by the United Stales in re-establishing and main taining necessary and j roper intercourse with tha Repulilia of Mexico. Deeply interested in the cause. of liberty and. humanity, it seemed an obvioua duty on our part to exercise whatever inSuenoe wenoa-. e.ned for llio restoration and permanent establish ment in that country of a domesti and republican, form of government. Such was the condition of affairs in regard tn. ' Mexico, when, on the 22d of November In9t, ofrlciali information was received from Paris that the Em peror of France bad aome tinie before deoided nol to withdraw a detuchment of hia force- in the month of NoTctuber past, aconrdinu) to engagement, but. that this decision was made wilh Ihe purpose of withdrawing tle whole of those forces in the ensuing spring. 01 this determination, however, the United Htateti had not ro eived any notice or intimation b . andassoonaa the Information was received by the. Government, care was taken to mute known ill dis-. sent to-the Emperor of France. - - ' I cannot forgo the hope that France will re-eon. aider the subject, and adopt aome resolutions in re gard to the evacuation of Mexico which will conform as nearly aa practicable with the existing engage-, ment, and thus meet the expectations ol the United States.
