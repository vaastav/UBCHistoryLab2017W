WAsiNO-rIN, December U.-The flowing is the President's Message road to-day in Congress: To the &nate and 17ouse of Representatives. GEORGIA To DE ItECONSTRUCTED. Seven of the States which passed the ordinances of suc.sion have been fully restoted to their places in the Union. 'Tihe eighth-Georgia-held an election at which she ratified her Constitution, republican in Sirm elect. ed a Governor, members of CongresP, State Legislature, and the other ffi cers required. The Governor was in stalled ; the Legislature met and per. formed all the acts then required of them by the reconstruction acts of Congress. Subsequently, however, in violation of the Constitution which they Lad just ratified, as since decid ed by the Supreme Court of that State, they unseated the colored mem bers of the Legislature and admitted to their seats some members who were disqualified by the third clause of the fourteenth amendment; an article, which they themselves had contribut ed to ratify. Under these circum stances, I would submit to you wheth er it would not be wise without delay to enact a law authorizing the Gover nor of Georgia to conve'ne the mmni be origically elected to the Legis lgture, requring each to take oath prescribed by the reconstruction acts, and none to be admitted who are it:eli. gible under the third clause of the fourteenth amendment. TiEa 

FREEDMEN. The freedmen under the protection which they have received, are making rapid progress in learning, and no ooaplaints arc heard of lack of indus try on their part when they receive fair remuneration for their labor. TILE GoVERMENT INcOME. The means provided for paying the interest on the public debt, with all other expenses of Government, are more than ample. TIlE LOSS OF OURI COMMERCE. The loss of our commerce is the only result of the late rebellion which has not received sufficient attention from you. To this subject I call your earnest atentioL. I will not now sug gest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if necessary, make it the subj et of a special mer sage during the aession. TIE ELECTIONs TINDEI 'IE RECON TION ACT IN UHE SOUTH. Congress, by joint resolution, au thorized the Executive to order elec tions in the States of Virginia, Mis sissippi, and Texas, to submit to then the Constitutions which each had previously framed, and to submit the Constitutions either entire or in sepe rate paits to be voted upon at the dis cretion of the Executive. Under this authority eleetions were ealled. In Virginia the election took place on the 6th of July. The Governor and Lieutenant-Gjvernor were elected and have been installed. The Legislature met and did all required by this reso lution and by all the reconstruction acts of Congresa, and abstained from all doubtful authority. I reconimend: tbat her senators and represeuntatives e prmptl admiitted to their seatls dthat the State be fully etoe to its place in the family of States. Elect ions wore' called in Mississippi and Texas, to. commence November 30th-two days in Mississippi and four in Texas. The elections have taken place, but 'tbe result it not known. It Ia hoped thatlth o ats of the Legislatures of those States, when they meet, will be such as to receive your* approval, and thus close the work of recolisbugon, THlE IlENUMPTIoN o? 5PEofE~ tAYMIENT. Among the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to, Is qI'hat of an irred emable eurrenoy. It is ab evil which I hope will receive your Engst Oairgest attention. It is a dutty, and one of .the highest duties of Government, to Securo to the citizen a medium of f~ed and iitvarylng value.

Ilfluetuations, hoidoer, ia the paper valune of the -measurp of all values-gold, is detriaudatal ' to the interests of- trade. It iakes 4hae a of business at v'woluutary e&ui'hlr, for in a0.1 oads Whieoe'f re, pqt is to be made, botit the partlia speog. late n's to what will be the value of the curroncy paid and received. I earnestly recommend to you, then, such legislation as will insure a gradu al return to specie payments, and put an immediate stop to the fluctuations in the value of currency. The meth. ods to secure the former of these re sults are as numerous as speculators on political economy. To secure the latter, I see but one way ; and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed value when. ever presented, and withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold. The vast resources of the nation, both develop ed and undeveloped, ought to make our credit the best on earth. With less burden of taxation than the citi zen has endured for the six years past, the entire public debt could be paid in ten years, but it is not desirable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time. Year by year the ability to pay increases in rapid ratio, but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be without a violation of contract. The public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from one to for ty-five years to run, bearing interest at the rate of five and six per cent. respectively. It is optional with the 'Government to pay these bonds at any period of the least time mentioned upon their face. The time has alrea. dy expired when a great part may be taken in, and rapidly approaching when it may well believed that all which are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding four and a half per cent., as as rapidly as the remainder become due they may be replaced in the same way. To accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize the in. terest to be paid at either of the three or four money-centres of Europe, or by any of the asaistant treasurers of the United States, at the option of the holder of the bond. I suggest this subject for the consideration of Con gress, and also simultaneously with this the propriety of redeeming our currency, as before suggested, at its market value at the time the law goes into effect, inereasing the rate at which currney will be bought and sold from iy to dJay of' week to weoit, et thie same rate of interest as the Govern ment pays upon its bonds. The subject of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention. The revenues of the coun try are gicater than the requirements, and may, with safety, be reduced ; but as the funding of the debt in a four or four and a half per cent. loan would reduce the annual current ex penses largely, thus, after funding justifying a greater reduction of taxa tion than would now be expedient, I suggest a postponement of this ques tion until the next meeting of Con gress. TARIFF. It may be advisable to mod ify taxa tion and tariff in instances where un just or burdensame' dIscriminations are made by the present laws; but of a general revision of the laws regulat ing this subject I recommend the post. ponement for the present. 11 INCOME TAx. I also suggest a removal of the tax on incomes, hut at a reduaced rate, and this tax to expire in three years. CUsTOMs. With the funding of the national debt, as here suggested, I feel safe In saying that the taxes and revenue from imports -may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per an num at once, and may be still further reduced from year to year as the re sources of the country are developed. 

FISUAL. 5TATEMENT OF THE GOVERN MENT. Theoreport of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 80th, $370,948,747, and expo 49,0.'h siae o t e en Buidg year ar'e 'more favorable to the Government, and will nto doubt show a muoh larger decrease of the public debts. The receipts in the Treasury beyond the expenditures bave exceed ed the amount neoeeiay to be placed to the eredif, of the sinking fund, as proviea by law. To look up the' surplus-in th 'reasury and withhold it from eirculatiom would lead to sueh a oont.iaotIot of Odrtemley as to lp ple tyde and periously affect. h prosperity of' the country. -Under these oueastanoes the 8eoretory of the Treasury had myself -hartily oon crirred in the pro risty of bein g all the iurpliuu currency In the Treasury in thy purchase of Government bond., thus red uclng the interest-bbatIn in debtedness of thtry , o heldby, Tsenaryamoent t~o $75,.. 0,0,O0, liooluding those of the sink. log fund. I recommend that the whole beg ed s~dbe Mtie the 'with ~ah"pe str mug o brty and ' lf-government. u1 h wbiue a.s sy~mpathuiting it, is agto 19uir hgg~ox tha we should abstain from enf'orcing our views upon unwilling nat ione, and from taking an interested part in quarrels betwen different nations, or hetgeen Governments and their subject. Our course should always be in conforhaity with strict justice and law-international ind local. Such hap beenf the policy of this Administration in dealing with these questions for more than a year. A valuablo province of Spain, and near neighbor of onr-, in whom all our people cannot but feel a deep interest, has been struggling for independence and freedom. The people and Government of the United States entertain the same warns feelings and sympathies for the people of Cuba in their pending struggle that they manifested throughout the previous struggles between Spain and her former colonies in behalf of the latter. The contest has at no time -assumed condi. Lion which amount to war in the senco of international law, or which would the exisietce osf a de facto political organization of the insurgents sufficient to justifv a recognize of belligerency. The principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge of when to accordl the right of belligerency either to a people struggling to free themselves from a Goverment they believe to be oppressive or to independent, nation at war with each other. The United States has no disposition to interfere with the existing relations of Spain to her colonial possession on this continent. They believe that its due time Spain and other European Powers will find their inttest in terminatin.g those relation and establisl.ing their present d.pendent Pow rs These dependencies are no longer regarded as subjects of transfere from one European Power to another. When the present relations of colonies ceases they are to become indepeudent4 Powers, exercising the right ot choice and of self-control in the determination of their future condition and relation with other Powers. The United States, in order to put a atop to the bloodshed in Cuba, and in the interest of t:e neighboring people, proposed its good offices to bring the existing contest to a termination. The offer, not being accept 1y Spain on the basis which we believe could be received by Cuba, was withdrant n. It is hoped that the good offices of the United States may prove advantageous for the settlement of this uihappy strife. In the mean while, a number of illegal expedi. tions against Cuba have been broken up. It has been the endeavor of the Admin istration to execute the neutrality law, no matter how unpleasant the task, made so by the suffering we endured from the lack of like good faith towards us by other nations. 

CKNTRIAL AMERICA---THE DAnIICN CANAL. The inter-oceanic canal, to connect .ie Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Isthmus of Darien, is one in which commerce is greatly interested. In struction have been. given the Minister to the United States of Colombia to endeavor to obtain aitthority fur a survey to determine the practicability of the undertaking. In order to comply with the agreement with the United States of Colombia as to a mixed com mission at Lima, it became necessary to spud a commissioner and secretary to Lima. The good offices of the United States to bring about peace between Spain and the South American republics hiaving been accepted by Spain, Peru, and Chilh, a congress has been invited to held in Washington during the present winter. A grant has beeni given to Europeans of an exerusive right of transit over the territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Rica has given its assent, ; which, it is alleged, conflicts with the vested right of citizens of the United $tates. The Department of State now has the subject under consideration. THEl SPANISh

The Minister to Petu having made representations that there *sa a state of war between Per and Spain, and chat Spain was construeting in and ntear Ne ork thirty gueuboats, which might be osed by Spain to relieve the 1 naval force9 at Cuba to operate against1 Peru, order were given to prevent their departni.

Great even as I that differ once, not a word was found in 'the treaty, and not an inforeiq e could be drawn from it to reiovO , e sense of the unfriendliness of th4 course of Great Britain in our strt te for 'e. istenco which had so dees' and uni versally impressed itself upon the I people of this country. holieving I that a convention thus thiconceived in its provisions would dot hate pro- I duced the hearty, cordiaj settlement of the pending questionseliuh aldne is consistent with the rebltions which [ desire to have firmly esablisbed be tween the United State' and Oret Britain, I regarded the htion of the Senate in the rejection of the treaty to have been wisely tnkeh in the in terest of peace and as i% necessary step in the direction of a perfect and oordial friendship between the two sontries. A sensativo people, conscious of e their power, are more wholly at enae under a great wrong wholly unatoned, than under the restraint of a settle. anont which s itisfes neither their ideas of justice nor their grave sense of the greivance they have sustained. The t rejection of the treaty was followed i by a state of public fooling on both f sides which I thought not favorabib j to an immediate attempt at renewe? 3 negotiations. I accordingly so in struoted the Minister of. the United States to Great Britale, and found , that my views in this, regard were shared by ner Majesty'ts Ministers. j [ hope that the time play t on arrive i when the two Govgrnm It an ap- t proaoh thA a9lutIon, <6f t to ean toUs question with . appreciation of what is due to the rights,' d ignity, and honor of each, and with. the determi. cation not only to remove the causes of complaint in the past, but to lay c the foundation of a broad of principle f public law which will prevent future a 3ifferones, and tend to firm and con- a tinued friendship. This is now the ( )nly grave question which the United ni Btates has with any foreign nation. C NATURALIZED CITIZENS.

It may be well to mention here the mbarrassment possible to arise from eaving on the statute-books the "o 'alled tenure-of-ofLfo acts, and to oar testly recommend their total repeal. t could not have bean the intention f the framers of the Constitution, in roviding that appointments made by he President should receive the con ont of the Bedate, that the latter hould have power to retain in office ersons placed there by Fedoral ap oitments against the will of the 'resident. The law is inconsistent rith a faithful and efficient adminis ration of the Government.
