FONTAINE BROS., Editors and Publishers. VOL XXIV. The reductions in the star route mail service during the month of November were over SOOO,OOO. The postmaster general has authorized the free trans mission through the mails of reports of Agricultural colleges, which the law requires to be interchanged among col leges annually. The amusement season in Washing ton this winter promises to be of unusual interest. The Guiteau farce has been on the hoards about three weeks, and soon the great national cir cus opens on Capitol Hill, to run for six months, There will Ve other minor attractions, but nothing tha* will com pete with the Forth-seventh congress for absorbing interest and variety. The chief clerk of the railway mail service at Des Moines says that only about 40 per cent, of the men who se cured positions as route agents in the government railway mail service are able to retain them. Many imagine that a government position, in the shape of a railway route agency, is a sinecure, but soon find out that it re quires constant practice, a great power of memory, and unwearied diligence. According to every recognized theo ry of mental science, a lunatic cannot feel rem rse for his insane acts, how ever horrible or atrocious they may be. On cross-examination, Guiteau ac knowledged that he felt remorse for his great crime. The prosecution in the case feels that by this one admis sion it has, in effect, broken down the only plea of the defense, that of in sanity. According to the annual report o f Secretary Lincoln, the expenditures of the war department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, were $4 2,122,201 Tiie appropriations for 1882 were $44,- 541,270. Secretary Lincoln heartily in dorses the recommendation of General Sherman that the army be increased to 30,000 men, and calls the attention of congress to the necessity for legislation to prevent intrusion upon Indian lands, especially on the Indian territory, from Kansas. Ik Congress shall adopt the recom mendation of the secretary of the navy, our government will in a few years have a powerful marine army of defense, which it has not had since the close of the rebellion. In the event of war with a foreign power, our great danger would he from naval attacks along our sea-board, and this peril could he ef fectually met only by a formidable navy. Let us, then, renew our navy as soon as possible. McDonald, the jockey who rode the American colt Foxhall in the Cesare witch, and was subsequently killed by the falling of Buchanan, in the Liver pool Cup, was approached by a life in surance agent just bofore the start for the last named race, and solicited to in sure his life for $5,000. live offer was laughingly refused, hut before the race had been half run Buchanan fell and McDonald received injuries which re sulted in his death. E. F. Camleton, mayor of Port Hu ron, Mich., and chairman of the relief committee at that city, for the distribu tion of aid to the fire-sufteiers of that region, has published a card thanking the citizens of the United States and the provinces of Canada for their noble aid to the stricken people of the fire burnt district, and.suggesting that all moneys collected up to date, and still in the hands of the committee he forwarded at once, so that the committee may he able to measure the amount that will be required to tide the sufferers over the winter. A conflagration occurred in the mill district of Minneapolis, destroying property to the value of $410,000 up on which there is insurance aggregat ing $208,5000; besides causing the death of four men and the injury of many others. At about 4 o’clock in the morning the fire broke out in the flouring mill known as the Pillsbury B, owned and operated by C. A. Pillsbury & Cos. This mill had been for some time idle, and it is therefore not known whether the fire originated from gas or from flour dust. The fire next spread to the Excelsior mill, operated by C. A. Pillsbury A Cos.; to the Minne apolis mill, owned and operated by Crocker, Fisk A Cos.; to the Empire mill, owned by F. L. Watson and op erated by C. A. Pillsbury & Cos.; and to a cotton mill owned by Dorillus Morri son — a il of these structures and their contents being totally destroyed. In the Minneapolis mill an explosion oc curred, killing Cornelius Fredericks, first assistant engineer of the fire de partment. Another explosion killed three persons, fatally wounded another, and inflicting more or less serious in juries upon several people. It is pos sible that a search among the ruins may reveal other fatalities. The daily flouring capacity of the mills destroyed was 2,500 barrels, or one-tenth the ca pacity of all the Minneapolis mills. TELKGRAFHK’. Condensed for Convenient and Ready Reading. WASHINGTON. The president lias accepted a twentv five mile section of the Northern Pacific road lying in Idaho. The decision in the Whittaker *ase has been sent to Secretary Lincoln. Army of ficers assume that it will he unfavorable to the colored cadet. Three postmistresses are iu Washing ton seeking reappointment. Mrs. Thomp son, of Louisville, has a strong letter from Mrs. Garfield. The wife of John Davis, the president’s private secretary, is to be ti e lady of the white house.

The senate committee on elections ha*, asked to be discharged from the considera tion of the case against Senator Miller, of New York, there being no basis for the allegation of irregularity or fraud. In the senate Mr. Logan introduced a hill fur the erection of a public building at Quincy, 111., and Mr. Ingalls presented a measure for the admission of New Mex ico into the union. Mr. Hoar offered a resolution lor a special committee to con sider all documents referring to woman suffrage. About all that is positively known of President Arthur’s cabinet is that Mr. Frelinhuysen will succeed Mr. Blaine at.the head of the State Department, with Judge J. C. Bancroft Davis as First As sistant Secretary of State. This will take Judge Davis from the Court of Claims, and leave an opening for Secretary Hunt when he vacates the Navy Department.. •Custodian Pitney, who was dismissed in disgrace from the treasury department, is preparing a statement for the investi gating committee. It is said that he will charge that Secretary Sherman ordered the furnishing of his campaign headquar ters from treasury supplies, and that S7OO worth of stationery was accordingly sent across the street to the Corcoran building. Apparently, the only changes to be made in the cabinet will be those of Fre linghuysen for Blaine and Brewster for MacVeagh. It is positively announced that Secretary Hunt will retain his port folio, ami Postmaster Genera! James and Secretary Lincoln state that they will continue to serve. It is reported that Secretary Kirkwood has been asked by the president to remain in the interior de partment. The United States senate was convened by Acting Vice President Davie. Neither of the South Carolina senators wa? pres ent. William Windom was duly qual fied as senator from Minnesota. John Sherman introduced a 3 per cent, funding bill; Mr. Beck a measure to recoin the trade dollars into standard pieces; Mr. Miller a bill to enforce treaty stipulations relating to the Chinese, and Mr. Logan an act to place General Grant on the re tired list of the army.

A great commotion was caused in Birk enhead, England, by the explosion of the purifying house of the glass works. No lives were lost. The dead lock in the silk trade in Japan has been broken by the surrender of the American and European merchants, re leasing $5,000,000 worth of goods to west ern markets. The authorities at Dublin have learned that midnight drills are being held. A crowd at Limerick stoned the carriage of Mrs. Considine, on whose property evic tions recently occurred, severely injuring her. A farmer named Rooney was bru tally beaten at Athlone for paying rent. The fall of a lamp on the stage ignited the Ring theater at Vienna, just as it had been tilled with spectators. In the confu sion which instantly nrevailed, the iron portion separating the stage from the auditorium was left raised. A small por tion of the audience saved themselves by leaping from the third story windows, and sixty were rescued by means of ladders. The loss of life is estimated at 300. Many corpses were consumed in the galleries. Among the missing are Herr Fife, the c*urt musical director, and Herr Helmer sperger. Most of the bodies thus far iden tified are those of tradesmen and minor officials. CRIME. A notorious character of Pittsburg, called Bloody Abernethy, shot dead his associate, Culley Leslie, in a Diamond street saloon. William Allen, a negro murderer, was taken from the jail at Warwick Court- House, Virginia, by masked men and hang to a tree. At Edgerton, Mo„ last September, Na than Andrews was murdered by Clay Snell, since which date five members of the lat ter's family have died, three of them from shame and grief.

A check for $3,000, raised from S3O in a manner to deceive the best judges, was presented at the Merchants’ Exchange bank in Milwaukee the other day, and would have been paid had not the cashier thought best to ascertain by telephone if the amount was staled correctly. When he learned the true figures the young man had disappeared from the counter. M illiam Burke, a professional sneak hief, said to hail from Cnicago, was ar rested at an express office in Buffalo for stealing $117,000 in bonds from D.

Tiiifi pedestrian contest in Chicago be tween Rowell and Dobler was a hoi one for twenty miles, when the latter gave out. A mail-pouch stolen from Garret’s Sta tion, Tex,, contained $17,000, and was found on the prairie, unopened. Maj. Wm. Arthur, the president's only brother, is to take a position on the staffof General Hancock. He lias been stationed at Fort Benton as paymaster for the past three years. Alexander Boyden, the inventor of malleable iron, who for years has been in the almshouse at Foxboro, Mass., passed away at the age of 91. The Boston banks have discovered that in carting coin to settle balances at the clearing house a weekly loss of S3OO takes place by reduction of weight. Lieut. Flipper slated to the court martial that ne had never appropriated a penny of government money, or permitted it to be done, and that his troubles arose in keeping funds in his trunk. The Pacific Mail Steamship company aroused the disgust of the overland rail roads by demanding a restoration of the subsidy of $110,(XX) per month. Dillon and Huntington walked out of the conference, and ocean freights will be taken at any price. ii The Grand Trunk managers have built six monster locomotives and imported soms English engineers, and threaten to run trains from Montreal to Chicago at the rale of sixty miles per hour, including stoppages. Influential Canadians waited upon the premier at Ottawa to obtain a commu tation for Hayvern, who killed a fellow uonvict in St. Vincent de Paul peniten tiary. The law will take its course, and the murderer will be hanged in Montreal at once. Short ami Long Hauls on Railroads. Last summer the New York Cham ber of Commerce propounded some leading questions to the railroad mana gers of the country in respect to the charges on freight and transportation, and among them was the following concerning long and short hauls: What do you think of the practice of charging more for a short than for a long distance? For instance $4 per 100 pounds from New York to Salt Lake City, and $2.50 from New York to San Francisco? One of the railroad officers makes the following answer: If the railroad company were able to fix the rates from New York to Sait Lake City, and also the rates from New York to San Francisco, and should, ar bitrarily, make the lesser rate for the longer distance, it would be very fool ish. It would be simply equivalent to making a present of that much money to the San Francisco shippers, and. while there might not be anything par ticularly wrong in it, it would hardly be considered a business transaction. But if the rate from New York to Salt Lake City is in itself reasonable, and less than the service is worth; and if the rate from New York to San Francisco was already less by water route than the route to Salt Lake City, then the railroad would be entirely right to compete in San Francisco for New York business at whatever rates it could *,et. By being free to do this, it could gam a considerable new business. Profits from this business would help to pay its expenses and interest, and contribute that much to reducing the average rates, which it could afford to make to Salt Lake City, and all other points along its iine. A moment’s re flection w T ill show that Salt Lalt City is one of the places against which nature has discriminated most heavily of all places of the continent, being surround ed by mountains and deserts. Before railroads were built, while the rate from New York to San Francisco —1,000 miles farther—was, perhaps, as now, $2 50, the rate to Salt Lake City was, perhaps, 

SIOO. Here, then, was a nat ural discrimination of $97.50 against Salt Lake City. Ihe railroad has re duced that discrimination to $1.50. \V henever the railroad can secure a still larger amount of through busi ness from San Francisco, and, perhaps, from China and Japan, so as to reduce its average expenses, the rate to Salt Lake can be still further reduced, and the discrimination lessened, so that, in fact, the discrimination, which enables a road to secure San Francisco busi ness, is in the true interests of Salt Lake shippers. Take another case illustrating the same principle : Corinth, Miss., at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio and the Memphis and Charleston railroads, is ninety-three miles from Memphis, and 238 miles from Mobile. A reasonable local rate on a bale of cotton from Corinth to Memphis would be, say $1 per bale. Memphis is about as good a cotton market as Mobile. Consequently, all the cotton raised in the vicinitv of Corinth will go to Memphis, unless'the rate to Mobile is made the same as to Memphis. Between Corinth and Mo bile, however, are many stations where much cotton is brought for shipment. M e will take Tupelo as an illustration, 280 miles from Mobile. Now% if s'. a bale is a reasonable rate for ninet3 T -three miles, the rate from Tupelo to Mobile 280 miles—might very well he $2. If, therefore, the Mobile and Ohio road competes in the market at Corinth for cotton, it will be charging less for the longer haul from Corinth than for the shorter from Tupelo. And, if the law should step in and forbid this nractice, the Mobile and Ohio road would simply have to withdraw from competition at Corinth. The shipper at Tupelo claims that the Mobile and Ohio road is discriminating against him when it hauls Corinth cot ton for $1 and charges $2 from Tupelo. But would it benefit him to have the road give up all Corinth cotton and withdraw from competition at that place? It could not afford to reduce at Tupelo, and twenty other stations similarly situated, in order to secure a few hundred bales from Corinth at a low rate. It would then be less able to reduce rates at Tupelo, and all other local points on its line; and nobody on earth would be benefited but the Mem phis and Charleston railroad, which would have a monopoly of the hauling of Corinth cotton, and Corinth would Use the benefit of competition from the Gulf. The effect of any law to restrict the freedom of roads to act in this manner would*|impiy destroy competition. Take another example, illustrating the same thing, except that the com petition is between a railroad and a water route. Fond du Lac, Wia., is 148 miles from Chicago, on the line of the Chicago & Northwestern railway. The lumbering interest is very large there, and the products of the saw mills, shingle mills, and sash, door and blind factories are nearly all shipped to Chicago, the great distributing point for the northwest. A car-load of lum ber from Fond du Lac to Chicago, load ed and unloaded by the owner, costs (say) $25, Green Bay is G 5 miles far ther up the line than Fond du Lac, or 213 miles from Chicago. Green Bay is largely interested in the lumber busi ness also, hut it has the advantage of being on the neck of Lake Michigan, and ships nearly all its lumber to Chi cago on vessels, which is cheaper than by rail. On a certain day the North western railroad has a dozen empty cars standing on the side track at Green Bay that are to be returned to Chicago. A lumber dealer telegraphs the General Manager that he will pay twenty dollars per car for their use from thence to Cnicago, and load and unload them himself. The offer is at once accepted, the service performed, and two hundred and forty dollars is paid into the treasury of the company. The price paid was, say five dollars per car less than the rate from Fond du Lac, with sixty-five miles more haul. But the choice was between two hun dred and forty dollars and nothing, for the cost, to a railroad company, be tween hauling loaded and empty cars is of nominal account. There is a little more wear and tear, and a few pounds more steam, but the extra expense is inconsiderable. The lumbermen at Fond du Lac are indignant at what they call “ the unjust discrimination ” of the railroad company in favor of their rivals in business at Green Bay, and the irate newspapers at the former place call loudly for a pro-rata tariff. Nobody complains that $25 per car is too high from Fond du Lac to Chicago, but the idea that it should cost only S2O per car-load for a haul that is sixty five miles farther away from market is what worries them. Now, if the Northwestern Railway company had been prohibited from making this special agreement by the enforcement of an inflexible pro-rata tariff act, it would have benefited no body but damaged (1) the railroad cor poration to the amount of S3OO, (|OO to be added for drawing empty cars); (2) it would have injured the lumbermen at Green Bay, because it would have deprived them of taking advantage of competition, and placed them wholly in the power of the vessel owners; and (3) it would have damaged the lumber men of Fond du Lac, because, being prevented from competing with the water route from Green Bay, the rail road corporation must make up its loss by keeping up its high rates at the for mer place. A Signal Evidence of Health I? a regularly recurring action of the bowels. V ith the due performance of this function are united good digestion, pure and active circula t on ot the blood, and an adequate secretion of healthy bile, which seeks the conduits designed for it by nature. The performance of these co operative functions, insuring permanent health and vigor, may, if interrupted, speedily be ren dered active and regular with that finest of mod ern restoratives of organic activity and general health. Hostetter’s Stomach Bitters. While it relaxes the bowels effectually, it does so without pain, and without giving rise to the violent, weakening re-action always to be anticipated from a drastic purgative. The drenching effect, associated in the minds of many ill-advised per sons with thoroughness as its essential, is ruinous to the stomach and intestines, organs that are. on the contrary, invigorated by the Bitters, which is. moreover, a superb preventive and rem edy for fever and ague, and a proven specific for rheumatism, debility and kidney inactivity. Among the witnesses in the Guiteau trial was Emory A. Storrs, of Chicago. He thinks Guiteau responsible for his crime. The Trenotn (N. J.) Gazelle mentions the case of Mr. John Wood, with the American Pottery Cos,, that city, who was cured by St, Jacobs Oil of an attack of rheumatism whicU had confined him to his bed for seventeen weeks. He praises it unstintedly. ZZ Mrs. Emily Nan Allen, who died in New York recently, was one of the four daughters of Mr. William Astor. She led a quiet life, but had a large circle of friends devoted to her for the remarkable sweetness of her manners, her generous disposition, and her un ostentatious charities. She died loved by all who knew her, a noble example of a Christian wife and mother. Windsor, Forsyth Cos., N. C. Gent* — l desire to express to you my thanks for your wonderful Hop Bitters. ’ I was troubled with dyspepsia for five years previous to com mencing the use of jour Hop Bitters some six months ago. My cure has been wond,rful. I am pastor of the First Methodist Church of this place, and my whole congregation can testify to the great virtues of your Bitters. Very Respectfully, REV. H. FEREBEE. General Robert Toombs says; “Gui teau ought to be kicked to death by a mule.” President's Message. DELIVERED TO CONGRESS DEC. OtII.. ISSI. To the Senate and of Representatives of the United States: An appalling calamity has befallen the Ameri can people since their chosen representatives last met in the halls where you are now assembled. We might else recall with unaltered content the rare prosperity with which throughout the year the nation has been blessed. Its harvests have beea plenteous. Its various industries have thriv en. The health of its people has been preserved. It has maintained with foreign governments the undisturbed relations of amity and peace. For these manifestations of Ilis favor we owe to Him who holds our destiny in His hands, the tribute of our grateful devotions to that mysteri ous exercise of will, which has taken from us the beloved and illustrious citizen, who was but lately the head of this nation. We bow in ssrrow—submission. The memory of his exalted character, of his achieve ments, and of his patriotic life, will be treasured forever as a sacred possession of tho whole people. The announcement of his death drew from for eign governments and peoples tributes of sympa thy and sorrow which history will record as signal tokens of the kinship of nations and the federa tion of mankind. 

GOOD WILL PREVAILS. The feeling of good will between our own gov ernment and that of Great Britain was never more marked than at present. In recognition of the pleasing fact, I directed, on the occasion of the late centennial celebration at Yorktown that a salute be given to the British flag. OCR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. Save for the correspondence, to which I shall refer hereafter, in relation to the proposed canal across the isthmus of Panama, little has occurred worthy of mention in the diplomatic relations of the country. Early in the year the Fortune Bay claims were satis actorily settled by the British government paying in full the sum of £15,000, most of which has already been distributed, as the terms of the settlement, which included com pensation for injuries suffered by our fishermen at Ashec Bay. There has been retained from the gross award a sum which is deemed adequate for these claims. CONFERENCE. The participation of Americans in the exhi bitions at Melbourne and Sydney will be ap provingly mentioned in the reports of the two exhibitions soon to he presented to con gress. They will disclose the readiness of our countrymen t-i make a successful competition in distant fields of enterprise. Negotiations for an international copy-right treaty are in hopeful 81STING BULL, progress. The surrender of Sitting Bull and his force upon the Canadian frontier has allayed all apprehension, although bodl.s of British Indians still cross the border in quest of sustenance. Up ju this subject a correspondence has been opened which promises an adequat e understanding. Our troops have orders to avoid, in the meanwhile, all collisions with alien Indians. YORKTOWN, The presence at the Yorktown celebration of representatives of republicans, descendants of La fayette and of his gallant compatriots, who were uur allies in the revolution, has served to strength en the spirit of good will which has always exist ed between the two nations. BIMETALLIC. _ You will be furnished with the proceedings oi th" bimetallic conference, held during the summer at the city of Paris. No accord was reached, but a valuable interchange of views was had, and the conference will next year bo renewed. At th electrical exhibition and congress, also held *.i Paris, this country was eredibly represented by •.Tninent specialists, who, in the absence of an ap propriation, generously lent their efficient aid at the instance of the state department; while our exhibition in tbit almost distinctively American field ot achievement has won several awards. I recommend that congress provide for the re payment of the personal expenses incurred in the public interest by tho honorary commis fioners and delegates. STATUS OF GERMAN CITIZENS, No iew question respecting the status of our naturalized citizens in Germany have arisen dur ing the past year and the causes of complaint especially in Alsace and Lorraine have practically ceased through the liberal action of the imperia government, in accepting our often expressed views on the subject. The application of the treaty of 1868, to the lately acquired Rhenish provinces has received very earnest attention and a definite and lasting agieement on this point is confidently expected. The participation of the descendants of Baron von Steuben in the York town festivities, and their subsequent reception by their American kinsmen, strikingly coincides with the goodwill which unites the German people with our own. SPAIN. Our intercourse with Spain has been frien-ily and the agreement concluded in February last fixes a term for the labors for the Spanish ann American claims commission. The Spanish gov ernment has been requested to pay the late awards of the commission and will, it is believed, accede to the request as promptly and courteously as on former occasions. By recent legislation on rom, a fine has been imposed upon American shipping in Spanish and colonial ports, for slight irregulari ties. One case of hardship is epeeially worthy of mention. The bark Masonica, bound lor Japan entered Manilla in distress and is THERE SOUGHT TO BE CONFISCATED under the Spanish revenue lav.’S tor an alleged shortage in her transhipped cargo. Though ef forts for her relief has thus far proved unavailing it is expected that the whole will be adjusted in a friendly spirit. RUSSIA, The senate resolutions of condolence on the assassination of the Czar Alexander 11. were appropriately communicated to the Russian government, which in turn has expressed its sym pathy in our late national bereavement. It is desirable that our cordial relations with Russia should he strengthened by proper engagements, assuring to peaceful Americans who visit that empire the consideration which is due to them as citizens of a friendly state. This is' especially needful with respect to American Isrealites whose classification with the native Hebrews has evoked energetic remonstrances from this govern ment. ITALY. Our consular agreement with Italy has been sanctioned and proclaimed in the case of crimes on shipboard. Several important international congresses have been held in Italy during the year. At the geographical congress of Venice, the art congress of Milan and the peace congress of Turin this country was represented by delegates from branches of the public service or by private citizens duly accredited in an honorary capacity. It is hoped that congress will vc such prominence to the results of their par ticipation as they may seem to deserve. HOLLAND. The abolition wf all discriminating duties against Dutch colonial productions of the Dutch East Indies as are imported hither from Hol land, has been air* ady considered by congress. I trust that at the p -esent session the matter may be favorably concluded. TURKEY The msecuiity of life and property in many parts of Turkey has given rise to correspondence with the porte, looking, particularly to the bet ter protection of American missionaries in the empire. The condemned murderer of the eminent mis sionary Dr. J- ;tin W. Parsons, has not yet been executed, although this government has repeated ly demanded that exemplary justice be done. SWITZERLAND. The Swiss government has solicited the good offices of our diplomatic and consular agents for the protection of its citizens in countries where it is not itself represented. This request has, within proper limits, been granted. Our agents in Switz erland have been instructed to protest against the condue; of the authorities of certain communes in permitting the emigration to this country of crim inals and other objectionable persons. Several such persons, through the co-operation of the commissioners of emigration at New York, have been sent hack by the steamer which brought them. A continuance of this course may prove a more effective remedy than diplomatic remon strance. ROC-MANIA AND SERVIA, The treaties of commerce and navigation for the regulation of consular privileges, have been con cluded with Roumania and Servia, since their ad mission into the family of Europeans. MEXICO. As is natural with contiguous states with like institutions and like aims of advancement anl de velopment, the friendship of the United States and Mexico Las been constantly maintained. The government has lost no occasion of encouraging the Mexican gov ernment, and a beneficial realization of the mutual advantages which will result from more intimate commercial intercourse and from the opening of the rich interior of Mexican railway enterprise. I deem it important that means be provided to restrain the lawlessness, unfortunate ly common on the frontier, and to suppress the forays of the reservation. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES, The neighboring states of Central America bavr preserved internal peace, and their outward relations toward the United States have been those of intimate friendship. There are encouraging signs of their growing disposition to subordinate their local interests to those which are common to them b\ reason of their geographical relations. The boundary dispute between Guatemala and Mexico has offered this government an oppor tunity to exercise its good offices for preventing a inpture between these states and for procuring a feaceful solution of the question. I cherish a strong hope that in view of our relations ot amity with both countries our frendly counsel* will prevail. The Costa Rican government lately formed an engagement with Columbia lor settling, by arbi tration, the boundary question between thosi countries, providing that the post of arbitrants should be offered successively to the King of the Belgians, the King of Spain, and the President of the Argentine Confederation. The King of the Belgians has declined to act, but I am not as yei advised of the action of the King of Spain. As we have certain interests in the disputed territory which are protected by our treaty engagement with one of the parties, it is important that the arbitration should not without our consent affect our rights, and this government has accord ingly thought proper to make its views known to the parties to the agreement, also to intimate them to the Belgian government. THE 

CANAL QUESTION. The question growing out of the proposed in • ter-oeeanic water way aeross the isthmus o' Mana ma. are of grave national importance. This government has not been unmindful of the solemn obligations imposed up on it by its compact of 1846, with Columbia as the independent sovereign mis tress of the territory crossed by the eanal, and has sought to render them effective by fresh engage inents with the Columbian republic looking to their practical execution. The negotiations to this end, after they had reached what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory solution here, were met in Columbia by a disavowal of the powers which its envoy had assumed, and by a proposal for negotiation on a modified basis. Mean while this government learned that Co lumbia bad proposed to the European powers to join in a guarantee of the neutrality of the proposed Panama canal. A guarantee which would be in direct contravention of the integrity of the Columbian Territory and of the neutrality of the canal itself. My lamented pre decessor felt it his duty to place before the Eu ropean powers the reasons which make the prior guarantee of the United States indisnensable, and for which the interjection of any foreign guaran tee might be regarded as a superfluous and un friendly act. Eoreseeing the probable reliance of the British government on the provisions of the Ciayton- Bulwer treaty of 1850, affording room for a share in the guarantees which the United States covenants with Columbia four years before, I have not hesitated to supplement the action of my predecessor by proposing to her majesty’s government the modification of those instru ments and the abrogation of such clauses thereof as do not compare with the obligations of the United States toward Columbia or with the vital needs of the two friendly parties to the compact. CHILI AND PERU. This government sees with great concern the continuance of the hostilities between Chid, Boli via and Peru, and early peace between these re publics is much to be desired not only that they may themselves bo spared further misery and bloodshed, because their continued antagonism threatens consequences which arc in my judg ment dangerous to the interests of republican gov ernment on this continent, and calculated to de • stray the best elements of our freo and peaceful civilization. As in the present excited condition of the popu lar feeling in these countries,there has been serious misapprehensions of the position of the United States, and as separate diplomatic inter course with each through independent ministers is some times subject, owing to the want oi prompt reciprocal communication to temporary misunderstanding. I have deemed it judicious at the present time, to send a special envoy accredit ed to all and each of them, and furnished with general instructions which will enable him to bring these powers into friendly relations. 

VENEZUELA. The government of Venezuela maintains its at titude of warm friendship, and continues, with great regularity, its payment of the monthly quota of the diplomatic debt. Without suggest ing the direction in which congress should ac*, 1 ask attention to the pending questions affecting the distribution of the sums thus far received. The relations between Venezuela and France, growing out of the same debt, nave been for some time past in an unsatisfactory state, and this gov ernment's the neighbor and one of the largest creditors of Venezuela, has interposed itself since with the French government with the view of pro ducing a friendly and honorable adjustment. BRAZIL. I regret that the commercial interests between the United States and Brazil, from which great advantages were hoped a year ago, have suficred from the withdrawal of the American line ot communication between Brazilian ports and ours. Through the efforts of our minister resident a( Buenos Ayres and the United States minister at Santiago, a treaty has been concluded between the Argentine Republic and Chili, disposing ol the long pending Patagonia boundary question. It is a matter of congratulation that our govern ment has been afforded the opportunity of suc cessfully exerting its good influence for the pre vention of disagreements between the Republics of the American continent. 

CHINA. I am glad to inform you that the treaties lately negotiatid with China have been duly ratified on both sides, and the exchange made at Pekin. Legislation is necessary to call its provisions into effect. The prompt and friendly manner in which the Chinese government, at the request ol the United States, conceded the modification ol treaties, should secure careful regard for the interests and susceptibilities of that government in the enactment of any laws relating to Chinese emigration. The classes of the treaties which forbid the paiticipation of citizens or vessels of the United States in the opium trade, will doubtless receive your approval, and they will attest the sincere in terest which our people and government in the commendable efforts of the Chine government to put a stop to this demoralizing and destructive traffic. In relation both to China and Japan some changes are desirable in our present system of counsel or jurisdiction. I hope at some future time to lay before you a scheme for its improve ment in the entire east. 

JAPAN. The intimacy between our country and Japan the most advanced of eastern rations, continues to be cordial. I am advised that the emperar contemplates the establishment of a constitutional government, and that he has already summoned a parliamentary congress for the purpose of ef fecting the change. Such a remarkable step to ward the complete assimilation with the western system cannot fail to bring Japan to a closer and more beneficial relationship with ourselves as the chief Pacific power. THE JOHN BOSS CASE. _ A question has arisen in relation to the exer cise in that country of the judicial function car ried on by eur ministers and consuls. The in dictment, trial and conviction in the consular CAurt atYokohnma, of John Ross, a merchant seaman on board an American vessel have made it necessary for the government to institute a careful examination, and the nature and methods of this j an.-diction. It appeared Ro/s was regularly shipped under protection of the United States, but was by birth a British subject. My successor felt it his ddty to retain the position that in his service as a regular shipped seaman on board an American merchant vessel Ross was subject to the laws ef the service and to the jurisdiction of the United States consular authorities. A RECOMMENDATION. I renew the recommendation which has been heretofore urged by the executive upon the attention of congress, that after the reduction of such amount as may be found due to American citizens, the balance of the indemnity fund here tofore, obtained from China and Japan, and which are now in the hands of the state depart ment, be returned to the governments of those countries. Hawaii. The king of Hawaii, in the coarse of his home ward return after a journey around the world, has lately visited this country. While our relations with that king are friendly, this government has viewed with concern the efforts to seek replenish ment of the diminishing population of the island from outward sources to a degree which may im pair the native sovereignty and independence in which the United States ’was among the first to testify a lively interest. OTHER NATIONS. Relations of unimpaired amity have been main tained throughout the year with the respective governments of Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Den mark. Hayti, Paraguay and Uruguay, Portugal, and Sweden and Norway, and this may also be said of Greece and Eqaador. Although our re lations with these states have for several years been severed by the withdrawal of appropriations for diplomatic representatives a. Athens andQu.to it seems expedient to restore those missions, even on a reduced scale, and I decidedly recommend such a course with respect to Equador. which is likely within the near future to play an important part among the nations of the Southern Pacific. THE GENEVA CONVENTION. , At its last extra session the senate called for the text of the resolutions of the Geneva conven tion for the relief of the wounded in the war. I tiust that this action foreshadows such interest in ihe subject as will result in the admission to that humane and commendable engagement. NEW INTERNATIONAL RULES. I invite your attention to the propriety of adopting the new code of international rules for the prevention of collisions on the high seas and of conforming the domestic legislation of the United States thereto, so that no confusion may arise from the application of conflictisg rules in the case of vessels of differ ent nationalities meeting in tidal waters. These international rules differ but slightly from our own. They have been adopted by the navy department for the government of the war ships of the United States, on the high seas and foreign waters, and through the action of the state department in disseminating the rules and in acquainting the ship masters with the option of conforming to them without the jurisdictional waters of the United States. They are now very generally known and obeyed. The state department still continues to publish to the country the trade and manufacturing reports received from its officers abroad. The success of this course warrants its continuance, and such appropriations as may be required to meet the rapidly increasing demand for these publications, with special reference to the Atlanta cotton expo sition. The accounts of a number of the reports was devoted to a valuable collectb-n of papers on the cotton goods trade of the world. INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE. The international conference for which the con gress of 1878 made provision, assembled in this city in January last, and its sessions were pro longed till March. Although it reached no speci fic conclusions affording future actions ot the participant powers, the interchange of views proved to he most valuable. Protocols of the ses sions have been already presented to the senate. NATIONAL BOARD OF HEALTH. As pertinent to this general subject, I call your attention to the operations ot the national board of health established by congress, approved March 3, 1879. Its sphere of duty was enlarged by the act of June 2d, in the same year. By the last named act the board was required to institute such measures as might he deemed necessary for preventing the introduction of contageous or in fectious diseases from foreign countries into the United States, or from one state into another. The execution of the rules and regulations prepared by the board and approved by my predecessor, has done much to arrest the progress of epidemic diseases and has thus rendered substantial ser vice to the nation. The inter-national sanitary conference to which I have referred, adopted a form of a bill on health to be used by all vessels seeking to enter the ports of the countries whose represen tatives participated in the deliberations. This form has been preserved by our National Board of Health and incorporated with its rules and regulations which have been unproved by me in pursuance of law. The health of the people is of supreme importance. All measures looking to their preservation against the species of con tagious diseaseas, and the increase of our sani tary knowledge for such purpose deserve atten tion of congress. EXPENSES. The report of the secretary of the treasury represents in detail a highly satisfactory exhibit of the state and condition of the various brandies of the public service administered by that de partment. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 10,1881, were: From customs, $198,159,670.02; from in ternal revenue, $135,264,385.51; from public lands, $2,221,803.17; from tax of circulation and deposits of national banks. $8,116,115.72; from repayment of interest by Pacific railway companies, SBIO,- 833.80; irom sinking iund for Pacific railway companies, $805,180.54; from custom fees, fines, penalties, etc., $1,225,514.86; from fees, consu lar letters, patents ajid land. $22,244,984.99; from proceeds of sa’es of government property, $262,174; from profits on coinage, $3,468,485.61; from revenues of the District of Columbia, $2,- 016,199.23: from miscellaneous sources, $6,206,- 880.13. Total ordinary receipts, $36,078,229.61. The ordinary expenditures for the same per iid were: For civil expenses, $17,941,177.19; for foreign intercourse, $1.093,954.92; for Indians, $6,514,161.09; for pensions, $50,050,279.62; for the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements and arsenals, $40,- 466,460.55; for naval establishments in holding vessels, machinery and improvement at navy yards, $15,080,671.66; for miscellaneous expen ditures, including public building, light house and collecting the revenue, $41,837,280.57; for expenditures on account of the District of Co lumbia, $3,543,912.03; for interest on the public debt, $8,258,741.18; for premium of bonds pur chased, $161,268.78; total ordinary expendi tures. 2,607,128.875.90: leaving a surplus of reve nue of $100,( 69,404.98. Which was applied as follows: To the redemption of bonds for the sinking fund $7,437,120,000 00 Fractional currency for sink ing fund 109,001 05 Loan of February, 1861 7,418,000 00 10-4 s of 1864 2,010,150 00 5 20’s of 1862 183,000 00 5-20’s of 1864 34,000 00 5-20’s of 1865 373,000 00 Consuls of 1865 1,431,500 00 1866 959,150 00 1867 959,150 00 1868 337,400 00 Loan indemnity stock 10,000 00 Old demand, compound inter est and other notes 18,830 00 And to the increase of cash in the treasury 14 637,022 93 Total, $100,069,404.98. The requirements of the sinking fund for the year amounted to $90,786,- 064.02, which sum includes a balance of $49,817,- 128.78 net, provided for during the previous fiscal year. The sum of $74,430,201.05 was applied to this fu_l which left a deficit of $16,205,873.47. The increase of the revenues for 1881, over those of the previous year was $29,352,901.10. It is estimated that the receipts during the fiscal year will /each $400,000,000 and the expen ditures $270,000,000, leaving a surplus of $130,- 000,000. In pursuance of the policy of the government to maintain silver at or near the gold standard, silver certificates were accordingly issued and made receivable for all customs, taxes and public dues. About sixty-six millions of them are now outstanding. They formed an unnecessary addition to the paper currency, a sufficient amount of which may be readily sup plied by the national banks in accord ance with the act of February 28th 1878 : the treasury department has monthly caused at least two millions in value of silver bullion to be coined into standard silver dollars. One hundred and two million of these dollars have been already coined, while only about thirty-four millions are in circulation. For the reasons which he specifies, I concur in the Secre tary’s recommendation that the provision for coinage of a fixed amount each month be re pealed, and that hereafter only so much be coined as shall be necessary to supply the de mand. GOLD CERTIFICATES. The secretary advises that the issue of gold certificates should not for the present he resumed, and suggests that the national banks may prop erly be forbid ien by law to retire their currency except npc_ reasonable notice of their intention so to do. Such legislation would seem to be justi fied by the recent action of certain basks on the occasion referred to in the secretary’s report. Of the $15,000,000 fractional curr ney still out standing only about
