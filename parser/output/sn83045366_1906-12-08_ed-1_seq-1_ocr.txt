Sussman, """used of murdering his young wife wnile in the Glenwood hotel on Sept. 26, hve been chosen. When the last man had been accepted and sworn shortly before noon today the judge, triers, attorneys, court officers, and spectators gave signs of relief. The defendant alone seemed sorry that the end of the tedious work had come. He moved uneasily in his chair and as he looked over the twelve men in the jury box his unhealthy pallor seemed a shade more pronounced. Jurors Favored Guests. After a long consultation between Judge D. F. Simpson and the attor neys, during which the crowd stared, whispered and wondered, the judge an nounced that court would be adjourned until 9:30 Monday morning. This was done so that the opening", statement of the state's attorney could be followed immediately by the introduction of evi dence and the case could be presented In a logical and continuous form. The judge instructed Deputy Sheriffs Mal chow and Lindquist to take good care of the imprisoned furors during the ad journment. The jurors will be given a theater party tonight, will be allowed to go to church tomorrow and will be given every possible liberty consistent with the isolation in which the, law pro vides they must be kept. Monday morning will be a red letter day for the morbid curiosity seekers. Judging from the crowds that have persistently attended court during the tiresome procedure of the last four days, it will require the services of a small battalion of police to manage the on lookers. Special arrangements have been made by Sheriff J. W. Dreger, who will be assisted in caring for the crowds by the police department. The proceedings will be commenced Continued on 2d Page, 2d Column. m***KIWK^ Supplementary to the details of the route from Glenham, S. D., to Butte, already published in The Journal, the Milwaukee road has issued the statement of the route of its transcon tinental line from Butte to the coast. Prom Butte, at the foot of the west slope of the Eockies, the line follows the Deer Lodge, Hell Gate, Missoula and St. Regis rivers to a point about four miles west of Saltese, Mont., where the ascent of the Bitter Root mountains begins. St. Paul pass, the summit, is reached at an elevation of 4,200 feet, and a tunnel 8,500 feet long will be necessary to cross the range. The line then follows the drainage of the St. Joe river to within a few miles of its mouth, and crosses the Idaho-Washing ton state line just east of Tekoa, Wash. The country between Saltese and the mouth of the St. Joe river is heavily timbered with white pine and cedar. From Tekoa to the Columbia river a fine agricultural district is traversed, the eastern part of which is very well settled. Great Bridge Projected. The Columbia river is crossed by a bridge of fifteen spans having a total length of 2,750 feet, exclusive of steel trestle approaches 1,000 feet in length at each end. The steel in this structure will weigh 40,000 tons. The grade line is eighty feet above low water. The piers will be of concrete. At Johnson Creek summit, about twenty miles west of the Columbia river, there will be a tunnel 3,400 feet in length, and at Snoqualmie pass there will eventually be a tunnel about two miles long at a maximum elevation of 2,569 feet, but for the present the operations thru the pass will be by a surface line at a maximum elevation of 3,010 feet. Vast forests .of fir, red cedar and other valuable timber are tributary to the line between the Columbia river and Puget sound. At Maple Valley, Wash., connection is made with the Columbia & Puget Sound railroad, over the tracks of which access is obtained to the ample: terminal property purchased at Seattle. A new line will be constructed from Black River Junction, Wash., to Taco ma, where a large amount of terminal property has also been secured. The Un.%. from Glenham to Butte is under cohltaaflt-to-Mcintosh Brothers of Milwaukee. The Bitter Root, tunnel and approaches for two and one-half miles on each side, are being built by Nelson Bennett of Tacoma, Wash. The line between the Bitter Roots and the coast is under contract to H. C. "Henry of Seattle. All steel bridges and trestles will be erected by the bridge department of the railroad company. Grading is completed and track laid from Glenham to a point about twenty miles west of the Missouri river, the crossing being made upon a temporary pile, bridge. Much grading has been done in the Yellowstone and Mussel shell valleys, and subcontracts have been let and forces are at work upon the balance of the line. To Reach Butte by 1908. It is expected that the construction will be completed to Butte by Jan. 1, 1908, and to the coast a year later. On the east end ^he Missouri river bridge at Glenham will consist of three spans of 425 feet each, with steel trestle A

The grade of the track will be about sixty feet above high water. The piers will be of concrete. faced with granite, and the excavation for the foundations will be made by pneumatic process. Seven and one-half million pounds of steel will be required super structure of this bridge, and the con tract haas been let to the Pennsylvania Steele1 company. The erection thereof constructioforofthe tn 1 as.,w the piers will be done by the road. The first eighty miles west of the Missouri river is entirely within the "tiding Rock Indian reservation. Within the past six months the govern ment land wesk of the Indian reserva tion has been rapidly taken up, and settlers are moving on in large num bers. The country is a rolling prairie an excepting one canvon at the head of Hay creek and the valley of the Little Missouri river on the east side aitords no engineering difficulties. Four miles east of Terrv, Mont, there will be an overhead crossing' of the ^Northern Pacific. The first crossing of the river will be about five miles west of Terry, the second about eleven miles east of Miles City, and the third about six miles west of Miles City. Each of these bridges will consist of four spans with a total length of 1,100 feet. The line passes thru Miles City, and it is probable that division termi nals will be established there. HOW SHAW WOULD AYEBT ALLPANIGS He Proposes that the Secretary Be Given $100,000,000 Anti Panic Fund. Journal Special Service. Washington, Dec. 8.Secretary Shaw does not understand why there should be any question as to the feasibility of averting panics if the secretary of" the treasury should-fee given $100,000,000 to deposit in banks "or withdraw from circulation, as he deems fit. To the secretary of the treasury the plan he outlines is self-explanatory. His idea is that whenever money was scarce he would let out enough of his $100,- 000,000 fund to relieve the stringency. If the money was needed in New "Ik)rk it would be sent there. If it was need ed in London, Mr. Shaw would deposit, say $50,000,000 in New York, with the understanding that half of th9 amount was to be sent abroad to ease the strain there. Anything approaching panic condi tions in London, Mr. Shaw contends, is quickly reflected in New York finan cial circles. VICIOUS NEGRO KILLS SEVEEAL.

"At the recent monthly meeting of the Pacific Coast Lumber Manufactur ers' association held week before last at Seattle, a fund was provided to pay the expenses of the suit, on the recom mendation of the chairman of the com mittee appointed at a previous meet ing to devise ways and means for se curing relief. The first work will be the gathering of evidence, enough of which has already been secured to con vince the committee that the railroads can be compelled to furnish more equip ment. Statistics were quoted showing that the average movement of freight cars last year was only sixty-one miles a day. The chairman also stated' that there were undoubtedly some mill men who did not caCre to ally themselves with the movement for fear the rail roads would take it out on them, but making it an association affair put them all in the same boat, and the roads would hardly dare pursue such a policy affecting all the members.of the association, even if they were so dis posed. The shingle mills bureau has joined hands with the lumber associa tion, and it is proposed to carry the matter to a finish.'' 

SLAYER IS SENTENCED Emil Olson, Who Killed Doree, Must Serve 5V2 Years in Penitentiary. Emil Olson must serve five and one half years in the Minnesota state pris on for killing Albert Doree on the night of July 4. Olson, who had been con victed of manslaughter in the first de gree, was sentenced by Judge Simpson shortly after noon today.

Hazelhurst, Miss., Dec. 8.The prose cution in the case of Mrs. Angie Bird song, charged with the murder of Dr. Thomas ButleV, completed its evidence yesterday. The prosecution attempted to show that the youthful defendant's act was deliberate and that she followed her already mortally wdunded victim Out of his office to his veranda where she adjusted her revolver, after he had pleaded for mercy, and fired three more shots at him. The defense immediately called as its first witness the defendant's mother-in-law, Mrs. S. F. Birdsong/ The latter testified that the defendant, af ter the birth of her last child, had shown signs of insanity and that these symptoms were repeated-about the time of the killing.^ 5 igo6. RAILROAD FOOLS OHDER THE I. C. C. Plan to Let Roads Combine Under Commission's Supervision Is Proposed. By W. W. Jermane, Colorado Building, Washington, D. C. Washington, Dec. 8.Congressman Townsend of Michigan came before the interstate commerce commission today for a consultation on the practicabil ity and feasibility of legislation per mitting railroads to pool under the supervision of a commission. I is thought that perhaps the question of thru rates may be made more simple and effective for all concerned if rail roads can be permitted to form such combinations as meet the approval of the commisison, the idea being that if this can be done, rates, can be Held stable on a reasonable basis and wi,th out favor for any one shipper over any other./ Compulsory Arbitration. The question of a compulsory arbitra tion law is also being discussed at the meeting. The hearings on the Townsend bill providing for such arbitration com mence before the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce next Friday, and. invitations are being sent tq_ employers of labor and leaders of labor organizations in all parts of the country to attend and give the commit tee benefit of their advice* The interstate commerce commission will also be asked to suggest names of people who ought to be invited and the commissioner of labor likewiseemployern has bee consulted on this point. Mr. Townsend expects.the on the* bill will etty livelyshearings aasn he finds there are mane ?Ti. ma^"v als er of. labor whp will oppose the" proposed law. It is thought, *herefqre. highly important that hearings be as free and full as may be, with opportunity for all who are concerned to be heard. Minnesota manufacturers, employers and labor men generally are to be in vited as fast as the invitations can be prepared and mailed, but it is the hope of the committee that all will consider themselves invited whether the commit tee gets around to them with a formal invitation, or not.

OLD PLAN TO GET A RED HAT FOR IRELAND Journal Speeial Service. Chicago, Dec. 8.John Callan O Loughlm in a Washington special to the Chicago Tribune says: An extra ordinary letter has been addressed by Bellamy Storer to President Eooftevelt and the members of his cabinet in re gard to Mr. Storer's dismissal from the post of ambassador of the United States to Austria-Hungary. Mr. Storer was dismissed because of his wife's ''interference" in affairs of the Roman Catholic church and her al leged misuse of letters from the presi dent. It was also charged that Mrs. Storer had meddled with French poli tics by taking part in an anti-republi can intrigue to promote the marriage of victor Bonaparte with a member of the Orleanist family. Both of these charges Mr. Storer em- Ehatically denies, and, on the other and, he declares that the president's interest in the selection of Archbishop Ireland as a cardinal was not due to him or to his wife, but to the president himself. Mr. Storer's side of the case includes letters exchanged by the president and Mr. and Mrs. Storer, in which the for mer addressed Mr. and Mrs. Storer re spectively "My Dear Bellamy" and ''My Dear Maria," and Mr. and Mrs. Storer addressed the president as'' Dear Theodore." Storer's Removal. Mr. Storer begins the letter by ex plaining that on March 20 last lie re ceived a cablegram from the state de Eartment saying,he was removed from is office as ambassador of the United States to Austria-Hungary. This, cable ram was received by him while ill in Igypt on leave of absence and disclosed no reason. Mr. Storer wrote for an exr planation and received a reply written by Assistant Secretaryv.of -State Bacon, by direction,.as he stated, of the pf'esi idfiiitj oJthe^effeCt .tjiat. he was removed because he had failed to answer two letters and a telegram sent to him by the president. cell1 mav'premise,' says Mr. Storer, that both Mrs. Storer and I were on terms of close, and, as we believed, af fectionate, personal intimacy with Mr. Roosevelt, and for more than ten years have been in the habit of exchanging with h|m, frequently letters written on both sides with the greatest unreserve on both private and public matters. Without this explanation the situation cannot be understood. Letters Belated to Church. "The letters which I am charged with improperly leavingrefunanswered," continues Mr. Storer,

"Long before my appointment" to Brussels, Archbishop Ireland had been a. friend of mine, anl also of .Mr. Roosevelt's, who often expressed to me his great admiration of him and his sympathy with the archbishop's ef forts to act in his ecclesiastical office so as to meet the highest demands of American citizenship. "The possibility that the archbishop might be made a cardinal greatly in terested me and his appointment seemed to me to promise great benefit, both to the church and to our country at home, especially in the Philippines. Mr. Roosevelt held the same opinion and strongly desired the appointment." Urges Effort for Ireland. Mr. Storer states in March, 1899, he wrote and cabled to Mr. Roosevelt, then governor of New York, about promoting the appointment of the'arch bishop by such means as would make known at Rome t^e high opinion held of the prelate in America, and Mr. Roosevelt exerted himself to that end and applied to President McKinley to 'use his influence also. On March 23 of that year Mr. Roosevelt wrote Mr. Storer a letter addressed: "My Dear Bellamy," stat ing that he had written to the presi dent and had also submitted 4o him the cables he had received. I absolutely agree with you as to Archbishop Ireland," said the then governor of New York. "You know the truth about this so-called' recanta tion of his about Americanism much better than I do.

The bishop carried out the president's wish. Mr. Storer also quotes Judge Taft to justify his statement that Arch bishop Ireland's appointment to the office of cardinal was definitely desired by the government. In the_ autumn of 1900 Mr. Storer had a private audience with Pope Leo

After Mr. Roosevelt had suoceeded to the presidency he returned to the sub ject of publicity and the possibility of there being letters of his in the possession of other persons and wrote a letter dated the White House, Wash ington, Jan. 16, 1902, and addressed it "Dear Bellamy," in which the follow ing statement appears: "Wiill you ask Maria again if there is any letter of mine, to her or a copy of any letter which, so far as she fs aware, is in the hands of anyone else? It is stated with the utmost insistence that Rampolla has one.
