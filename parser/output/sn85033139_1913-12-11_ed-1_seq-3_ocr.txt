Va.. l>ec. 9 —One hundred and ninety-eeven passengers were ta ken off the steamer Rio Grande at. sea before breakfast Sunday while the big ship was on fire and thought to be iu danger. The rescue was made by the British steamship Swanmore. bound from Liverpool to Baltimore. The rescue occurred 205 miles north west of Diamond Shoals. The Rio Grande, after Us crew failed to sub due the flames in one of its forward holds, sent out wireless calls for as sistance. The Swanmore, which was within a few miles of the burning ship, picked them up and hurried to the burning vessel. It reached the Rio Grande shortly after four o’cloca and sent life boa s to take off the passengers. A high southwest wind caused a choppy sea and there was danger of the life boats being crushed against the sides of the two steamers. The Rio Grande was ready to trans fer the passengers when the Swan more hove In sight and had its life boats loaded with human freight while hanging in their davits. The rescue, accomplished in dark ness, is regarded here as the most thrilling recorded iu some time. The excellent discipline of the crew of both vessels is believed to be respon sible for the successful transfer of the passengers from the burning vessel to the Swanmore. One report received hern said that the Swanmore after taking off the Rio Grande's passengers stood by the ship and helped to fight the Haines. When tlte fire was under control, one report says, the passengers were again trans ferred to the Rio Grande. DYNAMITE PLOTS REVEALED. „f G. E. Davis Makes Confession in New York.
