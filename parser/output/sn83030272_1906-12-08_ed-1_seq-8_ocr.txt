ROOSEVELT seems to havebeen been misinformed as regards certain ofthe r the more or leA important details of thocrisis crisis in Cuba At least it would seemno no in view of the following utterance inhis his messageThe The readiness and efficiency of both the armyand and navy In dealing with the recent Hudden crisisIn In Cubs Illustrate afresh their value to the nationThis This resdlnens and efficiency would have beenvery very much less bad It not been for the dIstance ofthe the General Staff In the army and the GeneralBoard Board In the navy both arc essential to the properdevelopment development and use of our military forces afloatand and ubore The troops that were sent to Cubawere I were handled flawlesslyOf Of course there is nothing to be saidby by way of criticism in connection withthe the navy The conduct of that branchof of tho service was in all respects ua MrROOSEVELT ROOSEVELT aptly describes it flawlessOur Our ships appeared upon the sceneexactly exactly at the critical moment Weare are not sure however that flawlessapplies applies at all points to the annyH partin in the affair for it seems to bo prettygenerally generally believed that the transportSumncr Sumner did not sail on time not by aweek 1 week nt least nnd that even then sheleft I left behind a very considerable proportion tion of the comn is ury utoes whichaccording Iacrding according t programme who had beencspectcd cspectcd to take There seems littledoubt doubt that the army authorities in chargeof of the Sumner found it necessary enreaching reaching Havana to borrow very freelyfrom from the naval authorities there inrespect i respect of meat and other supplies indispensable pensable to the military rationWe We can seo that it would be unfair torhargp rhargp this contntmpa to the GeneralKtafT Stall of the army which tho Presidentlauds lauds in terms of enthusiasm WithGeneral General J FIUNKLIN BELL in Cuba andwith with Mr ROOSEVELT temporarily abI I i L sorbed

the thought thatwo we purpose to condemn even the mostinsignificant insignificant manifestation of error orfutility futility We yield to none in eagernessand and confidence when it comes to assertingthat that the incident would have been flawless loss Indeed had tho President himselfor or his accomplished subordinate thechief chief of the General Staff been free togivo givo undivided personal attention t the expedition But this is a matterof of fact and not of halcyon speculationwherefore wherefore we venture t suggest thatthe the crisis in Cuba 8 far a concernsthe the armys part in that now memorabledrama drama was enacted with somethingless enat ometngI0S less than lawlessness Had not thonaval naval atoreships been on hand to remedythe the Sumners deficiencies our troopswould would have found themselves on painfully fully short commonsWe We are fa from sure in fact thattho tho Shatter expedItion of 1893 organizedand and despatched in great haste and undercircumstances circumstances of bewildering confusionwas was not better equipped and more completely pletely eelffiusUining I a essentialrespects respects than the military expeditionof of SumnerThe a few weeks ago represented by thoSumner The Santo Domingo TreatyWhile While the original Santo Domingotreaty treaty ha not yet been definitely wit drawn it f generally understood thatits its case is practically and thata It ce I prcicly hopeless ad tta a new draft will b substituted I Isbelieved believed that a treaty can now b drawnIn In a form avoiding the assumption ofcertain certain responsibilities which were re garded a objectionable in the earlierconvention conventionUnder conventonUnder Under the terms of the treaty submitted mitted on February 151005 the Unit States agreed to the adjustment Stt ag attempt te ajURtment ment of all the obligations of the Dominican loan Government foreign a well a domestic the adjustment of the payment ment and the conditions of amortizationthe amortztonthe the consideration of conflicting and u reasonable claims and the determinationof of the validity and amount of all pondingclaims claims The objections to the enterprise prise and to the necessary steps forits its execution were many and seriousWlille While the open opposition came fromthe the Democratic side it was no secretthat that a considerable degree of Republicansupport support was for a number of reasonssomewhat somewhat less than halfheartedThe The possible and perhaps probablesubstitution substitution of a new treaty is the resultof of efforts made by agents of the Dominica Iicon icon Government t clear the situationthrough through a refunding of tho debts of theisland island I is said that conditional arrangements rangements havo been made with thocreditors creditors for a settlement of all claimson on a basis which will scale the debts ofthe the island to an average of about sixtycents i cents on the dollar and for their acceptance ance of a new bond issue in place of thovarious various outstanding bonds and unliquidated dated claims It is also said that similar liar conditional arrangements have beonmade I made for the financing of the new bondissue issueWhile While there would doubtless still remain main in many minds a question of thewisdom wisdom of concerning ourselves so actively tively in the financial affairs of our neighbors hors the mot serious objections wouldbe b removed by the projected schemeThe The United States would still continueto t act as a depositary for I portion of thecustoms customs revenues of the island Properrestrictions restrictions and safeguards could b provided by treaty agreement and thewhole whole matter reduced t a mere routineproceeding proceeding The alternative of our i terference would probably be serious disorder order in the island and possibly srouscomplcton jcomplications complications with Erop j The projected arrangement i i big improvement provement over the original plan and I i can be carried out there i every probability ability that a treaty providing for itwould would be approved by a safe majorityA jA A Crying Need of National
