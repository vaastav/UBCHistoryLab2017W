Poor and Weak Catarrh and Bronchial Trouble Had no Appetite Now Better in Every Way A Delicate Child. "Some time since I took a sadden cold and could not get rid of it. Being subject to catarrh and bronchial trou ble I coughed terribly. I lost my appetite and grew poor and weak and I did not feel like work. I began taking Hood's Sarsapa rilla. In a short time the cough disap peared, I slept well, had a good appetite and I was better in every way. Last spring I was not feeling well, I had no ap petite and no strength. I resorted to Hood's Sarsaparilla and soon felt more like work.

CLEAR OX CUBA The row among the Kentucky belles ! about christening the new battleship "Kentucky" seems to have arisen from a promise by ex-Secretary of the Navy Herbert to Miss Richardson that she should smash the bottle of champaign on that cocasion. Under the trying circumstances in which he was placed however, he might have been justified in agreeing to furnish her a pair of wings whereby sue suouia nit at win among the angels; she had just pre sented him with a bottle of genuine Kentucky sour mash, forty-five years old. It is not very clearthnt the supposed murder in College Tlace night before last was a murderat all. The presum able murderer is a character so vague and indefinite that pursuit of him is like pursuing a shadow. That the wound is not large and that there was no powder stains is very light evi deuce that the wound was not self in flicted; that the victim did not know what he was talking about is indicat ed and is not surprising; a mau with a bullet in his brain could scarcely be expected to be a credible wituess. There is a bare possibility that it was murder. The number of ideas expressed on the President's message is bewildering till vou sum them all up and strike an average when you conclude that most ly the ideas on that document are vague and uncertain. President McKinley sets forth in clear language the reasons why any ecoguition of the ln-lligerent rights of Cuba should not now be accorded. Ou this point the country will, we think. igree with him, as also upon the wise and conservative policy which he out- ines in according to Spain ample time to demonstrate the excellence of her eforms. Especially will his view be ccepted when he asserts that if in the fuf.irea righteous peace.justaliketothe Cubans and Spa in, as well as equitable to all our interests, cannot be attained the exigency of further and other ac- iou by the United States will remain to be taken.

Heretofore a neces sarily limited course of metaphysics has been provided for in all our great universities but till now there has been no college entirely devoted to that great subject. At present the course of study includes philosophy, symbol- ogy, ethics, nietaphysico physiology, curative seience.metaphysical healing. The terms for courses of instruction are high, ranging from i?125 to l?3O0. The school is really the outgrowth of the modern theosoihy. Christain sci ence and the kindred isms and diver gent and convergent ideas. If this school would take up the rational study of the human mind accounting for its conceptions and misconceptions, its tendency to pursue imaginary "strange gods" and its failure to se cure the diliiiite which it often asserts it has within its grasp it would ac complish a great work in the direction ot metaphysics.

An eastern exchange printed in New York tells the remarkable story of a negro near Pittsburg being struck uy wo trains of cars and receiving no worse injury than a broken arm. The wo trains were going in opposite di rections on parallel tracks between which he was walking. As he found himself about to be passed by the trains t nearly the same time he stampeded nd attempted to spring across the track in front of one which bounced im oft" the cowcatcher into the air in front of the other train which caught him on the front end of the engine and threw him between the trains.

According to the reports, the democrat ic party has been sold by its leaders in Congress to the sugar trust, which all the world knows is williugto spend an enormous amount to prevent the an nexation of Hawaii. The sugar trust has agreed to furnish a corruption fund which the democratic leaders believe to lie large enough to enable them to elect a democratic majority of the House next year and a democratic President in !hni. if the democratic leaders can succeed in preventing the annexation of Hawaii, either through the ratification of the treaty or by direct legislation.' That Is why the democratic Senators, with two excep tions, are all working against the rat ification of the treaty, and why the democrats of thellouse will this week, in caucus, declare against annexation. But this disgraceful deal cannot be carried out. because the democrats cannot prevent the annexation of Hawaii. Immigration to the United States for the year ending with last June, ac cording to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury showes a decrease of 112,435 on the previous fiscal year, a matter that is highly encouraging to the laborers and citizens of this coun try.

The Board should specify distinctly what it wants printers to bid on. This is perhaps the first session of Congress ever held since the govern ment began business at the present stand that a drink of liquor could not be bought in theCapitol of the nation.

HERALD is in receipt of the an nual report of Captain Pratt, superin tendent of the Carlisle (Pa.) Indian school. He has pupils from sixty-eight tribes amounting to a total of 702. The school is conducted along the lines of the Indian school near this city which is under the management of Col. Mo-Cowan. The message ends with the signifi cant sentence that "it is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations with in the receipts of the government and thus avoid a deficit." This is the real secret of the "deficit" not insufficient revenues but excessive appropriations. And it is by restraining the expenses of the government within the limit of probable revenues, instead of reaching out over land and sea for new fields of expenditure, that the deficit is to le avoided. The President has thus giv en to the Congress, on all domestic af fairs at least, a good chart by which to steer. Phil. Times. The withdrawal of the petition ask ing for a receiver for the Arizona Can al and the Arizona Improvement Co. by the Merchants Loan & Trust Co.

In actual practice it lias taken a book-keeper two years to become sufficiently acquainted with the com plicated business to make him a coin petent man for the position. which in dicates in a small way the importance of the great business that has been en trusted to Mr. Hall's management. It is to be hoped that lie will be entirely successful in handling it to the satis faction of all concerned. Christmas Is ComiD& !

Justice Johnstone is doing a good work for the, county in refusing to give a standing in his court to the numerous little personal spite cases that come to it and which should nev er find a place in any court.

No one can question that there is to be a vigorous onslaught on the civil service reformers after Geuerai Gros veuor's keynote speech on the lloor of the House the other day. He did not mince words in handling the subject. As to the paragraph in the President's message concerning the service, the General said: "I am comiclled to dif fer with the President when he says that 'the system has the approval of the people.' I have tried with great fidelity too keep in touch with the toue and sentiment of the people of this country, and I believe that if you will cross the Allegheny Mountains and submit the question of the civil service law and regulations as now adminis tered "Yes" and the same proposition "No" that 15 out of every loo would vote against it. I know that it is said that the Republican who differs with this bureau is running a tilt against the Republican party; but I caution gentlemen that since the extension of the civil service rules and operations by the edict of Grover Cleveland the First, after the people of this country had ordered him out of office, there has been no Republican declaration in fav or of the upholding of the system. The great State that I have the honor to be a resident of has denounced it in the bitterest kind of language in the resolutions adopted at their Toledo convention. So. to. with all the oilier States whose platforms 1 have read that were enacted in the year 1SU7; and so, to. by nearly a hundred thous and, the popular vote of Maryland de nounced the whole scheme. All hail Maryland. Advance column of the people.' President McKinley's utterances on the currency question, in his message which has just been presented to Con gress, are clear, concise and simple so plain that every citizen may under- and them, yet so complete on their scope that they meet all present re quirements ot what is looked uqon as an extremely complicated situation The greenbacks which are outstand ing are redeemable in gold, and Con gress, by its declaration that it wa me estaiiiisneu policy ot tlie govern ment to maintain all of its obligation on an equality with gold, placed the Treasury notes, issued under what is popularly -known as the Sherman Act in practically the same category. It is iK'cause of the fact that the Treasury notes especially, and the United States notes also, under certain circumstanc es, are redeemed in gold when gold i: demanded for them, that it has been possible for those desiring gold to ob tain it from the Treasury by a presen ration of those notes. The fact that the i reasury is compelled under the law as it now exists to pay those notes out again in current business make: them what is known as the "endles: chain"' since they may again and again be presented in this manner and ihu me goia pumpeti out ot tne treasury as long as it exists. The President recommends that when any of th Lnited States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold, those notes shall be kept and set apart and not paid out again unless in exchange for gold. By this simple process of retaining in a separate fund every note of the United States which the Government is required to redeem in gold, the "endless chain" ceases to be endless. While the objectors may urge against this a statement that the retention of these notes instead of per mitting them to go back into circula tion, would in time reduce to a certain extent the circulating medium, this objection is met by the simple method by which national banks may increase their circulation in case of need for additional circulating medium. The President's recommendation in this San Francisco. Dec. It!.--The steam ship Doric.which arrived from Japan this morning, brought the following interesting news bearing upon the Jap an. Hawaiian controversy: "His chances of becoming Minister of State having disappeared with the unsuc cessful termination of negotiations be tween the government and the radi cais. .ur. iiosliy lctt tor his post at W ashington by the City of Peking. It is reported that as the Cabinet found that the absolute protest against the Hawaiian annexation was of no avail it concluded that it would be advis able to yield a point and while not ob jectmg to annexation to make an ef fort to ensure the protection of Jap anese interests.

This.it is believed, would make the issuance of currency a suffi cient object to national banks to pro vide an increase at least equal to the reduction resulting from the retention of the United States notes redeemed in gold, and also render the bank-note system sufficiently flexible to supply any additional sums required by finan cial emergencies, while the proposition that national banks may be establish ed with aminimum capital of ;?2o.mi0 would distribute these banks more thoroughly amongthe smaller villiages and agricultural communities. While tlie President's recommendations do not go to the extent of those of his Secretary of the Treasury in regard to the absolute retirement of these obli gations, they do provide, by an ex tremely simple process which would not at all disturb financial affairs, or appear likely to awaken serious hos tilities, for a prevention of the recur rence of the troubles and dangers of the past two or three years, which have not only endangered the curren cy system of the country, but have ac tually compelled the creation of interest-bearing indebtedness to protect it. to the front.

Before the bill proper was taken up semi-political questions were asked by Mr. Hill, republican of Con necticut, who called Mr. Gage's atteu tiou to the statement yesterday that the first purixiseof the bill was to com- nit the country to the gold standard "ion are recognizedas a republican" said Mr. Hill addressing the Secretary. and you are familiar with the finau cial platform of the republican con vention at St. Louis: do you consider that this purpose of more firmly fixing the gold standard on t.ie country con tlicts with the plank of the St. Louis platform on finance?'' No sir" responded Mr. Gage. "Not as I look attfieouestionot bimetallism. l.iinetallism must mean one ot two things, either it is two kinds of monev of unequal value, circulating side by ide by reason ot the exchange of the less valuable for that of greater value, or else two kinds of money or such intrinsic equality that thev will circulate naturally side by side. We have a bimetallic currency in the United States now. A firm establish ment of the gold standard, with such Intel-changeability with silver as will make it acceptable on an equality with gold, will maintain this bimetal lism."' The Secretary went on to state that this iu no way prejudiced any steps that might be taken to bring silver up to a higher standard ot value. The bill, however, was designed to give u ch confidence in the financial abili ty of the government, that the discrim inations against silver would largely decrease. Mr. Cox, democrat, of Tennessee, asked if the result of the Gage bill eventually would not lead to one kind of papermoney-bank notes and no silver except subsidiary silver. "There is nothing in this plan to co-oi-erate to that extent now." answered Mr. Gage. "It is iu that directiou.and with further expansion and develop ment, it might eventually lead such a result.""

Sin Fr ncisao reports, the wheat crop improved by recent rains, vith conservative estimates pointing to a yield of 875,000 tons. Gsneral export trade on the coast is very heavy. Tbe price situation is oae of soetaio id and even pggreaaive etiength. The index number ot ninety-eight leading staples showed a peroaptib'.e inorease daring the month of November and ft further improvement ia indicated this week. Wheat is higher, partly on im proved statistical position, bat largely io sympathy with the Chioage ''eqaeie" avhich has advanced prioes loo. per bashel in that market within a week. All other oersata have sympathized with wheat--, and coffee, oipper, cotton, dairy products, leaf tobsoo) and raw soger are also among the prominent staples which have been enhaooed la value. Toe decreases have been few and slight, pi iron being most prominent, swing to a slight shading in P.ttabang, with sympathetic weiknesa at other points on an immense produotioo. Talk of a pool to control production has stiffened prioes of wire and nails. Steadiness has been a feature of the price of pork, lard and wool. The railroad interests ot tbe oountry are etj jyicg prosperous times. J? oi too month of November they show tbe heaviest gain ia amount and percentage reported ia any month for years ptst. Liirge increases are a feature, and the tendency toward gains is almost un varying.

The Pacific and southwestern roads have doae relatively best, with gains of. respectively, 40 and 30 per cent; bat the grangers and osatral-westerc 'roads re port increases in excess of 25 per cent. The total earnings of 101 railroads for elevn months this year aggregate over i56,000,000, so iocreaee over last year of 6 per oeat., fnlowinj a gain last veer on laid id? roida ot 2 per cent, ever 1S95. The Paoirio roads make the best ehowicg for the eleven-months' period with a gain of 12 per cent, while the coal roads report the smallest inorease, only fib :n t 2 per cent. Bank clearings are again very heavy, . . the total at 77 oiMes for the past week aggregating $1,353,000,000, a gain of 2 per cent over last week, ot 25 per cest over the W9ek a year ago, of 32.6 per oent ov. r 1891, and ot 21 per cent over 1S03. Compared with the year 1S92. when clsiricgs approsobed tbe maxi mom of recent years, the decrease is only C 7 per o nt. When compared with 1331 the iao.-ease is only 11.4 per C3nt. Stock-market values at New York hava advacced dariog the week with iacreaeicg pablio intsrest io speoalation though profs sioartl manipulative in-Huenoi-s have been very apparent. Among tbe oarreat balHso feotors the President's treataaant ot the Cuban question, the increase in railroad earn ings, romors of dividends 00 s number of e took a nod. above all, the activity and strength of the bond market have been coDepicuoos. Trading in ?bonds has been oa a very large so ale, the; buying demand caused by the superabundance of idle fends and the approach of the January interest disbursements havicg turned large'y to the bonds of reorgan ized railroads. Northern Pacific ad vanced on vhe expectation of the divi dend on the preferred stock. Uolon Pacific eeoarities were affected by the . postponement ot tbe Kansas Paoifio sale.
