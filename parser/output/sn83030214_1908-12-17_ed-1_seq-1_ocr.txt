SUGAR BUUXCt CHANG ED DECISION IN ACTION FOR 900,000 REVERSED Perm. Refining Company Ha* ( av.se Against American Refining ( Court of Appeals Holds. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals In an opinion written by Judge Noyes, reversed yesterday the decision of the Circuit Court dis missing -the complaint of the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company against the American Sugar Refining Company, in which damages of $30,000,000 are asked. Judge Noyes hold:? that the lower court was wrong in ruling thit in terstate commerce was not involved, and that the suit was wrongly brought under the Sher man law. The allegation was that the American suear Refining Company had induced Adclph Segal, of Philadelphia, who owned a controlling inter es*. in an indirect way, in the Pennsylvania company, to accept a considerable loan, and that, when he had accepted this loan ar.d as signed his interest in the Pennsylvania com pany, which carried with it a voting power, the American Sugar Refining Company had had new directors elected for the Pennsylvania company and had, through them, compelled the closing of its new sugar ■■ try. This refinery is in Shakamaxon street, Phil adelphia, and the papers in the suit declare that ■• has been kept idle as a result of trie al leged conspiracy since December, lIKKJ. The plant has a capacity of Tour thousand barrels a day, and the damage at the time of the bring ing of the suit was set at $10,000,000 Dam ages to the amount of three times this sum are asked. Judge Holt dismissed the complaint last April." on the ground that the Pennsylvania company had shown no cause for action under the Sherman law. It was also alleged by the defendant that the plaintiff was not In busi ness at the time the suit was brought, and was therefore not In a position to bring such ac tion. Judge Noyes holds that the plaintiff should have the opportunity to prove that it could have continued In business had it not been restrained by the alleged conspiracy. Judge Noyes, In his opinion, says that while an agreement or combination for the elimina tion of competition may not operate in restraint •■f trade from the • economic point of view, it must necessarily be in restraint of trade from the legal point of view, aa the law regards com petition as the life of trade. The point at is sue is whether or nut the agreement or contract operates in restraint of state or interstate trade. He holds that in this cas» such restraint Qt Interstate trade may be proved. Judge Holt's opinion was based on the case of the United States asrt. E. C. Knight & Co.. which bears, says Judge Noyes. a ftrong superficial resemblance to the present case. Judge Noyes says, however, that in the older case the restraint was of manufacture, relat ing only indirectly to interstate trade, wr.ile in the present case there is direct effect on inter state commerce. Continuing the opinion. Judge Noyes says: It must be cl»ar!y borne in mind that tra de fendants in this case are not charged -Impiv with preventing the plaintiff frTn engaging; in a manufacturing business. If they were the Knight decision would undoubtedly be applica ble. They are expressly charged also with pre venting the plaintiff from en(?:it*lng in interstate eomxnerci — with preventing the importation of rn'v materials and the exportation of the nunu fafturpd product. In fact, the allegation.* rd 90 far .is to charge a conspiracy to prevent the in terstate transportation of materials and prod- Coniinued on aetrend pa go.

The A-t'.r.g President of Venezuela RISE AGAINST CASTRO CARACAS MOB BURNS THE PRESIDENT'S EFFIGIES. His Friends' Property and Office of His Organ Pillaged — His Rule Probably Over. Caracas, Venezuela, Dec. 14 (via WHlemstad. Curasao, Dec. 16 V — The people of Caracas arose to-day against President Castro. An infuriated mob, unhindered by the police, swept through the city wrecking the property of Castro's henchmen and closest friends. The crowd rounded up all the statues and pictures of Pres ident Castro from the clubs and other semi public buildings, and burned them with rejoicing on the Plaza Bolivar. Castro's rule in Venezuela is probably ended. In spite of Holland's warlike activity on the coast, thtre have been no demonstrations against the Netherlands; they have ail been directed against President Castro and ting President Gomez. Further demonstrations are expected. No official act deposing Castro from the Presi dency of Venezuela yet has been taken, but such a Step is expected at any moment. An enormous crowd of the inhabitants, of the capital, swelled by people from the outlying country, gathered in the streets soon after day break. The people began marching up and down the main thoroughfares, and it was easy to see that their ll] temper would poon result In vio lence. The police stood by and made no attempt whatever to restrain the mob. The first building to be attacked and looted was that of the lottery monopoly. The offices of the state enterprise that has enriched itself at the expense of the people were ransacked and pillaged. Furniture was broken and thrown to the streets, and thousands of lottery tickets were destroyed. The crowd then moved to the printing office of "El Constitutional." the organ of President Castro, of which Gumerslndo Rlvas is editor, and pillaged it completely A steam laundry be longing to Riva= also was wrecked. The mob turned ita attention next to sex-eral drug stores belonging to Befior Thielen, a son in-law of Genera] Tello Mendoza. and turned them inside out. General Mendoza was at one time Minister of Finance and Public Credit under Castro. He was also the President's pri vate secretary' for a number of years, an.i has been regarded as one of his stanchest support ers. He is universally hated by the enemies of Castro, and his unpopularity and his close com panionship with the President accounted for the acts of the populace against the property of his son-in-law. The statues and pictures of President Castro were made into a huge bonfire on the Plaza Bolivar. The crowd cheered as the flames com pleted the ■ action of these effigies of the dictator. Caracas has been ornamented with a number of public inscriptions Batting forth the virtues of Castro and extolling his powers. These legends next attracted the attention of the mob. and every inscription bearing Castro's name was hacked out and erased. Some of these legends were carved on the public buildings of the city. It was after 1 o'clock by the time the crowd had got thus far In Its depredations. It lacked leadership, and paused In default of other fields for its destructive energies. It was then that a detachment of troops was called out for duty on the city streets, and Acting president Gomez issued a manifesto prohibiting further destruc tion These measures had the desired end, for the mob quieted down and then dispersed.

NEW OPERA HOUSE HINT. Hammerstein Said To Be Planning Uptorcn Theatre. A third permanent Institution for the produc tion of grand opera In New York appeared pos sible in the intimation that car Hammer stein is seriously considering the establishment of a new lyric theatre in the district west cf Central Park. The notion is said to have hov ered for several months under Mr. Hammer stein's tile, but with the success of the Phila delphia Opera House, to say nothing of that of the Manhattan, it was learned yesterday that Mr. Hammerstein was contemplating the building of a theatre in the uptown residence district which will be more convenient to many of his patrons. In this move on the part of Mr. Hammerstein pome persons well known in the theatrical world are inclined to see a determination on the part of the West H4th street impresario to get into the game and to establish a rivalry to the New Theatre, the cornerstone of which was laid on Tuesday. Practically the same group of men as control the Metropolitan Opera House are associated with the New Theatre, and Mr. Hammerstein's experience in opera giv ing against a strong rivalry is said to be the spur to his new move.

REVISE THE TARIFF, SAYS JUDGE TAFT REASONABLE PROFIT OS INVESTED CAPITALS For Modification of Sherman Law in Regard to Railroads. He Tells Ghzoaws at Dinner.

Pr<?sid«nt-»lect. It was. really, almost a Taft family affair, slr.ee Hesry W. happens to be president of the society, and Charles P. sat beside the Ne-v York State Ex ecutive. While the Ohioans were fe«-lir.g proud and happy to have their distinguished fellow citi zen with them, they Tfire net too fond of their native state to forget interest in the state of their adoption; and when Henry W. Taft. with. his proprietary interest in the 11-rxt President, declared that the country had got the habit of picking its Presidents alternately from Ohio and New York, and went on to predict, talking squareiy to Governor Hughes ar.d mentioning hin> by name, that "the game of Presidential see-saw would continue for an Indefinite period." the entire assemblage cheered and cheered again. This was repeated when ex- Senator Spooner declared that the guests bad had the splendid opportunity to hear the two "star orators of the recent campaign," Judge* Taft and Governor Hughes, In his speech Judge Taft declared strong'.y in. favor of a revision of the tariff, but on princi ples of protection. 'The platform dealgr^ated by the national convention 's the declared pol icy of the party," he said. "There is. therefore. a sacred duty on the President and the leaders in the Senate and House to carry out the pal ley thus declared." He declared that the revision of the tariff was the mofct important plank, in the Republican. platform. Mr. Taft also referred again last night to tlia Sherman anti-trust la.w. ar.d declared for it 3 en forcement as one of the Roosevelt policies that the party had pledged itself to carry forward. MB. 

TAJFTS SPEECH. The sruests stood and cheered for mcr<; than a minute when Mr. Taft arose to speak. Ha> said: I went through a peculiar experience this evening; but one I went through without the real suffering that I expected— that of listening to my brother. I infer from what Spooner sa:d that he is generally taken to be a number cf years older- He Isn't. He's two years younger. To let him. make a speech about his big brother wculdnt have been permitted in earlier days. If it were not a reference to a religious sub ject, which after the election possibly I may b« permitted I should speak of a remark of fan la those days. "My bis? brother Bill says there ain't going to be no hell." lam going- to talk a little politics to-night. I want to sp*-a'< of the peculiarities as viewed, by other governments that we have in carrying- on our government. Of course, in running a popu lar governr.isnt successfully so as to secure & majority of 15.000.000 voten we must hava parties. So they have in England. But they don't divide the responsibility. The Prime Min ister Is at the same time the executive, the initi ator and the defender of the legislation pro posed. In that respect it is good that he has the responsibility. lam not offering or thiniin^ about a change In our Constitution. Ido not want to be construed that way. lam only tn; tng to point out that with us the President is generally looked to as the head of his party, and he "is generally made responsible for what h ; s party has done or haa failed to do. Tet ta» power is vested in him. in the leaders in tha Senate and in the leaders in the House. In respect to those planks that were lsid dawn in the Republican platform in Chicago, there i 3 the strongest obligation that the many heads o_ > the party should respond and see to it that they have not deceived the people. Now the rr.^<=t important plank and the ens which was fixed by date was the revision of th» tariff which was to be fixed at an extra session as early as possible after March 4. The standard by which that revision was to be governed was that the tariff was to be icilaed on principles Of protection, and these principles cf protection were defined as rates which are to be the meas ure of the difference in cost of production her» and abroad, with a reasonable profit. And that. I take it. means a reasonable interest on capital.; with cost of raw material and labor. Then get, th** difference between such cost her* ar.cj abroad. In this revision we are to make tha' tariff that difference. It means that the committee (TarifD shall, make actual effort themselves to fix that dif- I am a protectionist, but I do not think that: protection make* the possibility for trusts ar.dU monopolies easier than if we didn't have protec tion The way to stamp out monopolies and t'Wtg is not to stamp out the whole protective system. But what that p!atfmm means is. net to fix that difference at an excessive rate ar.d so tempt monopoly to take advantage cf sucix excessive rate. There have been those who believed that it didn't make any difference ho^v high tals rats was. but I think that platform showed them their errors. Unless we do revise in accordance witir this promise, if we only r.akf a surface revision, we shall N» made accountable to the intelligent American people and shall suffer the fata that i« insured to those who deceive them. It is therefore better to have no r-vislan oS the tariff and have the bill fail, unless we rsaks it a real and honest revision. i I want to say a word about th<* Sherman •■--■' • trust act. We stated in our platform that w» proposed to carry out the Roosevelt policy. "Wa propose to do it. and a large portion of ths Roosevelt policy is composed of the Shermaa anti-trust act. We propose to carry out the law or such mod ifications of it as will effect the purposes of those who framed It It should be amended. If possible, to distinguish those combinations not intended to be affected and th^se that were la tcnde<! to b*> affected. It will be th»» business of th'» administration to get such construction or amendment >>* th«* law so as to lay down a rule by which all business men may be guided ia order that they may know where the line Is they must not cross. '» I ar-. not prepared to say Just what amend ments should b» made. A portion of the statute* d»-f.n--s definitely what the railroads may or may not do. This ousht to be modified. <>r repealed. The suggestion that "reasonable 1 should be put in the act. I think, ppeakinsr for myself, will rot be found satisfactory- The term rwtWMbW! in common law with reaped to the restraint of trade has a definite rnennir.^ in some cas«~«. You will put In the hands of J-jdsres the lefria lative function of deciding what 13 reasonabte and what is not reasonable. I think that the Una that will be drawn will be the int»r.t of the com binations in question. If they are mid- to re duce the cost of production they are lefral. but if they ;ire made to monopolise trade, to control markets or to stifie ctnupetition. they are illegal. I live in the hope that the earnest efforts of the administration and t'or.?r^s.; w ii. work out eood results, and that we s»h:«II make such prog ress in the next fonr years that it will be sa!d that we made an honest and earnest effort.
