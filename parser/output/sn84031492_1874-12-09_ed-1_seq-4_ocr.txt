There is one now investigation this winter worth keeping count of. __________ All the gambling-houses in Cincinnati have been closed by the police. The authorities in Chicago would follow this example if they wore vigilant and honest. But they’ro not. One of the signs of tho time is tho trial of a distinguished “Reformer” in Wisconsin, late candidate for Congress, on a charge of attempting to defraud tho United States revenue. Don Carlos 5h said to bo coquetting with gx-Quccu Isabella, with a view to a junction of their forces. Both armies combined—if the Queen can bo said to havo control of an army—could bo whipped out by an organized Government in a fortnight. There is no organized Government in Spain. Bills to reduce tho President’s salary, after (he expiration of Gou. Grant’s term, to $25,000, havo boon introduced in both Houses of Congress. We are pleased with such an exhibition of zeal by Congressmen for tho re d,notion of other people’s salaries. Why not oommonco tho work of retrenchment by cut ting off tbo forward-pay? Politicians who favor an increase of the vtriumo o*f the currency are still proclaiming I hat the President’s message is a “ fire-brand.’ What if it is? It will serve a good purpose h« it touches off Mr. Butler and Mr. Kelley, cud causes their final disappearance in smoko cud ashes. They seem to have got as far as : ho blazing state yesterday. An excellent bill was passed by tho House \ vsterday by unanimous consent. It forbids members of Congress to act as agents or c ounsel for parties to suite under tho revenue laws. Tho spirit in which the bill was re e rived, os much ns its actual passage, is a uiOot encouraging indication of tho good in tentions of tho present Congress. Spooking of weddings—everybody is speak big of weddings in these days—there was one iu Brazil a short time ago which quite eclipsed tho Sharon affair. A report of it is given else where in this paper. Mr. Sharon, and Miss Sharon that was,will not feel like oayiug mean things about Mr. Honoro’s chandeliers after reading tho Brazilian story. If the Republican party has bondholders at its head aud negroes at its tail, and the Democratic party has bondholders at its head and Irishmen at its tail, what is to become of tiie blessed country? Gen. Butler suggests that the only chance of salvation is in tfco es tablishment of a party which shall have thieves at tho head and Communists at tho tail. Another train-robbery ia reported this aiorning. It occurred in Kansas. No vio lence was done to the passengers or mails, but the Wclls-Fargo Express Company was robbed of $30,01)0. Tho people ought to snow that tho State of Missouri shelters the bandits who have committed this and similar outrages, nud that the Democratic State Gov ernment has not tho power or tho will to ar rest and punish them. Mr. Edward M. Lewis, Trustee of the Jay Cooke estate, has presented a report to tho creditors which impliedly charges the bank rupts with fraud. Tho assets have been so much reduced by the payment of preferred claims that scarcely any thing will bo leftf ornn protected creditors. It appears, also, that for many years before their failure Messrs, Jay Cooke Co. were speculating on other peo ple’s money, oud were dividing tho profits among themselves. Ono of tho, bills introduced in Congress yesterday ought to bo, and doubtless will be, closely watched. It proposes to establish tv Government lino of telegraph between Wash ington and Boston, with ofilces at Hartford, Now York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. For purposes of comparison, on experiment of this laud would bo turnout valueless, since it would be made un der tho most favorable conditions, taking tho very richest route in tho whole country; mid it would bo positively unjust to private enter prises to trench in so partial a manner upon their field of operations. The Chicago produce markets were gener ally tamo yesterday, except in provisions, and they were weak. Mess pork was active, and ih'KgtfOo per bvl lower, closing at $19.36® 19.80 cash, and §l9.feotf?ll).9o seller February. Lard was active, and 10f»20o per 100 ibs low er, closing at 812.7.1@12,80 cash, and 5)18.05 for February. Meats were qniot mid easier, at C l-2o for shoulders, 0 1-lc for short libs, cud 9 fi-8c for short clears, llighwlnce were in light demand and steady at 970 per gallon. Dressed hogs were quiet and flrmcr, closing at $7.7 6®(i.2!i per 100 lbs, Flour was dull and auchonged. Wheat was quiet and tf-io lower, dosing at 890 cash, and 89 8-1 o for January, Dorn was quiet with little change, closing at 761-So for old, U7o for new, and 78c seller May. Oats wore quiet aud easier, closing at Hi Wo cash, and/Uo seller January. Uyo was on/-* i'/. - - bade tjiiuer, at 90 t*2(ip94o. Barley was dull (md easier, closing ot $1.20 cash, out! $1.20 for January- On Saturday even ing last there was in store in this city 1,210,- Oil bu wheat, 872,024 bu corn, M 200,100 bu oats, 2*5,-I M bn rye, and 21ir., i:M» bu barley. Hogs wore dull and lu@2oo lower than Sat urday 5 sales at s(j.-lo(ft>7.lQ for good to choice. Cattle wore quiet. Sheep wore ao tlve and firm. • The gentlemen in Washington who aro so loud in their talk about tho currency will gain something in point of propriety and accuracy by using words precisely, Tho word “ bondholder," for instance, does not convey to tho ordinary thinker tho idea which Gut. Butler and Mr. Kelley wish it to express. They should in somo way mnko it clear that when they say “ bondholders " they do not menu the capitalists who fur nished the Government with means of carry ing on tho War of the Rebellion j and, hav ing done this much, they should explain whom they do consider “bondholders," mid tho nature of their offenses. Wo shall then understand Gen. Butler's statement that tho Republican party Ims bondholders at its hood and negroes at its tail. Tho currency question has been precipi tated in the Lower House of Congress much sooner than anybody expected. Mr. Kelley’s convertible-bond; scheme came up in Com mittee of the Whole yesterday, and it wan made tho theme ;of a debate which at times took a wide range. Neither Mr. Kelley nor Mr. Butler, so for os wo con see, touched tho merits of tho bill. They dwelt rather upon the op pressed state of tho poor laboring man and tho enormous iniquities of tho “bondholder,’ 1 and said, with that refreshing impudence which is characteristic of them, that tbo cou vortiblo-bond scheme would furnish a remedy for tho wrongs of tho poor. It was generally understood on tho floor of tho House that both Mr. Kelley and Mr. Butler were at tempting to frighten the Republican mem bers by an exhibition of what they can do on an occasion, and a hint of what they will do, if they are driven to extremities. But tho Republican mem bers didn’t scorcc, Dawes and Garfield met tho attack skillfully and bravely, with a firm ness quite worthy of their best reputations. Kolloy and Butlor will understand, before tbo session is over, that tbo Republican party can do much better without them than they can do without the Republican party. 

EXECUTIVE INTERFERENCE IN THE STATES. That portion of tho President’s message devoted to tho question of Executive interfer ence with tho affairs of tho States is not only remarkably concise and pertinent, but states manlike. His utterances upon this question are so brief, simple, and yet energetic, that no one can mistake their moaning, or doubt that tho President was thoroughly in earnest when ho wrote them. Tho South cannot complain hereafter that thevo is auy ambiguity in tho policy of tho President; and, if Ex ecutive interference becomes necessary, then tho South will have provoked it with 0 full knowledge of the consequences. With regal'd to his general policy, tho Presi dent deprecates interference, and hopes “ that all necessity for Executive direction may become unnecessary aud obsolete,” but at tho same time he wains them that, while ho remains the Executive, "all tho laws of Congress, and tho provisions of the Consti tution, including the amendments added thereto, will be enforced with firmness, but with regret that they should havo added one jot or tittle to Executive duties and powers.” This emphatic announcement of policy is coupled with an earnest moral appeal to the people of the South they would do well to heed. In making this appeal, the President takes high moral ground without reference to party or politics, and addresses himself to both sides in the following •language: Tfl there Dot a dlspoeUiou, on ono sidfl*, lo magnify wrongs aud outrages, aud, on tho other aide, to belit tle them or justify thorn? If publio opinion coulit lo directed to a correct survey of wJiut Is, and to re buking wrong, nml nkllng tbo proper tmiboritioa lu punishing It, h better state of fcollug would bo incul cated. ui)<l tho Rooucr we would have that pence which would leave tho states free indeed to rcguUto their uwd domestic atl'iifr.i, 1 believe, on tbo part of our citizens of tin Southern States,—tbo bettor part of then), —there in u disposition to be law-abiding, and to do du violence cither to individuals or tho hwH exist ing ; but do they do right in ignoring tho osittenco of violence aud bloodshed iu resistance to couedtutcd au thority ? Tho President follows this unselfish and magnanimous appeal with a concise state juent of the cause which has led to Executive interference, namely; “Violence has been rampant in some localities, and Ims farther been justified or denied by those who could have prevented it,” and then states the remedy; “Treat the negro as a citizen and n voter, as he is and must remain, nud soon parlies will bo divided, not on the color line, but on principles. Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interferences. ” Tins statement of the President’s policy should bo carefully studied in the South. Ho has sunk all political considerations, all party prejudices, and addressed himself to the common sense and the conscience of the Southern people. Ho has pointed out. to 1 them the causes which have led to Executive interference in the past, the errors into wliioh they have fallen, and the only method in which they can avoid such interference in the future, and his policy upon this i>oint is founded not only upon the Con* stitutiou and the laws, but upon impartial justice nud humane considerations. If tho South had acted upon such a policy from tho outset, there would have been no occasion for Executive interference. If tho South'hnd appealed to the law instead of overriding it, there would have been order instead of anar chy. If it had recognized tho colored man as a citizen and voter, “as ho is ond must re main,” the Baulk would have been as poacofu as tho North, and there would have been no more occasion for Executive interference in Louisiana or Arkan sas than there has been in Illinois or Ohio.* Tho violence at Vicksburg, reported in our last issue, is a case in point. There was uu informality in the bond of the Sheriff, a col ored man. Tho citizens claimed that ho was acting without legal bond, and tho Board of Supervisors refused to order a new one. Hero was a grievance for which there was a clow hud simple legal remedy. In stead of availin', themselves of this remedy, aa the citizens of any Northern Slate would have done, they band together, with anna in their hands, and drive the Sheriff from his office. Tho friends of tho Sheriff band thorn* selves together In turn, meet force with force, and bloodshed is tho necessary result. Tins attempt of tho Democrats of Vicksburg to get rid of Republican county officers in a Republican county by force and violence, is a fair sample of the manner in which the party of violence in tho South hits defied law and sought to carry out its measures by force. To such, the statement of tho President is both n lessen and a warning. To persist any longer, therefore, in trying to THE

It is not a question whether tho black man is entitled to the righto of' a citir.cn and Is qualified to exorcise them. Tho block man j to a citizen, and must remain so. When this fact is recognized by all parties, peace will come, and not till then. THE LEGAL-TENDER ACT. The President advises and commends to Con gress (ha advice of the Secretary of tho Trens urythi',l;, ns n preliminary slop towards n re sumption of specie payments, Congress should by law tlx n date after which greenbacks shall conso to bo n legal tender except for debts contracted prior to that date. Tho groat argument heretofore used againat any return to specie payments Ims been, that it would be oppressive upon tho debtor class; that the latter have contracted debts upon tho basis of a depreciated currency whoso value has ranged from 50 to 00 cents on tho dollar, and Umt to compel the payment of such debts in coin or its equivalent would bo to add to tho indebtedness of tho individual Urn amount of the depreciation existing when the debt was created. This class includes not only in dividunlsj and private corporations, but it embraces tho whole range of municipal corporations, which in the aggregate owe nearly a thousand millions of dollar*. While wo do not consider tho avoidance of this Booming hardship na at all com : peusatiug for the general evil and loss : of a permanent suspension of specie pny- I meats, ending eventually in tho panio of 

IB7JI |,and wide-spread bankruptcy, wo have felt that the remonstrance hod considerable force. But the course recommended by tbo Presi dent avoids even tho appearance or possibili ty of any injustice to any one by lixlng a day in tho future after which all debts con tracted shall he upon the coin basis, leaving the greenback na now a legal tender so long os o debt remains unpaid. The proposition to return to apccio payments has been re sisted by those who have made loans of banks, and by the banka who havo outstand ing $350,000,001) of bank notes, which they would havo to redeem in coin; but. tbo plan now proposed takes away these objections. Greenbacks will remain a legal tender in pay ment of every note, bond, mortgage, or other form of indebtedness issued before tho date fixed by Congress. Any contract made after that dato will be made of necessity upon a coin basis, aud can work no possible injury or inconvenience to any one. Here, then, we have tho modo pointed out by which the country can gradually emerge from the depreciated currency standard of values without tho least shock or disturbance | of any right of either creditor or debtor ; and the re-establishment of tho business of tbo country on the real and permanent standard recognized by the whole commercial world. Tho time being fixed when all now contracts shall begin on a coin basis of value, without any disturbance of tho present legal tender for all existing contracts and debts, the busi ness of the country would rapidly so adapt itself to the coming change that tho transi tion from the one system to tho other would bo marked by no confusion or derangement. As tho President well points out, the return to specie payments must come at some time. Every day it is postponed hut oggravates tho evil and pushes the country nearer to general prostration, llesumption must bo brought about by tbo Government taking such steps as will promise beyond all doubt a resumption at some set time, or re sumption must come by tho general prostration of all credit and tho general repudiation of oil debts. A choice must bo ! made, and ought to bo mado at ns early a dato os practicable. Capital isabundnut, but is un employed. Wo have all tho means of pros perity. Labor is abundant, and tho capital to mako that labor productive is at hand. What is wanted is confidence—faith in future stability. Capital will not invest whoa tho national credit ia drifting no ono knows whore. Wo must begin anew without re pudiation, or wc must begin anew after re pudiation. The favorable action by Congress on tho recommendation of the Secretary of tho Treasury would havo mi instant eficct upon trade, production, and commerce. It would give that confidence that is now wonting, and set free the hoarded and unemployed capital which does not now dare a venture. It would put labor at productive employment of every character, and onco more place upon a per manent basis tho prosperity of the whole country. THE 

MATOB’S MESSAGE. There is only one point of comparison be tween tho President’s message and that of Mayor Colvin, —length. President Grant went over the whole field of our domestic and foreign relations os a nation in a little less space than Mr. Colvin required to deliver himself on tho condition of a single city. Tho Mayor’s message was a sort of mosaic; and, ns such, may bo regarded as a literary curiosity. The varieties of stylo which are presented in six columns are exactly equal to the number of heads of departments in tho City Government. Poor Joe Forrest was made to pay the penalty of his contribution by having to read the entire document before tho Council; but, perhaps, ho was the only man connected with tho present Administration who is familiar with the various handwritings of tho departmental chiefs. Tho composite stylo is a novelty in Executive messages, but, con sidering tho tedious length which it necessi tates, wo can scarcely give it our approval. The message might have been longer (though this is hardly 'possible) had not Mr. Colvin storied out with the comforting assurance that this is not “one of those special occa sions at times which call for prompt legisla tive action.” So far as Mr. Colvin entered upon tho suggestive field, ho directed bis ef forts to tho State Legislature and not to tho Common Council. For the rest, those who are willing to drag through several columns of heterogeneous matter to discover a few specimens of very funny stylos of composi tion will bo rewarded for their pains. Mr. Colvin must have been in a pleasant fronm of mind during tho construction of his message, for .he allowed every head of every department to congratulate himself ad libitum upon tho admirable manner in which ho had conducted his branch of tho City Government during the past twelve months. It would have boon more satisfactory to tho general public to have had on intelligent exhibit of tho city’s indebtedness, and practical sugges tions as to tho ways and meant, for escaping from the financial embarrassments vhloh wo vaguely feel to bo hanging over us, Ja place of this, however, ho presents ti s with some disjointed paragraphs and disconnected fig ures that utterly fall to throw any light upon our present condition. Tho most wo can loam in, that wo owe somewhere between six- toon aud seventeen millions, that move than three millions fall duo within tho next six mouths, and that wo have less than n million nml a half in tho Treasury all told. It is not very (iiicoimiging to bo told (hat 

SUVUO,I7IJ.IW, in tho shape of a tax-warrant for 1871, will bo in tho hands of the Collector by tho middle of this mouth, when wo know (lint nil this Ims been appropriated, ami are told that more than a million dollars of tho taxes of 18711 remain uncollected. It is true tho Mayor atiggoslu that thuro should always bo “ an export in lux-procccdlngs” connected with (lie Law Department 5 but ns tho city is now employing live or six “legal exports” In that department at an expense of over $20,000 a year in salaries, to say nothing of tho incidentals, wo should think this brunch of the Government is already pretty well pro vidod for. ■ Tho Mayor’s hint that the City Treasurer should not bo pormUtod to use or loan tho city moneys for his own benefit is timely; but wo question tho expediency of tho Conn oil’s undertaking to do UlO same thing, ns ho suggests. Wo have already had a sufficient experience with tho authorization, or assumed authorization, of lohning the monoyn of tbo city; and while it io within tho province of tho Council or city officials to sco that tbo City Treasurer does not loan or use tho funds, tho city itself will do well not to go into tho same business. Wo may admire Mr. Colvin’s generalizations on tbo subject of the reduction of our expenditures and limitation of our taxes, but wo fail to find in tbo ontlro six columns any practical suggestions to that ena. Cer tainly his quasi Approval of tho Court-Houso scheme is not in this direction; for, though ho advocates tho sale of city property for this purpose, ho must bo conscious that Court- House building will offer mi exbaustless op portunity for raids upon tho City Treasury. THE SPANISH QUESTION. The President's determination to reserve a moto detailed oUtemout of our relations with Spain for a future communication to Con gress seems to havo a special significance. We inke it to bo a notice to tbo Spanish Gov ernment that it must abandon its dilatory, double-dealing policy toward tills Govern ment, and make a speedy and satisfactory set tlement of tho differences between tho two nations. Tho Spanish authorities may taka tbo hint convoyed in the preceding paragraph of the message on tho condition of Cuba, and accept a lesson in fairness without push ing tiie matter any further. But if they do not, tho special message which tbo President will communicate to Congress on the subject v/ill undoubtedly bo expressed in such terms as to bring tbo difficulties to a direct issue, which will have to be settled on a basts dic tated by tbo United States os an outraged nation. If there is a people on tho face of tho earth who merit tho contempt of an independent and self-governing nation, it is tho Spanish people. Their glories, ouch as they are, must bo sought in the pages of history that may almost bo called ancient. They wore glories then only because civilization had not advanced to a proper appreciation of fair dealing, nor to a proper depreciation of vile cunning and brute force. Within tho present century, Spain has been an outlaw among nations. The buccaneers and pirates of former times have been simply repressed in their maraudings upon tho high seas and tho other nations of the world, and allowed to work out their own destiny. They set about it in tho same old cut-throat fashion; but, instead of cutting tho throats of foreigners, they have been engaged in slashing away at their own. Their inicracciuo struggles began with the death of Perdinnnd VII., and they have continued over since with varying success on tho part of the military despots, tho priest-ridden peasants, and the desperate Communists. All through tho reign of Isabella, the nation was a foot-boll for military dynasties. A change of Ministry was equivalent to a revolution ; but it was always a revolution that brought no relief to the people. It wus tho displacement of one military adventurer to make room for another. Then the people, unconscious that tho evils and weaknesses of their condition were all their own, thought to find relief in the com plete overthrow of the monarchy. Isabella was driven out of tho country only to leave chaos behind. On tho one side wore the Communists 5 on tho other tho Ultramontane priests. The Carlisle organized and offered Absolutism ns thosolutiouof their difficulties 5 the only opposition tho people have offered is anarchy. Tho struggle has been sustained with the desperation of a bandit race, en couraged by tho iguoronco and superstition of one party, and tho ignorance and vicious ness of tho other. Amadous sought to give them a Constitutional Government, but they could not comprehend it. Tho mountain dis tricts have been given over to tho despotism of tho Ullramontauos; tho cities to tho des potism of tho Communists. There ia hut one common ground on which both tho priest ridden and tho anarchist# have mot, —com- mon inhumanity. Their struggles have been characterized by the most barbarous cruel ties. All factions have evinced tho most brutal indifference to the rules of civilized warfare. Aliena and nou-combntauts have alike suffered from their barbarous practices. There is scarcely a nation that has not been visited with indignities or outrages at tho hands of some one of tho factions, and those factions have been hitherto treated with a forbearance that has now ceased to bo a virtue. It is no part of our national policy to in terfere with the domestic struggles of Spain so long as our rights receive respect and our interests arc not directly and unwarrantably assailed. But when the Spanish Government resumes its old-time arrogance along with its old-time brutality, and iirst assails and then insults tins Government, it becomes a duty to ourselves to assert and maintain our rights, 'With nil tho vicissitudes of Spain, there has been tho one central idea of keeping Cuba un der an iron hod, and of making her contribute of her great bounty to the support of tho Home Government. Tho policy has been one of extreme despotism and brutality. Not only have tho Cubans been made to sutler tho direst indignities and tho most brutal outrages, but Spain has gone to tho length of extending the eamo policy in Us relations with other nations whenever Cuba was concerned. The United States bnvo borne a full share of theso in dignities. Wo have suffered unjust commer cial discriminations without protest, and, at last, Spanish bravado dared ovon to seine an American vessel aud slaughter American citi zens. Wo foroboro, even at this, to adopt any severe measures of redress, and Spain has com:timed our forbearance into fear, and abused our patience. It is now time that she, bo called to a reckoning. Wo may stand idly by nud seo a nation of pro-slavery bandits in dulge their bloodthirsty propensities to their hearts 1 content so long tut they let ua alone. We mav oven justify our indifference to the Oubtui outrages so long as other nations hold aloof. But wo cannot consistent ly with our own dignity, nor in justice to our own interests, allow such a people to slaugh ter our citiiuniH and then delay just satisfac tion for tho outrage. The Virginius affair has hung in abeyance long enough. Lot uh have a prompt satisfaction of all our claims in (his matter, or, in default thereof, lot ns take snob steps .toward retribution as com mon Immunity suggests and our national dignity demands. There is nothing in our pant reloiioiw with Spain, nor in tho promise of tho future, nor in tho Spanish character, nor in its sham Republicanism, nor in its commercial dealing, nor in Urn law of nations, which claims a longer forbearance on our part. 

STATE BOVEUEIGNTT—AGAIN, Tho few Democratic papers which have at tempted to hold Tim Chicago Teiduhe guilty of libeling the Democratic party by imputing to ii tho doctrine that tho United States ore a nation, possessing all tho inherent pow ers of nationality, and not tho more agent acting under delegated powers of sovereign States, are evoking sharp roplioo from those other Democratic papers that rep resent Democratic constituencies. State sov ereignty is not popular in Republican Michi gan, and tho Detroit Free Press refuses to ac knowledge it as pact of tho Democratic creed. In Democratic Missouri, tho St. Louis Times declares that the General Government is bnt tho agent of tho several States, Tho Chi cago IHmes, under the pretext of “ inde pendent journalism," though at heart a Dem ocratic paper, donounceo State sovereignty as a fraud, and denounces all those who advo cate it os ignorant and dangerous enemies of tho country j while down in Georgia tho Democratic papers, so far oh we have seen, all insist that the election of 1870 must turn on that issue. Now comos tho Dubuque Telegraphy edited by that veteran Democrat, D. A. Mahoney, who insists that the “principle which was, and for onr part which we hope Blill is, the doctrine of tho Democratic parly, that tho Slates are sovereign,” and that “ tho General Government at Washington ia but an agency ” of tho people,—that is, tho sovereign States, —is just. It goes further, and declares that to charge that the Democratic party, if rostered to power, will pay the people of tho South their individual losses dur ing tho War “is to pay that party a com pliment upon its fairness and justice ”; and then proceeds to nrgtio in favor of paying all tho losses of nil persons who cannot bo proved to hove been a Rebel. Just imagine where such a doctrine leads to. How many hundreds of millions of dollars would be re quired to discharge tho claims for damages in the South under such Democratic construc tion of the legal obligations of tho “ Wash ington agency of tho sovereign States”? Tho next assumption will be that only those who were voluntarily and willfully Rebels con bo denied full and amplo compensation for all their losses during tho Rebellion. Tho Louisville Courier-Journal, which at drat was disposed to ridicule the idea that tho Democratic party, if restored to power, would adhere to the doctrine of State sovereignty, now copies from this paper the following : paragraph: There is no escaping tho fact that the fundamental Issue between tho two parlies is, that tho Itopubllcnn party bolds tho United titatis to bo a nation possessing every power necessary to a complete nationality *, that It buhls tbeso powers, not as a gift from tbo States, nor aa on agent of other sovereignties, but as a nation in no wise dependent upon tbo States. Tbo Domo cfitlo party holds, on the contrary, that this not a nation, but a confederacy* of sovereign States, which have delegated certain limited powers to a certain federal agency; that tbo General Government is a creation by original sovereignties whose Inherent sov ereignty is intact. This the Courier-Journal concedes “is a just and candid statement of the chief issue between the two parties,” and adds: It Is jun upon thin tamo thnlwe meet The Tcitiune, though It declares It Is *'Journalistic folly verging on insanity” for ub to do bo. Wo maintain that the States which gave birth' and life to the Federal Govern* moot wore, independent aovorolmillea boforo that Government was formed; that the latter is the crea ture, and not the creator, of the former; that tlie Fedornl head la tho mere agent of the people of tho Stales; that its powers are defined and limited by the Constitution; and that It la dependent upon the States for its life and perpetuity. The same paper now says that, up to tho time of tho "War, “no person of respectable intelligence could be found to dispute " this Democratic doctrine; and that, unless the en tire character of tho Government has since boon changed, it is equally true now. It then proceeds to deny that tho character of the Government is any tho loss that of a con federacy or on agont exorcising certain dele gated powers received from tho States. Tho same paper insists that tho Southern people will not claim compensation for damages sus tained in tho War; but tho fact is they have done bo already, and are now doing so, and when tho Democratic party comes into power denying that any citizen who obeyed tho order of his sovereign State could com mit any crime thereby, there will be on ava lanche of those claims, bached up by “sov ereign Stotes,” for compensation for damages inflicted upon these people by a “ mcro agent" without authority from tho prin cipals. TEN MILLIONS GONE. Tho Secretary of tho Interior in his annual report gives ns tho total cost of construction, surveys, equipment, and operating expenses of tho Northern Pacific Railway. tho sum of $21,808,410, and the amount of outstanding bonds and other indebtedness at $81,658,001. What has become of the missing ton millions of dollars? It will bo noticed that tho de ficiency is full 00 per cent of tho cost of tho road. For every dollar expended on tho road, somebody bos taken a toll of 00 cents. Instead of ten millions surplus, equal to tho construction of several hundred miles of railroad, tho Company owes that much in ex cess of what it has expended on tho part of tho road completed. Has this money or any part of it been “ placed where it will do tho most good ” ? Who has got it ? and what was tho consideration therefor P Tho Company which has wasted this §32,- 000,000—actually given away one-half as much ns it has sunk in tho roadway of a use. less road—is at Washington asking Congress to give it fifty or sixty millions of dollars out of the Treasury to complete its useless road 1 Failing in this, it proposes to surrender its land-grant in consideration of so many thou sands of dollars per mile. Substantially, it proposes to sell the land back lor double what it is worth to tho General Government. That is whipping tho devil around tho stump with a vengeance. In tho meantime, with tho fact (hat the Company has already given away or squandered ten millions of dollars, aud expended but iweaty-ouo millions, Con gress ought to understand what will booomo of any subsidy that may bo voted by tho Gen eral Government out of tho National Treas ury. Tho Credit-Mobillor affair Is not so old us to be forgotten, aud has not yob blown over, aud one rotten and dishonest operation is no justiffontlou for another. No uum aan vote for this subsidy, or any subsidy to this or any other road, without doing so with a full knowledge of the past and of tho judg ment to como.

Wo aro surprised that a “Lawyer” has road our Supremo Court editorials with so poor an understanding. lie moots but one .point, while wo have endeavored to cover tbo whole caso and point out tho proper remedies. Wo have already shown that, under our laws, the Court is forced to givo contrary instructions I’uruiohod by tho opposing attorneys? and (hut, after ell tho rulings and instructions, tho jury is itself tho Judge of tho law, and may disregard tho points of tbo Court whenever it sees lit. Wo havo called for tho repeal of tho statutes which permit of the present abuses. If there is a “Lawyer” who fails to comprehend tho arguments we havo made at length, wo must decline to go all over thorn again for tho benefit of hia individual obluttouesa. Imogino the disrpiiot of tho world in general should tho Tichborno Claimant summon a crowd round hia death-bod In order to hoar his con fession, and then whisper tho'.words “Ism ” and die. It would bo Uttlo abort of infamous, and both Dr. Koucnly and his opponents would unito In denouncing tho confession as a swindle. And yet not long ago a man did it who had boon lost half a dozen ycavu in Florida. 110 turned up recently younger by 30 years at least than when ho went away. He cJoiraod a great deal of property, and whou folks asked him how ho could, oven with his illimitable cheek, account for hia rejuvenation, ho was equal to tho emergency. Ho said that whilo wandering with Ida littlo boy in Florida ho fell into tho famous Fountain of Youth, sought by Fonco do Loon in tho swamps of Florida, and was rojuvouatod against his will. Thou ho ducked bis boy, and tho boy remained a hoy over since, and a young ono at that. Ills case was threo times triad, and an ex pedition sent to find tho Fountain, which it novor did, and never would oveu if it searched until that Immortal boy grow to Methusaleh’s age. The third tiruo tho suit was being tried our Tithonus nearly bamboozled tho jury into de ciding in his favor. Bat while peddling Demo cratic tickets at tho polls on election day an en terprising friend tested his immortal youth with an ounce of lead lu hia vitals (a way they havo in Florida), mid ho wont through tho imitating pau toralno of saying something to arm both sides in tbo suit. Ho was smart ? but with all his brill iancy could not toll tho truth. Pastoral visitation is attended with a now peril in Texas. It is not tho languishing love of tho fair but frail feminine parishioner which threatens to put an end to ministerial useful ness so much as n more material danger. Ac cording to the Dallas Commercial, tbo pastor of a fashionable church called on a nowly-ar rivod business man ot his ofllco, welcomed him, and invited his wife to call at the parsonage and have a good time. The business man, with that indecision of character which business men show in spiritual matters, said "that would be all right,” and tho proacbor went his way. Ho found out bis new friend’s residence, and in tho absence of tbo husband made a '• pastoral visit.” Tbo lady of tho house asked him his business. Ho said bo came on on errand of mercy and peace. She said she didn’t approve of gentlemen visitors in her husband’s absence, and ho replied that he was a clergyman and above suspicion, and eat down. She said aho didn’t know about that, and wasn’t going to risk anything. And when ho found tbo revolver under his nose was absolutely loaded aud cocked, ho thought ho wouldn't risk anything either, and obeyed her mandate to “ got out of there ” with a singleness of purpose consistent with a Christian life, and » gymnastic feat that would have gained him national reputa tion in the saw-dust ring. A private letter from a clergyman in Port Scott, Kan., pictures tho destitution there as it comes to tho knowledge of a visiting minister in terms which bring tho boodoo borne. Many of tbo poor peo ple in bis parish havo absolutely nothing to live npou. Some of them have come iu from tboir distant farms hoping to secure enough to keep life in their wivos ami little ones through tho help of tbo bonovolont; one family bad lived upon salt-pork aud corn-meal for three months; another family bad been so long without sus tenance that their lint xnoal threatened to ho tboir last. Some havo suffered two consecutive years from tho persecutions of tbo locust, and their littlo farms aro mortgaged to their full value. Tho writer says: “Ip a small town, and one small church, one soon ex hausts the surplus of tho bonovolont, and these repeated calls weary thorn.” Tbo loiter was written in acknowledgment of tho receipt of a box of food and clothing sent tho writer for dis tribution among tho suffering poor in bis imme diate vicinity. Tbo bonovolont of Chicago who would liko to supplement tbo good work done by this ouo box can And plenty of opportunity by addressing tbo Bov. W. 0. Porter, pastor of tho Presbyterian Church at Fort Scott, Kansas, Prohibition against liquor stimulates the in vention of the saloon-keeper without dispensing with tbo stimulation which is bis stock Iu trade. Xu Waterloo, la., where the license has boon raised to a prohibitory figure, tho saloon baa been crushed out, and a healthy specimen of club-room has grown upon its remains. Tbo ex-publican sells stock in his club-room, having formed a corporation under tiro Stato law, and issues certificates of atook iu the form of cards. When tho bibnlous member of tho club takes a glass of beer, bis ticket Is punched; when ben zine la colled for, or 11 dry cabbage,” two holes aro made, The price of liquor Is therefore re duced, and dram-drinking made both fashion ablo and Ingenious. Honco drunkenness is on tho increase at Waterloo, aud tho liquor-dealer thrives accordingly. A proat deal depends upon the decision cf the caou la which tho Uoira of Mro. Crugor ace con toatiug hor will, iu which oho left £1523,000 to the American Bible Society and nothing to hor family. It is very clear that she was very in sane when she mode her will, cud made a sort of bargain with the devil not to pursue her, by promising to leave her property In this way. As before hinted, half tho plouu bequests In history would ho sat aside upon this ground. Bat hero to the point. If it can readily be shown that leaving money to a aoolety was a symptom of In sanity, contested wills will become so numerous that tho religious institutions will die of in anition. Mayor Colvin solves the problem of poor gas In Ida message « “All attachments and globular appendages which give a strange and globular appearance arc no more than ornamental.

Pnlr man I Levi Hopkins, Superintendent of the Northern Home for Friendless Children for the past eighteen years, died Thursday at that institution in Philadelphia. Ho was well known throughout Pennsylvania. That story about Governor-elect Gaston mak ing lots of money out of real-estate investments in Colorado doesn't prove to bo a trun one.
