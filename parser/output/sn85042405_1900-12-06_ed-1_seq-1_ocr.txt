In our foreign intercourse the domi­ nant question has b'-en the treatment of the Chinese problem. Apart from this our relations with the foreign pow­ ers have been happy. The recent troubles in China sj ring from the anti-foreign agitation, which for the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races and in th" tradi­ tions of their government. The- Taip ing rebellion and the opening: of Chi­ nese ports to foreign trade and settle­ ment disturbed alike the hornog' neity and the seclusion of China. Meanwhile foreign activity made it­ self felt in ail quarters, not alone on the coast, but along the great river ar­ teries and in the remoter districts, car­ rying new ideas and introducing new associations among a primitive people which had pursued for centuries a na­ tional policy of isolation.

The increasing gravity of the condi­ tions in China and the imminence of peril to our own divorsitied interests in the empire as well as to those of all the other treaty governments, were soon appreciated by this governni' nt, causing it profound solicitude. The United States from the earliest (lays of foreign intercourse with China had fol­ lowed a policy of peace, omitting 110 oc­ casions to testify good will, to further the extension of iawt'ul trade, to respect the sovereignty of its government, and to insure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest means the fullest measure of protection for the lives and property of our law-...riding citizens and for the exercise of tlu-ir beneficent tailings among the Chinese people. Mindful of tills, it was felt to be ap­ propriate that our purposes should be pronounced in favor of such course as would hasten united action of the pow­ ers at Pekin to promote the administra­ tive reforms so greatly needed for strengthening the imperial government and maintaining the integrity of China, in which we believe the whole western world to be alike concerned. To these ends I caused to be addressed to the sev­ eral powers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of influence in China the circular proposals of 1SD0, Inviting from them declarations of their intentions and views as to the desira­ bility of the adoption of measures in­ juring the benefits of equality of treat­ ment of all foreign trade throughout China. With gratifying unanimity the re­ sponses coincided in this common pol­ icy, enabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiations proot of the friendly spirit which animates "the various powers interested In the untrammeled development of commerce and industry in the Chinese empire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial world. In this conclusion, which had the gratification to announce as a complet­ ed engagement to the interested pow ers on March :!0. lOnri, hopefully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust of foreign purposes which for a year past had appeared to in­ spire th" policy of the imperial gov­ ernment in he northern provinces moat immediately Influenced by the Manchu sentiment. Reeking to testify confidence in the willingness rind stability of the impe­ rial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils we suffered ami feared, the marine guard, which had been sent to tvkin in the summer of 1899 for the protection of the legation, was withdrawn at the earliest practica­ ble moment, and all pending questions were remitf as far as re cerned. to the ordinary reports of dip­ lomatic intercourse IMUNCE THAN TilK LK.VD1IK.

The Chinese government proved, how­ ever, unable to check the rising strength nf FXi- UOYITS ami aonf-arpd 1 1 to be fL prey to iiirernal diVse'i?.-ions. In the unequal contest the anti-l'oreign influences soon gained the ascendancy under the leadership of Prince Tuan. Organized armies of Boxers. with which (lie Imperial forces affiliated, held the country between Pekin and the coast, penetrated into Manchuria up to the Russian border, and through t.heir emissaries threatened a like rising throughout northern China. Attacks upon foreigners, destruction of their property, and slaughter of na­ tive converts were reported from all Bides. The tsung-li-yamen, already permeated with hostile sympathies, could make no effective response to the appeals o£ the legations. At this crit­ ical junc'tire, in the early spring of this year, a proposal was made by the other powers that a combined fleet should be assembled in Chinese waters as a moral demonstration, under cover of which to exact of the Chinese gov­ ernment respect for foreign tr(aty rights and the suppression of the Box­ ers. The United States, while not partici­ pating in the joint demonstration, promptly sent from the Phillippiiies all ships that could be spared for rvice on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines were landed at Taku and sent to Pekin for the protection of the American legation. Other powers took similar action, until some 400 men were assiembled in the capital as legation guards. [The president here tells of the siege of the legations at Pekin, the landing of troops and the rescue of the foreign ministers.) Taliing, as a point of departure, the imperial edict appointing Karl la Hung Chang and Prince Ching plenipotentiar­ ies to arrange a setttoir.ent, and the edict of Sept. 25, whereby certain high officials were designated for punish­ ment, this government lias moved, in concert with the other powers, toward the opening of negotiations, which Mr. Conger, assisted by Mr. Jlockliill. has been authorized to conduct on behalf of the United Stat.-s. General bases of negotiation formu­ lated by the government the Kivm-h republic have been accepted with cer­ tain reservations as to deiails, made necessary by our own circutest an es, but, like similar reservations by other powers, open to discussion in the prog­ ress of the negotiations. Tin- disposi­ tion of the emperor's government to admit liability for wrongs (lme to for­ eign governments and their nationals, ar.d to act upon such additional desig­ nation of the guilty persons as the for­ eign ministers at Pekin may be in a po­ sition to make, gives hope of a complete settlement of all finest ions involved, as­ suring foreign rights of residence and intercourse on terms of equality for all the world. 1 regard as one of the essential fac­ tors of a durable adjustment the se eurement of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since inseem ity of those natives who may embrace alien creeds is a scarcely less effectual as­ sault upon the rights of foreign wor­ ship and teaching th."n would be the di­ rect invasion thereof. The matter of indemnity for our wronged ci'izens is a question of grave concern. Mc-asured in minify alone, a sufficient reparation may prove to be beyond the ability of China to meet. AH the power? concur in emphatic dis­ claimers of any purpose of ro^.grandize ment through dismemberment of the empire. am disposed to think that due compensation may he made in part by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights and imnnir.ities. and. most important of all. by the opening of China to the equal commerce of a'l the world.

CANAL. Overture-* for Convention to l-IH'oct Its Iti.iUling by tlie I nit.-d Stnts. The all-important matter of an inter oceanic caiiut has assumed a new phase. Adhering to its refusal to reopt the question of the forfeiture of the con­ tract of the Maritime Canal company, which was terminated for alleged non exeeution in October, 18!t"J. the govern­ ment of Nicaragua has since supple­ mented that action by declaring the so styled Kyie-Cramin option void for non-payment of the stipulated advance. Protests in relations to these acts have been filed In the state department and are under consideration. Deeming it­ self relieved from existing engage­ ments. the Nicaraguan government shows a dispositon to deal freely with the canal question either in lie way of negotiations with the United States or by taking measures to promote the wa­ terway. Overtures for a convention to effect the building of a canal under tile aus­ pices of the United States are under consideration. In the meantime the views of the congress upon the general subject, in the light of the report of the commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of the various trans-isthmian ship canal projects may be awaited. I commend to the early attintion of the senate the convention with Great Britain to facilitate the construction of such, a canal and to remove any objec­ tion whhih might arise out of the con­ vention commonly called the Chiyton Bnlwer treaty. The long standing eontenti. with Portugal, growing oot of the seizure of the Delagoii Bay railway, lias 1 een at last tfrniired by a favorable award of the tribunal of arbitration at Kerne, to which it was submitted. The amount of the uward which was dep. si'.d in T.ondon awaiting arrangements by the governments of the I'n.ited Plates and Gr-at Mritnin for its disp sal, has re­ cently h( en paid over to the two gov­ ernment®.

On June 7 last the first ses­ sion of the Fifty-sixth congress ad­ journed and tho second session began during tho day with many momentous questions waiting tho attention of the national lawmakers. Early in tlie day the tido of humanity turned down Pennsylvania avenue toward the Capitol, filling the broad walks leading to the marble terrace, •which by 11 o'clock presented a scene of busy activity. On the eastern plaza front there was the same scene of ac­ tivity, long liues of carriages swinging up to tho wings, bringing senators, members of the house, public officials and' interested observers, while the in any lines of cars contributed their quota of tho interested public. Inside tho building but little restriction hud been placed on the free moving of the throng and the crowd moved at will 1 roin One Wing to the Oilier. All of the 1 ublic galleries were open, bo that every one in the good nutured crowd had an equal chance. By 11 o'clock tho elevators began to be be­ sieged and there wero signs of an over­ flow at tho doors leading to the gal­ leries. It was evident that the ladies took great iuterest in the procedure, for they were present in full force, one delegation of girl students numbering over 00. There were conferences among senfc ators as to the programmo of the week and unusual activity was displayed by members ou both sides of the Capitol. Speaker Henderson arrived at his private office about 11:15 and was soon surrounded by members discussing the programme of business. On the senate 6ide there was less evidence of activity and the crowds were rather slow in in­ vading tho galleries. The president pro tem, Mr. Fryo, was at his office early, conferring with senators, and by 11:30 the floor of the senate began to show signs of activity preceding actual bnsiness.
