PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE President Roosevelt In bis annual message again urges the enactment of a law prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign funds. He also urges the passage of the measure conferring upon the government the right of appeal in criminal casea on questions of law. Continuing, the president says: I cannot too strongly urge the pas sage of the bill in question. A failure to pass it will result in seriously ham pering the government In Its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong, and may also prevent the government from obtaining Justice for wageworkers who are not them selves able effectively to contest a case where the Judgment of an Inferior court has been against them. I have specifically In view a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway employees without remedy for viola tion of a certain so called labor statute. The Importance of enacting into law the particular bill in question Is fur ther Increased by the fact that the gov ernment has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law In those trust and Interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. Proper Cn of Injunctions. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law In connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of ap plying Injunctions In labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of Injunctions In such cases would stand the test of the courts, In which case, of course, the legislation would be Ineffective. More over, I believe it would be wrong alto gether to prohibit the use of injunc tions. It is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law, and If men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no Im pairment of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. Against Lynching. I call your attention and the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us and, above all, to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up now In one part of our country, now In another. Each sec tion, north, south, east or west, has its own faults. No section can with wisdom spend its time jeering at the faults of another section. It should be busy trying to amend its own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption It Is necessary to have an awakened public conscience and to supplement this by whatever legisla tion will add speed and certainty in the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more Is neces sary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime Is peculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the hideous crlm^ of rape, the most abominable in all the category of crimes, even worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon, and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the iynchings are not for rape at all, while a considerable proportion of the Individuals lynched are innocent of all crime. There is but one safe rule in dealing with black men as with white men. It is the same rule that must be ap plied In dealing with rich men and poor men—that is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed or his so cial position, with even handed justice on his real worth as a man. White people owe it quite as much to them selves as to the colored race to "treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves such treatment. There is no question of social equality or negro dominatiou Involved. In my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as Is the case with murder. Assault with intent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least In the discretion of the court, and provision should be made by which the. punish ment may fallow immediately upon the heels of the'offeuse. No more shortsighted policy can be Imagiued than In the fancied interest of oue class to prevent the education of another class. The white man', if he is wise, will decline to allow the negroes in a mass to grow to man hood and womanhood without educa tion. •'Preachers of Mere Discontent." In dealing with both labor and cap ital, with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there Is one matter more important to re member than aught else, and that Is the Infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent These are the men who seek to excite a violent class ha tred against all men of wealth. They keek to turn wise and proper move ments for the better control of corpora tions and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth Into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim is to in Same to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogues knd foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign #f destruction sometimes seek to as lociate themselves with those working, for a genuine reform in governmental Ind social methods and sometimes mas querade aa inch reformers. In reality they aip the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, Just aa tbe purveyors of sensational slander In newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies of all men who' are engaged In an honest effort to better what Is bad In oUr social and governmental condi tions. Corruption Is never so rife as In com munities where the demagogue and the agitator bear fqll sway, because In such communities all moral bands be come loosened, and hysteria and sens& tlonallsm replace tbe spirit of sound Judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolfcagalnst the sqUalld anarchy thus produced men are sure in the end to turn toward any leader who can restore order, and then their relief at being free from the in tolerable burdens of class hatred, vio lence and demagogy Is such that they cannot for some time be aroused to In dignation against misdeeds by men of wealth, so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were In part responsible for the original out break. The one hope for success for our people lies in a resolute and fear less but sane and cool headed advance along the path marked out last year by this very congress. There must be a stern refusal to be. misled Into fal lowing either that base creature who appeals and panders to the lowest ro stincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or that other creature, equally base, but no basex, who In a spirit of greed or to accumulate or add to an already huge fortune seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous dis regard to their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others In order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit, and when hatred Is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. Tbe plain people who think—the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors—owe It to them selves to remember, that the most dam aging blow that can be given popular government Is to elect an unworthy, and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Railroad Employee*' Hour*. I call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. The measure Is a very moder ate one, and I can conceive of no seri ous objection to it. Indeed, so far as It is In our power, It should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general in troduction of an eight hour day. There are industries in which it Is not pos sible that the hours of labor should be reduced, just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, If in the tropics, so situated that there is no analogy between their needs an& ours In this matter. On the isthmuB of Panama, for Instance, the condi tions are In every way so different from what they are here that an eight hour day would be absurd, Just as It Is absurd, so far as the Isthmus Is con cerned, Where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely Industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint It should be our object to do what we can In the direc tion of securing the general observance of an eight hour day. Let me again urge that the congress provide for a thorough investigation of the conditions of child labor and of the labor of women in the United States. The horrors Incident to the employment of young children In fac tories or at work anywhere are a blot on our civilization. In spite of all precautions exercised by employers there are unavoidable ac cidents and even deaths involved in nearly every line of business connect ed with the mechanic arts. It is a great social injustice to compel the em ployee, or, rather, the family of tbe killed or disabled victim, to bear the entire burden of such an inevitable sacrifice. In other words, society shirks Its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas the Injury comes from what may be called the legiti mate risks of the trade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due In any line of industry to tbe actual conditions un der which that industry Is carried on should be paid by that portion of the coi&nunity for the benefit of which the industry is carried on—that Is, by those who profit by the Industry. If tbe entire trade risk Is placed upon tbe employer, be will promptly and prop erly add it to the legitimate cost of pro duction and assess It 'proportionately upon the consumers of bis commodity. It is therefore clear to my mind -that the law should place this entire "risk of a trade" upon the employer. Capital and Labor Disputes. Records show that'during the twen ty years from Jan. 1, 1881, to Dec. 31, 1900, there were strikes affecting 117, 609 establishments, and 6,105,694 em ployees were thrown out of employ ment. During the same period there Were 1,005 lockouts,' Involving nearly 10,000 establishments, throwing over 1,000,000 people out of employment These strikes and lockouts Involved an estimated loss to employees of $307, D00.0M and to employers of $143,000, 900, a total of $450,000,000. The public •ufferad directly and indirectly prob ably as great additional loss. Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred bad the par ties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced body representing the nation and, face to bee, state tbe reasons for their con­ 1 tention. The exercise of a Judicial •plrlt by a disinterested body repre senting tbe federal government, such as would be provided by a commission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create an atmosphere of friend liness and conciliation between con tending parties. Control of Corporations. It cannot too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shown the Impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but Ineffective chaos In the way of dealing with tbe great corporations which do not oper ate exclusively within tbe limits of any one state. In some method, wheth er by a national license law or In other fashion, we must exercise,1 and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corporations—a control that will, among other things, prevent the evils of ex cessive overcapitalization and that will compel the disclosure by each big cor poration of Its stockholders and of Its properties and business, whether own ed directly or through subsidiary, or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the securing of Inor dinate profits by favored Individuals at tbe expense whether of the general public, the stockholders or the wage workers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control It as to see that it results in no harm to the people. Combination of capital, like combina tion of labor, Is a necessary element of our present Industrial system. It Is not possible completely to prevent it, and if it were possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic.' What we need Is not vainly to try to prevent all combina tion, but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their Injuring the public or existing in such form as inevitably to threaten Injury, for the mere fact tbat a combination has secured practically complete con trol of a necessary of life would under any circumstances show that such combination was 'to be presumed to be adverse to the public interest It is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid all combinations instead of sharply discriminating between those combinations which do good and those combinations which do evil. Re bates, for instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers (as was shown in the investigation of the Standard Oil company and as has been shown since by the Investigation of the tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the Initiative of big railroads. Often rail roads would like to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining improper, advantages at the expense of small shippers and of the general public. Such a combina tion, instead of being forbidden by law, should be favored. In other words, it Bhould be permitted to railroads to make agreements, provided these agree- ments were sanctioned by the inter state commerce commission and were published. With these two conditions complied with it Is impossible to see what harm such a combination could do to the public at large. Inheritance and Income Tax. The national government has long derived its cbief revenue from a tariff on imports and from an Internal or ex cise tax. In addition to these, there is every reason why, when next our sys tem of taxation Is revised, the national government should impose a graduated Inheritance tax and, If possible, a grad uated Income tax. I am well aware that such a subject as tbis needs long and careful study In order that the people may become fa miliar with what Is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceeding with wisdom and self re straint and may make up their minds Just how far they are willing to go in the matter, while only trained legisla tors can work out the project in neces sary detail. But I feel that In the near future our national legislators should enact a law providing for a graduated Inheritance tax by which a steadily in creasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest or devise to' any individual or corporation. There can be no question of the ethical pro priety of tbe government thus deter mining the conditions upon which any gift or Inheritance should be received, As the law now stands It Is undoubt edly difficult to devise a national in come tax which shall be constitutional. But whether it is absolutely impossible is another question, and if possible it Is most certainly desirable. Tbe first purely income tax law was passed by tbe congress in 1861, but the most Im portant law dealing with the subject was tbat of 1894. nils the court held to be unconstitutional. Tbe question is undoubtedly very In tricate, delicate and troublesome. Tbe decision of the court was only reached by one majority. It is the law of the land and of course Is accepted as such and loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Nevertheless the hesitation evidently felt by tbe court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when considered to gether with previous decisions on the subject may perhaps indicate the pos sibility of devising a constitutional in come tax law which shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at The difficulty of amending the constitution Is so great that only real necessity can Justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made In dealing with this subject as with the subject of the proper control by the national govern ment over the use of corporate wealth In Interstate business, to devise legis lation wblch without such action shall attain the desired end, bbt if this fails tkere will ultimately be no alternative to a constitutional amendment IiiutrUI Tnlilig. Our industrial development depends largely upon technical education, In­ cluding In this term all Industrial edu cation, from tbat which fits a man to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter or blacksmith to that wblch (Its a man to do the greatest engineering feat The skilled mechanic, the skilled work man, can best become such by tech nical Industrial education. The far teaching usefulness of Institutes of technology and schools of mines or of engineering Is now universally ac knowledged, and no less far reaching fs the effect of a good building or me chanical trades school a textile or watchmaking or engraving school In every possible way we should help tbe wageworker who tolls with his hands and who must (we hope In a constantly increasing measurq} also toll with bis brain. Under the constltUr tlon the national legislature can do but little of direct importance for bis wel fare save where be Is engaged In work wblch permits It to act under the In terstate commerce clause of the consti tution, and this is one reason why I so earnestly hope tbat both tbe legis lative and judicial branches of th« gov ernment will construe this clause of the constitution In the broadest possi ble manner. The Farmer. The only other persons whose wel fare Is as vital to the welfare of tbe whole country as is tbe welfare of the Wageworkers are the tillers of the soli, tbe farmers. Several factors must co-operate in the improvement of tbe farmer's con dition. He must have the chance to be educated in the widest possible sense, In tbe sense which keeps ever in view the intimate relationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. Organization has become necessary In tbe business world, and it has ac complished much for good In the world of labor. It Is no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement Is good In Itself and Is capable of a well nigh infinite fur ther extension for good so long as It is kept to Its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by tbe as sociation of farmers for mutual ad vantage are partly economic and part ly sociological. Irrlaratlon and Forest Preservation. Much is now being done for the states of the Rocky mountains and great plains through the development of the national policy of irrigation and forest preservation. No government policy for the betterment of our inters nal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. Divorce Legislation. I am well aware of how difficult it is to pass a constitutional amendment Nevertheless, In my judgment the whole question of marriage and di vorce should be relegated to the au thority of tbe national congress. The change would be good from every standpoint. In particular it would be good because It would confer on the congress the power at once to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy, and this should be done whether or not marriage and divorce are dealt with. It Is neither safe nor proper to leave tbe question of polygamy to be dealt with by the several states. Merchant Marine. Let me once again call the attention of the congress to two subjects con cerning which I have frequently be fore communicated with them. One is the question of developing American shipping, trust that a law embody ing In substance the views or a major part of the views expressed in the re port on this subject laid before tbe house at its last session will be passed. It seems to me that the proposed meas ure Is as nearly unobjectionable as any can be. The Cnrrencr. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aid ing the enormous business develop ment of the country, and within ten years there has been an Increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating that additional leg islation is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the de fects of tbe present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to in cur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary of the treasury had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. I do not press any especial plan. Va rious plans have recently been pro posed by expert committees of bank ers. Among the plans which are possi bly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is tbat re peatedly brought to your attention by the present secretary of the treasury, the essential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan, national banks should be permitted to Issue a specified propor tion of their capital In notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so blgb a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted In legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of currency to give banks additional prof Its, but to meet the emergency present ed by times of stringency. I do not say that this is the right sys tem. I only advance it to emphasize my belief tbat there Is need for the adoption of some system which shall be automatic and open to all sound banks so as to avoid ail possibility of discrimination and favoritism. The law should be amended so as specifically to provide tbat the funds derived from customs duties may be treated by the secretary of the treas­ ury as he treats funds Obtained under tbe Internal revenue laws. Tbera^j should be a considerable Increase In? bills of small denominations. Permis slon should be gtven banks. If necessa ry under settled restrictions, to retire""' their circulation to a larger amount than three millions a month. Oar Oatlytasr Possessions. I most earnestly hope that tbe bill to. provide a lower tariff for or else abso* lute free trade In Philippine products. will become a law. No harm will come to any American Industry, and, »whlle there will be some small but real mate rial benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit will come by the showing made as to our purpose to do all In our power. for their welfare. Porto Mean Affairs. American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan, In Porto Rico, should be dredged and Improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. Hawaii. The needs of Hawaii are peculiar, Every aid should be given the Islands, and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the lines of a com-' munlty of small freeholders, not of great planters with cooly tilled es tates. Alaska. Alaska's needs have Men partially met, but there must be a complete re organization of the governmental sys tem, as I have before indicated to you. I' ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow citizens who dwell on the shores of Puget sound with character istic energy are arranging to hold In Seattle tbe Alaska-Yukon-Paclflc ex position. This exposition In Its pur poses and scope should appeal not only to tbe people of the Pacific slope, but to the people of the United States at large. Rlckts of Aliens. Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with Justice and good will all Immigrants who come here under the law. Whether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or gentile, whether .they come from England or Germany, Russia,- Japan or Italy, mat ters nothing. All we have a right to question is the man's conduct .If he Is honest and upright In his dealings with his neighbor and with the state, then he is entitled to respect and good treatment Especially do we need to remember our duty to the stranger within our gates. It is the sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against or In any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and who is con ducting himself properly. To remem ber this is incumbent on every Amer ican citizen, and it Is of course pecul iarly Incumbent on every government official, whether of the nation or of the several states. I am prompted to say' this by tbe attitude of hostility here and there as sumed toward tbe Japanese in this country. Tbis hostility Is sporadic and Is limited to a very few places. Never theless It Is most discreditable to us as a people, and It may be fraught with tbe gravest consequences to tbe nation. I ask fair treatment for tbe Japanese as I would ask fair treatment for Ger mans or Englishmen, Frenchmen, Rue-, sians or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity and civilization. I ask it as due to ourselves, because we must act uprightly toward all men. I recom mend to the congress that an act be passed specifically providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come' here intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrass ments attending tbe performance of our International obligations is the fact tbat tbe statutes of the United States are entirely inadequate. They fail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through Unit ed States courts and by tbe use of tbe army and navy, to protect aliens in tbe rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and add ed to as to enable tbe president, acting for the United States government, which is responsible in our interna tional relations, to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties. The Cnbaa Matter. Last August an Insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grew evi dent that tbe existing Cuban govern ment was powerless to quell Thanks to the preparedness of our navy, I was able Immediately to send enough ships to Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless, and I fur thermore dispatched to Cuba tbe sec retary of war and tbe assistant secre tary of state In order tbat they might grapple with tbe situation on the ground. In accordance with tbe so called Piatt amendment, wblch was embod led In the constitution of Cuba, I there upon proclaimed a provisional govern ment for the Island, the secretary of war acting as provisional governor un til he could be replaced by Mr. Magnpn, the late minister to Panama and gov ernor of the canal cone on the Isthmus. Troops were sent to support them and to relieve the navy, tbe expedition be lng bandied with most satisfactory J# speed and efficiency. Peace has come'®^ In the island, and the harvesting of the.fs^, sugar cane crop, the great crop of the! Island, is about to proceed. When tbe1 election has been held and the new government Inaugurated In peaceful! and orderly fashion tbe provisional1, government will come to an end. *t 1 The United States wishes nothing off' Cuba except tbat it shall prosper mor-''" ally and materially and wishes nothing of tbe Cubans save tbat they shall be)//', able to preserve order among them-' -4 selves and therefore to preserve tbelr a
