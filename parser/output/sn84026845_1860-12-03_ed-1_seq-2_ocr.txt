Most of them contain allusions to the present disturbed condition of po litical affairs, and may be held to, in a measure, represent the sentiments of the Christian community. Every one must rejoice at the conciliatory tone which per vades them. Even the divines most con spicaons for their uncompromising hos tility to slavery have wisely abstained from any expression calculated to deepen the animosity between different sections of the country. The clergy have set a wise and beneficent example of conciliation which can hardly fail to be productive of a soothing influence upon the time. Thx election of Mr. Jefferson as Presi dent in the year 1800, frightened many - very worthy people. A correspondent of the Xational Intelligencer, who remembers the excitement sixty years ago, says it was then contended that Mr. Jefferson's elec tion would dissolve the Union; our coun try would bo overrun with paupers and criminals from other countries; our reli gion would be destroyed, our churches closed and Bibles burnt. None of these - occurred. Tht writer adds?"Mr; Jcffer son proved to be one of our most popular Presidents, the rights of each State pro tected, no churches closed and no Bibles tfarnt. Such, I dare believe, will be the course of Mr. Lincoln; and if I do not greatly err in my judgement, he will prove to be one of the safest and best Presidents we ever had." Comobess meetB to-day, but there will not, we presume, be anything of import ance done beyond the appointment of a committee to inform the President ot their readiness to proceed with the public busi ness. The President's Message, it is ex pected, will be sent in to-morrow, and, provided there is no unusual delay, will reach us Wednesday forenoon.

Washington, Thursday, Nov. 29. Quite a large number of Western mem bers of Congress eamc in, this evening, and are already busily discussing the prospects ahead. They all declare for pacification, whatever may be the sacri fice. Tho tone of sentiment in Virginia has ovidentl? taken another turn. In Mr. Gnrnett's District, as well as several oth ers, conservative resolutions have been passed almost unanimously, and the ob ect of those urging Gov. Letcher to fix an early day for the assembling of the Legis lature, was to have an expression ot con servative sentiments before tbe meeting of the South Carolina Convention. Gov. Letcher refused, saying' '-Let South Caro lina go?she will be no loss to tho Union." After all the talk about members refus ing.to take seats, it is understood that the Soutli Carolina delegation will present themselves, at least long enough to pocket their back pay and mileage, provided there bo any money in tbe Treasury with wliich to pay them, which is now exceed ingly doubtful.

In order to ascertain from bis own lips Mr. Lincoln's policy, be visited him at bis residence in Springfield. Mr. Lincoln inforined him that he was opposed to any interference with -slavery in the States, or with the inter-State slave trade; that he was "op posed to abolishing or interfering with ] slavery in the District of Columbia; and : that he was only opposed to its extension in the Territories, but added "that was only an opinion of his/' He was then asked what would be do in the event that Sonth "Carolina sccejled from the Union? He replied that he would let her' go if Congress did not pass a "force bill." He stated that if no one would accept office in that State, of conrse, they, could receive no benefit from the Government, and the whole expense for the distribution of the mails would devolve on her own citizens. He concluded by advising the Mississippian to purchase rs many "negroes as be needed; and expressed the opinion that, in twelve months, slave property wonld be worth more than it ever had been. Upon these assurances the gentleman was, on Satarday, making bis way to Vir ginia to purchase more negroes. He says that Lincoln is a man of profound acquire ments, and that he doubts not will make as good if not better President than Mr. Buchanan has done.?Chattanooga Gazette. Lord. Palmeriton on the Prince's Visit. At a public banquet in London, Lord . Palmcrston thus alluded to the reception of the Prince of Wales.iu America :* ? "You have alluded to an event which has awakened the deepest interest in the mind of every Englishman. I mean the visit of the Prince of Wales to the North American Continent. It was to be ex pected that when the future hope of Eng land visited the subjects of Her Majesty in our North American Provinces he would be received with that enthusiastic affection which becomes a loyal and attached peo ple. Our anticipations have not been dis appointed. The reception of the Prince has been worthy of the people who gave it, and honorable to the family of which be is so distinguished a member; and we may hope that that visit may cement more closely those tics which, I trust, are long destined to bind together that portion of the Queen's dominions and the ? mother country. [Hear, hear.] But Jre bad not an equal right to expect that when his Royal Highness visited the Uuited States he would be received with anything more than the courtesy which civilized nations accord to distinguished members of the reigning family of another country. But I must say it has been most gratifying to wituess the cordiality, the heartfelt kind ness, the generous hospitality, and 1 may say, the enthusiastic delight, with which that illustrious Prince was welcomed by our cousins in the United States. [Cheers.] They have shown themselvas, indeed, to be a noblo and gcuerous' people?they have shown that thsy have not forgotten the common stock from which they and we have sprung; and, in spile of events which if not buried in oblivion, might have pro duced some slight alienation between us, they received our future Sovereign?and I trust that future may be long distant? they received the eldest son of our gracious Sovereign, not as if he were a stranger belonging to another land, but as if be had been born in their own country, and . had been a citizen of their own Republic. [Cheers.] I trust, gentlemen, that the remembrance of the generous kiudness thus exhibited br the people of the United Slates will ever be cherished by the peo ple of these kingdoms. I believe the memory of the Prince's visit will long sur vive in the breasts of the American na tion, and that these mutual recollections will tend more closely than ever to knit together those two great branches of the same noble and, I will say, illnstrious stock. [Cheers.]
