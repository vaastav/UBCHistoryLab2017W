Great City of Trias Iho Papr Jlllb Tho tonio effect on real estate exerted by the securing of the grand hotel was apparent yesterday It is felt that values on Muin and Houston street property have been more firmly fixed than ever by the success of the hotel undertaking and as a consequence there was considerable talk of dealing in lots on the two streets To cover eight vacant 1 lots with a magnificent structure is no I small thiug It takes 11 half block off J the market to permanently im I prove it and thnt nlono I adds hundreds of dollars to the other vacant property on the streets named Now if the work ou tho city hall and government building were pushed values would be still farther in creased Not only Is the holder of real property benefited but the merchant must see that with the work undr way on buildings to ost over Si000000 trade will be increased to n considerable ex tent Closing the hotel deal was a big thing lor Fort Worth A PLAN OF CIMrAIGN Fort Worth is engaged iu a contest for supremacy and it is not ouly necessary that her citizens bo milled m their ef forts but equally us important that they know just wnrt they wish to do und have a well defined plan of campuigu to ac complish the desired object there must be real estate dealing und it must be prolltnble Suburban 1 ind ana town lots must be sold to outsiders unit must change bauds at home be fore there can bo general improve ment of this property The lirst thing then that would result from nn approved plan of campaign to bud 1 n city out of Fort Worth would be activity iu real es tate Tho next thing must be nn era of building All things Indicate at the present time that during the year of 1891 buildings to aggregate in cost S3000000 will be erected and completed This sum will probably be increased and should be It should be part of the citys plan ot campaign to mnke this amount 3000000 before 1892 rolls arouud This building will be 11 necessity Fort Worth needs more store buildings nnd needs n number of very fine store buildings It should be mude the study of the chamber of commerce to secure for the people of Fort Worth cheaper money to be used iu improving property A united nud systematic ef fort on the part of the financiers ot tho chamber of commerce would bring this about The city couucil of Fort Worth should map out u generous sys tem of public improvements which should bo pushed The council should not only expend tho publlo money in publio Improvements but should cause good sidewalks and miles of them built by Individualproperly owners Tho latitude in this respect should not be too great A gravel side walk for twentylive feet a rough stone for twentyfive feet n brick walk for twentyflvo feet a dressed stone for twentvSve feet 11 cement walk for

securing more wholesale houses and by building railroads to unoccupied territory Fort Worth people shoul I in the next twelve mouths contribute of their wealth 500 000 to make them 10000000 richer
