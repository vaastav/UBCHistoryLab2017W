The' Chaplain, December 1. were la their fell at twelve in hia opening prayer, alluded feelingly to the deaths of Senator Anthony, Secretary Folger and Representatives Evans and Duncan. He Implored that in the new era they were entering upon the only sectional rivalries might be in paths of progress. Senator Gorman's desk was banked up hljjh witb flowers. Floral roosters of elab orate denlgn towered high above his head. One bore tbe inscription i "Oh, such a day so fought, so followed and so lairly won, came not till now to decorate the times since Casar's fortune." An other design ornamenting this particular desk was, "Unserved for A. P. 0.. 1887." A third rooster of flowers decorated the desk of Senator Jonas. Senator Maxey had an immense lone star. Senator Lap ham beamed from behind a huge horse shoe of smilax; and the desks of the Vice President and of Senator Ingalis and others, bore beautiful floral tributes. Senator Logan was early In bis seat, and moved a formal resolution to notify the House of Representatives, which Senator Sherman followed by a resolu tion to notify tbe President. Tho credeuttals of William II. Sbcllled, as Senator-elect from Rhode Island lu place of Senator Anthony, were read, but Sheffield was not present.

As early as half past ten o'clock tho galleries of the House of Representatives begau Ailing up, and long before the hour of opening every seat was filled and all standing room was taken. Crowds clus tered around each doorway and for some distance Into the corridor. Many desks of members, as well as that of tbo Speak er, bore floral tributes in tho shape of baskets, horseshoes, etc. Mr. Murpby (of Iowa) had an elaborate horseshoe bearing the word "Hennepin." as a compliment for his effort in behalf of the Hennepin Canal enterprise.

President's Message, VTashwotok, V. 0., December l.-Preul-diit Arthur's annual message was transmit ted to Congress to-day. At the out-sot tbe President refers to ttie reoont political con tost, which rosulted In Prosldont Cleveland's lection. He remarks that U Is a subject of general congratulation that after the con troversy, despite the closeness of tbo vote, the publlo peaoe suffered no disturbance, but pooplo awaited the result patlontly and quietly. Nothing could more strikingly II instrate tbe temper ot the American eltlaen, ami bin loyalty to law, nor more signally demonstrate tho strength and iroodotu of ur political Institutions. Our relations with all foreign powers continue amluablo. Tbe Congo question Is commented on as one of great International importance. Tho rich prospootlve trade of the Congo Valley leads to the conviction that it should bo open to all nations ou euual terms. Tbe noeossary legislation to make effootlve the Mexican commercial treaty la recom mended aa one of tho Unit measures to claim attention from Congress. Tho Nlcaraguan treaty, recently conolud-. od, which authorises the con. traction of a eanal and railway by the Han Junn and Lake KlvaraKua route, tho President believes, will ouiraand univernal approval at home and abroad.

He rnpws his recommendations of 1KJ fa voring the abolition of all eiolse taxes except those relating to distilled spirits., If the.e taxes ure abolished the' revenue remaining to the (Jovernnien, will not onlysuitlco to meet all reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduotion as may seem ad lsahle when the results of recent revenue laws and com mercial treaties shall have shown In what quarters these reductions can be most Judi ciously effected. . . The lYesldont says, although" he Is fully sensible to the objuctlons to .be made to the appointment of a Commission to ascertiilQ the must effective means for Increasing our foreign trade, still he believes this to be the most speedy and efficient method.' He In dorse, the recommendation of tbe Hw rotary of tho Troasury, favoring liberal subsidies to mall steamship lines as an Incentive to the Investment of America! capital In American steamships, and declares that unless that course be pursued the foreign carrying trade will remain, as It la to-day utmost exclusively In the hands of foreigners. , . ' On the subject of a basis for Nntlonal bank circulation be says: Three percent, bonds of the Government to an amount of more than a hundred million have since my lat annual message been redeemed by treasury bonds; tbe Issue still outstanding amounts to a lit tle over two bun lred .tillona, about one fourth of which will be retired tbrongb tbe operations of the sink ng fund during tbe coming years. As tuese bonds still oontlnue tbe chief basis tor tbo circulation of Na tional banks, the question bow to avert the contraction of tbe currency caused by their retirement is one of constantly increasing importance. It seems to be generally cou ceded that tbo law governing this matter ex acts from tbe banks excessive security : that upon tbeir present bond depoaito a largur circulation than is now allowed may bo granted with safety. I hope tbe bid which f leased tbe Senate laat session permitting tho ssue of notes equal to the full value of tbe deposited bonds will commend Itself to tbo consideration of tho House oflj Representa tives. 

COAST DKVEKSitg. Concerning tbe seaboard defenses for our cities, ret-vuimended by the beeretary of War, he says: "The time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abor tive. When the possible result of delay In making such preparation is seriously con sidered, the delay seems Inexcusable, tor tue most Important cities, those whose de struction or capture would be a National hu miliation, adequute defenses, inclusive of guns, may be made by the gradual .expendl- , ture of ,Ouo,000, a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribu tion. The appropriation of about one-tenth of that amount is assed to begin the work, and I concur with tne Secretary of War In urging Hi at it be granted. . He renews the recommendation contained In his special message to the last Congress, favonug the establishment ot two Govern ment lactones one lor the army and one for the uavy for tho manu.ac-ture of heavy steel cannon, and urges Congress to act, so aa to enable the Government to construct its own ordnance on Its own territory, and pro vide tbe armaments demanded by consider ations of National salety aud honor. Concerning the reconstruction ol the Navy he says: "In tuts, the last of the stated mesxages I shall have the Honor to transmit to Comcress, I ean not too strongly urge on Its attention the dutv at rrxiorini tiio Navy as rapidly as possible to the high state of ellicicucy wuich formerly characterized it.

The President devotes much apace to the consideration of tue policy of tue Govern ment rewarding the extension of our foreign trade. Tue mam conditions of the problem are thus stated.

Judge Key of the United States District Court has fined a number of illicit dls' tillers In the term just closed. Several "Moonshiners" have been lined and sent to prison for thirty days. It la very noticeable that the rigorous warfare Inaugurated against "moonshiners" sev eral years ago has suppressed much of the Illegal traffic, and some of the most notorious dUtlllers have given up . the business forever. Five or six years ago there were at every term of tho Court several hundred cases on the docket, bat the number of trials now la very small and Is constantly decreas ing. One of the most celebrated dis tillers of other days Is now ln the revenue service, and does excellent work lor the Government. Alarmed Sugar Planters. New Ot leans, La., December 1.
