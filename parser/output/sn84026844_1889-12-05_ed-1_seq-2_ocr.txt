Thia work doua not enter the field to dispute it with any predecessor. It haa had no predecessor aud can have no rival. From tho geographical knowledge of tho undents concerning thia conti nent down to the close of the Mexican War the whole wide reach ia covered in every detail that can have interest for the geueral reader and tho special student. Kvery chapter haa ita historical narra tive aud ita critical essay,and, of infinite value, the aourcea from which the ma terial is drawn. These sources embrace all there is of American historiography. The critical essay is a feature which can not bo too highly commended aa u new departure iu historical literature. it is to tho honor of the editor, aa it will he his enduring distinction. t*at he preferred to bo the editor, ratuer than attempt to he tho writer, of thia tcoiiu mental work. Each subject is treated by n specialist, so that we have reuson to behove that we ure getting the very best that learning can give on each point.
