TLo President's nieiirtnr,o to Con green which was road at noon yes? terday to thnt body Is marked prin? cipally by Its length. Tutore Is In the document a mass Cf wo.ds thai la nl moit staggering and bei little that Is now. Fearful that the message would not bo marked by Its length, the President quotes whole pages full of the document lie rent to Conp.iosr. last year, and the total result Is over thirty thousand words. The Presi? dent':! opening Is most patriotic and has the tlngo ofcia Fourth of July ora? tion! Ho dwells at some length upon lie-- resourcoti of this nation and point1:, out the well-known truth that, there Biro, opportunities In plenty to bo dis? honest. "Successful dishonesty," as' tho President puts it, snoiild bo warred against until It Ii entirely done away with In the United States. Ho ndmllll that, there perhaps may bo persans who do not r.greo with his policy of oxtcrmtnat'-on of tho "successful ills honrnt" man, but asks Congress to go at the (ask with an unillucblng porseverancc. As ho has; roptatdly said before tho Proa I dent behoves there iu only cue way to curb the big corporations, and that in by federal control. Ho innlr. tains that the control of the trusts ami railroads can be glvou over to tho federal government without further legislation, a;: there are already law's giving that power. He says on this question that the federal government iu in no noci of an extension of pow? er, bnit that it is time for an exten? sion of activity. Ho usos his well worn argument that the centralizing . of business can bo only coped with by centralized power. In other words, ho would have the states have noth? ing t; say relative to the control of a c, rporhtftm with an interstate hur.i ncijH, As tbi.-. recommendation Is the very leador of the message, it is a noir evident fact that the President regards tho complete abolishment of . states' lights one of the leading ques tibhn of tho hour. Again ho shown that not sltico tlio days of Hamilton lias the centralization Idea had such nn ardent advocate as it now lias in Proddent Roosevelt, but as much as Mr. Roos?volt wants this favorite eehemo carried cut. it will bo a long time before the majority of Congress will agree with him in his unsound ;' views on this question. Thore is hardly a subject treated in tho now mossago with: ' o'^t the words, "orte oC my for? mer messages," cr "as I have repeatedly said before," and >t Is so with his remarks on tho Slier ? man antitrust law. As has boon fore caotod by the correspondents in JVashington, tlio Prealdout docs not oik for the repeal of the Sherman law, bm c;r elaborate amendments. Ho wants it nioro effective and mado tip that it suits tbo conditions of the tlu.o letter. Iu thld tho President ts rieht. Tho Sherman law is not . ofliciont; it has outgrown itself. When It was cnactrHl it seemed to cover the ground fully, but. tho consolidations jf the corporations have become ho great and tho trust.-' of tntch magni? tude, that tho law uo langer eovoro tb? Situation lu u satisfactory iutin nur. Out while discussing thin sub j Jcct, iio goes out of bin way to say Hint all -amendments made nliould Ik* so that tbo power bo given t,> tho national gov? ernment, not to tho states, anil lu doing so, Mr. Roosevelt makes what appears to us d very weak argu, tnout tind olio not worthy of tho pages of tho animal message of u President of the 1'nltod States to Congress, He make- the claim that governmental supervision over a big corporation will malto It ?iifor and says: "in tho recent busluosa crisis It in noteworthy that the Institutions which failed wore institutions which woro not tin '.!> ??? the supervision ami control of Dm national government Those which woro Under national control stood tho teat." There can bo only c-ne point to Iho argument of the president on this question, and 11 Is that the reason why corporations would bo better otr un.W governmental control, would bo because of Iho aid that would be glv on to them. Castiug aside (he nonsensical statement that gov? ernmental control win make a trust safer, let tin for n mo? ment take up tho 'assertion ho makes about the banks. Ii Is true that In New York Iho tanks that went to tho wall woro not national banks, but If tho truth were told, there wore na? tional banks in New York city nt that lima which wero In Just ns precarious a condition Ca those which went to tho wall', but which worn saved by outside and purely BOlflsh lnflucne?s. The President falls, it might be well to remark, to state that there were a number of national bank failures outside of New York city which woro working under a governmental char? ter. The whole statement and argu? ment or tho President in thin portion of. tho message Is so fallacious that It Is really not worth considering in a serious light. Wo would, however, ask any sane or sensible person if ho believes that It would be wife lor' tlio federal rjoverurucnt tj aid a. trust; or a railroad or any largo corporation In n financial manner every time It might happen to bo In distress? The President urges Congress to glvo Us attention to tho question of a greater elasticity lu our currency laws and suggests that. It might be well to investigate the matter of bank directors loaning money to them? selves, and while ho admits there is a great need to prevent marginal gambling, though bo does not call It that ho Bays be cannot see how it can Ui entirely prevented. While be does not directly defend the methods of Wall street he does so Indirectly, and makes no re^rnmondationa to Congress on the subject- whatever. It Is true that the solution of this prob? lem h; a moat diuicult one, but it is a disappointment that President Ilcosovolt, tlio man who Is supposed to ho tho poesospor or tho highest sort of ideal, rhould so utterly neglect this all Important question In his mos-j sago. Perhaps he will later on give Congress and tlio country at largo bin vieWg on the subject lu a special message. Let us hone 60 anyway. I Of coursp the tariff question re? ceived the scantiest sort of consider? ation. The president by his mega? phone taetU-i hud announced that ho did not believe- the tariff should be touched until after tho presidential election, and that is exactly what ho says in his message. Tho Democrats cannot runotid tho Dingle} law, but they can come close to having tho Republican party place Itself on re? cord, and that Is what the people want I next to having tho law Itself amended. I lie takes a gloomy view on the question of having clean and -well eon. ! ducted campaigns. He says that evils exist, but believes that .It will take a long time to correct them. In ?in I or words, he does not desire to have them corrected until ho Is sure thai j lie. is no longer vitally Interested. There are a whole lot of Other . things di?cu??Od in tho mcsrago which ireiterate tho President's well-known views on tho subjects in qucs'ion. . The hiossage as a w'ijoL\ is u disap? pointment. -?^i- ..1 1 THE
