FROM THE FORTY FIRST REGIMENT. CAMP NEAR NASHVILLE Nov. 27th, 1862. Frieno Convkrsk: Hero wo aro, ''way down lo Tennessee." Wa aro, at prosont. encamped about four mile, loulh oast of Naihvillo, on thn piko leading from Nnsli rille to Mitrlrootboro. We camo horo yu. lorday. How long wo shall stay I cannot lay, but, judging Trim tho preparation. mado In encamping, 1 should think wo would probably remain hero until tho forward rpovnmenl i. mudo by iho Grand Army of tho Cumberland, and, when that movetnont i. made, I think Robeldoai will feel tho shock lo it. very center. Tho army I. boing put under a rigorous discipline, ( Hung I which is o.aontiul to its efuciancy.) and con fldonee and hopo are boiug inspired in of ficer, and men, that, under tho command of Qcn. Koiicrnni, the Army of tho Cum berland will bo able to do their,. Iiaro In cru.hing thi. gigantic Rebellion, and that poedily. Wbat tho numbor of ironp. i., who are encamped in and around Nashville, I am un ablo to aay ; but tho Holds in nearly avory direction, (whoro thoro i. water.) aro cov ered with soldiers' cloth houses, anil the road, crowded with Government wagon.. At for the health of tho army, I bolioro It is considered good. Tho health of thi. Regl moni is good. Companies B and G, from Goauga, havo but fuw in on in the hospital. A. for the officers commanding Co.. R and G, allow mo to tay to Ihnso whn have friindi with u, that no belter officers than Capt. Munn, of Company i, and Llout. E. A. Ford, commanding Company B. are in tho service ; and that tho want, ol Iho in on will be looked to and rogtirdod, so far as Ihey are concorneu. 1 wrote you whilo at Ola.gnw, Ky. We left that place the 1 2th of Novombur, en rout for Nashville. Afiarfour day.' march, we encamped in Tennu.soo, a fuw mile, south of Gallatin, at a plnco called Silver Springs Wo remained ihmo a few days, and then marched one day, oncamping .ov en mile, cast of JNa.hvillo, whore wo re mained nearly one week, and then inarched to thi. place, which i. about lour miles We did not march through Nashville, but camo io sight of tbo Stato liouio. Too new reoruit. stand it won, and aro fan becoming .oldieri. Although onduring soma hardships. Ihoir loyalty and patriot ism remain firm. The boys are saying that ll is Thanksgiving Day to day, in Ohio. But il will not do to think of iho tuppors which will bo enjoyed therO to day. So C. P. B. How California was Saved. Tt bas transpired that the rebel General Albert Sidney Johnson, killod ot Sbiloh, ooncertod a nice plan to po.sots Ilia socess loni.t. of California at tbo boginnlng of tho rebollion. tie was in command nl can Fraaoisco. At a given time the seeosilonists wero lo tako the forts at bis connivinoe, and seize C0.000 stand of arms shipped there by iloyd for toe Tory purpose, ban I ran okco, at Ihoir mercy, must have succumbod and the rebels would thus bare bad a port in wntcn lo lit out priva.ooia, and would likewise have ohtairiod cntitrnl of the vast treasure of Ibe Stato. The fact was oithor koown or susprotod at Washington. ' Briga dier General E. V. Sumner was appoiuled to mo command in calitoroia, and was privily put on board ship at sea, arriving in San Francisco without previous intimation of bis coming. He walked, incognito, lo the office of Johnson, informed him that he wa. his successor, showed him his papers, ar.d demanded immediate possession. The as tonished rebel had no alternative but to comply. In half an hour after, all tho guns on the" forts woro run eut on Ilia land side and heavily shottod. Tbo same evening, ibe 60,000 stand of arms at Benioia were secured. This brilliant but quiet coup if tlat saved the El Dot ado Stato. On Swikt TiMPga. "I cannot forbear pointmg out to you, my dear child," said General Jackson once to a young lady, in whose welfaiK he fell a dtep interest, "the great advantages that wilt result from a tercperata conduct and sweetness of man tier lo all people, on al ocoasiona. Nrfver forget that you are a gentlewoman. And air your woids and actions should" make you e mle. ' I never heard your mother your dear, good mother say a harsh or nasty ining io any peaaoa in my We. En deavor to imitate her. I am auick and hasty in my temper, but it is a misfortune, wnicn, not navtog been aumoieoily re trained in my youth, baa eaused me in ezpiessible pain. It has given me more trouble to subdue this impetuosity than anvthiog I ever undertook." The President's Message on Emancipation. tion. On the 22d dny of Soptombnr last,, proc lamation was issuod by Iho Exeaulivo, a copy of which Is herewith submitted. In accordance with the purposes expressed in tho.ccnnd paragraph or that paper, 1 now ro.pi'dfully recall your attention to what may bo callod "oompfltisetud emancipation." A nation may bo said in consist oi it. ter ritory, it. pooplei, il. laws. The lorrilory I. of certain durability, "One generation passoihaway andanothorgetiuratimi eomoih, hut Iho earth abidetb fnre-ui." Il i. of tho first import. nco lo duly con.idor and o.ii malo tins never-ending part. Thai portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhnliilud by tho people of tho Uoitod Statos, is well adapted to Iho home of one national family, and il is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast oxtont, and its variety of cliinato and productions, are of advantage In Iho ago of our pooplo, what ever Ihay might have boon in forinor age. 8toam, and tulogroph.. and inlolligenco, have brought those to be an advauragoou. combination for ono united people. In the Inaugural Address I briefly pointed out tho total inadequacy of disunion a. a remedy for diffnrrnens holwcen the pooplo of the two soctinl s. 1 did so in laugu.go which I cannot improvo, end which, there fore. I bog to repeat. Ono lection of our country belioves sla very is right aud ought to be extended, whilu tho olhor beliuvos it is wrong and ought not to ho extended. This is tho ouly substantial dispute. Tho fugitiro slave clause of the Constitu tion and iho law for tho suppression of the African slave trade, aro each as woll en forced, perhaps, as any law can ever ho in a community where the moral senso of tho people iuiporfectly supports Ibe law itself. Tbo great body of the penplo abide by the legal obligations in both cases, and a few biottk ovr each. This. I think, cannot bo perfectly cuied, and it would be worso in both instance, after .oparalioo of the see lions than bofmo. Tho foreign slave trado. now imperfectly stinnrcsstd. would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, whilo fugitives, now only partially surrendered, would not bo surrendurod at all by Iho other. t'hvsicnlly speaking, wo cannot io pn rate. We cannot remove our respective ections from each other, nor build an inv passablo wall between I hem. A husband and wifo may he divorced mid go out of the prosenco and bHvnud tho rcaoh of each other, but tho different pans of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain fuco to faco, and intercourse, either ftmicablo or hostilo, must continue botwoon tbom. Is If pnnible.thon, to make that intercourse more advanta geous or more satisfactory afior separation tnan Deioro .' uan aliens innao iroauus easier than friend, can mnko law. ? Can Iroatic. be moro faithfully onfnrootl botwoon aliena than law. can among friends ? Sup pose you go to war, you cannot fight always. anil wnun, alter muon iobb un uon siuve and no eain on cither, you cease fighting the Identical old question, as lo torun of intercourse nro again upon you. Thore is no lino, straight or crooked, suitablo for a national boundary, upon which to divide Traco through from oast to west, upon iho line botwron the free and slavo country, and we shall And a litllo more than ono third of its length aro rivers easy to be crossed, and populated, or sonn lo bo popul.tcd, thickly upon both sides, whilo In nearly all Its romatnlng length aro merely survoyors' lines, ovur which penplo may walk back and forth without any con loiou.iirss of thoir pro.onco. No pari of this lino can bo made any more dimoult to pa, by writing it down on paper or parch ment as a national boundary. Tho fact of separation, if il com os. gives up on Iho purl of tho seooding section the fugitivu slavo clauso, along with all othor constitutional obligations upnn iho section seceded from, while I should expect no tronlv stimulation would evor bo mado to take its place. But thoro Is another d'fSoulty. The groat interior region, bounded oast by Iho Alleghunies, north by the British dominions, west by Iho Rocky Mountains, and south by tho lino along which Iho cultivation of corn and cotton moots, and which includes part of Tonuoison, all Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Minnesota, and tho Territories of Da notah, Nebraska, and a part of Colorado, have above ten millions of pooplo, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, if not prevented by any political folly or mistuke. It contains more than ono-tbird of tbe country owned by the revolted States, cer tainly moro than one million of surface miles; ono half as populous a. Massachu setts already is, it would hnve more than soventy-flve millions of people. A glance at tho map shows that, territorially speak ing, is tbe great body of Iho Ropublio The other parts are but marginal borders lo it, tho magnificent region slnplng west from tho Rocky Mountains lo Ihu Pacific, being the deonest and also tne richest in undeveloped resources in tbe production of provisions, gra ns, grasses, and all which proceed, from thetu. This groat Interior region is naturally one ot tne most Import ani in the world. Ascertain from tbo sta tislica tho small proportion of Iho region which has not as yol been brought Into cul tivation, and also tbo large and rapidly in creasing amount of Its products, and wo shail be ovorwhelmod with the magnitude of the prospects presented, and yet this ro gloo has no seaeonsl, touches no ocean any where. As part of ono nation Its penplo now may f lid, and may forever Hod Ihoir way, to Europo by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Fraooiico. But separate our common country Into two potions, as designod by tho present rebellion, and ovory man in this great In terior region Is thereby cut off from some ono or wore of theso outlots, not perhape by a physioul barrier, but by embarrassing sod onerous trade regulations, and tbis is true wherever a dividing or boundary lioe may be fixed. Place it botween the "now free and slavo country, or placo it south of Kentucky, or norm ot unto, and still tbe truth remains Ibat none ' south of It can trade to any port or plaoe north of it, and none north of it can trade to any port or plaoe south or it, except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west and soulb, are indispensa ble to tbe well being of the people inhabit ing, and to inhabit, tbis vast interior re gion. Which of tbe tbree may be tbe best is no proper question I all are butter than either, 'and all of righl belong lo .bat people and lo their successors forever, true to themselves, tboy will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but avill vow rather that there shall not be any snob line. Nor are the marginal regions lots interested I thcio communications to and through thorn to tho great outside world. They do, and each one of thorn must havo sccoss In thoir Egypt of iho west, without paying toll at iho crossing of any national boundary. Our national strife .priogs not from our purnianont pari, not from tho lands we In habit, not from our national homestead. There is no possihlo swerving of ibis hut would multiply and not mitigate nvils among us. In all It. adaptation, and alti tudes, it domands Utiinu and a'jhois sepa ration.

Any Slalo baring received bonds as aforesaid, and afterwards, introdu cing or tolerating slavory therein, shall ro tund to the Unitod States tho bonds so re ceived, or tho valuo thereof, and all iutereat paid thoreon. Article. All slavos who shall havo enjoyed actual freedom by tho chances ot tbo war, at any time before tho end ef the rebollion, shall bo forever free, but all owners of such, wbo shall not have beon disloyal, shall be compensated for thorn at the same rales a. i. provided for States adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such a way Ihat no slavo shall bo twieo accounted lor. Article. Congress may approprialo mon ey, or nthorwiso provido fur colonizing fieo colored persons with their own consent, at any placo or places within tho United States I beg indulgonco to discuss theso proposed artiolo. at somo length. Without slavery tho rebollion should never have existed. Without slavory it could not continue. Among the friends of the Union Ihore is groat diversity ol sentiment and polioy in regard lo slavery and tho.Alricau raoo amongst us. somo would abolish it sud denly ond without compensation. Some would abolish it gradually and with com ponsaiinn. Somo would romove Iho freo people from us, and somo would rotuin them with us. and there aro yet othor minor diversities. Becauso of those divursities we wasto much strength in struggles amongst ourselves. By mutual concession wo should harmonize and act togotbor. This would be a coinpromlio among tho Inonds and not with the enemies of tho Union. These article! are intoodod to embody a plan ot such mutual concession. If the plan shall bo adopted it is anumod Ibat emancipation will follow, at least, in several of Iho Stales. In the first article the main points aro first, the emancipation ; second, the length of lime for contueTimatiiig 37 years; and third, tbo compensation. The emancipa lion will be unsatisfactory lo Iho advocates of porpoluat slavery ; bat tbo leugth of time should greatly iiiitigalo their dissatis faction. . Tbe time savos both races from the evils of auddon dorangumont, in fact, from tho necessity of aoy dorangement; whilo most of those whoio habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measuro, will have passed away boforeits consumma tion tboy will nover aeo it. Another olas. will bail tbo prospect of emancipation.- but will deprocato tho length of time. Tbey will feol that il giv)s loo little lo the now living slaves; but it really gives them much. It saves thcin from Iho vagraot destitution whioh must lurgoly attend immediate eman cipation, in localities whore ihoir uumbors are vury groat, and it giro, tho inspiring assu.eucu that ihoir posterity sbsll be free forever. Tho plan leavos to each Stato choosing to act under it, lo abolish slavery now or at tbo end of Iho conlury or at any intermediate timo, or by degrees extending over tbe wholo or any pari of that period, and It obliges t.o two Statos lo proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and gen erally the modu of making it. This il would seem, must further mitigate tbe dis satisfaction of thoio wbo favor perpetual slavery, cspocially those who are to recoive coinpunitttioo. Doubt lust some of those who are to pov and oot lo roooive will ob ject. Yet tbat the measuro I. both just aod economical is corlatn, l ne liberation ot me slaves is the destruction of property ao quired by descent and by purchase, the aaino as any olhor property. 1 1 is no loss true for having buou often said, Ihat the peoplo of tbo South are no more responsible lor tho introduction of this property than aro tbe pooplo of Ibe North, aod when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and share lbs profits of dealing m thorn, it may nol no quite sate to say that tho South has" boon more responsi ble tbaq tbo North for Its continuance. If then, for a common object, tbis property is it not lust that it bo doue at a ootiioioo charge ? And if with loss money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the bone- fits of tbe Union by this nieaus than we oan by tbe, war alone, is it not eeouomioal lo do it? Let us consider it then. Lot us ascer tain tbe sum we have expended in Ibe war, sibce compensated emancipation was pro posed last March, and ooosidor whother if that measure had boen promptly acoepted by even some of the stave Statos, the same sum would not have done moro lo elose the war than bas been otherwise done. If so, the measuro would save money, and in that view, would be a prudent ana economical moasure certainly. It is not sotoasy to nay , U IIT something it is to pay nothing but It easior to pay a largo som than It It to pay a larger one, and it Is easier to pay any sum when we are able, than il it to pay It before we are able. Tbe war requires tbem at once. Tbe .eereeato turn neeeasarv for compensated emancipation of oourie would try , be largo, but II would require no i e idy cash nor bondman, any fastor tbe emancipation progreiso. Tin. might not, and probably would not clo.o before the end of tho thirty even year.. At thai lime we .hall probably have 100.0(10 000 people lo share the burden Instead of 31,100. 000 as now ; and not only an, but Iho Increase ot our population may bo otpectod lo conttnuo for a long time afior the period as rapidly as boforo, becauio our lorrltotics will not have become full. I do not stato this inconsidoratoly. At tho same ratio of increase which we havo maintained on an nvorage from oar first ns tinned coniu. in 1790 until ihat of 1SG0, we should.

Instoad of recoiting Iho foreign born as now, wo should he compollud to send part of tho native born away; but suoh Is not our condition. We havo 3.063.000 iquare miles. Europo has 8.800 0o. with a pop ulation averaging 73 1-8 person to the iquaro mile. wny may not our country, at some timo, avMrago as many Is it loss fertile ?

This shows sn average docimal incjoaso of 34 CO 100 cent, in population through iho seventy yoai a from our first lo our li.st census luken. It is seon that tho rulio of incronso at no ono of these seven periods is either two per cunt bolow or two pur cunt ahovo tho av erage; thus showing how infloxiblo, and consequently how rsliablo, tho law, of in crease in our caso is. Assuming tbat il will cnnlinuo' it gives ho following rosults; 1870. 4'J 323.372; 1880, 66 9G6 21G ; 1890, 78 677 872 ; 1000,103 208 415 ; 1010,133. 918 626 ; 1920, 150,034,336 ; 1030, 251, 080 814. Tlieso figures show ibat our country may bo as populous as Europo, at somo point botwoon lUJUand 1U3U say about 1926 our territory, at 731 to the squaro mile, Doing ot Iho capacity to conlaiu 217,166,- 000 ; and wo will reach this. too. if wo do not ourselves rolinnui-h the chances by tbe folly and evils of disunion, or by long, ox haustlng war, springing from the only great eicmom oi otscoru among us. Wlnloil can not bo forescon exactly hnw much one huge example of soccssion, breeding lessor ones in deflnitelv, would retard the pnpulnlion.civili- zation and property, no ono can doubt that mo extont or it would bo vory groat aad In jurious. I no proposed emancipation would shorten this war ; porpetuato peace; insure this m crease lu population, and prnperllonably too increase in ttio wealth of tbo eonntrv With this wo should pay all that emancipa tion would cost, withput our other dolls oasior than wo should pay our othor dobts without it. If we had allowed our old na tional dubls lo run at 6 por cool por annum, simple interest, from tho ond of our revo lutionary struggle till to-day without paying anything on either principal or interest, each man of us would owo loss on that debt now than oach man owod upon it then, and this bucauio our Incruaso of toon through, tho whole period lias buou greator than 6ix por cent, and lies run fastor than tbo intor est upon the dobt. Thus time bIodo re lieves a debtor nation, so long as its popu lation increases fustur than unpaid interest accumulates on its dubl. This fact would be no excuse for delaying the paymont of what is justly due ; but it shows tbo great importation of limo lo this connection, the groat advantage of a polioy by which wo shall not havo lo pay until wo number 1 00. 000,000, what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when Ibe nuinbur is 31, 000.000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for Iho war, than a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan ; aud thon the tut tor will cost no blood no precious I i to. It will bo a saving of both. As to tho second article, I think it would be impracticable lo return lo bondage tbo class of persons theroin contemplated Some of thorn doubtless, lo tho proporty sense, bolnng to loyal owners, arid bonoo provision is made in this artiolo for com pensating such. The third article relates lo the future of Ibe freed pooplo. It does not ebllgo, bul merely autborixes Congress in aid in coloni zing suoh a. may ooosent. This ought not to bo regarded as objectionablo on the one band or on tho othor, inasmuch as it comes to nought unless by mutual consent of the people lo be dnportod and the American vo ters through ihoir representatives in Con greis. 1 cannot make it bettor koown than il already is ihat I strongly favor coloniza tion, and yet I wish to say that thoro is an objection against the colored persons re maining in tbe country which ia largely im aginary, it not sometimes maiiotou.. ll is insisted that their prosenco would injure and displaee wbito labor and while laborers. If ibere ever eeuld be a propor time for mere arguments, ihat time surely Is hot now. In times like tbe present, men should ut ter nethiog for whioh Ihey would not will ingly be responsible, through time and eter nity. Is it true, iben, that colored people can displace any more wbile labor by being free than remaining slaves i ll tbey alay ia tkeir own piaoea, they jostle no wbile la ir tbey leave their aid placet, tbey tab-rare. Logf- cally. there Is aeitboc more nor lest of it. Emancipation, even without deporta lion, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the' customary lilt have to be performed. The freed people would surely nut do tiioro than their old propor tion of tt, and very probably for a time would do less, leaving an increased part lo whilo laborers, bringing their labor in to grealor demand and consequently en hancing ihe wage ol it. With deportation, even lo a limited ex tent, enhancing wages to while labor is mathematically certain. Libor it like any other commodity in the market in crease the demand Tor it, and you increase tli. price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black la borer out of Ihe country, and by precisely so much you will increase the demand for, and wages for white labor. But it is Jreadcd that the freed people will awarm forth and cover the whole laed. Will liberation make them any more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole country, and there would be but one colored to seven whites, Could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven T There are many communities now, having more than one free colored person to eeven whites, and tbis without any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in Ibis condition. The District hat more ibau one free colored to six whites, and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress, I bc'.ievo it haa never preaenled the pres ence ol free colored persons at ono of its grievtneea. , But why should emaccipnlion south send free people north T People of any color seldom run unless there is something to run from. Heretofore colored people have fled north to some extent from bond age, and now, perhaps from both bond age and destitution, but if gradual emao cipalion and deportation be adopted Ihey will have neither to nee from. 1 hoir own masters will give them wages, at least till new laborers can be procured aad tbe freed men in turn will gladly give their labor for wages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes, and with people of their own blood and race. This proposition can be trueted on tbe mutual interests involved, and in any event cannot the .North decide for itself whether to receive them ? Again, as praclice proves more thao theory in soy case, lint (here been any irruption north ward, because of the abolishment of sla very in Diairiol of Columbia last spring? What I have aaid of the proportion of free colored persons to the white in the Dis trict of Columbia is from the census of 1960, having ns reference to persons called contrabands, nor of those made free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery berc. The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, cot but ihat a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without ut Rdopuoo, nor will the war or proceedings under the proclamation of September 2id, 1663, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely adoption I doubt not would bring restoration and thereby tlay both. And notwithstanding this plan, the recommend ation that Congrest provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt the emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would only be an ad vance part of the plan, and ihe same ar guments apply to bolb. Tbis plan it re commended as a means nol in conclusion of but additional to all other (or restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its econom leaf aspdet. The plan would, I am con Gdent, secure peace more speedily thau could be done by force alone, while it would cost less, considering amounts and manner of payment and times ef payment, and the amounts would be easier paid than will pe the additional cost of the war if wa rely solely upon force. It is moat likely that it would cost no blood al all. The plan is proposed as permanent Constitutional law. It cannot become such without the concurrence, first, of two-thirds of Congress, and afterwards three-fourths of the States, Tbe requi site three quarters of the States wi'.l nec essarily include seven of the Slave Stales. If obtained, il will give assurances ef their severally adopting emancipation at no distant day, upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would end tbe struggle now and save tbe Uuion forever. I do nol forget the gravity of a paper addressed to the Congress of the Nation by the Chief Magistrate of the Nation : nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, or that many of you have more experience than I in ihe conduct of public affairs. Yet, I trust that in view of the great responsibility retting upon me, jou will perceive no want of respect for your selves iu any undue earnestness I may seem to display. Is it doubted, then, tbat the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, aud thus lessen the ex penditure of money and blood ? Is it doubted Ihat it would restore the national prosperity and perpetuate both indefi nitely ? Is it doubted that we here, Con gress and Executive, can seeure its adop tion ? Will not Ihe good people respond to a united and earnest appeal front ns ? Can we can they by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by con cert. It is not can any of us imagine better? but, can any of us do better? Tbe dogmas of the quiet patt are inade quate to tbe stormy present. The occa sion is piled high with difficulty, and wa must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthral ourselves, and then we shall save our country. Fellow ei'.istns, we osnnot eseape his tory. We ot this Congress, will be re membered in spite of ourselves. No per sonal significance or insignificance, can spare one or another of ns. Tbe fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generalion.
