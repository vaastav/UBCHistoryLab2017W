illmeral Point tribune. THURSDAY DEC. 17, 1885. Entered nt the post-office in Mineral Point,U is n> second-class matter. H. & 2. J. EEeNZTT. Editor;. Too nrni is said about the length of President Cleveland’s Message. Ti.e longest part of it, we must rec ollect, is liayard’s, not Cleveland’s. Tnis saw mills of Kau Claire are running in full blast. Ihe idea of running a saw mill in ibis noted frigid country as late as December, is something almost unheard of. I’llekic arc to ho constructed in Wisconsin, during 1 s's(s, about 0.50 miles of railroad, which will proba bly lie increased by the extensions of the Northwestern and Milwaukee it Si. Paul lines to nearly a thousand miles. Tun general feeling at Washing ton is that no business of importance will fie done in Congress until after the holiday recess, and that the Pres ident will make no more removals or appointments at present, unless in eases of actual vacancies. Instead of retrenchment and re duced larstion being the burden of the President's Message and the De partment reports, the most of these documents ask an increase of official salaries. Democratic reform is mostly in the wrong direction. An earnest effort will be made by t Jladslone and his friends to effect an alliance between the Liberals and the Purnellitos in the new .y-elected Rriii>d) House of Commons, and a conference is reported to have been called in London Shortly after New Year’s. Thkuk is a river ir Algeria which the chemistry of nature has turned into ink. The stream is formed by the union of two others, one of which is strongly impregnated with iron, while the other contains gallic acid. The natives use this compound for writing letters and other documents TiikTuhh'Sk was mistaken last week in saying that the county seat of Monroe county had been removed from Spirta to Tomah. On the last day of the regular session of the county board a petition was present ed to suhmit the question to the people; but after six days consulta tion in xtra session, at a cost to the county of g'-'OO, the board decided that the writing of several lur dred names on the petition by one p rson was irregular, and the vote was not Olden and. The Euphrates river in Palestine once a mighty stream, seem likely to disappear altogether. For some years the river banks below Babylon have been giving away so that the stream spread out into a marsh, un til steamers could nut pass, and only a narrow channel remained for the native boa's. Now the passage is being filled up and the prospect is that the towns on the banks will be ruined and the famous river its self will he swallowed no by the* desert. /’c. O- iiKosM \>Trt/tmat?rH; It is said now in Washington that even Mr. Uamlall is preparing a tariff bill which will reduce the revenue thirty millions ef dollars. This is enough to break the camel’s dorsal vertebra. \\ itb no bond call in the past twelve months and the public debt increas ed lour and a half -millions in November, .t looks as though the revenues might t>> i e reduced. Per haps ibis is tlu> only method of dis posing of that enormous surplus in tln~ treasury which Homoc ratio ora toi- nsfd to talk so nur li about. I ' O -tit; The new bill relat ing to pensions to soldo is offered by Senator Ingalls strlkos ;i i ;v gross injustice to the soldier, who is now required by the oeq-arimeni to prove that m- was a sound man and free from disease when he entered the Sewn e. In nine eis< siu ten the examining surg-.iii is dead or out of i'i ii •>/ the ■ l.i. r, or the soldier .in.se'.i lias tor gotten every fact con :sei ’ and with the ' ireumst mcc. As It was .a imperative duty of the ex amining surgeon and the mustering in i is t > enroll only sound men, ibe mu ter rolls at the time should be sufficient to substantiate that fact. There are thousands of old soldiers scattered (i er the land whose wreck- ed health dating from service in the field entitles them to pensions, who hjve been kept upon the rack for years hunting for evidence called (or by the Pension Department, and which they never can obtain. If this ruling of the department is law it is time that it was changed. There is not a living army surgeon but has been appealed to in scores of cases for sworn evidence on this one point who declined to give it because all the facts had gone from his memory. And yet he knew that he never mustered in or entered upon the rolls a diseased man. The 1 ngalls bill should pa.-s. The people of South Dakota are not only extremely earnest in their endeavors to reach the blissful posi tion of statehood, but they arc blas phemously forcible. They propose to adopt as the state motto: “By Clod the People Rule.” The pro faulty looks like a slap at the Demo cratic congress. So far, the deni zens of Dakota have discovered that by congress the people of that terri tory don’t rule. They propose to appeal to a higher power but they have no right to swear about it. —()shkosh Northwestern. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our regular comopondent. w asiiinoion Dee. M, IW. Resides the Forty-Ninth < ongress two others have been in session here during the week. One was a Con gress of doctors, who came to the Capitol to discuss sanitary science. The other was a workingman’s Con gress, a gathering of representatives from both the United States and Canada. Washington is the favor ite rendezvous now, for all kinds of organizations. W ilh tin* parade and demonstrative meetings of the , Tradesmen’s Union, the learned es [ says and lectures of the doctors, are ! the universal interest that is felt in * , our new, hut perennial 1 . S. Con gress, the Capitol lias had no dearth of interest. Washington is in a flourishing condition now, as the banks of the city show, and they furnish a correct i gauge of its business. Prominent ' bankers say their number of new accounts opened recently is larger than iu any previous season. An unusual number of wealthy people are coming in, and bringing money to invest. The result is that there i more money on deposit than ever I before. Hut department clerks this year ‘ will have no money for Christmas ] presents. This is a disappointment Ito both the clerks and merchants ! it is in consequence of a decision of | the disbursing clerks in the various departments not to pay clerks the day before Christmas as of old. Il would involve paying the seven days hi advance under the present custom jol semi-monthly payments. The fi nancial arrangements of many hav ing been made with the expectation that the old custom would lie adher ed to, theie is considerable discon tent. The law forbids an employe re ceiviug Ins salary before services are rendered, though in the past Secretaries have often ordered such payments. 'I lie Foriy-Nii.'li Congress be gins us si com] week of the session wiili tbe Hoar Presidential succes sion bill ready for discussion in the Senate, in the I louse llie absorbing question still, is bow to change the Miles. The Morrison node, which proposes a distribution of the powers of the Appropriations committee, has been adopted in committee and was reported to the House to-day. Peltate upon tiiis plan will begin at once. Mr. Handall antngoniriHi every ehaiige to the old ruli s suggested in i eouunillee and gave notice that lie would eairy bis opposition to the House, He thought such important j ehanges should be considered by a 1 V-timeratie caucus, and asked that , one be called. Speaker Carlisle was 1 of the opinion that it was not a par ;ty qu; ,tion and ought not to he mad one, s.ncn there is great diver sity of opinion upon 'ho subject in both panics. Senators are watching develop ments with regard to a change of rules in the House with much inter cst. Many of them think the propo | silion to distribute the Appiopri* alien bills among several committees an unwise step, and one likely to 1 load to great extravagance. The members of the Senate committee ] on Rules,all of whom are experienced ' parliamentarians, and several of whom Lad a training in the Lower i House, aro unanimous in this opinion. Republican Senators considered in caucus the general course of ac tion to be pursued in regard to President Cleveland’s nominations. Their inclination is to treat the Pres ident generously, but' at the same time they propose to exercise a wise discrimination in reference to con firmations, In some cases better reasons for displacing good officials will be required before confirmation will be granted to their successors. Several Senators questioned in the caucus the President’s good faith in seeking advice from Republican Senators concerning objectionable appointments. A certain Senator related a visit of bis own to the White Rouse for the purpose of pio testing against an appointment Mr. Cleveland was about to make, lie showed that the man who was named for the place had been in dicted and found guilty of violating the revenue laws. lie said In showed the transcripts of the record in both cases, but the man got the appointment all the same. Several hundred of the President’s nominations have been sent to the Senate already. One name among them which promises interesting developments is a prominent Demo crat of Chicago who succeeded as postmaster a life long friend and earnest supporter of Gen Logan. The case presents features over which a lively contest can be made by the Senator from Illinois. Count Zewaski. Count Zewaski, a Polish exile, who when driven from his native land sought refuge and a home be neaih the stars and stripes, for which he fought under Gen. Sh-gol daring the war of the rebellion, in rtt Galena. Count Zewaski is now 04 years of age, and for a number of years has been an inmate of the National .Souliers’ Horne nr Milwaukee. He if. now on his way to Poland, irt which land he wishes to have his bones laid beside those of his fath ers, but before returning to Ins native land to die, he wished to see the old home of General Grant. He is a tine, venerable looking old man, and with Ins bat decorated with feathers ami a revolver in his belt, notwithstanding the weight of long years of exile, tie still carries him seif erect and looks every inch a soldier and a nobleman. —Gazette Gazette. Howto Advertise . When a man sets up a dummy in his store and puts coat, hat and pants on it means it for an adver tisement. When ho arranges a nice display of goods in a window-, he in tends it for an advertisement. When he suspends or sets goods out on the sidewalk, he does it to advertise. All these methods invite the attention of persons already in his store or who are passing by. A newspaper I advertisement dosen’l slay in the 1 store or at its do>r. It goes to see I ihe neighbors arid invites them to ■ the store. h goes into the country i and from house to house calling ion iln- people to go and see the mer chant. It visits more people in a i day than he could v isit in a month, |if he traveled ail the time. They don’t all rush to his store on this in vitation, but the invitation makes them think of him, and when they go to town they are much more likely to call on him than if they did not have it. An advertisemei.l costing 10 is not likely to bring a pioib of $lOO. Men are usually satisfied if the) have 10 lo ‘..f per cent, [irnftr oh an in vestment.
