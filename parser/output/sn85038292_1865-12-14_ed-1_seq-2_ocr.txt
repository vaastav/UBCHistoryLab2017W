ell Oils within a rasohsffik time-' we have amazed the world suppres sion of a civil war whjr^'*^*^ to be beyond the oont-'* government. so we shall show the superiority Of our * i n3 t;*unOns by the prompt and faithful dis '*i charge of our national obligations. The Department of Agriculture under its Present direction, is accomplishing much in developing and utilizing the vast agricultural Capabilities of the country, and for informa tion respecting the details of its management reference is made to the annual report of the Commissioner. I have dwelt thus fully on our domestic affairs because of their transcendent impor tance. Under any circumstances, our great extent of territory and variety of climate, producing almost everything that is neces sary for the wants and even the comforts of man, make us singularly independent of the varying policy of foreign powers, and protect us against every temptation to “entangling alliances,” while at the present moment the re-establishment of harmony will be our best security against “ nations who feel power and forget right. ’ ’ For myself, it has been and it will be my constant aim to pro mote peace and amity with all foreign na tions and powers; and I have every reason to believe that they all, without exception, are animated by the same disposition. Our relations with the Emperor of China, so re cent in their origin, are most friendly. Our commerce with his dominions is receiving new developments; and it is very pleasing to find that the government of that great em pire manifests satisfaction with our policy, and reposes just confidence in the fairnpss Which marks our intercourse. The unbroken harmony between the United States and the Emperor of Russia is receiving a new sup port from an enterprise designed to carry telegraphic lines across the continent of Asia, through his dominions, and 1 so to con nect us with all Europe by a new channel of intercourse. Our commerce with South America is about to receive encouragement by a direct line of mail steamships to the rising Empire of Brazil. The distinguished party of men of science who have recently left our country to make a scientific explora tion of the natural history and rivers and mountain ranges of that region, have re ceived from the Emperor that generous wel come which was to have been expected from his constant friendship for the United States, and his well known zeal iu promoting the advancement of knowledge. A hope is en tertained that our commerce with the rich and populous countries that border the Medi terranean sea may be largely increased. Nothing will be wanting, on the part of this g jvernmeut, to extend the protection of our tlag over the enterprise of our fellow-citizens. We receive from the powers in that region assurances ofgood will; and it is worthy of note, that a special envoy has brought us messages of condolence on the death of our late Chief Magistrate from the Rey of Tunis, whose rule includes the ojd dominions of O irthage on the African coast. Our domestic contest, now happily ended, hai left some traces in our relations with one at least of the great maritime powers. The formal accordance of belligerent rights to the insurgent States was unprecedented, and has not been justified by the issue. But in the systems of neutrality pursued by the powers which made that concession, tbeiy was a marked difference. The materials of! war for the insurgent States were furnished, in a great measure, from the workshops of Great Britain: and British ships, manned by British subjects, and prepared for receiving British armaments, sallied from the ports of Great Britain to make war on American commerce, under the shelter of a commis sion from the insurgent States. These ships, having once escaped from British ports, ever afterwards entered them in every part of the world, to refit, and so to renew their d The consequences of this con duct were most disastrous to* the States then in rebellion, increasing their desolation apd misery by the prolongation of our civil con test. It had, moreover, the effect, to a great extent, to drive the American flag from the sea, and to transfer much of our shipping a id our commerce to the very power whose subjects had created the necessity for such a change, .These events Jonk rilaee before I was called to the administration of the gov ernment. The sincere desire for peace by which I am animated led me to approve the proposal, already made, to submit the ques tions which had thus arisen between the two countries to arbitration. These questions are of such moment that they must have commanded the attention of the great pow ers, and are so interwoven with the peace and interests of every one of them as to have ensured an impartial decision. I regret to inform you that Great Britain declined the arbitrament, but, on the other hand, invited us to the formation of a joint commission to settle mutual claims between the two Coun tries, from which those for the depredations before mentioned should be excluded. The proposition, in that very unsatisfactory form has been declined. The United States did not present the sub ject as an impeachment of the good faith of a power which was professing the most friendly dispositions, but as involving ques tions of pnblic law, of which the settlement is essential to the peace of nations; and. though pecuniary reparation to their injured citizens would have followed incidentally on a decision against Great Britain, such com pensation was not their primary object.— They had a higher motive, and it was in the interests of peace and justice to establish important principles of international law,— The correspondence will he placed before you. The ground on which the British Min ister rests his justification is, substantially, that the municipal law of a nation, and the domestic interpretations of that law, arc the measures of its duty as a neutral, and I feel bound to declare my opinion, before you and before the world, that that justification can • not be sustained before the tribunal of na tions. At the same titne Ido not advise to any present attempt at redress by acts of legislation. For the future, friendship be tween the two countries must rest on the basis of mutual justice. - From the moment of the establishment of our free Constitution, the civilized worldlias been convulsed by revolutions in the inter- ' ests of democracy or of monarchy; but 1 through all those revolutions the linked States have wisely and firmly refused td*be- . come propagandists of republicanism. It is the only government suited to our condition; but we have never sought to impose it on 1 others ; and we have consistently followed ! the advice of Washington to recommend it j only by the careful preservation and prudent , use of the blessing. During all the inter vening period the policy of European Pow ers and of the United States has, on the whole, been harmonious. Twice, indeed, j rumors of the invasion of some parts of j America, in the interest of monarchy, have prevailed ; twice my predecessors have had occasion to announce tho_ views of this na tion in respect to such interference. On * both occasions the remonstrance of the i United States was respected, from a deep \ conviction on the part of European govern- , nients, that the;system of non-interference , and mutual abstinence from propagandises was the true, rule for the two hemispheres. * Since those times we have advanced in wealth t and power; but we retain the same purpose * to leave the nations of Europe to choose 1 their own dynasties and form their own sys- * terns of government. This consistent mod- * cration may justly demand a corresponding ■ moderation. We should regard it as a great ] calamity to ourselves, to the cause of good j government, and 10-thje peace of the world, , should any European power challenge the American people, as it .wera, to the defence 1 of republicanism against foreign interfer- ] ence. We cannot foresee and are unwilling i to consider what opportunities might pre- ( sent themselves, what combinations might j offer to protect ourselves against designs in imical to our form of government The United States desire to act in the future as ’ they have ever acted heretofore; they never t will be driven from that course but by the < aggression of European powers, and we rely j on the wisdom and justice of those powers to respect the system of non-interference which has so long been sanctioned by time, and which, by its good results has ap proved itself to both continents. The correspondence between the United States and France, in reference to questions which have become subjects of discussion between the two govern ments, will, at a proper time, be laid before Congress. Whew, on the organization of our Government, under the Constitution, the President of the United States de livered his inaugural address to the two Houses, of Congress, he said to them, and through them to the country and to mankind, that “the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked on the experiment intrusted to the American people.” And the House of Represen tatives answered Washington by the voice of Madison :—“We adore the in visible hand which has led the Ameri can people through so many difficulties, to cherish a conscious responsibility for the destiny of republican liberty.” More than seventy six years have gli ded away since these words were spo ken: the United States have passed through severer trials than were fore seen ; and now, at this new epoch in our existence as one nation, with our Union purified by sorrows, andstrength ened by conflict, and established by the virtue of the people, the greatness of the occasion invites us once more to re • peat with solemnity, the pledges of our fathers to hold ourselves answerable be fore our fellow-men far the success of the republican form of government. — Experience has proved its sufficiency in peace and in war, it has vindicated its authority through dangers, and afflic tions, and sudden and terrible emergen cies, which would have crushed any system that had been less firmly fixed in the heart of the people. At the in auguration of Washington the foreign relations of the country were few, and its trade was repressed by hostile regu lations ; now all the civilized nations of the globe welcome our commerce, and their governments profess towards us amity. Thou our country felt its way hesitatingly along an untried path, with States so little bound together by rapid means of communication as to be hardly known to one another, and with historic traditions extending over very few years; now intercourse between the States is swift and intimate; the expe rience of centuries has been crowded into a few generations, and has created an intense indestructible nationality.— Then our jurisdiction did not reach be yond the inconvenient boundaries of the territory which had achieved inde pendence; now, through cessions of lands, first colonized by Spain and France, the country has acquired a more complex character, and has for its nat ural limits the chain of lakes, the Gon of Mexico, and on the east and the west the two great oceans. Other nations were wasted by civil war for ages before they could establish for themselves the necessary degree of unity; the latent conviction that our form of government is the best ever known to the world, has enabled us to emerge from civil war within four years, with a complete vin dication of the constitutional authority of the general government, and with our local liberties and State institutions unimpaired. The throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores are witnesses of the confidence of all peoples in our permanence. Here is the great land of free labor, where industry is blessed with unexampled rewards, and the bread of the workingman is sweetened by the consciousness that the cause of the coun try “is his own cause, his own safety, his own dignity.” Here every one en joys the free use of his faculties and the choice of activity as a natural right. Here, under the combined influence of a fruitful soil, genial climes, and hap py institutions,population has increased fifteen-fold within a century. Here, through the easy devclopmcntof bound loss resources, wealth has increased with two-fold greater rapidity than numbers; so that we have become secure against the financial vicissitudes of other coun tries, and alike in business and in opin ion, are self-centred and truly indepen dent. Here more and more care is given to provide education for every one born on our soil. Here religion, released from political connection with the civil government, refuses to subserve the craft of statesmen, and becomes, in its independence, the spiritual life of the people. Here toleration is extended to every opinion, in the quiet certainty that truth needs only a fair field to secure the victory. Here the human mind goes forth unshackled in the pursuit of science, to collect stores of knowledge and acquire an ever increasing mastery over the forces of nature. Here the national domain is offered and held in millions of separate freeholds, so that our fellow-citizens, beyond the occupants of any other part of the earth, consti tute in reality a people. Here exists the democratic form of government; and that form of government, by the confession of European statesmen, “gives a power of which no other form is capa ble, because it incorporates every man with the State, and arouses every thing that belongs to the soul,” Where, in past history, docs a par allel exist to the pnblic happiness which is within the reach of the people of the United States ? Where in any part of the globe, can institutions be found so suited to their habits or so entitled to their love as their own free Constitu tion ? Every one of them, then, in whatever part of the land he has his home, must wish-its perpetuity. Who of them will not now acknowledge, in the words of Washington, that “every step by which the people of tlie United States have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of Providential ageficy ?” Who will not join with me in the prayer that the in-* visible hand which has led us through the clouds that gloomed around our path, will so guide us onward to a per fect restoration of fraternal affection, that we of this day maybe able to trans mit our great inheritance of State gov ernments in all their rights, of the General Government in its whole con stitutional vigor, to our posterity, and they to theirs through countless genera tions. 

ANDREW JOHNSON, Washington, Dec. 4,1865. . '-V THE DEMOCRATIC ADVOCATE. Thursday, December 14, ises. THE MESSAGE. We lay before our readers to-day the whole of the President’s Message to Congress, believing that its importance at this time, when all are in anxious suspense as to the future of our country, will be sufficient excuse for the space it occupies in our columns. It is notable as expressing views directly an tagonistic to the policy laid down by the leaders in Congress as their rule of action regarding the Southern States. The following are some of its important topics : The President says his prede cessor brought the war substantially to a close. He says the harrassing fears which true patriots have had of an ab sorption of State Governments by the General Government should be allayed by the very greatness of our country. That this Government of the United States Is a limited Government, and States with proper power are essential to the existence of the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Johnson op poses the policy of military rule, and says he has always held all acts of Secession to be null and void. He has deemed it necessary to assert one other power of the General Government—the power of pardoning—always claiming a clear recognition of the efficiency of all laws and the fact of the abolition of slavery. Ho says that he has asked all the States to participate in the inesti mable right of amending the Constitu tion, meaning the abolishing of slavery; and says the adoption of that amend ment will reunite us beyond the possi bility of future rupture. The amend ment to the Constitution being adopted, he says, it only remains for the States to take their places in Congress, and thus complete the work of reconstruc tion. He asks Congress to make pro vision for the early resumption of ju dicial functions by the United States Courts in the South, so that those charged with treason may be tried by the highest civil tribunals of the land. He reasserts what he has so often affirmed, that treason is a crime, traitors should be punished, and the offence made odious. In regard to negro "suf frage, he reiterates his former often ex pressed views most emphatically, that the subject must be referred to the several States, denying the competency of the General Government to regulate the franchise ; he says the negroes shall be protected in their freedom and property; that the South will soon be peopled by an enterprising race, whose genius, industry and wealth will vie with any in the Union. The President recommends the re ports of the Secretary of the Interior and Postmaster General, and highly commends the policy of the Secretary of the Treasury in his efforts to diminish the volume of paper money now in cir- { dilation, and says it is our duty to pre pare to meet the great evils which are being wrought by an irredeemable cur rency, recommending all to conform as nearly as possible to the cash system in transacting business. In regard to our relations with foreign Governments, the President claims that the British ministers have failed to justify their course of action toward our Government; he relics upon the wisdom and justice of other powers to respect the doctrine of non-interference, and says: “We should regard it a great “ calamity should any European Power “ challenge the American people to the 1 “ defence of Republicanism against “ foreign interference.” The message closes with a panegyric : upon the greatness of our country, our 1 institutions, the blessings vouchsafed us under the Constitution, and truth- ( fully asks : “\\ here, in past history, “ does a parallel exist to the public “ happiness which is within the reach of “ the people of the United States?” The document, as an entirety, is cer tainly an able one. M hen we take into consideration the state of public feeling at the time President Johnson assumed the duties of the Chief Magistracy, and also the source through which his politi cal fortunes bent their tray in obtaining that position, we have in this message as liberal and conservative . sentiment as we could reasonably expect. It is not as the Andy Johnson of former years would haVfe written it, but it is nevertheless a clear and dignified ex pression of his views after the change that four years of bitter strife have made in them, as it has in the opin ions of all the most prominent men of the day. Some mischievous fanatics in Massachusetts have undertaken to in struct their Maryland brethren in the 1 “Right Way” and have provided a fund for the dissemination of their pe culiar doctrines through the medium of a journal bearing the above taking title. Its; motto is, “Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.” It tells us ' the right way to keep the Southern States and their representatives out of the Union. The Republicans in Mary- j land have practiced the doctrine of loving their neighbors for so long a time that they have become adepts, s and we really think their generous co- i adjutors should sparo themselves this " expense and trouble. t The Thlrty*MloUi Congress. The Thirty-Ninth Congress assem bled on the 4th day of December, and immediately organized, by the election of Mr. Colfax as Speaker and Mr. Mc- Pherson as Clerk of the douse of Representatives. With the large ma jority of its members composed of those whose hearts are filled with that spirit of intolerance which is the fruit of the fanaticism and bigotry which has for its fitting birthplace the New England States, there was a unanimity in their initiatory proceedings which has here tofore never been witnessed in the or ganization of that body. With no con ■ servative element strong enough to make itself heard, the Abolition Press, with a great flourish, proclaim to the country that Congress is a unit! Por tentous words, and fraught with direful significance to every lover of his coun try. It is the unity of despotism—the triumph* of the old doctrine of Feder alism which has been the antagonist of Democracy since the first days of the country’s history. There were those inspired with the hope that the President, by securing from the people of the South an acqui escence in measures of his dictation, and which were but too confidingly granted, might exert an influence upon Congress that would lead to the crea tion of au clement of respectable enough proportions to second the ef forts of the Executive, and pave the way for the admission of the Southern members. But these sanguine ones had not learned correctly the lessons taught by the experience of the last few/"years, nor judged aright the ef fects of the influence of the miserable proscription which is the legitimate off spring of the abuse of that Constitu tion which is 4he bulwark of our politi cal fabric- This violation of the rights of the people, conceived and defended under the plea of “necessity,” spreading its baneful influence through every cor poration and in every community, has sown broadcast the seed which has grown the foul corruption that pervades the arteries of the body politic. Ne cessity has ever been the excuse of all despots for trampling upon the liberties of the masses. Reason would seem to dictate to these legislators that a spirit of conciliation would be best promotive of the welfare of the nation; but all other considera tions are swallowed up in their all absorbing greed for power. THE 

LEGISLATURE. Governor Bradford has issued his proclamation convening the General Assembly of Maryland in extra session at Annapolis, at noon on Wednesday, the 10th day of January, 1866, “to consider such subjects of personal in terest as the Governor may then bring to their attention.” The proclamation states that it is issued at the request of the Governor elect, lion. Thomas Swann, who has advised him of his de sire to convene the Legislature “for the consideration of such subjects as, in his judgment, will render a session necessary,” ani “it is thought that public convenience will be promo ted by calling that body together at an earlier day than could be by him ap pointed after the commencement of his official term.” Extra sessions of the General Assembly are limited to thirty days by a Constitutional provision. The Registry Law, framed under the pro visions of the new Constitution, was designed for the perpetuity of the power of a faction. We trust the first business of the Legislature will be the repeal of this iniquitous enactment, and that all their .future legislation will look to the perpetuation of the power of the people. The President says our National debt is not a National blessing, but a heavy burden upon the industry of the country. The public debt on the 31st of October was $2,740,854,740 —near- ly three billions of money. A large majority of the citizens of Maryland pay their share of this burden, assist in liquidating the indebtedness of the State and other corporations, whilst they for conscience sake are deprived of the right of franchise by State enactment. I®* The zealots who hold supreme sway in Congress, whilst claiming to be the Saviors of the Union, are using' all the machinery of their power to prevent a restoration of harmony in all the States. Brown low says “the Rebels have been whipped, but not whipped enough.”- These Abolition leaders say the Southern people must be taught to have a more loyal heart. Only a differ ent phrase used to express the same meaning. Charles Sumner has introduced a bill in the Senate to allow negroes to sit on Grand and Petit Juries. Also to prescribe an oath “to maintain a republi can form of Government,” in which the party is made to swear that he will al- i ways discountenance and resist any laws making distinction of color or race. IMr. Colfax predicts that the abandoned seats in the House will soon 1 be filled by loyal' and patriotic men. ( The blacker the better suited to his 1 taste, we presume. i 

THIRTY-NIHTH_ CONGRESS. Washington, December 11. On Monday the proceedings of Con gress were interesting. A large num ber of bills and resolutions on\jmpor tant subjects were introduced and* ap propriately referred. The Heuse passed a bill to prohibit the importa tion of cattle from Europe in order - to prevent the spread of the cattle disease. A bill was also passed to provide for filling juries in the District of Colum bia. Resolutions were submitted and referred, earnestly protesting against monarchical designs in Mexico, and instructing the committee on foreign affairs to inquire what measures are ne cessary to restore to the people of Mexico their right of republican gov ernment. The House refused to suspend the rules to vote on the reso lution that pending the discussion of the admission of certain members of the present Congress from States lately in rebellion, they be privileged mean time to the floor of the House. The Speaker announced the standing com mittees. The following named gentle men are chairmen of the most impor tant committees; Foreign Affairs, Nathaniel P. Banks, of Massachusetts; Commerce, E. B. Washburne, of Illi nois; Military, R. C. Schenck, of Ohio; Naval, A. Rice; District of Columbia, E. C. Ingersoll, of Illinois; Judiciary, Mr. Wilson, of Iowa; Ways and Means, J. S. Morrill; Banking and Currency, Pomeroy, of New York; Agriculture, Bidwell, of California; Freedmcn, El liott, of Massachusetts; Appropriations, Thaddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania; Pacific Railroad, Price, of Iowa; Claims. Delano, of Ohio; Public Lands, Julian, of Indiana; Postoffices, Alley, of Mas sachusetts; Revolutionary Claims, Whaley, of West Virginia; Manufac tures, Moorehead, of Pennsylvania; Militia, Smith, of Kentucky; Territo ries, Ashley, of Ohio; Public Build ings, Rice, of Maine; Public Expendi tures, Hurlburd, of New York; Private Land Claims, Thayer, of Pennsylvania: Invalid Pensions, Perham, of Maine; Patents, Jenckes, of Rhode Island, who is also chairman of the Committee on the Bankrupt Law. The Senate appointed a committee to act with the House committee on the subject of Mr. Ljpcoln’s death. A resolution was offered by a Mis souri member to the effect that in con sidering the question of admission oi Southern Representatives, the fact that negroes were not allowed to vote should have no effect in determining the ques tion, bnt was not acted on. Southern Congressmen. Senator Hahn admits the improba bility of any Southern members getting into Congress. Tennessee seems tt form an exception, however, and her delegation, it is believed, will be admit ted by common consent.—mV. Y. Trib. The point of this paragraph is quite apparent. According to the Constitu tion, the President must virtually ol an inhabitant of one of the States the Union—and Mr. Johnson woul(|oc upy a very awkward position as Presi dent from a State not in the Union. — Therefore, “Tennessee is to form an ex ception,” and her “delegation is to be admitted by common consent”—to avoid the troublesome question relative tc the feasibility of permitting a for eigner to hold the position of President. —Newark Journal. SQf“The Dorchester News having charged the late postmaster of the town of Cambridge with having, during the war, retained posession of letters which reached his office, the latter has sent to the News a copy of the order under which he acted. It will be . seen that he received from the Post Office De partment instructions to hand over all suspicious letters to the nearest milita ry commander. The postmasters of country towns and villages have been clothed with absolute authority to de tain, at their discretion, any letter which might find its way into their re spective offices. The following is the order to the postmaster of Cambridge : “Post Office Department, ) “[Confidents!.]” Appointment Office, I Washington, Jan. 81, 1863. j 11 Sir —Frequent inquiries are made by postmasters as to the disporition they shall make of letters deposited in their offices to be sent through the mails which they have reason to suspect contain treasonable matter, or other information intended to overthrow the Government. - “In order to prevent unnecessary delay, the Postmaster General directs that in all cases where a postmaster has good cause to suspect, and does suspect any letter deposi ted in his office contains matter of informa tion of the character above specified, be im mediately inform i|he ntaraet Military Com -"■Jw of feet, With the reasons and grounds ofbis suspicions ; and that he deliv er such‘letters to such Military Commander upon his request, taking his receipt for the same, and forwarding H, together with any correspondence he may have had upon the subject, to the Department.

It has assert ed and exhibited the power and unan imity of the Republican party. This to content the Senators for some time. After having indicated’ their own policy in regard to restoration, they have nothing more to do than to let the President’s plan Work its way in the South, against the obstacles which .they have opposed to it. They say jocosely at the Capi tol that McPherson, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, will have a large placard posted over the door of the House of Representatives, bearing the inscription, “No foreigners ad mitted.” 

FROM WASHINGTON. ' Washington, December 11. The long agony of the Senatorial cau cus upon the ThacL stcrens resolution is at an end. Rightly apprehending an executive veto if they panned it they put the thing in the shape of a “Call for a Joint Committee!’ of nine from the House and six from the Senate. This is to inquire into the condition of the South and report as to the right of re presentation of the late Confederate States. Under this arrangement Ten ■ nessee will be likely to come in soon, for the reason that the President is the dispensor of patronage and from that • -State.

Scott Norris, assisted during the first week of the meetings by ■ Rev. j. J. Murray, President of Conference, aud Rev. P. Light Wilson, the former pastor. The services have been largely attended, and bid fair to be instrumental in at taching many new members to the church. In this connection we would state that the efforts to raise funds for the purpose of erecting a new church edi- Jipe by this denomination, which did not meet with so prompt a response a year or two ago, are now more success ful. The congregation are confident of being able to commence the new struc ture next season.

He has delivered two 'lectures before good audiences, and most elo quently portrayed the sufferings and deprivations to which the Southern people are now, subjected. In his own 1 language/thc stories would bring tears to the eyes of all those whose hearts are hot of adamant. We trust his efforts were rewarded with success.
