The Charleston News publishes a list of the Legislature, frotq which it appears that the composition of that body is as follows: In tha Senate there are six Democrats and twenty-five Radicals, eighteen white and seven colored. In the House of Representatives there are fifteen Democrats aud one hundred and eight Radicals, thirty-six of whom are white and seventy two colored. ? There are only two fat offices to be filled during the present session, and as there is a number of hungry candidates, the contest promises to be exciting, to them at least The people do not feel much interest in the matter, as none of the candidates can fairly lay claim to any great popularity or respect. Mackey, Neagle, Cardoza, Moses, Willard, Hoge and Boozer, all aspire to be United States Senator. For the office of Associate Judge of the Supreme Court, the cards have not yet appeared, though candidates are feeling around. Whipper is repbrted to be in the lead, as he is the candidate of the Radical "white ring" in the House. ?The correspondent of the Charleston News says there are between fifty and sixty railroad lobbyists in Columbia, with, an immense sum of money.

Several memorials have been presented in the Legislature for the repeal or suspension of the township law, and a Bill has been introduced by DeLarge (colored)} to consummate this purpose.. The following extract, from the Columbia correspondence of the Charleston Neios furnishes some interesting information on the subject:, . If the assertions of the members may.be relied upon, the bill offered by DeLargej colored, to repeal the "Act to organise townships and to define their powers and privileges', will be passed. The eighteen or twenty conntv commissioners who held a conference here last July, being of the opinion I that the impoverished oondition of the State, at the present time, renders it impossible for the peoi nip to nav the additional taxes which the require ments under this act proyide for, have memorialized the Legislature to suspend the act for ten years, and ask that the county commissioners be directed to appoint for each townshrp one special commissioner, who stall be under their snperrisionj and whose remuneration shall not exoeea two dollars per day when actually employed; and the duties of whom shall be to inspect and report to the commissioners the condition of highways ana bridges, and supervise and report to the same the condition of the poor; to prepare and return annually to the county commissioners a complete list of the qualified voters within his township, from which list they shall select not exceeding one,for eveiy ten, nor less than ope for every twenty of said voters iB the township, respectively, ,who shall, in their opinion, be qualified legally To serve as jurors, in accordance with the act passed the 2oth day of September, 1868, entitled 41 An Act to regulate the maimer of drawing jurors,the first1 registration after the proposed act to be the basis of computation, and a new;computation to be made after,eac^ new registration ;,.$hat be be required to summon all persons between the ages of eighteen and fifty, to work the ptiblic roads within tneir, respective townships,, for not less than six days each year, if so muoh be deemed necessary, and all defaulters, after being duly summoned, shall be subieat to a penalty of double the number of days. The memorial, further, represents that the several county commissioners should ha obligated in and for the penal sum of three thousand dollars, conditioned upon the lawful perfbrmarice of his duties; the Charleston County Commissioners to be, with like condition, obligated in and for the penal Bum of ten thousand dollars; that all'work ordered by the county commissioners be given dot by contract to the lowest bidder, .in their Respective counties, with real estate security, for the faithful performance of the contract, when the amount ofit exceeds one hundred dollars. The conference, in their report, argue that if the State (containing 37,000 square^ miles) be divided as the law directs, it will oontain seven hundred and forty townships, each of which will , require seven officers. The law allows one dollar and fifty ronta n?r diem far each officer when-mi dutv. Kacll officer, perhaps, will be on duty one hundred and fifty days in a year, making the pay of the officers for one township, ror one year, fifteen hundred and seventy-five ($1575) dollars, and the pay of all the officers for all the townships, for one year; one million one hundred and sixty-five thousand and five hundred ($1,1G5,500) dollars. This enormous expense shocks, as it should, the county commissioners, and they'suggest plans to reduce the expense by recommending the suspension of the act for ten yearp, but at the same time they cling somewhat to the features of the act. They first request that the time for holding an election for county commissioners be extended so as to correspond with the State election, .claiming that thereby a Baving of at least twenty thousand dollars per annum to the State will be effected; then they recommend a special commissioner for each township, making seven hundred and forty of these officers for the State. It is estimated that eadh officer will be on duty about forty days in the year ?making each officer's pay eighty dollars ($80) per annum, and for all the officers, for all the townships, for the year, fifty-nine thousand two hundred ($59,200) dollars. It is true that this is a considerable reduction, but why should they have any special commissioners? What is wdnted of them is, it seems to me, exactly what the oounty commissioners are paid to do. Besides, how much labor is to be expected of a man who gets only eighty dollars a year? This is a small sum, and one "for which," to use the argument of the report, in regard to the one dollar and a half pdr day paid for services of officers nhder the act, "no competent man, if he honestly discharge his duty, would be willing to give his services. It is to be hoped that the bill to abolish the "Township act" will pass, and thus rid the State of what is not only an intolerable nuisance, but to support which also remiirPQ nn onnrmmis einfinHitiire of monev. . + ?

The further consideration was postponed,- and it was made the special onler for Wednesday, December 8, at 1 pi m. 'j ; rr? T"1 ",'f r v * C Robinson's Show. The 'Chester Rtowtcr, of last, week, gives 1 Robinson's Circns and Menagerie thoifollowiig ( first-rate notice. . The Ciroas was here on Monday. Chester sustained her well-earned reputation as a liberal pat- ' ronizer of this branch of the fine arta The orowd ' was immense, and was on hand early so as to lose nothing of the sights or smells. Bv far the greater portion of the crowd consisted of those who are , proud to call themselves 'the laboring population.' y With what propriety they arrogate this title to themselves we are at a loss to undoratand, unless 1 it is on the liwua djum htcerulo principle. The performance was identity the same as when they c exhibited here twplvc months ago?the same iokes ] were rehearsed by the clown?the same old'bat- j tercel masks were paraded by the K. K.?the i comic mule, so-calleu, pitched the nigger over his . head in the same approved style?the same trained ' horse agonized round the ring in what was called * a waltz?the short-skirted and calf-padded beauties i disported themselves as gracefully as before on the t rope?the animals raised as big a stink as usual? . and all in all it was the same old show over again. The most noticeable feature of the whole exnibi- 1 tion was the daring bare back riding of Miss I Cordelin. Her bold feats were performed with wonderful agility and gracefulness. Though ahe has grown some?at least 'the altitude of a chopin'?siuce her former performance at this place, c ner improvement in riding has not kept pace with j the development of her stature. Her riding was j not so good as when here in 1808. She lost her balance several times in jumping backwards aorosa 1 the banners, and found herself suddenly on the c ground. It may be that! she was unwell and not [ in good oondition ibr riding. Soon after the close of the show they 'folded t their tents like an Arab, and as quietly stole away' ( towards Youngesville where they were due on Tuesday. We devoutly trust it may be many a day before we see their faces among us again. : 0 BQrThe Radicals have carried the elections for t Governor, &o., in Mississippi and Texas. j j , a ? , i i .
