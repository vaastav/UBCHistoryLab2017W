Swineford, governor of Alaska, in a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, represents that through what he believes to have been an ab ?urd if not corrupt decision of the late judge of the United States court, private parties secured possession and control of the government wharf at Sitka and now monopolize the coal trade He says that the vessels of the Pacific Coast steamship company refuse to land coal for any body but the parties who are in possession of the wharf, and they, in consequence, are able to ex tort exorbitant prices. The governor asks that the senior naval officer stationed there be authorised to supply the eiril authorities with coal at cost price. The matter has been referred to the Nay department.

A statement from the director of the mint, in response to Senator Stewart's resolution of last session as to the amount of silver bullion offered monthly to the government since 1878, was presented and ordered printed. CERTIFICATES OF ELECTION OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECl'O&S. A communication from the Secretary of State, with a certified copy of the final ascer tainment of presidential electors in Kansas, was presented. The presiding officer asked the opinion of the SeHute (this being an entirely new proceed ing) as to the disposition to be maae of the papers?whether they should be entered on the journal or placed in the archives of the Senate. He adued that similar certificates from the states of Maryland, North Carolina and Georgia had been also transmitted by the Secretary of State. After some suggestions, the provision of the law of February. 1887, was rend, and was found to require the Secretary of State to transmit copies of such certificates to the two houses of Congress. Mr. Sherman moved to refer the papers to the committee on privileges and elections, and called attention to the novelty of the proceed ing. He expressed the opinion that the pro ceeding (if not an infringement of the consti tution ) was extra-constitutional. The constitu tion plainly required each state to provide, under its own laws, for the election of presi dential electors, and that their action should be certified to the president of tho Senate. He doubted whether Congress had any authority to require states to send certificates to the Sec retary of State, but that was a question for consideration. Mr. Edmunds said that it was a very simple matter, and that Congress had in the law of 1887 simply enlarged the degree of security and certainty in regard to the transmittal of these certificates. It was a precaution against the loss of papers or other contingencies. Mr. Hoar suggested that it was also intended to have the matter put on record promptly, so that there should bo no tampering with it under the stress of political temptation. After further discussion the papers were re ferred to the committee on privileges and elections. 

COMMITTEES CONTINUED. The resolution for continuing the select com mittees on the meat products and on the rela tions with Canada were reported back from the committee on contingent expenses and adopted with amendments. BILLS INTRODUCED. Numerous bills were introduced and re ferred. including the following: By Mr. Stewart?To open to actual settlers the abandoned military reservations in Nevada. By Mr. Manderson?For the establishment of a national biological laboratory. By Mr. Blair?To organize government bu reaus of information relating to employments, occupations, wants, mean* of livelihood and homes. THE TARIFF BILL. The Senate at 1:05 resumed the consideration of the tariff bill, beginning with schedule B, which covers earthenware and glassware. Mr. Mcpherson called attention to schedule B. and said, to his mind, the rates of duties provided in the Senate bill were an increase on the existing rates. He believed that the pro visions (in both bills) to prevent undervalua tion would result in increasing the protection on glass and pottery ware more than 10 per cent. His own state was largely interested in these industries, but he did not believe that they needed the amount of protection pro posed. The Mills bill, he thought, accorded to them all the protection they needed to compete with foreign countries, although he nught desire some changes of classification. He re sumed the right to offer some amendments hereafter to the glass and pottery items. Mr. Hoar also reserved the right to offer some amendments to the glass paragraphs. No amendment, except as to two formal changes of phraseology, was made to schedule B. and the Senate proceeded to the considera tion of schedule C, relating to metals. House of Representatives. perry belmont's resignation. The Speaker stated that be had received a communication from Hon. Perry Belmont in forming him that he had sent to the governor of New York his resignation as a member of Congress from the first congressional district of New York. The clerk was directed to drop Mr. Belmont's name from the roll of the House. REFERRING THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.

DIRECT TAX BILL. The order relative to the consideration of this direct tax bill was so modified as to make the measure a special order for to-day, Tuesday and Wednesday, it being the desire of many members that an adjournment be taken over Saturday. An effort was made to reach some agree ment touching the offering and pendancy of amendments, but it proved futile; and without any understanding on this point the House, on motion of Mr. Caswell (Wis.), went into com mittee of the whole (Mr. Springer, of Illinois in the chair) on the direct tax bill. OVEB FIFTEEN MILLION. Mr. Cassell explained that the simple purpose of the bill waPto refund to the states and indi viduals who paid the tax that portion of the direct tax which was collected. After a careful computation he was able to state that the bill carried $15,227,032. This did not include the 15 per cent commission allowed the states or parties who paid the tax. The amount to be canceled, now uncollected, was $2,562,401. MR. OATE8 SATS IT IB UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Mr. Oates (Ala.) said that the first ground of his opposition to the measure was that there was no authority conferred upon 'Congress by the constitntion to pass the bill or to moke the Appropriation provided for. He contended, not for a strict construction of the constitu tion, but for an observance of ill His second objection was that it was just in ito pro visions. He sent to the clerk's desk and had read for information a series of amend ments which he proposed to offer at the proper time. The first refunds tne cotton tax; the second permits persons who paid that tax to bring suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount paid; the third revives the right of action in the Court of Claims under the pro visions of the captured and abandoned prop erty act, and the fourth directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in making payment and set tlement of the direct tax, to wee into account and set off any amount due by any state to the Unitad States under the act of June 28,1836, "Tr regulate the deposits of publio money." Mr. Barnes (Ga.) said that the purpose of the bill was to execute a release as to the tax un collected and to refund the tax collected to those who had paid it. Considered in this mere statement of the question, without re gard to the constitutional principles, there was an appearance of equity in the scheme.

The wind had blown through hi* whiskers until they lay every which way. The birds had been plenty, he said, but the wind was too strong for first class shooting. Bates' folks were ready fur Harrison. Two young ladies who are staying there?Miss Etta Hasskell. of Plainfield.'auo Delia Haren?had flags and csmpaign banners stuck in the parlow windows, and each girl stood at the door with a tin horn to blow Har rison to supper. The voung men of the party l*d turned around in the middle of the after noon and hunted back to town, but the Presi dent-elect was ready to rest. For an hour he sat at Bates' well-laden table, and then smoked aud told stories. "How did this town of Dana-get its name?" he asked, as be sat before the fire.

"Oh," was the general's laughing remark, "be needn't let that worrv him. Dana did us as much good as any of them. It was amusing to read the <Sun during the campaign. Yon could see in every issue of it that it was knifing Cleveland under the fifth rib. I kuow per sonally that Dana wanted to beat Cleveland." Then the President-elect began to expatiato on the habits of quail. "I have noticed," he ?aid. "that they always rise with their heads pointed in different directions, like the radii of a circle, the huntsman is a center, so tha flight of every bird is straight from him. tt is just so with carp in the water."
