His lettor is 'interesting and will repay perusal. Tbe Nnprrmr Court. G it AST and Congress will probably differ somewhat with regard to the Snpreme Coorr. Grant wants the salaries of tbe Judges increased. Con I gress indicates a disposition to abolish the whole tribunal. Grant tells the : law-givera they ought to raise the wages of tbe Conrt once, when they raise their own twice. The law givers respoBd with the Drake bill. Here is a "bloody ruction." Who shall speak the "peace-be-still T" The piesent Admiuistration-is exceed ing modest. It claims eredit for a geod part of the financial success which at tended the last year of Johnson's Ad ministration. The report of the Secre tary of the Treasury shows a surplus of receipts over expenditures for the year ending June 30tb, 1869, of abont $50, 000,000. Eight months of that year were covered by the Johnson Adminis tration; four months by Grant and Boutwkll. And yet BofTWELL would assume the glory of eatning and saving what was earned and saved before he came into power. Indeed, the Grant Administration did not get fairly to wo: It before the close of the last fiscal year. The assessments, collections and disbursements of that year, its whole | financial management, was controlled almost entirely by Johnson officials. The impndenco of the Massachusetts financier is apparent. Krtrrurhuiral. V.'irb all the fuss made about tbe ro i! action of the debt wilder Grant's Ad ministration, there is little prospect of a induction in taxation, The estimates of expenditures for tbe coming year, made by the beads of Departments, are footed tip by tbe Washington corres poudent ot the Pittsburgh Commercial to a totnl of $21 0,1*70, 653. To these must be added aboat $13 600,000 for de ficiencies from last year.making a grand aggregate of not far from $225,000,000, exclusive of intorest on the public debt. ! For thin latter item a fair estimate would be $150,000,000, currency valua tion. So it will be seen that tbe public expenses for next year will be $375,000, 00i?, and by rt-asou of extravagance may reach $1 '0,000,000. Last year the sum tot n.1 of experse was $321,000,000; just ! win ro the retrei.e ment comes in we fail i to perceive, nor does it clearly appear bow taxation is to be lightened, if the expouses of the Government are to be placed upon the basis assigned them by Giunt'8 officials. The Drake Rill. U:> Monday morning Senator Drake, of Missouri, introduced into th# Senate a bill depriving the Supreme Court of the lluited States of jurisdiction over all case* involving the constitutionality of j nets of Congress. That is to say, if ' Congress chooses to subvert the Consti tution in its most important and vital provisions there is to bo no remedy agaiokt the usurpation. The Le;;isla-| tive will thus be made, in effect, the only Department of the Government, because it will have jower to abolish both the others at its pleasure. Radicalism seems indisposed to cease its attacks upon our system of Govern ment. During the war tbe violent usurpations thai were carried into effect were dt feuded under the plea that the safety of the nation demanded them. Now, without even the poor pretext of military necessity, a more dangerous, j malicious and revolutionary proposition , than any made duiing tho lieated term of the rebellion, is proposed iL tbn Sec ale cf the United States. Of course, we cannot tell what suppeit thu Diiakk bill may receive. We only know that j it proposes to completely change oar system of Government, aud change it for the worse. To plaoe any Depart ment above tbe Constitution is simply to establish a despotism. Hht Nhnll b? Jnd|f t A Virginia delegation interviewed Gkakt yesterday. The Virginians thanked him for recommending the admission of their State. Ihey hoped they might continne to have his good will. Ulyssea hoped they might con tiua.< to deserve. The Virginians re quested the President to appoint Alex Rives United States Judge for the Fourth Distriei. The President replied that Ai.xx. was "too old." Thu delega tion explained that Rives was only sixty-three, bnt in vain. This is comforting to the West Vir ginia candidates. Rives is too old at sixty-three. That lays Maxwell out. What a pity ! And a bachelor at that. Eft win, Edwin ! IIow your castle crum bles when the President announces that he don't respect gray hairs! Judge Tom Harrison is another '"exempt." If the liuiit could be raised "a leetle,'' he might make it. Nat Har rison may be within range. If not, let Graxt hold on until after the Leg- 1 islatnre meets. Nathaniel will ba "set , back" enough thon for all practical purposes. Any how he would be a younger man at sixty five than almost anybody else at forty.

The New York Herald has been calling upon President Grant to bnild a ship canal across the Iethmns of Darien, promising him in the event of his sac cess snch an immortality of fame as could not fail to be gratifying to the de parted spirit of Grant several thousand years hence. "Before oar late civil war," says the Herald, "one hundred millions of money as an investment in anything, was an amount too enormous and foo awful to Ui thought of. Bati^tha war, in developing oitT financial capUbilitiea has reduced the matter of a hundred or five hundred million* to n mfeie baga telle." The President's message shows hiir nibbling at the Herald 't bait. I5ur we venture the opinion that both Grant aud his tyigh flying adviser will find tbat the people are uot disposed to run wild after f. -b risky enterprises as that suggested. The present financial burthen, wo opine, is about as heavy as they care to carry. Such undertakings as building caDals across isthmuses are expensive on?a, and entail a vast expenditure of meaus. It is doubUd if the one across Darien could be constructed (or less than two hundred miilious, and that amount, just now, our Treasury cannot spar* very conveniently, from the very essential fact t'aat it hasn't got the money. At a time when the Govern ment itself is uucoilain where to raise the meaus to meet the liabilities now piessing against it, to enter upen auch schemes as this Darien canal, and thus almost dwuble the burthen of taxation ?inder which the country already groans and bends, would be worse than folly ? j it would be criminal. We do not underestimate the import ance of the work to the needs of the commercial world. We fully realize all the advantages to be derived lrom such a canal. But we submittbat now is not the proper time to undertake it. The country is iu no condition to stand the expeoso. Oar immeusa dsbt is as much as can be haudled at present, and is more than the Administration gives token of ability to handle. After we have ex tinguished the warjd' bt w;ll bo time enough to t-lk about adventuring iu schemes, involving the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars. The Tenure ot Oilier Act. The old controversy between the President and the Senate about the Tenure of Office Act nee rns likely to be revived Grant in his message de mands the repeal of that Act, and his demand is couched in terms that will teud rather to revive the aucient wrath j of the friends of the measure in the, Senate thnu to seonre compliancc with the President's wishes. As a matter of abstract right this Tenure of Office Act ought never to have been enacted. Its enactment was a violent encroachment npon the right ful powers of the Executive. But as it has bten passed, passed for an avowed partisan object, and as it subsequently received the approval of Grant himself, it is not remarkably unfair that ho thould enjoy its beDetits. This thiDg of special legislation for special cases, this policy of enlarging or limiting tho Ex ecutive power according to tho political j views of the Executive, is too abomina ble for patient consideration. Let Pres I ident Grant groau awhile under John son's shackles. There is poetic justice in the idea. The Senate, however wrong in originating the Tenure #t Office principle, will give geueral satis faction by continuing its application.

Kd.lvrt of tlto lU^istei : As you solicit oar reap on deuce from various parts of the conntry, I will, in compliance, drop you a line from this point. One of the ilia of life is travel ing. and my recent experince has not changed the opinion I long since formed regarding it. I arrived here wearied and disgusted with railroad ho tela. Oue of them 1 wish my friends to avoid ? I mean that at Paris, Tiun. Let not the savory smell of beefsteak and coffee lure them within the walls o I that pine board edifice. Au ? xorbit.mt charge aoU a feeling of mortification at not possessing sufficient "muscle" to ltreak the biscuit is the only return for the effort. Memphis is doing a large business in cotton, and her Cotton Brokers are now leaping a rich harvest. Almost every boat arriving at thisport brings mor^or less of the staple of the Sonth, especial ly the Arkansas and White river boats. It is not an unfreijuent sight to seq wag ons laden with it froui the country sur rounding the city, bringing to market the prooeedeof the pant Summer's labor, reminding one of the Northern farmers "taking their wool to town." And the irrepressible "Caff* with h amall wagon and one malo hauls to the oity his crop, and in return takes to the plantation a supply of bacon, tobacco and clothiug. Cotton i9 now soiling for twenty-three cents per pound. At this rate the pro ducer realizes largely from his capital and labor, and soon the Sonth will be richer than bofoie the war. If the expectations of the Sfemphians are bntbalf realised, theirs will be a great oity. A number of railroads are pro jected; among others I may mention a Southern Pacific, extending from this place thrsugh Arkansas, Northern Tex as to ?1 Paso, Mexico, and thence to the Pacific coast. Already they claim cap ital enough has been secured in Europe, through the influence of John C. Fre mont, to complete the road. It will extend to the Atlantic coast by way of Knoxville and the Virginia Central railroad. At present the project looks as though it would succeed. At this time there is war bet ween the Fremont partf and Governor Clayton's rin^over the Memphis A Littlo Rock railroad. Clayton having the power, i? evidently the winning man. As I have business in that country, I am compelled to uu dergo the miseries of steamboating np the Arkansas, the railroad not being yet completed. No doubt this place "ill increase rapidly is population and business, as she possesses great natural advantages : a surrounding conntry rich and varied in its products; a great river, affording communication with the North and extreme South; numerous railroad* completed and projected, and a climate ansurpaased. The weather U clear aH bright, and reminds me of a pleaaa?t day in April at home. The magnolia and other trees in the Park and ptivflk yards am green and beautiful. The United Statea Circuit Court if now in session, Judge J. S. Trigg pre' siding. He is a fair lawyer and a tber oagh gentleman. Most of the cause* ou the docket relate to cotton tr?ns?* tions during the war. To-day the trial was closed in the ease of Martin rfc Bridges & Co. It was for a large qoan tity of cotton burned in Arkansas dncv ing the war. Quite an array of legal talent is employed in the cause. A large amount of business in all tbe Courts accumulated daring tbe war and ih yet undisposed of. To give you an idea of its extent I may say that then* arp inltflb Law Court of "the connty of Shelby "bp wards of three thousand cases on that ('.?cket. Among the names on the register of tliis hotel (tbe Peabody) I notice those of Jefferson Davis, ex-Oevernor Harris, General Ewell and some others, who took a prominent part in the late rebel lion. Davis is here looking after tbe interests of some insurance company of which ho is now President. He is very unassuming in his manner, and yon might pass him a dozan times a day and never once think he occupies such a prominent position in the history of | the couutry. I tind a few Wheeling men engaged in business here ? among others, our genial yonng friend Charlie Brues, who is in the house of Jas. Cole, 267 Main street. He appears to be very popular. I have made very nany pleasant ac quaintances bore, yet there ieoae pecu liarity belonging to the citi zens? I mean that of bestow ing gratuitous military titles. For instance, they persist in intro ducing me to their friends as Col. . Fighting is not in my line, and I never was even corporal in tbe militia. Be fore closing I may eay that a duel is on hands, growing ont of an article in this morning's Aralanche. Mutual friends are making an effort to reconcile tbe parlies. In politics Tennessee is experiencing a great change. The present Legisla ture is repealing most of the laws so ob noxious to the people. Many offices created for the purpose of supportivg mere adventurers are being abolished, many of tbe officers are resigning, and t be people are being governed by officers ac ceptable to them and who are acquaint ed with their wants and necessities. Under this changed state of things, I find the people satisfied with the Fed eral Government and having no desire for the independsuce of the South. With a wise and moderate policy toward them, I believe that in a short time the t?eople will be more attached to the Union than ever before. A Constitu tional Convention soon meets to amend the organic laws of the State. I will, perhaps, describe more fully the pro posed changes in a future letter. B. TltEASUBY 

KEPOHT. I Krport of Hrcrelary lUuKrtll. Trkasoby Department, ) December 0, 160U- } I have the honor to sabmit herewith the annual report of the doings and conditions of the Treasury Department. In this report I naturally treat, first, I the matters of adminibtration and their i measures of public policy. The officers | in charge of the varions bureaus aud divisions of the Treasury Department havH faithfully performed their duties, aud I commend their several icports to the consideration of Cougress. The Treasurer of the United States has prepared an elaborute report sotting forth tb?> present condition of the Treas ury and furnishing a resume of the business of the Treasury office from lb(il to the present time. Long and faithful servic?s of the present Treasurer enti tles him tp the gratitude of the country. The report of the Commissi?ner of Internal Revenue is respectfully com mended to the attention of Congress. Since the appointment of the present Commissioner the administration of the offic-e has been constantly improving. The increase of receipts tor the lirst live uiouihs of the present fiscal year m the sum of $14,431,333 66 over the amount collected in the first five months of the last fiscal year is satisfactory testimony to the ability and integrity of the per sons employed in that branch of the public service. The amount paid by warrants for col lecting the revenue lrom customs dnr iug the fiscal year endlfig June 30, 18SA, was $(i,378,385 -13. and for the year end ing June 30, 1868. $3 376,738 13, showing a decrease of Sl,U01,('<47 30. The de crejiJ?o iu the cost of collecting revenue has not been attended by any lost* of efficiency in the service. On th? other hand it is believed that the means for the deteotiou of smuggling are better than ever before and that the custom house service is also constantly improv ing. It ought to be understood that the chief means of collecting revenue and enforcing the reveuut> laws must be found in tht administration of the Ap praiser'* department. The frauds and losses arising from actual smugglingare unimportant when compared with the losses sustained through the incompetent or dishonest examiners and appraisers. Assuming that honest men may be obtained for these important positions at the present salaries it is yet true that incompetent appraisers or examiners may daily sub ject the Government to lswes far ex ceeding the amount of their salary. Dnder existing laws certain Revenue officers and other persons appearing as informers are entitled to shares in tinea, penalties and forfeitures. During the fiscal years of 1^66 and 1S69 the Treas ury Department distributed the sua of t2t?,6?7,36l to such officers or to inform ers in various cases arising under the customs and revenue laws. A large ad ditional sum was also paid through the Internal Revenne office. The reason on which the laws grant ing such allowances is based is, that officers of the Government are stimu lated to greater activity in the discov ery of frauds and in btinging offenders i to pnnisbment. Therp can be no doubt1 that such is the etiect of this policy, but the experience I have had in the Treas ury Department lias convinced me that | the evils attending the system are greater than the beuetits derived from it. It often occurs that revenue officers ?re l.d to a>*ert claims in behalf of the Government which 'Lave no jost four datioa in law or iu the fact* of respect ive cases, and where real claims exist it is often the ot^eet of the informsr and officers who share iu the penalties to misrepresent the case to the Govern ment so as to secure the greater advant- ! age to themselves. Cuba's more sen- 1 ions evil is fonndin the practice quite] general of allowing persons a fraudu lent course aatil a result is reached which will insnre to the beac-Bt of the : officers and informers, instead of check ing criminal practices at the outset. It ? is impossible to s?t forth in exact lan guage the character of the evils that grow out of the prtssnt system. I am, i however, clearly of the opinion that the Government ought to rely on public ; officers for the proper performances of ( tbeir duties without sLimalating tbem , by any contingent advantages. 1 have I recommended an increase of salaries of eostom officers, and the abolition of the ' system of g?v ing^t? them a share of fines, penalties and forfeitures will be i an additional reason for an inorease of J salaries. In this department of the public service it has become a practice for clerks and other persons who have held office in the Treasury Department to accept employment as agents or at torneys for parties having claims against the Department, ana there is reason to believe that in some instances the information obtained wbile in pub lic service has been nsed in aid of claimants. Withont detailing all of the objections to this practice, I re spectfully suggest a law debarring per- j sons from practicing before the Treas- 1 ury Department as agents or attorneys 1 in behalf of claims thet were pending' when such persons were officers of the Department. In March last there were employed in the Treasury Department, at Washing toil, 8848 cie/ks, messengers -and labor ers at a monthly cost of $*??,921.61. At present ibe whole number ?f such employes is 2441, and their monthly pay amounts to $238,280.00, showing a de crease of eiptnsos ar. the rate of $57, 168.64 per annum. It was found neces sary, however, daring the periods men tioned, to increase the force in the Iutemal Revenue Ofliie and in tbeoffice of the First Comptroller. This increase in the aggregate in at the rate of $804.40 per annum. This statement does not relate to the force in employment in the bureau of eograving and printing. In March last there were sixty-two special agents in the service of the Department, receiving in the aggregate for their ser vices the sum of $371.10 per day. Each of these agents made his report to the Department and acted under its direct orders. The number at present employ ed is fifty-four and their daily pay amounts to $369.95. The pay of the agents has been increased generally in Ibe hope that more efficient service might be obtained. The sea coast and frontiers of the country have been divided into sixteen special agency districts, and a superin tendent appoiuted for each. Assistants have aUo been appointed and detailed to act under the several district agents. The orders of the Department are in all oases sent to the agent in charge of the district, and reports of his assistants are made to him. The agent is required to make a monthly report of his doings and of the doings of his subordinates. The results thus far obtained appear to justify the organization. Arrangements have been made for the manufacture of paper for the currency, and other obligations of the United States, and for the printing of the same, with increased security of the Govern ment against the unlawful issue from the genuine plats. Under the 11th sec- 1 tion of an Act approved June 30th, lb*>4, entitled "An Act to provide way and means for the support of the .Govern merit, and for other purposes," a pecu liar paper has been designated as the Government paper, and by that Aot it is made felony for asy person to have or retain in bis possession any similar pa per adapted to the making of any obli gations or securities of the United States, except under authority of the Secretary of the Treasury or somc'other proper officer of the United States. Ar rangements had beoti made for the raati 1 factors of this paper by Messrs. Wil >x & Co., near Philadelphia, and the mills owned by them, which are exclu sively devoted to this purpose, have been placed ouder the supervision of of ficers of the Government, and such pre cautions have been taken for the cus tody of the portions of the machinery as to reuder it impossible for the paper manufacturers to obtain it by dishon esty; it is received by agents of the Government stationed at the mills, and upon the requisition of the department it is shipped to the National Bank Note Company, tho American Batik Note Company and the Punting Bureau of the Treasury Department, as tho c.ise may require. Arrangements have also been made with each of the two companies mentioned, for the propoBiug of the plates 'for every issue of currency or other obligations the Engraving and Priuting Bureau at Washington pre pares a third set and each office places an imprint upon every obligation of the Government. Notice of the trans mission of paper from the agent at the mills, and its receipt by each ot the several offices of tho deliveries there from and the Sealing Bureau in the Treasury Department and also of de li vcries to the Treasurer of the United, States is given each day by telegram or by letter and on the following day ac countauts in the Treasury Department prepare a statement showing the disposition of ever v sheet of pa-! per manufactured. In the month of November the paper at the null and in each of thesever.il printing es- . tatilishments, was carefully counted I and the result compared with the ac count in theTreasuiyDspartment. Iuai1 aggregate of about, seven millions of sheets, in receipts by the ngent at the mills, discrepancies were found to the extent of sixty sheets of fractional cur rency paper and for the money value of which thecouipaniesdoing the work are responsible. It is believed that these arrangements furnish better security than has heretofore existed against the fraudulent issueof currency, or other ob ligations of the Government. By the use of(orif>inal diesor plates, and thesystem of the several establishments entrusted with work, will disclose at once any discrepancies in the accounts. It is not probable that the changes made will diminish the expense; indeed, the cost is greater than it would be if the work, in all its branches, were done in the Treasury Department, lu my judg ment, however, the additional security is of more consequence to the Govern ment than was the economy in the ex pense of engraving and printing. i Terrible Death ?r?
