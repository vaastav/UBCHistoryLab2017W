"DO YOUR INCOME TAXING EARLY" IS NEW SLOGAN Bureau of Internal Revenue Urges Filing of 1920 Returns Before Rush Comes. "l>o your income taxing early.'* Taking a leaf out of the boolc of the Christmas shopper, the bureau of Internal revenue is calling attention to the fact that though income tax returns for the year 1920 are not due until March 15, 1321, It is well to avoid the eleventh-hour rush that always marks that date. "The bureau of Internal revenue Is urging taxpayers not to delay in the filing of their returns." says a Treas- , ury announcement. "Merchants and I business men are casting up their ao- 1 counts ior ins calendar year 1920. ' With the facts and 0(Tares necessary i to make a correct return fresh In I their minds, the making- oat of a form soon after January 1 will be an easier ' task than if dalayed/' i Requirements for paying 1920 taxes are the same as those for the year ' 1919, and every person who filed a , return for last year will receive by -I mail a blank form for the present 1 year, but failure to receive and flu out this form will not relieve the person from the obligation of making a return. Revenue officers are to visit ' every part of the United States dur- i ing the next three months to assist and instruct taxpayers in making ont J their tax schedules, and a series of Instructive articles is to be given out I by the bureau, beginning January 3. ' Every single person whose net in- 1 come was (1,000 or more during 1920, < and every married person whose net ' income was (2,000 or more during the i year must file a return, regardless of whether exemptions make It necessary or unnecessary for them to pay a tax. 

LACK XMAS TAGIPIRIT. District Automobilists Very Slow Getting licenses for 1921. District antomobilists are not applying the principle of early Christmas shopping to the purchase of license tags for 1921. The license office at the District building had expected to distribute the bulk of next year's tags before January, but, unless there is a sudden increase la business, this hope will not be realized. This will result In the offloe being swamped with applicants at the beginning of the year, which is unsatisfactory alike to the publio and the municipal authorities. IT T I JIOIDLOIUI O PV^iiHfcVUUVUV Ul M" celiacs Wads H. Combs has procured a stay at execution, so to speak, for delinquents who ha<l not procured their tags whan the now year sot In. But there Is no certaifity that thin leniency will again be shewn, in view of the fact that the new tags have been ready for distribution for some time and the Commissioners have consented to automobilists placing them on their cars immediately and discarding the old numbers. Mr. Combs' office is equipped to disposo of 1,800 tags daily without undue strain on the clerical force, yet the issuance of only 1,100 tags represents the biggest day's business thus far done.
