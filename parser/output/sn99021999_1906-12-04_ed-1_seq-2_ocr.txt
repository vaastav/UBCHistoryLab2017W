FORAKER TO 'START OFFICIAL INQUIRY War Department la Now Preparing for Coaareaalonal Action la Matter of Discharge of Sivr Troopers. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 The War de partment is preparing for an Investigation by ewngresa of-lira case of the companies of the Twenty-rUth infantry, recently dis charged without honor by order of Presi dent Roosevelt, and to this end has com piled 'a record of negro troops dating back to the civil war.- " ' It in salt! that . this , record discloses a state of 'affairs not generally known and that once before at least the Twenty-fifth infantry "iBot up a town." Tl(e' affair'. happened 'tn iss5 at Sturgls, 8. D. Borne of the negro soldiers went on a rampage similar to that. at Brownsville, Tex., and one of. their number killed a cltl- sen. i In that' case,' however, the citisens J took the matter Into their own hands, forced the troopers under pain of death to disclose the name of the man who did the killing and then took him out and lynched him. i First Matter la Senate. Surprise lit up 'the faces of the senators when Mr. Penrose Injected Into the formal opening' ceremony of that body today a resolution of Inquiry addressed to the president regarding the discharge of the three companies of negTO troops of the Twenty-nfth Infantry. When Mr. Penrose said he had a resolu tion for which he should like immediate consideration, Mr. Fairbanks arose, and after hesitating a second, remarked: "The usual rule Is not to consider miscellaneous ; matters until after the message of tho president is received." , "Then,", rejoined . Mr. . Penrose, "I shall ask unanimous consent to have the resolu tion read." - . This was granted. The- resolution fol lows: Resolved, That the president is requested to communicate to the senate. If not In compatible with the public interests, full Information bearing upon the recent order dismissing from the military service of the United states three companies of the Twenty-fifth Infantry, United States troops, colored. Mr. Foraker of Ohio was on his feet at once, saying: "I have a substitute for that in .the fol lowing resolution, and I ask .that it be read and that both lie over." Foraker Wants to K novr. Mr. Spooner secured the re-rtttding of the first resolution and Mr. Warren of Wyo ming asked that both go over. The Fcraktr resolution waa read ut his request. It was addressed to the secretary of war, dlrtcl ing that official to f urnlslr the senate copies of all official letters, telegrams, reports and orders llled In the War department In con nection with the recent discharge of the troops in question, together with a com plete list of the men discharged, showing the record of each, the amount of retired pay each was entitled to under certain SlC tlons of the revised statutes.' The ruling of the department is asked on this or any other similar case regarding the right of . . , ' " the men td such retired pay, also the ruling of the department as to the right of uch discharged men to retire on three-fourths pay, with allowance,' subsistence and cloih- Ins; their rights to enter the national sjl diurs' homes and to be, burle'd.lu a rwit(onai cemetery; to receive subsistence and trans portation from the place "of -discharge' to; homes; also the complete official rec- j j ... ,,-. try from the time of. its muster Into the ; date of the discharge of the companies , mentioned. , Under the various requests that the mat- ter go over nothing further was said after the reading of the resolution. Foraker Talks ton Resolutions. Senator Foraker explained the purposes of his resolution in an interview, as fol lows: The resolution speaks for Itself. I cannot dlBt-uss it. I will say, however, 1 liaic no purpose of raising the race iiueution. The question involved Is broader. It would be untor unate to nave It narrowed Uown by drawing the color line. It concerns white as well as col ored soldiers. it Is a question -of con. aduitioiial power on the one hand, and Constitutional and atattitnrv ritrhin ..n ih ! other.

RECANTS HIS STORY (Continued from First Page.) different pieces of land being pointed out to them at each visit. Intended to Sell Ills Claim. One of the witnesses testifying Monday afternoon was John E. Crlger, called for cross-examination. He stated that he thought he was doing what was right In leasing his entry to the cattlemen and that he was acting in good faith. But on his redirect examination he stated that he did not Intend to live on the land, but when he proved up on it to sell It. Edmund J. Logan of Woodbine, la., an other of the Irving D. Hull colonists, said that Hull told him he could lease the land Immediately on tiling to ranchmen, but he did not know Just who they were. He was prevented from going to the land the sec ond six months because of a bllsaard pre vailing and hence he was never on the land but once. He said: "It was my Intention to comply with the rules of the land ofllce I regarding settlement on the land as I I understood them. Mr. Hull told me actual I settlement was not necessary, but that leas ing the land for grasing purposes was eqlivalent to cultivation. 1 never Intended to make a home on the lund, but merely expected to go down there once In a while so I could prove up." I- Roy Hawes of Council Bluffs, an old soldier, testified that Hull had told him that he could take up a whole section of land, have all his expenses paid and then sell It when he proved up for IM. He visited the land but once. He stated that he had been visited by a United States detective and had given his land papers up to him, "be cause," he said, "I thought be understood his business." Harrison Yount of Woodbine, la., and Abucr H. Livingstone of Missouri Valley were the last witnesses examined in the afternoon. They told In general the same story as the other. The "Twin Mills" sec tion was shown to Ur. Yount once as his section, but' later another piece was pointed aut as his. All the wltnesxes told of vladt- Lng Huntington and lloyt at Qordoa fiavlnf their expenses paid by the former. An effort was msde by the defense to . Introduce affidavits lit nearly each Instance similar to the Campbell affidavit, but ob jections of the government's attorneys was sustained. XEBRASKANS ARE ON DECK (Continued from First Page.) tute.

The contest over the will of Herman Oelrlchs, who died while returning from Europe to the United Stales last June, has not been settled. It was announced a week ago that a settle ment had been effected by .which Mrs. Oel rlchs wap to receive Pacific Coast railway bonds valued at $100,000, and her son the Cygnus estate In California, . valued at $jO,0iX. A decree was subsequently sub mitted to the surrogate for signature, but on account of objections .was not signed. Surrogate Fitxgerald today took the tes timony of the subscribing witnesses to tiie will, and also the testimony of other wit nesses, to prove that the testator, some time prior to his death, had definitely given up his residence in California . and in tended to make his future residence here. According to the. laws of California Mrs. Oelrlchs would be entitled to the bulk of her husband's estate, whereas, under the laws of the state of New York her share would be comparatively small, as the es tate consists almost altogether of personal property and her right of dower would only extend to a life Interest In the real estate. Under the . terms of the wll practically the whole estate goes to Mr. Oelrlchs' brother and sister. . MANICURE 8ET-Frenser, 15th & Dodje.
