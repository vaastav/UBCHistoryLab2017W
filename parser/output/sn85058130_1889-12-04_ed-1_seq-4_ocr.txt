GOVERNOR THOMAS POSITION Some Federal agency should be author I ized to appoint the following county offi cers Selectmen clerks recorders super intendents of district schools and assessors Arthur L Thomas THE PEOPLES POSITION I The basis of free government is the right of the people to govern themselves Peoples Party Declaration of Principles COLONIZATION NEPHI October 28 1SS9 0 If Powers Esq I DEAR SmThe bearer of this wants to vote look after a job for him Jonx WITBECK Toxr Levan Juab co Utah NATURALIZATION At the suggestion of the assistant United States attorney the following notice or order was given m the Third district court on Tuesday Court announces that applications for natural ization will be held by the court hereafter from 10 to 1030 in the morning and from 430 to 5 in the afternoon each day until further notice and the district attorney or assistant is re quested to be present at such times to assist In the examinations and suggestions may be made by attorneys to the district attorney Decent people without regard to poli tics religion or previous condition will be pleased with this radical departure from the ugly if not positively disgraceful order of things which has prevailed in the court during the past few weeks Every body from the mad and fanatic attorney at the bar down to the fellow who s in his countenance and deportment evi dences of having descended directly from the hero of a certain transaction in which thirty pieces of silver figured has been at liberty to take part in the naturalization proceedings the result being the turning of the court into a sort of sensationmaking institution It is proper enough for the court to see that the applicant for citizen ship in the republic is a fit person to be taken into the great American family but it is not proper to invite every whipper snapper in the country to take part in the inquiry nor is it proper to permit the in vestigation to be conducted and directed by personal hatred or political malignity The government attorney is the official to take part in these proceedings The above order having been made the public will hope that it has seen the last of the unseemly scram bles which have characterized so many naturalizations in the Third district court lately THE 

LIBERAL leaders have never found time to explain why it is if their party is in the majority numerically they are so much afraid there shall be a fair contest I All thelBeonle ask is that they be per mitted to cast an honest vote and a party which is in the maority should be willing to contele this THE COMMISSION COMING The secretary of the interior has done wisely in ordering the Utah commission to come to this city Its presence is demanded now more than ever before since the crea tion of the board A vile and wicked con spiracy exists which has for its object first the theft of this city by a gang of reckless and unprincipled adventurers and next the taking of the territory Al ready considerable progress in the scheme has been made and further advance is daily recorded The conspirators have gone so far in their infamous work that only by prompt and effective action can they be thwarted and the only power which can check or defeat the conspiracy is that of the commission The deputy registrars all of whom are active and con spicuous members of the Liberal party and one of whom is a member of the Lib eral campaign committee are working early and late in the interest of their own illiberal organization and against the People As has been frequently pointed out in these columns they are shamelessly neglecting their duties in the matter of house to house vists some of the gentle men having spent days loitering about the saloon and hotels drumming up men who will vote the Liberal ticket while large districts of their precincts are not visited Liberals are registered at their offices in barrooms at hotels on the streetseverywhere in fact while there is an emphatic refusal to register members of the Peoples party at other places than their dwelling houses and to them the deputies do not go or if they go it is at such times as the owners are not likely to be at home In their blind and willful partisanship the registrars are ex ercising judicial functions impudently passing on the eligibility of citizens de claring that citizenship papers were not regularly issued and are therefore invalid striking names from the registration list without authority and doing other things which fair and impartial officials would not do So many have been denied registration so many homes have not been visited and so many names have been arbitrarily and maliciously stricken from the list that it is doubtful if the harm that has been done can be recovered from in the few remain ing weeks before the close of the registra tion The chief registration officer is powerless even if he were disposed to interfere his deputies being bigger men than he in this matter He is such a figure head that one wonders why there is such an office as thatwhich he holds Only the commission can interfere to de feat the outrageous conspiracy and its interference must come at once to be effectual Hence we say that the secre tary of the interior has done well to direct the board to come to Utah where it belongs and perform some of the duties for which it is paid so much money It is to be hoped that the gentle men will not only come but will bring 1 with them an intimation if not direct in f structions that they will be expected i t a to see that the law is carried out in a spirit of fairness without regard to po litical parties If they will be impartial that is all that the People will ask No body on the Peoples side in this contro versy desires more than the carrying into effect of the plain provisions of the law And THE HERALD speaks for the Peoples party and all its members when it declares that victory in the coming contest is not desired by them if it cannot be won honestly and by fair and law ful methods If there is a man in the Peoples party who would accepta victory won in any other way his plane is among the Liberals and the sooner he goes where he belongs the better The community simply asks of the commission that it will bring about a fair and lawful expression of the public will at the ballot when so far as the People are concerned there will be a ready and contented bowing to the wishes of the majority It is expected that the commissioners will reach this city the first of next week when there will be presented to them such a showing of facts as should induce them to either remove all the deputy registrars or compel them to perform their duties as the law requires Is VAIX will the Presidents message be searched for a reference to Utah Can it be possible the Liberal party will ask that this territory which is so great in the eyes of its people cannot be seen from Washington 1 IT is said that the deputy registrars when they read in the morning papers that the Utah commission had been ordered here to inquire into their conduct first trembled and then toncluded that it would be better for them if they were to pay more attention to the requirements of the law and less to the political influences of the Liberal party THE 

WRITING ON THE WALL Can it be possible that any Liberal be lieves from the way things look at present that his cause is being advanced and his interests made secure after hearing that the secretary of the interior at Washing ton has ordered the Utah commission here because of the decision recently made by Judge ANDERsON And if he be so obtuse will he not concede that the absence of even a hint regarding Utah from Presi dent 

HABIIISOX in his first message ought to be considered as evidence of the fact that the ultraLiberal fever has not yet reached headquarters and is not likely to I THE HERALD is charitable enough to be lieve that all of them can read the signs aright can all in fact understand that theta ic a nnint even in governmental and political affairs beyond which the wire I workers for place and profit should not go and the powers that be will not permit them to go Utah of course occupies a very anom alous position among the commonwealths of the land She is not only a dumping ground for all kinds of political bricabrac which the executive has no shelves for else where but it is subjected at nearly stated intervals to just such Johnstown floods of misrepresentation calumny andabuse as the one that has just closed in the im mortal decision Judge AXDERSOX Most people and most communities would have broken down under such a strain long ago but not so here The people are inured to hardships and seasoned to suffering When things dont go to suit them they wait until there is a change when they dont like a particular measure they seek the methods provided by law to drive it out of existence and if they fail they accept the the inevitable with as goodgrace as nature and the weather permits if they dont like a man it is generally the case that it i is not because of his goodness but rather on account of his excessive accumulation of nonsensical dignity and foolish assump tion of powers which at best are undeter mined Is it not sol Well we can all understand that when such things as are herein suggested are permitted to go on day after day and year after year even if those who are afflicted thereby submit quietly that the circum stances will inevitably get up to the cen tral source of authority sooner or later They have before in every case If Utah I were all that the conspirators want it to be in all particu lars it would be different for then they would have it homogeneous as relates to the general government having a full swing and isolated so far as relates to re ports getting up there But the conditions are incongruous they wont mix Having one we necessarily have the other and that other is what with almost periodical regularity downs the bloodand thunder campaigners in Utah It ought to be if it is not remembered by the Liberal howlers that once upon a time a certain whitesouled Judge of Utah peace to his ashes undertook to do just what his successors in excessive zeal and inordinate lust for power have been trying to do In order to do something greater than any of his fellows he consummated a grand achievement in the direction of the tyrannical use of the power by sending an honored citizen of the community to the penitentiary for a purely technical offense The said judge was an intimate friend of the President and yet the latter when he heard the facts in the case removed the official in a few hours after his abuse of authority Putting this and that together would it not be wise for the heelers and howlers hereabout to go just a little bit slower One would think so They have nothing to lose by it and may have a great deal to gain Try it anyway TnE St James Gazette of London says that 

PAKNELL the Irish agitator has mys teriously disappeared not having been seen in his accustomed haunts for several weeks in fact his whereabouts are un known The missing gentleman will doubtless turn up when his presence shall be demanded IT is a long message which President HARRISON sent to Congress on Tuesday This was to be expected It was the gen tlemans first effort and naturally ho would want to spread himself as it were But what we are all more interested in than the length is the quality and this in the main is good As a matter of course there is a decided partisan flavor about the paper and some of his recom mendations are not likely to meet with popular approval or Congressional favor but as to most of the Presidents sugges tions his views are broader and more statesmanlike than most people thought they would be THE
