We learn from the headquarters ot the Army of the Potomac that it was rumored yesterday that a train of wagons, loaded with ordnance stores, en route for the army, via Occoquan and Stafford, hid been captured near the former place, and it is ?arcd that the report may be true. Deserters are ^nstaut'y coming in, but their reports are con noting and unrtliable. It is currently reported Sat Stonewall Jackson has jorfted the forces con fronting us, and has his headquarters eight miles from Fredericksburg. Hampton's T.agion is scour ing the country upon the right of the Union lines and occasionally picking up some of our toldiers. The rebel pickets are eroctiDg substantial houses along the river's edge, evidently contemplating a permanent possession of that locality. Woik upon the r 'bel batteries is still prosecuted vigorously, I &w> additional guns make their appearance daily. 1 Mi ny of oui batteries hare Ix-on protected by eat thworks. and extensive fortifications,command ing th< en-m; * position, are rapidly approaching completion. I'hc health of the troops is very fine, and the roc is are in good order. The prospects therefore , for some immediate active operations ! are cheerful General T . ,-e was examined yesterday in person before the Uou-t Martial trying General Fit/. John Forter on the charges brought against him by the Chief of General Pope's staff. At the conclusion of his testimony Gun rsl Fit/ John Porter offered i In evidence the foil, wing letter of General McClel- j law's, wi'tte to : ui fro; a the 'd'ar Departmental ' Wasliii .r, da.cu "Sej ??milor 1, P.

GKO. D. McULELLAN, Major General. ) The tone of Ibis letter? written under and pe euiiar circ'iinatam es-it will be observed, resem bles close'*, in its patriotic and sell -eacrifii ing Spirit, all that he has since written in an unofficial manner, and all that be lias said in his brief farewell addresses to the army and the people who greeted him on his route to retirement. IDs Toice waa then, aa now, for the Union and the government at all hazards, and without any regard for sell. For the country nnd the army he speaks iWlth all the improesiveueta and vehemence of a (patriot and a soldier; for himself simply he says pot n word. It is said that General Sigel now demands an in meatlgatlon into the statements made by General 'Pope regarding hia conduct, ae embodied in the Report of General Halleck. L The annual report of Mr. Secretary Chase upon Mb# financial affaire of tbe country will probably J>e aent into Congress at its session to-day. The news from the .Southwest is important. Ifjcnrril Gran'telegraphs fiom Abbeville, Miosis. ?ippl, to Genual LUlit.k thai his Uougg art jg possession of that place. The rebels abandoned thoiffort'fications there on the 3d inat., destroy ing all the Btorea they could not carry. The streams were so high that only a portion of our cavalry could cross by swimming; but the enemy waa pursued to Oxford, where, after a skirmish of two hours, sixty of their number were captured. General Grant says that the roads are too bad to get supplies for a long ehase. A fleet of our gunboats on the Mississippi have been running into the creeks and bayous between Ylcksburg and Helena, doing serious damage to the small river craft of the enemy, from steamboats to canoes. Quantities of grain were seised, and arms destroyed wherever found. This expedition has discovered that the stock of cotton of the crop of 1861 remaining in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana has been over estimated, and that the de struction of the staple by the rebels hnB been very considerable. Only a few thousand bales now re main in the counties bordering on the river. The new orop in these regions will be very small, the floods of spring having damaged the fields, and the planters being so disheartened that they are not disposed to pick what is growing. Onr Suffolk and Fortress Monroe correspondence to-day gives a highly interesting account of the re cent nttaok by General Peck's forces, on the Blackwatcr, near Fran) lin. Colonel Spear led the attack, capturing the docket battery which the rebels had previously taken from our troops seve ral months ago, and which had been a source of constant annoyance to General Peck's position for a long time past. The enemy, it appears, had a force of 700 men in action, while our force was only 300. So sudden was the charge of the Eleventh Pennsylvania cavalry that the rebels broke and fled. They were commanded by Gen. French. Not only was the battery recovered, but forty prisoners wore captured, and a large number of killed and grounded, without the loss of a man on our side. It is stated that the enemy have rifle pits alj along the route from Petersburg to Richmond, and strong earthworks in rapid course of con struction. It is also reported, upon what is said to be good authority, that a large portion of the obstructions placed in Charleston harbor is com posed of railroad iron, which is laid in the chan nel between the stone blockade, and that the rebels can use this now valuable material for different purposes. The news from North Carolina contains some in teresting points. Petitions are in circulation there, requesting Governor Stanly to order an efcetion for members of Congress during the remainder of the term. A strong feeling of disgust with the war, and an earnest desire for peace ia experienced in Raleigh. Our troops took possession of Green* ville, on the Tar river, a few days ago. CONGRESS. In the Senate yesterday Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire, offered a joint resolution, which waa laid over, approving of the policy of the Presi dent's emancipation proclamation. Mr. Pomcroy, ?of Kansas, also offered a joint resolution, refer ring the portion of the President's Message that relates to compensntcd emancipation and depor tation of negroes to a select committee of both houses. This was also laid over. A resolution re questing the President t? furnish to the Senate all the documents concerning the operations of tho Army of the Potomac and the surrender of Harper's Ferry, was likewise laid over. A bill repealing the act establishing and equalizing the grade of naval officers, was introduced and appro priately referred. The Naval Committee waa instructed to inquire as to the expediency of submitting the appointments of volunteer naval officers to the Senate for confirmation. The death of the Hon. John K. Thomson, late Senator from New Jersey, was announced, the customary resolutions of respect adopted, and the Senate then adjourned. In the House of Representatives, Mr. Stevens offered resolutions declaring that tlie Union must be ar.d remain one and indivisible forever, and denouncing as guilty of high crime any executive or legislative department that shall propose or advise any acceptance of peace on any other basis than the integrity and entire unity of the United Mates as they existed at the time the rebellion commenced. Tuesday week was, on motion of Mr. Stevens, assigned for the con sideralion of this subject. Mr. Wfoklifle. , of Kentucky, offered a resolution direct ing Inquiry respecting the Military Governor of the District of Columbia?under what law he derives his power, his compensation, the expenses of his office, and whether he ha' obstructed the eivil tiibunals in the administration of justice. A motion to lay the subject on the table was adopted by a vote ol eightv-flve against forty-six. reso* lution abolishing the West Point Military Academy and aiding in the establishment of nrlitury schools in the States was rejected by a decisive vote. After disposing of several unimportant subjects, the death of Senator Thomson, of New Jersey, was announced and the usual resolutions adopted. The House then adjourned. It is stated that the report of the Secretary Of the Treasury will be transmitted to Congress to 

MISCELLANEOUS NEWS. Our European flies by the Hibernian at Portland and t^axonia at this port, contain some very inte resting details of the news to the 2oth of Novem ber, of which an atnple rename appears in the Hkkai.d this morning. A large and influential meeting of merchants wis held at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday to 'evisc means to aid the operatives of Lancashire, England, who are suffering from lack of work, caused by tin- stoppage of tW supply of cotton from the United States. About twenty-six thou sand doHavs was contributed for tins object in a short time. At the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, a letter irom the HecreUry ol the Navy was read, stating that eevcrcl vessels are in search of the rebel pirate steamer Alabama, besides Rear Admiral Wilkes' West India Oeet and ships on the European roast, and that an additional force will be dispatched in'pursuit of her as aoon as practi cable. A resolution was adopted requesting the Navy Department tosend aimed steamers to cruise about the equator on the Brazilian coast, for the protection of American commerce. A resolution thanking President Lincoln for his efforts in be half of the early completion of the Paclffc Rail road. and the enlargement of the New York and Illinois canals, was adopted. Senator Charles G. Cornell and ex-Aldcrman Darragh. appointed by the Board of Aldermen on Monday last to fill the vacancies respectively Of Street Commissioner and Croton Aqueduct Com missioner, took formal possession or their offices yesterday. Mr. Cornell made his appearance at the Street Commissioner's office at noon, when Mr. Knapp immediately surrendered hie insignia of office into the hands of the new incumbent, There waa a tremendous rush of politicians to congratu late Mr. Cornell, and there appears to be a little WicMiatu mom ft* clfriu jeiAtoViA* Uwlr Via ormof offlee. Bat it ia likely no ehaagaa will be aede for a long period, until the pew iaon.abcnt becomes thoroughly posted upon ell his duties. The Board of Aldermen met yesterday at one o'clock. The newly appointed 8treet Commis sioner, Senator Charles G. Cornell, sent in a com" munication requesting that all resolutions directing work to be done by the Street Commissioner may be transmitted to the department without delay. The Finance Committee presented a report, which was adopted, in favor of donating the sum of $50,000 to the Catholic Orphan Aqylam, for-the purpose of erecting a new building. The Board adjourned to one o'clock P. If. this day. In the Board of Councilmcn last evening a reso lution to appropriate the sum of five hundred dol lars to purchase a stand of colora for the Twelfth regiment New York State Militia was laid over. The Board concurred with the Board of Aldermen in adopting a resolution to provide for the defence of the city and harbor of New York. A resolution from the Board of Aldermen to appropriate the sum of one thousand dollars to provide a portrait of Major General McClellan was referred. The Board adjourned until this evening at four o'clock' The regular meeting of the Commissioners of Charities and Correction waa held yesterday after noon?Commissioner Nicholson in the chair. The Committee of the Whole offered their report, whiohwas approved. Four hundred and eleven persons were admitted to the workhouse during the fortnight ending December 4. Several con tracts for the furnishing of meat to the different institutions were swarded. A lengthy report was read from Mr. John E. White, Warden of Bellevue Hospital, in relation to the case of Bookham, who expired shortly after entering the hospital, satis factorily explaining everything in connection with the matter, and exonerating the employes of the institution from all blame. The nnmber of sick and wounded soldiers in Bellevue Hospital is 262. From November 1 to December 1 the receipts were $2,276. The conservative journals of Indiana pretend to have discovered a plot, or a couple of plota, by which the republicans intend to clog the wheels of the 8tate government. One story is that it Ib their purpose to have a sufficient number of the demo cratic members, elected to the Legislature arrest ed and sent to Fort Lafayette to give (he repub licans a majority in both branches. Another is that the republican members elect will absent themselves from the Legislature; and, as the con stitution declares that two-thirds of the members of both houses must be present to transact busi ness, and the conservatives not having that num ber, the vote /or State officers cannot, therefore, be counted, and no business can be done. These discoveries may have some importance attaohed to them; but we are rather inclined to the belief that they are only a scare. The arrest of John H. Harmon, at Grand Rapids, Michigan, and his being Bent off to Fort Lalayette, are creating considerable excitement in Michigan. A few more such arrests, it is said, will turn the State over to the democrats. The Chicago Tribune (abolition) pretends to h tve private Information from this State to the effect that Governor Seymour will recommend in his Message to the Legislature a vigorous prosecu* lion of the war for the restoration of the Union, and that " he will give the sympathizers with the rebellion little cause for rejoicing that he, rather than Wadsworth, was elected.*' A few years ago there were four brothers by the name of Washburae in the United States Con gress?three as Rcyesenlatives, and one occupy ing the position of a clerk. They came from dif ferent localities, but were all born in the State of Maine. There were in Congress from that State three other brothers, named Fessenden?one in the Senate and two in the Houee. The rebel force at Vicksburg is stated by a de serter to be seventy-five thousand old men and young boys, who have been gathered together from the surrounding country. They subsist al most exclusively upon corn bread and molasses. The shock of an earthquake was feltin St. Louis on tbe 30th ultimo. It was also felt afUairo, Illi nois. United States Senator James R. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, is lying quite ill of fever. The Legislature of Vermont adjourned on Wed nesday. 3he stock maiket opened firmly yesterday morning and was quite sir eg until the second board, when nn attempt to realise profits put prices down a 1 per cent all round' There is very little outside buy top as yet. Gold rose at one tlrnn to 1.34, but closed at 132& a 133. Kxchange rose to 147 J-J, but closed at 147. Money was iu active de mand at 6 per cent. The cotton sates were moderate yesterday, but the market was firm. In!!uerced by the rise In gold, prices of hreudslufiS adroi red, four about 10c., wheat lc.ft , and corn lc... with heavy sales. More activity was dis cernible in provisions, mess |?:k (being al $13 37% nn 1 prime lard at OJfc. Sugars sold to tbe extent of 1,300 bbds. at somewhat firn rr prkes. The market wa? inac tive for cofiee, molasses, rice, lens, metals, hemp, fish and naval stores. There was considerable activity in hay, hides, leather and fallow. Whiskey o'o-ed at 39c., with sales ot 800 hbls. The freight engagements were heavier; hut rates showed no improvement. Restoration of the South. In spite of constantly ie< lining deceptions and that deferring of hope which mnketh the heart sick, many still cling to the idea that the restoration of the South is within the oompn*s of the means prepared for its accomplishment by tip* patriotism and energy of tbo people. So it would bo were those means handled with anything like a commensurate earnestness and integrity of purpose by those to whom the deslink's of the nation are entrusted. When, however, we again witness the failure, through the same causes that hampered MeClel lau's movements after the battle of Aatictam< of littrnside's sudden and skilfully projected advance upon Richmond by the way of Freder icksburg, and learn through the orguns of the administration that it is now contemplated to place the army in winter quarters; when we find further in the annual reports of the Navy and War departments such a prodigious waste of resources and such proofs of incapacity and want of concert, we contest! that we lose all hope of a proximate termination to our difficul ties. Tbe dominant party, like the Bourbons, forget nothing and learn nothing. They cannot dismiss from their minds the fact that the war was brought about to enable them to enrich themselves at the public expense, and their past military failures they either will not or cunnot profit by. Under these circumstances we Bee no prospect of anything but a long con tinued outpouring of tbe blood and treasure of the nation. We have, it is true, plenty of good soldiers, good generals and military resources of every kind; but of what actuul aid are they in the suppression of tbe rebel lion as long as they are thus neutralized by factious influences or the prejudices and imbe cility of the ruling powers? And tbo fanatical spirit in which the legislation of the last session of Congress was carried on leuves no hope that tbe measures of the present one will do anything towards bringing about a disposition towards submission on the part of tbe rebels. The manner in which the philanthropic and patriotic recommendations of (lie President's Message in regard to slavery have been received by the radical organs is, in fact, a sufficient proof that there is to be no relaxation of the uncompromising and vindiotive temper in which the Confiscation bill was passed. What 9*1 V* *??* saaguins ie? in all this for*speedy termination to oar trouble?? Do they imagine that overture* will come from the revolted State* whilst they see the adminis tration divided in sentiment, our generals at loggerheads and our arm* "paralyzed by mis management and the interference of the poli tician* ? And how still more remote will be the chances of peaoe, when, to the mischievous legislation of last session, will be added fresh measures of proscription and persecution, all calculated to postpone indefinitely the re storation of those blessings which we formerly enjoyed in common with the people of the South. Were even the winter campaign promised us under Burnside, and now become a stupendous failure, owing to the upardonable blunders of the War Department, to be attended with one or more victories, tbey would not bring us any nearer to our object, unless prefaced or followed by such declare" tiona on the part of Congress as would inspire the revolted States with confidence in the cqui' table disposition of the government We have no more doubted that there is plenty of Union feeling at the South, and that the rebels would be glad to get rid of the grinding tyranny of Jeff Davis, than that the conservative feeling of the North would one day rise up and overturn the equally detestable despotism of the radicals But to render this latent loyalty at the South of use to us, we must give it assurances that its rights will be respected. I?et the present ses" sion pass away as the last one did. and we shall make no progress towards the suppression of the rebellion. Even should Richmond fall, the rebels would still carry on the war a Voutrance, disputing with us every Inch of territory. And what, meanwhile, is the prospect before the North? Increased taxation to meet an in creased debt, estimated for the ensuing year at more than a thousand millions, a further depreciation of the currency, brought about by the efforts of the government to meet its obligations with fresh paper issues, ^hereby rendering the rich speculator richer, and the professional man and the mechanic poorer, and the still wider spreud of desolation and grief among the homes that have been already so heavily visited. To this period of tribulation and suffering we can only see a remote termination?remote when we take into account these immense sacri fices and the strain upon the public mind in the meanwhile. In the Presidential election of 18G4 the nation will find that solution of its difficul ties which the abilities of its statesmen and the maguitude of its resources have failed to supply To the magnificent conservative majorities that will sweep the North in that contest we shall, under God, be indebted for the restoration of the South. McClellan, Halltck and the Radical Press. The radical journals are exulting ovor the idea that General Halleck'e roport has demo lished General McClellsu. Instead of that, however, General Hallcck has deigpliehod him self, and General McClellan stands before the American people a greater man than they had ever before believed him to be. General HaL lcck, who is a lawyer, and never fought a but tle, has brought to bear upon the case all the ingenuity of the legal profession, while McClel lan's defence has not been put before the coun try at all. Yet such weakness is stamped upon the very fuce of the indictment?so lame and impotent are his conclusions?that tho verdict of the people is unanimous and prompt in favor of the accused and against his accusers. The letter of McClellau proves him to be equally a statesman and a soldier. The report of Halleck shows that be is neither one nor the other. Hal leek's calculations, with tho whole situa tion before him, completely failed. McClellau letter, on the contrary, contains tho most singu lar predictions of the disasters that must follow if Halleck's plan should be adopted; and those predictions were literally fulfilled. It is to be fairly presumed that the success of his own plun would have been equally complete bad the General-in-Chief at Washington listened to his entreat ies to send hiin the desired reinforce ments to Harrison's landing. McCleilan's letter, which is tho most interesting published during the war, proves that ho had the eye of a soldier, and that his combinations were scientific and practical, while Halleck, from his own accouut, appears to have lost, his reckoning, if he had ever made any upon sound military principles. McClellan and the public aro indebted to Halleckfor pub lishing this letter, though it must be confessed that it somewhat damages his reputation as an advocate to have produced such damning evi dence aguinst his clients and himself. Had another letter, written at the Buine 'time to the President by General McClellan?an earnest letter on the political branch ot the situation? been brought to light, it would have been seen that McClellan to .vers as high ubovo the Cabmet in statesmanship ns be does above the General-in-Chief in the art of war. That letter, however, with a host of other curious correspondence, will have to come out before long, and the eyes of thousands will bo enlightened who now "see as through a glass darkly." Groat stress Is laid by General Halleck upon three dates. He says that the order to McClellan to evacuate his position on the .Tames river was issued an the 3d of August; that the battle of Codar Mountain was fought by Pope on the 9th, and McClellan did not leave till the 14th. The question is why McClellan did not go to the assistance of Pope by following or flanking Lee. This assumes tbat the whole of the rebel army in Virginia was at that time behind Jack-' son, at Gordonsvillo. Hut nothing can be further froin the truth. Jackson fought Pope with a flying column, independent of Lee's army; and had the whole rebel army been in the vicinity ofCeJar Mountain, as General Hal leck supposed, not a mail of Pope's force would ever have reached Washington to toll the tale, except as a paroled or exchanged prisoner of war. The great body of the rebel army re. inained at Richmond till Lee was assured that McCleilan's army was actually retreating. The most reliable testimony obtained by the rebel general was from three thousand spios. in the shape of exchanged rebel prisoners, whom the military authorities at Washington bad so wisely sent up tho James river to Richmond during the evacuation of Harrison's Landing. Hal leck no doubt Imagined that Lee was a general as slow as ho proved himself to be at Corintb; but the Virginian turned out quite otherwise, lly the most rapid movements and with the aid of railroads, be overtook Pope's army before it was possible for McClellan to come to hie as. sistance, while Jackson, by a detour, got In his rear. Their nnlted forces badly whipped him, and would have totally destroyed his army but fot (he timely aid of a oortion of General v Mo McClellan's armv, which enabled him to ?scape to the strongly fortified position on the southern bank of the Potomac at Washington. Had Halleck permitted McClellan to carry out his own plan, Lee would not have dared to quit Richmond, leaving behind, as be did, five thousand men. McClellan, in a position which was impregnable, would have held Lee at Richmond or in its vicinity, till, with suffi cient rernforoements and the gunboats, Rich mond would have been taken three months ago, or the whole rebel force defending it would have been captured or destroyed. Jackson's force, too, would have been lost; for, already inferior to Pope's, and afraid to press on against him, he waited for the reinforcements from Lee. Instead of Lee, McClollan would soon have been upon him, and, hemmed in be tween the two Union armies, hp could not have escaped. But upon Halleck'B plan a series of disasters happened. Richmond being relieved of McClellan's army, which was within on;* day's march of it, Leo moved rapidly to the capture of Washington, and, after defeating Pope's army in a severe battle at Bull run, and compelling it to take shelter in the fortifications of Arlington Ileights, crossed the Upper Poto mac with a view to capture Washington oil the northern side, which was of comparatively oasy access. The capture of Baltimore would have followed as a matter of oourse. Thus, not only was Halleck's military judg ment completely at fault, but General McClei lau's fully justified. And Hallcck admitted this to bo the cose. When the government, in despair, recalled McClellan to the command, Halleck confessed that he thought it world not be possible to save the capital?a fact which has net yet Been the light; and no doubt in this Halleck would have been right, and Wash i (ington would have been captured, bad Pope remained in command, or had any of the other generals been placed at tlie head of an army so discomfitted and disheartened. But with Mc Clellan lending it against the foe the easel different. His reply to Halleck was that if 1 worth a struggle, and he would try what could be done. Again, the military judgment of McClellan was clear and that of Halleck was bewildered. Glorious success crowned the brief and brilliant campaign of McClellan in Maryland, after the greatest battle of the war. And what Is the most curious feature connected with this campaign, which drove the enemy out of Maryland and beyond the Rappahannock? McClellan fought it without orders, and acted solely on bis own responsibility. So frightened I were the Cabinet and the military authorities at i Washington that not one of them could be found | when he was about to start for the field. The ! result was that, untrammelled by blundering I orders, his success was complete. His reward was to remove him again from his command. General Halleck says he did not rapidly follow up the victory of Antictam. What did General Halleck do at Corinth, with a magnificent fivwh army of nearly one hundred and fifty thousand men, which had not fired a shot for about two months? Be let Beauregard slip through bis fingers to swell we army at Richmond to such a figure as to forcd McClellan'* retreat a. i cause the seven days' disaster, from whi h sprang all the other disasters that befrl the army of Pope. The rebel generals have obtained great credit for generalship; but had they been equal to their reputation, had thsy slighted the army of General Pope, and pressed on rapidly, in stead of waiting to fight it, through the valley of the Shenandoah, and crossed the Potomac they would have been in Baltimore and Wash ington before aid could have reached those cities from either of the Union armies; and, the capital one? captured, the junction between the two Union armies by way of Alexandria would have been prevented, and the rebel cause would have been triumphant Washington and the Union were saved by the failure of the rebel generals, by Providence, and the masterly skill of General McClellan, alter being as good as lost by the War Department, Halleck and ''ope. In bis report the General-in-Chief shift# worn bis own shoulders the responsibility of origi nally dividing the Army of the Pot'mac, and permitting the enemy in Cull strength to occupy a position between them. But he cannot relievo himself from the blunder of sending so lurge an army as forty thousand men so far from its base of operations, and so near to Richmond that it fell into a trap, while it was not in the power of McClellan to Rave it. Dad Iialleck with drawn Pope's army, numbering 40,000 men, behind the fortifications at Washington and sent them thence by water to McClellan. leaving the 40,000 already around the capital to defend it, and. if necessary, calling even 100,000 militia to reinforce them, Richmond might have been captured in two or tbrcc days, and the General-in-Chief and the War Depart ment would have bcon enabled to tell a ver** different story to-day from that which they have laid before Corgre&9 and the country. Now the question comes up, what has Hal feck done since be arrived from the Southwest!? a general who complaios of the slow opera tions of others. lie assumed the chief com mand on the 26th of July, and he directed the base of operations in the beginning of August to be changed from James river, at Harrison's Landing, twenty-five miles from Richmond, to Aquia creek, on the Potomac, which is seven ty-five miles from the rebel capital. This ia the 5th of December, and the army is not yet advanced beyond Falmouth. So that it takea him four months spent in one blunder after another to get fifty miles farther away from Richmond than the position in which he found the army when he took it in hand. A Contraband for Hntr?A Chance for Grkki.ky's Brmade.?James Ilighgrass, a eon traband, brought on bere with several white prisoners of war some months ago, has re covered from indisposition occasioned by the change of climate. He was captured at Fer nandina, as the property of a Confederate calo nel. The Marshal has received an order from the War Department to provide the poor fellow with a situation and take care of him until he is able to obtain one. Here is an opportunity for the display of the often vaunted philanthropy of the abolitionists. A colored brother now awaits a comfortable home, with plenty to cat and little to do. Apply to Mr- Robert Murray, United States Marshal. Gkn. M<Ci.km.an on tiik Witness Stand.? We notice that Gen. McClellan has been called as a witness before the Court of Inquiry in the case of Gen. MeDowell. The point upon which McClellan will be examined is probably the connection which Gen. McDowell had with the peninsular campaign, and the object of the ax amlnatioa will be to prove that McDowell vm V wflllng to oo-operato with McClellan, bat mm restrained by the War Department The scope of this investigation, therefore, will afford Gen. McClellan an opportunity to put the real facte in regard to his campaign on the peninsula be fore the publio in an official form. We trust and erpeet that he will avail himself of this op portunity. Gen. Ilalleck has already revealed all that needed to be kept secret in the report which we published yesterday, and there is now no g(X>d reason why McClellan should longer remain silent His case is very much stronger than the publio have any idea of, and his state* merits will carry conviction to the most preju diced minds. The War Department has already been impeached by General Hal leek for danger ously dividing the army, and for depriving itself of reinforcements by stopplqg enlistments. General McClellan cannot be accused of attack ing the War Department, therefore, and we hope that he will take occasion to fully complete that history of military mismanagement of which the Prince de Joinville has written the drat chapter, and General Halleck the seoond. Congress sad Use Currency. Now that Congress has assembled, and that Mi time is short, it is expected?nay, demanded? by the country that the two great matters moot deeply interesting at this critical moment to the nation, on which it may be said our welfare and success mainly depend, shall receive, if no! exclusive, at least paramount and immediate, attention. We need hardly say that the two great and most pressing subjects which now claim tho immediate action of Congress are the currency and taxation. Let us hope that the interminable nigger question is now at last set tled and disposed of, and that, having received all the attention possible in the Presidents Message, it will not, be dragged ir.to Congress, at least this session, to the exclusion of legiti mate and necessary Jbusiness. Such are the two questions and matters of business which it behooves Congress to take up forthwith and to arrange and settle on a sound and honest basis. We say bonest, emphatically* because there are in Congress men devoted to sectional, corporation and trading interests who we fear would, if they were able, divert the action of Congress from popular and patri otic action, in view of the great interests of the great people, to special, mercenary and dis honest action, in view of private interests and trading and corporation advantages. Our observations and our fears apply chiefly to the currency question?a question which must be taken up and must be settled by Con gress without delay; for it is certain we cannot go on long as now; we cannot safely be left to drift at the mercy of chance, with the helm In the hand of wild speculation, and the vessel of State headed towards quicluands and breakers. Having hinted to Congress its presont duty and business, we will make a few brief and con cise hints also in reference to the course and direction which its duty ought, we think, tp pur sue. What, we would ask, is our present position in reference to the ourrencyf We have before us the spectacle of two antagonistic powers engage^ in one and the same business?issuing irredeemable paper money. One of these powers is Con gress itself; the other power is a scattered, on connected force of above a thousand banks and trading corporations. The isec > of demand notes by authority of Congress is, it is true, subject to limitation?the will ef the nu^o rity in that body; alBO its notes issued are, II not redeemable in specie, at least convertible into government securities. But the issues ol the other power we have mentioned* now that the banks are relieved from the necessity ol converting their bills into specie at the will ol the holder, are absolutely without limitation This alone and of itself is a great evil to the country?the unlimited issue of irredeem able, irresponsible paper money by more than twelve or fourteen hundred banks throughout the country. When to this great issue, which there is nothing adequate to control, where all kinds of banks, solvent and insolvent, good aal bad, honest and swindling, are all confounded together without distinctiveness, without any ready means of ascertaining which arc genuine traders and which are wildcat swindlers? when to tbis evil of redundant, irredeemable issues is added over and above the issue of many millions of Treasury demand notes, the evil is doubly aggravated. The country, in thle I deplorable situation, may be compared to some respectable gentleman attacked in the streets and knocked down by a gang of rowdies; then, in "t e melee, another crowd rushes forward to i jist Lim; but no one can tell who are bis iilends or who are his enemies; among them all and by them he ia thrown down, jumped upon and trampled mearly to death. Thus it is that, if the United States demand notes are?as we verily h< lieve they are?better ten thousand fold than wildcat paper, yet it makes no dtf f renoe: they stand upon the same level; tbey a: ' in one w rd, like all the others, irreleema *?' < and the whole body together, light and flimsy as the. body Is, combine to effect a weigh! under which the respectable Uncle Sam is be ing cmshed to death. Such is the result of keeping bad company, and of removing the jp roofs and symbols of gentility: the rascal is confounded with the true gentleman; in other words, by the removal of the test of redeem ability, the best banks are uitdistinguishabie from the worst, and the worst paper doits in our midst on the same terms almost as the best. It belongs to Congress to look for and apply tbe proper remedy to this great cril, which is beginning to press heavily upon the w orking and industrious classes. This terrible redun dancy of issue and overflow of )>apor money produces a depreciation of the value of money, and an alarming augmentation in the price of all commodities. The rich can profit by all this and become richer; but tLe' effect upon tbe poor is that their little income, whatever it be, is diminished in value, though nominally the Bame, and they, tbe poor, become poorer. if Congress takes measures to provide for the redemption of its paper issues, the evil, so far as regards one branch of the two issues, would at once vanish and disappear. As to the other branch?the thousand and one banks wbioh are now issuing an irredeemable our* rcncy?wo think that it is the duty and within the power and provieoe of Oongrsse to look to and arrange tbe currency of the na tion. At all events* let Congress proceed al onee to regulate this great, tbis vital question ignoring, for the present at leant, all ether lesa important matters, and let us have a currency on a good basis. Let us be rescuod from tbe daily increasing evils of irredeemable paper. Wo have not time or space to do justice to this subject. We therefore content} ourselves with throwing out a well meant hint and eug> gestion to Congress, to rtfaonoe to the otbec rreet question, it k
