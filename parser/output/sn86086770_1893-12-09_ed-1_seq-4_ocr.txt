The President’s message was nat urally looked forward to with a great deal of expectancy, for until now it had been many years since the Democratic parly had absolute control of congress, with the power to revoke such laws as they had condemned, and to make such laws as they had proclaimed were neces sary for the country’s j rosperity. Being -> sustained by so large a majority of political adherents it was reasonable to expect a message couched itr concilliatory language, with broad and liberal views. In stead of that it is characterized by a censorious and dictatorial spirit. That in dignity and gravity its not comparing favorably with the state papers of Polk, Pierce or Buchanan was not so unexpected to the leaders of the party, as it was vexatious Mr. Cleveland appears best as an encyclopedist, and the reports from the heads of the different depart ments contain much valuable infor mation. The President declares himself in favor of the reinstatement of the dusky Queen of Hawaii, and eon defends to announce to congress that, in case of the consumation of ids desire in this respect, lie will immediately inform them. We also learn from the message that he is in favor of issuing bonds. He endorses the W ilson bill, and takes the unprecedented liberty of adding an item to the bill taxing corporations, without consulting the committee who framed it, and urges its passage without regard for the local distress which might follow its adoption. While hts censures are frequent, and especially of a former adminis tration, yet he unbends enough to express hts satisfaction in the pass age of the repeal bil >y a majority composed of Republicans. He did not forgot to insert in his message another fling at the great soldier element. We have endeavored to fairly present the views of the President as contained in his message, and we iegret that the great array of unem ployed labor, which has mostly appeared since his inauguration, with the impending suffering in consequence, was so far forgotten in this message as to give an un fortunate impression, for it has long been held that home sympathy should characterize the lirst officer iii Ui(> government of a great peo 

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our n'frular correspondent. Washington, D. C., Dec. 4. 18JKI. The Cleveland bill hrm been be fore the public one week and the moHt careful study fnils to find one single redeeming feature therein. It would, if enacted a law, turn over ! the ru am of the American market, I the finest in the world, to European i manufacturers and Canadian farm ers, and ail it offers Americans in | exchange therefor are glittering ! promises of an increase in the for j eign trade of the United Stales, promises w rich are not believed in even bv those who made them. It is admitted that free wool would gut an end to the production of in this country and that free iron ore and coal will cause foreign coal and iron ore to be used exclusively in the neighborhood of every At lantic s< iport, and that American iron ore md e>al will be used no where except at places so far in the interior that the freight will allow them to compete with foreign pro ducts. These are only specimens of the manner in which American indus tries have been treated by this bill. I The same holds good throughout [ the bill. There is hard y i -mg :<• industry of any consequence in the United Stales that is not struck at in some way. And as if that were not evil enough to bo contained in a single bill tins one changes the method of imposing the duty upon many of the articles which it leaves upon the dutiable ii-t from specific to ad valorum, a system which ha been condemned hy nearly every Secretary of the Treasury the coun try has had as one that encourages fraud and puts a premium upon de ception. The bill is dishonest in every way. While purporting to be a tariff for revenue its makers estimate that it would produce 000,000 a year less than the McKin ley law. It leaves the sugar bounty which the democrats claimed to op-1 pose on constitutional grounds, and ' provides for Us continuance eight years, dropping a quarter of a cent each year. The question naturally arises, how can a bounty of 1 3-4 cents be constitutional if a bounty of 2 cents was unconstitutional. There is, however, one consoling lldng about this bill. It is so ut terly had and vicious that it cannot possibly become a law in its present shape, although Mi. Cleveland's power may be sufficiently strong to force it througli the house with out amendment, but of that there are doubts. The constituents of democratic members who will feel the reduction in wages ad loss of employment will make themselves heard and fell as soon as they are brought to a realizing sense of the injury to themselves that is contain ed in the bill. Many believe that the hill has been made public in its present shape to feel the public pulse, and that the features wnicii prove most obnoxious will later on be eliminated or modified by a democratic caucus. The report of liie republican minority of the House ways and means committee, upon which work in now being pushed, promises to boa document that will make republican converts by the thousand. It will probably be ready by Hie first of next week or soon after. '1 lie democrats of tbe ways and means committee are still undecided about a single feature of the in ternal revenue bill which they will have to prepare to meet the big deficiency created by their tariff bill. They wish to include the in come lax, but so many vigorous j protests hive been filed against it by leading democrats that it is not certain they will. Secretary Herbert, not having a non to take care of, has introduced anew variety of nepotism by appointing his son-in-law chief clerk ' of the navy department. It is certain that Mr, G. 1). John son, of Louisiana, who was the only 1 democratic member of Ihe Civil ! Service Commission, did not enjoy j lus Thanksgiving dinner. Cause; why? He was peremptorily retnov ed from office by Mr, Cleveland I last week. Mr. Johnson has ever; since the democratic administration j Came into office acted as though he i thought it was his duly to stand by j the most outrageous violations of the civil service law, in favor of democrats, rather than to enforce j that law. He has been going from bad to worse in that direction, and when the time came to prepare the annual report of the Commission, which is now in the bands of Mr. Cleveland, there was an open rupture between him and hts repub lican colleagues, and he refused to i sign their report and wrote one of his own. That brought matters to ; a crisis and Commissioner Uosse. velt told Mr. Cleveland that he would not remain on the Commis sion if Johnson did, and Johnson didn’t. I’rof. Proctor, of Ivy., has been appointed to the vacancy. A Leaf from Life in Wisconsin. Evening Wisconsin Here is a story of Wisconsin poli : tics that has waited a year for its point, but it lias not waited in vain. Late in October of last year ex ; Senator Spooner addressed a politi cal gathering in the Opera House at j Hurley. His audience was made up of wage-earning miners and mine workers to whom, in part ho said: “You are to-day receiving larger wages than are piid to men in like employment in any other country on earth. Work is as abundant as wages are high, and every man who will may have employment. Ami now 1 give you w arning: If, aided by your votes in the coming election, the national Democracy is returned to power, then within one year the work people of this range will be looking for bread in the streets of Hurley.” “O, John!” said some of the timid Republicans after the meetings, “we hoped you w ould put it strong, but we didn’t expect you’d lose your - bead. One year! Why, man, no imaginable political disaster could possibly stop j lbi- humming movement of nidus- j try as quickly as that. In two or three years, perhaps; but in one year nonsense!” And John only replied, “Wait!” I£ow the year lias elapsed, and now the prophecy has been literally and distressingly fulfilled. Within the past week a democratic Governor, hacked by the generosity of a gener ous stale, has stood in the streets of Hurley distrubuting bread and meat and clothing to the very men who a vear ealier gave skeptic ear to the Spooner prophecy—being then well to-do; being now destitute. U idle acting a the almoner of AN isconsin charity did it strike our Democratic governor that the Demo cratic triumph of November, ’92, and the people’s destitution and hun ger of Nov '93, stand in the relation of cause and consequence? It lias so struck tlie people of Hurley; and the people of Hurley may be trusted to remember. Revelation About Mortgages. Oshkosh Northwestern. For many years, and especially during recent political campaigns, much has been said about the enor mous mortgaged indebtedness of farms. One of the favorite features of the calamity howl of Democratic and Populist speakers during the last two campaigns has been the dismal pic ares of the agricultural debt, i’he usual declaration was that nine-tenths of the farms of the country were mortgaged for all they worth. Dark and dreary ac counts of the condition of the agri cultural ciasse- were spread broad cast in order to induce the fanning communities to vote witli the Democratic party in favor of a change, as though a Democratic administration at Washington was going to pay off ail the farm mort gages in the prairies of the west. But the almost completed compila tion of returns of the census of 1890 on the item of mortgages has revealed a startling array of facts which silences tins exaggeiation about agricultural indebtedness. These compilations have already in cluded returns from thii ty-three states, and as far as tney have al ready gone they make a most in teresting showing. The following are some of the astonishing facts which this compilation of census returns presents: 1 hree quarters of all the farms in tin? United Slates are free of en cumbrance, and only one-fourth of the total number of farms are mort gaged. Of the farms mortgaged, the average face of the mortgage is only one-third the average value of the farms. Thus it is shown that instead of nine-tenths of the farms being mortgaged for all they are worth, is lias been often asserted, we find that only one fourth of them are mortgaged at all and that one-fourth are mortgaged for one third their value. The census re turns show still further, that farm indebtedness is decreasing in pro portion to total indebtedness on real estate. Four-fifths of the amount ot debt on barms was in curred for the purpose of buying and improving ihe property and u.is spent upon the properly, so that the value may be said *o have increased to the full amount >f the indebtedness incurred. Certain it is that enough lias been set forth herein—most of it lor the first lime - -to demonstrate that the facts about farm mortgages have been grossly distorted and ex aggerated.
