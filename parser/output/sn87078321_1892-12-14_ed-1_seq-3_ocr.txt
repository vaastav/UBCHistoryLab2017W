The progress, both in ships and ordnsnn ', by which the C luted (stales ims emerged from its condition ot helplessness at ten. ami by the employment of iis own resources, ha distanced its more experienced competi tors, marks nn epoch in the naval develop ment not only ot this country but of the world. On the subject of armour plate tests the report snv that alter a lows leries of tests, a high decree ol 'superiority was tinally reach ed. A nickel plate, uiniinfncturcd by Cur ncgie, iinoer the rolling process, showed n narked superiority over the all steel plate, and both it and a corresponding llerhlchem, Pu , plate ahnwtd h capacity ot resilience to penetration nenriy 10 jier cent. greu'er than ( lint, of the Freii'-h all steel piste. The high carbon nickel Harvey plate was not on.y the best of all the plates tested but Ihe best armor plate ever subjected to ballistic test up to this time. Never before these trials Mel nny nrinor f late in the world been subjected to such a test as was if presented by theie blows of k total energy of 2;,u00 toot tons, 't he result may he told in n word.

The number of high-powor Rims in use on vessels in commission or ready for use, is 2,'i", 77 nre p rtly completed and 110 arc atlnat. There Is every reason to believe thnl the smokeless powder now used will entirely le place the ordinary powders in all guns of smaller caliber, mid that its use willgradu ally lie extended up to the largest calibers. During the past year 1,600 pounds of this powder have been made at ttie loipedo sta tion nt Newport. Tho important characteristics of Kmnien site as a high explosive nre still the subject of experiment. For this purpose a six-inch wire-wound (tun was used, and shells tilled with Kminensite hnve been tired from this gun with a velocity of 2,000 foot-seconds that exploded on impact with water at f range of H.OuO yards. Concerning tne I mure needs ot the navy tho Hecreiury says: "To regnin th relntivs position nraoni these navies we occupied prior to our Civil War is certainly not too nioch to attempt especially ns we know now that we have no such ellicient const deleuces ns we then believed ourselves to possess. To reach this (mint it is not disputed that we need more first cluss bnttle shins. We have now onlv three authorized. Kijjlit or nine more of these, in addition lo our uuthoriss d fleet, would Rive us a respectable navy, suHicient, perhaps, for our put poses."

MONETARY CONFERENCE. An International Union to Regulata tht Value of BUver. Contrary to expectations, the special coro mlttea of the International Monetary Con ference on thj lioth-child and other plant met again at Brussels and discussed tbe pro posal of the Danish delegate Tietgen, wbo propones to constitute an international Union to fix the relative value of gold and silver, based on the average price of silver recorded in London, during the year pre ceding the foundation of the Union. A committee representing three or five fitates is to watch the cours of the silver market, and ihould the market fall 6 per cent, below the rale previously fixed, ac cording to th average in London for tin previous three 5r six months, the commit tee may summou Ihe conference to deckle whether there ihould be a reeoiuage.

Secretary of the Treasury Foster submit ted his annual report to Congress, Wednes day. His statement of the condition of ths Treasury, with estimated revenues and ei penditures for the years 1803-4 ar given it the President's message. Regarding a possible deficiency in the Treasury, the report snys; "A careful review of all the facts mllv Jiistilles the opinion that the large incresse of receipts ascribed to tlie msrvelous prosperity of th country under the present revenue st stem would, if continued, enable the department, during the coming liscsl ynirtomeet nil obligations without the slighest Impairment of its cash and thereafter continue to show a mnleiial improvement In its condition.'1 Secretary Foster recommends the nncondl tlontl tepenl of the sinking liind laws as ' It is hordlv prob ible thnt more than nlmnt ir.nuo.OUO can be credited to the fund during the present lisc.il yew, ns against a legal re ipilreniciit exeee ling t Is, no ,o and fuith -r uppl cations to the fund du lug snecei'ding years must necessarily ho limited to such small sums ns may f rum time to time be paid for past due bonds, fraciional cuirency ami national bank imtes redeemed under the net or .inly It, istw." One of the embiirrnssmenls to the Treas ury, in the opinion of the Secretary, is the inability, wuh the limiied amount of cash on hand nbovethe loo.msi.o.l i ieserve, to keep up a mtlh ieut gold supply, "When the demand couns Tor the expoi-ranou of gold,' says he, "(he Treasury is culled Umiii id furnish It. If this demand should prove to be as large the coming yen ns it lins been for the past two yenis, gold ill the 'Treasury vonld be diminished to or below the re serve line. "If int.OJO.OOO in gold was a suitable or necessary reserve in IXM and in 1HS., it wi.uld seem clejr that n greater reserve Is necessary now. it shou d be renioiuh red that since ls e have added to our silver circulation the stun of .'.ili.OIO.

The Volume of Trade for tho Past Week Reviewed. P.. ft. Dun fc Co.'i Weekly licvicw of Trade snys: Utittnesi shows no decrense, except thnl slackening in new transactions, which It customary ns the holiday season draws near. The volume of payments Is as large as it ever lins been, and industries, on the whole, more fully employed than ever at this time of the year. The apprehension of monetary disturbance from exports of gold has not yet been rrnllzed, and seems snmewhnl more remote ihnn a weik ngo. Interior money mnrkels generally thow a strong de. mntid, though money Is actually close only nt Cleveland, and apparent' rather ensiet at most points, while at Eastern cities the mnrkels nre easier, with a sleekening de mand. At nil points reporting the holiday trade opens more briskly than usual, with pro-pectof a larger volume. The prosects lorSouthern trade nre espee. tally good.

'At Milwaukee money is in strong demand for grain ami live stoe! trades. At St. Paul nud Miuuespolis colder weather is wanted lor collections, but trade Is satisfactory and Wheat receipts very large. At Omaha storms retard business in uroce ries ami hardware, hut dealers cannot keep up with orders in dry goods and shoes.

Al New Orleans trade is giaid, but not ut to expecta tions, and money is only in Inir demand.
