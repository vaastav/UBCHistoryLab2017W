T the Sranle es4 Jfss: f V.tprecnicl)irt : In submitting my Seventh Annual Mes sage to Congress, in the cen'enMal rear of our national existence a a free and inde pendent people, it affords me great pleas ure to recur to the advancement that lias Ireen made from the time of the Colon one huulred rear ago. Ve were then jwople numbering ouly three million ; now c number more tlian forty million : tlieu industries vrtre confii.e.1 almost exclusive ly to tillage of the noil; now manufactures absorb much of the labor cf the country. Our liberties remain unimpaired. The bondsmen havt, Itccn freed from slavery; we hae become posseswd of the rcsiiect, if not of the friendship: ail cirilind nations. Oar progress has been great in the arts, in science, commerce, navigation, mining, mechanics, law, medicine, Vc, and in gen eral education the progress is likewi-e en couraging. Oar thirteen States have be come thirty-eight, including Colorado, which has taken tha steps to become a State, ar.d eight Territories, including the Indian Territory and Alaska, and exclud ing Colorado, miking a territory extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific. On the youth, we have extended to the Gulf of Mexico, and in the nest from the Missis sippi to the l'acif.c One hundred yiars ago the cotton gin, the steamship, the rail icad, the telegraph, the leaping, sewing, m.d modern printing machines and numer ous other inventions cf Latcely lets value to our business and happiness, were entirely unknown. orn cheat rnouKiH-. la 1770, manufactories scarcely existed, even in name in ail this vast country. In 1S70, more than i!,0OJ,00v peisons were em ployed in manufacturing, producing more than two tbou-Mid one hundred millions of dollr.rr. of pri-di.ee, an amount, auuujlly, nearly equal to our National debt.

In connection with this impor ' tatit question, I would call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil, which, if permitted to continue, will lead' to great trouble in our land before the i-Iosc of the Nineteenth ctntnrv. It is the accumulation of vast amounts of" rxTAXEti era-cat rnorouT.

Oar relations with moil ot the rocnGS ioweus continue on a satisfactory and friendly foot ing. Increased intercourse, extension of commerce, ai.d the cultivation of mutual interests have improved our re lation with tbe large majority of the pow ers of the world, rendering practical the peaceful solution of quotums which, from time to time arise, leaving few which de mand extended orparticular nolice. Corres pondence of the Department of State with our diplomatic representatives abroad, is transmitted herewith. I am happy to announce the parage of an act by the General Cortes of Portugal, proclaimed fir.ee the adjournment of Con uress, for the AiioiJTios ok tEaviTrnr. ;nljje Ioriiigiie colonies. It is to be hoped that such legislation mav le auoth or step toward the great consummation to bo retched, when no man shall be iftrmit ted, directly or indirectly, under any ex cuse or form of a law, to hold his fellow- man in Iwndage. J am ot the opinion, al- t . '"at it is the duty of the United States, as coninouung toward mai enu, t anu re quired by the spirit of the age in 'which we live, to provide, by suitable legislation, that no citizen of the United- States tliall hold slave, a property, in any other coun try, or be interested therein. Chili has made reparation in the case of the whale ship, "Good .Return," seized, without suufficient cause, upwards of forty year ago, though she had hitherto DENIED UEB ACCOUNTABILITY, the denial was never acquiesced in by this Government, and the justice of the claim has been so earnestly contended fur that it has been gratifying that the should have at last acknowledged it. The arbitration in the case of the U. S. steamer Montjoy for seizure and detention, for which the government of the United States of Columbia was held accountable, has been decided in favor of the claim. This deci-iou has settled a question which bus been pending for several vears, and which, while it continued open, might have more or less disturbed the good understanding which it is desirable should be maintained between the Republics. , A reciprocity treatv with the King of the HAWAIIAN ISLANDS was concluded the same month. As it con tains a stipulation that it shall not go into effect until Congress shall enact tlie proper legi-lation for the purpose, copies of the intniment are herewith submitted, in or der that, if such should bejhe pleasure of Congress, the nece-sary legislation upon the subject may be adopted. ocit helatio.vs wrni SPAIN. Ill March last, an arrangement wasmade, through Mr. Gushing, our Minister in Mad rid, with the Spanish Government, Tor the payment, by the latter, to the United States, of the sum of SSO.OOO in coin, for the purpose of the relief of the families or persons of the ship's company, and cer tain passengers of the viuatxius. This sum was to have been paid in three installments at two months each. It is due to the Spanish Government that I should state that the payments were fully and speedily anticipated by that Government, and that the whole amount was paid with in but a few days more than two months from the date of the agreement, a copy of which i herewith transmitted. In pursu ance of the term of the adjustment, I have directed the distribution of the amount among the parties entitled thereto, in cluding the ship's company, and such of the pa.-engers as were American citizens. Payments are imrfe accordingly, on application of the parties entitled thereto. The paper has funiLdieil no evidence of an approaching end to the ruinous conflict which has lieen Mging for seven years in the neighboring ISLAND OF CUBA. The same diregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of humanity, which have heretofore called forth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Chrstian lands, have contiuued to blacken the sad scene. Desolation, rain and pillage are pervading the rich fields of one of the mot fertile and productive regions of the earth, and the incendiary's torch firing the plantations and valu able factories and buildings, is the agent marking the alternate advance or retreat of the contendirg parties. The COXnXCANCE OF THE 6THIFE scriou-ly effects the interests of all com mercial nations, but those of the United States more than all others, by reason of its clo-s? proximity, its larger tra'de and intcr-conr.- with Cuba, and frequent and inti mate personal and social relations which have grown up between its citizens and tho-eof the irland. Moreover, the proper ty of cur citizens in Cuba is large, and is rendered insecure and depreciated in Tal ne and incapacity of production, by the continuation of the strife and the unnatur al mode of its conduct. The same is true, differing only in degree, with respect to the interest and people of other nations, and sb-ence of any KEASOXACLE ASPUaAXCK of a near termination of the conflict, must, of recMsitVjSoon compel the State thus suffering to consider what the interests of their people and their duty toward them selves may cemanu. 1 have hoped that Spain would be enabled to establish ieace in her colony, to afford security to the property and the interests of our citizens, and to allow a legitimate scope to trade and commerce,. and the national produc tions of the island. Because of this hope, and from an extreme reluctance to inter fere, in the mo-l remote manner, in the affairs of another and friendly Nation, es Ieci3lly of one whose sympathy and friend ship in the struggling infancy of our exist ence mu't ever be remembered with grati tude. 1 have patiently and anxiously waited the progress of events. Our own civiL conflict is too recent for us not to con sider the difficulties which surround a Gov ernment distracted by a dynastic rebellion at'homc, at the same time that it has to cope with a separate insurrection, in a dis tant colony. But whatever causes may bave produced the situation which so grievously affects our interests, it exists with all attendantevils, opera ting directly upon this country and its people. Thus far, all the KESOItTS OF ETA1X have proven abortive, and time has marked no improvement 'in'lhe situation. The armed bands of the other side now occupy nearly the same ground as in tlie past, with the difference, from time to time, of more lives sacrificed, property 'destroyed, a wider extent of fertile and productive helas, ana more valuable property, con stantly and wantonly sacrificed by the. in cendiaries of each. In contests ol this' na ture, where" considerable body of people, who have attempted to free themselves of the control ot the superior government, have reached each a point in the occupa tion of a territory, in power and general or ganization, as to constitute, in fact, a body 'politic, having a government in substance, as well as name, possessed of tbe elements of stability, and equipped with machinery, for the administration of internal policy and the execution of its laws, prepared and able to administer justice at home as well as in its dealings with other powers. It is nitkin the province of those other powers to recognize it in its existence as a new and indeendent nation. In such cases other natiuns simply deal with an actually ex isting condition of thing, and recognize it as one of the powers of the earth. That poli:ic body which, possessing the necesrj element, has in fact become a new power. In a word, the creation of a new 51315 is, in fact, to establish the corditicn of things XSSEXTIAL TO THE JUMOGXITSOX of tliis fact.

While conscious that the insurrection in Cuba hxs shown a strength and endurance which make it at least doubtful, whether it be in the power of Spain to subdue. Itreems un questionable that no euch civil organiza tion exists, which may be recognized a an independent government, capable of per forming its obligations and entitled to be treated as one of the powers of the earth. A tivukvu o vu, i tilt, ivntio VI fclaQ Cl rfl. recognition under such circumstances would be inconsistent with ihe facts, and would compel the power to give support by force, to the government to which it really gave its only real claim of exUtence. In my judgment, the United States should adhere to the policy and the principles which have heretofore been its sure and safe guides in like contests, between revolted colonics and their mother country, and acting only upon the clearest evidence; should avoid any possibility of suspicion or imputation. A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in ciy opinion, impracticable and in defensible, the question which next presents itself, is that of the recognition of belliger ent rights, in the parties to the conti'.-t. In a former message to Congress, I had oc casion to consider this question, and reach ed the conclusion that the conflict in Cub::, dreadful and devastating as were its evint., did not rise to the FEAKFCl. lUGXrrr OF V7AR. Regarding it now, after this lap-e of time, I am unable to see that any reliable suc cess, or any marked or real advance on the pari of the Insurgents, has essentially changed the character of lhc contest. It has acquired greater age, but not greater or more formidable proportions. It is possible that the action of foreign powers, and even of Spain herself, of this very na ture, might be pointed to in defense of euch recognition. Rut now, a in its past history, the United States should carefully avoid the false lights which might lead it into the maizes of doubtful law and of questionable propriety, and adhere" rigidly and sternly to the rule which has been its guide, and doing only that which Is right and honest and of good report. The question of according or with holding tlie rights of lielligercncy, must be judged in every case in view of the particu lar attending facts. Unless justified by ne cessity, it is always, and justly, regarded as an unfriendly act, and a gratuitous demon stration of moral support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is required, when the interests and rights of another government, ot of its people, are so far affected by a pending civil conflict as to require a defin ition of its relations to the parties thereto, but this conflict must be one which will be recognized in the sense of 

IXTEEXATIONAI. LAW as belligerent too. It is a fact that the mere expense of maintaining armed bodies, and their occasional conflicts, do not consti tute law in the sense referred to. Applying the existing condition of af fairs in Cuba, the tests recognized by pub licists and writers on international law, and which have been observed by nations of dignity, honesty and jiower, and when free from sensiliwe, selfih or unworthy mo tives, I fail to find in die insurrection the expense of keeping a substantial, political organization, real, palpable and manifest to the Vorld, having the forms, and capable of the ordinary func tions rtf a government towani its own people and to other States, with the courts for the administration of jus tice, with a local habitation, possessing such organization of force, sueh material, uch occupation of territory as to take the con test out of the category of a mere rebelli ous insurrection, or occasional skirmishes, and place it on the terrihlc footing of war. which a recognition of beligerancy would aim to elevate it. The contest, more over is solely on land. The insurrection i not posecd of a single seaport, whence it may send forth its lias, nor has it any means of communication with foreign pow ers, except through the military lines of its adversaries. No apprehension of any of thce sudden and difficult complications, which a war upon the ocean is apt to pre cipitate ujKin the vessels, both commercial and national, and upon the consu'arofficer of other powers, calls for the definition of their relations to the parties to the con flict. ACCOIitlAXCE OF EEUV.OEKLXT KIGlrTS UX- Considered as a question of exjiediciicy, I regard the accordance of belligerent rights still to be unwise and premature, and re gard it to b?, at proem, indelensibl?. As a meai-ure of right, such rccoiiilion entail's upon the country, according to the rights which How from it, difficult and i-om-plicatcd duties, and requires the action from the contending parties of the strict observance ot their rights sud obliga tions, it confers ihe right of search upon the high seas by vessels of Iioth parties, it would subject the carrying of arms and ammunition of war, which now may be transported freely and without interrup tion in the vessels of the United States to detention and to poible seizure, it would give riie to countless vexatious question, would release the parent government from resjionsibility for acts done by the Insur gents and would invest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognized by our treaty of 1795, over our commerce on the high seas. Avery large part of which in its traffic between the Atlantic and Gulf States, and between all of them, and the state s upon the lacihc, passes through the wn ters which wish the shores of Cuba. The exercise of this supposition could scarce fail to lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to tiie peaceful rela tions of the two States. There can be little doubt as to what result such supervirion would, before long, draw this nation. It would be unworthy of the United States to inaugurate the possibilities of such a re volt, by measures of questionable right or expediency. I am satisfied that while the accordance of belligerent rights to the In surgents in Cuba, might give them a hope and an inducement to protract the struggle, it would be but a deluive hope, and would not remove the evils which this government and its people are experienc ing, but would draw the United State into complications, which it has waited long and already suffered much to avoid. The recognition of independence or of bel ligerency being thus, in my judgment, equally inadmissible. It remains to con sider WHAT rOIJCY SHALL BE ABOITEn. Should the conflict not soon be brought to an end by the acta of the parties themselves, and should tbe evil which result there from, affecting all nations, and particularly the United States, continue, in such event, I am'of opinion that other nations will be compelled to assrnne responsibility which devolves upon them, and to sensibly consid er theonly remaining measures possible, mediation and intervention. Owing, perhaps, to the large expanse of wafer separating the island from the peninsula, the want of harmony and of personal sympathy be tween tne lnnamiants ol the colony and of those sent thither to rule them, and want of adaptation of the ancient colonial system of Europe to the present times, and to the ideas which the events of the past centnrv have developed, the contending parties ap pear of common confidence to suggest to them, wnen passion affil excitement have their sway, and to assume a part .of peacemakers- In this view, ix the eably r.urr of the contest, the good offices of the United States as a mediator, were tendered in gocd faith, without any selfish purposes, but in the interest of humanity, and i.i sincere friendship for both jiartifi, but were at the tinw declined by Spain uith the declaration, nevertheless, that at a fu ture time they would be indispemdble. No Intimation has been received, that in the opinicn of Spain, that time has lecn reach ed, end yet the strife continue, with iu dread horror-, and all its injuries to tlie intere-ls of the United State, nnd of oth er nations, and each of the parties seera quite capable to work great injury and I damage to the other, as well as to the re-1 lationsacd interests dependent on the exist-' mation.

At the same time, while impressed, I do not rec ommend the adoption of any measure of intervention.

It is due to Sp!in, as far as the govern- ' . . , . , - ; nt i concen.ed. to say that the agency of a tbiid power, whiUi has been adverted to. shall be adopted only a a last expedient. Had it beeajhe desire of the United States to interfere in the affairs of Cuba, repeated opportunities for so doing hae been pre sented within the last few years; but we have remained passive, and havss perform ed our whole duty, and all international obligations, to Spain, with friend-hip. fairness and fidelity, and with a spirit of patience an'1 forbearance which negatives ever.- pible suggestion of a desire to in terfere or to add to the dilficulties with which she has been surrounded. The gov ernment of Spain has lecently submitted to our rainb-tcr at . Madrid, "certain pro inwIs which may be found to bo the ba-i, if not the actual submission of terms u, meet the requirements of the particular grief of which this govern ment has felt itself CUAEll TO COMI-LAIX. The.-e proposals have not yet reached me in fulltext. Ou their arrival, they will be taken in careful examination, and may I hoje, lead to a satisfactory adjustment of the questions to which they refer, and re move the po ibility of future occurrences, such as have given rise to our just com plaints. It is understood that renewed ef forts are being made to introduce reform, in the internal adrnini-tration of the Is land. Persuadtd, however, that a proper regard for the interests cf the United States audits citizen, entitled to relief from the strain to which it has been subjected by thc difficulties of the questions and the wrongs and losses which arise from the con Ust in Cuba, and that the interests of hu manity it-elf demand tho o-ation of the strife, U'fore the whole Island shall lie laid waste, and larger sacrificis be of life made; I shall feel it my duty, should my hopes of a sati-factory adjustment and of the ear y re storation of p?ace and the removal of" fu ture cau-es of complaint, lie unhappily dis appointed, to make a further communica tion to Congress, at some period not far re mote, and during the present e-sion, rtc ommending what may then seem to me to be mcessary. THE 

FKEH ZOXr, so-called, several years since, established by the Mexican governmtnl in certain of the states of that republic, adjacent to our frontier, remains in full oi-cration. It has always been materially injurious to hoi.est traffic, for it operates as an incentive to traders in Mexico to supply, without cus toms charges, the wants of "the inhabitants on this side ul rhe line, and prevent the same want.VfjTia being supplied by mer chants of HjeUnitcd State, thereby, to a considerable extent, defrauding our reve nue, and checking honest commercial en terprise. Depredations by armed bands from Mexico, on the people of Texas, near the frontier, continue. Though the main object of these incursions is robbery, ;hey frequently result in the murder of "uuarni ed ami iieaceablylisjM).ed peron, and in some instamA even the United Slates js-it-oiHces and mail rjmmunications have btcn attacked. Jnewed remor.strai.cts ujion this subject have U-ca addressed to the Mexican government, but without much apparent effect. Tlie mail foice of this government, disposable for service in that quarter, is quite inadequate to cifectually guard Ihe lines, even at thoe points where the incur-inii' are usually Iliads. An cx iicrimcnt of an armed vessel, on the Rio Grande, for that purjiose, is on trial, and it i- hoped that, if pr.t thwarted by the shallowness of the river, and other natural c.lw:rr.ction, it may materially contribute to the pixTetT.ox of tiic hesd-iiex or texas. The proceeding! of the joint committee, under the convention between the United States and Mexico, of the-lth of July, ISOi, on tho subject of claim, will soon be brought to a c!o-e.

THE H.ECTK5t TIXWJKAWt ia become an es-scntial and indi-pensible agent in the transmission of business and tolid mexage-. Its operation on land and within the limit of particular States i r.ec et.sarily under control of the jurisdiction vrithin which it operates. The lines on the high sea, however, are not subject to the particular control of any one government, in ISO'.l a concession was granted bv the French government to a companv "which proposed to lay a cable from the shores of France to the United States. At that time thero was a telegraphic connection between the U. S. ar.d the Continent of Europe, through tho oscs.s!ons of Great Britain, at either end of the line, under the control of an association, which had, at a large outlay of capital and at great risk, demon strated the practicability of maintaining such means of communication. THE MEANS OF COHRESrOXDEXCE by this agency was great, possibiy not too large at the time for a proper remuneration for so costly an enterprise, bat it was a heavy charge upon the means of the com munication, which progress in the social and commercial intercour-e of the world was found to be a necessity, and the obtain ing of this French concesion showed that other capital than that already invested was ready to cnler into com petition, with tho assurance of an adequate return for their outlay. Impress ed with the conviction that the interests not july of the people of the United States, but the world at large, demanded or would de mand the multiplication of such means of communication U-tween the separate conti nents, I waj de-irou that the proposed con nection should be made, but certain pro visions of this concession were deemed by me to lie objectionable, particularly the one which gave, for a long period of ) ears, the exelu-ive light of telegraphic communica tiou, by hi'L-mariue cable, between the shores of Frai.ce ami the United States. I could not concede that any power should claim the right to land a cable on the shores of th.; United States, and at the same time deny to the United States, or its citizens, or gn.ntcisr.li iqual leght to land a cable on its shoies. T.ie light lo control con nections for the laying of a cable within the jurisdittii ii.tl wa'ers of the United Slates to cox.-tEcr ot i: s-i!oi.ju wilii those of any foreign state, jicrtains ex clusively to the Government of the United States. In the ab-enca of legislation br Congress, I wo? unwilling, on the one hand", I to yitld ugtcr.'ign states the right to say its grantees might land on our shores, while it denied a similar right to our peo ple, to land on its shores : and on the oth er hand, I was reluctant to deny to grant ees, the intere-ts of the world, and of civil ization, the facilities of such communication- as were proposed. I therefore with held my objection to the landing of any ca ble, on condition that the offensive monop oly feature of the concession be abandoned, and that the right of any cable, which mar be established by this Government, to land on French territory, and to connect with French land lines, and enjoy the necessary facilities incident to the ue thereof, upon as favorable terms as ar.v other companyj lie conceded. As a ieult thereof, the com pany renounced the exclusive privilege, and tho represent-itive ot France was in formed that, untler-tanding this relinquish ment to be construed as granting entire reciprocity and equal facilities, of which "ad been demanded, the opposition to the landing of a cable was wrniiKAW The cable, under this French conces-ion, was landed in the month of July, 1S09, and has been an efficient and valuable agent of communication betwien thi country and other continents. It soon pa-ed under the control of these who had the management of the cable connecting Great Britain with this continent, and thus whatever of benefit might have tnsucd from competition be tween the two lines was lost, it having greater facilities of additional lines, and ad ditional security against accident to them. But these increased facilities, and this ad ditional facility, together with tho com bined control of capital of the two coin panics, gave also greater jiower to prevent the future construction of other lints, and to limit the control of telegraphic communi cation between the two continents, to those pose.-i, g the line already laid. Within a few months a cable has been laid, known as the United States direct cable, connect ing the United States directly with Great Britain. As soon as this cable was report ed to be in working order, the rates ot the cxi-ting consolidated companies were great ly reduced. Soon, however, a break wxs announced in this new cable, and immedi ately the rates of the other line which had been reduced, were again raised. This cab'e being now repaired, the rates appear not to 1 reduced by either line from those formerly charged by the other company. There is reason to believe that the large amounts of capital, both at home and abroad, are ready ;o seek profitable invest ment in f'e advancement of this useful and and most civilizing means of intercourse and correspondence. They await, however, the assurance of means and conditions on which they may safely le made. No lines should be allowed to land OX THE SUOltK OF TIIE UXITEI) STATFS under tiie concession from another power which does not admit the right of any other line or lines, formed in the United States, to land and freelv connect with, and ope rate through land lines. Second; no line should be allowed to land on the shores of the-United States which is not by treaty stipulation with the government from whose shores it proa eds. or by prohibition in its charter, or otherwise, to the satisfaction of this government, prohibited from consoli dation with any other cable telegraph line, or combining the rights, for the purjoe of regulating and maintaining the cost of the telegraph communication. I present this subject to the consideration of Congress, in the meantime, ana unless iongress other wise directs, I shall not oppose the landing of our telegraphic cable, which complies with, and assents to, the points above en umerated, bnt will feel it my duty to prevent the landing of any which do not conform to the fi'st and second points, as staled, and which will not stipu late to concede to this gov ernment the preceding in tbe transmission of its official message, and will not enter into satisfactory arrange ments as regards its charges. Among the raostpressing and important subjects', and to which, in my opinion, the attention of Congress should be directed, are those relating to 

FRAUDULENT XATCRALEUTTOX and expatriation. The United States, with great liberality, offers its citizenship to all who, in good faith, comply with the re quirements of the law. These require ments are as simple and upon as favorable terms to the emigrant as the high privilege to which he is admitted can or should (r mit. I do. not propose any additional re quirements to those which the law now de mands, but the very simplicity and want of necessary formality in our law have made fraudulent naturalization not infrequent, to the disrespect and injury of all citizens. whether native or naturalized. Cases of this kind are continually being brought to the notice of the Government by onr repre sentativea abroad, and also those of persons resident in other countries ; less frequently those. If they have remained in this coun try long enough to entitle them to become naturalized, they have generally not much over-passed that period, and have relumed to the country of their origin, where they reside, avoiding all duties to the United States by their absence and claiming to bo exempt from all duties to the country of their maternity, and of their residenc, by reason of their alleged naturalization it is dee to this government, itself, and to the great mass of naturalized citizens who en tirely, hotb in cane and iu fact, become citizens of the United States that the iiigh privilege of citizenship of the United States should Dot be who may now ol I tne esiaur o- - - i was presented. ... ... , or in dercgaiioii of the law, and of tlie good name oi every nonefT citizen, un many occasions it has been brought to the knowl edge of the government that certificates of naltiraliza'ioi are held, and protection or interference claimed by parties who admit tjiat not only they were not within the United States at tbe time of pretended nat iiralizition, but that thev have never rc- sided in ti-e United States. In other, the certificate and record of the court how on their face that the persons, claimii-g to l naturalized, had not resided the icquired time in the United Stato. In othersj it is admitted upon examination, thht the re quirements of the law have not been com plied with. In some cases even such cer tificates have been matters of purchase. Thoe are not isolated cases, arising at rare intervals, but of common occurrence, and which are reported from all quarters of tbe globe ; such occurrences cannot -and do not tail to reflect upon the government and iniure ail honest citizens. Such A fraud being discovered, however, there ls no practicable means within tiie control of the government by which the record of naturalization can be vacated, and should the certificate ba taken up, as it usually is, by tlie diplomatic anil consular representa tives of the government wher it may have been presented, there is nothing to prevent a person claiming to hare in-cn naturalized from obtaining a. new certificate from the court in place of that which has been taken from him. The evil has become so great and of such frequent occurrence, that I can not too strongly recommend that some tf fectual measures be adopted to provide a proper remedy for the vacating ol" aiiy rec ords fraudulently obtained, ar.d of punish ing guilty parties to the transaction. In this etnneclion 1 refer al-o to the question of expatriation, The United States was foremost in holding the right of ;expatria ting, and was principally instrumental in overthrowing the doctrine of peretual al legiance. Congress has declared the right of expatriation to l a national inherit right ol all people, but when many other nations have laws providing what formali ties shall be necessirv to work a charge of allegiance. The United Stales has enacted the provi-ions of law, and has, in no re spect, marked one, how and when expatn atiou may be accomplished by its citizens. instances are brought to the attention of the government, where citizens ol the United states, natur alized or native born, have formally be come citizens or subjects of fortigu po-ir.s, but who, nevertheless, in theabsenccof any provisions of legislation on tiie question, when involved in difficulties, rr when it seems to be to their interest to claim to lie citizens of the United States, demand the intervention of the United Stales Govern ment, which they have 

LOXO SIXCE ABAXDOXKP, and to which for years they have rendered no service, or held themselves in any way amenable. In other cases, naturalized citi zen, immediately after their naturalization, have returned to their native land, and have there become engaged in business, and in pursuits content with American citizenship, and evince no intent to return to the United States, until called upon to dis charge some duty to the country where they are residing, when at once they assert their citizenship, and call upon the representa tives of the government to aid them in their unjust pretension. It is but justice to bona fide citizens that no doubt should exist on such questions, and that Congre-H should determine, by the enactment of a law, how expatriation will be accomplished, and a change of citizenship be otabli-hed. I also invite your attention to the necessity of regulating by law the statutes of American women who may marry foreigners, and of denning more iuny mat oi children irn in a foreign country, of American parents, who may reside abroad, and also of some further provision regulating cr giving le gal effect to marriages of American citizen, contracted in foreign countries. The cor respondence submitted herewith, show a few of the constantly occurring questions on these points, presented to the considera tion of tbe government. There are a few subjects to engage the attention of Con gress, on which more delicate relations arc depending. In the month of Jnly Ix-t, the building erected lor the .Department ol state irai taken ossesion of and occupies, by that Department. I am hap py to ay that the archives and valuable papers of the government, in the custody of that Department, arc now safely deposited, and properly cared for. SaCKETAUY OF TltETEEAslT.Y's BLTOilf.

Tho rejiort al-o shows a complete history of the working of the Deiiartment for the la-t vear, ar.d Contains recommendation for reforms and for legislation, which 1 concur in, but cannot communicate on so freely as I would like to do, if space would permit; bat I will confine myself to a few suggestions, which I look upon as vital to the bet intensts of the whole people, com ing within the purview of the Treasury. I MEAN SPECIE REsUMITIOX. Too much stress cannot be laid upon this question, and I hope Gingress may be in duced, at the earliest day practicable, to insure the consummation of the act of the last Congress at its last session to bring about specie resumption on and after the first of January, 1S79, at farthest. It would be a grel blessing if this could ls consummated even at an earlier day. Noth ing seems to me more certain than that a full,-healihy and permanent reaction can not take place in lavor ot the industries and financial welfare of lhc country nntil we return to a measure of values recognized throughout the civilized world. While wo use a currency not equivalent to the stan dard the world recognizes, specie becomes a commodity like the products ot the soil the surplus seeking a market wherever there is a demand for it. Under our present svs- tem we should want none, or would we have any, were it not that custom dues miut be paid in coin, and because of the pledge to pay the interest of the public debt in coin, the yield of precious metals would flow out lor the purchase ol foreign production, and leave the United States hewers of wood and drawers of water, be cause of wiser legislation on the subject of finance by the nations with whom we have dealings. I am not prepared to say that I can suggest the best legislation to secure the end, but most heartily commended, it will be a source of great gratification to me to bo able to approve any measures of Con gress looking effectively towards securing resumption. 

CXLIMITED IXFLATIOX would probably bring about specie pay ments mote speedily than any legislation looking to tne redemption of legal tenders in coin, but it would be at tbe expense of honor. The legaltenders would have no value beyond settling the present liabilities, or, properly speaking, repudiating them. They would buy nothing after the debts were all settled. There are a few measures which seems to me important in this connectioo,and which I recommend to your consideration. A re peal of so much of the legal tender acts as makes the notes receivable lor debts con tracted after a date to be fixed in the act itself, so it is not later than the 1st oi Jan uary, 1S77. We should then have quota tion at real values, not fictitious ores. Gold would no longer be at a premium, but cur rency at a discount. A healthy reaction would ret in at once, and with a de gree to make currency to equal what it purports to be, the merchant, manufacturer, ar.d tradesmen of tverv calling, cculd do business on a FAlE ilAEGlX OF 

PKOJTT, on monev received, it having unvarying value. Laborers and all classes who work for stipulated pay or salary, would receive more for their income, Iws?aue extra profits. would be ro longer char ;. 1 by the capital ists, to compensate for the ri-k of a down ward fluctuation in the value of the cur rency. Second : That the Secretary cf the Trcas- UAJ M .UM.V.- - .-., - W- W ...

Ti.is would, in time, redeem the legal tender role to a volume that could be kent atSat vi:rout remanding redemption in largo sUri: sud denly. Third That additional power be given to tl: la: tailing the czpeuso, or both ; it is prefer able to do loth, ami I recommend that a reduction of extendit'ircs be mde when ever it can he done without iiupairinijgov rnment obligations or crippling tin y. ...iuAii.li uieri-oi one measure io increasing the reveni.e, and the only one, think, is the rp-toratian pf the IllTV OX TEA AX3 COFFEE. These duties would add probably eight een million dollars to the present amount received for imports, and would in no war increase the prices paid for those article's by the consumers. Thee articles are tho products of countries collecting revenue from exports, and as we are the large-tcon-numers, ne reduce the ditties, r.s tliev pro portionately increa-e them. With tfiis ad dition to the revenue, many duties now col lected, and which give but'an insignificant return, lrom the cost of collection.might be remitted, and to the direit advantages of consumers alone. I would mention those articles which enter into manufactures of all sort, all duty paid upon such articles go directly to the co-t of the article when manufactured, and miut he paid for by consumer. The duties now- only come troai the consumers alone, but acts as a protection tofortign manufacturers of the same completed article in our own and distant maikels. I will suggest or mention another sub ject, bearing upon the problem ot how to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to ac cumulate balances. It is to devi'-e some better method of veritving claims against the government, than at present exists through the Court of Claim, especially thu-e claims growing out of the late war. Nothing is more certain than that a Iar; pertentage of the amounts passed and paid are part or wholly fraudulent, or are far in excess of the leal losses sustained. The large amount of losses, proven on good tes timony, according to existing laws, by afkdavits of fictitious or uiiscttipulcus jer sons, to have bien sustained on small farms und plantations, are r.ot only far beyond the possible yield of these p'laces for" any one year, but as every one knows who has had exjierience in tilling the soil, and who has visited the scen.-s of the sjH)Iiation,are many irs.tat.ces worth more than the indi vidual claimants were ever worth, includ ing their personal and real estate. The report uf the Attorney General, which will be submitted to Congress at an early day. vriil contain a detailed history of the awards made, and of claims pending, of the class here referred to- 

TIIK llLTOaT OF THE SECRITAKY OF WAJi accompanying tins message, gives a detailed account ol the army operations for the vear just passed, the expenses for maintenance, etc., whh rtcuniniendatims for legislation, to which I respectfully inviie your atten tion. To some of these 1 invite "pecial at tention : First: The necessity of making thirty thousand dollars of the appropriation for the subsistence of the department available before the beginning of the next fiscal year. Without this provision, troops at points distant from the supply and production, mu-t either go without food, or the existing laws mu-t Le violated.

Should ar ever occur between the United Stales a id any mara time jmwer, torpedoes will be among, if not the most effective and cheapest auxiliar ies lor the defence of our harbors and also in aggre-sive operations that we can have. Hence, it is advisable to learn ! uj eijHrrt- ment, their best construction and applica- tion, as well as effect. Fifth: A permanent organization for the Signal Service Corps. This Service has now become a necessity of juace as well war, under tiie advancement made by the present able management. Sixth: A roueval of the appropriation for completing the official records of the war, etc. The condition of THE 

XAVY at this time is a subjict of satisfaction ; it is true, il does not contain any of the powerful, cruising irou-clads which make so much of the maralime strength of some other Na tions, bat neither our continental situation nor our foreign jiolicy requires that we should haw a large number of hi( of this character while this situation and the na ture of our ports Continue to make lho-e of o-.iur Naliuus little dangerous to us under any eircum-taiice. Our Navy does contain, howevrr, a considerable number of iron-dads ot the monitor cla-, which, though not properly cruiser, are jiowerful ar.d tflective for har bor difincc, and for ojiratioii near our own shore. Of these, all the single tur retled ot.-s, fifteen in i.umbtr, have been sub-tantially rebuilt, their rotten wuoden beams replaced with iron, their hulls strengthened, and their cigints ai.d ma chinery thoroughly repaired, so that they are now in ihe most tliicier.t condition, and readv for sea as soon as they can be man ned and j.ut in commission. The five double-turrettrd iron-clad, belonging to our navy, by far tha modt powerful ships for fighting purjioses, are also in hand, under going complite repairs, and could Le ready lor tea in jeriods varyig from four to six months. With these completed according to the present design, and our two iron tor Ido boats, row ready, our iron-clad llttt will be for thepiirpo-esof defense at home, equal tj any lorce that can bo readily brought against it. u: our wooden navy, al-o, cruisers of various sizes, to the num ber of aliout forty, including those now in the commission, are in the Atlantic, and could be reaily for duty as fast as men could be enlisted for those not already in the commission. Of these, cue-third are in effect new ships, and though some of the remainder nied considerable repairs on their boilers and machinery, they are all. or can readily be made effective. This constitutes a licet of more than fifty war ship, ot whicii fifteen are iion-clsds, now in hand on the Atlantic coast. Tlie navy has been brought to this condition by a ju dicious ami practical application of what could be spared from the current appropriations of the last few year, and from that made to meet the possible emergency of two years ago. It has been done quietly, without proclamation or display, and though it has necessarily straightened the department in its ordinary expenditures, and as far as the iron-clad are concerned, has added nothing to the cruising force of the navy, yet the result is not the leas satisfactory, because it is to Le fenni in a great increase of real rather than apparent force.

EETVKT. The report of the Postniarter-Gcneral. a full historv- artment for the the deficiency to be supplied from the gin ral Treasury is increased over the amount of the preceding year. In a country s va-i m area as the United States, "with large portions sparsely settfevl, it must l exjiectetl that this important service will be more or less a burden upon the Treasury for muny years to come ; bnt there is no branch of the public service which inter ests the whole people more than thit of cheap and rapid transmission of the mails. Tiie commercial advantages to be gained by a direct line of American steamers to the South American States, will far out weigh the expense of service. Bv Act of Congress, approved March 3d, lbTS, almat all matter, whether properly mail matter or n, may le sent any distance through the mail in packages not exceeding four pound in weight, for the sum of sixteen ivnts jier pound. So far as the transmis sion ol" real matter goes, this would svem entirely proper; but I suggest that the law le so amended as to exclude from the mail merekar.di-e of all descriptions, and limit this transportation to all articles cnunur ated, and which may be classed as mail matter proper. THE BLACK IHLLS. The discovery of gold in the Black Hill. portion of the Sioux reservation, has had the effect to induce a large emigration of miners to that point. Thus far the effort t. protect the treaty-rights of the Indian. of that section has been successful, but the ntxt year will certainly witness a large in-crea-s; of such emigration. The negotiation for the relinquishment of the gold field-, having failed, it will lie necesary for Con gress to adopt some measures to relieve the embarrassment growing out of thecaust namtd.

The Secretary of the Inte rior has taken measures to obtain a full n port tf the condition of that Territory, ai d wiil make it the subject of a special report at an early day. It may then be necessaiy to make some further recommendations ia regard tolegislation for the government of that Territory. TUB TATEXT OFFICE.

More than one-half of the decrease was in lands di-j osed ol under the Homestead and Tim ber Culture I-aws.

TENSION Kit. Tiie number of pensioners still contimirx to decrease, the highest number having been reached during tbe year ending June SOth, 1S73. During the " Iat vear 11,007 were added tothe roll, and 11VJ77 were dropjicd therefrom, howii-g a net decrease of 1,4:10. But while thenumberof ieiisioii crs has decreased, the anmiual amount dm: onthepension rolls ha increased $11,7.13.13. This is caused by the greatly incre.ied av erage rate of pensions, which, by the liberal legislation of Congress, increased from fJO.Xj, in lS7- to SI03.U1, in 1S75, to eaih invalid pensiur.er, an increase, iu the av cerag', of fifteen per cent, in the three year.
