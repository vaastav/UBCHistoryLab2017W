security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the Intelligence and patriotism of all good cit izens of every part of the country, taowever muen they may be divided In opinlonson other political subjects, to unite In compelling obe dience to t-xlstinglAwa aimed at the protection of the right ot feutlrag. I respectmlly urge npon Congress to supply any defects In these laws which experience has shown and which It Is wlr hin its power to remedy. 1 again In voke the co-operation of the executive and legislative authorities ot t ie Htatts in this great purpose. 1 am fully convinced that if the public mind can be net at real on tnis par amount quest lou of popular rights, uo serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the couutry, or retard the gen eral dtrTusUn of prosperity. In a former menage I invited the attention of Congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service or the Government, and expressed the Intention of transmitting to Congress a early as practicable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the civil ser vice commission In view or the fcts that, during a consider able period, the Government ot Great Britain has been dealing with administrative prob lems and abases, in various particulars an alogous to those presented in this country, and that tn recent years the measures adopted were understood to have b-en effective and in every respect highly satisfactory, I thought It desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chair man of the civil service commission to make a thorough Investigation lor this purpose. The result has been an elaborate and compre hensive report. The report sets forth the history of the par tisan pol Is nyftem In Great Britain, and ot the rise and fall of the parliamentary pattoupge, and of official lnter'erence with the freedom of elections. It shows that alter long trials of various kinds of examinations, those which are competitive and open on tqualteribs to all, and which are cairied on uuuer the super intendence of a single commission, have, with great advantage, been established as con ditions or admission to almost every official place in the ubordnate administration of that country and of Brltih India. The com pletion of the report., owing to the extent of the labor involved In Its preparation, and the omission of congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the expenses of the commission, has been postponed until the present time. It Is herewitii transmitted to Con gresH. While the reform measures of another Gov ernment are of no authority for us they are entitled to in tluencw, to the extent to which their intilnsic wisdom, and their adaptation to our Institution and social lie may com mend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed con cerning the defects aud abuses in our civil ad ministration remain unchned, except in so far as an enlarged ex perlet ce has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of the people themselves to co-operate for their re moval. The grave evils and perils of a parti san spoils system of app iutmeut to office and of othce tenure, are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in the report tt departments, in the debates and proceedings of Congress, lu the messages of executives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out aud the need of their reform has been admitted. Tocommaud the necessary support, every measure of reform must oe based on common right and Justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are Inevitable and essential In a free täte. When the people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected, and of the advisers who, in accordance with our political institutions, should be consulted, in the poli cy which It is their duty to carry Into effect. Is indispensable. It Is eminently proper that thfy should explain it before the people, as well as illustrate its spirit In the performance of their official duties. Vry different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordi nate places in the civil service. Their respon sibility Is to their superiors In official position, it is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upvu whom that authority is de volved, and their best public service consists In the discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the tame, whatever pnrty is in power and what ever policy prevails. As a consequence, it fol lows that their tenure or office should not de pend on the prevalence of any podcy or the supremacy of any party, but should be deter mined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully, quite Irrespective of partisan interests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure Should also prevail In the appointment, d sclpllueand removal of these subordinates. The authority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but la a trust to ue exercised in the public Interest, under all the sauctioni which attend the ob ligation to apply the public funds only for public purposes. Kvery citizen has an equal right to the hon r and profit or entering the public service ol his couutry. The only Just ground of discrim ination U the measure of character and capac ity he h - s to make that service most useful to the people. Except in cases where, upon Just and recognized principles, as upon the theory of pensions, offices aud promotions are be stowed as rewards for past fervices, their be stowal upon any theory which dbregard per sonal merit is an act ot injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject tu which the appointing power is held. In the light of these principles It becomes of great Importance to provide Just and adequate means, especially for every department, and large administrative office, where personal discrimination on the part of its head is not prectlcabie for ascertaining those qualifica tions to which appointment and removals should have reference. To f il to provide such means Is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facta upon which the most righteous claim to office depends, but.ot neces sity, to discourage all worthy aspirant?, by handing over appointments and re movals to mere luffuence atd favorit ism. If It Is the right of the worthiest claimant to gaiu the appointment, and the Interest of the people to bestow it upon him.lt would seem cte-r that a wise and just method of ascertaining personal fitness for office muit be an Important and perma nent function of every Just and wise govern ment. It has long since become Impossible, in the great offices, lor those having the duty of nomination and appointment, to personal lv examine Into the individual qualifications of more than a small proportion of those seek ing office; and, with the enlargment of the civil service, that proportion must continue to bconiB Icsn In the earlier years of the Government, the subordinate officf s were so few in number that it was quite easy for those making appoint ments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates. Party managers and methods had not then become powerfal agencies of coercion, hostile to the free and Just exerci.se of the appointing power. A large and responsible part f the duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and efficiency rests upon the president, and it is my purpose to do what Is within my power, to advance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical chage of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfac tory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise ot authority, it is In the power of the executive to do ranch to promote such a reform. But it can not b too clearly under stood that nothing adequate can be accom plished without co operation on the part of Congress, and considerate and intelligent sap port among the people Reforms which chal lenge the generally accepted theories of par ties, and demand changes In the methods of department, are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in sound principles, and in an experience whlcndemon strates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversaries. Kvery worthy officer de sires to make his official action a gain and an honor to his country, bat the people them selves, far more than their officers in public station, are interested In a pure, economical, and vigorous administration. By laws enacted in 153 and 14, and now In substance incorporated in the revised statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades In the great depart ments was condemned, and examinations, as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of examiners, were provided for and made conditions of admission to the public service. These Statutes are a decision by Con gress that examinations of some sort, as to at tainments and capacity, are essential to the well being of the public service. The im portant questions since the enactment ol these laws have been as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favor and partisan Influence, or common right and merit, were to control the access to the exam inations. In practice, tiiese examinations have not always been open to worthy persons generally, who might wish to be examined. Official favoritism and partisan Influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examin ing boards, subjecting even the examiners to pressnre from the mends of the candidates very difficult to rtsi.st. As a consequence, the standard of admission fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was also al most Inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion. In consistency, and Inadequate tests of capacity Highly detrimental to the public Interests. A further and more radical change was obvi ously required. In the annual message of December, 1870, my predecessor declared that "there is no duty which so much embarrasses the executive and heads of departments as that of appoint ments; nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on senators and re presentatives as that of finding places for con stituents. 'Ilie present system does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men for the public p'aces. The elevation and purifi cation of the civil service of the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States," Congress accord ingly passed the act, approved March 3, 1871. "to regulate the civil ervlce of the United States and promote the efficiency thereof," giving the necessary authority to the execu tive to inaugurate a civil service reform. Acting under this statute, which was inter preted as intended to secure a system of Just and effectual examiuations under uniform supervision, a number of eminently compe tent persons were selected for the purpose, who entered with zeal upon the discharge of ffcelr duties, prepared, with an intelligent ap- preclatlon of the requirements of the service, the regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, in their capac ity as a Doaru, nave ueen Known as the "Civil Service Commission." Congress for two years appropnaieu me money neeaea ior tne com pensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the commission. It appears from the report of the commis sion, submitted to tne president in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an ap propriation or aoout i,uuu would be required to meet the annual expenses, Including salaries, involved in discharging the duties of the commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the fol lowing favorable comment upon the labors of the commission : "if sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the rules can, arter the ex perience gained, be so Improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the Dubllo service and relieve the executive, members of Congress and the heads of departments, from Influences prejudicial to good administration. me ruies, as tney n-ve imnerto Deen en forced, hive resulted beneflcUlly, as is shown by the opinions of the mem bers of tue cabinet and their sub ordinates lu the departments, and in that opinion I cone u." Aud in the annual meg- sage of Decemner of the same year, similar views are expressed, and an appropriation for continuing the work of the commission again advised. The appropriation was not made, and, as a cousequence, the active work of the commis sion was suspeuk-(i. leaving the commission Itself still in existence. Without the means. therefore, of causing qualifications to be tested in any systematic manner, or of securing for the public service the advantages ot competition upon any extensive plan, I recommended lu my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an appropriation tor the resump tion of the work of the commission. In the meantime, however, competitive ex atnlninallons uuder rnauy embarrassments have been conducted withiu limited spheres in the executive departments in Washington, and in a number of the Custom Houses and post offices of the principal cities or the country, wltn a view to further test their ef fects, and, la every Instance, they have been fouud to be as salutary as tney are staUd to have been under the administration of ray predecessor. I think the economy, purity and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic intro duction, wherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the Government, to gether with ample provision for their general supervision, in oruer to secure consistency and uniform Justice. Reports from the secret iry of the Interior, from the postmaster-general, from the pot raMer In the city of New York, where such examinations have been sometime on trll, and also from the collector of the port, the naval officer, and the surveyor In that city, aud from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has, in various ways, contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the gen eral application ol similar rules cau not fall to be of decided benefit to the service. The reports of the Government officers, in the city or New York especially, bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respective ottices,show lng that "these examinations, and the excel lent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them, have had a marked In cidental effect upon the persons previously In the service, and particularly upou thos aspir ing to promotion. There has been, on the part or thete latter, an Increased Interest in the work, and a desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raise 1. The examinations have been attended by many cltlzeus who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests and the meth od of deter mining the results, and those vis itors have, without exception, approved the methods employed, and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion." Upon such considerations. I deem It my duty to renew the recommendation contained in my annual message of Decern ler, 177, re questing Congress to make the necessary ap propriation for the resumption or the work of the civil service commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate coin pensatlon to persons in the public service who may perform extra labor upon or under the commission, as the executive may direct. I am convinced that It a Just aud adequate test of merit is enforced for admission to the public service and in making promotions, such abuses as removals without good cause and partisan and official Interference with the proper exercise of the apiKjlntlng power, will in Urge m as a re disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap pointments, and the constant peril of removal without cause, very naturally lead 10 an ab sorbing and mischievous political activity, on the pat t of those thus appointed, which not only Interferes with the due discharge of offi cial dutv. but Is Incompatible with the free dom o'electlous. Not without warrant. In the views of several of my predecessors in the presidential office, and directly within the law ol 1871. already cited, I endeavored, by regulation, made on the 22d day of Juae. 1577, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be necessary, to define with precision the proper limit of political action ou the part of Federal officers. But while their right to hold and freely express their opinions cau not be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the lime needed for the proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinion. Reasons of Jostice and public policy, quite analagous to those whicn lorbld the use of official power for the oppression of the pri vate citizen, impose upon the Gevernment the duty of protecting its officers and ageuts from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies, for party purpotts, upon the salaries of officers is highly demoralizing to the public sei vice and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should re as free as any other citizen to give his own money In aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a lair compensation for the time and labor of the officer, It is gross injus tice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax, the excess is an Indirect robbery of the public fnnds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present Statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a gre t aud enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful In its service. Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful. With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of the local laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provin cial authorities, deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to American fisher men. The United Btates minister in London has been Instructed to present a demand for 9 .05,305.02, In view or the damages received by American citizens at Fortune Bay of the 6th day of January. 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the British Gov ernment.and an early reply Is anticip ated. Upon the completion of the necessary pre liminary examinations, the subject of our par ticipation In the provincial fisheries, as regu lated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention or the British Government with a view to an early and iernianent settlement of the whole question, which was only tempora rily adjusted by tne treaty of Washington. Efforts have been made to obtain the re moval or restrictions round Injurious to the exportation of cat t.e to the United Kingdom. ttome correspondence has also occurred wltn regaid to the rescue and saving of life and firoperty on the lakes, which has resulted in mportant modifications of the previous regu lations of tne Dominion Government on the subject, in the interest of humanity and com merce. In accordance with the Joint resolution ol the last session of Congress, commlssoners were appointed to represent the United 8 tales at the two International exhibitions in Aus tralia, one of which is now in progress at Sydney, and the other to be held next year at Melbourne. A desire has been expressed by our merchants and manufacturers Interested in the important and growing trade with Aus tralia, that an Increased provision should be made by Congress for tue representation of our Industries at the Melbourne exhibition of next year, and the subject is respectfully sub mitted to your favorable consideration. The assent ot the Government has been given to the landing, on the coast or Massa chusetts, ot a new aud Independent trans atlantic cable between France, by the way of the French island or Ht. Pierre, and this coun try, sublec, to auv future legislation of Con gress on :he subject. The conditions Imposed, before allowing this connection with our shores to be established, are such as to secure its competition with any existing or luture lines of marine cable, and preclude amalga mation therewith, to provide for entire equal ity of rights to nur Government and people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the disad vantage of any future cable communication between Frauce and the United Htates which may be projected and accomplished by onr citizens. An important reduction oi tne pres- reit to be too burdensome to the interests of oar commerce, mast necessarily flow from the establishment ol this competing line. The attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety or some general regulation dv son gress of tne whole subject or transmarine ca bles by ruv predecessor in his message or De cember 7, 1875, and I respectfully submit to your consideration the importance or con gressional action in this matter. The qaestlons of grave importance with Spain, growing out of the Incidents f the Cu ban insurrection have been, for the most part, happily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the commis sion now sitting in Washington, tor tne de cision of private cases in this connection, will soon be able to bring it labors to a conclusion. The long standlns Question of East Florida claims has lately been renewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Congressional action for Its fiual disposition. A treaty with the Netherlands, with respect to consular rights and privileges, similar to those wltn other powers, has been signed and ratified, and the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st or July last. Negotiations for ex tradition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark are now in progress. tsome questions with (Switzerland, In regard to pauper and convict emigrants, have arisen, but it is not doubted thtt they will be ar ranged upon a just and satisfactory oasis. A question has also occurred with respect to an asserted claim oy 8 wis J municipal authori ties to exercise tutelage over persons and prop erty ot Hwis- citizens naturalized in this coun try. It Is possible this may requite adjust ment by treaty. With the German Empire frequent ques tions arise in connection with the subjects of naturalization and expatriation; but the Im perial Government has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them. In consequence of the omission of Congress to provide for a diplomatic representative at Athens, the legation to Greece has been with drawn. There Is now no channel of diplomat ic communication between the two countries, and the expediency of providing for one, in some form, Is submitted to Congress. Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portu gal. Turkey and Belgium continue amicable, and marked by no incidentof especial import ance. A change of the personal head ot the Gov ernment of Egypt has taken place. No change, however, has occurred in the relations be tween Egypt and the United States. The ac tion of the Egyptian Government in present ing to the city of Sew York one of the ancient obelisks, which possess such historic Interest, is highly appreciated as a generous mark ot international regard. If prosperity should at tend the enterprise of Its transportation across the Atlantlo, its erection in a conspicuous po sition In the chief commercial city of the na tion will soon be accomplished. The treaty recently made between Japan and the United Htates In regard to the revision or former commercial treaties. It is now be lieved will be followed by similar action cu the part of other treaty powers. The attention of Congress Is again invited to the subject of the Indemnity funds received some years since from Japan and China, which with their accumulated interest, now amount to consid erable sums. If any part of these funds is justly due to American citizens they should receive It promptly ; and whatever may have been received by this couutry in excess of strictly Just demands, should lu some form be returned to the nations to whom it equitably belongs. The Government or China has signified its willing1 to consider the question of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with a dispassionate fairness, an1 to co-operate in such measures as may tend to prevent lujurlous consequences tr the United States. The negotiation are still proceeding, and will be prtssed with diligence. A question having arisen between China andJupnn about the Lew ('hew islands, the United Htates Guvernment has taken meas ures to Inform those powers of its read loess to extend Its good offices for the maintenance of peace, if they shall mutually deem It desirable and find it practicable to avail themselves of the proffer. It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two nations on each side of the Hlo Grande, uuder the instructions of their resp ctlve Govern ments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, aud. In ttie localities w)u re former ly most destructive, have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result. I entertain a confident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so as sured as to justify a modification of the pres entor ersto our military commanders as to cro-sig the border, without encouraging such disturbances as wou'd eudauger the peace of trie two countries. The thin instalment of the award agslust Mexico under the c'aims com mission of July 4. IstiS. was duly paid, and has been put lu course of distribution In pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the same. This sat- lsiactory situation oetweeu tne two count rie leads me to anticipate an expansion or our trade with Meilcoand an Increased contrihti tlon of capital and Industry by our people to ttie develonment or the Kreut resources or that country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom or Congress the provision ol suitable leglsia tlou looking to this result. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia Is again fully restored by the arrival of a minis ter from that couutry to the United States. This is especially fortunate, in view or the fact that the question of an lnter-oceanio canal has recently assumed a new and important aspect. and is now under discussion with the Central merlcau couutrles through whose territory the canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightened states manship ou their part will see that the early prosecution or such a work will largely Inure to the benefit, not on ly of their own citizens and those of the United States, but of the com- tnetce of the civilized world. It Is not doubt ed that, should the work tx undertaken under the protective auspices of the united tat, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of way, aud its security, by the Central Americau governments, the capital for Its completion would be readily furnished f.om this country and Europe, which might, fall lng such guarantees, prove inaccessible. AUplomatlc relations with Chill have also been stretighened by the reception of a min ister from that couutry. The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chill still continue. The United Htates have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter, further than to convey to all the Governments coucerned, the assurance that the friendly offices of the Government of the United States for the restoration of peace upon an honorable basis will be extended. In case the belliger ents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cordial relations continue wltn urazu and the Argentine Republic, and trade with those countries is improving. A provision for regu lar aud more frequent mall communication, in our own ships, between the ports of this country and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve the attention of Con gress, as an essential precursor of an enlarge ment or our commerce wita mem, ana an ex tension ot our carrying trade. I A recent revolution In Venezuela has been followed by the establishment ol a provisional Government. This Government has not yet been formally recognized, and it is deemed de sirable to awatt the proposed action of the people, which is expected to give it the sane tlon of constitutional forms. A naval vessel, has been sent to the Samoan Islands, to make surveva and take nossesslon of the privileges ceded to the United Htates by Samoa, in tne naruor or fa go rago. a coal ing station Is to be established thete, which will be convenient and useful to United Htates vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic relations with Roumanla aa Hervla, now become inde pendent sovereignties, is at present under consideration, and Is the subject of diplomatic correspondence. There is a graurying increase oi iraae witn nearly all European aud American countries. and it Is beileved that with Judicious action lu regard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced, and that A merlcan pro ducts aud manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports of diplo matic and consular officers upon inissuoject, nnder the system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining much valuable information. which has been aud will continue to be laid before Congress aud the public rrom time to time. The third article or the treaty with Russia, of March 3U, 1W7, by which Alaska was ceded to the united states, provides mat tne in nam tants of the ceded territory, with the excep tion of the uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of ail the rights of citizens of the United Htates, and shall be maintained and protected In the free enjoy ment Of tneir liberty, property, aud religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and regulations as the United Htates may from time to time adopt In regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country. Both the obligations or this treaty and the necessities of the people reqnlre that some organized form or government over the Ter ritory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to oe no law for the arrest or persons charged with common-law offenses, Buch as assault, robbery and murder, and no magistrate authorized to issue or execute pro cess In such cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses or this character, not only among the original Inhabitants, but among citizens of the United Htates and other countries, who hsve engaged In mining, fish ing and other business operations within the Territory. A bill authorizing the appointment of Justices of the peace and constables, and the arrest and detention of persons charged with criminal offenses, aud providing for an appeal to United states courts for the district of Ore gon, in suitable cases, will, at a proper time, be submitted to Congress. The attention ot Congress is called to the an nual report of the secretary of the treasury on the condition or the public fluances. Tlie ordinary revenues from II sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, lS7i, were t-73,-K27,lSl.li: the ordinary expenditure for the same period were f2,ki,"W7ss..5;: leaving a sur plus revenue for the year of 3.X79.H 1. The receipts for the present fiscal year, end ing June :m, 1880, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter commencing July 1, 1879, 3,ü3.öl; esti mated receipts for the remaiulng three-quarters of the year, AMötf,KJJ.3U; total receipts for the carvent fiscal year, actual and esti mated, f2S8.000,0U0. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual ex penditures, Wl.683,38 J.10; and for the remain ing three quarters of the year thaexpenditures are estimated at H721ö,öHJ0-maklng the total expenditures 128i,OUD,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the year ending June 30, 1880, or 124,000,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year ending June 30. 1881, estimated according to existing laws, will be 

K8S.O0O.0.X); and the estimated ordinary ex penditures for the same period will be J278,-097;&i.3U-leavlng a surplus of f9,9U2,6:$5.l lor that year. The large amount expended for arrears ot penllons during the last and the present fiscal year, amounting to 121,717,249 10, has prevented the application or the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for the current year; but these arrears having been substantially paid. It is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained without any ohange ot existing law. xne secretary oi war reports that the war department estimates for the fiscal year end ing june au, i90i, are iw,3u,ra.iKj tne same being for a less sum of money that any annual estimate rendered to Congress from that de partment during a period or at least 12 years, lie concurs with the general of the army In recommending sucu legislation as will author ize the enlistment of the full number of 2-j,uuu men ror the line or tne army, exclusive or the 8.4Ö3 men required ror detacoed duty, and therefore not available for service In the field. He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for the disposition of a large numoer ox ananuonea military posts and reservations, which, though very valuable in themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civiliza tion and settlement. Ue unites with the quartermaster general in recommending that an appropriation be made for the construction of a cheap and per fectly fire proof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims, and other valuable records now In the quartermaster general's office, and exposed to great risk to total destruction by fire. He also recommends, in conformity with the views of the Jndge-advocate general, some declaratory legislation lu reference f the military statute of limitations as applied to the crime of desertion. In these several recommenlations I concur. The secretary of war further reports, that the wor k for the improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi liver, under contract with Mr. James B. Lads, made in pursuance of an act of Cougress.has been prosecuted during the past year, with a greater measure of success In the attainment of results than during any Previous year. The channel through the South ass, which, at the beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only seven and one halt feet of water, had, ou tu 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth ot 26 feet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of 30 feet. Payments have been made In accordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting In the aggregate to ,250,uuo; and further payments will become due, as pro vided by the statute, in the event of success In maintaining the channel now secured. The reports of the general of the army and of his subordinates, present a full and detailed account or the military operations for the suppression of hostilities among the In dians or the Ute and Apache tribes, and praise Is Justly awarded to the officers aud troops en gaged, for promptness, skill and courage dis played. The past year has been one of almost un broken peace and quiet on the Mexican fron tier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts or this Government, aud of Mexico, to maintain order in that region will prove per manently successful. This department was enabled during the past year to find temporary thongh crowded accommodations, aud a safe depository for a portion or its records, in the completed east wing of the building, designed for the state, war and navy departments. The construction of the north wing of the building, a part of the structure intended for the use of the war departmeut, is being carried forward with all posslb'A dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal appropriations as will secure Its speedy completion. me report or tne secretary or the navy shows continued improvement in that branch or the service during the last fiscal year. Ex tensive repairs have been made upon vesse's. and two new ships have been completed ana made rea -y tor sea. The total expenditures or the year ended Juue 30, 1879, including specific appropriations not estimated tor by the department, were 1 13,&riö,7 UM iy. The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amount or these spe cific appropriations, were I11,S13,317 79; but this is subject to a reduction ot '283,720.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants but not paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was H,38164-U7. There was, therefore, a balance of fl,479,u5i7 remaining unexpended, and to the credit of the depart ment on June 30,1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, IKSl, are SI 4,88 4, 147 Wi, which exceeds the appropriations lor the present fiscal year 1361,807:. The reason for this Increase is explained In the secretary's r p rt. The appropriations available for tue present fiscal year are 114,502,2.0.07, which will, in the opinion of the secretary, answer all the ordlnaty uemands of the service. The amount drawn nom the treasury from July 1 to No vember 1, 187, was 15,770,404.12, of which tlJJ95,-4K'.v-i has beeu refunded, leaving as the ex Pi.diture for that period S 4 74,903.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of the year ao no exceed the proportion for these four mouths, there will remain unexpended at the end of the year, f 477,359 30 of the current appropriations. The report of the secretary shows the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers or the pay corps ot the navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent or a single dollar. I unite with him in recommending the remov al of the observatory to a more healthful loca tion. Ttpt institution reflects credit nnon the nation, and has obtained the approbation of scientific men in all parts of the world. Its re moval from its present location would not only be conducive to the health of Its officers and professors, but would ereatlv increase its use fulness. The appropriation for Judicial expenses which hits heretofore been made for the de partment of Justice, in gross,was subdivided at i he la-t session of Congress, and no appropria tion whatever was tnade for the payment of the fees or marshals and their deputies, either In the service or nrocess or for the discharge of other duties; and since June 30 these officers nave continued the performance or their duties without compensation from the Government, taking upon themselves the necessary inci dental outlays, as well as rendering their own services, lu only a few unavoidable Instances has the proper execution of the process of the United States failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriation. This course of official conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the attorney general, who Informed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation npon the prospect of future legislation by Congress. I therefore especially recommend that Immediate appro priation be made by congress ror this purpose. The act making the principal appropriation for the department ot justice at previous ses sions has uniformly contained the following clause: "And for defraying the expenses' which may be incurred In the enforcement of the act approved February 28. 1870. entitled 'an act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled 'An act to enforoe the right of citi zens of the United States to vote in the teveral States of the United States, and for other pur poses,' or any acts amendatory thereof or sup plementary thereto.' " No appropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no general election for members or Congress occurred, the omission was a matter or little practical lm pittance. Such election will, however, take plactrdurlng the ensuing year, and the appropriation made ior tne pay or marsnais ana aeputi s snouiu ne sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such elections. ,; The business of the supreme court is, at pres ent, largely in arrears. It can not be expected that more causes can be decided than are nor. disposed or in its annual session, or that by any assiauuytue aisiinguifhea magistrates wno compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits, also, the business has increased to suoh an extent, that the delay of Justice will call the attent'on of Congress to an approprl ate remedy. It is beileved that all is done In each circuit which cau fairly be expected from its Judicial force. The evils arising from delay, are leas heavily felt by the United States, than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by the courts when It Is seen that they In voive the ciscusslou of questions of a public character. The remedy suggested by the attorney gen eral, is the appolutment of additional circuit Judges, and the creation of an intermediate court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve the sup erne court ot a part of its Jurisdiction, while a larger force Is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to the considera tion or Congress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve. If 10 additional circuit Judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate ol salaries, of not more than 100,000 a year, which would cer tainly be small in comparison with the objects to be attained. The report of the postmaster general bears testimony to the general revival of business throughout the country. The receipts for the postoffice department, for the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1879, were $30,04 1,982.86, being i7b4,4tto.tl more than the revenues of the pre ceding year. The amount realized rrom the sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards, was 764,455.91 more than in the preceding year, and 12,387,559.23 more than lu 1877. The expenditures of the department were 133,4 19,899. &, of which the sum of J76, 461. I was paid on liabilities incurred in pre ceding years. The expenditures during the year were fWl, 2Ü9.77 less than in the preceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the oiteratlou of the law passed June 17, 1878, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commission on the value of stamps sold, to a commission on stamps cancelled. The amount drawn from the treasury on appropriations In addition to the revenues of the department was 13,031,454 90 being 2,278. 197.88 less than in the preceding year. The expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are estimated at 9,920,900, and the re ceipts from all sources at 132,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for, out of tne treasury, of 17,710,900. The relations or the department with railroad companies have been harmonized, noth withstanding the general reduction by Congress of their compensation, by the appropriation for special facilities, and the railway postoffice lines have been greatly extended, especially in the Southern States. The Interests of the railway mall ser ice and of the public would be greatly promoted, and the expenditures could be more rendlly con trolled by the classification of the employes or the railway mail service as recommended by the postmaster general, the appropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit Is already fixed by law, to be made in gross. The postmaster general recommends . an amendment of the law regulating the increase or compensation for Increased service and in creased speed on star routes, so as to enable hlr to advertise for proposals for such in er -sed service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enactment of a general law authorizing contracts with American built steamers, carrying the American flag, for transporting the mall between ports ol the United states and ports of the West Indies and South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulated by annual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid for the domes tic star service. The arrangement made by the postmaster general and the secretary of the treasury for the collection of duty upon books received in the mail from foreign countries has proved so satisfactory In its practical operation that the recommendation is now made, that Congress shall extend the provisions or the act or Marth 3, 1879, under which this arrangement was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable arti cles received In the malls from foreign coun tries. The reports or the secretary or the interior and of the commissioner of Indian affairs, set ting forth the present state on our relations wltn the Indian tribes of our territory, the measures taken to advanoe their civilization and prosperity, and the jrogrees already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinal y interest. The general conduct of our India u population h&s been so satisfactory that the occurrence of two disturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of property, is ail the more to be lamented. The history of the outbreak on the White River Ute reservation in Western Colorado has become so familiar by elaborate reports In the public press that Its remarkable Incidents need not be Mated here in detail. It Is ex pected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indians and the border settlements lu Western Colo rado. Tae other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero agency, in New Mexico, where Vic toria, the head of a small band of marauders. arter oommlttlng many atrocities, being vig orously chased by a military force, made bis way across the Mexican border, and is now on foreign soil. While these occurrences. In which a com paratively small number of Indians were en gaged, are most deplorable, a vat majority of our Indian population have fully justified the expectations of those who believe that by humane and peaceful Influences the Indian can be led to abandon the habits of savage life and to develop a capacity for useful ana civi lized occupations. What they have already accomplished in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable buccess J which has attended tne experiment or em ploying as freighters a class of Indians hit her to counted among the wildest aud most in tractable, and the general and urgeut desire expressed by them for the education of their children, may be taken as sufficient proof that they will be found ca- f table of accomplishing much more r they continue to be wisely and fairly guided. The "Indian policy" sketched in the report of the secretary of the interior, the object of which is to make liberal provision for the edu cation of Indian youth, to settle the In dians upon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their farms, inalienable for a certain number or years, and when their wants are thus provided for, to dispose by sale of the lands on their reservations not occupied and used by them, a tund to be formed out of the proceeds for the benefit or the Indians, whl!h will gradually relieve the Government or the expenses now provided for by annual appropriations, must commeud itself as Just and beneficial to the Indians, and as also cal culate d to remove those obstructions which the exi-tence of large reservations presents to the s t lement and development ot the coun try. 1 therefore earnestly reoommend the enactment of a law enabling the Government to give Indians a title in fee, inalienable for 2i years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment. I also repeat the recommendation made In my first annual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof ot having, by their own labor, supported their families for a number of years, and who are willing to detach them selves from their tribal relatlons.to the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them pat ents containing the same provision of ina lienability for a certain period. The experiment or sending a number of In dian children, of both sexes, to the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Vir ginia, to receive an elementary - English edu cation and practical instruction in farming and other useful Industries, has led to re sults so promising, that it was thought expe dient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, lu Pennsylvania, to the interior de partment for the establishment of an Indian school on a larger scale. This school has now 158 pupils, selected from various tribes, and is in lull operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of a number ot Indian boys and girls belonging to tilbes on the Pa cific slope, in a similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These Institutions will commend themselve to the liberality of Con gress and to the philanthropic munificence of the American people. Liast spring Information was received of the organization of an extensive movement In the Western folates, the object or which was th occupation by unauthorized persons of cer tain lands In the Indian Territory ceded by the Cherokees to the Government lor the pur pose of sett lement by other Indian tribes. On the 29th of April 1 issued a proclamation warning all persons against participation in such an attempt, and. by the co-operation of a military force, the invasion was promptly checked. It Is my purpose to ptotect the rights of the Indian inhabitants of that Terri tory to the full extent of the executive power. But it would be unwise to Ignore the fact that a territory so large and so fertile, with a popu lation so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such at tempts as happened this year, when the surrounding B ates are more deusely settled, and the westward move ment of our population looks still more eager ly for fresh lands to occupy. Under uch clr cum stances the difficulty of maintaining the Indian Territory in Its present state will f reatly Increase, and the Indian tribes luhab ting it would do well to prepare for suoh a contingency. I, therefore, fully approve of the advice given to them by the secretary of the interior on a recent occasion, to divide among themselves In severalty as large a quatitityof their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual tiue in iee, in6ieaa or their oresent tribal ownership In common. and to consider In what manner the balance ol their lands may be disposed of by the Gov ernment for their benefit. By adopting such a polloy they would more certainly secure tor themselvo the value ot their possessions, and at the same time promote their p roerers in civlllzatlo i and prosperity, than by endeavor ing to perr etuate the present state or things in the Territory, The Question whether a change in tue con trol of the Indian service should be made was In the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a Joint committee of both Houses lor inquiry and report, in my last annual message i ex pressed the hope that me decision or mat ?iuestion, then in prospect, "would arrest urther agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a ui&turoing enect upon the servioe as well as the Indians themselves." Hince then, the committee having reported, the question has been decided In the negative by a vote In the House or Representatives For the reasons here stated, and in view of the tact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much-needed legislation, to weaken the dis cipline of the service ana to unsettle salutary measures now in progress ior tue government and Improvement ot the Indians, I respect mlly recommend that the aecision arrived at bv congress at its last sessiou be permitted to stand. The efforts made by the department oi the Interior to arrest the depredations on the timber lands or the United States have been continued, and have met with considerable success. A large number of cases of trespass have been prosecuted in ine couns oi me United States; others have been settled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for the value of the timber taken by them. Tne pi oceeds of these piosecutions and settlements turned into the treasury, far exceed in amount the sums appropriated by Congress for this purpose. A more important result, however, consists In the fact that the destruction or our public forests by depreda tlon, a though such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced In extent, and It is probable that )I the present policy Is vigorously pur sued and sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress, such trespasses, at least those on a large scale, can be entirely sup- Eressed, except in the territories where tim er for the dally requirements of the popula tion can not, under the present state or the law, be otherwise obtaiued. I therefore earn estly Invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made by the secretary of the interior, that a law be enacted enabling the Government to sell Umber from the public lands without conveying tbe fee, where such lands are principally valuable lor the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to conform to domestic wants and business re quirements, while at the same time guarding agaiust a sweeping destruction of the forests. The enactment of such a law appears to be come a more pressing necessity every day. My recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the department or agriculture. Agriculture Is the leading Interest and the permanent In dustry or our people. It is to the abundance or agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely in creased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly indebted for cur present prosperity as a people. We must look for its continued maintenance to the same substantial resource. There is no branch of Industry in which labor, directed by scientific knowledge, yields such Increased production In comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch or the public service to which the en couragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately extended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy; bet, on the contrary, undoubtedly results In losses of Immense sums annually that might be saved through well-directed efforts by the Government to promote tnis vital interest. The results already accomplished with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command of the department of agrloulture is an earnest of what may be expected with In creased appropriations for the several purpo ses indicated in the report of the commission er, with a view to placing the department npon a footing which will enable It to prose cute more effectively the objects for which it la established. Appropriations are needed for a more com plete laboratory, for the establishment of ft veterinary division, and a division of forestry, and for an Increase or force. The requirement for these and ether pur poses, Indicated in the report of the com missioner under the head of immediate neces sities of tbe department, will not Involve any expenditure ol money that the country can nut with propriety now undertake in tee in terests or agi lculture. It Is gratifying to learn from the bureau of education the extent to which educational privileges throughout the United States have been advanced during the year. No more fuudamentalresponsibilityrestsuponCongress than that of devh-lDg appropriate measures of financial aid to education, supplemental to local action in the Htates ana Terri tories, and In the District of Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders of our Gov ernment has not only furnished the basis for the support of the common school systems of the newer States, but laid the foundations for the maintenance of their Universities and Colleges of Agriculture and the mechanic arts. Measures In accordance with this traditional policy for the further benefit of all these in terests, and the extension of the tame advan tages to every portion of tbe couutry. it la hoped, will rectlve your favorable consider ation. To preserve and perpetuate the national lit erature should be among the foremost cares of the national Legislature. The library gathered at the Capitol ttiil lemalns unprovided with any suitable accommodations ior Its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance cf the collection, Increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of copyright, by dornest io and foreign ex changes, and by the scientific library of the fcmlthsonlan Institution, call for buhdlng ac commodations which shall be at once ade quate and Are-proof. The location of such a public building, which should provide for tbe pressing necessities of the preseot, and for the vast increase or tne nation s doors in tue lu ture, is a matter which addresses Itself to tbe discretion of CoDgres. It is earnestly recom mended as a measure which should unite all suffrages, and which should no longer be de layed. The Joint commission created bytheactfof Congress of August 2, 1876, for the purposefof supervising and directing the completion of the Washington National monument, of which commission the president Is a member, ha given careful attention to this subject, aud already the stiengthening of the founda tion has so far progressed as to Insure the en tire success of this part of the work A massive layer ol masonry lias been introduced below the original foundation, widening the baie, Increasing the stability of the structure, and rendering it possible to cairy tbe shaft to com pletion. It is earnestly recommended that such lurther appropriations be made for the contiuut-d prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of this national monument at an early day. In former messages, impressed with the 1m portance of the subject, I have taken occasion to commend to Congress the adopt on of a generous policy towe.rd the District of Colum bia. The report or the commissioners or the District, herewith transmitted, contains sug gestions and recommendations, to all of which I earnestly invite your careful attention. I ask your early and favorable consideration of the views which they express as to the urgent need of legislation for the reclamation of the marshes ol the Potomac and lu eastern branch within the limits of the city, and for the re pair of the streets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and now by decay rendered almost Impassuble, and a source of immine nt danger to the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the commission ers are wholly Inadequate for the accomplish ment of thete Important woras, and saould he supplemented by timely appropriations from the Federal treasury. The fining of the flats in front or the city will add to the adjacent laLds and parks now owned by the United States a large and valu able domain, sufficient, it la thought, to reim burse its entire cost, and will also, as an inci dental result, secure the permanent Improve ment ot the river for tbe purposes ot naviga tion. The constitution having invested Congress with supreme and exclusive Jurisdiction over the District or Columbia, Its citizens must ot necessity look to Congress alone for all need, ful legislation affecting their Interests; and as the territory of this District is the common property of the people of t he United States, who, equally with its resident citizens, are in terested in the prosperity of their capital, I can not doubt that you will be amply sus tained by the general voice or the country in any measures you may adopt for this purpose. I also Invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants or the public schools or this District, as exhibited in the report or tbe commissioners. While the number or pupils is rapidly Increasing, no adequate provision exists for a corresponding increase ot school accommodation, and the commissioners are without the means to u.eet this urgeut need. A number oi the buildings now used for school purposes are rented, aud -are. In important particulars, uu suited for tbe purpose. The cause of popular education In the District of Columbia is surely entitled to the same consid eration at tbe hands of the National Govern ment as In tbe several States and Territories, to which munificent grants of the public lands have been made for the endowment of schools and universities.
