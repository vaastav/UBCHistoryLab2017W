Tm people of Tuscumbia, Alabama, ! appealed to President Grant for relief for the citizens who were rendered destitute by the recent terrible disaster, which he graciously declined to grant Had an appeal been made for arms to maintain in power the carpet-bag plunderers it would hare met with a speedr and farorable response. A Speck of War. The colored troops continue to fight nobly. Dispatches from Vicksburgh, Miss., dated the 7th, report that seven hundred armed negroes attacked that eity that morning early, advancing upon it from six different roads. They were repulsed wish a loss of twenty fire killed and wounded and forty prisoners. The whites lost one killed and two wounded. The attack was made to Crosby (colored) as shiriff, reinstate ' who bad ! been pot ont for want of bond. At last accounts all was quiet in the city, bat the negroes are reported as burn ing houses in the country. ' Let us have peace." Thk leading journal of Texas, the Galveston Newt, takes this view of the political situation : It does not follow, because the states manship of the Republican party proved fatally defective in many par ticulars, and has finally worn ut the patience of the people, that while that statesmanship predominated in the public affairs no event happened which was to have been desired, and seed was not sown from which pre cious harvests may not iu good time be reaped. In the trials and vicissi tudes of these fourteen years past, les sons hare been learned which no other school could have taught. North and South, pride of section, pride of clan, of class and caste, hare been chasten ed. Conflict and friction hare purged away besetting faults, hare purified and widened perceptions, so that men. in both sections hare come to under stand each other better, hare come to realize that their liberties have been exposed to a common danger, and have eome to feel that, to save those liberties, and secure their material prosperity, they must desist from al ienation, discension, mutual distrust, proyocation and harassment. A Stupid Story Spoiled. The Radicals have been thrown into a terrible state of alarm by a story set afloat by the New York Republic, an oagan of the Administration, alleging that southern capitalists are engaged in buying up claims for slaves lost by reason of Lincoln's emancipation pro clamation and paying as high as $100 each for such claims. Of course all these stories are the most atupid non sense, bnt the Radical leaders vainly imagine they can use them to raise a scare among the people which will enable them to retain political power to be used hi plundering the country. Among those who, it is alleged, is en gaged in this great speculation of pur chasing claims is ex-Senator Yulee, of P'orida. How much truth there is in the silly story may be learned from the following dispatch from Savanna, Ga., dated November 29th : Ex-aenetor Yulee, of Florida, writes here saying : The statement now going she rounds of the press, to the effect that he is engaged in buying up slave claims in hopes that Cougress will ul timately pay for the emancipated ne groes, is absolutely false. He says the loss of slave property is one of the irremediable losses of war, and the idea of any possible reclamation is too wild to be entertained by any sane man. Tbe Cinse of Defeat Editor DejsBcratic Press : "What has caused this great com motion, the country through ?" asks the Clereiand Herald, commenting on the signal defeat the Republicans suf fered iu the late elections. It answers, and its answer is significant. "We beliere it isnmainly due to the course pursued bi the President and those intimate friends of his who are attempting the management of Re publican parly affairs." I answer, they have attempted the management of the affairs of the Na tion for toe past lew years, and sig nally failed. Pactfcation for a divided nation "was pre-eminently needed. In this the failure has been so palpable that I have frequently thought that if the Presidentand those -'intimate friends" of his would but permanently locate themselves at Long Branch, heeding tbe injunction, "Hands ofl !" the Sooth would have eliminated their Moses, their Kellogg, and Packard, and most of the brood of political cormorants whieh have preyed so raven-like upon their wasted substance. Seldom, if ever, washerc presented a better opportunity for the exercise of that greatness of mind which we express by the term magnanimity. "Victory over our countrymen," said the late Sumner, "shruld beknown on ly by the rights it secures." Why so marked a failure in this, as iu some other matters, let the Herald speak. It says : "11 teas a fearful thing lo raiseTa man from the humble position of a country dealer to that of Presi dent of theUniled States.'' The Herald seems to take quite a different view of Grant from what it did in "72. Tbe Party were then in the ascendant, now in the minority. Ben. Butler was no less the henchman of Gen. Grant then than now, yet the Herald calls him the rhinoceros-hided political infliction, tbe head-devil ot the Salary-grab larceny." This sounds as though they had confessed some of their sins and had fastened them lo the hords of a scape-goat, and were hieing to the wilderness of political forgetfulness. Boiler, Grant, Garfield, the Trinity in the Salary-grab larceny. Butler, the bold, frank and avowed advocate of the measure, look his pay, placed it where it would do the most good. Grant, "the great silent man," clutches action being taken by Cougress at that his aud fays nothing. Garfield's con- j time, but subject to any sal? factory nection with the measure is too well arrangements that might be made by necuou wnu .... . . ! tlle parties to the controversy, and known, as well as his attempt lo ex- whic, of al5 things, was1 most desira culpata himself. The elections of Octo- j 0le. it would be his duty, so far as it bar and November, if tho results are ; might be necessary for him to act, lo to be construed not as a "huge joke" j adhere to the Government heretofore w w . . . recognized by him. 'lhe President, but as the verdict of an outraged peo-, iugnbni(8 thu qup t() c pie, then these meh are rebuked. C Randolph, Dec. 7. 1871. Columbus Letter.

These ce9 are only seven feet long, a little ver s'r eet high, an(l three feet and nvo mooes in wiatn, witn a grated door, so that there is only eighteen inches square, in the aggregate, for the admission of air.

After Monday of last week the weather came down, or up, as bland as April. U. Columbus, Dec. 5, 1871. President's Message. The second session of the Forty third Cougress, commenced at noon on Monday, aud the Message of Presi dent Grant was delivered on the same xlay. The extreme length of the docu ment and the lateness of the hour at which it was received precludes the possibility of our publishing it this week. It is the want of funds and not of enterprise that prevents us from getting it printed abroad and laying it before our readers at this time in supplimented form. The Message is quite leagthy and no mere hastily prepared synopsis will do the document justice. The most important subjects discussed in it are those relating to finance, the larifi, civil service reform aud Arkan sas affairs. Upon the subject of the currency he declares most emphatical ly in laver of a speedy resumption of specie payment, aud argues the ques tion at considerable length, but names no day theretor, leaving Congress to devise the means to secure this desired end, it being the duty of Cougress lo do so. The legal-teiuler clause of the Currency Act should be repealed, to take effect us to contracts made alter a day to be fixed by law for its repeal, tower should be given to the Secre tary of the Treasury to obtain gold irom and alter the date fixed for the resumptiuyi of specie payments by the issuance of bonds. Iu addition to this, the reveuues of the Government should be in excess o! the expenditures. To support resumption, greater econ omy should be practiced in all de partments of the Government, and, if necessary, the customs aud internal revenue laws changed, in order to se cured large amount ot revenue. With the return of sppcie payments bank ing should be tree. The bill-holders should continue to be protected as at present, under tbe banking law. There should be no limitatiou to the volume ot currency, as the community itself slfould determine what amount is re quired for business transactions, in stead of leaving the Executive, the Secretary of lhe Treasury and Con gress to fix the limit. It would be the duly of Congress, however, to make regulations regarding Ire; banks of issue, and to state the conditions on which they cau be organized and transact business, the legislation to be in accordance with the new order ol things, or in other words, the resump tion of specie payment.;' There should be no monopoly by fixing the amount of i-sue. The .President recommends that Congress do not interfere with the . present currency act passed d: r ing the last session, unless to amend it so as to conform with a plan for the resumption of specie payments. Of the tariff he speaks briefly, sus taining the facts and suggestions coar tained in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. Ho advises fhlimi- tat:on of lhe tariff to a few articles, and suggests that the tariff on those few he made sufficiently high to afford the required revenue. He alludes to civil service reform, saying it has been as closely adhered lo as the Opposition manitested against it permitted. lis results have been beneficial, having elevated the capaci ty and tone of" appointments in the several Departments of the Govern ment, but it would be impossible to continue the reform without the di rect support of Congress, sanctioned by the people. The President devotes much space to affairs in Arkansas, giving the rea son why he declined lo interfere in the n cent difficulties in that State, and he adverts lo the facts narrated in his special message to Congress in Febru ary, 1873, relative to Louisiana, in which he said he had no specific rec ommendaliou to make on the subject ; but if there were any practical way ot removing these difficulties by legisla tion, then he earnestly requested that t he question might be taken up at that session of Congress. Ho was extreme ly ar.xiotn to avoid a pretense of un due interference in State affairs, and if Congress differed with him as to what ought to be done, he requested its immediate decision to that effect : otherwise he should feet obliged, as far as he could by the exercise of leg itimate authority, and put an end to the unhappy controversy which dis turbed the peace and prostrated lhe bu-iness of Louisiana by recognition and support ot that Government which was recognized and upheld by the Cours ot the Slate. It seemed advis able that he should slate which course he should feci hound to pursue iu ref erence th the m ilter in the event of no gress, and will continue lo act as he has heretofore acted relative to the af- fairs of Louisiana, witless otherwise controlled by Congress. The President reiterates his confi dence in the Indian peace policy. If adhered to, be says, it will produce additioual beneficial effects, and ulti mately free the frontier of Indian de predations. lie recommends that the pensions which were cut off from the soldiers of the war of 1812 by act of Congress be restored to them, they being all eld persons, who could have taken no part in the rebellion, and the services for which they were awarded pensions were in defense of the whole country. He alludes to the reports of the heads of the several Departments which accompany the message, and calls attention to their respective rec ommendations, lie again recommends the passage of a law establishing a Court for the adjudication of claims of aliens against the Government, a bill for this purpose having been in troduced by Judge Lawrence at the previous sessions of Congress. There are several other matters treated on in the message which we have not time or space here to notice. Illinois Correspondence. Winchester, Nor, 26th. 1874. TO Tax 

K9ITOB OF TBI DzMOCZATIC PMSS : Enclosed find two dollars in pay ment for a copy of the Press for my j good old mother, who resides iu For- tage county. The Pncss is receired here regularly and eagerly sought after in our household. When once taken jip by any member of the family it is not laid aside until perused thorough ly, especially the local columns, adver tisements and all. To-day is Thanksgiving-Day. Our turkey was led to the block and sacri ficed on the altar of Than ksgi vine. It was eue of our own raising, and never paid the profits ot the middle man. It bad eaten a bushel ot meal, costiug 80 cents, one bushel of shelled corn, cost ing 50 cents, besides crumbs aud wast age from our table. Turkeys eau be bought in the market here from the middle-men for half a dollar ahead. We now begin-to believe that tbe mid dle man is an indispensable being, of-, tea courenient when we have auything to sell, or when we want to buy. Winchester is the county-seat of Scott county, or "Little Scott" as it is familiarly called, from the fact that it is oue of the smallest counties in the state. The town contains about two thousand inhabitants, aad the county about thirteen thousand. The busi ness of tbe county consists principally of agricultural pursuits. Winchester being tbe only town of any importance where mercantile trade and manufac turing is carried oa to any extent. Tbe principal farm products of the county are winter wheat aud com. The wheat crap is always a sure crop here, and corn never fails of a fair re turn and a handsome profit to the farmer. No corn is raised in the coun ty for export, it nearly all is fed to hogs and cattle until they are prepar ed for market. No county of its size in the state feeds as many hogs and cattle as this county. No section of Illinois can produce a better grade ef winter wheat, which often will arer age from twenty to twenty-three bush els to the acre. It is not uncommon to hear our farmers boast of raising tie hundred bethels of shelled corn to the acre. Very little rye, barley or oats raised in this county. The hay crop consists of timothy and clorer mixed. The pasturage is blue grass and clover, white and red. Winchester supports one cxteusire plow manufactory, two extensive car riage aud wagon shops, oue large fur niture manufactory, three tile aud stouc-ware factories, a coal shaft, i)J feet deep, which employes thirty men, a packinghouse, two elevators, besides numerous small shops, mercantile and business houses that era usually fouud at a western county seat of two thou sand people. Scott county was once the home of the immortal Douglas. It was here he opened his first school as a teacher, and for three long mtnths "taught the young idea how to shoot," at the log school house in Winchester. It was here he made las maideu speech on the "political topics of the day," and received the applause of the hardy yebtuaury who settled at au early day along the valley of the beautiful river UinoU, which is leu miles west ol here, 'f floss honest souqf, toil then Lol4 Douglas they would send him lo Wrtihiiigtou. and tore enough they did send him there, and had he lived they would have made him President iustcad ot that man they call Genera!
