Tho International Postal Congress, which met at Paris May 1, IS78, aud coutluucd In session until Juuo 4 of tho samo year, was composed of delegates fiom nearly all tho civ ilized couutrlcs of the world. It adopted a new convt utiou, to Uko tlio placo of tho treaty concluded at Berne, October 9, 1871; which goes Into cfiect on tlio lit of April, 1679, bo tween tho couutrlcs whoso delegates havo signed It, It was rat Mod and Approved, by and with the consent of tho President, August 13, 1878. A synopsis of this Universal Postal Conven tion will bo found lu tho report of tho Post master General and tho full text lu tho appen dix thereto. In Us origin tho Postal Union coiupilsc-d tncuty-thieo coun tiles, having n population of tbreo hundred aud fifty millions or pcoplt. On tho 1st of April next It will couiprihO foity-throo countries and colonies, with a population of tnoro than slxhuudrcd aud fifty millions of people, and will soon, by tho accession of tho few remaining couutrlcs and colonies which inniutiln organized postal services, constitute, iu fict as well as lu name, as Its new title indicates, a Universal Union, reguhitlug, upon a uniform basis of cheap jtustiga rites, tho postal intercourse between all civilized nations. Somo embarrassment has arisen out of tho ton 11 let betwecu tho cusUuns laws of this country and the piuvlsions of tho postal couventiou lu icgard to tho transmis sion of foielgu books aud newspapers to this country by mall. It Is hoped that Cougress w 111 bo able to deviso some menus of reconcil ing tho diUlcultlcs which htvo thus been treated, so as to do Justice to all parties In volved. Tho business of tho Supremo Court, and of tbo com ts In many of tho circuits, has In creased to such an extent during the past years that additional legislation Is Imperatlvo to re lievo and picveut t he delay of Justice and pos slblo oppiewiouXo suitors, which Is thus occa sioned. Tho encumbered condition of thcso dockets Is presented anew In tho report of tho Attorney Ucncril.aud the remedy suggested Is earnestly urged for Cougreskioual tctlou. Tho creatlou of additional circuit Judges, as pioposed, would alTord u complete ieuieJj,aud would Imolve an expense, at tho present rato or salaries, of not uioro that $00,000 a ear. Tho annual uports of tho Secretary of tbo Interior aud of the Commis sioner of Indian Affairs present nu chborato ntcouui oi tne i resent coudit'on of the ludlaii tribes aud of that branch of the public scrvico .v .. . ,u ,,,. ..., u ,,!. which uiluUters to their Interests hlle tho ' conduct of the Iudiaus generally has been or-1 derly, aud their relations with their neighbors friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable in their character, but icm lined happily confined to a comparatively small number of Iudlans. The duuniteut among the Bannocks, which ltd (list to soma acts of violence on the part of some mem beiiof thotribo und finally to tbo outbreak, appears to ha e bceu caused by au msiifficlcucy or loud on tho resenntlon, aud this iusuffi elency to have bceu owing to the Inadequacy of tho appropriations made by Congress to tho wants ol the Indians at a timewhenthe Iu dlaus were nrevtuted fiom sumdviuir tho dofl- tleuoy by hunting. After au arduous puisult by tho troops of tho United States, aud seveiaf ongaKomeuts, tho host Ho IudtsDi WLra rwluctd to mi bin tlnn. and the larger part of them kiirrendtied them Bclvosas prisoners. In this connection I dc klro to cull attention to tho rutumiutudatluu iimdoby thoSecrelaiy of tbo Iutciior that a Biillklent fund ho placed ut the disposal of the Executive, to be used, with proper accounta bility, at discretion, In sudduu cmurgiutles of tho Iudhui service. ihouthcr cum) vi dUluibauco was that of a band of Northern Cheyenne who suddenly left their reaetvatloa In the Indian Territory and marched rapidly through the States of JCausas and .Nebraska In the direction of their old buatlng-grouuds, commltxlng murders and other crimes on their war. From documents accompanying the report of tho Secretary of uie interior, it appears mat tuts disorderly baod was m fully supplied with the necessaries of llfo as the four thousand seveu hundred other Indians who remained quietly on the reservation, and thst the dUturltauco was ctuscd by in on of a restless and mischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost the wholo of this band have sur rendered to the military authorities, and It Is a gratifying fact that, when some of them had taken refuge fa tho aunp of tho ficd Cloud Sioux, with whom they had boon In friendly relations, UmsBJoux held thorn as prisoners and readily gave them up to the otllcors of tho United States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming in mors to tho contrary notwithstanding, they havo uniformly shown over slnco the wishes they expressed at tho council of September, 1877, had been complied with. 1Mb the Secretary of tho Iuterlor and tho BecrataryofWaruiiltelti the recommendatiou that provision be made by Congress for the or ganization of a corps of mounted Indian aux iliaries, to be under tho control of tho army, and to be used for the parposo nf kccplnc the Indians on their roservatloni and proventlng or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concur la this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate nay from tho Government, would considerably wcakoti tle restless clement among the Iu dtaus by withdrawing from Itanumberef yoong meuand glvlug them congenial employment nnder the Government, it being a matter of ox perlcuco that Iudlaus tn our scrvico almost without exception aro faithful Ju tho rcrforui ance of tho duties assigned to thein. Such an organisation would matcrlslly aid tho army In win nixuuipnsuiueuioi a io.sk lor wmcii iu nu merical strcuglh Is sometimes found Jnsutfl cJcuL But. while the emnloTmcnt of force for tlm prevention or repression of Indian troubles Is oi occasional necessity, aud wise preparation should bo made to tliat cud, greater relianou mast bo placed on huniano and civilizing agencies for tho ultimate solution of what Is called tho Indian problem. It may bo very dlfllcalt and require much patient effort to curb the unrulr spirit of the tavatro Indian to tho restraints of civilized life, but experience snows mas it is not impossiruo. aiany or the tribes which are now quiet and orderly aud Self-supporting were once as savago as any that at present roam over the plains or In tho mountains oi tne ur wesr. ami wero iiien con sidered Inaccessable to civilizing influence.

Wo owo It to them na n moral daty to help themlu attaining at least that degree of civili zation which they may ho able to roach. It Is not ouly our duty It Is also our Interest to do so. inuiaus wuo navo become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an Interest In property. will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and disturbing eloracnt. It Is also a wcll-authcn tlcatod fact that Indians are apt to bopeaccabto and nulct when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the expressions of luuiansiuemsoivosanii irotn many concurring reports, that thcro Is a steadily increasing desire, even among Indians belong! 113 to compirauveiy wild tribes, to have their chil dren educated, I Invito attention to the renorts of tho Siv. rctary of tho Interior nud tho Commissioner of ludlau Affilrs, touching tho experiment ro toutly Inaugurated lu taking fifty Indian cmuircu, uoys aim eiris, irom ti ilk rent tribes, to tho Hampton Normal Airriculturd Iusti. lute, In Virginia, where they aro to receive an elementary English education and training in agriculture nud other useful work, to bo io turned to their tribes after tho romnlctud cnurso as interpreter, instructors, ami exam ines, it is rciorteti mat mo otiiecr cimrcwi with the selection of thoie children might havo had thousands of ronnir Indlftim aut with htm had It becu possible- to make provision for incm. 1 agree wim tlio secretary of tho Inte rior In savins that "the result of this lutcre-ii. lug experiment, If favorable, may bo dostlno 1 10 Dccomoan importaut fictor in tlio advance incut of civilization among tho Indlius." Tho question whether a change lu tho con trol of tho Indian service shoild bo made was at tho last session of Congn ss, referred to a commit too for Inquiry and report Without desiring to autlclMto that report, I venture to express tho hopo that In tlio decision of so Im portant n question tlio a lews expressed nbovo may not bo lost sight of, and that tho decision, whatever It may be, will arrest further ablu tion of this subject, such agitation being apt to producon disturbing effect upon tho scrvico as well as on tho Indians themselves. In thoeiirollmcntof tho bill making appro priations for sundry civil expenses, nt tho loat session of Congress, tint portion which pro vided for tho continuation of tho IlntHprlngs commission was omitted. As tho commission had completed tho work of taking testimony on tho many conflicting claims, tho suspen sion of their labors, before determining tho rights of claimants, threatened, for a time, to embarrass the Jutertsts, not ouly of tho Gov tnimeut, but also of a largo number of the citizens of tho HotSnriucs, who wero wilting for final actlou on theli claims before begin nlug contemplated improvements. In order to prcvontscrlousdlfileuttlcs, which were ap prehended, nud at tho solicitation of many leading titlzcus of Hot hpi lugs' and others Interested lu tho welfare of tho town tho Secretary of tho Interior wus authoilztd to request tlio lata commissioners to take eliargo of tlio records of their proceedings, and to perform such work as could properly bo dono by them under such circumstances to facilitate the future adjudi cation of the claims t nu tuily d ly, and to preserve tho status or tlio claimants until their rinlits should bo finullvdutaimiuud. Tlm juio commissioner compiicu wun tiut to ques t, aud report that tho testimony In all tno cases lias been written out, examined, briefed, and so urrauod as to facilitate an early settlement whou authorized by law. It Is rocomuicuded that tho reuuiiltu author ity bo givuuut as early 11 day In ihu sculun us itosslble, and that a fiir compensation to ul lowed tlio lato coram lrf&toucrs for tlio expenso uicurrea nun ins moor pcuoriucu uy mem since tho 23 th of Juuo last. I Invito tho attention of Congress to tho recommendations mado by tho becrotary of tne luteiiorwitu rogum to the piuscrvatlou of the timber 011 the nubile lands of tho United States. Tho protection of the public prop erly is one of tho Hist duties of tho Govern mo nt. The Department of tho Iuterlor should, therefore, bo eiiahlod by sufilclout appropria tions to cuforco the laws in thnt respect, lint this matter appears still uioro luxuriant as a question of public economy. Tho rapid de struction of our forests Is au ovll fiaught with tho gravest tousuqueucis, tsputUIly lu tho mountainous districts, whero tlm rocky slopes, ouco denuded of their tiecs, will roiualu so for ever, lheru tho Injury, ouco done, cannot bo repaired.

Utporlouce accordingly bath shown that they aro very cheap lustrumenU of iuiinonsa national ben oflt.'r Tho great preponderance of the agricultural over any other Interest la tho United States entitles It to all tho consideration claimed fcr It by Washington. About ono-hnlf of tho population of the United States Is engaged hi agriculture Tlio value of tho agricultural products of the United States for the year 1678 Is estimated at $3,009,030,000. Tho ex ports of agricultural products for tho year 1377, as appears from the report ofthe Bureau orgtattstlcs, wero $331,000,000. The great ex tont of our country, with Its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce within our own borders, aud by our own labor, not only the nocessaries, but most of tha luxuries that are construed In civilized countries. Yet, not withstanding onr advantages of soil, cllmato, and liitercummanleatioa, it appears from tho statistical statements la the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture that we luipoit annually from foreign lands many millions of dollars' worth of agricultural products which could be raised la our own country. Numerous questions arise la tho practice of advanced agriculture, which cau ouly bo an swered by experiments often costly and samo times fruitless, which are beyond tho means of prlvato Individuals, andaroajust and proper chargo on the wholo nation for tho benefit of the nation. It Is good policy, especially in times of depression and uncertainty la other business pursuits, with a vast aica of unculti vated, aud hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to en courage, by every proper and legitimate moau, the occupation and tillage of tha soil. Tho efforts of tho Department of Agriculture to Btimnlato old aud Introduco now agricultu ral Industries, to Improve the quality and In crease the quantity of our products, to deter mine tho value ol old or establish the Import ance of now methods of culture, aro worthy of your careful and favorable consideration and assistance by such appropriations of money and enlargement of facilities as may soem to bs demanded by the present favorable condi tions for tbo growth and rapid devclopmont of this Important lutereit. The abuse of animals In transit is widely at tracting publicatlcntlon.

I refer In what Is known as tho renny l.unch. Washington Is a city which naturally has tnoro than Its sharo of poor people, for they como hero from all parts ofthe country In avatn search for Government positions, And It Ls, lu addition, the centre of the indigent negro population of many adja cent States. About a year ago, at a time when thero was unusual suffcrlug hero among tho poorer classes, and all manner of suggest lout wero being made s to what should he dono to relievo tho provailhig-povcrtv and want, a hdy named Mrs. Hbvrts (Uriel what Is now known hero by everybody ns tlio "penny lunch." Shown nt that time, or hndbccu.a clerk In the Interior Dipirtmcnr, aud was a regular contributor to one of tho Sunday papers, Bho conceived the Idea of supplying hungry peoplo with a lunch for ft penny, aud from a very small bcglnutng sho lias mado tho lunch a success aud Increased Its advantages, until now It is a permanent institution, aud ouo of the moat sen si bio and practical chari ties iu tlio couutry, Mrs. ICohcrt was aided lu tho undertaking by somo friends, who ap preciated her energy and knew tho kindness of her bonrt. hho began by soliciting per sonally siu ill contributions from tho business men, a bag of (lour here, a bushel of hems there, a barrel of meal of ono person, n load of coalofanolher.fi hundred loaves of bread of auolher, cornod beef of another, fresh meat of another, pork of another, a load of wood of another, and so on through tho city. She re fused nothing, but patiently kept at work. In due time she lutd money cuough to rent for a month two small rooms in n tack street. Hho borrowed a stove, begged a few plates, bowls, cups and saucers, sjtoons, knlvrs nud forks, and other necessary Implements, bho had printed n number of small tickets, rending: 'One Cent, flood for Cue Lunch. No. 12I' II street." Those tickets sho popularized by selling them lu packages of fifty aud one huu dred to I idles and gentlemen, who In turn gave them to beggars and dcstlluto persons In tho Btreets. Mrs. RoWts started very modestly, giving her culiro tlmo to tlio cuterprlso and working with surprising zeal and patience. At first she gav e a plate of soup and a plcco of brea J for a penny, and before sho know It sho could not supply tho wants of tho-o who called.
