To tho Editor of the Intelllieucer B As our Legislature wilt bo convened at an early date it appears to us that it would not be inappropriate to dlsousa the merits of some of the gentlemen a whom publlo opinion points ont an p proper persons for the position of otU* 9 oers of the Legislative body* We have no hesitation in declaring that many membera oan be found who would discharge the dntlea of apeaker with complete satisfaction. In this seotlon of country many Re Bubilcaub recognizing the merits of apt* Putnam, feel anxious that he Putnam would receive the position of a speaker. b Captain Putnam 1b a gentleman of " scholastic attainments?liberal culture, of suave manners?thoroughly conver= sant With parliamentary law, and well acquainted with the customs of legislative bodies; and, furthermore, an ar= dent Kepublioan, devoted to the beat Intervals of the liepublloan party. An . a Speaker of the House, we have no doubt that Captain Putnam would dis r charge the duties with credit to himaeir H and satisfaction to the members In 1 hie election a merited tribute would be j paid to the Kepubllcana of the { tiiibd delboath dihtriot. 1 npain. A Hold Ntroke Contemplated by Prim. * Pakis, Doc. 12. Private advloea received here assert t that General Prim oontemplates a coup ^ d'etat, and that he Is sure of one hun~ J dred and olghty voloea in the Cortes. " Ho will proclaim the Duke of Genoa * King, and then present the law to the * Cortes making himself Regent during the minority. He relies on the support * of the army, the Generals belDg in his favor, and ne will send for the Dake of Uenoa to our/ out the eobemv. Ou tba other bud, a public illapttcli from Madrid announoee that Qenernl Prim made a speech yeaterday la Ibe Cotton, In whlah he denied any Intention of making a couj> d'etat. He declared, however, the belief that an luimenie majority of the country waa In favor of tbe Dulte of Ganoai that the Duobeu of Genoa waa willing her sou ihould ao cept the crown, and In all probability the Duke would soon be proclaimed King.
