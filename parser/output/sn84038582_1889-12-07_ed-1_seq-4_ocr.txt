A Tuscon, Arizona, telegram of the 4th says: "Surveyor General John son, of Arizona, reported the alleged Peralta grant adversely in October, but the report was not made public until to-day. This alleged grant was for 5,000,0M) acres of the public-domain and Included several towns and cities, and the estimated value or the prop erty claimed was not less than $25, 000,000. Forgery, fabrications of pa pers, and the counterfeiting of the Spanish King's' seal are fully shown. The Surveyor-General recommends prosecution of the parties connected with the fabrication of the claim, and that it be, not allowed by Congress. Tt Js only fair to say that the work of ex posing this gigantic fraud, the collec tion of the evidence of the forgeries, etc., as the writer happens personally to know, is a work for which Arizona and the nation haves to thank the late Surveyor-General John Hise, whose death was so recently recorded. Gen. Hise found the whole land grant claim business of that territory rotten to the core, and he made the exposure of those rotten claims a special study and a special work during his incum bency of the office of Surveyor-General; and his annual reports to the land of fice will show that this Peralta at tempted steal is not the, only land stealing he had prevented In that territory. The president yesterday sent to the Senate the name or Justice David J. Brewer, of Kansas, to be associate Jus tice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Justice lirewer (of the Kaneas Supreme Court) is a man about 50 years of age, and was born in Smyrna, Asia Minor, where his father was then located as missionary. He has served 12 years on the Supremo Iienchof Kansas. The appointment is well spoken of in Washington. A large number or recess appointments were also sent In to the Senate. Sena tor Sherman has introduced a new an tl trust bill aimed at all trusts, which are by it declared unlawful. Mrs. Ella C. Worth, who has been "bucking the tiger" on the bucket Khop end of the board of trade, for some months, was yesterday taken to New York state on the charge of forg ing securities to theatnountof $25,000. Richard C. dishing was elected mayor or Omaha yesterday. He is a democrat. 

FRIDAY. The hotel fires yesterday were at Pittsburgh, Pa., and E. Tawas, Mich. In the former city the Monongahela House, an old and well-known hotel, was destroyed. There wens 200 guest s, but all escaped uninjured. At E. Tawas the Union Mouse burned, and two charred IhhIIcs were found in the ruins, and live men were injured. Wheat still continues weak and lost W yesterday, selling at"HJc for Decem ber and 83Jc for May. Corn closed at ilOic for January. Oals touched 2:ic for May and closed at 223e. Cat tle recepts, 15,000; .'1,000 or which were Texan's; no change in prices. Hogs re ceived, 25,000; prices about the same, $3.05 to $.'i.K0. Sheep in active demand, but no change In prices. Edward Silcott, cashier of the scr-geant-at-arms, Washington, has left the country, carrying with him some $70,un) or funds for which the ser-geant-at-arms Is responsible, lie went to New York last Saturday, and on Monday telegraphed he was detained. This is the last that has been heard of him. The President and wife, Vice-President and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Wan namakerand Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson, started for Chicago to-day to be pres ent at the opening of the, Auditorium building. The latest trust is the organizat ion of the straw and rag pajier makers, to restrict production and advance prices. The headquarters will be In Chicago. Attorney If ynes occupied the time yesterday with his argument in the Cronin case. After endless drumming, maneuver ing and caucusing, each of the two political parties in Chicago has suc ceeded In nominating live candidates for drainage commissioners. As the board, which is. to consist of nine members, is to le elected under the cumulative, or minority, representa tion voting system, neither party can elect more than flro members, or have a majority of over one. The tight Is, therefore, to win that one man. As each of the parties stoutly maintains that all the nominees of the other party are boodlers, and care only for tbc cilice on account of the stealing there Is In it, and as the people no doubt have abundant reason to In-Ueve that both parties are right in the charge, It would 6eem to be the only wise thing for .the people to do, as they are otherwise sure to le robbed of from $15,000,000 to 30,000,000, to save themselves In time by at once abandoning the whole drainage pro ject. , 

TIIK MKSH.MiK. The President's message, delivered to Congress on Tuesday, contrary to abundant adverse newspaper advice and general expectation, is a docu ment of intolerable length, containing over 15,000 words against the 5,000 of President Cleveland's last message. Its salient points are: Depreciation of a continued exces sive surplus In the national treasury, and a recommendation of its decrease, 1st. by a such a revision of the tariff that shall tend rather to increase th; an lessen the extent or the present meas ure or protection enjoyed by our man iifactiirers: in other words, to cut down tarilf revenues by enlarging the prohibition in preference to the prin ciple of reduction; and 2d, by the to tal repeal of the tobacco tax. As another means of keeping down the surplus, he would not only contin ue, but enlarge the present liberal ap propriations to the navy. As another means he recommends liberal subsi dies toward building up our merchant marine; and lastly, still In the same direction, lie recommends Increased liberality In river and harbor appro priations. He is rather chary in recommenda tions on the silver question; thinks it would be unsafe to increase the pres ent rate of coinage, though he would by no means abandon it. Upon the whole, he, offers a good word for Secre tary Windom's plan of "issuing cer tificates on deposits of silver bullion." And lastly, as the only other point to be noticed here, the President goes the full leriL'th of the extreinest ne- grophobistsorhis party in recommend ing the strongest measures to secure, by congressional legislation, full ex ercise of the right to vote to the ne groes of the south. As a whole, the message is unques tionably in the interest of the monop olists, the pension and the subsidy grabbers. It is Chicago platform Republican ism In its strongest and deepest col ors just such a message as was fore shadowed by the election of Heed as Speaker or the House. 

TIIK HUItriXH. It Is noted that President Harrison almost copies the language or Presi dent Cleveland in deprecating the evils or a large surplus in the treasury, agreeing with him "that the collec tion or money not needed tor public uses imposes an unnecessary burden upon the people." Hut his remedy for the evil is exactly that in wnicn Mr. Cleveland said the evil consists. The great evil he saw in an excessive sur p'us was that it led to reckless and ex travagant appropriations and expendi tures. President Harrison exactly suggests this "evil" as his remedy The pension roll, which already in volves the enormous sum of !M),(X)0,000 a year and under present laws is in creasing at the rate of $10, (MM), OIK) a year, he would enlarge by greater lib erality, such as passing at once an " indigent" pension bill, to be followed ultimately by a "service" bill, to In clude all the surviving soldiers of the war, or their widows and orphans Then he would add some $15,000,000 a year to the annual expenditures by the passage of the Itlal r educational bill; he would also add large sums for our coast defenses, ror increasing the navy, ror subsidies to build up a mer chant, marine, and he would cut off $:i2,ooo,nnn from the annual revenue by abolishing the tobacco tax, and $25, 000,0)0 more by removing the tax on spirits useil in the arts. Under Cleve land theannual surplus exceeded $100, 000, (KM) ; for the past year it had fallen to $50,0(K),MM), and under the Tanner system of surplus smashing the highest estimated surplus ror the current year is $i:i,(KK),(KK). Anybody with "hair an eye" can see that with the adoption or less than a moiety or the President's recommendations, the surplus must at once disappear, and ir congress should act favorably on all his suggestions, instead of a surplus, an inevitable de ficit of 

$100,(MK),(KK at the end of the year Instead of a comfortable surplus Is the pleasant prospect. ;ov. Gordon i cincAoo. The speech of Gov. Gordon, of Geor gia, at Central Music Hall, in Chicago, on Saturday evening, Is admitted by ev.n the Inter Ocean, to have been "ad mirable in tone, and took the question he was discussing out of the ruts in which politicians are accustomed to run them." Wo should say so! Gov. Gordon intimated, (for he did not say so in tenus,)that after the war the south had had tlve years of military rule, al solutely in the interest of the negroes, during which they were marched in columns, under military leaders, to the polls to vote the republican ticket in solid blocks, the major part of the white population not voting, either from choice or because disfranchised as reliels. It may have Win well intend ed for the negro's good, but it was a misguided philanthropy, serving only to estrange the races, sunder the ties which bind them together ini com mon Interest, and was as a myriad of barlx-d wire fences across the pathway of the South In attempting to .deal with the question in the right spirit. The state government of th ) South was then turned over to their own people. At that time, Georgia found Just fi()(M) colored children in her public schools and her school ex chequer bankrupt. To-day she has over 100,000 colored pupils in her public schools, with her exchequer ex panding and the schools multiplying year by year. Then there was not a military organization in the state; now in every city and in every section march colored military organizations beneath the stars and stripes, recog nized by the state authorities, armed, equipped and enjoying every exemp tion accorded to her most favored citi zen soldiery. At the same, all over that land, in churches and schools, rise to heaven monuments of the munificence of the southern white man to the southern colored man. "Now, my countrymen," said Mr. Gordon, "tell me, if you please, what does all this meat.? A re all these facts consistent with hostile intent ora pur pose to oppress? Are sch:M)l-booksand churches, and rifles and artillery, the implements with which we would arm a race which we intend to oppress? Hut, my countrymen, 1 anticipate your anxious inquiry as to what is to become of all this question. It is not much of a problem after a:l. My pro foundest conviction is if left or even if largely left to the two races, to the people who are most deeply Interested in its peacerul and justsolution, whose homes and civilization depend upon it, it would be solved in Justice and in the benefit of both races." Doubtless, with such racts before them, the American people would be ready almost with one voice to leave the question where Gov. Gordon says it belongs, but for one stout "wire fence" in the way; and that is. that the plan does not Insure to the Repub lican party what it has set Its heart upon having, the entire negro vote of tins south in one solid block. The establishment of perfect good feeling and community of interest between the races would be sure death to any such calculation. There will never b entire peace until the races are united politically as well as industrially. HANK CIRCULATION. Senator Farwell again presents his bill In the Senate to perpetuate tin national banking system by making state, municipal and other bonds the basis of circulation. Illinois once tried that plan, and when the crisis of 1857 came and state and municipal bonds suddenly dropped from par down to figures In the unit column, most of our banks went down with a crash and the losses of the people mounted into millions. What Is the need of national bank paper at all? Most national banks adnit that there is no profit In the circulation and they can get along quite as well without it. Then the amount of that circulation is constantly varying, and often when the paper is most needed the banks are drawing It in. There is no way in which the circulation of the country can be kept even with the constantly increasing business demands of the country but by a scientifically regulat ed issue of paper money by the govern ment and judicious gradating of the si I ver coi nage. For the past fi ve years the circulation of the country has diminishing while the business de mand for it has steadily increased. The result is serious depreciation in values, injurious to business and ruinous to the debtor classes. DKAINAUK TKOIIH.KM. The Chicago drainage business, ac cording to the local news papers, starts out so badly as to presage with almost dead certainty a worse ending. The two parties have nominated II ve candi dates each for the drainage board, to conslstof nine members. The Tribune, while supporting the nominees of its own party, admits that the boodlers labored to get a dishonest set of candi dates for both sides, and "have been about as successful as they expected." So which ever party gets the majority or one in the board, "the boodlers see their way clear to have the control of the work and to make it cost as many millions as It ought to, with great per sonal proltt to themselves." As a last resort to head off the bood lers, who are thus far beautifully in the lead, a citizens' meeting has been called to nominate tlve "honest" men to run against the two partisan bood- ler tickets. Hut the puzzle is to find the live honest men. The boodlers having proved strong enough to con trol the nominations of the political partles.of course are also strong enough to control the citizens' movement, and the result, if a nomination Is made at all, will be boodler ticket No. 3. Chi cago (ught to make a liberal Invest ment in Diognes lamps and send a few hundred cynics around in search of five honest men; though even that device is as improbable of success as the pro verbial futile search for sunbeams at the bottom of a well. They are not there, is what's the matter. The Hoard of Supervisors will meet in this city on Monday next. The meeting will be an Interesting one, es pecially in view of the conditioa of the county's finances. Already it has had advanced to it, $2,000 by Mr. Fred Fades, of Streator, which by: Monday win an uau utxu uwi "t jo , uwLLiwt and court fees; and as no taxes will be available for at least two months, the question Is, what is going to be done? Doc. Norton might help out a little in the way or paying ror fin-ding prison oners at the Jail by returning that t l.ooo, as he ought to do or quit his howling about boodlers; but as he will probably not distinguish himself In that way, it will devolve upon the learned and astute members to pro vide a means to pay the bills that may be audited during the session. It is of course, to bo supposed that the Doc, who certainly engineered his own financial scheme very successfully and the brilliant financiers who voted for that grab who are still left on the Hoard, will find a way out of the hole. Hut it is pretty certain that for the blunder of last year's low assessment, the county treasury Is going to go broke several times before the defic iency is finally made up. It was one of his standing complaints against the Cleveland administration, in his little stump speeches to visiting delegations at Indianapolis before the election, that it deposited large sums of the public money in national banks without interest, upon the security of government bonds, and the President injects the same little stump speech in his message, declaring the practice an "unauthorized and dangerous ex pedient." Meantime ho allowed the "dangerous" practice to be continued by Secretary Windom, who reports $50,000,000 of the public moneys thus on deposit in the banks to-day. The President seems to have forgotten his Sunday school lesson about a beam in the eye. President Harrison appears to have made a "hit" in the appointment of Hrewer of Kansas as a Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court, in place of Stan ley Matthews, deceased. The Presi dent wanted to appoint his old friend and business partner attorney general Miller, but so much objection was made by Senators that he was pro voked and appointed a man who was neither an applicant himself and whom nobody else had named to the President. Yet the appointment is heartily commended as an excellent one by all parties, even the friends of the other candidates heartily approv ing it. Perhaps the ten "boodlers" whom the political parties in Chicago have put in nomination for drainage com inislioners will not be quite so eager to be elected as they were, now that the President mentions in his message the conclusion of a new extradition treaty with Great Hritain, which puts an end to Canada as an asylum for boodlers and other thieves escaping from this side across the border. It is pretty safe to say that at least that part of the President's message in which he inveighs against trusts as "dangerous conspiracies against the public good and should be made the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation," was not written byHlaine, who, you know, said trusts were "priv ate affairs with which Congress had nothing to do." The last "simple and certain cure" brought to light for diptheria, of which there are said to be cases in this city, Is pineapple juice. It is claimed to have been the universal remedy in the South for years and that its use in the most malignant cases of black dipther ia has been attended with marvelous results. The first "business" done by con gress after reading the President's message was the appointment of a committee on the "world's fair." Every effort will be made to decide the question of Its location before the holiday adjournment. The drainage Chicago seems to stand most in need of just now is to drain the "dirty pool of politics," the maleria from which has apparently caused such a mortality among her honest men that even five are sought for in despair. The reason why the Chicago republi cans joined in paying such high honors to Gov. Gordon, of Georgia, on his recent lecturing visit to that city was probably because he had served with distinction in the Confederate army. Chicago yews: The two Illinois sen ators rode in a cab behind a white horse to call on President Harrison the other day. It is understood that the President asked them where they were on the night of May 4. At the late election In Mississippi, Stone, the Democratic candidate, re ceived 84,045 votes, and Chalmers, the Republican candidate, received six votes. From which it appears that stone was elected.

TOASTS. The banquet, closing the Patriarch's day in Ottawa, given by E. Y. Griggs Temple No. 13, Patriarchal Circle, in the evening, was one of the pleasant est affairs held in Ottawa in years. The arrangement of the tables, which were placed in triangular form, as emblematic of the order, and the menu, were under the direction of the ladies of the Episcopal Church, who amply sustained their well known reputation for the elegance of their cuisine. At the head of the tables, just in front of the Toast Master, Thomas E. Mackinlay, was the purple velvet banner of E. Y. Griggs Temple, a splendid piece of art, emblematic of the order. Emblazoned upon it was the "roval purple pansv," the emblem of the "Golden Hand," the ladies' so ciety. The banner is a very expensive affair, and is considered to be one of the finest in the United States. Plates were laid for one hundred and twenty guests, each place being furnished with a card bearing the name of the lady or gentleman intended to occupy it. Toast Master Mackinlay, having de livered a short address, introduced Grand Chaplain Chamberlin, who spoke at some length upon the "Sword and the Word," as applied to the Pat riarchal Circle. Sir Knight Duncan McDougall de livered the address of welcome. Dur ing the course of his remarks he said: "The Patriarchal Circle, which you have the honor to represent and we the honor to entertain, is the out growth of a man's present needs in the direction and along the lines indi cated. In the full vigor of splendid young manhood, with measureless possibilities, we have a right to ex pect, and do sincerely hope, your meet ing here may contribute in large measure to their accomplishment. These civic societies arc organized, not for the purpose of mutual helpful ness in securing business, proressional or political success, but for the pur pose of mutual helpfulness along the lines of higher social life, of purer friendship, of higher moral attain ments, of charity and benevolence, which brighten, sweeten and inspire lire. Officers and members of the Grand Temple, Knight Patriarchs, and friends, again we take pleasure in ex tending to you a most cordial welcome to our city, our homes and our friend ship, sincerely hoping that your so journ may be such as to brighten the pages of memory it prints." Sir Knight C. H. Lovewell, Supreme Oracle of the Supreme Lodge of the United States, responded to the toast, "The Supreme Temple," fol lowing the course of the organization from the organization or the first temple in 1880 to the present day. Sir Knight Trueman Hand re snonded to the toast, "The Grand Temple," which is now, for the first time, fully organized. He handled his subject in a very pleasant man ner, predicting a grand future for the order. Sir Knight John M. Grove responded to the toast, "Our Order," in the ab sence of Sir Knight Glenn, who was originally Intended " to respond. Mr. Grove said that the" expression, "Our Order," had a far broader meaning than a personal circled ' Tt was known from ocean to ocean and respected by flf, far and wide.'1 The members are binded "together by honesty,' frater nity and fidelity, a 'very strong chain. Th order", though" yburigf. and'some-wtas-f "stunted 3 by pposltfutv was healthy, and ever ready to establish itself in new communities. We want young men, and we have inducements to oiler them The time is not far distant when our order will extend an influence in this country that will be felt and honored. Sir Knight Henry Gunn responded to the toast, "The Patriarch as a Cit izen." The members of the order, from the Supreme Oracle down, were still members of society. They are drawn from all trades and all profes sions. A man must be a citizen, par excellence, before he can bvcome ft member or the order. The l atrlarch, as a citizen, is interested iu all the affair of life. Sir Knight A. E. Elbe, of Plooming' ton, In responding to the toast, "The Patriarch as a Soldier," said that ho had had no experience in war. Long years ago the world was made up of little bands of patriarchs. Several prominent citizens of La Salle county had led the boys to battle. With them to-night was an old patriarch to whom tne order owed much in Illinois. Sir Knight Lorenzo Leland, respond ing to the toasts, "Our Guests," told a story illustrative of his subject, and remarked that hospitality and a good thrashing were one and the same, as in both it is better to give than to re ceive. E. Y. Griggs Temple felt itself under obligations to its guests, for without them it would have no ban quet. Sir Knight Ridings, of Morris, re sponded to the toast, "The Ladies." He admitted that there were those who could excel him in making a speech, but when it came to respecting the ladies, everybody else was left. When he entered the hall and saw the , ladies his hunger had disappeared and he did not believe he would ever be hungry again. Our lives had been compared to climbing a ladder. The lessons taught are lessons of real worth. Thej have a tendency to make men better and the communities in which men live better. Col. A. H. Height, of Englewood, responded to the toast, "The Golden Hand." The band was an adjunct to the order; recently organized, and should have its proper attention. It was designed for the lad ies, and should . receive their unreserved support. Sir Knight Daniel Evans, respond ing to the toast, "Our Judiciary," said that he was unable to discover what need there might be for judiciary in the order. However, the judge con structed a well-termed response in his most entertaining style. He placed Chief Justice Marshal above all sol diers, having strengthened the one weak spot in the American constitu- " tion by establishing, through judicial decree, the states as dependent upon the government, instead of the gov ment as dependent upon the states. Sir Knight S. T. Anderson, of Hloomington, responded to the toast, "The One's Present." Mr. Anderson remarked that when accepting an in vitation to partake of internal im provements he did not know that he was to toast, but, nevertheless, pre sented his subject in a very pleasing way. Rev. Dr. Gilbert Frederick respond ed to the toast, "The State and Ag gregate of Individual power." The gentleman intimated that he was sleepy (it being somewhat after mid night), and did not care to speak to any great length. Ord never made an independent man, for in unity there is strength. Hancock in the revolution said: "If we don't hang together we will hang separately." Sir Knight C. H. Chapman responded to the toast, "Farewell and Hail." He had been told that the speaking would be short and had prepared a forty-five minute speech, which he would be forced to omit. He bade the guests farewell in a very pleasing manner, paying many well-deserved compli ments to the ladies and the visiting Sir Knights. Willis' orchestra furnished the music, giving a number of excellent selections, among which was an over ture, "The White Elephant," by White. The Oftlcers of the Congregational Church Klected The Pastor's Salary. The members of the First Congre gational Church and the officers held an annual meeting in the church base ment Wednesday evening. The re ports of the different officers for the work of the past year were read and approved. The report of the treas urer, Mr. C. H. Chapman, shows the church to be in first-class condition financially. The officers for the ensuing year were elected as follows: D. It. Snow, President. T. E. Mac Kin lay, Vice-President. James Megaffin, Secretary. C. It. Chapman, Financial Secretary and Treasurer. S. E. King and Hon. Chas. Blan chard, Trustees. The salary of the pastor, Rev. War ren F. Day, was increased to $2,500. He is also given the use of the parson age, in addition to this amount. Next Tuesday evening the pews will be rented, and at 6 o'clock the ladies of the church will serve a supper, to which the public is cordially invited. The O. A. R. Elects Officers. The officers of Seth C. Earl post, G. A. li.. were elected for the ensuine year, at a meeting held last Tuesday evening. Jacob isane, urana txrai mander: Giles Roberts.

Hazel were appointed as delegates to the Department encampment to be held in Quincy some time next month. The newly elected officers will bo installed at a meeting held on the Arts Tuesdayin January. Tbe boys expect that Wm. Burgess, the retir ing commander, will tender them a banquet at which hard tack will form the principal portion of the menu. The Clover Club held a meeting Wednesday evening to take action in securing the National Irish Comedy Company as a special attraction at the opera house in the near future. Mr. Flaherty, the advance agent for the Company, made a proposition and the club have the matter under, advisement.
