Three matters of capital importance await the action of the sciiale which have already I n acted upon by the liotise nf representatives: the bill which seeks to extend gl let' freedom ol cnmbitiutinii lii those engaged in pro moting the foreign commerce of the couniry than Is now thought bv sonic to be legal under the terms of the laws against nuunipnly; Hie hill amending the present organic law of I'orio Kieo : and Hie bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elect Ions, com monly called Hie ( 'orrilpl Practices Act. ( need not labor my advice that these measures be enaeled into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest circum stances which r Icr their adoption at mis nine noi omy opportune but neces sary, Kvcii delay would seriously jeopard the interests of the country ami of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulalc the expenditure of money in elec tinhs may seem to be less accessary Hcin the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral olliees arc to be (illed : bill it would greatly relieve the public mind if this Iniportnnt matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent lui'tliod of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can lie frankly studied in the light of present experience; and n delay would have the further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand and some slecial object connected with It might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged It. Action can lie taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer, hand in the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our e.vMirt trade.

The argument fur the proposed unicnilineiits of Hie organic law of I'or io liico is brief nml conclusive. Tln; prescnt laws governing the Island and regulating the rights mid privileges of its people are not Just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There Is uneasiness among the people of the Island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our inlenllons concerning them which the adoption of Hie pending measure would happily re move. We do imt doubt what we wish lo do In nny essential particular. We might to do it at mice There are other matters already ad vanced lo the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it Is not necessary tlmt I sliould speak. Sonic practicable basis of agreement concerning Ibeni will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen, prob ably the lust occasion I shall have to address Hie Sixty-fourth congress, I hope Ihal you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction 1 have co-operated with you In the tunny measures of constructive pul ley with which you have enriched the legislative annuls of Hie cnunlry. It has been a privilege lo labor in such company. I lake the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare scrviccablcness and distinction. Bound to Make Good.

Then the deaf man got up and told the same story (he other man bad told. He Was on the Job. The undertaker arose and said to the mourners assembled: "If anyone present wishes to sny a few words of tribute to the deceased, now Is (lie time, when the family will lie Rind to hear such." A stillness prevailed, and after a few moments of silence it was broken by n young man, who arose and asked : "to I understand that no one wishes to make any remarks?" "It would appear so," replied the undertaker.
