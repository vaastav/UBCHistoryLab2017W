Chicago, Dec. 5-A maddened bull that had escaped from his keepers while being driven from the judges' ring today at the Livetsock exposition caused a panic among the several thousand spectators who were witnes sing the heavy team exhibition in Dex ter avenue, just west of the pavilion. When the animal gained his freedom he lowered his head and made straight for the crowd. Shouts from a score of men warned those in peril, but in the wild scramble for safety three men and a little girl were unable to get out of the way and were thrown to the ground by the bull. No one was ser iously injured, ho~ ever, and the bull was captured by cowboys. The exposition had several promi nent visitors, among whom were Anthony De Travasky, imperial chan cellor and royal Hungarian commis sioner of agriculture, stationed at Washington, and Governor J. Hoge Tyler of Virginia. The Europeans expressed themselves as surprised at the extent and variety, of the exposition.

They will report to their home government and the result may be the introduction of Ameirlau bred strains.

Boston, Dec. 5-Another southern storm has swept over New England and gone the way of all such distur bances, straight off to the northeast, and like hundreds of its energetic pre decessors, left death and destruction in its wake. It followed the European steamer track, so that its destructive history is not yet comFlete. Just what it accomplished in this line in New England and particularly along the coast north of Boston can be summed up as follows: Five Glou cester fishermen drowned, six coasting schoonesr ashore, and 11 others more or less injured through collision and loss of gear. The usual amount of damage oc curred on the land, buildings being blown down, telegraph wires prostrat ed and some delays on the railroads in the northern portion' through heavy snows. It is generally believed that incom ing vessels will add something more to the storm. LOSS BY FIRE.

C0LOSE CALL FROM DEATH 0; MINERS IMPRISONED BENEATH S' THE EARTH. r FIERCE BATTLE FOR LIFE Coolness of Foreman Enables Men to Escape Awful Fate That It Threatened Them. e Scranton, Dec. 5-Imprisoned 1,000 e feet in a colliery at Dunmuir, near here, 32 men had a desperate battle r for life today as a result of a mine e cave-in and only succeeded in obtaining v their liberty by digging their way out. The cave-in was in the mine of the Nayaug Coal company. Five acrps of surface fell into the mine and corn pletely blocked the exit. A rescuing party was formed, but the imprisoned men cut their way out through the fall before the men in the rescuing party reached them. None of the men was injured. The men were all at work about 1,000 feet from the bottom of the slope and 400 feet below the surface when two acres of the roof between them and the slope came down with a ter rible crash, crushing the pillars be neath it and causing a rush of air that almost blew the men from their feet and hurled the roof off the house. Their lamps were extinguished, but finding that the air was still pure, they relighted them and began to cast about for a way to escape. Foreman John Gibbons bade the men keep cool. Crawling on hris hands and knees he made his way to within 15 feet of an air way which led to the second open ing and which, he presumed, was not effected by the fall,. as it is a narrow passage cut through solid rock. Returning for the men he had them take their tools and follow him. After a difficult and dangerous jcwr ney they reached the point where the fall blocked their way. This was at tacked with bars and picksand shovels and after an hour's work a passage was cleared to the air way, which, as. they had counted upon, was open. As fast as they could run they made their way to the second opening and thence to the surface where they were greeted with wild hurrahs from the thousands who had gathered expecting to see them brought out crushed and man gled corpses, if they were breught out at all.
