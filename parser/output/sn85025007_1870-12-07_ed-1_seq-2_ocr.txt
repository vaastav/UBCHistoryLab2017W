' i % j : -<y> | ALEXMDR1A, VA WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1870. European News.?Advices by balloon from Paris up.to Sunday state that on Friday the Prussians attacked the positions of Gen. Pucrot on tha southeastern side of Paris, but were defeated, after S3ven hours hard fight iog, and retreated. The French then retired across the Memo and took up positions nearer Paris. The Prussian loss wa9 put do\?D at 15.000 to 20,000, but this is, probably, an exaggeration. King William, on Sunday night, telegraphed the Queen of Prussia some particulars of the successes of the army of the Duke of Mecklenburg,after two days' fighting, which resulted in the capture of St. Jean rail way station and a suburb of Orleans, with thirty guns and 1,000 prisoners. A dispatch from Havre states that there is no conomunica lion with the interior of France, and there being but one Atlantic cable at work, transmission of dispatches is necessarily slow. It is the habit of some of the Radical papers, when speaking of those opposed to Radicalism, when aoting at an election, and voting their political sentiments, to talk of the "rebel element." What an immense rebel element there must be in the country 1 The Washington Chronicle says, iu reference to Admiral Porter's letter, "that Gen. Grant, the party most aggrieved, does not propose to punish a brave officer for an indiscretion which has been fully and raantully regretted." Tho comments of the newspapers on the President's Message, are as various as thepnb lie journals themselves?Radicals praise it; Democrats and Conservatives object to portions of it, and express their dissent. ' ft rxt' ll, A lAtAD iiie newspapers give uccjuuioui u>g mui view between the President and Admiral Porter, and of the admission of the latter that he wrote the now famous letter. Friends have interposed to effect a reconciliation. On last Saturday a train of nineteen care, laden with tea, direct from San Francisco, passed through Harrisburg, Pa., on the way to New York. The cargo, it is stated, is worth ue9r $300,0<X>. At a meeting of the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of Washington, held last evening, the by laws were amended to admit women to membership. The Canada papers are very ''indignant" at that portion ol (he President's Message which refers to the Canadian authorities. At the WashiDgtou Navy Yard, yesterday, a dredging machine which cost the Government $20,000 was sold for $3,37.0. At the muuicipal election in Mobile, Ala., yesterday, the D?mocraiio majority was over i,000. ^ At the last dates from St. Douiiugo, public affairs there seemed to be in great confusion.

Bowen, from the Second South Carolina district, is ready for the work of the com ng session. In regard to the election of De Large, his opponent in the recent canvass, he states that already eight out of twelve Commissioners oi Election in the counties of Charleston, Colleton, Barnwell and Beaufort, comprising Lis district, have been indicted for tampering with the votes entrusted to their care. In one voting precinct there arc over 200 men ready to swear that they voted for v* mmo CkamOii AH It* 

OUWCU, WIJISC 1UC UUlblOl UIUIUO cawr.fj vi..j fourteen votes cast for Mr. Bowen. With but few exceptions it is claimed that the managers as well as the Commissioners of Election were interested parties, being candidates for Stato and local officers od the Scott ticket. IVIr. Bowen will not only contest the election ol i)e Large, but says he will show by sworn statements that tbo official returns were made to suit the interest ol his opponent, without reference to the actual number of rotes cast. He will not only claim his seat in the Forty second Congress, but will prosecute every man in 1 tais district who participated in the election j frauds. Senator Sawyer, of South Carolina, who has been suffering for some time past with a complication of diseases, gives a discouraging account ol the prospects of the republican party in his State, xle substantiates the chaiges made of fraud in the Second district at the last election, and says that in Borne ol the voting preoincts the women actually votes a& the representatives of their absent husbands. The manner in which the last Stato election in South Carolina is represented to have been held exceeds anything in the way of elcotions. Court of Appeals.?On Saturday last Judge Christian, lor a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court ot Appeals, announced that the Court would not havo judgment entered at this term in the oase recently deoided, involving the constitutionality of the enabling act. It will be remembered that the case of Griffin's executors vs. Cunningham and "'--i.:?i - - n 1 1 a i J i f* BBUiugiuu, VTCurgetuwu auu /xioaauutia i?uiroad compauy, brought up the question of the constitutionality of so much ot the enabling act 89 allowed the present court to review the decisions of their military predecessors, and that it wasdecided that part of the act authorizing the review was unconstitutional. Mr. Conway Robinson, though not couo-el in this case, suggested that they would hear further argument, and cited several cases where such a thing had been done, and in some instances the opinion of the court so much changed as to cause tbem to reverse their previous con elusions. On this suggestion and a similar one made by James LyoDS, Esq., the court determined to defer entering judgment until they reassembled heroin January, rIhey will in the meantime, be glad to hear written or printed arguments submitted 10 them.?JiicJt.

It appeared from the testimony of a Professor Silliman that tho artiole sold as port ti wine contained forty five grains to the gallon r of oxide of lead, and the whisky fifty grains of I lead to tho gallon. Tho fact stood forth in * mitigation that defendant did not know tho ri character of the liquors he sold ; but tho court g decided that his offence was of such grave do i scription that it would have to be punished pi with sufficient severity to call the attention of n all who are selling liquors contrary to law, to d tho periis they incur it the liquors they sell arc n impure and poisonous.
