The Constitution will remain as it is, or the Union1 will be dissolved. You want facts. Here they are. :: -. I HOW 

CONGRESSMEN TALK. Senator Trumbull will not' confess that secession is likely, excep'tirig per haps in the case ot couth Carolina, sh? being lunatic, and therefore an excep tion to all laws. He says there is a flurry, but it will blow over. Senator Wade, recognizes the facts, is ready to treat them as facts, and says the North has nothing to -jdo but proceed as "she ev&t-has. Senator Seward's position is in-dispute. The- logic of his career 4ias a duplex interpretation. One party says he will yield too much to the South' notwithstanding, . his- .-"irrepressible'' speeches. Thurlow Weed's recessive articles confirm this impression, because his intimacy with Seward seems to indi cate that they are acting in concept, and. that the utterances ot the Albany hvca ing -Journal are the echoes of Seward's views. Another party vigorously denies Seward's complicity with Weed's recess ion, and contend that he will,.as usual, lead the Republicans in the line of rigid principle. But a general "impression obtains that he will assume the role of pacificator. Sunnier will remain quiet until the Republicans agree generally to define. But all of the Republicans are for the Union as it is. Whilcr alt of them would readily consent, to the re peal of Northern Personal Liberty laws, if the South will ' first withdraw her challenge, not one, no! not one of them, flinches from the Republican doctrine against extension of slavery into terri tories. But mark again they seem unanimous against Gmyressional legisla tion on the subject.of slavery respecting the teiTilorie.s. They are content to abide the natural laws of labor, to work 'out the. great anti-slavery principle,' and they are falling flat on Governor Chase's idea of Popular Sovereignty. Now for Southern gentlemen. Sena tor Hemphill of Texas, is strong for the Union., His. .colleague, . Wingfa'il,', is plump against it. Mason . of Virginia, is a secessionist- . His- great colleague-, Hunter, is rather for the Union,; and tremendous efforts are making by Vir ginia planters to make him altogether for the Union. The Maryland Senators are for the Union, but they are em barrassed by the attitude of the Balti moreans. Here, by-the-bye, I am re minded of a new element which is likely to be brought to bear in behalf of the Union fight. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad interests are deeply involved, and at the proper time, it is suggested that corporation will eng ige in , the struggle. Johnston of Tennessee, is, set down for the Union. The position of Senator Powell of Kentucky, has not been the subject of discussion. He will probably be for tho Union, while Mr. Breckinridge is. Jliverybody kuows where the Mississippi Senators stand. Clingman of N. C. is slightly for secess ion. Green and Po'k, of Missouri, are for the Union, and so are the Itepresen tatives from that State. All the Ken tucky and Tennessee Representatives, I believe, are on the same side. - Hill of Georgia, talks earnestly for the Union. The political and pecuniary salvation of Bctilec (ol Va.) and his people, place him on the side of the Union. DOUGLAS CRITTENDEN. Douglas and his frieuds, like all the Republicans, are clamorous for , the. Union.. ' It is said Douglas will assume the role of champion for the Union. His partisans do not deny that it w al together likely that they will some day. hot far distant, be '-true yoke fellows for the Union with both Republicans and Americans a spectacle whieh-will demonstrate that "politics makes strange bed-fellows." Crittenden is eloquent for Union, and he "made a noble speech of(twenty minutes yesterday for the whole country as it is. But as this ball rolls on, I shall give you the current fluctuations. If to-day it looks blue, and to-morrow is reported fair, weather, the apparent contradiction must not be charged to the correspon dent. Each day must answer for itself, and revolutions of feeling and hopes will be, recorded as outcroppings from the peculiar influences in operation. No "tricks of tho trade" shall be prac ticed in such dangerous times, for the facts' are sensational enough without coloring. ' ' - ; Washington, Dec. 7. " . Congress being adjourned, the people have an opportunity to brood over the gloomy aspect of the political horizon. This does not mend matters. It affords Secessionists an opportunity to demoral ize Border Union men, and they make the most of their advantages. In addi tion to the bid against opening the slave trade, they protest that the Mississippi J river will remain an obstructed channel to the States. Green, ot Missouri, hith erto ranked with Union men, has shutV fled tiff toward secession. Meantime, Northern men are closing ranks to meet the shock, and there arc indications that it Till cmfi nxt wefk. Seward, Corwin, Sherman, Wade, all the Republicans. Douglas and his friend?, assume boldy that the idea of the llight ot secession snau never me admitted in any event, and men of stamina take luded with the chimera that, if Govern n,ent attempt to coerce the South, revo lutioii will ensue in New York and other Northern cities ; but are surprised at the firm demeanor of" Republicans. They begin to manifest serious anxiety to know whether the North" will meet the shpek bravely. t There seems yet to be no traitors in the iNorth. . - . .Somo think there will be nodisoxder; ly scenes iu Congress, this winter.

The revenues will be collected at the various ports, and the mails will be run under protest, while the Border States will .remain to meditate with the North. The debate in the Senate on Mr. Pow ell' resolution foffa Committee of Thir teen, had a reasssuring erTect. Southern Senators spoke of the' Union as strong, notwithstanding the severe shoak it has received; and if moderate council prevail it may be preserved. " Ih tbe House nothing of importance occurred. There was a short debate on the proposition to excuse Mr. Hawkins of Florida, from serving on the commit tee of. thirty-three, but the time was in great part occupied by such men as Sickles and Vallandigham. Mr. M'Cler nand of Illinois, made a few remarks, which were well received. The vote was not reached. Secretary Cobb has resigned the po sition of Secretary of the Treasury. This is favorable for the Union men. Mr. Holt will probably be his successor. The ehanire will bo for the better. The President has again refused to send additional troops to Fort Moultrie. The South Carolina delegation Had an interview with the President to-day, to arrange about the position of the forts, -when the State shall secede. Corwin and Kellogg have a proposi tion ready to submit to the Committee of Thirty-three, looking to a general Convention of all the States - Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet is under con sideration. Judd is here from Illinois, tfnd Trumbull has gone to New York to consult the leaders there. Index. Pardoned. j On Tuesday week, says the Columbus Journal, the Governor granted a pardon ta a young man bythc name of Adam lleckerthorn, who waa sentenced to the Penitentiary-for life, on the following conditions: That he shall go directly from the Penitentiary to the residence of Adam A. Treat, in Geauga, Medina county, and obey his directions in all respects, until the said Treat shall cer tify to the Governor, in writing, that in his opinion it will be safe to the commu nity for the said lleckerthorn to provide for himself in his own way. lleckerthorn was convicted for the crime of murder, on the 28th of Novem ber, 18-43, in Williams county, and was sentenced to be executed on the April following, but by tho strenuous efforts of the judge before whom he was tried, and others, the sentence was commuted by Governor Ford to imprisonment in the Penitentiary for life. He was a mere lad, about 16 years of age, and was led into the crime by one-John Tyler, a very bad man. He waa represented to be a boy of weak intellect, but a few degrees t removed from idiocy, and that he was totally incapable oi distinguish ing 'right from wrong. .. ..... 1 1 .. - . ... v J. yiur was u visiuiiui j man, pc- tended to be a conjurer, and induced this boy to abduct a'childy aTlltleboy by the name of Schamp, from, his' parents, and after h took him to the Woods he killed ' i i i. j in nim ana sccreieu ine ooay iu a uuuow tree, ior the purpose ot extorting money from the parents by telling them where the child was, and thus establish his fame as a conjurer, so that he could dupe others by his necromancy. Tyler was tried and convicted, and, we believe, executed at the time. Bj3k,Se,e Delinquent.

Headaches may bo classified under two names: viz Symptomatic' and Idiopathic. Symptomatic Headache is exceedingly common and is the precursor of a "great variety of diseases, amou; which Me Apoplexy, Gout, l!hoiimaji3m and all febrilo diseases. In its nervous form it is sympathetic 6f disease of the stomach'- constituting tick headache, of hepatic uiscuau wuiiMiuug uutuux ncuuacne, 01 worms, constipation and other disorders of the bowels, ns well as renal and uterine affections.' Diseases of the heart" are vey frequently atl ended wit.li Headaches ; A me una and plethora are also af feotions which frequently occasion headache. Idiopathic Headache is also very common,'bcing usually distinguished by the name of nerv'us headache, sometimes cwnin'g' on' Suddenly in a state of apparently sound health,' and prostra ting at once the mental and physical energies. anu . ia uiuer instances ic comes on slowly, hcaralded by depression of spirits or acerbity of temper, in most instances the-pain is in the front of the head, over one or both eyes, and sometimes provoking vomiting; under this class may also be named Neuraltiia. ' ' Fdr the treatment of either class of Headache 'the Cephalic l'ills have- been found a Sure and safe remedy, relieving the most acute pains in a few minutes and by its subtle power eradi caling the diseases of which, Headache 'is the unerring index . - Bridget.

Xo one of the " many ills flesh is heir to-' is so prevalent, ao little understood, and so much neglopted as Costiveness. Often originating in carelessness, or sedentary habits ; it is regarded as a slight disorder 6f too little consequence to excite anxiety, while in reality it is the pre cursor and companion "of many of the most fatal and dangerous diseases,' and unless early eradicated it will bring the sufferer to an un timely grave. Among the lighter evils of which costiveness is the .usual attendant are Headache, Colic, .Rheumatism, Foul Breath, Piles and others of like nature, while a lone t'n of frightful diseases Such as Malignaut ! Fevers' .Abeesses , liyscutarv, Hiarrhoja, Dys- i nfnwi;i -AiioTilprv l-.m 1itc v P;ir.ilri Hi'Qtoi'ifi Hypochondriasis, Jlolanclioly and Insanity, first iudie tie their presence in the svsteitt by this alarming symptom. Not. unfT-equcntly the diseases named originate in Constipation, but take on an iudepomlent existence unless ' the cause is eradicated in an early stage. From all these conditions it follows that the disorder should receive'' immediate attention whouever it occurs, ami no person should neglect to get a box of Cephalic l'ills on the first appearance ot tlie complaint, as their timely use will expel the iusiduous approaches of disease and destroy this dangerous too to hum.in lite.

Mr Spalding has sold two millions of bottles of his celebrated Prepared Glue and it is estimated that each bottle saves at least, teu dollars worth of broken furniture, thus makiii": an aggregate of twenty millions of dollars reclaimed from to tal loss by this valuable invention. . Having made his Glue a household word, he now pro poses to do the world still greater service by c iritig all the aching heads with his Cephalic l'ills, and if they are as good as his Glue, Headaches will soon vanish away like snow iu July. : XSSOvEit excitement, and the mental care and anxiety incident to close attention tobusi ness or study, are among the numerous causes ot Nervous Headache, the disordered state o! mind and liody incident to this distressing com plaint, is ft fatal blow to all energy and ambi tion. Sufferers by this disorder can always obtain speedy relief from these distressing at tacks by using one of the Cephalic I ills, when ever the symptoms appear. . It quiets the over tasked brain, and soothes, the strained, and jarring nerves, and relaxes thetension ot tut stomach which always. accompanies and aggra vates the disordered condition of the brain. - CURE NervousHeadache By the use of tliosi Pills the perio'lin attacks of Xervousor Sick H ladache" mny be prevented; and If lakuunt the coimn-mcmv ntof an attack, iinm" diate relief rrom pain and sickness will bt obtaiuett.
