VOLUME XIV.- NUMBER 50. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Fellow-Citizens of the Senate And House of Representatives : Sinco your last annual assembling, an other year of wealth and bountiful har vests has passed; and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guid ed by the light He gives us, trusting that in His own good time aud way, all will be well. The correspondence touching foreign affairs, has taken place during the last year, is herewith eubuiitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect, made by tho House of Representatives, •near tho close of the last session of Con gress. If the coudition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a na tion so uuhappily distressed as we are might reasonably have apprehended. Iu the month of June last, there were some grounds to expect that the maritime Dow ers, which at the beginuing of our do mestic difficulties, so unanimously and unnecessarily,. as we think, recognized tho insurgents as a belligereut, would soon recede from that position, which lias proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country ; but the tempo rary reverses which afterward befell the national arms, and which wore exaggerat ed by our own disloyal children abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice. The civil war which lias so radically changed for the moment the occupations aud habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social conditions and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried oil a commerce, that has been steadily in creasing throughout a period of half a century. It has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions, which have profound agitation through out the civilized world. In this unusual agitation, we have fotb*rnc from taking part iu any controversy between foreign States aud between parties or factions in such States. We have attempted no pro pagandist!! and acknowledged rio revolu tion. But we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct aiul management of its own affairs. ()ur struggle has beeu, of course, contemplated by foreign na tions with reference less to its own mer its than to its supposed and often exag gyrated effects, and the consequence re sulting to those nations themselves. — Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this Government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave-trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowl edge that the execution of it on the part of her Majesty's Government has been marked by a jealous respect for tho au thority of the United States and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The Convention with Hanover for the abolition of the Stade dues has been car ried into full effect under the act of Con gress for that purpose. A blockade of 3,000 miles of sea-coast couid not bo established aud vigorously enforced in a sfcasou of great commercial activity like the present without commit ting occasional mistakes and inflicting n C unintentional injuries upon foreign na tions and their subjects. A civil war oc curring in a country where foreigners re side and carry on trade, under treaty stip ulations, is necessarily fruitful of com plaints of tho violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite mis apprehensions, and possibly, to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in pre serving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds, I have, so far as pos sible, heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly Dowers. There is, however, a large and augmenting number of doubtful cases, upon which tho Government is unable to agree with the Governments whose pro- j tcction is demanded by the claimants.— There arc, moreover, many cases in which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from tho naval or military au thorities of foreign nations, which the Governments of these States are not at once prepared to redress. I have pro posed to some of tho foreign States thus interested, mutual conventions to exam ine and adjust such complaints. This proposition lias been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Drussia. Iu each case, it has been for mally adopted. I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian Bark Ad-j rniral P. Fordens Riola, which vessel was, in May, 1861, prevented by the comman der of the blocading force off Charleston iiojn leaving that port with cargo, not withstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an English vessel. 1 have direoted the Secretary of State to cause the papers iu the case to be communicated to tho proper commit tees. Applications have been made to mc by many free Americans of African descent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad, some from interested motives, others upon patriotic considera tions, and still others induced by philan thropic sentiments, have suggested simi lar measures ; while on the other hand, several of the Spanish American Repub lics have protested against sending of such colonies to their respective territories.— Under these circumstances, I have de clined to mcve any such colony to any State without first obtaining the consent of its Government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emi grants in all their rights as freemen, and I have at the same time offered to the several States situated in the tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emi gration of persons of that class to their respective territories upon conditions which shall be equal, just and humane. Liberia aud Ilayti are as yet the only countries to whioh colonists of African descent from hero could go and with cer tainty of being received and adopted as citizens, and I regret to say that such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to emigrate to those coun tries as to some others, nor so willing as 1 think their interest demands. I be live, however the opinion among tliem in this respect is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and con siderable emigration to both these coun tries from the United States. The new commercial treaty betweon the United States and the Sultan of Tur key has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's cou sent, with Liberia, and a similar negotia tion is now pending with the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the national coinmereo is expected to re sult from these measure's. Oiy relations with great Britain, France, Spain, Portu gal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European States, remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also oontinua to be maintained with Tur key, Morocco, China and Japan. During tho last year, there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent States of our own continent, but more friendly scutiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be en tertained by these neighbors, whose safe ty and progress are 60 intimately connect ed with our own. This statement spe cially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Nic aragua. Honduras, Peru and Chili. The Commission under the Convention with the Republic of New Granada closed its session without having audited and passed upon all tho claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the Convention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The Commis sion between tho United States and the Republic of Costo Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. I have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europo by an Atlan tic Telegraph, and a similar project to ex tend the telegraph from San Francisco, 1 to connect by a Pacific Telegraph with the wire which is "being extended across the Russian Empire. The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have re mained undisturbed by the civil war, and they are exhibiting such evidence of pros perity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to bo organized as States, and bo consti tutionally admitted into the Union.— The immense mineral resources of some ; of these Territories ought to be develop ed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendeney to disprove the revenues of the Government, and diminish tho burdens of tho people. I It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to' promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely j to be effective, is a scientific exploration | of tho mineral regions in these territories with a view to the publication of its re sults at homo and in foreign countries, results which cannot fail to bo auspi cious. The condition of the finanoes will claim your most dilligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to the milita ry and naval operations required for the suppression of the Rebellion have hither to been met with a promptitude and cer tainly unusul in similar circumstances, and the public oredit has been fully main tained. The continuance of the war, how ever, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflec tions as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenues without injury to business, and with the least possible bur- to tije of Jh[C qijd ty* IRssetyuiqtiop of s#oh}lity, JLiletqiijlre qpd setog.
