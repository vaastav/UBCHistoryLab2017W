NEW YORK. Dec. 3. The Memphis gold cup dispute was officially ended tonight when the board of review of the National Trotting Association de cided that the trophy had been won on merit and dismissed the charges against E. E. Smathers. The case. which was taken up by the board at the continuation of Its winter meeting today, grew out of the drugging of Lou Dillon at the Memphis meeting In Oc tober, 1904. Smathers, who owned Major Del mar and drove him in the race, was charged with having been cognizant ot the. 111 treatment of C. K. G. Bill ings' mare, Xou Dillon, which resulted in the latters utter failure to show form in the race and the winning of the $5000 gold cup by Major Delmar. George W. Speer was a most damag ing witness against Smathers. He had sworn that Smathers had request ed him to open negotiations with Saunders as to whether Lou Dillon could not be "fixed." Speer said that' Saunders offered to do the Job for $10,000. but Smathers thought that too much and told him to drop It. The de fense Droduced witnesses who de clared that Speers' character "was bad. At the conclusion of the nearmg John S. Wise, counsel for Smathers, made a bitter arraignment of the men who had nrocured charges against his client, mentioning particularly C. K. O. Billings, owner or Lou union, ana Murray Howe, secretary of the Mem phis Trotting Association. "I feel that we have suffered long and pa tiently and bitterly," said Mr. Wise. "The charges are absolutely unsus talned. And as to Billings and Howe that Is a matter for further develop ment which later we will take under consideration." The case went to the board in executive session, -which lasted hardly quarter of an hour. o GOVERNOR OF TEXAS MAKES APPOINTMENTS. SAN ANTONIO, Texv Dec. 5.
