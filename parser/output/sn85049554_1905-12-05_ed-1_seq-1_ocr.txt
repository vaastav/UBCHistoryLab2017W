MOODY ON RATE FIXING. Attorney General Favors Remedying the Rebate Evil. Washington^ Dec. 5.—Attorney Gen eral Moody's annual report to congress, submitted Monday, deals fully and clearly with the railroad question, and suggests remedies along lines that President Roosevelt favors. Mr. Moody would add imprisonment as an alternative punishment for vio lation of the Elkins law, which now only Imposes fines. The great difficulty "Officials of rail- every waV in enforcing the provisions of the law against rebates, discriminations and departures from published rates," says the attorney general with a touch1of sarcasm, "but have declined to render the only assis tance that would be of the slightest value, namely, the furnishing of evi dence proving the offense." The department Is willing to accept the evidence of either party to a viola tion of the law in efforts to punish the other party, and offers freed'om from prosecution as an inducement for such evidence, but, the report says, offenders shrink from betraying their confeder ates. Rate Remedy Suggested. Mr. Moody sets forth his rate remedy for present conditions in the follow ing: "If the power, upon complaint, to fix a future maximum rate and put it into effect within a reasonable time, subject to appeal to the courts, should be given to some administrative body cheated by congress, a weapon against discrimin atory practices, m.-ch more potent than any now available, would be put into the hands of the government. Upon proof that a lower rate had been given to some preferred shipper, the body clothed with the power to fix a future maximum rate mipht well determine that the rate which the railroad could afford to give to the preferred shipper it could afford to give to all shippers In like situation. Such a finding, it could be predicted with certainty, the courts upon appeal would not reverse, for no better evidence of the legality and jus tice of the rate thus fixed could be fournd than In the action of the carrier Itself. It would be difficult for the carrier to maintain that a rate actually charged by it was confiscatory or un just." To Raise Another Million.

Eldredge said a brother or cousin of Hoffecker in Delaware organized the policyholders and that "One McDon ald" in Philadelphia and Hoffecker in New York were active in the move ment of the policyholders which threatened a move against the man agement of the Mutual Reserve and to secure appointment of a receiver for the company. "It was in the nature of extortion, said Eldiredige, but we had to consider expense and interest of policyholders. We chose the lesser of two evils." Eldredge said the charges especially were directed against Burn ham on account of large advances to Morse. Eldredge said the Mutual Re serve paid $15,000 to McDonald to set tle the agitation.

Bar rett believes that the state should do more to entourage the taking of ex aminations for life teaching diplomas. There were six took the examination last we'tk before the state boitd of ed ucational examiners. "You will find that was a large class if you will look back thru the records," said Mr. Bar rett, while in the city the other day. "I think while I was in the office the largest class was four. Teachers do not take examinations for life certifi cates for the reason that their positions are but for the year and the only sav ing they make by taking the examina tion is the saving of the annoyance of having to take the examination each year. They get no better positions .by having life diplomas and are no more secure in their positions. The state should give school boards authority tc contract with teachers for more than one year whin the teacher has a life certificate. This would tend ,to keep teachers in the profession and the state should do all it can to encourage per sons to remain in the profession of teaching." ... T. D. Long of Manson has written to State Superintendent John F. Riggs suggesting that While the law to have all teachers' licenses given by the stata and good in every county is a good one and worthy of all commendation, he believes there should be another law revoking a license when a teacher breaks a contract with a school board. Mr. Long has been in the position of school director for many years and says it has been his experience that every year there are a number of teachers who break their agreement at the last minute and leave the directors to find another teacher as best they may. He believes t'his is a detriment to the public schools and should be stopped and believes if whenever a showing is made that a contract has been broken by a teacher and the license was revoked toy the state superinten dent, teachers would be slower about breaking such contracts. The state superintendent has never done .more than to use moral persuasion to keep teachers from breaking their contracts, but while educators believe such a law would have a good effect and possibly one that is needed, It is not likely that such a measure will be taken up for the reason that educators are anxious to get the bill for state certificates thru and do not care to hazard tht measure by tacking on any others., /, State Insurance Commissioner E. M. Host, of Wisconsin, was in the city yesterday. Mr. Host believes little will be done by the Wisconsin legislature on the matter of insurance. There was an investigation of the Northwestern Mutual of Milwaukee and everything was found to be in good shape. Ho believes that the legislature will more especially investigate railroads and other corporations rather than the in surance companies of the state......... There will be meetings of the board of trustees of the'State Normal at Cedar Falis, December 12, and of the board of trustees of t'he State College at Ames, December 14. State Superin tendent RiRgs will be unable to attend because of other engagements and the work of the office in getting out the biennial report. Tt Is the belief of a number that th order of postmaster general taking fourth class postoffices out of politics and leaving the occupants of the offi ces in as long as the service is satis factory will work somewhat of a change In the politics of some districts of this state. The fourth class postoffices are numerous In this state. They are faf V, I •7 more numerous .£? any other kind. There are only a' 300 offices in the state that are a the fourth class. Down in the ei- district in Adams county there is Cr office in the coun ty above the 1 j* th class and that is at Corning. 7 Jlarke there are two, one at Murra rwi one at Osceola, in Lucas two, £r it Chariton and one at Russell artr Union three at Afton, Croston ar.-""" Lorimer. Congressman Hepburn is said-to have a postmasters machine, and has been accused of keeping strong with the people by ap pointing editors as postmasters and thus getting the support of the news papers. Other counties of Iowa have about the same proportion of fourth class offices as the counties named. The application of J. J. Payne, of this city, for the position of city clerk is in line with the prophecy given a few days ago that grave questions are still to be determined in regard to the old soldiers preferepce law. The law is very short and very sweeping and gives not a great deal ini detail. In the case in this city of Mr. Payne applying to the city council for the position of city clerk, he states specifically that he "demands" the position under the old soldiers preference law. The city council has filled the position and one of the questions under the law to be determined is whether applications for positions must be confined to places where there is a vacancy or one about to occur. The city council has ap pointed a man not an old soldier and, he has been serving since appointed. If lie is discharged and an old soldier put in his place, will the council not be lia ble to damages to the civilian for wages till the end of his term. The law could hardly hold the council li able to the both ways to the civilian if the old soldier is put in and to the old soldier if he is not put in. The question naturally arises, can an old soldier demand preference at any time he chooses to ask for an office or must, he wait till the term expires and fur thermore can an old soldier holding an office still demand the office of the next man having the appointing pow er after the term expired as against other old soldiers. It Is probable that cases will have to be carried to the su preme court before these matters are all determined. v" -tt 1J DISASTER IN LONDON '-ite One End of the Immense Roof Over Charing Cross Station, Collapses Many Dead Among the Ruina, and Large Number In Critical Condition at Hospital.

[Oskaloosa Tribune[ It used to be part of the business of the world of educators to stimu late flagging students by a reference to the money value of an education. It was all very well ten years ago to tell a class that the uneducated labor ers earned $1.50 per day while the high school graduate could earn ten in the same time. But in view of late developments in high places such advice Is untimely now. It is doubtful If it was ever wise to hold out these ideas exclusively to the young, and perhaps we are reap ing the results now. Every young man on leaving school begins to measure his ability, not by the ex cellence of his work, but by the money he gets for it. The doctrine has been "get money," "get money," "get money." By getting it you will shine as a man of virtue, ability and patriotism. We are reaping the harvest. A sense of common business honesty seems to be lacking among our high financiers. Selfishness rules the world of business. Gratitude and truth are things unknown. If education and earning good wages mean this, let us do away with them. The one object of all education is the making of better men and better America? asksj^ H.^K Carroll citizens, and no man dares claim, in the light of late investigations, that our high financiers are either good men or good citizens. The honest hardi working street laborer of our town is today a far better man and a more useful citizen than George W. Perkins, Morgan's right hand man. Education does not mean cultivated everywhere the church of the classes selfishness systematized greed. It and the masses but nowhere does it means how much can you do for the seem to have any world arouiid you.' It means service and growth, not dollars and cents. TRIALS OF A TRUANT OFFICER.

GETTING TRUE VALUE. [Mason City Times-Herald] An interesting fact in connection with the recent arrest of a fugitive from justice is t'he statement that the man had embezzle! $5,000, and the county in which the crime was com mitted expended $40,000 in apprehend-, ing him. The tone of the dispatch contain in? this bit of information is sum as to lead the readier to feel that a sug gestion is being made of the fit'lity of expending so great a sum in ,ord.r to punsh a comparatively insignificant wrong. But few persons will be Inclined to to accept that view of the matter. No truer exemplification of the real majesty of law could be given than this one occurrence. It proves on the very face of it, that the lesson of obedience to legal statutes is .hell to be of higher importance than the se ct ring of restitution for a trespass of la iv. It cannot be doul ted that In th* community where this object Ie?!cn vs been offered a more wmes'ime respect for law will follow in the fu ture than has ever been know in the past.
