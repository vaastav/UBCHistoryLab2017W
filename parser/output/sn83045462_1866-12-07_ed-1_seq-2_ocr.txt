Chmnicte. It",-* <? R'y^bluan 4,791 SUICIDAL POLICY. C?ne year ago a great many farmer* and small capitalist? (including a number of discharged officers and soldiers) from the Northern and Middle State*. were passing through ibis city on their way to the neighboring counties of \ irginia for tbe purpose of buying small farms and engaging in agriculture. A few ouly made purchases, some bought and sold azaia. and others returned home or departed tor'be West and now not one of this enterprising ar.d mrinstriou- class is looking for a chance to settle in the Old Dominion, where formerly there wrre a hundred. Several causes bare operated to produce this re-ult A tew have been frightened off by the continued unsettled condition of national affair*, but tbe great majority have fonnd the principal obstacles to their settlement ?ai Virginia, coming from tbe inhabitants of that State, of which there are two clases who, specialty, discourage immigration. One of these is the Old Virginia gentleman who, with hie admiration for everything Knglish, will fc'arve before be con-eats to sell out his broad acres of broom sedge, which, unproductive to him. would furnish happv and comfor'able hoir e? for do/ensof industrious families. These Sir ttog-r de Coverlys, admirable as their char. acter? are in many respects, cannot be considered wise or prudent, and mu"?t ultimately aoapt themselves to the circumstances by wb.^b they are surrounded. If they do not, so much the worse tor tbtm. The immense capitalists ol Lnglaud, with their laws of entail, can preserve tbeir estates and manage large farms and make them productive by grinding down tbe laborers: bnt bow can the impoverished land owners of Virginia hope to tollow these models' Their lands will be divided ultimately, in spite of all they can do. and they should endeavor to mage them as profitable as possible, both for tbe good of themselves and of their State. The other clas-? to which we refer are the antipodes of the conservative gentle nen we hate named, but they naturally exist aide by side, and bo h are the offspring of the same system. They are the idle toung men of the Sonth, who, disdaining labor, loaf around the bar-rooms of country taveras. talking pontics and cnrsing the Yankees and negroes, and lynching them if strong enongh to do ?>o, instead of rolling up their >leeves and going to work. They are tb? bane of lheir section, but mast certainly adapt themselves to the new circumstances by which they are being surrounded, or pass away. LIsewhere in our paper to-day we i copy from the Alexandria Journal a record <>t the exploits of some of this chivalric class ,n Virginia, near tbis District, who have been engaged assaulting colored people, and committing other outrages The spirit which prompted these deeds is similar to that which led to the attacks on camp.meetings in Mary, land a lew months since. That sncb conduct i?> countenanced by any considerable number of tbe people we do not believe, bnt it is the duty of all law-abiding citizens to help actively in tbe work of suppressing such disorder*. and bringing the actors to punishment. It depends ob Virginians themselves whether they will have a rich and populous State, or whether tbe condition of affairs described by Governor Wise m hi?, is to continue or grow worse Tbe Governor said on the occasion we refer to: "Instead of ba*ng to feed cattleon a thousand hills, you have had to chase tne stump-tailed steer through the sedge-patcbes to procure a tough beet eteak." And what was true then is doubly true now. KiBtPBt as Llizahbth of Eholasd -The National Theater was crowded last night, and we noticed among tbe audience several h?ad* ot departments, foreign ministers and attaches. Senators and Representatives, and a gnnt many distinguished army officers and prom* inent civilians. Tbe performance was worthy of tbe splendid audience which witnessed it, and deserved their enthusiastic applause. Not till last Bight did the public here realize the woBdertnl power and capacity of the great tragedienne, and tbeir verdict at the close of thk Play was, "There is bnt one Kistori." The play is the only drama based on the life of the maided Wnten, and Is the production of a <3-eno? ete. All t>/ tb? principal incidents in her life are worked ap with great dramatic ability, and tke interest. wil*eb never droops, culminates in the flftb act. By almost nnanimons requesthis play will be rep#a.'*d on Saturday eve. mug. Tbis evening, Macu^h ' QaOTKB'S OBAB D (ilBMAS OrtftA Troppk. Tne most eminent artists of tbis celebrated Company, so well known and highly appre. lated in thia city, will give two Grand Con. certs at Met jerott Hall, on Monday and Tues. day evenings of next week. Frederica, Her. mans, Habelman, Himmer, Formes, and Miss Clara Lang will ail appear, and ia addition to the regnlar Concert programme will sing th?? second act of "Martha" and the garden act of s'Fanst." Thi Weeklt Star is now on onr counter for aale. and in wrappers, ready for the mails, containing, among much other reading matter, I continuation of the articles on "The Future of j tbe Sonth;" tbe President's Message and accompanying iKxrumentsj the Mass Welcome to ' Congress, with tbe spooch of Jndge Cartter l and reply of Speaker Colfax; the opening Of ' Congress, the Republican Caucuses, the Mexican difficulty, capture ot John H Surratt; Congressional proceedings: Humorous Sketches, with lK>mekt;C.

Dec. ?.?Hotatfe Greeley, in a letter to Governor Perry, says the true basis of settlement ol all our troubles i? universal suffrage. He would have all disability because of rebellion and of color utterly and absolutely abolished, and strongly hopes and trust, a settlement on this Oasis will be made at Washington ibis winter. Governor Perry says impartial suffrage may he accomplished by'per milling alt persons, hlark and white, to vote, w ho are twenty-one years of age. but tbe Southern people" will never consent to tbls, as it would degrade tbe right of suffrage and demoralize tbe Government and society, li proposed. To enfranchise 'he negroes who conld read and write and bold a property qualification, without disfranchising white persons, might, with reason and propriety, be acceded to by the Southern States. Governot Perry s'rongly urges a national convention for the adjustment of all difficulties, and thinks an association of loyal, patriotic and virtuous men from all parts ol the country would have a salutary influence in adjoftiug the present difficulties.
