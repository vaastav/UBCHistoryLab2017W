The Semi-Weekly Miner BUTTE. DECEMBER 6,1884. Cleveland has a plurality of the popular vote of about 50,000 accord ing to latest advices. Lost, strayed or stolen, since elec tion; one William E. Chandler. . When last seen he was quoting scrip ture to the oankrupt firm of Jones, Elkins A Co. Foul play is suspected. The impeachment of Lot Wright, United States marshal for the South ern District of Ohio, in the House of Representatives will, in the course of the investigation to follow, show to the world the methods employed by -Republican marshals throughout the country to carry elections for their party. Turn the rascals out. Morning Journal: Commissioner Pine, of the New Orleans Exhibition, has a well-planned idea of a board ing house. In chartering the Great Eastern for a floating hotel he has struck a bright thought. Floating hotels in New York waters would pay. Many a landlord who finds it hard to keep afloat on shore might manage it at sea. An Investment in watered stock of this character would enable an enterprising proprietor to salt down his profits to advantage. The report of the Utah commis sioners is made public. The com missioners say they have succeeded in preventing a large number of polygamists from voting, but that their disfranchisement has had no effect upon abating polygamy. On the contrary it was followed by a polygamic revival. The institution is still boldly and defiantly defended by Mormon teachers and converts are being added to it. In view of these facts the commissioners think the Federal Government should take into its control all civil power in the Territory and fill every office by ap pointme nt. More recent advices from the South prove conclusively that the stories in the Blaine organs about the alarm of the colored population touching the approaching change in the adminis tration are gross exaggerations. The few ignorant negroes who were at first disposed to believe the Republi can "yarn" that the election of Cleveland meant a return to slavery have gotten over their scare. The Southern people have rejoiced—as they had a perfect right to do—but they have not inflicted any damage upon the country. The incendiary Blaine organs have not as yet been able to evolve an "outrage" or stim ulate a "massacre." As a matter of fact, tue South is happy and hopeful and the negroes are better off than they have been since the close of the war. Speaking of the interference of United States marshals at elections the Omaha Herald has the following to say: Everybody knows but ««at for the bulldozing interference of U. S. Marshals, Chicago would have given Carter Harrison a larger ma jority than that which he received last year as mayor, for in the state where those partisan hirelings could not ply their nefarious business, his inroads into tbe Republican majorty were simply marvelous. Not satis fied with tbeir dirty work on elec tion day, which alone prevented the election of a Democratic governor and a great number of legislators, the manipulators of the Long John ring now try to hold an after elec tion, upon the Louisiana plan, in order to save to Illinois a Republican Senator. Gentlemen, it will not do. There are honest judges in Chicago, and that is all the Democrats ask to frustrate your dark and fraudulent schemes. ANOTHER LIB NAILED. One of the pasttimesof tbe defeated Republican press is tbe inventing of stories designed to stir up bad feelings in tbe bosom of tbe victorious De mocracy. One of the latest is a tele gram from Albany claiming that Vice-President-elect Hendricks' re cent visit to Mr. Cleveland resulted in a coolness between these gentle men. It was sta ed that Mr. Hen dricks laid down to Mr. Cleveland tbe doctrine that the "spoils" must be dealt out to Democrats with a liberal band and that tbe Independents must be ignored. To this, it is re lated, Mr. Cleveland took exceptions. Hence the coolness. A lie so absurd upon its face would hardly have done credit to the heat of tbe ca n vass. Mr. Hendricks is a gentleman to begin with. He knows that be has nothing to do with Mr. Cleveland's patronage, and he certainly would not make himself offensive by offer ing» "policy" without invitation. Besides, Mr. Hendricks says that dur ing his call upon the Governor tbe subject of politics was not men tioned. It was purely a social visit, THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM Tbe saying is as true as it is old that one may lead a horse to water but be cannot be made to drink. It is equally true that one may present a pure religion to a people but they cannot be made to accept it. The Utah ommissioners have doubtless felt the force of these truths. They were appointed to carry out the pro visions of the Edmunds anti-polyg amy act In order to suppress polyg amy and to destroy, as far as possi ble, tbe power of the Mormon church In Utah. They have not met with encouraging success. It is true that polygamists have been disfranchised and prevented from holding office, but the belief in the right and duty of members of the Mormon church to contract plural marriages has not been legislated out of them. The fangs of the serpent have been drawn but tbe serpent lives. Practical polygamists have been shorn of cer tain civil rights but polygamy is on the increase. The Mormon pr blem still remains unsolved. It seems the only way to destroy the Mormon power in Utah is to make the church unpopular with theyeuDg men of the Territory and leave to time the re sults. The church cannot live unless it is fed by new recruits. 

NIHILISM. Times are ticklish in Russia. Alex ander III. is as seriously appre hensive of personal danger as bis father was, and every precaution is taken to protect his august majesty. Another matured plot against his life has been recently discovered. Neither public execution, nor tbe dreaded consignment to tbe wildern« ss of Siberia, with hard labor in tbe mints as an additional determent, effects tbe resolute Nihilists. According to tbe Moscow Gazette. sedition has reached as high as lieu tenant-cdlonels in tbe army, and is not likely to : stop there. Auother Russian paper thinks that the "canker of Nihilis'ii has eaten through every class of society, pri vate and official " A St. Petersburg correspondent of the Loudon 1 im s says that "the rector of the Universi ty of Karkofl has informed tbe stu dents, who are giving signs of de monstrating against tbe evictions of tbeir comrades at Ktett, that in con formity with the new University statutes, all those taking part in any kind of meetiug will be immediately and summarily expelled." Yet, in spite of this warning, three hundred of the students arose In in subordination and were dispersed by the police. Expulsion had no terrors for them.. Says tbe correspondent: "Indications of growing agitation are observable in other universities, and further troubles are very prob able," A dispatch from Vienna says that a letter to the Political Correspon dence from St. Petersburg "refejrs to anotner increase in Nihilistic Agita tion in that capital, in the provinces a manifesto has been circulated among the peasants, urging tb^m to hostilities agaiust the higher classes. This has led to some risings against landed proprietors." A few of tue peasants have been executed for re volt. To tbe Nihilists is attributed the cause of tbe disturbance. They are here, there and every where in Russia. The "matured plot" against tbe Czar's life may be only an existence of police imagination. At any ratje the police bave discovered nothing definite m that direction yet. j But it is natural''enough that his Imperial Majesty is sensitively apprehensive. It is natural enough, too, thatl the conspirators against bis person, if such there be, keep their regiCidal attention a profound secret not to be penetrated by tbe guardians of! the law. I Tbe assassin, when he strikes, especially at a shining mark, strikes unexpectedly. The Czar is well •guarded, both in his palace and on tue road when traveling; but certain of his recent predecessors have fallen, notwithstanding precautions, whether in their stately home o|r on tbe highway. The present rultfr of all the Russians does not evidently sit on a throne of quietness. His daily life is one of continual uneasi ness that displays itself in his every public motion. THEgPRESIDENT'S 

MESSAGE The extreme length of President Arthur's message precluded the por. sibility of publishing it all in this journal at the time of its delivery to j Congress. It is now before us in its entirety. It is a well-written docu ment, contains no startling proposi tions, and considers a great variety of topics. Tbe patience of tbe people in awaiting the announcement of the result of the recent general election io highly commonded, aud reierrecl to as an evidence of the strength and wisdom of our political institu tions. Our relations with all foreign pow ers are amicable; the war between Chili and Peru is at an end and a convention will soon be negotiated to arbitrate the claims of American citizens who suffered through the Cnilian authorities. China has paid tbe claims of American citizens whose property was destroyed at ihe recent riot at Canton. The Presi dent has recognized the flag of tbe International Association of tbe Con go and has appointed a commercial ageut for the Congo basin. He advises the restoration of the agency and Consul General at Cairo on its f >rmer basis, to the end that American citizens sojourning in Egypt may be properly represented. Hesuggests that Congress lake sCme action in regaid to tbe spirit which prompted France to give to America the Bartholdi Statue of Liberty En lightening tbe World. We have extradition treaties with several of the German States, but as they are not as comprehensive and uniform in tbeir application as tbe interests of both countries require, the President suggests that' negotia tions be opened to embrace all tbe territory of the empire. He favors the extension of tbe Sandwich Is land« reciprocity treaty for seven years longer. He favors the abolition of duties on works of ari; calls tbe attention of Congress to our reciprocity treaty with Mexico and tbe necessity of tariff legislation to make tne treaty effective; intimates his desire to see a canal railway built across the Isth mus of Nicaraugua by the United States, and believes the country should preserve strict neutrality! in strifes between all foreign powers. The President thinks our naturali zation laws should be revised; that tbey should be made uniform in tilieir operations. He recommends tuat tbe coinage of silver be suspended, and tbe withdrawal of all $1 and! $2 treasury notes from circulation that room may be made for a correspond ing amount of silver.. He urges more legislation in regard to Utah, and favors tbe lodging the appointment of all civil offieersj in the Territory in tbe hands of a com missioner. He thinks our financial condition is good, and calls upon Congress to devise some means to In crease our foreign trade. In regard to free trade and protec tion tbe President puts the case in a nutshell as follows: "It seems to me that many of the embarrassing ele ments in tbe great national convict between protection and free trade may thus-be turned to good account; that the revenue may be reduced; so as no longer to overtax the people. The protective duties may be re tained without becoming burden some, that our shipping interests may be judiciously arranged and the currency fixed on a firm basis; and, above ail, such a unity established among the States of the Americjan system as will be of great and ever increasing advantage to them all. All treaties in the line of this policy, which have been negotiated or are j in progress of negotiation, contain a provision deemed to be requisite len der the clause of the constitution limiting to the House of Representa tives the authority to originate for raising revenues." These are the most salient features of the message, and if there is noth ing very remarkable in the docu ment the reason is found in tbe fact that there is no very remarkable sues at present before the country which require special mention lpy the President. % ■— MBTcöNmfwrsiippüRT: — Since it was announced that Mr. Roscoe Conkling would probably be a candidate for the United States Senate ne has received support from a variety of strange and unexpected sources. But tbe strangest of all tbe cbaDges which bas brought to his train many of bis ancient enemies is that which gives him the support of the New York Herald. In a recent double-leaded editorial that journal makes tbe following announcement: "Of coarse, Mr. Conkling will not thank us nor appreciate our support, for we believe, since tbe course taken by the Herald in regard to his esca pade in resigning from the Senate, he has never forgiven us. But th* Herald cares little about that. We thina Conkling necessary to the na tion, and because we think so we support him. Let Conkling in the same manner accept, because he is useful to tbe nation. Everybody knows he in as vain as a peacock, but everybody knows also that be has the wisdom of the owl. His ex perience has shown him his peacock mistakes and taught him the wisdom of the owl, and we believe him to be a patriot." This is very handsome on the part of the great New York journal, and must be a source of grat ification to Mr. Conkling to receive the support of his old antagonist. 

TAKING ALARM. movement The Denver Tribune Republican announces that a Silver Convention will be held in that city the 28th of next January by the leading miners of the State and others interested in the continued coinage of silver. The fact cannot longer be dis guised that the single standard men of eastern money centers aré now more thoroughly organized in oppo sition to silver than ever and will make a most obstinate fight for the repeal of the Bland silver coinage act. The mining men of Colorado realize this fact and hence tbeir call for the convention mentioned. The Denver paper says it "has frequently suggested that tbe men who are interested in the coinage of silver should organize to protect their interests, just as the cattle men and sheep-growers of the Wist have foimed so itties for the advaucement and protection of their interests. The advantages of these organizations are already apparent, although the socie ties have been in existence but a short time. Both the cattle and sheep interests have received great benefit from their respective associa tions, and there is no reason why tbe silver-men should not be benefited by an organization of the same nature." Continuing tbe Tribune:Republi can adds: "The prime motive for the calling of a Silver Convention is to adopt some line of action to check mate the gold standard men, who have greatly increased in numbers and influence during Ihe past two years. We can think of no better way to do this than to form an asso ciation of silver^roducerc. It should be broad enough to take in as mem bers the mining men of all the silver States and Territories. Of course the first step would be to form a State as sociation; the others would follow. As Colorado is the chief silver State, it is her duty to take tbe lead in the The silver question and tbe need of protecting the silver in terests should be agitated by every newspaper in Colorado. We shall be the losers if we shall be apathetic." The advice is opportune and should be heeded. The mining men of Mon tana and especially ot Butte are as deeply interested in this matter as the silver producers of Colorado are. There is danger ahead and tbe sooner the fact is realized and steps taken to avert it the better it will be for our mining men. Tbey have to contend not only against tbe gold standard men of the East but tbey have a gold standard press at home to fight. They should organize an association of silver producers in this Territory and make themselyes teit. The battle against the metal will be bitter one and its enemies can be defeated only by united action upon the part of those interested it ils pro duction. Omaha Herald: Martin Magin nisis entering a protest at Wash ington to defeat the scheme of a Col orado cat . le syndicate which proposes to lease the reservation of tbe Crow Indians. The people of the Territory are very much aroused about it. The Crow chiefs are quoted as saying that they signed tbe lease under threats that if they refused tbeir rations would be cut off. The reservation was visited a year ago by a Senate committee consisting of Senators Vest, Dawes and others, who recom mended the purchase from the Crows of ail the lauds they did not need and putting it into market for actual settlers. Secretary Teller also visited the reservation and indorsed the recommendations of the committee of the Senate. He is now suspected of winking at the Colorado swindle with a view to political promotion for himself, and hereby may haDg an untold tale. It seems as if Mr. Blaine's worst fears concerning the South wonld come to pass. Preliminary steps were taken at a meeting of lead ing white and colored citizens of New Orleans last week to estab lish at some central point in the South a university of applied sciences forgiving the graduates of colored schools a thorough training, both theoretical and practical, in the lead ing trades. This is an entering wedge to the destruction of the chief business of the plantation darkey, which consists in playing politician, and directed him into channels in tended only for white trash, namely, the trades. We concede the negroes have cause to feel alarmed. The Civil Service Law "dcee Dot apply to officers appointed by the President, by and with the consent of tne Senate * * . It applies only to those officials who are employed in the Departments in Washington and in the large offices of the Gov ernment elsewhere * * . The law does not touch the question of tenure of office or of removal from office." So says Senator Pendleton, who ought to know, and so reads the law itself. The mention of Mr. Conkling's name in connection with the New York Senatorship has brought down upon the head ot that peaceful, un obtrusive citizen a vast amount of abuse from unprincipled Half-Breed newspapers, but it is all of a kind that testifies vigorously to the fact that Mr. Conkling is about the largest Republican in the Und. 

GOYERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS. A Washington paper says: There is more work upon the calendars of Congress than can be done between now and March 4, if no more bills »re introduced. Among those whicn, if passed, will take the mot money from the Treasury are the following: The Blair Educition bill has passed tbe Senate. As passed by the Sen ate it appropriate $77,000,000. The pension bills are almost limitless m their demands. A rough estimate shows that the amouut required to carry out the provi*i< ns of tbe pen sion bills is $ 150,000,1X10. Twenty five millions more will be needed to tulfill tbe provisions of Senator Wade Hampton's bill to;>ay officers oft e colonial armies half pay for life, which was authorized by various acts of Congress. One hundred bills are pending which provide for pub lic buildings. Most of them will nn doub'edly go through before March 4. Tbe total amount appropriated by them is $20,001),000. The Ben Holiday, McGarrahan and a troop of private claims, which appear annually and cost the Govern ment thousands ef dollars for print ing and paper, call for 13-1,000,000, while $24,000,000 will be needed to reimburse the States for claims against tbe Federal Government for moneys expended during tbe revolu tionary and Indian wars, and the war of the rebellion. An estimate of the amount required to equalize bounties Is $'00 000,000. One million will be needed to establish new sol diers' homes in Kansas, Michigan ana other States. The French spoli ations. Venezuela and other depre dation claims foot up $10,000,000. The Wemple-bill asking $10,000,000 for the permanent improvement of the Erie Canal, togettier with tbe Maryland and Delaware Ship Canal bill, tbe Henne in Canal proposition, the bill for ne* cruisers, and the payment of other mis'eilaneous claims, together with tbe River and Haib >r bill, would swell tbe amount to nearly $600,000,000, which Congress is asked to appropriate, aside from tbe regular appropriation bills. Some ot these measures have re eeived favorable reports from the various committees, and it is quite likely that in tbe hurry of a snort session many "jobs" will be rushed through. It has been determined by tbe Catholic Plenary Council, now is ses sion in Baltimore, to give fitting recognition in future to tbe Puritan national holiday of Thanksgiving Day. This is a step in the right di rection on the part of the Catholic Church in this country. The day. as it is now observed, is no longer reli gious or sectional. It is rational in every sense of tbe word. There is no good reason why the members of every church should not on that day unite in returning thanks to Him who holds the nations in the hollow of His hand. In his report Secretary Lincoln turns over General Hazcn without any consideration for that gentle man's feelings, as the General used to have the reputation of baudling his pen with great skill and ability it is fair to presume be will take some notice of the Secretary's reflec tions. As the Republican party is more or less de- troyed General Hazen need not restrain himself out of political considerations. Let slip the dogs of war. It is estimated that New York gave Mr. Blaine more than 50,000 Irish votes, and that Butler shunted over to him not less than 10,000, all Democrats before. It required not less than 60,000 Independents to match that defection, and it is these men in New York, Connecticut and other States, that are being read out of the party by the defeated followers of the Plucked Knight of Maine. Ex*3enator John B. Gordon, of Georgia, has written a letter to the New York Commercial Advertiser emphasizing the position of the New South from his point of view, and assuring thit Republican paper and its readers that sectionalism is a thing of the past; that the rights of the colored people are and will be protected,and that the comiDg Denu - cratic administration will extinguish the last trace of ill-will between the races in the South. President Arthur will doubtless be gratified to learn that Minister Kas son, whom he appointed, proposed at the American Thanksgiving ban quet at Benin three cheers for Mr. Cleveland and none for him. Usu ally the President in office is toasted on such an occasion. But Kassou don't care just now whom he cheets, except when it promises cheer to himself. Kasson evidently likes Berlin. _ In his report Secretary Teller de rives much satisfaction from the fact that "the past year has been one ot peace among the Indians, and that no outbreaks have occurred." A certain person by the name of George Crook deserves no little share for this satisfactory showing. It is said that Governor Cleveland is the constant recipient of threaten ing letters from cranks, who aver in many would-be startling ways that he will never be permitted to enter the White House alive to "usurp" the office of President. These letters have been more frequent since Blaine's Augusta speech. It is not likely Mr. Cleveland loses any sleep over them. Montana, Idaho and Washington Territory elected Democratic dele gate« to Congress. Dakota is the only one on the whole line of the Northern Pacific that elected a Re publican. In throwing its influence for the Republican nominees in these Territories the Northern Pacific made a blunder. General Logan's friends say he will be a candidate for the Presidency in 1888. In the meantime Mrs. Logan will lock tbe General's mouth and throw the key awav. Mr. Cleveland will resign the Gov ernorship ot New York the 6ih prox imo. He does this in order to give himself time to select his cabinet and other important officials for promi nent positions. a THE 

BARTHOLDI STATUE. The President in his message called upon Congress to recognize in fitting terms the gift of the oartboldi statue to the United States by France. Con gress will doubtless act upon the sug gestion and thank France for the magnificent gift. But it now looks as ttiough the gift will have to be hung up in mid air, like Mahomet's coffiu, in tbe absence of a pedestal to rest upon. Appeal after appeal has Leen made lor funds to construct one but thus far with poor success. If tue majestic figure could speak what 1 tory wou.d she have to tell visitors who will gaze upon her of tbe mean ness, parsimony and unpairiotism of our people who buttoned up tneir pockets and failed to provide a pedestal for her to stand upon until tne money bad been doled out in pitiiul sums in answer to begging appeals. Wnat are (tie facts of the case. Let ut> see. Tu* people of France just 1 after a deductive and inti-over sit ing war, sataed enough mouc-y to present to the people of the Untied duties tue great work of Bartuoldi, as tne gilt ot a young European Re public, just learning to walk atone. A spot was selected on a little island in me harboi of New York where it could stand, facing'the Etat, to wel come those who come to tbe land of liberty through the gate of that great commercial metropolis. Yet with all tue boasted riches and ail the boasted patriotism of this great country ila people, like nig gards, have refused to douate tbe once of a pedestal on which to place tne offering of the Freuen nation, i'he country is full of millionaires, who, by the dash of a pen, could have saved this disgrace. It is full of speculating politicians who readily subscribe a hundred thousand dol lars or so to assist in stealing an elec tion. It has bonanza kings and merchant princes, yet amoiig them ad tbe Bartholdi pedestal goes beg ging for a sum wuicb, to many of them, is less than they would spend on a dinner or a ball, Shame on such parsimony. Shame on such waut ot patriotism. The amount n eded wiil piobably be raised by popular sub scr.ption. It should be. Money bags should be debarred. Thus raised it would be a pleasant compliment to the G ddess and a deserved rebuke to our men of large means and larger meannes s. Fred Grant is trying to prevail upon tbe President to give him a place in the armv. It is said he desires especially to have the next vacancy in the Quartermaster's corps. The officers in this branch of the service rank as captains. The President has been reluctant to make any promise, as these places are re garded as the lawful prizes of all the hard-working first lieutenants in the service, in the same way as the pests of army paymasterships are the special property of tbe captains in the regular service. Promotion in the army is. now so slow that any out side appointment into either of the above-mentioned branches of service invariably creates a perfect storm from disappointed army men. It is not believed at Washington that Fred Grant will succeed. The Pres ident could not do a more unpopular thing. Grant resigned his place in the army to try his fortune in bue ii ess, and for him to go back into tbe army now, however great his per sonal needs would be, would work much injustice. the j According to the New York World Civil Service Reform has received a slight shock in Washington. Sergt. Bratnard performed exceptionally gallant services in the Greejy Arctic expedition, Almost everybody, in cluding Sergt. Brainard, expected that he would be appointed to a va cant lieutenancy in the army. But the coveted prize fell easily into the lap of Attorney-General Brewster's adopted son, Wright, and Brainard is left out in the cold, to a degree sur passing his Arctic experience. Mean while tne Attornev-General placidly parades his ruffled shirt bosom and cuffs. Sergt. Brainard and his im mediate friends are rattier ruffled, too. Tlae Springer Committee. Washington, Drc. 5.—At a meet ing ot the committee on expenditure«« in the department of justice to-day, Cnairmau Springer read a letter from J. J. Barker, former treasury clerk, reiterating chaiges made by him some time ago agaiust the manage ment of tbe office of the first comp troiler of the treasury department. In explanation of tbe charges Barker said he called the attention of the comptr« Her to what he considered illegal allowances of per diem. He said he bad written adecision on this same subject. I toid him his decis ion had not reached tbe fourth door of his office. Tne comptroller toid me one bill for per diem was out rageous aud shou d not be allowed, but it was allowed in other cases. JL objected to the payment of claims as illegal, but they were allowed. I called the attention ot ihe chief of diyisi .n to certain irregular voucheis and be replied it was u*»ne of our bm iness. There were other accounts tor $11,000 that were the result of the Star Route trials. I told tbe comptrol ler they were illegal. He said he had signed tnem, without examining tnem. I toid him he could not afford to sign them. He replied he could afford to, because he bad already done so. I think the attor ney general influenced the comptrol ler to allow the $11,000. I went to the chairman of the committee and to Senators VauWyck and Harrison and attempted to have these things corrected, but 1 found every obstacle thrown in my way. Referring to the first comptroller, Barber said: I believe Judge Lawrence to be bonest but be is so exclusively engaged in the production of bis decislonslie has not time to attend to tbe details of his office. Before adjournment the committee directed the chairman to appoint a sub committee to investi gate the matteis referred to by Bar ker. A resolution was adopted request ing the secretary of the treasurv to furnish the committee copies of all vouchers on file in the treasury de partment, concerning nay men ts to United States Marshal Wright, and other court officials of the Southern District of Ohio for general and special deputy marshals at tbe con gressional election in October and for a statement of tbe amounts allowed and paid on account of their services A resolution was also adopted, directing tbe chairman to request the attorney general to furnish tne com mittee with copies of all correspond ence between bis department aud United States Marshal WrRlit in tef rence to the employment if United States deputy marshals at the same election.

The governor incidentally alluded to the report of a quarrel between himself and Hendricks, saying that they did not i«i their conversation discuss politics and that two men never parted more pleasantly- Tdis congressman drew from his conversa tion with Cleveland that the latter has not y.et made up b s mind with regard to a single cabinet appoint ment. He is deferring these matters uLtil he retires from the governor ship. A Decision. Boston, Dr-e. Judge Blodgett to-day rendered a occision' in the cases ot James P. Frost and Daniel A. Banders, of tne Boston Globe , charged with contempt of court in refusing to disclose to the grand jury their source for certain recent infor mation in regard to an old murder case in this city. The judge's de cision is in effect that the lactsin the case did not warraut tbe commit ment of tbe journalists for contempt., as the question was a narrow one and resolved itself down to the question whether or not geutlemen should di vulge the names ot persons who had giveu them information. Tne deci sion was awaited with the greatest interest by tbe journalistic profes sion. London News. London, Dec. 4.—Skye crofters are movning in favor of a no rent policy.
