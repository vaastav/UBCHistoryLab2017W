(iENPKAL REVIEW OF THE ERNMEX L -S CONDITION. GOV Wants to Let Cuba and Spiin Settle Their own Troubles Without Iutai ferenct'. Bv the courtesy of the Western Ln ion Telegraph company the following synopsis of President Cleveland's message sjnt to congress this morning was delivered over the wires today to the press. As representatives of the people in the legislative branch of their govern ment you have asseinbltd at a time when the strength and excellence of our free constitution and the fitness of our citi.eos to CDjoy popular rule have been ara:n made manifest, A Djlitical contest involving momen tous conseo'icces fraught with fever- h aporehension ar.u creating aggres- iveness so intense as to approach bit- tcrnts', has Deen wageu tnrougnout our laud and determined by the decree of free aud indepenoent suffrage with out distui banco of our tranquility or the least sign of weakness in our na tional structure. When we consider these incidents and con ten-, plate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have sue ceeded a heated clash of political opin ions, we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times bv an abiding- faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to de mand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as i an oniy be prompted by a serious ap preciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites. With this analysis of the recent election, President Cleveland begins his annual message to congress. The document contains more than -0.000 words. It contains besides a wealth of department information and statistics, a succinct review of the Cuban revo lution without committing the United States government to an avowal ot hostility, either against the sovereign ty of Spain or Cuban insurgents. President Cleveland begins that por tion of his message devoted to foreign affairs by referri ng congress to the re port of the Secretary ior ail ueuus in onnection with minor matters, ne then declares that the disturbed con dition in Asiatic-Turkey has assumed a less hideous and blood y aspect dur ing the past year, owing to the deci sive action on the part oi me great nations and the consequent awakening of the Turkish government to the de mand of humane civilization. So far as the United States government is concerned it has left undone nothing for the protection of American m:s- ionaries and citizeus la the Ottoman empire. Continuing, me presiueui- -aj . , 1 do not helieve tne present somot-e prospers in Turkey will be long per mitted to offeud the sight of Christ- ndom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century, that it teems haidly posiblo that the earnest demand of good people through out the christian world for its uorruc- t ive treatment will remain unanswer ed." President Cleveland, in dealing with the Cuban situation, unalterably op poses the recognition of the insurgents ' . ... tt 1.. 1; . .1 as belligerents, tie utnuita me san ation to be too delicate for any inter vention on the part of the I nited States at the present time, although his message strongly hints that the ul timate outcome may require an ag gressive stacd on the part of this gov ernment. With greatest delicacy he devotes a large portion of his message to a review oi the situation ana puiuis as a solution of the problem, the offer tD Cuba on the part of bpaiu of genu ine, autonomy. The insurrection he declares still continues with all its per plexities. No d-iiis on has been reacn- ed in the trial at ai ms. If Spain has not reestablished cer authority neither have the insurgents made good their t itle to be recognized as an independent state. Pretext that civil government exists on the island except so far as lapain has oeen able to maintain it, has been practically abandoned. 'But that exception b'.nng made, the entire country is either given over to anarchy or is subject to a military oc cupation of one or other party. It is reported on reliable authority tnat at the demand ol commauucr-iu-coie-i ui the insurgent army, the putative Cub an government has now given up all attempts to exercise its functions, leav ing that government contesseaiy (nut there is the best reason for supposing it always to have been in fact) a gov ernment merely on paper." lJ.-uaiilf.nt. fMeveland is disposed to ou-nowh-do-e the superiority of the Spanish arms and of the Cuban tactics. Be savs. however, unless a speedy con tf in t.hH oncn is had, the policy of the Spaaish government not to inter fere with the destruction of property will ruin the fertility, productiveness and cr.nscouent commercial value of the island. The message points out the many fmt.vnirlf.il interests of the United Stitcs in Cuba. Almost fifty million of American capital is invested there nnd the trade before the revolution reached one hundred million annually. Our concern in Cuba is neither i-entl-iTn.nt,nl mi:' w hoilv philanthropic but we are in niauy was loth vexatuinsly mid tn much cost involved in th- pre ent contest. He points out the difficul ties which we are subjected to by reason of the many Cuban residents who are natural. zed Americans and who whiln aiding the insurrection through public meetings, the press war funds and other means n quire tne constant vionanc" ' "i- a i i nun i ie:s Washington. Besides the natural sympathy of the people of t his contary with those who struggle for a better and a freer government, combin with the ad venturers and restless ele ments in Kurooe. makes the position of the United States in its declared neu trality difficult to maintain. These in evitable entanglements and cons dera tion of philanthropy and humanity in general have led to a vehement de mand in varum- quarters fi r some sort of po.Mt.ve intervention on the part of the Uni 'il St-te f The president declares against ac- think Spain desires to sell and deprec iates war with Spain as a settlement of the question on the ground that might is no sufficient reason for this country to violate its universal repu tation as the most pacific of powers and the desire of its people to live in amity with all the world. The United States, he says, has plenty of territory and should continue to manifest its patient endurance, which is no slight testimonial of the reeard for Spain on the part of the American people. While remembering- the part Spain has played in the history of the west ern hemisphere neither the people or the government of the United States have shut their eyes to the cours-i of Spain in this contest. After summing ud the complications of international law bearing on the case, the president says: '"It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home rule, vhich, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain would satisfy all rational requirements , of her Cuban subjects there should be no reason why the pacification oi the island might not bd affected on that basis. It would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes of its in habitants within their own control without severing the national and an cient ties which bind them to the mother country. It has been intimat ed to Spain and that country does not seem unwilling to adopt the suggestion that the United Slates act as mediator in bringing about this result. .At the same time Spain aemanuB mat tne in surgents lay down their arms before a compromise will be considered and the Cubans insist on something more defi nite than a promise of autonomy before they will consent to do so." In any event the president says, theLnittd States should make no attempt to ac-j quire the island ana snouici prevent any other power from acquiring it. If however, the ability of Spain to dem onstrate its sovereignty becomes mani fest, the United States should not Hes itate to recognize and discharge its duties without in any way mean while stimulating a disregard to duty or ill timed expression of feeling. Brieily touching on tne enezueian boundary ciuestion and the Behring ea complications, the president then devotes himself to internal affairs. His message takes up in detail the var ious debts of the national government. In the treasury department the re ceipts for 190 were 4oy,4.-,405; ex penditures, $434,67S.)54.4S; decrease S2o,203,24o.70.

Total metallic money in the U. S. July 1, 81,228, 320,- U35 of which $599.597,i04 was gold and 5-029,728,071 was silver. Not. 1, 1890 total money in the United faiates was 2S,410,o90 and the amount in cir culation exclusive of treasury holdings was SI, 027,Ooo,641, or $22 04 per capita on a population oi i.youuo. me coinage of these metals throughout f e world the same year was $232. .01.438 in gold and $121,995,219 in silver. Oct. 6:.h, 1890 there were 3.(i9 national banks in operation with d,OJ,o?o,- 000 resources. Of the lia bilities $1,590,S91,038.03 was due lepositors and $210,000,000 was ln n outstanding circulating notes. New banks wero organized and 3. surrendered their charters, while for others receivers were appointed. State banks to the number of 5,708 are in existence during the year, ?j40,4i5 immigrants arrived bringing to this country more than $500,000. In reviewing the war department. the president does not recommend an increased army, as he says the organiz ed militia numbers 112,8.9 men and costs 83,200,000 annually which should suffice. He believes both the regular army and militia should have more money for equipments. Kegarding the naw. the president commends trie expenditure of money for coast defenses, declares his belief in the ability of the government to build its own vessels and equipments: is opposed to paying any further speed premiums and re commends a plan for laying up ships in reserve so as to reduce tno cost oi maintaining our vessels afloat. Eight new cruisers and 2 gunboats have been commissioned and the chief executive ays American ships are equal to any that tloat. The president thinks federal offend ers should be confined in the govern ment prisons. The postoflice depart ment, he savs, is in good condition with a deficit "of $8,000,000 owing to a reduction of postal duties and the increrse without proportionate revenue in the lowclas mail matter. The total Indian population is 1..,- 235. The president believes the In dians show improvement under gov ernment management and recommends they be looked after by a commission one of whom shall be an army officer. President Cleveland hits the pension grabbers a hard blow. He shows that last year the number of pensioners materially increased until the list the largest ever reported, numoenng ;'.o,- 078 aud costing !Cl.fS..Ji4, ioi m. President Cleveland demands settle ment of the Pacific railway loans and grants aud especially the foreclosure of the Lmon Pacific mortgage. lie shows in the agricultural de partment that the value ot larm pro ducts exported in 1Mi amounted to $570,000,000. He is opposed to further gratuitous ilistribution of seed. Ihe inter state commerce and civil service laws are highly commended. While admitting a deficit of little more than 825,000,000 the president defends the Wilson tariff bill as having opened up foreigu markets and sim ulated trade with other countries, l ne present bill, he says will yield sufficient revenue if given a fair trial but the deficit was to be expected in the face of . the business depression of the past t wo ! years. In this connection he defends i drafts made on the reserve fund as the i. he. savs it is l rumeasuratu v better to appropriate our surplus to the p.iyment of justifiable expenses than to all -ivv it to become an invitation to class ap propriation aud extravagant expendi tures. The president alludes to our financial methods as weak and vicious and asks prompt reform of the sjsteiu which is oppose", to every rule of sound finance and sho-n hy experience to ne frauht with a previous peril and pe - plexity. Ho refers to the late con t . s as being greater menace to property than the late war. 11-: dec. at es financial peace cannot be secured until trov. i-ninent currency obligation upon which gold may be demanded are withdrawn from circulation, and can- cwU'ci. tfo ftiJvUc'atoB Weir Cttft'WSiog jLi-VNT-STS

They should he. allowed to issue circulation to the nar value of their deposits security and their circulation. Taxes should be reduced to one-fort h of one per C3ut. Summing up the financial situation, the president says: "The e-tire case may b3 presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial method will not dawn on us until our govern ment abandons the banking business and the accumulation cf funds and confines its monetary operations to the receipt of the money contributed by the people for its sup jort aud the expenditure of such money for the people's bene fit. All good citizens lonar for rest from feverish agitation and the inauguration bv the government of a reformed financial policy which will encourage enterprise and make certain the rewards of labor and industry." After denouncing the tendency of the times towards the creation of tru-sts and monopolists, the tendency of which the president said is to crush out industrial independence and to hinder or prevent the use of human faculties a-d the fail development of human character, he appeals to congress to exercise ricid economy, saying. ''The way of perplexing extravagance is easy but the way to frugality is perplex ing." President. Cleveland concludes as follows: "When our differences are forgotten and our contest of political opinions are no longer remembered, nothing in the retrospect of our public service will be as fortunate and comforting as the recollection of official duty well performed and a me mory of a constant devotion to the interest of our corliding fellow coun trymen." Ghover Cleveland. 

TEK1I11SLE SMASIMT. Five Men Killed in the Worst Freight Wreck the S. Jf. Ever Had. There was a terrib'e head-eud colli sion early Sunday morning of two freight trains, two miles east of Sand Pork siding on the Southern Pacific, or seventy one miles east of San Antonio: a collision that is regarded as the worst smash-up the road ever had in the wav of a freight wreck. Five trainmen were kli'ed viz., Knjineers Cody and Brown both men with families, and who ran east out of the city two years ago; both firemen, whose names at present writing areunRnown. but reside at Sau Antonio and strangers at this end of the line: while the fifth man killed was a brakeman, also from San Antonio, and who was evidently riding on the engine. The co lision was between an extra freight going east, aud the third sec tion of freight number 24 coming west. The extra evidently got mixed lip Oil the number of sections in the regular, or the engineer thought be could make the next siding bejoud Sandy Fork, for he pulled out Ivoui the Fork in time to meet the third section rushing west and evidently on a curve. From the size of the wreck both trains must have been going at full speed, for the demor alization of both engines and some twenty cars was complete, the engines being redu -ed to setup iron, and the carslo splinters, while through freight was scattered all over the right of way. Wrecking outfits we: c sent out from San Antonio and Houston just as soon as one of the surviving train bauds could run back two miles to Sandy Fork uml wire, and surgeons and medical appliances were takeu out from San Antonio in a coach attached to the wrecking train. The bodies wero re ported buried under the debris, but were pulled out as soon as the wreckers couUl remove the wreckage resting on the poor fellows. Life was found ex tinct. 1 r.e other tra'n men wero uiiuij- j shaken tp, but marvclously escaped. i the tr;u-K w.is tot ime d ist ance nu n to pieces and ir.e up, so a shoo My trai ro.ui bed plongho'l k was Viu'l! a: out d the v.-i ec, aid travel resumed altera delay of nearly ten hour.; Number twenty, pa-sei.ger, due iu this city at 2:15 this afti-rnoo'i, will b-- h re about l p in , in coi.s -queni c of the a -c-deu'.
