Any rural credit legis lation at this time, wtih a program already so complete, he believes would result in a fiasco. No criticism from the democratic side over the President's views on the army and navy are heard. On the contrary his opinion is supponeu without exception. When this por tion of the message was leached by the President the alertness of the members on both sides of the cham ber was noticeable, and when the doctrine of i,.ace and small standing army was announced, likewise notice able was the lack of approval from the entire republi an side of the chamber, save one or two members. Senator Gardner, who has been urging' a drag net inquiry as to the country's unpreparednets, received his answer last night from the rules committee when Mr. Henry of Texas, the chairman, sent him a letter ad vising that the special hearing for a rule on the Gardner resolution would not be given. He had conferred with democratic members of the committee and with the secretary of war and secretary or the navy, reaching the conclusion, with their approval, that the regular -ommittees of congress, now in session, was where Mr. Gard ner should ask for hearings. Without imputing improved motive to Mr. Gardner.
