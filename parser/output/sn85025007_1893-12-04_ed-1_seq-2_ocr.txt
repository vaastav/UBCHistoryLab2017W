MONDAY EVENING. DEC 4. IS! 3. Mr. S. G. Pattison, of Richmond, according to the report of an interview with him published iu the New York Herald of yesterday, says: "An income tax would certainly defeat the demo? cratic party. It is directly against pub? lic sentiment iu Richmond aud Vir? ginia." The democratic party, judging by the recent election, is by uo means assured of victroy at the uext one, and unless the democratic Congress shall pass an income tax, so as to make the rich bear at least a share of the ex? penses of the government, it is feared, by the wise, that defeat is the party's doom. Such a tax may be directly against the public sentiment of Rich? mond, but that it is directly in accord with nine tenths of that in the State at large, and of every other State in the rjnion, is patent to every body at all familiar with .such sentiment. Mb. Van Alex's course was dictated by delicate, refined aud gentlemanly fi < ling, and touches a responsive cord in the heart of every man capable of Appreciating that feeliug. The treat? ment he has received will be very like? ly to deter other high-toned men from subscribing to political fuuds iu future, but those who never do any thing with? out an expected consideration, will continue to buy offices with such sub? scriptions, as has been the rule ever since the rise of the republican party, by which suffrage has been debauched and polluted with money. A dispatch from Washington Bays that the Postmaster General and the Secretary of the Navy agree in the be? lief that the merit system of appoint? ment is of great value. So does every right thinking man. and no fair minded democrat opposes it. But for all that, I the men who made it possible for Messrs. Bissel! aud Herbert to hold their positions, believe that the merit system should at least have commenced with the offices equally divided between the two parties, and not almost entirely in the hands of the republican party, as they were, and continue to be. Some protectionists in Virginia say the removal of the tarill' tax on coal will result iu the great injury of the coal interests of the State. To show that they dont kuow what they are talking about, it is only necessary to mention the fact that Mr. MatSOD, presi? dent oi the Pocahontas coal company, says the placing of coal ou the free list will have scarcely any ellect upon his company, so little that they are not alarmed at if, and that it is of such s nail consequence to them that it is not worth their opposition. It is understood that the new tariff bill will increase the tax on cigarettes. Tiere could hardly be a wiser tax. Cigarettes are essentially a luxury, and besides, they are consumed largely by boys, to their own injury, aud to the annoyance of others. The laborer's pipe should be exempt from taxation, but the boy's cigarette should be taxed to the utmost extent. THE STRIKING miners in West. Vir? ginia have agreed to resume work on tlnir employer's terms. They are wise, but they would have been wiser if they had not struck at all, and be? sides, would have had more money in their pockets at Christmas. Tin: President is as wise in his ri commendation for the restoration of the legitimate government of Hawaii, as he is unwise iu failing to recommend the imposition of an income tax. Tu k Senatorial Contest.?General Pitz Lee, Sv-iiator Ilunton and Mr. Thomas S. Martin have opened head? quarters at the Exchange Hotel. Lot am! Martin are now here aud will re? main until the contest is fought to a finish. Senator Hunton may not come to Richmond at all, as Congress meets on Monday. EppaHunton, jr., will be here on Monday to take charge of his father's forces. General Lee is being ably assisted in his canvass by Mr. Miles M. Martin and others. Ex-Attorney General Rufus A. Avers and other warm frieuds of Lee are expected on Monday. Mr. Martin has several valuable lieu? tenants who will be here on Monday to go to work for him. His friend, Sena lot- .lames Hay. is now in Richmond, and Hon. Johu B. Moon, of Albemarle, will arrive to-morrow or next day. The Lee men said this morning that there had been a break in Martin s forces but the frieuds of the Scottsville gentleman declare that it is just the re? verse, that Martin will get votes Lee had couuted on. Yesterday a support? er of Mr. Martin asserted that he would receive all of the Hunton votes if the contest should uarrow down to Lee and Martin aud to-day the Leeites were making precisely the same claim. It looks as if the senatorial contest would develop into oue of the most ex? citing that has been witnessed in Vir? ginia for a long time. It would not be I surprising if there should be some de-' cidedly interesting developments by Monday night or Tuesday.?Jlichmond Stale, Saturday. John P. Hopkins was nominated by acclamation in the democratic city con? vention in Chicago ou Saturday evening to fill the vacancy caused by the assas? sination of Mayor Carter H. Harrison. 

FROM WASHINGTON. Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.] Washington. Dec. 4,1893. The second session, of the 53d Con? gress opened very quietly. Usually the entire Capitol is thronged with people when Congress meets, but to-day the visitors were not numerous, and half an hour before noon the galleries were scarcely more than half Oiled. In the Senate big banks of flowers on some of the desks were the most obtrusive ob? jects present. 3Ir. Hill, of New York, sat complacently reading the morning papers, while his colleague chatted with Senators from other sections of the country. The New York statesman was evidently feeling much better simg his rest, aud* said that he was in got d trim for the siege before Congress. He remarked that be had lost none of his zeal for an amendment to the rules of the Senate so that that body might be permitted to do business in an expedi? tious manner. He was quite confident the subject would receive the attention ot the Senat?. For the first time iu years it was found necessary to renew the top ot the desk of the Vice Presi? dent, and when the green baize oover ingwas removed, the top was found to be literally broken into minute splin? ters. Much of this wreckage was caus? ed during the recent silver debate, w hen the Vice-President was, perhaps, more than during any time in recent years, compelled to nse his gavel with great frequency and much force. The most striking Uor.il offerings, noticea? ble especially for their size and the magoificencs of their composition, were the baskets that reposed on the desks of Senator Stewart, one of the republi? can champions of free silver, of Mr. Harris, one of the equally strong cham? pions of the white metal from the South, and of Mr. McPherson, the champion of repeal from the East. Tbesa baskets were composed of huge American Beauty roses, carnations and Chrysanthemums. On the desk of Mr. Yoorhees reposed a gorgeous horse? shoe, emblematical ol the good luck his friends wish him, while ou the desk of Mr. Turpie was an artistic arrangement of the same kind" of flowers. In the House everybody had a greeting for everybody else. Republicans, dem? ocrats and populists alike scattered in groups about the chamber and laughed aud chatted, occasionally jesting with each other about the recent political upheaval in New York, Massachusetts and Ohio. Ex-Speaker Reed carried a copy of the amended tariff bill in his bands. He is looking less rotund than formerly. Mr. Burrows will make the opening speech on the republican side in opposition to the tariff bill. Mr. Wilson of West Virginia, who is, by virtue of his position as chairman of the ways and means committee, the leader of tho House, received a welcome that partook almost of the nature of a recep? tion. Jerry Simpson, the populist member from Kansas; Mr. Oates of Al? abama, the one-armed Confederate veteran and one of the strongest de? baters of the House; Mr. Pence, the boyish looking populist from Colorado : Mr. liourke Cocnran; Mr. Tracey of Albany, tho spokesman of the ad? ministration ; Mr. Allen of Missis? sippi, the raconteur of tho House; Mr. Holman, the watch-dog of the Treasury, aud many others equally well-known, were among the conspicuous figures ou the floor present at the fall of the Speaker's gavel. A miniature sheaf of oats, its edges trimmed with smilax aud surmounted by a white rose, lay ou the desk of the late Charles O'Neill of Pennsylvania, who died a week ago. In the U. S. Supreme Court to-day the appeal of the supervisors of Bruns? wick county, Virginia, against the de? crees of the circuit court and the court of appeals of Virginia, by which they .strove to prevent the collection of their county's subscription to the Atlantic and Danville railroad, was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The official estimates sent to Con? gress to-day by Secretary Carlisle ask for $411,879.041, for the fiscal year 1S95. as against ?421,612,215 for 1S94, and against S432,456,S2o', appropriated for 1S!>4. Among the visitors here to-day was Col. William Kilgour, formerly of Alex? andria. The Colonel has just been ap? pointed to an $1800 clerkship in the office of the collector of internal reve? nue for the Maryland district. Judge Thomas Smith, of the U. S. Court for New Mexico, is also here, looking well aud hearty. State Sena? tor Washington of Westmoreland coun? ty, and Delegates Pilcher of Fauquier county and llyan of Loudoun county, Va., are also here, on their way to Richmond, where the legislature of their State will meet next Wednesday. They are as much in the dark about the result of the U. S. senatorial elec? tion as any body else, but seem to think that Genera] Hunton will be elected for tho short, and General Lee or Mr. Martin for the long term. Senators Daniel and Hunton of Vir? ginia were both in the Senate to-day. In the House only four A'irginia mem? bers wore present when the roll was called?Messrs. Meredith, Swanson, Marshall and Tyler, Senator Danielj when asked how the senatorial fight in his State stoo 1, said the contest between Lee and Martin seemed pretty close. That also seemed to be the opinion of the Virginians in the House. A Virginian here to-day, on his way to Richmond, said that one of the slates for the new Court of Appeals of his State to be elected by the legislature, was as follows: Cardwell, Halsey, Mann, Barton and i'hlegar. A mau about 60 years of age appeared at Capitol this morning aud demauded that lie bo sworn in as a "second class Senator." He gave the name of Samuel Ames, and said he came from Vermont He was specially soli? citous about Senator Morrill and Vice Presi? dent Stevenson, and desired to know if they would have anything to do with his takii g the oath of office. The old man talked upon pMitics in an apparently rational manner, but was firm iu the belief .that he had been depu? tized by the people of his State to represent t 10m in the Senate. He was placed under ar i\ st. ami when a patrol wagon arriveil, wil? lingly entered the vehicle and accompanied the police to tho station house. Tho House Ways and Means Committjo met this morning. part of a comparative statement showing the chances bv tho new tariff bill was presented The remainder will be shown to-morrow. Chairman Wilson says the tariff bill will not bo reported to the House before ten days, and the internal reve? nue features of it, not until some time later. Articles of incorporation have been granted at Hagerstown. Md., to the Chesapeake and Ohio Transportation Company of Washington county. It is the purpose of this corporation to apply electricity as a motive power to the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, provided that the experiments with electricity, which are now being tried ou the Erie canal, in New York Statt, prove suc? cessful. The amount of the capital stock of the Maryland company is $250, 000. I THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Cleveland sent his annual message to Congress to-day. The fol? lowing is a synopsis: While our foreign relatious have not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity, no em? barrassing situation remains that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice, which, joined with con? sistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy. The outbreak: of domestic hostilities in the Republic of Brazil found the United States alert to watch the in? terests of our citizens in that country. Emphasizing our fixed policy of im? partial neutrality in such a condition of allairs as now exists, I deemed it necessary to disavow, in a manner not to be misunderstood, the unauthotized action of our late naval commander in those waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being indisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction tu the local insur? rection. The vexatious question of so-called legation asylum ior offenders auainst the Stale and its laws was presented anew in Chile by the unauthorized ac? tion of the late United States minister iu receiving into his official residence ttvo persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pending growing out of a former abortive dis? turbance. Under no circumstances can the representatives of this Govern? ment be permitted, to interrupt the ad ministration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are accredited. A temperate demand having been made by the Chilean Government for the correction of this conduct in the in? stance mentioned, the minister was in? structed no longer to harbor the of? fenders. Costa Rica has lately testified - its friendliness by surrendering to the United Slates, in the absence of a con? vention of extradition, but upon duly submitted evidence of criiniuality,a not? ed fugitive from justice. In my opinion treaties for reciprocal extradition .should be concluded with all those couutries with which the United States has not already conven? tional arrangements of that character. The questions allccting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliuess. Negotiations are iu progress between lue two gov? ernments with a view to such concur? rent action as will make the award aud regulations agreed upon by the Beh? ring Sea Tribunal of Arbitration prac? tically effective; and it is not doubted that Great Britain will cooperate freely with this country for the accomplish? ment of thai purpose. The Nicaragua Canal has, unfortu? nately, become financially seriously em? barrassed. The United Stales is es? pecially interested iu the successful achievement of the vast undertaking this company has iu charge. That it should "be accomplished under dis? tinctively American auspices, and its enjoyment assured not only to the ves? sels of this country as a channel oi communication between our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, but to the ships of the world in the interest of civili? zation, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit any question. Led by a desire to compose ditl'erences and contribute to the restoration of or? der in Samoa, the United States enter? ed four years ago into the treaty of Ber? lin, therefore becoming joiutly bound with England and Germany to estab? lish aud maintain Malietoa Laupepa as King of Samoa. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number of his native adherents were in open re? bellion on one of the islands. Mataafa was defeated and a number of his men killed. The defeated chief and ten of his principal supporters were deported to the Marshall group, where they were he'd as prisoners under the joint responsibility and the cost of three pow? ers. This incident and the events leading up to it signally illustrate the impolicy of entangling alliauces with foreign powers. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our re? lations with Hawaii have caused se? rious embarrassment. Just prior to the installation of the present administra? tion the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation bad been negoti? ated between the provisional govern? ment of the islands and the United States, and submitted to the Senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination, and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make nn im? partial investigation of the circum? stances attending the change of govern? ment, and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough aud exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that tho constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that govern? ment, aud through the intimidation caused by the preseuce of an armed naval force of the United States which was landed for that puposo at the in? stance of our minister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had beeu done by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our for? cible intervention. With a view of ac? complishing this result within the con? stitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed conditions brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our pres? ent minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no information of the accom? plishment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional advices are soon expected. When re? ceived they will be promptly sent to Congress accompanied by a special ex? ecutive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete under? standing of the case. By a concurrent resolution, passed by the Senate and by the House of Repre? sentatives the President was requested to invite negotiations with any govern? ment with which the United States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or dispules arising between the two governments which can not be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means. A response has been received from Great Britain in the shape of a resolution adopted by Parliament ex? pressing the hope that Her Majestv's government will lend ready cooperation t) the government of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent resolu? tion above mentioned, The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far-reaching. It is impossible to know, at this time, pre? cisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, il any, supplementary legislation may, in the light of such conditions, appear to be essential or expedient. Of course, afier the recent financial perturbation, timo is necessary for the reestablishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence the money which has been frightened iuio hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situa? tion will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently .-ound curren? cy, abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of increasing population and business. In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, instead of be? ing injurious, will increase the proba? bility of wise actiou. I desire to earnestly suggest the wis? dom of amending the existing statutes in regard to the inssuance of govern? ment bonds. The authority no vv vest? ed in the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds is uot as clear as it should be. aud the bonds authorized are dis? advantageous to the government both as to the time of their maturity aud rate of interest. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and the de? monstrated danger of the introduction of contagious diseases from foreign ports has invested the subject of na? tional quarantine with increased inter? est. A more general and harmonious system than now exists, acting prompt? ly aud directly everywhere, and con? stantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the invasion of disease, and at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I believe, add greatly to the safety of our people. The operation of wise laws and the iniluences of civilization constantly tending to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian hostilities, lead to the suggestion that the time is fast ap? proaching when there should be a re? organization ofourarmy. This change contemplates neither increase in num? ber nor added expense, but a redistri? bution of the force and an encourage? ment of measures tending to greater efficiency among the men and improve? ment ot the service. The adoption of battalion formations for infantry regiments, the strengthen? ing of the artillery force, the abandon? ment of smaller aud unnecessary posts, and the massing of the troops at im? portant and accessible stations, all promise to promote the usefulness of the army. The operation of the law forbidding tho re-enlistment of men af? ter ten years' service has not proved its wisdom, and the experience of the year constrains me to join in the re? commendation for its repeal. The manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs; but to render these guns available for the pur? poses they arc designed to meet, em? placements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made in this direc? tion, and it is desirable that Congress by adequate appropriations should pro? vide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this uecessary work. Afier nntcii preliminary work and exhaustive examination the board ap? pointed to select a magazine rille of modern type with which to replace the obsolete Springfield rille of the infautry service, completed its labors during the last year, and the work of manufacture is now in progress at the National Armory at Springfield. It is confident? ly expected that by the end of the cur-1 rent year our infantry will be supplied with a weapon equ'ai to that ot the most progressive armies of the world. The report of the Attorney General contains certain recommendations as to needed legislation on various subjects. I can not too heartily indorse the propo? sition that the fee system as appli? cable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts, and United States oom misssioners, should be abolished with as little delay as possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the business of the courts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively transacted as the ends of justice will allow. The system is there? fore thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of court officials de? pend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private gain, which can not fail to be danger? ous to the rights and freedom of the citizen and an irresistible temptation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If in addition fo this reform another was inaugurated which would give to United States commisnioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade of misdemeanors, es? pecially those coming under the inter? nal revenue laws, a great advauce would be made toward a more decent administration of the criminal law. I also heartily join the Attorney General jn recommending legislation fixing de? grees of the crime of murder within j federal jurisdiction, as has been done iu many of the States ; authorizing writs of error on behalf of the government in cases where final judgment is rendered against the sufficiency of an indictment or against the government upon any other question arising before actual trial; limiting the right of review iu cases of felony punishable only by fine and imprisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy provi? sion for the construction of such prisons and reformatories as may be necessary for the confinement of United States con nets. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a satisfactory account of the progress which has beeu made in the construction of vessels, and makes a number of recommendations to which attention is especially invited. While I am distinctly in favor of con? sistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient Navy, I can not refrain from the suggestion that the Congress should carefully take into account the number of unfinished vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of our Treasury in considering the pro? priety of an appropriation at this time to begin new work. The method of employing mechani? cal labor at navy-yards through boards of labor, and making efficiency the sole test by which laborers are employed and continued, is producing the best r3sults, and the Secretary is earnestly devoting himself to its development. j Although the law of 1890 permits' (pensions for disabilities not related to ; military service, yet as a requisite to ita ; benefits a disability mu^t exist iucapac i itating applicants "irotn the perform? ance of mauual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a sup? port." The discovery having hein made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the Commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthor? ized pending a complete examination. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed aud corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiments in which pensions have their origiu ; every fraudulent pension? er has become a bad citizen ; every false oath iu support of a pension has made perjury more common, and false and uuderserving pensioners rob the peo? ple not only of their money, but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a war, fought for the preservation > f the I'nion, ought to inspire. Thous? ands of neighborhoods have their well known fraudulent pensioners, and rt cent developments by the Bureau es? tablish apj.alliug conspiracies to ac? complish pension frauds. By no meaus the least wrong done is to brave and de? serving pensioners, who certainly ought not to be condemned to such associa? tion. Those who attempted in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should not be accused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest veterans. The condition of the Indians and their ultimate fate are subjects which arc related to a sacred duty of the Government, aud which strongly ap? peal to the sense of justice aud the sympathy of our people. I am sure that secular education and moral religious teaching must be im? portant factors in any effort to save the Indian and lead him to civilization. I believe, too, that the relinquishment of tribal relations and the holding of land in severally may, iu favorable condi? tions, aid this consummation. I especially commend to the atten? tion of Congress the statements con? tained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior concerning forestry. The time has como when efficient measures should be taken for the preservation ol our forests from indiscriminate and remediless destruction. The report of the Secretary of Agri? culture will be found exceedingly in? teresting to that large part of our cit? izens intimately concerned in agricul? tural occupations. Iu view of a depleted public treasury and the imperative demaud of the peo? ple for economy iu the administration of their government, the Secretary has entered upon the task of rationally re? ducing expenditures by the elimination Irotn the pay rolls of all persons uoi needed for an efficient conduct of the nllairs of the department. I join the Secretary in recommending that here? after each applicant for the position oi inspector or assistant inspector in the Bureau of Animal Industry be required to exhibit bis diploma from an estab? lished; regular and reputable veterinary college, aud that this be supplemented by such au examination iu veterinary science as the commission may prescribe, In each State and Territory au agri? cultural experiment station has been es? tablished. These stations are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; and yet the in? discriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation aud legislators continues, answering no purpose unless it be to re? mind constituents that their represent? atives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. I am, if possible, more than ever con? vinced of the incalculable benefits con? ferred by the civil service law. not only in its ellect upon the public ser? vice, but also, what is even more im? portant, iu its ellect in elevating the tone ol political life generally. It b -ems to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform, as well as with its best enforcement, to oblige the commission to rely for clerical assist? ance upon clerks detailed from other departments. It does not accord with a sensible view of civil service reform ih.it persons should bo employed on the theory that their labor is necessary in one department when in point of fact their services are devoted to entirely different work in another department. I earnestly urge that the clerks neces? sary to carry on the work of the com? mission be regularly put upon its ros? ter, and that the system of obliging the commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other depart? ments be discontinued. After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so important claims our at? tention and nothing so clear? ly presents itself as both au op? portunity and a duty. After full dis Olission our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have confided the work of its accomplish? ment to the bauds of those who are solemnly pledged to it. Nothing should intervene to distract our atten? tion or disturb our etl'ort until this re? form is accomplished by wise and care? ful legislation. If we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpable and substantial, seen and felt by thous auds who would be better feu and bet? ter clothed and better sheltered. Not less closely related toonr people's pros, perity and well-being is the removal of restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials necessary to our manu? factures. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enter? prise. This cannot be while Federal legislation, through the imposition of high tariff, forbids to American manu? facturers as cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products re Bnlting from this policy not only con? fines the market for these products within our own borders.to the direct dis? advantage of our manufacturers, but al? so increases their cost to our citizens. The interests of labar are certain I v, though indirectly, involved in this fea? ture of our tariff system. The competi? tion and active struggle among manufac? turers to supply the limited demand for their goods, soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension ol" work in milLs and factories, a discharge of employes, and distress in the h wies of our workingmc'n. Even if the often disproved assertion could l>c made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the in? telligence of our workingmen levis them quickly to discover that their steady employ? ment, permitted by free raw materials, is the most important factor in their relation to tariff legislation. I am satisfied that the re? duced tariff duties provided for in the pro; posed legislation, added to existing internal revenue taxation, will, in the near future, produce sufficient revenue to meet the neecs of tbe government. The committee to pro vide against a temporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country ad? justs itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few addition? al internal-revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain cor? porate investments. These new assessments are not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such in can be remitted without unfavorable busi? ness disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no lougor exists. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its success can only bo attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of taritl* re? form and as a result of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitions to the general good. The local interests affected by the proposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all are insisted upon the leg? islation embodying the reform must inevita? bly fail.
