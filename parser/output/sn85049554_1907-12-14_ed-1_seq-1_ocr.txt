I %:f fFF^ Iowa Retail Liquor Dealers'As sociation Insisting Mulct Law Shall Be Obeyed INLAND TOWNS START CRUSADE Liquor Dealers Who Obey Laws Notify Fliver Towns That They Must Do So Or Law Abiding Ones Will Join Temperance Crusade Shaw's Book Out in February. Special to Times-Republican. Des Moines, Dei'. 14.—The report that the officers of the Retail Liquor Dealers' Association are visiting the cities of Iowa and insisting to the saloon keepers that they get In line and obey the law was confirmed here today. The association has seen the hand writing on the wall. The meet ing some time ago in Dubuque, it: is iet.rned now, resolved on this plan and Dubuque was the first place whipped into line. The association proposes to force every saloon keeper In the state to obey the mulct law and to assist in prosecuting those that do not. The saloon keepers of the Inland towns are the prime movers in Ihe plan. They have decided to lay down the ultimatum to all the river town saloon keepers and that unless they "come in" and obey the law, the in land town saloon keepers, who have for years been obeying the mulct law, will join .the forces of the temper ance people and give them moral sup port in closing up such saloons. The inland saloon keepers fear that unless checked, the sentiment will re sult in the prohibitory amendment which the Anti-Saloon league and •ministers are working so vigorously for. it is learned that in Davenport the brewery interests own three-fourths ,of the saloons of that town. There are something like twice as many th'Sre as there are In Des Moines, thn Davenport is only half as large. These Davenport breweries have observed th-3 provisions of the mulct law, but the saloons that they own have not. This has led to the breweries being held up for many years by blackmail ing lawyers. They have paid hun dreds of dollars to keep these lawyers from starting court actions against them. Finally driven by desperation they organized a "holding company" to manage the saloons, so that the brew eries could not be hurt. In their management of their saloons the breweries have toeen forced to buy the property in which their saloons are located and this has been a big expense to them. Under the new plan the state association proposes that all Davenport saloons and .brew eries s.hall obey the mulct law and live up to all its provisions. This means that they must pay the mulct tax which they have never paid. The payment of this tax will result in about one-half the saloons going out of business and the breweries will have a lot of corner lots property for sale. A number of Davenport saloonkeep ers have decided to begin strict obedi ence to the mulct law at once and not wait any longer for threatened legal action. Ben Harloff was the first one to tile a $8,000 bond and the necessary papers with the county auditor. Others are preparing to do the same, and it is thought that within a very short time all will be obeying the law. Several incidents happened to has ten the saloon keepers to seek snel lor under the mulct law. One was the visit ofl the otficers of the Iowa Liquor Dealers' assocfition and their ultimatum that- unless the saloon keepers complied with the mulct law thoy would join forces with the tem perance element to bring it about, and that outride breweries would join in the movement. The organization of a local civic federation was completed by the elec tion of Rev. W. H. Blancke, pastor of St Paul's English Lutheran church, as president. *. Governor Shaw's book giving a de fense of his position as a standpat ter will not be out of the press till in February or March of next year. This information was learned today by a Des Moines book store where an order for the book had been lodged some weeks ago. The advertisements of the book stated that it was ready for dis tribution- This was in the November magazines. The book is not out yet and information from the publishers to the Des Moines book store is to the effect that it will not appear till February or later. Unofficial rumors are in circluation to the effect that the book is being held up because the times are not propitious for launching it. It is said that the book was to be issued as a sort of Mirier for a boom for Shaw for pres ident of tiie Tinted States. When it wis readv the political situation was not readv and the situation has not been readv since that time. Tile pub lishers wisli to launch it at a nine w'len thev will be able to make some money out of it for the book is to be circulated for profit and not gratis as wis the volume sent out by Vice President Fairbanks in which some important chapters relating to his wirk as an attorney for a bankrupt railroad were left out and afterward \,T'|k* FT jri-^isrwv» --estz A, T, I* '-7f: Aki supplied by a Washington, I C., muck raker, not with any view of doing Mr. Fairbanks any good. Progressive republicans in Iowa have for many months been intimating that the delegation from Iowa shall be tor some prou't'essivci While there has been little done In the way of laying plans yet there has been an understanding among the leaders and tluy have kept a finger on tile pulse of the situation continuously. Tills is not true ot Iowa alone hut Is true of every state in the west. The information that leaks out here Is proof that the west Is aroused and determined that there shall be no reactionary nominated by the party next June is they can prevent it. It is proposed here I11 Iowa to Ret the dele gation for Cummins and the chances are that in many of the other states of the west Cummins delegations will be I secured. When the convention is held .these western slates will all be in line for a. progressive of pronounced type.
