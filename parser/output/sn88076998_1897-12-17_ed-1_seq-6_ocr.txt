Washington, Deb. 8. The nnnual report of the secretary of the treasury, sent to congress' Tuesday, shows that the total receipts for -the year ended June 30,:1S97, \vere $430,378,167, and the expend itmres $448,439,022, leaving a de ficit of $18-,052,4S4. The receipts of the year, however, exceeded those for the year 1896 by $20,911,759. The customs, it is shown, yielded $176,554,126, and internal The Cncrencjr. Secretary Gage calls attention to what ho term* "'the menace to the public credit oc casioned by the continued use of the large' volume of demand liabilities, represented by the legal tender notes," and says that the enormous depreciation In the commer cial value of silver as compared with gold has greatly Increased the financial respon sibilities of the government In its demand liabilities, and all the logical consequences of the fact should be boldly faced. The 'advantages of a strong position In the national treasury, with Its accompany ing 'benefits to all. commercial interests and great reinforcement to the public «redlt, can, I: believe, be secured without any unsettling legislation In a manner easy to be comprehended by all and with small cost to the people. The recommendations I make must be construed as tentative stops in a direction Which, if consistently pursued, will ulti mately lead to conditions theoretically desirable rather than as being In them selves final measures to that end. The con dition of the treasury In Its relation to de mand obligations requires that one of two steps be taken. The one may-be a large re inforcement of the permanent gold re serve the other may be by an important reduction in the objectionable form of lia bilities. The latter is. In my opinion, the more desirable. Recommendations. First I recommend that proper legisla tion be enacted which will establish, sep arate and apart from the ordinary opera tions of the treasury as they relate to rev enue and expenditures, a department to be designated and known as the issue and re demption division. To this division the sum of .1126,000,000 in gold should be set over from the general fund In the treasury, to be used only for redemption purposes, and all the silver dollars now held for re demption of silver certificates, and all the sliver bullion and dollars coined therefrom, bought under the act of 1890, should be passed to the same account. Further, that the sum of $200,000,000 in the legal tei.der I notes of the United States known as -een backs be collected as hereinafter, described and deposited In the said Issue and. re demption division, to be disbursed there from only upon the receipt In exchange therefor of an equivalent.amount of gold coin. Such gold, when so secured, to be held in said division as part of the general redemption fund. Second. I recdmmend that .provision be made for the Issue of refunding loan bonds, payable after ten years at the pleasure of .the government, such bonds to bear In terest at the rate of 2& per cent per an num. payable, principal and Interest, In gold coin and that the secretary of the' treasury^be authorised to.ifeaue such bonds and receive In payment therefor, with an equitable allowance for the difference In interest and part or all of the outstanding oans of the United States which mature by' their terms of payment in the years 1904 1907 and 1925. Would Strengthen Onr Credit. .. The advantage Involved in the proposed action lies In this: It removes an am biguity from our contract obligations—an ambiguity which affects unfavorably the government credit. The word "coin," now used to express the obligation In the public' debt. Is an ambiguous word. Tt Is no doubt understood by the more discriminating public creditor to mean gold coin, and the solemn act of congress pledging the main tenance of silver coin upon a parity with gold coin makes It Impossible to construe the word "coin," as therein used, to mean anything other than gold or Its full equivalent. Yet as this Is a conclusion of logic rather than a clear statement of fact, the simpler or more humble Inventors or wntild-be Investors In the public debt are confused and doubtful, and the public cred it is the weaker therefor To refund our outstanding bonds now payable In coin Into bonds payable In gold would strengthens and confirm the public credit and put ti* In a position to command tl»e markets of the world for our Securities on the most advantageous terms Bank Note Circulation.

Permit nstlonal hanks to be. or ganised with minimum'capital of S2h,nno In any place having a population of 2.000 inhabitants or less. 8econd. Reduce the rate of taxation on circulating notes secu«d :by. deposit of bonds to one-half of one per cenr per an num Thtnl. Permit bank^.nn* organised or hereafter or«anlied to I*su* "Irctiinting, notes to. the par vattfe'^Wf therrefiindlng bonds- hereinbefore niigeested. when de posited with the treasurer of the United States: and. further, allow such banks as slpall avail themselves of the opportunity to' deposit with the treasury of the United Slates greenbacks, treasury notes or -all v»r certificates to a total amount of 1200.- Beside this OftKOOO, against which there shall at once gigantic machine all telescopes as Vet b# Issued to them hy the comptroller of lncxtstenmnlll uom m.» the currency national bank notea to an 'BWBSie^eowiU seem us mere pigmies, equal amount.

To sccure the government against loss, if any, attaching to its guaranty, a .tacX.'of two per cent, per annum on unse cured circulation shall be levied to create a safety, fund, which fund shall be Invested by the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller of the currency In government bonds..

The control of such re demption shall be under the direction of the comptroller of the currency and made from a redemption fund of ten per cent., to be provided and maintained by the banks. Eighth, Restrict the issue of national bank notes to the denomination of ten dol lars and upward. ?A Twofold Problem. The problem Is a twofold one: How to withdraw the specific form of security now provided, since It will ultimately disappear how to provide a substitution which will be recognized by the people as adequate se curity, and which will at the same time allow "to banks within well-guarded limits the most useful freedom In their note is sues. .The problem Is too large, its results too far-reaching, to be solved offhand or by. expert dictum. Its solution must be gradually reached by the path of safe ex periment. To-allow national banks to issue circulating notes equal to 25 per cent, of their capital upon a payment of two per cent per annum as an Insurance or safety fund upon amounts.so Issued Is, if the dem onstration drawn from the comptroller's office can bq trusted, a proposition well within the limits of safety. Nevertheless, whatever risk there Is should be assumed by the government, obnoxious as it may be to the general principles of governmental action It Is by such action that the situ ation as It exists has been evolved. Upon the government, therefore, rests the duty of seeing it properly solved. Some years of experience along the line suggested will prove what Is an adequate tax for the se curity of noteholders and will allow Such amendments.as time will Justify, Involving as one of Its features a. complete with drawal of the government's guaranty from bank note Issues.
