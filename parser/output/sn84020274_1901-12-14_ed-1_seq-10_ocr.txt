KiimsL PROTECT WELLS FROM FIRE Beaumont Oil Men Insist On All Owners Employing Watchmen. ItEPCBMC SPECIAL. Beaumont. Tex.. Dec. 12. Judge J. D. Martin of the Fifty-eighth District Court Is determined that Splndletop shall be pro tected from Jlre. as far a3 the laws of the State will permit. Representatives of the Safety Committee went before Judge Mar tin this mi .mine, and informed him that many of the companies having wells on the hill had refused to pay tne assessments made against them by the committee, for the protection of the hill. Secretary Chil dress of the Beaumont O.l Exchange was the spokesman of the delegation that vis ited Judge Martin, and he Informed the Judge that it was the desire of the com mittee that the owners of each well be re quired to Keep a watchman at such well. and that it be part of the duty of such watchman to see that no other well Is en dangered from the one he may be watch ing. The matter was discussed at some length, and Judge Lipscomb of the com muiee reid an amendment offered to the injunction v.hich was granted to George W. Carroll some months 00 against all com panies on the hill. The amendment re uuires that each comoanv owning a well shall guard that well at all times, and that the guards shall do such work as shall protect surrounding property also. It fur ther provides that If a. company prefers to contribute to the payment of the Safety Committer's employes, it shall be relieved from maintaining a private watchman. Judge JIartin announced that the Safety Committee should not be disbanded, and that he would make the amendment a part cf the Injunction. A telegram from the fuel Oil and Tran sit Company of Mobile.

New Australia as a field for the writer of fiction should te fertile In local color, stir ring Incident, and the novelty that comes from general Ignorance as to actual condi tions In that far-off country. Strange to say. there have been few books written with Australia as the scene. Perhaps this charge can be laid against any compara tively new country. Edward Dyson Is perhaps best known for hN work dealing with Australia. Hi1? "Rhymes From the 3Iines" and "Below and on Top" show that he confine himself to writing about that with which he Is acquainted. In his last bcok, "The Gold Stealers, a Story of Wnddy," hr has not de parted from his own b-aten track, but has further fstablished himclf as the deplcter of Australian characters and life. And he has done thH so successfully In Tho Gold Stealers" that he justilies hi choice. There are types en this antipodal continent that are interesting to even the casual reader. The thoroughness with which 3Ir. Dyson tells of their life, while at the same time sotting forth the mest en livening and thrilling tale. Instructs the reader by entertaining him. Waddy Is a small mining town In Vic toria. The population Is cosmopolitan. If nothing else. There Is the pure-bred Eng lishmen, the hearty Irishman, the bro.ul speken Scotchman, the bushranger, the Chinaman, and the score or more other types. Ia bringing these people Into his GILBERT P.VRKER. Author of "The Right of Way." story the author has used a consummate art that preserves the characteristics of each nationality In its primitive form. The book opens with an Introduction to two of the chief characters Dick Haddon and Joel Ham. Dick Is the hero of the ex citing adventures that have him as the center. He la the only son of a widowed mother. It must be confessed that he is a most provoking youngster for a 12-j ear old. He is the leader of the "gang." re sourceful, imaginative to a degree, not al ways conforming to strict ideas of right and wrong, but alwavs managing to keep In the limelight of publicity. Joel Ham is the schoolmaster of Yt'addy. In describing the characteristics of this most surprising Individual, the author grows almost to tho Dickens standard. "Hamlet," as his pupils called him. is the smartest man In Waddy, as he should be. So necessary is he to the mental equipment of the place that the school trustees in hir Irg him permit him a limited quantity of liquor without which he is unable to pursue his dally vocation. During school hours he has his bottle at hand. Tho pupils see nothing strange In the fact that he should stop recitations long enough to refresh him self behind the raised lid of his desk. There is comment only at the amount that he takes. For many years the gold mines In Waddy had been robbed In a, mysterious manner. One man had been sent to the prison on circumstantial evidence. Still the robbing continued. And as it chanced, the dishon est "searcher' of the mines the man who had sent an Innocent man to prison Is the father of the girl whom the harum scarum Dick Haddon looked upon as little less than a heavenly being. Around this characteristic of every 13-year-old boy this predilection for worship ping some young woman the author weaves a story that does not lag in interest at any stage. The schemes of young Dick are wonderful. He It i3 who has taken charge of an abandoned mine where he directs his playmates in digging for a "strike." The fantastic names that he bestows upon his comrades are worthy the imagination of an older man but Dick is no ordinary boy. In the course of Dick's adventures he devises a scheme for stealing the goats of a neighboring mining village. Au-tralia revels in goats.. no less so than Ireland. With a bond of five companions, ho de scends upon the back yards- of his ene mies In Cow Flat at midnight. With tricks and calls, which only a boy knows, he drives all tho goats to Waddy. Then follows tho famous battle between the elders of Waddy and Cow Flat. It ii a battle royal. The blocd of the two min ing camps Is at fever heat. From a prank cf the boys the elders have entered into a serious agreement to disagree. The au thor teils of the battle on the outskirts of Waddy with rare skilL The native humor which is flashed in every lino of the description of this scene Is alono worth the writing of the book. English authors have a habit of making their boy heroes do most wonderful things. Kipling. In "Stalky and Company," is per haps an exaggeration of the English ten dency. Xo boy ever acted as does 31r. Kip ling's Stalky. Mr. Dyson, in one way, has followed along the same line, but with a greater degree of appreciation of boy char acter. Dick Haddon Is a human creation with characteristics common to every hap py and Independent youth of his age. No reader will regret the time spent In reading "The Gold-Stealers." The unrav eling of the plot Is done with skill, the mystery being sustained to the end. Mr. Dyson has reason to command the atten tion of the public to his work in his chosen field. Otner !tw Books. A superb photogravure portrait of Ben jamin Harrison forms the frontispiece to the volume complied by Mary Lord Harri son, entitled "Views of an Ex-President." and published by the Bowen-Merrill com pany.
