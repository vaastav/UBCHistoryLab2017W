We were told yesterday by the As sociated ress dispatches that Sena tor Foraker of Ohio has introduced bills In the senate vhlch prolJes for the admission of Loth New .Mexico and Arizona as separate states. Thus we are assured thai the distinguished -91 senator of Ohio has not been changed to his desire to, do Justice toj-thejpjo-file of the remaining territories. . Arizona,, wifi always retain a klnd- Iy feeling for Senator Foraker he- - cause of his determined fight made for Arizona at tho time President j Roosevelt, Speaker Cannon, Senator tsevenage and tne enure Roosevelt administration was trying to force us Into joint statetiood with Kew Mexico. Senator Foraker clfered the amend ment and compelled Its acceptance in the senate "which gave to the people of Arizona the right and opportunity to kill the joint, statehood proposition which was promptly- done. v. "Whether there Is to be opposition i. to the admission of, Arizona now, de spite the promise of the republican national - convention made Jnst sum mer in.' Chicago remains yet to be seen. A report has reached Arizona to the effect that Senator Beerldge will again oppose the admission of the territories. If 'he bhould do so, of course. It will be impossible to pass, the" measure over hte" opposition dur ing the short session of congress, as he holds the commanding position of chairman of the coiwnlttee on terrl- torieH In tKe'senate. Since congress ise. there has not been a single expression yet to give "hope that those who fought tLe admis- sion of Arizona asu separate state in the past will not continue to do so in the future, escept trat of President Roosevelt and he seems to be becom ing more disliked by the present con - grcbs every day. .

RAILROADS " " 1 AND SHIPPERS. . - When railroads were arbitrary dnd arrogant violent language concerning them was natural and pardonable. Now that they are changing tticir manners and methods and arb treat ing customers with some measure ot civility such language is out ot place. It is a belated echo of the fierce talk of earlier years and answers no good I purpose. The change In the attitude of the ra'lroads is Illustrated ,by what has happened during the, last year. Soon after the panic there came a great slump in their earnings. Once they saw in the raising cf freight rates a way out of their difficulties. Once they would have raised them offhand and let the shippers protest. This year the great eastern trunk lines adopted a different course. Ttey gave notice of their intention to raise freight rates 10 per cent. - There was an immediate remonstrance from shippers. It was energetic and orsanized and tho roads heeded 1L They postponed the pro posed Increase and talked of 7 per cent Instead of 10. They said ttiey were ready to discuss the subject wltn shippers. They said they wished to educate the public so that It could see the roads should be allowed to charge more. Then they rot down to a pro posed 3 per cent raibe Hor judging from what Vice President Brown ot the New York Central said at the; dinner of the Illinois Manufacturers' association, the roads are about ready talcave rates as they are. The roads would not have" been so amenable to argument and protest If It had not been f:r the steady im provement In their business. It weak. cited, month by inttith. the strength of their contention that rates should be, raised. Making full allowance for that, their course has been moderate and reasonable compared with what it would have been if they had felt themselves the masters of the law and the people they once thought them selves. , Now that the railroads arc begin ning to recognize shippers as equals, with rights that must be respected, the hope of the establishment of ami cable relations between them grows stronger. Intemperate remarks do not assist In establishing such re.a tions and should be discountenanced. The shippers have better -neaiwns than hard words. They hae the law end public sentiment with them. If they shall act in unison, as they have been doing cf late, the railroads will not court a war with them. .

Mt, Nmo hm iV COUGH Whoipg Coup THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW," ABOUT ADVERTISING NO. 8 The Cellar Hole and the Sewer Hole By Herbert Kaufman. A coal cart stopped before an office building in "Washington and the driver dismounted, removed the cover from a manhole, ran out his chute, and pro ceeded to empty the load. An old negro strolled over and stood watching him. Suddenly the black man , glanced down and immediately burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter, which continued for several minutes. The cart driver looked at him in amusement. "Say, Uncle,"v he asked, "do you always laugh when you see coal going into a cellar?" The negro sputtered around for a few moments and then holding his hands to his aching sides managed to say, "No, salt, but I jest Bnsts wlten I sees it goin' down a sewer." The advertiser who displays lack of judgment in selecting the newspapers which carry his copy often confuses the sewer and the cellar. All the money that is put into newspapers isn't taken out again by any means. The fact that all papers possess a certain physical likeness doesn't by any means signify a similarity in character, and it's character in a newspaper that brings returns. The editor who conducts a journalistic sewer finds a different class of readers than the publisher who respects himself enough to respect his readers. What goes into a newspaper largely determines the class of homes into which the newspaper goes. An irresponsible, scandal-mongering, muck-raking sheet is logically not supported by the buying classes of people. It may be perused by thousands of readers, "but such readers are seldom -purchasers of advertised goods. It's the clean-cut, steady, normal-minded citizens who form the bone and sinew and muscle of the com- ' munity. It's the sane, self-respecting, dependable newspaper that enters their homes and it's the Jwme sale that, indicates the strength of an advertising medium. No clean-minded father of a family wishes to have his wife and children brought in contact with the most maudlin and banal phases of life. He defends them from the sensational editor and the unpleasant adver tiser. He subscribes to a newspaper which lie does not fear to leave about Hie house. Therefore, the respectable newspaper can always be counted upon to produce more sales than one which may even own a larger circulation but whose distribu tion istin ten editions among unprofitable citizens. You can no more expect to sell goods to people who haven't money than you can hope to pluck oysters from btisltes. It isn't the number of readers reached but the number of readers whose purses can be reached that constitutes the value of circulation. It's one thing to arouse their attention, but it's) a far different thing to get tlteir money. The mind may be willing, but tlie pocketbook is weak. If you had the choice of a thousand acres of desert land or a hundred acres of oasis, you'd select the "fertile spot, realizing that the larger tract had less value because it would be less productive. Just so the advertiser who really understands howhe is spending his money does not measure by bulk alone. He counts -productivity first. He takes care that he is not putting his money into a sewer.
