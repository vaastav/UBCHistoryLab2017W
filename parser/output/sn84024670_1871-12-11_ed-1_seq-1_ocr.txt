UK DUTIES AMD RESPONSIBILITIES OF MEMBERS OF THE Kl-.PrHI.ICA N Every member of the Republican party as the Unquestioned right, and it is more* ver his duty, to advocate the nomination or office of those men whom he be re best fitted for the place. Thus, the icre fact that Carl Schurz is opposed to he renomination of President Grant does tot impair his standing within the Repub ican organization. There would be no ced of holding a convention at all, if every member was bound beforehand to support ie retionmialion of a particular man or icket. Therefore, men may be anti-l irant id be precisely as good Republicans ose who are advocating his renominatio lis proposition is weil understood, and lly allude to it to point mil in what inai er it is abused. The opposition to the renomination o irant must be conducted in such a manne s not to prevent the minority from gi. in im, if he should be nominated, their cor al support. The man who declares vance, as Garl Schurz seems to hat ne, if correctly reported, that he will in pport Grant in any event; or he Win intemperate in his opposition to the norn ation of (irant that he cannot give him rordial or efficient support in case he shouli I nominated, is placing himself in oppos 11 to the party, and the sooner he cease be recognized as a member the better c usage of submitting to regularly mad ninations is necessary to the existence of political parties anil cannot be dispense! h, and while I regret that any person iuld feel so great a resentment towards President of the United States that ho mid prefer to cooperate with the Demo te, the sooner his position is known th ter for all.

MATTERS. A RirMAHKAHi.i: Family Picture— The Father, Mather and Eleven Grown Children. —We have recently been shown a picture of the family group of Emanuel Semon, deceased, who, for more than forty yean, was the honored draml Steward and Tyler of the Grand Lodge of Masons of \ irginia. Mr. Souion's high respectability aiid his well-known character in Richmond lends a strong interest in the group before us. He was the father of seventeen chil dren by one wife, eleven of whom are still living and grown ; all of whom are engaged actively in different characters of business. Of the eleven living children, seven are daughters and four sons. Of the former, throe arc still single, and of the latter, two \ are single. Two sons and two daughters | are now residing in Philadclpha, where it ! will be remembered, the aged father died a I short time ago. Mr. Semon was a native I if Amsterdam, Holland, and emigrated to j his country about the year 1820. Not ! he least interesting feature of the picture j i that of a faithful servant boy owned i nd raised by Mr. S., whose name "is .lames I ' aylor.

Mr. Semon, the deceased, will be pleas ntly remembered by every member of the I lasonic fraternity who were in the habit f attending the meetings of the Grand A)dge of this State. His life and example | re well worthy the imitation of the youth i I" the land, and we commend them to their j ■nsideration.

There is also great complaint of the scar | city qt coal obtained from the Chesterfield | pits, is evident there is a great lack of sys tem on the part of either the dealers or those who furnish them, as at times it is almost impossible to obtain a load of soft coal.
