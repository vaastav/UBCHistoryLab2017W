Letters on basinets should net be addressed to the Editor, but always to The Fbejs Pesss AasocUTio.i. The Preident"s message is received throughout the country with a general sen timent of heart v arnroval. It in felt to be not only a strung and sagacious, but a shrewd and iopnlar paper. The President's racccss is conclusively tiovvn bj the unusual decency of tbe Democratic press. They have found few joints which they could even travesty inti subject? of unfavorable criticism. The time is not probably for distant when, " in the natural course of events," says Presi dent Grant, the European political connec tion with this continent 'will cease. Our roller should be shared in view of this pro; Ih0ity, so as to ally the commercial inter' est of the Spanish American ' States more cjoelv to our own, and thus give the I ni ted States all the pre-eminence and all the advantages which Mr. Monroe, Mr. "Adams, and Mr. Clay contemplated when they pro posed to join in the Congress of Panama." This reference to the Congress of Panama, a body or which few men of tbe present gen eration ever beard, indicates what tbe Vtea dent is thinking of. He would bring all the American nations together, after tbe man ner in which some of the statesmen of five-and-furty years ago thought of bringing them together. The matter fell through then, owing to many causes, chief among which was the opposition made to it by tbe Jackson ty, which waa then forming. It remains to be seen if tbe present is a more auscions time for a grand alliance of Amer ican powers. The last leader of the jV. Y. Independent on the question of divorce, is not in all resets as definite as it might be ; but we understand it to be substantially a reaffirm ation of tbe position once before taken by Mr. Tilton that unc-mgmia'tiy should Ic suificient ground for divorce. The naked deformity of this propositon, it is true, is BHnewhat veiled. The Independent however, does say that it is " shallow " " to sty with tbe Roman Church, that there shall be no divorce, not even for fleshly lust ; or, with tbe Episcopal, no divorce ex cept for just this, and this only ; or, with the Presbyterian, no divorce except for this and for desertiou ; or with the Methodist missionary boardx, no divorce except for there and for litMtberjiem : or, with the civil law- of some of our states, no divorce except for n few of tbe more common and hideous offences which daily report themselves to our courts."' None of the civil laws which grant divorce for but " a few" causes are sari-factory to the Independent. Tbe limi tation mo-t be altogether broader than the csietint; laws, even where divorce is loosest. 1 1 mint he so broad, if we read the Independent aright, that the marriage tie shall bind no one who does nut choose to be bound by it. If tin"-) is not what the Indrpendent means, will it be good enough to say what. 131 to 110 since Gen. Grant became presi dent, and a continuance of the same policy must, at no distant day, make the green back the equivalent of specie. As regards the tariff, neither ultra protectionists nor freetraders should demand or expect their extreme opinions to bo adopted. Soinc com mon ground sliould be sought where exist ing burdens may be lightened and the great interests of the country eared for. The Senator continues: I'.cfurm in the civil service, by which the work of the government shall be more faithfully and thoroughly performed, and by which there shnll he less corruption in the different departments of public employment and greater purity in elections, is another ob ject which has received, and is destined to receive, more of the attention of the Ad ministration than has hitherto been custo mary. Tbe l'cpnblic&n party cannot, of course, go far ahead of the public sentiment in legis lation, and if, therefore, it docs not wiihto lower its standard, it must educate the peo ple upward. Education should be inculca ted in every party platform, and become the object not only of individual and associated effort on the part of all public spirited Kc publicons, but of appropriate legislation. The Ilurcau ol Education should be strength ened, and -Mr. Hoar's bill for the establish ment of a system of national education, or something tantamount thereto, should re ceive the immediate attention oi t,uugtra and the undividid support of Republicans. finally the duty, which Republican gen erally will not que-tion, is urged, of keeping out of power the Itemocratic party and its fmi-rcbellious adherents, North and south None who correct! gauged the issues of the Rebellion can lail to deprecate as a national calamity the return to power of the party which nurtured within !ts ranks the wen who raised aloft the arm ol treason, and came so near to rending asunder the I nion itself the parry that never gave the nation hearty support in its struggles with traitors, and hog never concealed its sympathy with them when overthrown. The Chinese bunigration. We quoted the other day the statements of Mr. Palmer of Boston about the Chinese as house-servants. Another communication in the Adeertistr, which we infer to lie from his pen, says that there are about one thous and Chinamen plantation hands in the South, at work in the States ot Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Of these, but three hundred signed contracts, in China ; the balance are from San Francisco. Besides these there arc, perhaps, two thousand five hundred men at railroad work in Tennessee, Alabama and Texas, none of whom contracted in China, and Mr. Kooputanschoup lias one contract, to 'Kcw Senator Wilson on the Departure" Hon. Henry Wilson of Massachusetts con tributes to tbe Atlantic Monthli for January, vi bieh it already out, a noticeable article on" Tbe new departure ofthe Republican jarty." Mr. Wilson is shrewd obserft i o! the driit of American polities. ian of princijJc and keeping gre.u rrinciles almost always in view, he by n i uicar,- 1 -e- sight of questions of cipedn nev and p ipu larity and availability . and no nmn makes fewer mistakes in judging what is likely to tie popular, available, and politically expe dient. He is not a fault-finder, or prp!.et of evil. He can almost alw.v1- di-cour plenty of signsof g'lod in the situation, e jecially while his own party in the n eendent ; and though njt a luvv--r 1 ri i, lew professional advocates more readily ni.tre ciate the " telling" facts and p nt- in any case which he makes his own, or an t 1 t'iciii forth more effectually. Th.- .'.-.icle 1 l.i, however, looks forward ra'.lier tl..ia liaek ward. It is not a defence or a glon!ieation if fin pait record of the Iicp-.'.hcari arty, but a thoughtful attempt to answer tie Question, how shall the Republican party continue to maintain its ground and accom plish the grand objects or its mission ? In point of fact, says Mr. "Wilson, the liovern- mentwasa desputi-m up to the time of the rebellion, the only optiou given to the jieoplc lieing that of choosing !ctween two nation al parties', both of whieli were nearly alike obsequious to tlie Southern rule. Hut now Ihc king is dead and his secptrc is broken, who shall take his place? Some new usurp er ? Or will the people, learning wisdom from their past fearful history, reduce to practice the theory of self-government so long and so inconsistently held ? Considering the points of danger, Mr. Wilson thinks that too many of his country men merit Bismarck's cenKurc of the French people, that they were far more ready to claim their rights than to perform their duties. lie allude to the growing dangers Irom the influence of wealthy corporations. The Eric Kailroad has 25,(MHI employes, and its stocks and bonds amount to $101,935,000. Two other railroad corporations liatc equal wealth, and ominous evidence of the un scrupulous use of their power is supplied by recent elections and State Legislatures. Thee deleterious influences occur at tbe same time with a vast cxteusion of suffrage to the freodmcn, just emerged from chattle hood. Education, therefore, becomes of momentous importance. .Senator Wilson con siders the two great noces-ities of the coun try at the present time to be " unification and education," the removal of everything calculated to promote sectional strife and animosities : and the elevation of the igno rant voters everywhere, to a knowledge and exercise of their rights, powers and duties as men and as citizens. As for the Republican arty, its first great duty is administration. Intrusted by the nation with the seals of ndiec and sceptre of power, it is responsible for their faithful use. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments must not lie permitted to lie a dead letter in the Constitution. As the South, for two gene rations, made the most of the compromises in the interests of slavery, the Republicans should exhibit equal energy in using these guarantees of human rights in the interests of freedom. With regard to financial measures, Sena tor Wilson thinks there is little need of other action than to leave the laws of trade and the existing legislation to work out their legitimate results. Gold has settled from and men to go to Kansas. There are, or will be very soon, about five thousand Chinamen cast of the Roc ky Mountains, only three hundred ot whom came from China direct, the remainder being hired in San Francisco, as any other operatives might have been. This is nut a large number, not enough to excite any great alarm or to war rant any political party in binding for the Chinese vote. The Chinese, tbe writer sais, prefer rail road work to any other. Indeed, it is very difficult to get them to contract for planta tion labor. They have heard the fearful tales of tbe abuse of their countrymen in Cuba and Peru, and have an indefinite idea that planters arc necesxarily Jiard task-mas ters. On the Pacific coast, t.'hinesc are more rJentv. and are receiving a eood deal of Dublic attention ; much is done to civilixe them and Christianize tl.em : and here where most effort to this eai ought to be laid out, as their landing place and tor the pres ent at least their principal residence. A letter from San Francisco in ti e New York Trdune savs : HundrMs of Chinese are getting daily instruct:: n n missions and private schools. About of them have private tutor. At lenst 'J.iJOO arc being well educated in the I'ami lit! where they live a servants. Another l.OlO are educating themselves as they best cm. Upward of 1.41 1 are receiving religioas instruct ion every San-ity in the various schools of the Christian churches, such as lr. Stone's and Dr. Sctxlder'H. Ox Presbyterian daily mission school for them, under the Rev. Mr. Loomis, is in fall operati . The Methodists are just fin ishing a college for them that will embrace all the departments of a complete literary and re ligions edneation. The General Assembly cf the Presbyterian Church is going to build another college, on a most extensive scale, that will pro vide for the literary and religions wants of the Chinese on Use Pacific Coast. Many of these Mission Sunday-schools for the Chinese have for their superintendent and teachers editors, lawyers, merchant, and bank era of the highest standing, and ladies ofthe 1 hichest order of edacation, refinement, an i -iciil rusitii n M-r Colde and ef.cr 1 1 i;i - are lookinc aft r t';e edu' i n f the I mise wi-nien and female ch .Iren In- 1 1 rttry L 1 I ie!, I ut it will re aee-.n-ph4- ie-1 in t...i -. - i dur-e wo.!

It is of little uso to prophecy in theso days, when the march of events out strips the flight of the imagination. The Civil Service Reform. The suljcet of competitive examinations for tfie civil service will undoubtedly come up for discussion very soon in Conjrcss. In the course of his last annual report the Secretary of the Treasury says : I am fully convinced that any marc perma nent tenure cf office would materially impair the efficiency cf the revenue sjstera There are many thousand men ercplojed in the customs and internal revenue strvice, and however care ful the preliminary examination might be, tbe evils which now impair the efficiency would un doubtedly exist That is to say, it will be difficult if not impossible, to have the proper men put in the x roper places, and difficult to get an im pnxr person out of a place he has once got. Rut the great fault with the present way or doing things is, not so much that in efficient men get into office as that everybody thinks there must be a chango of offices with every new administration to reward political serv ices, which operates as a constant dis couragement and renders all attempts at qualification for promotion abortive. No general examination can ever be ef fectual in testing the fitness of a candidate for a particular employment. Nothing but actual trial can do that. A man may be a good mathematician, and a good classical scholar, and yet be entirely lacking in the necessary qualifications for the xrforn"lI";e of the routine vvoik of a public office. It is nevertheless true that a sjstem which re quired a rigorous examination of the quali fications of candidates for employment in the civil service, would lw much more likely to secure good officers than a system which did not ; and the advantage gained lor the coun try in having 6uch a system would be much more in overthrowirg the doctrine that to the victors belong the spoils, and the present demoralizing system of distributing offices. We can never hope to I free from the dis graceful wrangle for ' spoils" which follows each chango of administration, until sou e such reform is introduced. While the final test of actual experience should always 1 applied, and no person allowed to stay in nn office who proves himself unfit, even it he has s&ed an examination, it would secure for trial men of at least average intelligence and learning, who soon could and would tit themselves for the place they might hold ; and would prevent suclioccurrcncffas the fol lowing, which we fiud related iu a New York paoer : Our tariff used to admit animals free of duty when they were imported fur breeding purposes, and an attempt navine bean made at the Cus tom House, one day, ti obtain a free permit for a donkey, so imported, the Deputy Collector re fused it on the ground that a dank was a mule. Th Collector was atwaaled to, bet he had to confess that he did not know what a donkey was, except figuratively speaking, and there wa not an official in the Custom Horn who did. The dictionaries were consulted and the only one that afforded any information was Worcester, unabridged, who says that a donkey is a mule or an ass. Everybody might be supposed capa ble of telling what oakum means, jet, when Mr. Toneer was Seeretarr of the Navv he had an idea that oakum was) the material out cf which ropes were manufactured ; and it is not long since that an expert in the Custom House in sisted on putting ten per cent, discriminating duty on someoskam imponea mm Lionaon, on the arnmnd that it was arown in countries east of the Cape of Good Hope : and half adosen of his fellow clerks restaiaed him in his deoaion. If any candidate for competitive examination had proved himself so ignorant on to simple a subject it would doubtless have proved fatal to his hopes for an appointment. It is now generally acknowledged that governments are not made, but grow, it seems very difficult for men to learn that great political parties are formed, if at all, under a similar law. They grow, Iwt are not made to order. Every once in a few months si me company of erlf-stylcO reform ers gather in convention, and say " Oo to, let ue have a new "party." The ungrateful public, irom which the members of the new party ate to be drawn, pay no heed to the call, but pursue tbe even tenor of their way in spite of the invitations and maledictions of disappointed reformers. Some w.cks ao a few members of tbe republican party persuaded themselves that tbe time had come for forming a new party. They gave expression to their ideas through several journal. They took the ground that the republican party bad been organis ed to meet a special exigency, and that the exigency no longer existed, and so there was no further occasion f jr the party. They pro posed to base the new party on the ideas of free trade and revr out reform. They hoped Henry Orr, cf North Adams, Mass., shot and fatally wounded a young man named Curtis.who, wilh a companion, was stoning bia hour;, on Monday Eiht. The N. V. TWtunc, commenting on the Presi dent's message, goes in heartily for the acquire ment of Eaa Domingo, thinks it will be merged in the LT. S. in 1S71, and that it is worth a dozen Aliskas. Wooden heels are cominr. into general use in the cast. The Slar Heel Manufactory at Lynn, JIass., turns out 9,000 paira weekly, adding to their macbiairy to meet the increasing demand. They are principally used on ladies', misses', and children's toots and shoes. The immense accumulation of business for the submarine telegv&ph, now that two of the cables' are not in working order, shows the wonderful increase of tbe messages between Europe and Americi during the last four years. One cable cvnuot begin to do the work now oUereJ. There is one advantage in the decreased facilities our war dispatches are condensed, and correspond ingly clearer. New cables will doubtless be lai 1 as socn as they can be manufactured. Spoetino. - A deer was driven by hunters into the lake, on the New York side, on Tues day, and ht swam a:ross, coming out near Adams' Ferrv. in Taaton, and tcok to the wood. Hunters, dogs and guns were in requi sition in Vergennes Thursday morning, for the purpose of bagging the venison. A decision was made by Speaker Ulainc in the House on Monday, which will prevent a great waste of time in speech-making, if it is only ad hered ti. It was to the eifect thjt he would not permit members entitled to the floor to yield their time to others, who desire to introduce matter in regalar order of business foreign to the sutject under consideration.

Kven the McptiWioan Diet at Frank fort, in 1M, oflercd the imperial crown to the late King of PruHsia. Hut he declined it. The only unity the German n vee has ever socn was under the Holy Hoimm Empire. Its thousand years of hietory arc full of glo rious records of German prowcsn and great ness. Dating from the coronation ot Charle magne by Pope Leo in MJO, it life ends at a period within the recollection of s Mnc of our readers, at the abdication of Francis II. of Austria, in August, 1?-0G. The grandest achievements of the German people belong to the history of the old Empire. It was while fighting under it banner that they made themselves the rulers of Europe. Then it was that Gaul and Norman, Italian and Saracen alike went down before their valor and strength. I'nder the Empire it was that Germany emerged from barbarist-i, and reached her high place as a leader in civili zation. Disastrous indeed in many ways was the old Imperial rule to German pct.ee and liberty ; but in the yearning for unity, tbe good rather than the evil of the old life of the Empire i remembered. It is hoped that the good may be again secured and the evil avoided. Hut wc do not eupposc that the old imtc-1 rial farms arc to bo reproduced. We do not believe that the South German States arc to surrender their individuality. VCc th all look with deep interest lor the details oft ra new plan. But unqutionauly in some f ana the German States arc to endeavor to act together in all matters of common interest under the guidance ol Prussia. A question of profound interest will aritc at once : what will be the cfiect upon the German population of Aus tria and of Kussia ? This new consolidation cannot but awaken a feeling ol German na tionality and patriotism in them. There may be in this an clement of great danger to the tranquility of Austria in particular.

Many who would fav.ir the adoption of free trade principles if wc were free from debt acknowledge the nc.'cjbity of drawing large sums from our customs. There is therefore no need cf your party, and because there is no need of it, there is no possibility of it." Such arc, in substance, the answers of the two great parties to the new party men. And cow the latter arc stoutly denying that they have ever intended to fret a new organization on foot. Tbey declare that their only aim has been to bring tbe republican party up to its true work, to imbue it with their prin ciples, 1 1 secure for it permanent usefulness. They have doubtless learned the useful les son that such is the only work they can ac complish. They cannot make a nations! party at will. And let as remember, too, that no handful of men can preserve the life of a party when it work is done. Our brief national history is strewn with tbe wrecks of parties, which may teach u this wholesome lesson. W'c are more than willing to Icar it in mind. And if the day come when tbe republican party does not represent ideas of national im portance and beneficence, let it pasi un- mourned to its grave. But just because it does to-day embody such vital ideas, because it is inspired by broad and generous princi ples, which the corruptions and abuses inci dent to ten years of prosperity and power have not neutralized, wo give it our hearty support and look for it continuance. Recent reports brought by shipmasters of the weatbsr at sea are in marked contrast to the mild and pleasant airs experienced on land dar ing the past few weeks. W.thin two hondnd miles of the coast vessels have encountered se- Tere storms of wind and rain, and some of them have suffered serious damage to sails and rig ging For the past few weeks the weather west ward of the Grand Bank hiu been very heavy, and tbe gale of the '-"-M ult. is represented to have been exceedingly boisterous, doing consid erable injory to shipping r.ear the coast. Bat nhile the storm rages at sea the inshore water have been as vet bardly agitated. The conflict of aotbority in Alabama appears to have been settled by compromise. Smith, the outgoing Governor, ha withdrawn his opposi tion, the democratic cacdijate ha been sworn and men of both parties rejoiee. It would teem that Gov. Smith was not prepared to substan tiate his charges of fraud anl intimiiatioa in the election, hence his withdrawal. It is most positively asserted, however, that there were good grounds for them, and justice to the re cently enfranchised freed men seem to demand thit an investigation should be made. The " counterfeit money" ssindle just now sejms to be very hard pushed by its rracti.-cm, at least ia thtse parts. Cluite a number ha-.- sent to us copies of the circular wherein under soa.c different names some saoundrel offers to furnish counterfeit money at a low rate. The J r i.-.i ;i .lriruftiru for this month give the names of several who hive been arresrei for carrying on this game. If any man is fuol anl knau enuagh to send thera any money, he get nothing at all, or at mc: a package containing a bit o! wood in return. A short time since a liquor dealer in Medway, Mis.. took from the exprcs" office a box from tLe swindling firm on which Le pail S','7, and afier discovering that there was nothing but kindling wood and paper in it brought it hack ti the express uthc. and tried unsu- crasfullj to get back his money.

When the Legisla ture meets next month, there will te a special act pasted, probably, to fill this vacancy. Gen. John Baton, U. S. Commissioner of Klu- catioc, in his annual report, makes a remark able exhibit of the relative expenditures of the States for icbool purposes to each child of school age. He finds that little Nevjda, having but few children in her t-opulation of 4.r,000, expends for their schooling at the rate of 10 a peace, while Massachusetts heads the litt of the states where children abound, with a per capita expen- ditureof glfi,15. California pays SI 1-44 and Connecticut $10.29, while no other state ex pends half so much at Massachusetts. New York gets alcng with ?C 88, Pennsylvania with S7 8G, Illinois with S7.83. Ohio with 6.43. Ilhode Island with 6 20, Vermont with SG.47, Maine S4.73, New Hampshire $1.G0, while Kentasky laiehes tventy-thrte centt, and North Carolina fortfcight cents on every child of the school age, or lees than a twentieth part of what Massachusetts pays. Gee. Katon praises the Illinois school reports as the most complete ; Massachusetts reports are valuable and full as to public tchools, but no records are given of the colleges. Many of the states have good systems under their new constitutions, bat the apathy or open opposition of large classes makes them in efficient There are many novel and startling things in the report, and, among them, certain statistics of the comparative illiteracy of males and females in the country, which are, the com missioner says, appalling, and show the neces sity for a more thorough education of women. to do it, and never entertained tbe sentiments expressed m it, and will sorely never do so any more. Ve don't know whether Porter was ever m- , gaged in cotton speculations or not; but the man who could write such a letter as bis last. Is not the man to be at the heal of the U. S. Navy. Porter has long been bitterly hated In the mvy: army officers won't think any more of bim than before, since the publication of his opinion that they generally laok magnanimity ; and every body must now despise him. We hope Gen. Logan's till to abolish the rank of Admiral will pass. The rank was made Ibr Farragut, and no such man as Porter should be allowed to dis grace it PesrEKT. With the cpeninc of the winter season , the N. Y. Tribune has evidently been vexed out of all pitienc'e by an exaperating flood of importunity for editorial puffs of public entertainers and their performances, in advance of their appearance. Perhaps it is an uncour teous thing to say, it observes, in an article ic reference to this, but public exhibitors and per formers of all sorts, and their agents and man agers, when they viit an editor's office generally come on impeninent errands." And it gives them a gentle hint that after their books, their pictures, their actio r, their music, have been fully judged and pronounced upon, they can be as civil to the journalist as they please ; but while waiting for the verdict, delicacy requires that they should ksep aloof.

RETALIATION TBOM CaSAUA. A despatch from Toronto, cf Saturday's date, tays that in view of the threatened adoption cl President Grant and Cutler's non-inter-commer cial policy towards Canada, including the with drawal ofthe bonding system, it is interesting to knew the immense accommodation Trhich Canada has afforded to the United States by permitting that country free use of the Welland canal. For the year ending June 30, 1S70, 2,faS4 American steam and sailmg vessels with a tonnage of 705,712 tons have passed through the canal. The w ithdrawing of the bonding privilege would, it ia currently believed, necest-anly entail a lite withdrawal of the u-e of the Welland canal to American vessels, which of course would affect most disastrously Chicago, Cleveland, Oswego and Ogden&burg. U. S. District Court. ixposraUT hv!Fit rrjiantv. Two important Jc sions were made by Judge Small ey Thursday, in bankruptcy cases One of thzse was in tbe ease f F.

It further nppcan-I that Gregory 4 Co. knew at the time thr pu: their tcsouat in process of col'.ecuun, that B inn later hid other debts, which h wa slow ;n paying. On the IS.h of February, Ws Baniiwter went into bankruptcy. Tbe assignee demanded the re-pay ment to him by G. s Co . cf tbe t?3't0, to be di u-!ed amng all tbe credit r with tbe rest of Bannister's property ; and this being refused in due time he brought suit Judge Smalloy decided .n this ease that ina 1 rency, in the eye of the bankruptcy law, moans not that n man cttnnc: piy his debts ; bat that heroes not pay them in the ordinary course of business ; that Gregory & Co., having reason to j know that Bannister was insolvent, in that sense, j when they e;Ilected their claim, such oollectiun ani payment to them became not a moral fraud, but a fraud in the meaning of the law ; and that the S3') most b refunded to the assignee. The other case was an appeal from the deci sion of the Commissioner of Bankruptcy ia the cases cf V. i C. B. Kelsey and others rt. Estate of I an:.el Casey, bank rapt The fits U Ibis case we under to be as follows : Cisey was a drover who took some cattle belonging to himself to market, and with tbem at the same time some cattle belonging to the Kelsey anl other parties, which be was to sell on commission. He did so, selling all the cattle eff, .is own and the others st the same lime, without making any separate account of he m ney received, putting Attempt was made to leave Gen. Fatterson off from the Committee on Foreign Kelatious ; this raised a muss. Some cried " Foal," and said it was for the sake of packing the oonunittee in favor cf tbe San Domingo treaty. Mr. Patter son iesired to remain upon the coinmittee, and Mr. Sumner strongly aivoeated his remaining. ConievjoenUy the Senate went again into caucus and Mr. Patterson was replaced upon the com mittee. But little general legislation has been reached yet. The Senate yesterday passed a resolution, offered by Mr. Iomeroy, donat ing the old cast-off carpets of the chamber and committee rooms, which were advertised tj be sold at auction to-day, to the various cr phan aiylums in this city. Tlwee carpets are old , worn and moth eaten, and to a great extent worthless ; cutting and vatefaing, however, will render them useful in contribating to the com fort of these unfortunate ones ; and will be as good a substitute for Wilton or Brai sels to their inexperienced feet, as is the methodical fare cf the asylum for the higher joys of home and the loving tenderness of parents. To tee tbem as they, under the guidance of the matrons, file out upon a Sabbath morning to chnrch, hundreds of tbem, is enough to touch tbe heart of a stone, nod X am sure that bo woiisisUnt taxpayer could grudge them these carfes. In tbe House of Revjmentatives there was but little of the usual flurry and excitement incident tu commencement of a session. One of the first measures proposed is upon tho hud-grab sj tiem, proposed for the benefit of a western railroad. The fact that UndeSam" has already donated to railroads hands greater in extent than alt New r.ngtami, laew lorn, and reusy'vanta, ooe noc suffice ; and the question of land subsidies will have to be fought in Congress while there is a public domain to plunder from. Carry in the seasion a bill was mtrodnced by Mr. Poland of Vermont amendatory to an established law for the prevention of Mnnggiing The general work of the House has beta upon a bill reported i y Mr Farnsworth. oodifrius; and sjneadine the postal laws. The bill is ttiU -before the House, being slowly matured in comnuttee of the whoie. One of tbe last actions ppon it was the striking out of the entire chapter relating to the franking privilege, tnus, so tar as the action ol tne ttcu-e goes, abolishing it without providing substitute: bat there is little danger cf its passing the Senate in it present, form, or in any other very contracted shape. It is so easy n matter to frank letters and documents, and there Is so much to send that tbe simple process of frank ing often becomes labor. The doing away of the privilege entirely is :is inexpedient as t is improbable. Our tax pavers would not like to forego the delicious speeches, the voluminous agricultarij, the ornamental pa tent office reports, and tbe thousand and one other public documents, to say nothing of tbe great variety of seeds, nil sent under frank.

On the whole the General considers his ar rest a fortunate circumstance, as it prevented his crossing the line and touch consequent bicol sheJ. He seems to have felt considerably the criticisms on his handling of his men during the skirmish, and makes the Tery good point that ' as to lack of generalship, if there had been men to command, there would hare been ecme opportunity for judging whether it was lacking or not; as it wts, there was not more than a Captain's command present." Ife con siders worthy of mention for gallantry, in tbe affair,! Geo- Donnelly, Col. Drown, Charles Carleton, Major Murphy, Captains Cronio, Murphy, Fitzpatrick, and Ahern, and Lieut. Hallaghan. Gen. O'Neill devotes considerable space tu repelling divers attacks upon bis char acter, and especially the charge of the misuse of the Fenian funis. To the question " what has become of the moneys paid into the Feniau treasury" he answers: How were ail the arms, war material and clothing at Franklin and Malone, procured and transported to tbe border ? The alteration of breechloaders alone cost, according to Mr. Meeban,over sixty thous and dollars, anl ths organization Is iu posses sion of ammunition and war material besides that collected at Malone and Franklin.' In an appendix. Major Murphy's report, and ex tracts from Gen. Donnelly's report are given, the first of which is quite sharp on tbe author of the second. The latter puts on record his opinion that " nothing but the tardiness of the men in coming forward at the time agreed upon, prevented the occupation of the whole country south of the St. Lawrence within three davs," which is an opinion as is an opinion." Perhaps the most sensible paragraf h cf Gex O'Neill's pamphlet is that in which he furswears all connection with any future attempt to invade Canada, snd In this his subordinate officers appear fully to agree with him. He says : " Shall another attempt be male to invade Canada?" i3 a question which I have been asked frequently s'nee my imprisonment; to which I answer. No! emphatically no. And now I give timely notice to any man or set of men who may have any idea of attempting it ajtain, while England and Canada are at peace with the world, that nothing that it is possible for me to do shall be left undone to frustrate it. Believing that the only opportunity for success in that direction has passed, and passed forever, 1 shall for the future be found as zealous in my opposition to such an enterprise as I have been hitherto earnest, laborious and persevering in iti advocacy. In all candor and sincerity I ad- way of doing this opinions ar many various. The Boston Adrer.ittr says (he late Judje Collamer, of Vermont, was in the habit of givms; a humorous description of a dry in the United States Senate. First, ha would say, Wilson in troduces a bill, then Feesenden gets angry, then Samner makes a classical speech, and so on, happily touching upon some characteristics of the most prominent members. This year, how ever, on the opening of the session, it was Mr. Samner who introduced the bill, which was one intended to effect the resomption of specie pay ment,. Mr. Lynch of Maine, has introduced in the House a bill for a similar Htrpose, which he proposes to eneet oy a more summary process p ortant financial measures at thia session. The chief interest of last week's coogmaion.-il 1 well known, the woe, a ou in v p-oceedings, after the reading of the President's message, appears to have grown out of the abor tive attempt to reconstruct the senate committer of foreign affairs. It owed its detest to Mr. Sam ner, who suspected it to be nude in the interest of tne San Domingo scheme, (t is believed in some quarters that Mr. Susaner is engaged on an elaborate research Sir fact support hie op position to the proposed annexation, and will embody them in a great speech when the busi ness comes up for ilebate. The House showed its temper on this question by killing Mr. Banks' joint resolution, introduced Monday, authoriz ing tbe President to appoint a com mil-'ion of five persons to inquire into the expediency of nego tiiiing a treaty for the acqni'ition of the Island. money all together without distinction into hie walls', and paying out of it without distinction his various expenses. A day or two after, while at ahctel or boarding house iu B-ston, the money was stolen from him (all but fifteen or twenty dollars left by the thief in li s wallet), without negligence on his part. Casey returned to Addison county ani told his story. He eouli not tell whether the email balance remaining ww part of the mrney paid to h m on his own cattle or on the account of tbe other parties. Put be acknowledged hi liabilify for the turns he , , j than Mr. Sumner abut tbe temper of both houses and the sum (some sJ.

The i ther debtors appealed from this to the L" S. District Couit.and the court, after a brief bearing uf the counsel for the appellants, no opposing counsel appearing, re versed the decision of the Commissioner, and threw out the cl vitas of Messrs. Kelsey and the others like theirs, which thus became a total lost. These decisions of the court are final, there being no appeal from them. Iter. Ebenezer Burgee", D.D., of Dedham.
