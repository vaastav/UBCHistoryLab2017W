It costs three years In the peniten tiary to talk back to Judge Orvis.of Cen tre county. At least that Is what a boy had added to his sentence for speaking disrespectfully td that august Judge In court. We would prefer the feelings of the boy to a Judge who could so lose his temper. An attempt was made to kill the Emperor of Russia last week. The train he was expected to be on was blown up, but he had passed half an hour earlier and the damaged train carried the baggage. The explosion caused a gap In the permanent roadway four feet and eight inches deep, sixteen feet long and eighteen feet broad. The New York "Herald" Is authority for the statement that the question as to who is to be the next Lieutenant Gov ernor of New York is not yet legally set tled. The Democrats claim that ballots cast for " C. M. Potter" should have been counted for the candidate, Clarkson N. Potter, instead of being thrown aside as " defective" or " scattering"," which was done by the county canvas sers. The question will not be definite ly settled until the State Board of Can vassers meet, which will not be before the 15th.. Mr. Haskins' majority is va riously stated at from 10 to 240. The President's Message. The Annual Message of the President was delivered to Congress on the 1st Inst. It is quite lengthy, but the following gives a brief abstract of the Important features of the document. The President makes resumption the starting point, and congratulates the Nation on the success of the return to specie basis. He thinks that " with a currency equivalent in value to the mon ey of the commercial world, we are en abled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and produc tion. The Increasing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural pro ducts has caused a large" balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid In gold from the 1st of July last to November 15, to the amountof about $39,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the Government, bearing only 4 per cent, interest, have been sold at or above par sufficient in amount to payoff all of the National debt which was re deemable under present laws. The amount of Interest savd annually by the process of refunding the debt since March 1, 1877,1s $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the publio securities is much greater than ever before. "The amount of the National debt which matures in less than two years is $793,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bears interest at the rate of S per cent., and the balance Is in bonds bearing C per cent, interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of 5 per cent, bonds, and by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected about $11,000,000 can be annually saved to the Treasury. To se cure this important reduction of inter est to be paid by the United States fur ther legislation is required, which It is hoped, will be provided by Congress during Its present cession. The coinage of gold by the minis of the United States during the last fiscal year was $40,9W,12. The coinage of sliver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was $48,000,850, of which $12,700,844 has been Issued from the Treasury and Is now In circulation, and $32,800,000 is still in the possession of the government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver In the recog nized money of the world leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, Internal and foreign, will supply, during the coming year, Its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting fur ther experimental measures with the coinage. I would, however strongly urge upon Congress the importance of authorizing the Secretary of the Treas ury to suspend the coinage of sliver dol lars upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the Bilver bring uni formly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, It Is obviously impracticable to maintain .them at par with each other If both are coined with out limit. "The retirement from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal tender In private contracts, is a step to be taken In our progress toward a safe and stable currency, which Bhould be accepted as the policy and duty of the government, and the Interest and securi ty of the people. It is my firm convic tion that the issue of legal tender paper money, based wholly upon the authori ty and credit of the government, except in extreme emergency, is without war rant in the constitution, and a violation of strong financial principles. The Issue of United States notes during the late civil war, with the capacity of legul ten der between Individuals, was not author ized except as a means of rescuing the country from Imminent peril. The cir culation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were Issued. They anticipated the redemption and with drawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period consistent with the at tainment of the object for which they were provided. " The President reports our relations with all foreign nations in a satisfactory condition. He gives considerable atten tion to the civil service reform and on the subject says: "The views I have heretofore ex pressed concerning the defects and abuses In our civil administration re main unchanged except In so far, as an enlarged experience has opened my sense of the duty, both of officers and the people themselves, to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils and perils and of a partisan-spoils system of appointment to ofilce and of office ten ure are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in the reports of departments, in the de bates and proceedingsof Congress, in the messages of Executives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform has been admitted. To command the necessary support, every means of reform must bo based on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free State. When the peo ple have approved a policy at a national election, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected and of the advisers who, iu accordance with our political institutions, should be consult ed in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, is indispensable. It is eminently proper that they should ex plain it before the people as well as Illus trate Its spirit in the performance of their official duties." After saying much more on this sub ject, he closes this part of his message as follows : " Though an officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money in aid of his opinions or his par ty ,he Bhould also be as free any other cit izen to refuse to make such gifts. If sal aries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officers, it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive In order that they may bear the tax the excess Is an indirect robbery of the publio funds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life - or public employment the protection with which a great and en lightened nation should guard those who are faithful in its service." The subject of polygamy is referred to and Congress Is asked to take further means to suppress the evil. The failure of Congress to pass the appropriation bills applicable to Con gressional elections and Marshalls' ex penses is noticed, and an earnest request is made that the matter be cared for at this session. In reference to the Indian affairs, the President suggests that the law tie al lowed to remain as It In, and objects to having the control of the Indian affairs taken from the Interior Depart ment and placed on the army. The President closes hi message by a refer ence to the Washington Monument and a hope that an appropriation would be made to finish that monument and to Improve the school buildings of the Dis trict of Columbia. Strange Case In Massachusetts. The wife of Franklin Chase died sud denly at Westport on November 20th, Pieparatlons for her burial were made, but the lifelike remains induced' the friends to postpone the funeral and the body has been kept until the present time, no changes having appeared since death. It Is not yet known whether the case Is one of suspended animiatyn or whether death lius' actually taken place. For Tub Times.
