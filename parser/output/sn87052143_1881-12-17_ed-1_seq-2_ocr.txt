Thai Mississippi greenbaokers are try ing to get Mr. Arthur to help them ob tain possession of the state government, by lorce, if necessary. It won't work; Arthur knows better than to revive Grant's, bayonet policy.

Pennsylvania will be one of tbe next radical states to be liberalized. At tbe recent election the republican candi date fur treasurer tell 62,521 votes short of a majority. There is hope that the blind bigotry of republicanism is com ing to be appreciated even therl. The democratic party wiil be Idiotic whenever it follows Messrs. Hendricks ' and Voorhees into even a quasi indorse ment of the fallacious principle, and practical robbery, ol a protective tariff policy. Let some of the leaders who have courage as well as brains call a halt in this senseless stampede. The Chicago Times says: "Friends 61 Bill Ryan, tbe convicted train-robber of Missouri, have repeatedly threatened the life of Governor Crittenden, and are said to have conspired to abduct his daughter and hold her as a hostage for the pardon of the desperado." What a whopper! Try something else. Guiteau . must make Messrs. Arthur . and Conkling very uncomlortabie, when ' he alludes to them as indebted to bim ior "removing tbe president. He asems especially to delight in ringing tbe changes on the assertion that be made Mr. Arthur president. Arthur don't like this, of course, but who can ga:nsay it P. ME. AETfflJE AND THE 

NATIONAL BANKS. An intelligent democratic friond who reads and thinks for himself, asked us a tew days aero, "Were yon not mutaken when you said in your last paper that the president in bis message bad shown himself to be servile to tbe national banks ?" He then instanced in support of his view that portion of the document in which the president 'indirectly rec ommended that ''the national banks may properly be forbidden by law to retire their currency, (except upon reasonable notice of their intention so to do." - We certainly had no Intention of mis construing Mr. Arthur. In condensing his too long message we gave our read era its most interesting and valuable points, and cheerlnlly bore testimony to its having been well written. Lengthy as was tbe document it bristled with statements of fact and practical sugges tions, and was as different in that re spect from tbe vacuous platitudes of Mr. Hayes as it well could be. Further, it was a business paper, and in its avoidance of purely political questions, even though such avoidance was for prudential party reasons, it possessed a merit rare in the messages of republi can presidents. But, :o the question. It will be re membered that the democrats in the last congress passed a 3 per cent, f unding bill. ; The banks protested against it, and, in order to intimidate Mr. Hayes, withdrew a large amount of their circu lation so much at one time as to threat en a panic. They had said that the S per cent, bill should not become a law, and tbey were ready to wreck tbe busi ness of the country rather than that their threat should not be enforced. With the same old pride of power which Nicholas Biddle inlnsed into the Bank ol tbe United States in Jackson's time they practically asserted that they were stronger than the government. Unfor tunately tor the country Mr. Hayes did nut have the moral courage which characterized . Old Hickory, and the tanks made their assertion good. They were stronger than the "strong govern ment" of which the republican party so lavishly boasts. Mr. John Sherman was secretary of tbe treasury, then Mr. Sherman, the Iriend of the banks; the friend, of the syndicates. He was sue ceded by Mr. Windom, a man much more en rapport with the people, and the treasury report though ostensibly made by Judge Folger was prepared under Mr. Windom'a supervision. The scandal raised by the shameless "bull dozing" of the national banks was so un popular that it could not go unnoticed, and the secretary ol the treasury briefly ahuded to it. Mr. Arthur does not say ol h s own volitiou that tbe banks should not be permitted to surrender their cir culation, etc.; he does say: "The secretary advises that the issue of gold certificates should not, for the present, be resumed, and tugget that the national banks may properly be' for' bidden by law to retire their curren cy, except upon reasonable notice of their intention to to do. Such legit' lation would teem to be justified by the recent action of certain banks oh the occation referred to in the secretary't report." "Would seem to be justified." Well, yes; rather. He conld hardly pass by unnoticed so seri ous a subject. II could not uotioe it and say less, without involving himself in the scandal which even national bank newspapers were forced to condemn. This mild-manered criticism will never be heeded by a republican con gress ; but what we object to more seri ously than this faint condemnation, which practically .excuses, are senten ces like these : "I approve the recom mendation of the secretary of the treas ury, that provision be made for tbe early retirement of silver certificates, and that the act requiring their issues be repealed.' They were issued In pnrsu- ance of the policy of the government to maintain silver at or near the gold standard, and were accordingly made receivable for all customs, taxes and public dues. About $66,000,000 of them are now outstanding. They form' an unnecessary addition to tbe paper currenoy, a sufficient amount of which may be readily supplied by the national bankt.'" What more can the banks ask than tbe statement that 'a sufficient amount of currency may be readily supplied by the national banks P' . Mr. Arthur then proceeds to elaborate his idea of reducing taxes by advocating a repeal of the law by which "banks and bankers are assessed upon their capital and deposits." When we consider the demand he makes to cease the coinage of silver; to repeal tbe laws authorizing the issuance of gold as well aa silver certificates; the cool assertion that the national banks can supply all needed ourrency ; and then the argument which he injects into his message to relieve the banks from taxes, we are fain to think, that with all their stupendous impudence the banks could not have bad the effrontery to ask bim more boldly to advocate the meas ures which they desire accomplished. Elsewhere we criticise the president's message adversely ; we desire, also, to say a word iu its lavor. Mr. Arthur is tbe first republican president to dely a certain element in his party by omitting Irom his message to congress vile flings at the people of tbe son h lie has indulged in no clap-trap about re bellion, and the danger ol trusting the intelligence ol an entire section of the country. There is more in this refusal to impugn the patriotism oi tbe south ern people that will break down tbe old and effete hatreds oi the past than in a dozen Pharisaical, canting speeches of a man like Hayes. For thus departing Irom the conventional course ol bis party associates, Mr. Arthur deserves the applause of all good citizens. It may be tbat he has learned that tbe bloody shirt has served its day, except with the most ignorant and bigoted, but tbe message in other respects is much freer from tbat charlatanry ol politics, that cheap demagogism which has so long been tbe stock in trade of republican statesmen, so callel. How ever it comes let us thank the goda for the good they send ua. What would be said by the republicans of tbe depravity in a democratic state were men to rob the houses ol opposing editors to get their papers to use against them P That is just what is charged re garding tbe recent burglary of Col. D. R. Anthony's residence at Leavenworth, though $300 in more vulgar plunder was carried off. Tbe Globe-Democrat salutes Mr. Blaine as be steps out of the state de partment, not with a kiudly word, but with a vigorous kiok. It begins by saying: "It will be generally admitted that a 'Rupert of debate' is not exactly the kind of a man to make the best secretary of state for a nation wbicb takes a particular pride in being at peace with tbe rest of tho world. Jef ferson gave voice in his inaugural ad dress to what has since become a stand ard American sentiment. It is : 'Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none.' The , Monroe doctrine was not construed so as to auy way interfere with this programme until Mr. Blaine became a cabinet minister. Mr. Blaine is entirely too vigorous and sparkling for a safe administrator el foreign affairs." After elaborating this idea it adds : "Nobody will deny Mr. Blaine's great abilities. He is a very smart man. Perhaps it he were not quite so smart he would be an undeniably great man. Tbe political blaze be has kept up for a number of years has been most too bright, and there is some reason to believe that it will be a long tima before be is heard from in a prominent public position again. It seems almost a pity tbat this should be the case, but such is the prospeot." Alas ! Prince Rupert, that thou should'st fall so low as to excite the pity of thine enemy ! 'Almost pity that he has burned out, and that it will be a long time before he is heard from in a prominent publio position again?' But Is this true P The Cin cinnati Commercial just before the nomination of Garfield at Chicago aver red that the most nonsensical chatter of the occasion was the talk about Garfield, as be did not have a record to run on ; still he was nominated, aud the Com mercial became reconciled to his 'rec ord.' The Globe-Democrat during the canvass lor nomination viimea ana made light of the opponents of Grant, but Grant was defeated, and it lorgot Its sarcasms and innuendoes until alter the election, when it was as glib in its Credit-Mobilier, DeGolyer pavement, and Mulligan letters allusions as any democratic paper in the land a little more so. ' By the aid of Mr. Gniteau's pistol it has a stalwart in the White House, and it is its day to crow, bnt In 1884 tbe "Man From Maine," the Rupert oi Debate" will be there, and the Globe Demoorat, should he be nom inated, despite tbe merciless use of the machine against him, will tois up its hat for the man whom it now thinks anything but great. Mr. George William Curtis in last week's Harper's Weekly, says in an ed itorial artiole on ''the star route robber ies," tbat "It there Is not the clearest evidence that the success of the prose cutions is desired, and they should tail, the effect upon the administration and the republican party would be like tbat of the event of the whisky ring prose cutions in 1875 6. Tbe extraordinary performances ol that prosecution and the result went far to persuade the country that it was about time to change the party control of the govern ment, and if the influences tbat were gratified by the' failure of some of those prosecutions had not been : deleated at Cincinnati ' in tbe nomination of presi dent, the republican party would have been overthrown." Mr. Curtis' ' fine moralizing constrains us to exclaim with the noble Dane, "Words, words. words!" When did he ever resort to more than words to correct the evils of his party's course ? Never. He preaches against the machine, and votes for the candidates it chooses ; he depre cates corruption in the republican party, but at the ballot box indorses it. There Is but one way to check tbe stalwarts of the whisky ring and star route robberies, who practically control the republican party, and tbat is to overthrow the party, but no help need be looked for at Mr. Curtis' hands. It is as certain as that Grant was president, and Arthur is president, that tbe "star route rob bers," as Mr. Curtis calls them, will go unpunished; and yet what more will we have from Mr. Curtis than "words, words, words?" Still it Is some grat ification to have so eminent a republi can bear witness to the faot tbat his party is guilty of indorsing a mass of peculation which is only second to such stupendous steals as the whisky ring and the Credit Mobilier. A gentleman said to us a lew days ago tbat Blaine was very strong with the Germans, and that ibis fact would go a long way toward securing him tbe republican nomination in 1881. "Why, look at his course toward the German visitors at the Yorktown celebration," said he, "and Baron Von Steuben has named hit baby boy, 'Blaine Steuben! ' " Yes, tbat is all true, but stiil the Germans will not be considered in making the republican nomination for president They are expected to vote tor whoever is named as a matter of course Blaine if ft is Blaine; but Grant If it is Grant. No American statesman ever did s much for Germans as did Mr. Washburue. His record as a congressman and as a diplomat exhibits constant effort in behalf of the people.and is in every way above reproach. It is so good as to be unlike tbat of most eminent republicans there bein; no smirches on it from the Credit Mobilier, whisky ring. Mul ligan lettera.star-route robberies or ant? thing of that kind; nevertheless his name was scascely considered at Chica go. What good did his eminent services to the Germans do him ? None ! Neither will Mr. B aiue's little coquetries in that direction.

The state supreme court -has rendered a decision in the Hannibal & St. Joseph railroad bond case, which makes the road liable for the interest on its bonds until such time as they are redeemable. As the state has the principal already in its possession, the railroad's little game to make the interest will not work. The governor and the lund commission ers have done well in tbe matter. 1 T. I. k.ln nSnff tr ho A mftMftr ftf t"Om. it SO VOglUUUJ U WW H mon observation that the return to power in congress of the republicans is tbe signal for tbe return ol tbe lobby which tbe democrats banished froni Washing ton. So able and conseivative a journal as the American Register says : "The evidence accumulates that the return of the republican party to power in the house of representatives is to be signal ized by the presence of a colossal lobby, armed with boundlt as impudence, and backed by enormous financial strength During tbe domination of the democratic party at the capitol, tbe lobby lost its Identity, and ceased to exist as a fac tor in national legislation, but with tbe return of republicanism to power, tbo insolent Lazzaroni of the lobby will come swarming back, only more ra pacious tban ever by reason of their long enforced absence Irom the corri dors and caverns of the great building on Capitol Hill. The presence of these hateful vampires is abundantly evident on the streets and iu our great caravan sarles, and long before the holiday re cess occurs the lobbies and anie cham bers of the capitol will be thronged with the Captain Rooks of one sex, and the painted, flaunting Jezebels of the other." The New York Herald in an article on the subject prediots rioh and powerful lobbies in the following inter ests: The dismemberment of Mexico In order to grasp several of her northern states; the Peruvian guano job; the iuter-ooeaoio canals, and the San Do mingo job. To these may be added the high tariff lobby,' which can afford to spend its . millions. Altogether the prospeot seems to be that wine, women and wassail will once more reign at the capital, where wisdom, ' prudence and temperance should prevail. We . hope tbat the .democrats, will distinguish themselves by their soberness and watch fulness, and that their votes lor rigid economy in expenditures will make the vultures both male and female their enemies. 1 ' In commenting upon . the rapacity and extortion of consolidated railroad corporations, the St. Louis Journal of Agriculture says : "Missouri expresses this sontiment . in the legend on her state seal and coat ol arms Salut Pop uli Suprema Lex Est. The Liberty of the People is the . Supreme Law. Whenever, therefore, oorporate power endangers the liberty of an intelligent people, so much the worse will It be for Incorporated capital' ' We indorse what our contemporary desires to say, but it mistranslates, and in doing so weakens its illustration. Salut cannot by any possibility be rendered 'liberty,' it means 'salety.' Webster in his trans lation of tbe entire motto gives it "the welfare," &o, but ' this is a free rendi tion. Salut is a comprehensive word. and is used to denote help, life, remedy, a salutation wishing all of these, bnt especially safety. So tbat the motto ol the state really more thoroughly em phasizes the lesson our. contemporary would inculcate than' it indicates. Many people deride tbe idea that cor porate power can ever attack our liber ties, but our welfare, our business salety is attacked beyond dispute when tbe corporation' preys npon tbe community instead of serving it for a resonable com pensation.. We . believe that these gigantic monopolies, and the' corrupt use ol money by which they , attain their ends, do threaten the liberties' of the people. Rome foil .because - of I'her wealth, luxury and consequent' inordi nate ambitien; why may not we P, Un less we gird on our armor, and fight even tashionable corrnption we shall. . . Henry Ward Beecher in bis Tbanks giving sermon made these -sensible ob servations: "Tbe two systems ol rais ing money are by internal revenue" and by the tariff, and tbey are trying to di minish the former and fortify the latter, which is the Chinese Wall, and it is the last bar to liberty. They are trying to take the tax off matches and enlarge the liberty of tobacco aud rum. while com merce is hin.lered. It la proposed to endow ships while tbey can bring noth ing to our tariff-closed ports. Liberty in commerce,to buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest markets will oome next. There is no doubt as to the outcome. There is only one college in the country where free trade doctrines are not taught." And yet there are politicians who are blown from their moorings by tbe loud crying of the subsidy beggars, and who flee when not half so many pursue as they imagine. Jefferson City correspondence Ktnsas City Times: "The governor is prepar ed to pay $5,000 as the reward offered July 28, 1881, for the capture ot William Ryan, the Gletidale train robber, who was taken in Tennessee, returned to Jackson county, aad there tried; oonvic- ted and sentenced to the penitentiary tor twenty-five years. James McGinn is, W. L. Eartbman and Wm. J. Overton are the claimants of the reward. They are reprosented,by Hon. John B. Wright of Tennessee. The money is to be tor- warded to tbe First National bank of Nashville, to be paid to tbe claimants aa soon as they can decide among them-" elves tho proportion that shall be paid to eacb." One of the most important decisions ever rendered by the supreme court ol our slate regarding tbo rights of ship pers, is the one which we print on the outai.ie of thia issue, in tbe case of James W, Harrison, resp .vs. Mo. P. R.R. Cc, appellant. Alexander Graves, Esq., was Judge Harrison's attorney, and he fought the ground step by step, with great ability and persistence. Solomon Davis, a colored lad ot 14, residing at Warrenton, N.
