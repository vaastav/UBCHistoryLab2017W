Tha nawa la received tn The State Jour nal building over wlraa for this sole pur Why expect Hnerta to go a long u tbe champagne bolda out? If the nation won't take a naval holiday, why not make It a half-holl-oayT. . This country wouldn't object Just now to some of the products of the pauper labor of the old-world' hen. As the worms turns. A .sartorial authority is trying to popularise a Test for men that hooks up the back. Huerta says he la ready to give his life for his country. Giving lives to big country seems to be bis long suit. High cost of living note: A $500 Persian cat ran away in Washington wearing a $1,000 .turquoise and gold collar. ' t The Navajo uprising was under the leadership of Chief Be She She. Are the suffragists getting buey in a new quarter 7 Colonel Roosevelt should not permit himself to become discontented after his return from South America. There is still Asia. Some magazine eventually is going to make a hit by putting the picture of a nice, wholesome, bomely girl on its first cover. There is something to be said h favor of permitting Murphy to remain on the Job. A new boss of Tammany might be able to do something. A Chicago doctor says he is able to cure any case of blindness. But why bother when the slit skirt will accom plish the same result? A military commander Is to be suc ceeded by a civil governor on another of the Philippine islands. It is to be hoped that the Moros will also be civil. Kansas Is soaked. . It Is wetter than It has been for thirty years. But tbls Is literally, not llquorally speaking. In the latter respect it Is drier than the proverbial bone. : According to the estimate of the army engineers it will take a small matter of some $40,000,000 to fill the rivers and harbors improvement pork barrel dur ing the forthcoming year. If all Mexicans were as troublesome as the one who is staging that unusual performance in the Utah -Apex mine. it wouldn't be so much of a Joke for Uncle Sam to pacify Mexico. Only six national banks failed during thv year ending October 31. This is a pretty good showing, but there would be more reason to look upon it with sat isfaction were the deposits in national banks guaranteed. As the New Tork World says: If senators would devote to the discus sion of currency reform the time wast ed in personal and political remarks. they would do more to preserve their own dignity and to deserve the grati tude of the public. A General Villa or two in this country would become mighty popular with the much-battered consumers. He has noti fied the dealers In foodstuffs in the rebel territory In Mexico that if they Increase their prices, their stock of goods will be confiscated. ' The house of representatives has gone on record as favoring a naval holiday for at least a year. But it would be simple-mindedness on the part of the United States to take such a vacation with the other world-powers striving to break all existing records In tbe matter of battleship construction. i Difference In point of view Is again ilustrated, says the Christian Science Monitor, In the case of Vice President Marshall, who want 1 to. see "the cowardice taken out of the American dollar." There are many who be lieve that the American dollar at times has entirely too much courage. There appear to be a few of tha old fashioned Jeffersonian Democrats left in Kansas. - They are talking of follow ing the rather ' elaborate Democratic banquet of January 6. when Mr. Bryan wltt be the guest of honor and at which grape Juice win flow like water, with a dollar dinner on February zt. Or maybe they are merely, the ' Kansas Democrats who have not as yet con nected with a piece of state or federal Pie. : V::-rJ I MR. 

WILSON'S INCONSISTENCY. ' That was a neat little sidestep which President Wilson executed when he ex plained to the delegation of the Na tional American Woman's Suffrage as sociation why he deemed it impossi ble and impolitic to urge their cause in a message to congress. But it is likely to rebound on his head with the force of a hundred of brick. He styled himself In the presidential office as merely the spokesman of his party. He insisted that be was not at liberty to urge on congress in messages, policies which have not had the organic consideration of those for whom he is spokesman. It was not his province to "start anything," he said, and he add ed: "I have to confine myself to those things which have been embodied as promises to the people at an election. This is the strict rule I set .for my self." " "" It was only the other day. though, that President Wilson in his annual message to congress, which he deliv ered In person, tossed out the sugges tion that he favored legislation which would do away the national party conventions of the present variety. Instead of the delegate system that has been in vogue during the life, of the political parties as they are now constituted, he would have tbe national conventions of the future made up of the nominees for house of representa tives, nominees for the vacancies In the United States senate, the United States senators holding office, the members of the national committees, and the nomi nees for the presidency and the vice presidency. This is an exceedingly revolutionary political suggestion, as far as national politics is concerned. Nor has it ever ---n considered or ganically, so far as it is publicly known, by the Democratic party. Cer tainly it was not among the promises of this party on whlcb the last cam paign was waged. It may not be an original Idea with Mr. Wilson himself, but It hss been accepted as such the country over, and will be attributed to htm unless he makes a specific denial or explanation to the contrary. This much is positive, however. He cannot hang the idea on tha Democratic party, unless there has been a secret meeting of the party at which this and perhaps other reforms have been pro jected. That is not likely. Of course, most rules become noted because of tbe exceptions taken to them. But it doesn't savor much of a consistency that Is desirable in a man who holds the high office of president of the United States to announce in one breath a rule which he did not follow in an immediately preceding breath. He thus open himself to the charge that he only invokes the rule when It Is convenient.
