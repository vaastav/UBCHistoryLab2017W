Pliny and xElian relate that Mynuecides wrought out of ivory a chariot with four wheels and lour horses, and a ship with all her tack- j lings, both in eo small a compass that a bee could i hide either with its wings. . Nor should we doubt this when we find it recorded, on less questionable, .authority, that in the twentieth Year of Queen Elizabeth's reign a blacksmith of London, named Mark Scaliot, made a lock of iron, steel and brass, of eleven pieces, and a pipe key, all of which only weighed' one grain. Scaliot also made a chain of gold, forty-three links, which he fastened to the lock and key, and put it around the neck of a flea, which drew the whole with perfect oase. The chain, key, lock and flea, altogether, weighed but one grain and a half! Undrianus Junius saw at .Mechlin in Brabant a cherry stone cut into the form of a basket; in it were - fourteen pairs of dice distinct, the spots and numbers ol which were easily to be discerned with a good ye. Uut still more extraordinary than this bask et of dice, or anything we have yet mentioned, must have been a set of turnery shown at Home, in the time of I'ope Paul the Fifth, by one Shad, a turner, of Witelbrach, who had pur chased it from the artist, Oswaldus Northinge rus. It consisted of sixteen hundred dishes, which were all perfect and complete io every ! part, yet so f mall and slender that the whole could be easily inclosed in a case fabricated out of a peppercorn of the ordinary size. The Pope is said to have himself counted them, but with the help of a pair of spectacles, for the jr were so very small as to be almost invisible to the naked eye. Although his Holiness thus satis fied his eyes of the fact,- he did not, we are as sured, require of those about him to subscribe to it on the credit of his own infallibility; for he gave every one an opportunity of examining and juding for himself, and among the persons thus highly favored particular reference is made to Gasper Schioppiiis aud Johannes Faber, a physician of Home. Jumanus, of whose skill so many wonderful things are related, is said to have fabricated iron mills, which moved of themselves, so mi nute iu size that a monk could carry' one in his sleeve, and yet powerful enough to grind in a single day grain enough for the consumption of eight men.

He will ad here to the recommendations of his former re port; an enlargement of his powers for with drawing legal tenders, fiom circulation and 'fox funding the maturing debt, and possibly for ex changing six per cent for the five per cent bonds, which he can do when the- five per. cent eom in and par, as he thinks they certainly will, as soon as the excluded States are restored; He will recommend a revision and reduction of the tariff of custom duties, and of internal, taxes.

Congress will turn a deaf car to all Execu tive recommendations. ; The Radical leaders will labor iu the interest of speculators and plunderers. Already, powerful combinations have been formed to force through the Senate the abominable tariff which passed the House at the late session. Instead of giving, us a rev enue tariff, they will load it with duties for pro tection, and in some instances, prohibition, for the benefit of monopolies. .Prices under this system will rise, though gold may decline. The Radicals have invented a new mode for encouraging usurpation, on the part of Congress. They are to have -a great mass meeting to wel come, and greet the Radical members of Con gress upon their meeting; and, of course, to' de nounce and proscribe their political opponents especially the Johnson administration, and the recusant Southern States." - " - Of course no out-siders know what position tho President will take in bis Message.J Horrors of the Famine in India. The Revl J. Buckley, an English Baptist missionary, sta tioned at Cuttack, Orissa, writes: , Orphans have been brought dj'ing to our door, and many that we have received , have been too deeply famine stricken for nursing. and medicine to restore. After a few short days death has closed the scene. Tender and delicate women, lying on our verandah, have implored rice or money to purchase it, with cries that have pierced our hearts. Two cases of eating human flesh have been reported; in the one case it was proved that the person was insane; in the.other, a child was found eating its dead father's flesh which had been roasted, and in a few days after the child died. Mothers have left their children in the maidan (dunghill) to die, or have sold them for a few pice. In one case an only son was sold for a pint of milk; the mother eagerly drank it up, gave up her child, walked a few steps, and then dropped down dead. The dying and the dead have been seen lying in our streets, though this has not been so much at Cuttack as at Balasore and some oth er places. At Pooree, it has been common for the police to find, morning after morning, in the streets and lanes, sixty, seventy, eighty, and more corpses. In the Cuttack district, 3,000 deaths fiom famine and pestilence were reported in one week, and it is generally believed that at Balasore aud Poorce the distress has been severer; than here.

' V : By Mr : Leach, a resolution, instructing the Committee on the Judiciary, to consider the propriety and necessity of submitting a bill for the protection of honest debtors. Mr Leach, in explanation of the resolution be had intro duced, said that his object was, during the pre-, sent depressed condition of the country, and the fioancial embarrassment of the people generally, to co operate with the Judiciary committee of which he was a member, in framing a constitu tional bill, by which a board of valuation, or sworn disinterested freeholders, shall ' value the property of a debtor to be sold under execution, in such manner, that unless the creditor or his agent shall commence the bid at, say, three fourths of said cash valuation there shall be no sale. He said he should undertake to show, at the proper time, that such' a law was absolutely demanded by' every consideration of justice, the necessities of the time, and that in his opinion it would greatly enure, not only to the advantage of the debtor, but also to that of the creditor, Mr Wibon introduced a resolution, instruct ing the Committee on Propositions and Griev ances to consider the propriety of remunerating Justices of the Peace for service rendered, and to teport by bill or otherwise.

His Excellency the Governor recommends that the public lands donated by Congress for tbe Agricultural . and . Mechanical improvement of the JState, should be given to the ijuiversity, and 'that these departments should be added, to its present curriculatu of instruction. ... The re comuiepdation may, be : objectionable for tvfo reasons. ' , ,. ' .' .-. .First, $ucb departments are generally consid ered' unusual uncongenial and misplaced in such connection. .. The tone .of life essbential to. a XUiversitj . would by. no means (promote the purposes' of the donation,1 and would,, most prob ably result in sinking the University to a mere College, or in he entire neglect of all practical application in the departments intended to be promoted by Congress. Second. The Constitution .does not require the Legislature to sustain the : University ex clusively. Any number of Institutions deemed necessary, might be promoted by the same au-. thority. Tbe University belongs legally. rtq tho whole ' State, but is practically used;, by a small number of the citizens. . ; All helped to build it and all help to pay the1 dooation given by the last Legislature, yet the majority of those who send their sons to schools of high grade; for reasons- satisfactory to themselves, prefer some other Institution. There aro east of the Blue'Ridge and Pedee river 30,000 members of the Methodist Church embraced' in the North Carolina, Conference. These Methodists havo built yp Trinity College, and at the late Con ference io: Fayette ville, resolved' unanimously to ufe allpropiir mcaosto sust'ain it. ; Trinity has received ny pecuniary aid since the surren der,1 and is in "'full .operation, with nearly as many students as' the ; University. -.The "libra riei, apparatus', and museum are very, little infe rior, , if any, to that at Chapel Hiif, . Now i if these public lands , are given to tbe University it will be, practically, depriving :the large 'citi zenship that favors Trinity of any beoefit from them. The same remarks would apply largely to tbe Baptists and' Presbyterians. Is such a courso either just or -advisable? .''. Why not do as -many other -States have?
