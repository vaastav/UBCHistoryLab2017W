We think the plan suggested by General Cowen, of appointing a sub-conimittre for each Bchool district is the best one, perhap;, that can be adopted, and therefore recom mend its adoption by you. By observing the rules as laid down in the circular, snd having each sub-committee rerort to their respective township committee, and they to the District Provost Marshal's, we believe the work can be nearly perfectly done. Jt is very important in making corrections that it be accurately done, 10 much so that you, or some one of your members, are willing to file your affidavit as to its correctness.

PAUL, Committee at Lzrge LATEST NEWS. The Richmond Enquirer has reason to be lieve that Sherman's army has united, and is inarching with increased pace towurd the coast. It anticipates a bailie ; at some point north or north-west of Savanuah. ore the ekisfi af the present week. The Richmond .M'AiV of tho Ct.li, learns that Wheeler has inflicted a sever blow up on the enemy, .Hid that Kilpatrick is wound el. The locality of tha tight is not given, for sufficient reasons. - Resolutions have been introduced into the Legislature of South Carolina, which de nounce the Administration of Jf ff. Davis, and especially tha ptpposition looking to conscription,' and suspending the writ of Habeas Corpus. The States are called up on not to submit to them. The Richmond DUpatch of the Cth thinks that Sherman is becoming more timid, and exhausted, and states that for the last five days he lias only lnadctive miles a day. He was expected at Savannh on the Sfith. Grant is moving, according to the Rich mond papers, on his extreme right, and an attack is expected by him. There is no change in the situation at Na-hviile. Prisoners report that Cheatham command the relle right, Loe the center, and Stewart the 'left. General Bur bridge and his command were at Bonn's Station on the 6th. Yaughan, the Confederate, was reported at C'hucdy Bend, with a heavy force, and Bushrod Johnson at Jonesboro; but both reporst are doubted at Louisviile. The Journal thinks Bwckindrige will turn up in a new and unexpected quarter before long. 6,0CK) troops, the Richmond papers state, h we passed down the Potomac to reinforce Grant. Ihe Richmond papers of the 7th say Sher man's campaign is diawingtoa close, and that he is approaching the eoat-t via Darwn and Savannah, but he wiil encounter a for midable force before reaching tho htttr place. The Londoa Timet hopes the Lincoln Ad ministration will not repeat the experiment of insulting and defying England. The Committee of W ays and Means in the House of Representatives, will, iti3thought, roport in favor of taxing tobacco in th leaf, and not the manufactured article. The Richmond papers of Wednesday pre dict the defeat of Sherman before he can reach Savannah or Darien. The Southern papers continue their spec ulations in regard to Sherman, but throw but little light upon his actunl movements. The Augusta Coiwtitutionaliiit thinks at the rate ho is now traveling, ho would reach Savannah by the 9th inst, provided he is not ft.'iacaaa.

Tha Prcidi'nt on taking the ehair, stated that the roll of members rhould have been called bafore the College was organized, but as it had been omitted, he would then call it. All the tuemtien answered to their names. The order of business adopted bv th College in lGO was then adopted. A committee of three, consisting of Mesers. Smith. Kcllogr. and Gunclel. was appoin ted to prepare the necewary forms for the lurtner aeuon ot the College. Un tnotiou, it was Iiaolvtd, That a Messenger be selected by lot. A motion v; made for the appointment of a committee of three cn mileage. An amendment was offered that the members donate their per diem and mileage to the camtary Commission. After sorue little conversation and jocose remarks among the mem Peru, t lie anumdmeut was withdrawn, and the orjgimil motion was put and carried. Meters. Waller, Green arid Wood, were ap pointed the committee on mileage. Dr. Jamas Williams, of this citv, then appeared at the right hand of the Fresi dent and invited the members of the College to an entertainment to be given them on tint (Wednesday) evening, by citizens t-f Col umbus. The invitation was accepted. It was then Toted that two messengers be se lected I. y lot. A motion was made to sui pend the rules in order to select the two Messengers. Un a rising vote only six members voted iu favor of the motion. It was, of course, lost. The Colloje then took a recess until half past eleven o'clock. 

HALF PAST ELEVEN. At IU o'clock, the College reassembled. The committee on Form submitted a report which was adopted. The duty of prepar ing transcripts of the forms was referred to the same committee. The following form of the tallot was then adopted: '"For Presideut of the United States for four years from the 4th of March, 1S05, "For Vice President of the United States for four years from the Uh of March, 1S05, The President called the roll and all the members were found to be present. At twelve o'clock, the electors at largo were called by name, and the Congressional Dis tricisby number, and the electors vast their votes for President, and on a like call, for Vice President. The President of the Col lege announced that twenty-one votes the whole number had been cast for Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, for 1 'resident, and the like number for Andrew Johnson, of Tenne ssee, for Viee President. Mr. Kellogg was. on motion, appointed Messenger to the District Judge, but at his request was excused from the service, and Judge Matthews appointed in his place. A Messenger was then selected by draw ing twenty blanks and one prize from a hat, as the names of members were called. William Sheffield was the lucky member who drew the prize of Messenger to Wash ington. The College then adjourned till three o' clock P. M. - tithes o'ri.nrK. At throe o'clock tho College reconvened. The requisite certificates and other official documents were then signed. The commit tee on mileage reported verbally that their report had been handed to the Governor, and that the members would receive certifi cates for their pay in the evening at the office of the State Auditor. The College then adjourned W die. Social Courtesies. We do not suppose there is a "really, truly, radically loyal" man in the country who docs not look on George H. Pendleton as a traitor. Folios have been written and hundreds of speeches marie to prove him so. We never believed him that, and in our in credulity have fometimes doubted the sin cerity of many who profesfed that they did. Be that as it may, what do our readers think of the following dispatch, which we find in a Chicago newspaper: Cincinnati, Dec. 1. Last evening a f'asliioinble party was given by Hon. Geo. H. Pendleton at his house. Between 500 ann 000 guests were in attendance, of all parties, including Gen. Hooker and Mr. Cha.se ' From the fact of such acknowledged Union men as either Gsn. Hooker and'ex Seerctary Chase being nt Mr. Pendleton's party, we conclude that etiquette makes a distinction between what people say and what they think, or that a person may be exceedingly dangerous as nn enemy of the country, and p. vet Lea marvellous proper man with whom to indulge in cordial social intereoun-e. There has been some sugges tion made that loyalists and disloyalists can not live together, but "Fighting Joe" and "Old Gveenbaeks",iri evidonly unbelievers in this doctrine of isolation. Seriously, for our part v,'e are g!a I te see such signs of pacific relations between men of different political parties. They do good by toning down partisan harshness, which tooofen runs into- personal bitterness. Their example is good, too, for mutual amenities teach that there are others in the world be sides ourselves, and that all the respectabil ity or the patriotism is not. conlned to our own accustomed circles. Mr. Pendleton was sensible to invite to his house representative men opposed to him in politics, and they in turn showed excellent sense in going. St. Louis ltepuhiic:r.i. Tux important fact remains demonstrated that we have morq men now than we had when the war began that we are not ex hausted, nor in process of exhaustion that we are gaining strength, and may, if need be. maintain the contest indefinitely. Lin coln Mcmiye. If we have more men than wc had when the war begun, why is it that labor is so high and so difficult to get? Never in the public remembrance was there such a dearth of hands. The troth is, we, have not any thing like the' number 'of able-bodied men that we had when the war begun, nnd any presumption to the contrary effect is the riost egregious folly. If we can maintain the contest indefinitely, why have the bonds of the Government gone down from par in specie to fifty cents below par? Cin. Enq. I'nexliausfablc Resources. Mr. Lincoln, in his late message, pays; 'Our material resources are now more complete and abutidunt than ever. The na tional resources, then, are unexhausted, and we believe unexhaustable." Therein is contained thetheory upon which Mr. Lincoln is conducting the war. He be lieves our national resources to bo "uiiex havxtaUe." He thinks there is no end to our men or money. Monstrous and prepos terous as ibis is, Mr. Lincoln affects to be lieve it. If we hav resources that are un exhaustable by profligacy and folly, we aro clothed with the attribute of omnipotence. The telegraph gives us a lengthy detail of Sherman's movements since he left Atlanta, as taken from the Southern papers. They predict that Sherman is directing his course toward Darien or Brunswick, It appears that Sherman was at Sandersville on the 26th. H! was at Milledgeville on the 25th, having arrived there on Sunday, tho 20th. When at Sandersville he was distant from Atlanta 125 miles. His army had destroy ed but little property up to last accounts. Wheeler was in close pursuit of Sherman's cavalry at Waynethoro. Tub President, in his message, is highly pleased with the National Bank system, which intelligent financiers in his own party consider opens tha way for the inauguration of more wild cat banks than were ever know 11 before in this country. Time will de velop tha value of the President's approval of tha aystcm.Oii. Enq. raxsi Cause r Defeat Li Kerr Terb. The Democracy in the State of New York, were beaten by the unwi and unpatriotic course of the New York News, and a lew of the cxtrt mists among the Democratic lead en who shared the fanaticism of its ediior. We say fanaticism for we have no where seen tauaticistii better exemplified titan in the case of the editor of the News. Because he could not get all the good that bed sired, he threw away the good that was attainable, and surrendered the Empire State to Black Republican rule. Between his journal, and the Despotism at Washington which hates a free press there is 110 longer any power to interpose for protection, and he will likely atone for his folly at the expense of the sup pression of his paper.

Banquet to the I'iesidcaitlal Electors. The outs who want to get in or, in other words, the Abolitionists of this citv, who are trying to secure the offices now held by some of the brethern of that persuasion and the men who are utter shoddy contracts, gave a "Banquet to the Fresidential Electors'' and a number of invited guests, last nitht. in Ainbo.s' Hall, which was. we arc told, large ly attended. A big amount of money was expended in getting up this entertainment by the office-seekers and contract-hunters, whiie many widows and orphans of dead sol diers are this morning in Columbus shiver ing and freezing for want of clothes and fire to keep them warm, and starving for want of food. For two days past we have notic ed in this nity, begging tor money, the wife of a man who lost an arm while firing a can non in Mt. Vernon at a jollification over the election of Lincoln and Delano. Some of the 'Loyal'' gentlemen who contributed to get up this Banquet have turned this poor woman awav empty handed, as we are advis ed, and without even so much as speaking to her a work ot encouragement. . "The Banquet" will be heralded by the 'loyal" press as a "'big thing," while the widows and orphans ot dead soldiers and the wife of the one-armed victim of a Delano jubilee, will receive neither notice, sympa thy, nor cash, from tha men who are just now after offices and contracts. Ohio Statesman, Dec. 7. Taxation aiad Heveiiue. The Washington correspondent of the N. Y. E;sprnu; says: The Pi blic' Lands. A great effort will b? made this scsion of Congress to gra.p more of the public lands in the now States and Territories for- railroads, wagon roads, horse and mule roads, and for all sorts of things as well as of roads. Tho whole pub lic domain is now deemed open for plunder. The Treasury Report and Finances. TheTreasnry Report, it id said, will get only $M,000,000 from internal taxes, from June 30, 1S63, to June 30, 1864, while un der the new tax law tha revenue will not have been much over $500,000 a day, at most $600,000, instead of a million, as expected. Expenses daily over three millions. High taxes often decrease, not increase, revenue, is a lesson yet to be learned by the Administration. The foreign import duties, especially upon liquors, have d creased the revenue thegefrntn. tThe greatest effort will be made to increase the duty on whis ky, but the better opinion now is that as to revenue measure, more money will be got from tho tax as it is, than if it were higher. " 1 ii Blow James K. I'olk was o rui nated. In its notice 6f the death of Col. Mcdarv, the Crisis says: In 1S44 bo was Chairman of the Ohio. Delegation to -the. Baltimore Convention. Anticipating the difficulties of that boister ous Convention, General Jackson wrote two letters one ti,t he Governor of New Hamp shire, who was Chairman of his State Dele gation, and one to Col. Medavy, in about these words: 'iAs the Inst effort 'for harmo ny present the name of James K. Folk, the ymmg hickory of Tennessee, to the Con vention.' This letter from the old hero was all that w.ts requisite. With this letter in his pos session, unknown to any one in the Conven tion, and without the knowledge, that anoth er letter of similar import, had been written to another member of the Convention. Col. Mcdary had soon made the arrangements which resulted in the nomination of James K. Polk, and saved the Democratic party from defeat. An Aduaixslon Too Late to be En tirely llancat. The Not York 7'W, of Novembsr 2S, in an article upon tho Presidential election, says: ( - -. " 'The party which has -just won the most decisive triumph ever achieved in a stub bornly contested Presidential election, as sumed the rratne of Union in no prescrip tive, no intolerant spirit. It has never doubted that the great mass ef the Ameri can people, irrespective of party lines, de sire the restoration and acknowledgement of the 'national authority throughout the whole area of t he republic. Those Americans who opposed the vindication by arms of the in sulted flag, the defied authority of the na tron, did not mean thereby to indicate hos tility to the Unio-)." This admission is father ton late to be en tirely honest. It is, nevertheless, valuable. For force years the Democracy have been accused of designs and of a policy which it is now admitted their opponents never believ ed. Good Pluck. The New Hampshire Democrats, who have just, emerged with great honor from an excited political con vass, are now entering a State campaign which will close by an election for Governor and Members of Congress fccnrly in March next, with all the energy and determination necessary to secure success. They aro thor oughly organized and in good fighting con dition, and we do not believe they will lose anything in the four months between No vember and March. : ' Tiie Debt. President. Lincoln is of the opinion that our national debt ''has become a substantial branch of national, though private proper ty." So far as the "nation is concerned, it is "property" that it would be happy to dispense with, give way to any body that will take it and pay the interest. It is a new thing to consider a debt valuable to those who have got to it. In one aspect only is it valuable. That i, when the party has had the beaefit of the debt and don't mean to pay it. Cin. Enq. ' A Curious Oversight. Tho Washington correspondent of the Gazette says: "The singular omission in the President's Message to say any thing of our relations with Great Britain and France, while dwell ing on those with minor powers, excitos com ment, and is by somo supposed to have a connection of some eort with the sudden de parture of Lord Lyons, but there is no rea son so regard it as mure than a curious oversight." Great Britian nnd Fiance have been so quiet about our affairs for the last year, that it was not rcuiarkabte the President had for gotti their existence. ' 

STATE COSVEffTIOS OF COl'.w TUT I'i;ilLIUEft3. Cuf'ijtvitxt, Dec., 6, Pe.R Sir: We propose to our brethren of the Weekly Press of Ohio, that th-y hold a Convention, at Columbus, on the Pirrt Wtdnestiay in Janwirff, t65, to de liberate on their busineiw interests, and to adopt a uniform Seals of Prices lorsubscrip tion and advertising. Much good can be accomplished by the interview. All who cons, nt to attend the Convention wi'J please indicate it, in thir respective journals, and sedd a marked copy of their paiers to the Circleville L'nu.n, with the un derstanding that we piiblish a Call lor a Convention, embracing ' their signatures, on or before the 25th day ofDecciiiber, in the Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland papers. We assume this responsibility in consider ation of the fact, that, with one or two ex ceptions, we are the oldest Editors and Pub lishers in tha Sa'o. We have never had an Editorial Conven tion, composed exclusively of weekly pub lishers, such as the one proposed. As a general rule, the city press is hostile to the country press, and the result was that for mer Conventions composed of both classes, have been failure?. Whatever may lie the result of our delib erations, one tiling is certaiu: we cannot fad to have a pleasant social interview. Therefore, resolve to be'pre.seot at the time indicated. W. H. P. DENNY, Proprietor Cirdeville Cnim. SAMUEL FTKK, Proprietor Washington Pegister, . "jWe fully endorse tho above call for a "State Convcntiou of Country Publishers," of Ohio, at Columbus on the first Wednes day of January, 1N65, and shall endeavor to be present, if the Convention is held. ' Opposed to the I'nlon. President Lincoln, in his late annual mes sage, says: "Judging by the recent canvass and its result, the purpose of the people within the loyal Mates to maintain the integrity ot the Union, was never more firm nor more unani mous than now. The extraordinary calm ness and good order with which tho millions of voters metjind mingled, at the polls, gave strong assurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket, to called. but a great majority of the opposing party may be fairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose." Alter this testimony from the head of the Republican party and its elected Chief, we ban1 a right to expect that its orators and journals will cease to accuse the Democracy of being opposed to tiic Union. No fair and sensible man ever did believe a word of it. ihe calumny has served its purposes for the election. Now let it rest. Auoliici' Draft. Before the election we were told that if Lincoln were re-elected there would never be another man drafted for this war. It now appears, however, that there will soon, be another call, and the authorities are pre paring for the work. A modification of the existing conscription law will probably be the lirst subject that wiil engage the atten tion of Congress. Thccauses for exemption will be lessened, and tho substitute system will likely be abolished. It is believed also that the men will bo drafted for three years. At all events it is certain that a new and heavy draft is inevitable. There is but lit tle doubt that the last man will be reached this time. Another draft, and yet another and an other, follow as the necessary, logical re sult of Mr. Lincoln's re-election. The ma jority of the people decided by their votes on tne sin 01 ixovemocr, mat t lie war should go on that there should be no efforts for re,- conciiliation and peace, but the war should be vigorously prosecuted until the Southern whites were all subjugated, and the negroes all freed. It costs as we know by four years experience, just about 300,000 men a year, killed or disabled, to carry on the war. The 300,0t)0 fresh men per annum, must be had, and it lliey won t step forward voian tarially, they will be forced in bv the mer- eilesi machinery of the draft. Every man who voted for Abraham Lin coln is morally bound to respond to this jew call with alacrity, and shoulder Ins mus ket and be off to the front. The govern ment appeals to their patriotism to come forward and till up the thin and war-shaUcr-ed ranks of our armies in the field, to carry on their war for ''impartial freedom" for negroes. Let not the appeal be made in vain. "Rally rouud the flag boys." Geurnsey Jrjf. Enrollment and Commutation In Oblo. The National enrollment officers for the State of Ohio returned 320.000 males be tween the ages of twenty and forty-five, sub ject to military duty. Tho returns of the Assessors of the State under the militia law show a male population between eighteen and forty-five of only 280,000 making a differnce of 40,000 men. Either the Na tional return or is too high, or the State too low. The State Journal says there can be no doubt but the national enrollment is somewhat in excess of the what it should be and that representations are now being made to the Washington authorities. which, it is believed, will result in a material reduction of the above figures how much cannot be said, but perhaps 20,000. The journal also thinks that probably not less than 40,000 male3 between eighteen and.forty-five, were not enumerated at all last spring by the As sessors. The State commutation fund has thus been deprived of a heavy revenue, at. the rate of four dollars per man. Cleveland Herald. The Case Generally. The Ashabu!a Sentinel enys that in eon sequence of the shortness of the notico and the unfavorable condition of the weather, very little was done in that county in te sponse to the Governor's Proclamation calf ing upon the people to make a jubilee for the Soldiers' Families on tho Saturday fol lowing Thanksgiving d'iy. From on3 cause and another, very little was done in any of the counties for that purpose. One year ago people responded more promptly to snch calls than they do now. The fact is, the war is beginning to weigh heavily upon the people; but this is no reason why Sol diers' families, and the poor generally, should he allowed to go nnenred for now when winter is upon us. Statesman. TnE Boston Traveler publishes a list of one hundred and three persons in that city whose annual incomes are above $25,000, as returned tinder the special income tax. Ten tax-payers in the Fourth district are assessed upon incomes of more than $100, 000 each, after the deductions allowed by law were made. One gentleman, Mr. Na thaniel Thayer, has the comfortable income of $365,150. There are about thirty pet persons in the same district who are taxed on incomes of $50,000 and under 00,000. The Duty or Postmasters. When newspnpors are not taken" out of tha office, we believe tho law requires the Postmaster to return them promptly. We sometimes have papers returned without any rr.ark or name to indicate where they come from. Ohio Democrat. It is the duty of the Postmaster to write a letter to the publisher, notifying him of the name of the person who does not lift tho paper and the reason assigned if any. If the Postmaster fail to do this, he is lia ble to tho publisher for tho full price of sub scription. A return of the paper by Post masters is not a legal notico. The first States to ratify the Federal Con stitution of 1789 were Now Jersey and Del aware.

We have reason to believe that all the preliminaries have been settled, even to tue concurrence of the f res ident and of General Grant It is a "big thing," but the misfortune of it all is, .that it is nothing more than a private specula tion, in wmcn twenty oua minions 01 uouars at the least, are involved. As the story goes, E. D. Morgan, of New York, a Senator in Congress, Henry J. Raymond, of the New York 7Yn, and Chairman of the Republican National Con vention, to rc-eJect Mr. Lincoln President; Thurlow Weed, who was opposed to, and only gave a reluctant as;ent to the re-election of Mr. Lincoln, and a fourth party, who was the negotiator, and had a carte Unncht to pass to and from Richmond, are to bo bene ficiaries of this arrangement. They agree to supply all the clothing, blankets and oth er necessaries for the rebel prisoners in the United States, and in return are to receive in their own right thefnll amount in cotton at a stipulated price, but far below the actual value in Now York or England, and they of course pocket the difference. It is, as we have said, a "big thing"' for them, and very possibly a good thing for the rebel prisoners in rue union; put wny aid not our authori ties make the arrangement for their own ac count, unl thereby relieve the people to the extent of afew millions of dollars, now to be paid to individuals? Is Brief. Time and tide will wait for no man. Neither will the draft. We have a glorious couutry for office holders and niters. A littlelearning is a dangerous thing. What little we have learned of tha Abo lition party places this fact beyond contro versy. The abolitionists have winning ways par ticularly in election. It is said poverty is honorable. If so. what an hrmorahlo country we will have at the end of Lincoln's next term if things go on as they have been doing. It is strange ih ittho most noi y war men prefer the front rank of an oftVe to the rear rank in an army. IMmes Countj Far mer. CSTThe following is an extract from the President's message: "I regard our emigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are ap pointed by Providence to repair tho rava ges of internal war, and its waste of nation al strength and health. All that is necessa ry is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness, and to that end the Gov ernment must, in every way, make it mani fest that it neither needs nor designs to im pnsj involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country." The effect of this policy, continued for years, would destroy the native-Wii popu lation North ami South, leaving their mher itance to the European emigrant in the North and the negro in the South. Alien races would divide our country between them. A Foul Deed. A living chiM was founrl 00 Saturday night lass, about 9 o'clock, in a privy in Ca nal Dover. It had evidently been just de posited there, as the inhuman mother or somo other person was seen leaving the premises. .Its piteous cries were distinctly, heard for the first time in this "most f'ou and unnatural" place, and "Ou fts cheek tho tear that nature bid it weep," was almost frozen to an icicle. By the aid of some humane individuals the child was rescued from this horrible place and will he properly cared for. It is to be hoped the perpetrator of this outrage upon decency and humanity niay vet be discovered and receive condign puuishment. Ario Piiil. Dem. Dec, 9. The spirit of Democracy. The late city election in Hartford, Con necticut, was carried by the Democracy, by a majority of 102. The total vote was 4,557. It was a square fight between the Democracy and their opponents. The result occurring since the Presidential election, shows how much truth there is in the statement of the Republican papers that tho Democratic par ty is dead. Cin. Enq. Army Uniforms. A recent order of the War Department, gives official authorization to the practice which has already become al most universal among army officers, with re ference to the wearing of badges indicative of rank. It permits officers to dispense with shoulder-straps, and the prescribed insignia' of rank on their horse equipments. The marks of rank to be worn on the shoulder strap will henceforth be worn on the shoul der. They will also be permitted to wear overcoats, pants, &c., similar to those worn by private soldiers ; nor are ornaments on the hats, overcoats, or forage caps, sashes, or epaulets longer required.
