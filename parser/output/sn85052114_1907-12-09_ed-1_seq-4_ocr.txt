OTHER VIEW OF IT The pwensboro Messenger bump tiously says A neighboring dally boasts that It printed the presidents message in full more than twenty columns but liberal reward probably could not discover one of Its readers who will admit that be read all of It The Messenger confesse tb have printed sixcolumn synopsis of It but the Now York World the greatest Amen can newspaper boiled it down to less than three coljimna Of all our presi dents Roosevelt haaprove the most prolix Ho discusses everything un der tho sun In his messages and makes recommendations to congress of legislation on most frivolous sub jects which congress never notices Ills last message was In largo part but a repetition of tho speeches he has mado In different parts of the country Our boastful contemporary would have been more enterprising had It done as the Messenger did but tho World beat us all In handling the message To put It otherwise the Messenger says that Its subscribers ehaM read only so much ol the presidential mes sage as the Messenger deems It worth while for them to see Gum

if you will put your head in the traps Ill do my best to make it safe after you git it there You Jlst sit still honey And she took the candle and went to a corner where she seated herself at a stand havek some difficulty in arranging her words to her liking She seemed to be writ ing but tho pen did not flow smoothly At last she was done and sealing her work In on envelope sho brought the

good Its tho best I can do for ye Youd better mayo need It I thanked Mother Borton and pressed her hand and she held the candle as I tiptoed down the stairs Joining my waiting guards and went out Into the night Where are Barkbouso and Phil lips I asked as We turned our faces toward the west Porter gave a low whistle and as this failed to bring an answer fob lowed it with one louder and more pro longed Wo listened but no response saids came Wilson Theres no telling what may happen when they hear that whistle lUst Whats raft said Porter drawing me back Into a doorway There were running steps on the block above us and I thought a shad ow darted from one side of the street to the other There seem to be friends waiting for us said I Just get a good grip of your clubs boys and keep your revolvers handy In case they think they have a call to stop us Hold on said Porter Theres a gang of em there I see a don f em and If were the ones theyre after we had better cut for It 1 believe you

for you to risk It Theres no need for any one to risk It Well cut together I This way then said Wilson I know this part of town better than you do Run on your toes And he darted past Bortona and plunged into an alley that led toward the north Porter and I followed as quietly as possible through the dark and noisome cutoff to Pacific street Wilson turned toward the bay and crossing tho street

stepped out of tho hark and looked I about me anxiously Was I to meet the Unknown or was I to take orders from some emissary of my hidden em ployer No answering eye met mine as I eearchpd the place with eager glance Neither woman nor man of all the hurrying crowd had a thought of me I glanced at the clock that ticked I the seconds In the office of tho hotel I I saw that I had been early and that It was even now but 20 minutes to the hour The minute band had not swapt past tI tho figure Mil when the door opened there was a hurried step and two women stood before me leading a child between them Both women were closely veiled and tho child was mut fled and swathed till Its features could not be seen OnQ of tho women was young the other olderperhaps middleaged Both were tall and wellmade I looked eagerly upon them for one of them must be the Unknown the hidden em ployer whose task had carried Henry Wilton to his death wild held my life In her hands and who fought the des perate battle
