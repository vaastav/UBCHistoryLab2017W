The Arizona Citizen TTJCSOIV, PDIA COUNTY. Sat xi relay, December 17, '70 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. "We predicted last -week the receipt of the message in time for notice to day, but had The San Diego Union not gone to the expense of having the entire document specially telegraphed it from San Francisco, the citizens of Tucson would not have read it this -week. The S. D. Bulletin reprinted it from The Union, and altogether it was pretty extensively circulated here Thursday morning. The Union, for a 'country weekly,' on that score, can go 'up head.' The message was deliver ed Tuesday, the 5th, and in quantity of matter it would half fill this sheet, or nearly, in this type. In quality, we think it less subject to criticism on the part of people or politicians, than any of Grant's pen-productions sinco his grand summing up of the war. No question expected, is avoided, and all are treated in an unequivocal style ; it is evidently all his own. He reads John Bull a lesson on the hackneyed 'Alabama Claims' unpleasantness that is refreshing for once in a long time : wants Congress to properly present the bill, and he guarantees a peaceable and honorable settlement for both And he talks to the mother country more 'like a father' on her shabby treatment of Young America on the great lakes and river St. Lawrence ; in short, ho twits tho British Lion in a way that ho will 'roar again.' The President insists at length and stoutly upon the early acquisition of tho island (Repub lic) of St. Domingo, and we think such a foot-hold would bo the entering wedge to ultimate establishment of tho Monroe Doctrine, which ho says ought to be held more sacred than ever. He refers to his recognition of tho French republic as a matter of sympathy and abstract right, but wants no hand in European troubles. "Wants united ac tion to protect citizens in China ; wants the shipping interest assisted, and ad vises farther subsidy of Pacific marine. "Wants the settler's rights particularly guarded on the public lands. "We have room this week but for the annexed paragraphs in full the first doubtless refers to the Lower California schemes and the second explains itself: It is to be regretted that our repre sentations in regard to the in jurious effects (especially upon the revenue of the United States) of the policy of the Mexican Government in exempting from import duties a large tract of its territory on our borders, have not on ly been fruitless, but that it is even proposed in that country to extend the, limits within which the privilege has hitherto been enjoyed. I would sum up the policy of the Administration to bo : A thorough en forcement of every law; a faithful collection provided for revenue, and economy in the disbursements of the same ; a prompt payment of the debt of the nation ; a reduction of the taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will admit of a reduction of taxation; and a tariff to be so arrang ed, as to afford the greatest good, to the greatest number ; honest and fair dealings with all other peoples, to the end that Avar with all its blighting con sequences may be avoided, but without surrendering any right or obligation due to us ; a reform in the treatment of the Indians, and in the whole Givil Service of the country, and finally, in securing a sure, untrammeled ballot, when every man now entitled to cast a vote may do so, just once, at each e lection, without fear of molestation or persecution on account of his political faith, nationality or color. 

IXDIAX Murdered. Gov. Saf ford issued a proclamation, calling on the authorities and all persons to ar rest if possible the white man (?) or men who murderedja Hualapai Indian, while scouting near Prescott lately. The Indian was acting as scout for the party, someof whom overtaking uu murdering him, so as to have it to say that they had taken a scalp. The Indian is a bad enough animal, rrhen he gets down to it, but there are mtrt&js porsons of the white or sup jiKsed civilized races, that can dis jount him at his worst. The hostile Indians of Arizona have oeen on their good behavior sometime He is Not to Blame. Deficient by nature and education in the first instincts of a gentleman, ruined in purse and reputation, failing in blackmailing or injuring any one by his slanders, the junior member of tho Duffield firm is fast grinding out the laws preparatory to packing the carpet bag he talks so much about and leaving the country. "When ho goes, he will leave no void in thi3 community that cannot be filled with mud or clay of equal dimensions. Never occupying a position until re cently, except that of servitude, he could not stand tho elevation of being treated as an equal, and ho sunk in the mire of his own ignorance and in famy. "We repeat he is not to blame. "We suppose God made him, and we charitably believe for somo good pur pose, certainly not for the editor of a newspaper. Even his partner would not claim him a success in that re spect. But we will not delve into the mys terious workings of Deity to attempt to find out what he was made for. It is sufficient for us to know that his carpet bag is packed, the publication of the laws is nearly completed, the circulation of his paper has dwindled to nothing, and very soon we shall know him and his little sheet no more forever. As hospital steward, his indolence and impudence brought him before a court martial ; as a "dog robber," he tasted his master's wines and liquors bo extensively, and ran his anus to tho elbows so frequently into his pre serves, that ho proved an utter failure in that position ; and when he paid his way to this town in the capacity of a cook for a train, we are assured that charity alone caused the humane train master to tolerate him in that po sition to keep him from starving. "Wo intended that the foregoing art icle, first published last week, should bo fully conclusive on the subject in question ; but by particular request on the part of old residents well posted, and who vouch for the perfect charac ter of the sketch in every feature, it is reproduced. But we te i those gentle men that tho game was not worth ono iota of the space devoted to it, and that this littlo paper (Tiie Citizen) has a better mission for every line of its columns, and it shall be the earnest endeavor to crowd it hereafter with the news and practical ideas of Territorial affairs, stated in a clear and readable style. It shall be as a good egg full of meat, and welcome on every table. There has ever been a want of such a sheet in Arizona, and it will be as safe an investment as tho community can find for the money. According to all the indications we have ever seen, there has never been anything but a questionable shapo of a newspaper in this part of Arizona ere the advent of The Citizex. The subject of the above sketch has been thoroughly dissected tried and found wanting in every journalistic sense ; in short, we doubt if a committee of rag-and-bone pickers or night-workmen, in the liight of charity, would place it on the list of what political economists designate as useful nuisan ces ; there being nothing of the phos phorous remaining but the perfumery. For as a specimen of 'the art pre servative,' it is a repulsive commentary and reflection upon the crudest style of printing since the inventor (Dr. Faust) was in league with the devil, its ex istence from first to last has been but a flickering one (through general busi ness, incapacity depending on passages of the hat, yet snapping at the hands that fed and be-friendedit, and damn ed by all who have ever had anything to do with it), always bordering on final dissolution, in shape and substance, excepting the sweet-scentedness, &c. ; on this head, the person or thing whose name appears in all the rural impor tance and big type of 'editor,' would have the reader (it may have one be side himself) to infer that he is one of those would-be extra-nice bodies, who are so replete with natural nastiness that they hesitate in their language for want of suitable words to conceal their ruling qualities. Dean Swift, tho chief of satirists, pronounces these the most contemptible of all creatures of 'the human form divine.' Lotekia. Los voletos dc la loteria " de A. & L.
