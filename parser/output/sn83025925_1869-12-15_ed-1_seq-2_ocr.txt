We hove bad a number of cable dospntches within the Inst few days, from which we may lorivo BHHuranoe that before a very grfat jrhile we will be in telegraphic) coinninnica Jion with China and Japan, as well as the Ea-st Indies and other parts of the Oriental world. Our readers are aware that the Oreat Eastern Is at this time engaged in the work of laying a cable along the bed of the Arabian Sea ana the lied Sea, between JJombay and Suez, a distance which will require a cable line of the length of 4X)0 statute miles, or as great a length as the cable between France and this country. This line, in connection with the Alexandria and Malta line, already in exist n will brinar India into immediate com munication with Europe while we in this country w ill also, of course, bo able to re cofvo our daily despatches of East India affairs. . Already preparations have been made for the extension of this line to China. We had a London despatch last week announcing the formation of a company there to lay a sub marine cable between Bombay and Hong Kong, and we know that this is but the carry ing out of a project for which preparations were niado some time ago. There is now no difficulty abojit obtaining capital for cable companies in London; and the English facili ties for cable-making and cable-laying have become so great that we may reasonably ex pect to see the Bombay and Hong Kong line in full operation before the close of the com ing year. When, by this means, London is enabled to hold daily communication with the Chinese Empire, New York will of course enjoy the same privilege; and Xoopmanschap in San Francisco will be able to telegraph to China for emigrants, not in a westerly direction, as ought to be the ease, but by long easterly lines of wires and cables, via New York, London, Malta, Suez, and Bombay to Hong Kong. The English have undoubtedly got the start of us, as well as of the rest of the world, in this matter of telographio communication with China and the countries of the Orient; and the English will undoubtedly derive the greater part of the advantages from tho connection thus established. But we do not propose to worry over the matter. We ourselves will use the lines as much as we may need them in tho meantimo; and wo are quite sure in time to have our own cables across tho Pacific, as the precursors of a commerce certain yet to attain stupendous proportions. We have, moreover, had the assurance, within the last few days, of the establishment of another cable line in another part of the world, that may also bring us into telographio communication with the Chinese Empire. Our St. Petersburg despatch of the 8th announced that the Czar of llussia had granted the authorization to a company to fay a submarine cable connecting some point on tho coast of Asiatic llussia with China and Japan touching the Chinese territory, we suppose, at Shanghai, whence connections with the other Chinese ports will be formed by the linos of the American Company which baa already received the necessary concessions from the Pekin Government. The Eusso Chinese cable will connect with St. Peters burg by the great overland Russian lines (not yet completed), and it will be quite pos sible for us to establish a connection be tween it and our American telegraph system. We are now engaged in extending our wires in a northerly direction along the Pacific coast, and there is not the slightest doubt I &at they will advance till they have stretched J cross British Columbia and reached Alaska. 5 from our telegraph stations there, it will J lot be a very difficult matter to lay a cable j cross the straits which separate our territory I rom that of Asiatio Russia, thus forming a jonneotion with the Kusso-Chinese line and establishing telographio communication round the globe. To observe that this will be the case when the projects now being prosecuted are com plcted, let us commence at any point of the circle. Say we begin at New York, from which we may move in either direction; but let us pass westwardly to San Francisco, northwardly to Alaska, across Behring's ; fttraits to the Kusso-Asiatio cable, which car i lies us to China; thence to Bombay by the projected English line; from there to Suez, 1 Malta, and London, and onward to our point of departure at New York by the Atlantic cable. Or suppose we take another point at the opposite side of the world let it be Hong Kong, for example. The merohant or corre spondent there can telegraph to New York by two lines running in opposite directions. He can send his despatch to us by way of Bom bay, Suez, London, and the Atlantic cable; or he can send it to us by way of tb,e Kusso Asiatio line, Alaska, San Francisco, and the overland wires. We trust that this ltusso Asiutio line, as well as the British Bombay line tChina, will be constructed and brought into HucVassful oporation. llussia has great interests in China and a vast commerce with China. The establishment of this line of telegraphic communication would be of in calculable advantage to llussia. That it would also be of great advantage to us is unques tionable. SINISTER INFLUENCES AT WASHING TON MR.-- TRUMBULL'S REMEDY. frmn the N. Y. I'imnt. If Senator Trumbull really desires to pro mote the efficiency of the civil service, main tain the dignity of Representatives and Sena tors in Congress, ana restore integrity in legislation, he could, one would suppose, find ample opportunity for tho furtherance of his purposes without making it a crime for a Re presentative to give the Executive correct information touching the fitnen of applicants for office. To give such information, whether at is required or not, is not only the right but the duty of every member of Congress; and the fact that .we may occasionally have an Executive who docs not seek such informa tion, or who disregards it when given, only Tenders the performance of the duty on the part of the Representative still more impera tive, lie wno gives mis uiioriuauon iroia sense of public duty is a public benefactor and not a criminal. It is the abuse of the privilege wnicn Tneir position gives to members of iJongreua that needs to be oorrected. , Hud. Senator Trumbull pro Tided acainst the abuse of the system, and, while preserving the right of recommenda tion, only sought to regulate tho manner of its exercisej had. he provided in his bill that all recommendations should be in writinor. and be plaoed on file; that any Representative who should endorse more than one person for the same office, or who . should, after having recommended pne .for an office seoretly op. pose hifl appointment without withdrawing j'ia rooomineadtttiott. Ott file; and had he THE DAILY" EVENING further declared that any membor of Oon-' grem who ahonld support an applicant for i office for a pecuniary consideration, or in pursuance of any corrupt agreement or un derstanding or that any Sonator or ltopre sentative who should receive any money or other valuable consideration from an ofuae holdcr whose appointment ho had roaom mended, should be guilty of a niujdomoanor bo would have struck at a growing evil, oon vinoed the people of the sincerity of his effort to effect a reform in the abuses oonnected with the administration of the Government, and commended his proposition to the fa vorable consideration of the people. But when he attempts to convert an act of duty into a misdemeanor, it will bo diffloult for him to convince the peoplo that his measure is not absurd as well as unjust. The Senator having undertaken, however, to regulate the abuses arising out of the in tercourse between members of Congress and Uio Executive Department, and to read a lec ture on Congressional dignity and depart mental independence all of which we admit was much needed his attention may be callod to one or two additional abuses in. this connection which seem to us worthy his at tention. First in order, then, is the practice of mem bers mixing in the controversies which arise between the departments and the taxpayer. In 1H5:( an act of Congress was passed which prohibited any Senator or Ilepresentative in CongTess from acting, "for any compensation paid or agreed to be paid, as agent or attorney in prosecuting any claim against the United States." The letter of this aot, strictly con strued, docs not, perhaps, prevent mombors of Congress from acting as claim agents, provided their compensation is political support, given or to be given, rather than "a compensation paid or to be paid." And possibly it cannot be said to prohibit them from defending claims which the Govern ment may make against the citizen. But it is very clear that the evil which Congress sought to remedy was the exercise of Con gressional influence upon clerks and the sub ordinates of departments before whom these claims were pending. The spirit of this statute, if not its letter, is habitually violated. Go into the Intornel ltevenue Department any morning between the hours of 'J and 12, and you willsee Representatives waiting in the ante-room to obtain an interview with the head of the department respecting some controversy involving money, which has arisen between a constituent and the Govern ment. In important controversies between the department and great whisky or tobacco thieves, you may be sure that in a majority of cases the thief will either directly or in directly be represented before the department by his member of Congress. HOLDING BACK ON THE CUBAN QUES TION WHAT DOES IT MEAN? From the If. T. Berald. Every one asks with some surprise what the apparently pro-Spanish policy of the adminis tration and the seemingly studied reticence of Congress on the Cuban question mean. Even those members of Congress who are most pronounced and advanced in favor of Cuban independence or annexation are holding baok. Monster petitions to Congress, with seventy thousand signatures, for the recognition of Cuban belligerency or independence are laid aside for the present, and that upon the mo tion of members who have been the warm friends of Cuba. Months ago the President did not hesitate to express opinions highly favorable to the Cubans. The Secretary of State was scarcely less sympathetic and hope ful for Cuba than his chief. All this is on record. Our Mini.si.or r. Madrid was in structed to tell tho Spuui.ih Government, nearly nine months ago, that publio opinion in the United States was so strongly in favor of the Cubans that the administration and Congress would bo compelled at no distant day to recognize them. At the end of the session of Congress last spring, the House of Representatives passed a resolution unani mously expressing sympathy with the Cubans in then: struggle for freedom and authorizing the President to recognize thorn. It is known, too, that our Government made an effort, about the same time, to negotiate with Spain for the independence of Cuba. Nor should it be forgotten that the seizure and detention of the Spanish gunboats for a time naa no real relation to 1'eru. Ho, one had any idea that these gunboats would or could be used against Peru. The Govern ment knew this, and, therefore, usinar the Peruvian Minister or the pretended quant war with Peru in the matter was mere pre text. There is no doubt that the object at the time was to serve the Cubans in an in direct way. Everything tended to show that the Government and people of the United States were steadily advancing to a point when this country would interpose in some way or other in favor of Cuban independence. Everybody expected it, the press anticipated it, and the poor Cubans were inspired with hope by it. That was the Btate of the ques tion up to two weeks ago, and a great deal was expected from the President and Con gress, or from Congross, at least, as soon as the session commenced. General Grant sail even to one of the Cuban Junta, in an inter view ten days since, that Congress would take prompt action on the subject of Culm. But we aro not willing to believe the ad ministration is aiming to assist the Spaniards and to crush the Cubans, notwithstanding the language of the President's message and the release of the Spanish gunboats. SVe are dis posed to believe there may be some over tures from Spain some professed disposition on the part of that power to opou negotia tions for the sale or cession of Cuba, and that our Government is desirous to conciliate the Spaniards and to save their pride from being wounded, so that the object may bo accom plished under the form of friendship. The extraordinary attentions to General Sickles, our Minister at Madrid, lately, give color to this opinion. We cannot believe that the Government, and least of all that General Grant, would take the back track in the Cuban question for fear of war with Spain. Such a bngboar would not disturb the , most nervous old fogy if he had any sense. But if the seeming pro Spanish and anti-Cuban policy of the admin istration arises from any new movement on the part of Spain to negotiate for the sale or independence of Cuba, it may bej vell to warn the Government against any possible Spanish treachery, so that it may not aid tho Spaniards in their atrocious system of 'war on Cuba for the sake of a remote contingency. If our Government be too yielding and tender in its friendship for Spain on such a prospect, it may bo cheated and be laughed at by the wholo world for its simplicity and folly! The only way to treat Spain and this Cuban question is in the boldest manner and on the principle of a broad American policy, independent of what the rest of the world may think or say. 

PCTULA1UTY ' Or GENERAL GRANT'S MESSAGE IN CONGRESS. from the N. T. World. Tbe Time, which devoted a long editorial on Hobday to asporuiona of the Demooratio TELEGRAPH PHILADELPHIA, SVEDNE3DAY, bflCEMBER 15, 18G9. party, had, in the same number, tho follow ing servile and syoophantio tribute to Presi dent Grant, tolegraphed from its regular Washington correspondent: , "Wariiinoton, Doo. 11. It Is strictly anotirftte to nay that the reception of tho president's niesfMirn Iijr CotiRrcHg has been marked tT a spirit of hi-arty con currence bdiI general satisfaction such as naa not beon exhibited since tho last tnesHiigo of Mr. Lin coln. It has broiiRht back tno days of nappy accord and complete harmony between Congress and the administration, which result must Inevitably bo felt throughout tho country. There aro portions of tho inensHKe, of oourse, whloh do not meet with unani mous approval.; hut these exceptions disappear In the heurty approval of the tone of tho messiio and the general arlmimtton f tho terse and perspicuous manner In which tun President states his arguments, facts, ami suggestions when he gets fairly beyond his introduction. There aro even somo soncenccs whloh are models of condonscd thought and coin pact expression. Directness of statement was always a charactctlstlo of Woneral Grant's orders, letters, and reports; and that part of the message devoted to direct statements which la tho larger part fully sustains his reputation in this respect." This fulsome praise of a weak President betokens as little judgment or discrimination as tho Times' tirade against the Democratic party. President Grant has convinced Con gress that he is so little formidable, either by his own sagacity or by the talents and influ ence of his Cabinet, that there is no neces sity for making any laborious attempt to thwart him. The ascendancy which Congress has arrogated for the last four or five years is in so little danger from so feoble a President that its members feel that there would be more scandal and damage to their party in a quarrel than gain from openly bridling an officer who is such a cipher in politics. If, as General Grant's sycophant asserts, his recent message brings him a rich harvest of Congressional popularity, tho natural con sequence would be the adoption of all his leading recommendations. But there are, as yet, no symptoms that any of (hem will be successful. In what he said about Cuba he did not propose any action by Congress, but only explained his own position on a subject which is outside the legislative province. There is no unanimous acquiescence by Con gress in that part of his message. On Mon day, Mr. Carpenter, the popular Republican Senator from Wisconsin, offered a bill to prevent the departure of the Spanish gun boats; and Mr. Davis, the ablest Republican Representative from this State, proposod tnat tno i'resident should be asked if he desired now legislation to enable him to take sides with the Cubans. This topic excites more popular feeling than any other touched in the message; and although the President's position on it is correct, it is certain that it does not meet the general ap probation of the Republican membors. His past action on this subject, and his sudden change of front, have placod the Republican press, and most of the Republican members, in a false position. His seizure and detention of the gunboats, and the sympathy he has in various ways manifested for the insurgents, gave a cue which his party was too eager to follow; and now, after they have boon com mitting themselves for so many months to the cause of the insurgents, it is very awk ward for them to be required to "turn their backs upon themselves," and support the President in frowning down a movement which he and they have so long abetted. On this question, surely, the message is not re sponded to with unanimous plaudits, and it has brought him no increase of popularity. 

LAXITY OF DIVORCE. From the Chicago Republican. It i a painful fact iu tho very painful cose now so prominently before the publio that the more one scrutinizes it the more offensive grow its details. Tho Indiana divorce of Mrs. McFarland seoins indeed to have been one of the cruelest of burlesques onhonorablo legislation. Induced to leave her husband without a single warning note, Mrs. McFarland appears to have settled in In dianapolis for nothing else than to bridge over, as slightly as possible, the gulf fixed be tween Richardson and herself. She first files a petition for divoroe before Judge Woolen (it is well that we have his name) on the ground of her husband's intemperate habits and ill-treatment of herself. Not a word in it, however, about the crime with which Mr. Beecher did not scruple to charge him. Affidavit is made that the unsus pecting McFarland is not a resident of tne btate, ana men ne is notified by "the Morgan County Gazette, a weekly newspaper of general circulation," ac cording to its proprietor, that the suit is pro ceeding. Probably not being a subscriber and regular reader of this "weekly newspaper of general circulation," McFarland does not reply, and the trial goes forward. The wit nesses are Mrs. McFarland'a father, and one Mrs. Lucia Gilbert Calhoun, who, by the way, will have to be exonerated by forthcoming testimony of a great deal of present suspicion if she cares to stand well with publio opinion. The father's story is go vague that one shivers to think of the dangers that environ the hap piest couples in the world. lie "specifies abuse and violence" by testifying that his son-in-law used to rave when intoxicated, and break the plates and dishes. Suddenly looms up tho Hon. A. G. Porter, who vouohes for Mrs. McFarland's respectability, having been introduced to her by the "most resectable people iu New York;" and modestly requests the divorce as a personal fuvor. Then we have Mrs. Lucia Gilbert Calhoun, who gives hearsay evidence that McFarland used to get drunk, and alleges mat sue once naw mm iu a stute ot intoxica tion. As to the abuse and ill-treatment, she only knows what Mrs. McFarland told her. If Mrs. McFarland had had no interest in the result, this kind of testimony would have been execrable in itself; but as she was in tensely concerned, her diluted and distorted assertions were terribly out of place. Yet, on the strength of this flimsy evidence, Judge wooieu iirestno train wnicn nas expioUod so disnstrouhly, by handing over Mrs. McFarland to the arms of Richardson and the sympathy of "the Gilbert girls." Surely this Judge Woolen could never have contemplated such an awful comment on his loose ruling. He could never have reflected on the woes and the misery and the scandal which were latent in his decree of divorce. Rut the lesson has been read, and the community still rings with its dismal echoes. The scandalous laxity of law and the parody of justice have for once been brought face to face with the fate that sbould always attend them. Whether the effect will be lasting; whether its solemn protest wi!l be always quick and vital, we do not know, and cannot assume. Rut we trust the notoriety and inquiry "the case bus excited may result beneficially to publio morals and the means of get ting us back nearer to the ancient landmarks, when marriHgo was a sacred bond, entered into for this life and the one beyond, and not to be loosely severed by human agencies.
