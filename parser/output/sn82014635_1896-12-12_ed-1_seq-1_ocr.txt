Vessel Was Carrying: European Emigrants to Argentina Wreckage Strew tbe Shore; Iiat no SorrlTor Is Cast up. Vigo, Spain. Dec. 11. The North Ger man Lloyd 6teamer Salier was totally lost off Cape Corrubedo. All hands were drowned. Madrid, Spain, Dec 11. A dispatch re ceived here from Villa Garcia estimates the number of victims of the Salier dis aster at 400. London, Eng., Dec. 11. A dispatch re ceived from Lloyd's agent at Coruna pays that 3S1 lives were lost by the wreck of the Salier. Berlin, Dec 11. A dispatch to the Co logne Gazette from Coruna, says: "While- it Is true that the North Ger man Lloyd steamer Sailer left Antwerp with only 210 passengers, she embarked more at various Spanish ports and the correspondent estimates the number of victims of the disaster at 400 to 500. "The Salier was commanded by Cap tain Wempe when she was lost The steamer had a general cargo. The dis aster occurred during a dense fog- and very heavy weather. The Salier had a fearful passage from Gremen to this port. Two of her boats were swept overboard by the heavy seas which beat over her and she sustained other dam ages from the same cause. It Is believ ed that about 400 persons peiished. The steamer struck during the night, lion day last, on a ledge of rocks about two and one-half miles off Cape Carrubedo on her way from this place to Villagarica where she was to ship another list of steerage passengers bound for Buenos Ayres. A large amount of wreckage is reported to have washed ashore. "The Salier had to run far enough Bouth to clear the rocks off Cape Corru bedo before starboarding her helm and heading southwest, gradually pointing up westward and then in a northwester ly direction In order to lied into the bay leading up to "Villagarcia. But Captain Wempe seems to have been thrown out of his reckoning by the fog and rain and to have headed to port loo soon, with Hie result that he failed to clear tne rocks below Cape Corrubeda and went .down with his ship and all hands. SEARCHING THE SHORE The whole coast in the vicinity of the cene of the wreck is being searched for survivors of the Salier and all hope has not been given up of picking up someone who may be able to give details of the terrible calamity. The agents of the North German Lloyd company here have been instructed from Bremen to epare no expense in searching for the missing passengers and crew of the sunken steamer. It is known that the Salier had a pilot on board when she struck. The weather, however, which the steamer experienced is described as being in the nature of a hurricane. Of the steerage passengers there were over 100 Russians, about thirty-five Gall clans, some Germans and about 200 Spaniards, according to the estimates, all on their way to the Argentine Repub lic, looking for new homes for them selves and families. If the disaster had occurred after the Salier touched at Vll lagarcia the loss of life would have been much greater, as it is understood that there were nearly 100 more passengers, men, women and children, waiting at that port to embark on board the Salier for Buenos Ayres. OLD, BUT SEAWORTHY. The Salier was an old vessel which the North German Lloyd company had agreed to sell to an Italian firm trading between Italy and American ports, but owing to some slight disagreement as to the terms the deal was not completed and the steamer was sent on another voyage. She was considered to be in every way seaworthy and the only rea son the North German Lloyd company had for selling the Salier was that there were more modern boats of the same line in readiness to take her place. Her last trip across the Atlantic was made in September last, when she left Baltimore for Bremen arriving there safely on Sept 23. The Salier was 3,000 tons gross reg ister, was 351 feet long, brig-rigged and had a single propeller. Captain Wempe had commanded the Salier for a number of yeazs. STORY QUICKLY TOLD. Coruna, Dec 11. Owing to the fact that there seems to be no survivors of the wreck, there is little to fall back on ti account for the disaster. Experts here look upon the loss of the Salier as having possibly beendue to her having' crashed upon the rocks in a fog, as was the case of the British steamer Drum mond Castle, which was lost in June last oft the northwestern extremity of France, with 230 people. Another theory of the cause of the disaster is that the Salier's steering gear may have been cerried away while she was heading around the rocks for Vil lagarcia, and she thus became unman ageable and was driven upon the reef, which is about two and a half miles from land. The passengers of the Salier, it is con jectured, must all, or nearly all have been in their berths in-the steerage at the time the steamer struck, and it is thought that the great majority- of them were drowned before they could tumble out on -deck, for no bodies with life-preservers have been found, so far as known at present. SALIER'S OFFICERS. Baltimore, lid., Dec 11. The North German Lloyd steamer Salier, wrecked on the night of Dec 7, off tbe Spanish coast, left this port Sept. 9 last, for Bre men.

Havana, Dec. 11. Captain General Weyler arrived once more in this city at 5 o'clock this evening, on horseback, ac companied by Lieutenant Colonel Escri bano and others of his staff and by a cavalry escort The streets of Havana were thronged with people and the houses of the town had been gaily decorated with bunting in anticipation of the captain general's return. The Plaza Armes In front of the cap tain general's palace was packed with a vast concourse of people. The Marquis Ahumada, vice governor general, accompanied by the colonel of his staff, met Captain General Weyler at the entrance of the palace. Immediately after entering the palace Captain Genera! Weyler appeared on the balcony bowing- his acknowledgements to the vivas which the multitude in the space were shouting- for Spain, Spanish Cuba, the king, the queen, the army, the navy and the volunteers. Captain General Weyler made a brief address, in the course of which he said: "I have only directed. The army has done all." Various delegations, both civil and military, were received later by General Weyler at the palace and they offered their congratulations upon the outcome of his operations in Pinar del Rio. Cap tain General Weyler responded that the credit for the combination which had re sulted in the fall of the Cuban chief was ail due to the Marquis Ahumada, but the latter said he had only seconded his chief's plans.

The details are not known, ttut an unusual flurry at the palace today gives currency to the belief that the insur gents gained the day.

Many other arrests were reported in Havana today but no names can be ascertained. NOT DONE RATIFYING YET Spanish People Cheer Their Qaeen as If She had Killed Maceo Herself. Madrid, Spain, Dec. 11. There is no abatement in the manifestations of joy at the death of Antonio Maceo. The queen regent received an ovation at -the opera last nighty Her majesty sent an aide-de-camp to congrattlate the wife of Major Cirujeda, theofficer who comman ded the Spanish troops in the engage ment with the insurgents near Punta Brava, during which the Cuban leader met his death, and Frederico Gomez, the son of Maximo Gomez, committea suicide, rather than abandon the body of his chief. It is stated that the United States con sul at Valencia has announced that tne Laurada is near that port. The Epoca, the official journal, in re peating this statement, says that the man-of-war Marie Therese is ready to start for Valencia. (There is no United States consul ac credited to Valencia in Spain.) KINDRED SPIRIT RECOGNIZED Socialist Leader in the Italian Dopotlea Praises Maceo. Rome, Dec. 11. Signor Imbriani. the Socialist leader, in the chamber of depu ties today, referring to the death of An tonio Maceo, said that the house must feel in duty bound to do homage to Ma ceo, who died bravely fighting for the independence of his country. The senti ments expressed by the speaker were warmly cheered by the Leftists. Signor Imbriana added that to rebel was the duty of the oppressed, and was glory to him who laid down his life for his country's liberty. There has been some comment here over the fact that Signor Imbriana was not called to order, and that no notice was taken of the cheers from the public galleries over his eulogy of Antonio Maceo. It is understood that the presi dent offered no remonstrance, fearing: that the result of his interference might be an angry discussion. DEATH STILL DISCREDITED Cohans tar, for Ono Thing, ThatfYcrtncha Was Not Maceo's Physician. Key West, Fia., Dec 11. Maceo's death is still discredited by the greater number of prominent Cubans here. Yet there are a number who fear It is true. All await the arrival of the steamship from Havana tomorrow, before conced ing it to be true. The Spanish consul received official news of Maceo's death yesterday The report that Dr. Zertucha. who was Maceo's physician, had seen Maceo's body examined, is untrue. It is learned from a reliable source that Zertucha was never Maceo's physician. Some gentle men here believe that Maceo had form ed a plan with Gomez to go to the Hava na district to meet Gomez's forces there, as Gomez had sent 7,000 men to the Ha vana distr.ct Maceo crossed the trocha with 600 men through Cayajubos. In a skirmish with the forces of Gen oral Arotas, after he had crossed the trocha, Maceo's forces wounded twelve of the Spanish troops. It is reported that Maceo left Rios Rivera, his second in command, who landed from the United States on Sep tember 1, in charrge of the insurgent forces In Pinar del Rio. Rlos Rivera de feated the Spanish in the last war in the province of Jovellarud. 3IAYBE rrs A CUBAN- TRICK Insurgents Slight Hnve Rigged npa Corpse Jast to Fool Weyler. Havana. Dec 11. Dr. Zerrtucha, the personal physician of Antonio Macs), wno, afaer surrendering to Colonel Tort at San Felipe, furnished the confirmation of the reported death of the great Cuban leader, has given to the press in an inter view at Melena Iel Sur, additional facts in connection v.kh the case. It seems that Maceo and his companions did not cros thi trocha or military line jf Pinur del Rio in the sense generally wdcr ctooc. They passed from Pinar del Rio into Havana province by the sa in an open boat, five trips being required to take the T.'hole party of Insurgents from Pinar del Rio to near Banes, this prov ince, and as the boat would only hold ; i ; eisht men in addition to its handlers, it will be seen that Maceo's party was com posed of forty men only. The iigat was dark and stormy. Maceo was ac companied by Miro, another important insurgent leader, and others of his staff. They landed near Banes and shortly V afterwards occupied the same ground with the Spanish troops under Major, Cirujeda, resulting- as alleged, in tbe death of the Cuban chief. The meeting between the Spaniards ' and insurgents was seemingly of an ac cidental natture, the former having no. idea at that time 'that Maceo had' suc ceeded in leaving the province of Pinar del Rio. In "spite of the official accounts of the death of Maceo and Francisco Gomez,, there are many here who refuse to credit the report. Friends of the insurgents express their belief that either the jew elry and other things alleged to have ben found by the Spanish soldiers did not belong to Maceo or else they were placed upon the body as a rase in order to throw dust in the eyes of the Span iards while Maceo pushed on eastward and communicated with Maximo Go mer. Dr. Zertucha also states that Major Cirujeda narrowly escaped a severe de feat and possibly capture at the hands of the insurgents. He also says that the insurgents in the vicinity of Melena1 have deserted the Cuban cause and have sur rendered to the Spanish authorities, as they are worn out with the many fa tigues they have endured and the priva tions suffered during the long- and wea risome campaign. The doctor adds that Bermudez, one of the most important of the surviving! Insurgent leaders, was wounded fatally In the abdomen on De cember 3, in an engagement fought in ihe heights of Gobernadora with the Spanish troops under General Ynclan. Dispatches from the latter confirm it. It is officially stated here today that "Miro, the insurgent leader who accom panied Maceo out of Pinar del Rio, was also wounded by the side of the great Cuban soldier, and that Alberto Modarse, Alfredo Justir, Roman Ahmude, and Gor con. all staff officers of Maceo, were wounded in the fight during which their leader fell. Dr. Zertucha, who has been Riven his liberty, has asked permission to leave Cuba for Spain and there is lit tle doubt that his request will be grant ed. Business on the bourse here has been suspended in order that the members may indulge in the manifestations of joy at the death of Antonio Maceo. A dispatch from Matanzas, says that Ihe local guerrillas there have killed an insurgent leader. Major Juan Pablo Toro. Advices from Palma, province of Santa Clara, are that the local guerilla force there has killed another noted insurgent leader, Nestor Palma.

Havana, Dec. 11. El DIaro del Maria in commenting on President 'Cleveland's message says, in "part: "The president, If he is sincere in his expressions as to his impartial conduct towards Spain, should have expelled that Cuban filibustering agents from. Ameri can territory long since." The paper also disputes President 'Cleveland's assertion that the insurgents hold two-thirds of the island. It says that the United States should attend to the solution of its own International af fairs and leave Spain to settle hers. The United States warship Newark ar rived her this morning. Nothing can be learned of her errand or whither she Is bound. 

SULTAN ROARS ABOUT IT Threatens to Sever Diplomatic Relations on Account of tbe Message. New York, Dec. 11. A special from Washington to the World says: Presi dent Cleveland has been called to ac count by the sultan of Turkey. An em phatic protest was made yesterday by the Turkish government against the lan guag2 used in the president's message to congress respecting the massacres of the Armenians and the general conduct of the government towards the Christians in the empire. Thes ituation is said to threaten th- rupture of the diplomatic re lations between the United States and Turkey. Mustapha Bey, the Turkish minister. It ist rumored at the state department, has intimated that if some amends are not made by the president he will be oblig ed to ask for his papers and will return to Constantinople. The deep displeasure of the sult,an was made known to Secretary Olney on Thursday by Mustapha Bey in accord ance with a cablegram received by him on Wednesday from his nome govern ment The interview between the minister and secretary of state is described as ex cedeinglj interesting and somewhat ex citing. Mustapha Bey began by stating that his government had Instructed him to make an emphatic protest "against the hars hand unjust language used by the president in his public utterance con cerning a power with which the United States sustained friendly diplomatic re lations." Thi3 was accusing President Cleve land of a diplomatic discourtesy, but the minister made it still more serious by stafing that the sultan regarded Presi dent Cleveland's message as tne argu ment of an advocate, in that he pre sented enly one side of the case, although he pfS.-essed complete information re garding the other, or Turkish, side, which had been -officially communicated t him. The minister also called attention to various grievances that his government entertains against citizens of the United States. He said that they had libelled the sultan and abused the Turkish gov ernment and had bssn allowed to do fo unreprimanded by the president, al though some of them were public offic ers. Complaint was also made against th American missionaries in Turkey, who were charged with inciting the Armen ians against the Turkish government and with aiding them by assisting in or concealing dynamite fo. bombs In Chris tan churches. It is said that Mustapha Bey presented what the Turksh government regards as proof of the charges made and that they are now on file in the department Among those accused are Dr. Hamlin, the well-known Congregational minister, and Drs. Wright and Washburn, of Roberts college In Constantinople. Wants to Know Who Will It el p. London.

Darling and developed the fact that she was the wife of a Confederate general, a fact not brought out in the original debate on the measure. The result was that a point of no quorum wa3 made on his motion to lay the bill on the table and It went over until next Friday. WAR CLAIMS IX THE HOUSE Wherein, Amonz Other Things, the Value of Confederate Money is Involved. Washington, D. C, Dec 1L The house yesterday passed a bill to prohibit the sale of liquor in the capitol and today at the opening of the session. Rev. Cowden, the blind chaplain, referred In his invo cation to that fact. "We thank thee, oh Lord," said he, "that the house is no longer responsible for the liquor traffic in the halls of the national capitol. - Grant, we pray Thee, that the bill passed yesterday, will go through the regular channels and speedl ly become a law, never again to be re pealed in the history of our nation."

Bills were passed to pay Peter Cook of Arkansas 5S05 for stores and supplies taken by federal troops during the war; to pay Augustus P. Burdltt 55,130 for the use of the steamboat Mattle during the war; to refer the claim of William P. Buckmaster or the construction of the steamer Oswego to the court of claims.

Lynch 52.490 for services as assistant quartermaster in Cincinnati. 1861-2, and to refer the claim of Major James Stewart, United States army, re tired, for longevity pay, to the court of claims. GROSVENOR CALLED DOWN. In the course of the debate on the lat ter bill Mr. Grosvenor (Rep. O.) bitterly denounced the government's treatment of its just creditors. "If all the busi ness men. of this country," he said, adopted the dishonest principles of the government In dealing with their credi tors the income of the government would not suffice to fill the penitenti aries with them." Mr. Cannon, chairman of the appro priations committee, resented Mr. Gros venor's remarks. He denied that the statute of limitations was a fraud only voted by those who did not desire to do justice. Major Stewart, the beneficiary of the bill, he said, was on the retired list of the army, drawing annually 52, 600, and it was sought to override the statute of limitations In his favor. Why should he be made a special beneficiary when hundreds of volunteer soldiers, se curing a mere pittance from the govern ment werc-barred by the statute of lim itations. He declared that this govern ment was swift to do justice and insist ed that the government In plealing the statute of limitation only held to a line of action always Insisted upon betw-en individuals. When the committee rose and the bllH were adopted the Cook and Burditt bills were passed. IN CONFEDERATE MONEY. Mr. Daisell Rep. Pa.,) then made a sensational attack on the bill to pay Flora A. Darling 5,-553 in full satisfac tion of all claims for her arrest and Im prisonment and the seizure of her prop erty at New Orleans in 1SS4. He point ed out a fact not brought out during the debate in the committee, that Mrs. Darl ing was the wife of a Confederate gen eral, and In sympathy with the south ern cause. Th property for which this bill sought to reimburse her had. he aid, consisted of Tennessee and Louisiana bank noea which were assumed to be worth their par value in gold. Mr. Boatner (Dem. La..) and Mr Rlch ardn (Dem, Tenn.) both declared that some of the bank notes of their states were worth par In gold throughout the war. Mr. Cor fDem. Tena.,) however, declared that In 1&53 there was no Ten ntisee or Louisiana bank not which would bring ovr 30 cents on the dollar.
