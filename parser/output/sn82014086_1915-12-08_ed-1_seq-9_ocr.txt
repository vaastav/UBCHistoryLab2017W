'NORWICH BULLETIN, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1915 Submits a Definite Plan for Action in Movement for National Preparedness FOR NATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND SECURITY Would Supplement Present Force of Regular Army With Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiery Tells Solons That if Full Navy Program is Carried Out We Will Have a Fleet for Defense That Will be "Fitted to Our Needs - and Worthy of Our Traditions" Asserts That Country's Merchant Marine Should be Nurtured Recommends Early Adoption of Measures to Give Full Justice to the Philippines and Porto Rico Declares Na tion's Secret Foes Should be Crushed; National Resourc es Conserved and Regulations Formulated to Meet the Railroad Problem 

FOLLOWING is the message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and house at tbe beginning of tbe Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress Since 1 last had , the privilege of addressing you on the state of tbe Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea, which bad then only begun to disclose Its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within Its flame some portion of every quarter of the (lobe, not excepting our own heml sphere, has altered tbe whole face of International affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. - We have stood apart, studiously neu trnL It was our manifest duty to do u. Not only did we have no part or Interest in the policies which seem to :ve brought the conflict on; It was (i:-iessary. If a universal catastrophe ::s to be avoided, that a limit should or set to the sweep of destructive war lir.l that some part of the great fam of nations should keep the process 's of peace alive, if only to prevent -.'.octive eeoiicmic ruin and the break f-iy.-ri throughout the world of the In .(isti'tea by which its populations are eil nd sustulncd. It was manifestly duty of tb? self governed nations .,' iti's ceniispht-re to redress, if possi the balance of 'rconomie loss and ' muslon In tha other, if they could nothing more. In the day of read ;::rcie2t aiiJ recuperation we earnest i" tope and believe that they can be r infinite service. In this neutrality, to which thev were bidden not cuiy by their scp urate life and their habitual detach raent from the polities of Europe, but also by n clear perception of interna tlonal duty, the states of America have become conscious of a now and mort vital community of iiitercst and mora) partnership in affairs, mere denrlj conscious of the many common syinpa thies and Interests and duties which bid them etand together. There was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the re publics fighting their way to independ ence in Central and South America when the government of the United States looked upon itself as in some sort the guardian of the republics to the south of her as against any en croach ments or efforts at political con trol from the other side of the water: felt it its duty to play the part even without Invitation from them, and 1 think that we can claim that the task was undertaken with a true and disin terested enthusiasm for the freedom of the Americas and the unmolested self government of ber independent peoples. But It was always difficult to maintain such a role without offense to the pride of the peoples whose free dom of action we mengi-x to protect and - without prorolring serious mis conceptions of iur motives, and every thoughtful mau of affairs must wel come tl altered circumstances of the Bw dfl7 !n whose light we now stand. when there is no claim of guardian whip cr toooght of wards, but instead full am tenornblo association as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors In the interest, of all Amer ica, north and south. Our concern for the independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America la not altered. We reta'n nr.a bated the spirit that has inspired us throughout tfe whole lifts o? onr government and which wa so frankly put into words bp President Monroe. Ws still mean Always to make a common cause of national ;ndeperdeo.- and of political lit erf y la America. But that purpose fit aow better r.nderstood so far as it eB!rns ourselves. It Is known not to a selfish purpose. It Is known to have In it 1:0 thought of taking advan tage of soy government in this hemi sphere or pbjtlag its political fortunes for our own benefit All the govern ment? of America stand, so far as we are concerned, upon a footing of genu ine equality and unquestioned Inde pendence. Ws have been put to the test In the case of Mexico, and we have srol the Teat Whether wo have benefited Mex !ca by the course we hae pursued re snarno to le seen. Ber fortunes are in bar D hands. Bnt we have at leat pre4 that we will not take advan tage of her In her distress and under; 

'SINIT take to Impost; upon tier an order am! government of our own choosing. Lib erty la often a fierce and Intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set ai:d to which no hounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tlon to the high doctrine of the Vlr ginla bill of rights, which in the great days In which our government was se; up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine Is. "That government is or ongh to be Instituted for the common beue fit, protection and security of the pen pie, nation or community:" that ""of all the various modes and forms ot government that Is the best which l capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness aud safety and ! most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and tlia when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community hath an indubitable. Inalienable and Indefeasible right to reform, alter 01 abolish It in such manner as shall be Judged most conducive ro the pnhli weal." We have nnhesltatlngly ap piled that heroic principle to the casi of Mexico and now hopefully awai the rebirth of the troubled republic which had so much of which to pttrjr itself find so little sympathy from ar. lutsfde quiirtpr In the radical but tier ss:iry prof-ess We will aid and be friend Mexico, hut wc will not coercr her. ami our course with regard to he. ought to be sufil'Meiit pro:;f t all Amer lea that wc sock no political suzerainty or selfish control. PAN-AMERICAMSM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Economic Adjustments Inevitable With in the Next Generation. The morai is that the states of Amur lea are not hor.tile rivals, but co-op erating friends, and that their grow iug sense of community of interest alike In matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them n new significance as factors in interna tionul aff:-.irs jy d In the political his tory of the world. Zt presents them av in a very deep and true sense a uiii in world affairs, spiritual partners standing together because thinking to gether. quick with common sympathies and common Ideals. Separated, thej are subject to all the cross currents ot the confused politics of a world of bos tile rivalries; united in spirit and pur pose, they cannot be disappointed o: their peaceful destiny. This Is pan-Americanism. It has nom of the spirit of empire in it. It is th embodiment, the effectual embodiment of the spirit of law end lndependenrs and liberty and mutual service. A very notable body of men recentlj met in the city of Washington, at the Invitation and as the guests of this government, whose deliberations are likely to i?e looked back to as marking a memarble turning point la the his tory 'A America. They were repre sentative spokesmen of the several In dependent states of this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the financial and commercial relations of the republics of the two continents which nature and political fortune have s Intimately linked together. I earnestly recommend to your perusal ths reports of their proceedings and of the actions of their committees. Tou will get from them, I think, a fresh conception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which Americans of both continents may draw together In practical co-operation and of what the material foundations of this hope ful partnership of interest must con slst of how we chould bnlld them and of how necessary It Is that we should hasten their building. There 13, 1 venture to point out, an especial significance just now attach ing to this whole matter of drawing the Americas together in bonds of hon orable partnership and mutual advan tage because of the economic readjust ments which the world must inevitably witness within tbe next generation, when peace shall have at last resumed its healthful tasks. In the perform ance of these tasks I believe the Amer leas to be destined to play their parts together. I am interested to fix your attention on this prospect now because unless you take it within your view . IAL and permit the luil significance of it to command your thought I cannot find the right light in which to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very front of my whole thought as I address yu today. 1 mean national defense. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we arc appointed to speak can fail to per ceive that their passion Is for peace, their genius best displayed in the prac tlce of the arts of peace. Great democ racies are not belligerent They do not seek or desire war. Their thought Is of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and tbe uo censored thought that quickens it Conquest and dominion are not In our reckoning or agreeable to our princi ples. But just because we demand un molested development and the undis turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, wo resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national development to the Inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel It wher ever there io a people that tries to walk In these difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed it as important that our neigh bors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be: have set America aside as a whole for the nses of independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all onr policies. We regard war merely as 0 means of asserting the rights of a peo pie against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta torial power v.-ithln our own nation as of aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary In times of peace as in times of war and we shall always see to It that our military peace establishment is no larger than is actually and continuous ly needed for the uses of days in which no enemies move against us. But we do believe in a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of the gi.e-srnments which they have set up to serve them In our constitutions Oemselvcs wc have commanded that "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed," and our confidence has been that our safety In times of danger would lie lit the rising of the nation to take care of itself, as tbe farmers rose at Lexington. SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and immediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it The military arm of their government, which they will not allow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their independence secure, and not their own Independence merely, but the lights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened am bition to play. It is with these ideals in mind that t&e plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from Its present strength of 5,023 offi cers and 102.0S5 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,136 officers and 1S4.707 enlisted men. or 141,843 all told, all services, rank and file, by tbe addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of field artillery and four aero squadrons, besides 760 officers re Quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the all Important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently 'speak, 702 non commissioned officers for service In drill, recruiting and tbe like and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance department and other similar auxiliary services. These are the additions necessary to render the army adequate for its present du ties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, bnt also in the Philippines. In the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isth mus and in Porto Rico. By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplates supplementing tbe army by a force of 400.000 disciplined citi zens, raised in increments of 133.000 a year" throughout a period of three: years. This it Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough" period of tiyee years. This force of 400.000 men Would be pro vided with personal accouterments as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assem bled for training at stated intervals at convenient places in association with suitable units of the regular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. It would depend upon the patriotic feeling of the younger men of the country whether they responded to such a call to service or not It would depend upon the patriotic spirit of the employers of the country wbeth er they made It possible for the young er men in their employ to respond un der favorable conditions or not I for one do not doubt the patriotic devotion either of our young men or of those who give them employment those for whose benefit and protection ihey would in fact enlist I would look forward to the success of such ca ex periment with entire confidence. At least so much by way of prepara tion for defense seems to me to be ab solutely Imperative now. We cannot do less. 

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR GREATER NAVY. Always Looked to It as Our First and Chief Line of Defense. The program which will be laid be fore you by the secretary of the navy Is similarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out but It does make definite and ex plicit a program which has heretofore been only implicit, held In the minds of the committees od naval affairs and disclosed In the debates of the two houses, but nowhere formulated or for mally adopted. It seems to me very clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plau for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency aud to press that plan to completion within the next five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense; we have always seen it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high in deed among tbe navies of the maritime nations. We should now definitely de termine how we shall complete what we have begun and how soon. The program to be laid before you contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gun boats and one hospital ship: the second year two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat and one fuel oil ship; the third year two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines and fifteen coast subma rines: the fourth year two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and the fifth year two battleships, one bat tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, oneern m'Tnlflon ship and one repair ship. The secretary of the navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors. 2,500 apprentice seamen and 1.500 ma rines. Ills increase would be suffi cient to care for the ships which are to be completed within the fiscal year 1917 and also for the number of men which must be put in training to man the ships which will be completed early in 1918. It Is also necessary that the number of midshipmen at the Na val academy at Annapolis should be increased by at least 300 in order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added to. and authority is ask ed to appoint, for engineering dutiej only, approved graduates of engineer ing colleges, and for service in the avi ation corps a certain number of men taken from civil life. COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE FINE MERCHANT MARINE. United States Should Be Its Own Car rier on the Seas. If this full program should be carried out we should have built o.r building in 1921, according to the estimates of sur vival and standards of classification followed by the general board of the department, an effective navy consist ing of 27 battleships of the first line. 0 battle cruisers. 25 battleships of the second line. 10 armored cruisers. 13 scout cruisers, G first class cruisers. 3 second class cruisers, 10 third class cruisers, 108 destroyers. 18 fleet sub marines, 157 coast submarines, 6 mon itors, 20 gunboats. 4 supply ships, 15 fuel ships. 4 transports, 3 tenders to torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special types and two ammunition ships. This would be a navy fitted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. But armies and Instruments of war are only part of what has to be con sidered If we are to consider the su preme matter of national self sufficien cy and security in all its aspects. There are other great matters which will be thrust upon our attention whether w will or not There is, for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping Involved tn this great problem of national adequacy It Is necessary for many weighty rea sons of national efficiency and devel opment that we should have a great merchant marine. The great merchant Beet we once used to make us rich, that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag into every sea. and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and Indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It Is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed onr commercial Independence on the seas. For it is a question of independence. If other nations go to war or seek to hamper each other's commerce our merchants. It seems, are at (heir mer cy to do with as they please. We must use their ships and use them as they determine. We have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handle our own commerce on the seas. Our inde pendence is provincial, and Is only on land and within our own borders. We are not likely to be permitted to use even tbe ships of other nations tn ri valry of their own trade and are with out means to extend our commerce even where tbe doors are wide open and our goods desired. Such a situa tion is not to be endured. It Is of capi tal importance not only that the Unit ed JUates should be its own carrier on the seas and enjoy the economic inde pendence which only an adequate merchant marine would give it but also that the American hemisphere a a whole should enjoy a like Independ ence and serf sufficiency, if It is not to be drawn into the tangle of Euro pean affairs. Without such independ ence the whole question of our polite leal unity and self determination is very seriously clouded and complicated Indeed. Moreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ship of our own not ships of war. but ships of peace, carrying goods and car rying much more: creatlug friendships and rendering indispensable services to all interests on this side the water. They must move constantly back and forth between the Americas. They are the only shuttles that can weave the delicate fabric of sympathy, compre hension. confidence and mutual de pendeuce In which we wish to clothe our policy of America for Americans. The task of building up an adequate merchant marine for America private capital must ultimately undertake and achieve, as it has undertaken and achieved every othpr H'ce task among us in the past, with admirable enter prise. Intelligence and vigor, and it seems to me a manifest dictate of wis dom that we should promptly remove every legal obstacle that may stand lu the way of this much to be desired re vival of onr old Independence and should facilitate in every possible way the building, purchase and American registration of ships. But capital ean not accomplish this great task of a sudden. It must embark npon It by degrees, as the opportunities of trade develop. Something must be done at once, done to open routes and develop opportunities where they are as yet undeveloped, done to open tbe arteries of trade where the currents have not yet learned to run. especially between the two American continents, where they are. singularly enough, yet to be created and quickened, and It is evi dent that only the government can un dertake such beginnings and assume the initial financial risks. When the risk has passed and private capital be gins to find Its way In sufficient abun dance into these new channels the gov ernment may withdraw. But it can not omit to begin. It should take the first steps, and should take them at once. Our goods must not lie piled up at our ports and stored upon side tracks in freight cars which are dally needed on the roads, must not be left without means of transport to any for eign quarter. We must not await the permission of foreign shipowners and foreign governments to send them whore we wilL With a view to meeting these press ing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselves at the earliest possi ble moment of tbe present unparalleled opportunity of Unking the two Ameri cas together in bonds of mutual inter est and service, an opportnnlty which may never return again if we miss it now. proposals will be made to the present congress for the purchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by the government similar to those made to the last congress, but modified In some essential particulars. I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt acceptance with the more confidence because every month that has elapsed since tbe former pro posals Were made has made tbe ne cessity for such action more and more manifestly Imperative. That need was then foreseen. It Is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting, but who can find no conveyance for their goods. 1 am not so much Interested in tbe par ticulars of the program as I am In taking Immediate advantage of tbe great opportunity which awaits us if we will but act In this- emergency. In this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should prevail, and out of it should come an early solu tion of this pressing problem. 

SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINES. Recommends Early Adoption of Meas ure Giving Them Fuller Justice. There is another matter which seems to me to be very Intimately associated with the question of natioual safety and preparation for defense. That is our policy toward tbe Philippines and the people of Porto Rico. Our treat ment of tbem and their attitude to ward us are manifestly of the first con sequence In the development of our duties in the world and in getting a free hand to perform those duties. We j must be free from every unnecessary j burden or embarrassment, and there la. no better way to be clear of em-j barrassment than to fulfill our prom ise and promote the interest of tboe dependent on us to the utmost- Bills for the aiteratlou and reform of the government of ths Philippines and for rendering fuller political justice to the people of Porto Rico were submitted to the Sixty-third congress. They will be submitted also to you. I ueed not particularize their details. . You are most of you already familiar with them. But I do recommend tbem to your early adoption with tbe sincere conviction that there are few measures you could adopt which would mora servieeably clear the way for tbe great policies by which we wish to make good, now and always, our right to lead In enterprises of peace and good will and economic and political freedom. Tbe plans for the armed forces of the nation which 1 have outlined and for the general policy of adequate prep aration for mobilizatiou and defense involve, of course, very large addition al expenditures of money, expenditures which will considerably exceed the es timated revenues of the government It Is made my doty by law whenever tbe estimates of expenditure exceed the estimates of revenue to cull tbe attention of the congress to tbe fact and suggest any means of meeting tbe deficiency that It may be wise or pos sible for me to suggest I am ready to believe that It would be my duty to do so in any case, and 1 feel particu larly bound to speak of the matter when it appears that the deficiency will arise directly out of the adoption by the congress of treasures which I my self urge it to adopt Allow me there fore to 8 peak briefly of the present state of the treasury and of the fiscal problems which tbe next year will probably disclose. On tbe 30tb of June last there was an available balance In tbe general fund of the treasury of $104.17.105.7S. The total estimated receipts for the year 1910, on tbe assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed by the last congress will not be extended beyond its present limit the 31st of December. 1915. and that the present duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after the 1st of May. 191G. will le $rt70.3G5.5(X. The bnlauce of June last aud these estimated rev enues come therefore to a grand total of $774.535.n05.7S. The total estimated disbursements for the present fiscal year. Including twenty-five millions for tbe r.mama canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency appropriations and $50,000 for miscellaneous debt redenii tions. will be $753..s:l.oOO. and the bal ance In the general fuud of the treas ury will be reduced to $20,044,005.78. The emergency revenue net If coiitla ned beyond Us present time limitation would produce during the half year then remaining about forty-one mil lions. The duty of 1 cent ier pound on sugar If continued would produce during the two months of the fiscal year remaining after the 1st of May abont fifteen millions. These two sums, amounting together to fifty-six roil Hons. If added to the revenues of the second half of the fiscal year would yield the treasury nt the end of the year an available balance of $70,044. 005.7a The additional revenues required to carry out the program of military and naval preparation of which I have spoken would, as nt present estimated, be for the fiscal year 1017 

S'.K.SOO.OOO Those figures, taken with the figures for thi present fiscal year which I I have already given, disclose our finan cial problem for the year 1917. As suming that the taxes imposed by the emergency revenue act and the pres ent duty on sugar are to be discontin ued and that the balance at the close of the present fiscal year will be only $20,044,005.78, that the disbursements for the Panama canal will again be about $25,000,000 and that tbe addl- ; tlonal expenditures for the army and navy are authorized by tho congress, j the deficit in the general fund of the j treasury on the 30th of June, 1917. will be nearly $235,003,000. To this sum at least $50,000,000 should be add ed to represent a safe working balance for the treasury and $12,000,000 to in clude the usual deficiency estimates in 1917. and these additions would make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If tbe present taxes should be continued throughout this year and the next however, there would be u balance in the treasury of some $70,500,000 at the end of the present fiscal year and a deficit at tho end of the next year 01 only some $50,000,000, or, reckoning in $02,000,000 for deficiency appropria tions and a safe treasury balance at tbe end of the year, a total deficit ot some $112,000,000. The obvious -moral of the figures is that it Is a pialn coun sel of prudence to continue all of the present taxes or their equivalents and confine ourselves to the problem of providing $112,000,000 of new revenue rather than $297,000,000. How shall we obtain the new rev enue? We are frequently reminded that there are many millions of bonds which the treasury is authorized under existing law to sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current revenues for the construction of the Panama canal, and It is true that bonds for the amount of approximately $222.00) are now available for that purpose. Prior to 1913 $134,631,980 of these bonds had actually benn sold to recoup the ex- pendltures at the isthmus, and now i constitute a considerable item of the ! public debt. But I for one do not be- i lieve that .the people of thta country I approve of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrowing money is Fhortsight ed finance. It can be Justified only when permanent things are to be ac complished which many generations will certainly benefit by and which it seems hardly fair that a single genera tion should pay for. The objects we are now proponing to spend money for cannot be so classified, except in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to be done In the Interest of posterity as well o in our own. It seems to me a clear dictate of pru dent statesmanship and frank finance that In what we are now. I hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the country are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation tbey are to carry and to know from the outset now. The new hills should be paid by internal taxation. .To what .ouTcc. then, shall we turn? This is so peculiarly a question which the gentlemen of the house of representatives are expected under tbe constitution to propose an answer to that you will hardly expect me to do more than discuss it lu very general terms. We should be following an al most . universal example ' of modern governments If we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the Income taxes. By somewhat lowering the pres ent limits of exemption and the figure at which the surtax shall begin to be Imposed and by increasing, step by step, throughout the present graduation the surtax Itself, the income taxes as at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient to balance the books of the treasury at the end of the fiscal year 1917 without anywhere making the burden unreasonably or oppressively heavy. The precise reckonings are fully and accurately set out in the re port of the secretary of the treasury which will be immediately laid before vou. And. there are many additional sources "of revenue which "can Justly be resorted to without hampering the in dustries of the country or putting any too great charge upon individual ex penditure. A tajt of one centner gallon on gasoline ai.d nrphtha would yield, at the present estimated production. $10,000,000, a tax of r c-nts per horse power on automobties and Internal ex plosion engines $13,000,000, a stamp tax on bank checks probably $1S.Q00. 000, a tax of 25 retiTT per ton on pig Iron $10,000,896. a tax of 25 cents per tOll Oil f.i: .
