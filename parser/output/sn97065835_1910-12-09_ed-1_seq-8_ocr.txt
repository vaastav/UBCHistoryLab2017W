Revenues and Payne Tariff Art. The Payne tarifi t)ill is commend ed as the best income producing measure ever enacted. The corpora tion tax has worked well and the tax has been easily collected. Of criti cism of the bill he says: "The schedules of the rates oi duty in the Payne tariff act have been subjected to a great dcai of criticism, some of it just, more of it unlounded, and too much misrep-j rOCAtllnf All TV.a 1„ resentation. pursuance of The act WHS adopted in declaration by party for the protection of home in-]about dustr.es the measure of the protec-, t0 be the Terence between the cost of producing it at home, togeth er with such addition to thnt. differ ence as might give a reasonable pro fit to the home producer. The basis for the criticism of this tariff is that in respect to a number of the sched ules the declared measure was not lollowed, but a higher difference re tained or inserted by way of undue discrimination in facor of certain industries and manufactures. Little, if any, of the criticism of the tariif has been directed against the pro tective principle above stated but the main body of the^ criticism has been based on the charge that the at- tempt to conform to the measure of! protection was not honestly and sin cerely adhered to." In discussing the feature of a "Tariff Board" provided by the law, he says "1 cannot too much em phasize the Importance and benefit of tho plan above proposed for tieat ment of the tariff. It facilitates the removal of noteworthy defects ii: an important law, without a disturb ance of business prosperity." No recommendations are made as to any further tariff legislation in the near future. Hanking and Currency liefoini.

Department of Justice. He recommends prosecution under the federal "bucket shop" laws to prevent use of the mails by fraudu lent schemes. He says: "The work ing! of the anti-trust law present perhaps the most important, litiga tion before the department, and the number of cases filed shows the ac tivity of the government in enforc ing that statute." He renews recommendation of en actment of a general law providing for national incorporation of indus trial and other companies engaged in interstate commerce Of needed re forms in the judicial projodure, lie says: "One great crying need in the United States is cheapening the cost of litigation by simplifying judicial procedure and expediting tinal judg ment.

"No man ought to have, as a mat ter of right, a review of his case by the Supreme Court. He should be satisfied by one hearing before a court of first instance and one review by a court of appeals. The proper and chief usefulness of the Supreme Court, and especially of the Supreme Court of the United States, is, in the cases which come before it, so to .. .expound the law, and especially the inferior courts in future litigation and for the executive officers in the construction of statutes and the per formance of their legal duties. Therefore, any provisions for review of cases by the Supreme Court that cast upon that Court the duty of passing on questions of evidence and the construction of particular forms of instruments, like idictments, ot wills, or contracts, decisions not of general application' or tice 110w in C°ngreSS CS~ a commission as early as the 8pecial SIS Con­|public making recommendations for these places of a responsibility that must in. irksome and can create nothing but trouble and it would result in securing from postmasters greater atiention to business, greater fidelity ami consequently greater economj and efficiency in the postoffices which they conduct."

Postofflce Department. Attention is called to the initial establishment of a number of postal banks on Jan. 1. 1911. Note is made of decrease in the deficiency of the postoffice department and the efforts being made to wipe it out entirely. Further extension of classified civil service postmasters is recommended as follows: "Upon the recommendation of the Postmaster General, I have included in the classified service all assistant postmasters, and I believe that this giving of a secure tenure to those who are the most important subordi nates of postmasters will add much to the efficiency of their offices and an economical administration. A large number of the fourth-class post masters are now in the classified ser vice. 1 think it would be wise to put in the classified service the first, sec ond and third-class postmasters." "To make this change would take the postmasters out of politics wdulo relieve congressmen who now are burdened with the necessity of of the "franking privilege" i* condemned and restrictions recom­ He yet holds that the post­ rates on magazines should be raised. He endorses the "parcels post"' pro position in the tollowing language. ••With respect to the parry's posr I respectfully ,,atpnts Constitution' tuinish precedents for t.be' clsive value to land claimants importance, merely clog the burden of the court and render more difficult Its higher function, which make it so important a part of the framework of our gov ernment. The supreme court is now carrying an unnecessary burden of appeals of this kind, and I earnestly urge that it be removed."

A general parcels post will involve .a much greater outlay. The same argument is made against the parcels post that was against the postal savings hank that it is introducing the government, into a business which ought to be conducted by private persons, and is paternalism. The Post-Office De partment has a great plant and a great organization, reaching into the most remote hamlet of the Unit ed States, and with this machinery it is able to do a great many things economically that if a new organ ization were necessary it would be impossible to do without extravagant expenditure. That is the reason why the postal savings bank can be carried on at a small additional cost, and why it is possible to incorpor ate at a very inconsiderable expense a parcels post in the rural delivery system." made Navy Department. He endorses the present plan of building two new battleships a year, and a few needed auxiliary vessels. Interior Department. matter of considerable concern to western states is the proposed law to permit of appeals to courts from the Interior department, land claimants. This is en dorsed in the following paragraph: "The secretary of the Interior rec commends a change of the law in respect to the procedure in adjudi cating claims for lands, by which ap apeal can be taken from the decis ions of the Department of the Court of Appeals of the District of Colum bia for a judicial consideration of the rights of the claimant. This change finds complete analogy in the present provision for appeals from the decisions of the Commissioner The judgments of the court in such cases would be of de- gen- erally and to the Department of the disordered, I Interior in the administration of the Kidney Pills. law, would enable claimants to.symptom of kidney trouble.' bring into Court tlie final consider ation of issues as to the title to Government land and would I' a box. think, obviate a good deal of the, subsequent litigation that now arises in our Western courts. The bill is pending, I believe, in the House, having been favorably report ed from the Committee on Public Lands, and I recommend its enact ment." Conservation of Natural Resources. After referring to his St. Paul ad dress on conservation to save repe tition of a large amount of detailed discussion, he makes specific recom mendations First. That the limitations now imposed upon the Executive which forbids him reserving more Forest Lands in Oregon, Washington, Ida ho, Montana, Colorado and Wyo ming, he removed. Second. That the coal deposits of the Government be leased after advertisement inviting competitive bids, for terms not exceeding fifty years, with readjustment every ten or twelve years. Third. That phosphate lands be handled similarly to coal lands. Fourth. That the laws should al low a prospector for oil or gas to have the right to prospect for two years, and that such lands should be leased v^Jien productive. Fifth. That water power sites be leased on competitive bidding. Eijjht Hour Law. "Since 1868 it has been the de clared purpose of this Government to favor the movement for an eight hour day by a provision of law that none of the employes employed by or on behalf of the Government should work longer than eight hours in every twenty-four. This law has been construed to limit the ap plication of the requirement to those who are directly employed by the Government or to those who are em ployed upon public works situate up on lands owned by the United States. This construction prevented its application to government battle ships and other vessels built in pri vate shipyards and to heavy guns and armor plate contracted for and made at private establishments. I recommend that instead of en acting the proposed bill, the mean ing of which is not clear and definite and might be given a construction embarrassing to the public interest, the present act be enlarged by pro viding that public works shall be construed to include not only build- ings and work upon public ground, but also ships, armor and large -uns when manufactured in private! yards of factories." Workmen's Compensation. "In view of the keen, widespread interest now felt in the United States in a system of compensation for industrial accidents to supplant our present thoroughly unsatisfac tory system of employers' liability (a subject the importance of •which Congress has already recoginzed by the appointment of a commission) I recommend that the Internationa] Congress on Industrial Insurance be invited to hold its meeting in 1913 in Washington, and that an priation of $1 0,000 be made to cov er the necessary expenses of organ izing and carrying en the meeting." Safety Appliances and Provisions. "The protection of railroad em ployees from personal injury is a subject of the highest importance and demands continuing attention. There have been two measures pend ing in Congress, one for the super vision of boilers and the other for the enlargement of dangerous clear ances. Certainly some measures ought to be adopted looking to a prevention of accidents from these causes." Valuation of Railroads. "The Interstate Commerce Com mission has recommended appropria tions for the purpose of enabling it to enter upon a valuation of all railroads. This has always been within the jurisdiction of the Com mission, but the requisite funds have been wanting. Statistics of the val ue of each railroad to issue stocks and bonds, as I hope we may."
