The Inteligencer sees but one qualitv in Mac that would suit its party, t „ wit'; it says he is a ‘first rate gambler. If the charge should prove true, he will draw largely on the Democratic vote of the District. The secret of our neighbor's dislike to Mr. Mclndoe is that he is a strong supporter of the Government, and took a prominent part in suppressing the Ozaukee draft riots, and “bringing the rioters to Camp. A Hoax. —Considerable excitement prevails in Chicago from the apporance in the Times of a statement of a Mr. J. Wesley Green, that lie had been the bearer of overtures of Peace between Jeff.

The Sutler makes an occasional viaist to the Regiment, but neglects to bring a supply of letter paper, and by o late order ped Hers arc prohibited to come within the lines, consequently writing let ters is about “played out.” It is now live months since we were paid and from present appearances we will see the end of the sixth before the advent of the Paymaster, beeesh shinplast. rs have passed very well among the residents of Virginia, until they discovered tliot we were passing the fac simile. The Officers depend wholly on the Brigade commissary for provisions, and he, good soul, is delight ed to book the amount and await the / counting of the dispenses of green-backs. The bill of fare is not so extensive as it might be yet through the oxer;ions of head officers, we have had full rations giv out since our arrival in our present ('.imp, un i relish a good dish of beans, and boil ed pork and “Hard took,” as you would a slice of Sponge cake. During the past week the boys have been busy prepaiing for the cold blasts of winter. Small, but comfortable log houses are in progress of erection, and various are means resorted to for comfort’s sake. The Shelter Tents are little better than nothing during a rain storm, let alone the misery one undergoes, in sleep ing in them during these cold nights. Your correspondent is an occupant of u neat little eight by ten log hut. and enjoys him self amazingly. We have a fire-place* built of sod, mud and sticks of wood. Though the outer appearance of our residence is not very prepossessing, yet on the inside all is comfort, and so man aged that one (a soldier) cannot help but enjoy himself and feel perfectly at home. In one corner is a table, on which 3-011 find the tin ware, an 1 what remains of the diuner just eaten, and then in lieu of chairs wc have three logged stools, and in another corner Is our bed rolled up in oil cloth. We h ; ve a mantle piece on which 3'ou will find 1 cop\' of the “Orpheus C Kerr Papers, ’ a Novel, - The How” or Domestic Homanee in real life, The Pi ble, and divers little trinkets, necessary in making up a soldiers pack. Wc enjoy ourselves and an contented, and we oh’ n gather in circle-; and chat over o and times, discuss polities, the army, and abilities of Geneials, Are. w inding up with a declara tion ct what we will do and accomplish when we reach home. \\ o are not over desirous fr a move, and are not dispose I to rush Burnsy or tret because a few Seeesh Cavalry make sudden and unexpected dashes on some of our sleepy cavalry. Such accidents are expeete I to happen, and we must console ourselves with the thought that the fools are not all dead 3-et, but many more squads are to be caught by the the ever prowling Seceshers. The Generals and the ruling power my plan battles and study the s.d eace of strategy, and we vil] do light ing, but we solemnly pro U-t against rush lug us into the mire without knowing a rub* by which we are to be extricated. We look upon Burnside as ca| able, and we hope he may prove an abler and greater Gen ral than his predecessor, but in this we have our misgivings We loved Mc- Clellan. and as vet we have no reason lor changing our opinions of the man. and honestly believe him to be the man and that time will give him full credit an I hi just dues. Such we believe him entitled to. Kcports are in circulation that Secosh have evacuated I - redericksburg, and that the right of our army is in motion. How true, can t sav. Ihe President's message came into camp this morning, and down went axes, guns and accoutrements and all rallied in groapes to hear it. It i 3 a document, admit to 1 to be. marked by unmistakable ability and by an earnest sine.-re patriot ism. As a matter of course there are those dissenting from the view - 1 in tiie message, vet are vailing to nekn. vl odge, the truthfulness of the closing par agraph*. and accord to“the I’resideut an honesty of purpose. By late orders from Gen'l Burnside, the issue of passes to and from Washington. without the permission of Grand Division Generals *r from him are prohibited. This has caused quite a flutter among the red tape I gentlemen, who were counting on a visit to the capital during our delay. Several applied, and all received their applications "returned disapproved.’’ Red tape subsided and remain their commands. Brig. (Jen' 1 Meredith, formerly Colonel of the 19th Indiana, is now commanding this Brigade, Gen'l Gibbons having been transferred to the command of Picket's old division. John MoCormic of your city is now acting Quartermaster of the 2nd Regiment. Lieut. Haggles being acting Brigade Quartermaster, h'urgeon Ward of the the 2nd is Brigade Surgeon, and Dr. Arndt acting Regimental Surgeon. The return of paroled prisoners are daily looked for, and hoped for, as the papers soy they are all exchanged, and wo don t feel inclined to dispute such au thority at this stage of the game. It has been hinted that the 30th Re<'L would likely form a part of this Brigade. We hope so, and will assure them a hearty welcome, and convince them that they come among a fighting crew, with a man at the helm capable of marching on straight roads, and camping within gun shot of chickens, pigs, sheep, and all other things necessary for a soldier. Come boys, and we will be prepared to receive you with outstretched arms. J need not mention the general good conduct of Cos. “J," for all are of one mind and desirous of doing us they wish to bu done by, comfortably situated, with a plen ty of rations, the desired point in the ar my. We have occasional issue of Rico Molasses and desecated potatoes. At this time we arc growing fat, and as I have said before vearo as happy as Kings. in conclusion, allow the “Deacon’’ and “Scotch” to accept my best wishes, and that the “Deacon will make his “mark,” and when Soldiering has about “played out,” he will resort to the types fur conso lation The drums beat for parade, a batch of orders aro to be read, perhaps of some pour follow who has been arraigned before a general Court Martial, and undoubtedly dismissed the service. Boor boy, he de serves the pity, but should recollect that he is dealing with military, not the civil authorities. The lucky fellow will be happy. 

“JUDGE.” D S.—An order has just been recieved to be in readiness to march, and we infer that our destination is Fredericksburg -1 wo regimentsof our Division are ordered to Aquia Caeek, while the 24th Michigan of this Brigade, guards the Railroad. By this move we judge that Burnside has just thought of tiie remaining part of the Mc- Clellan plans, and is about carrying them out.

M. j Everything last night was bustle and activity, as today was the time fixed for crossing the rivcV During the night, the pontoons were conveyed to the river, and the artillery of 143 pieces placed in posi tion opposite the citv. At 5 o clock this morning the rebels fir ed two signal guns, and during the latter part of the night rockets were seen with in their lines. At 5 o clock the construction of three bridges in front of the city were commen ced. U hen the bridges were about half com pleted, the enemy opened a murderous fire of in! an try from the houses on the oppo site bank. I p to tiiis time not a shot had been fired on our side, Ihe engineers wre driven from the bridges and several killed and wounded. At six o’clock Gen. Burnside ordered all the guns to he oponed on the citv. The cannonading which has continued up to the present time is terrible. The citv is -•a fire, an 1 Its destruction appears inevi table. 1 he enemy about < o clock tin's morning opened with their heavy guns from their works, but so far have done no serious in jury. ] ben. !• ranklin constructed his bridges about three miles ! clow the citv, meeting with but slight opposition.

TRIP TO OREGON. An Abridgement cf the Junior * Memoran da oj a Trip Across the Plains. On the oth Isaac Winn had an attack of the Mountain Fever, which lasted three days (very sick some of the time) —when he recov ered. On the Bth Joseph Strude was taken sick with the lever. The mosquitoes have been very bad during our stay on Green river No. 1. Wednesday, July 9—Well we got started about 9 and drove over te Green river No. 2, taking the boat along with us. The distance is 15 miles—road rough and rockv. No. 2is not so large as No. 1 at present, but has been much larger this spring—is falling rapidly. Have splendid grass to-night. Frank San ford is down with the Fever, also Captain Stootsman. Jo. Stude is quite sick. There are several in the other trains down with the •Fever—some very bad cases. Billy Brown has a very severe cold. dhttTsday, July] 10, was spout in ferrying Green river No. 2. Frank is a little better. We ferried No. 2 some ways* above the old ford. Friday. July 11.—Drove over a very rough rocky road to tho 3d and last fork of Greenriv er—3 miles distant. It is smaller than either of the other forks. We crossed it this after noon by ferrying it with our wagon boxes. It was not a very bad stream to cross, although quiteswift and from 4 to 5 feet deep. Jo. Stud ■ has got abot well. Frank is quite sick again. Saturday, July 12. I.eft the last fork of Green river this morning. Road’ mixed— good and bad, hard and soft. H„d to cross four young livers, two of whi'li were very bad. Camped on a fine stream at the foot of a long Cany an. Drove about 15 miles* Dick Symons of DodgevilleJ has been quite feeble for some time, but now is getting bet ter. Mosquitoes and Buffalo Gnats, awful, in fact I never saw the infernal insects as bad as they are to-night. Murrish is sick with the fever. Sunday, July 13. —Entered the Banyan this morning. For a little ways the road was good. A fair sized mountain stream runs down the Canvan which’we had to cross sev eral times—very hard crossing. We had to leave the old road and take one made by the train ahead of us along the mountain side, which was sliding and rough—full of stumps. Several teams tipped over and broke down Wisconsin got through all safe. Insects aw ful, they bit our horses so ranch that we could hardly manage them. The hills on each side of the Canvan are from 800 to 1,600 fee t high, very steep, and covered with heavy forests of lull straight pines and balsam. The scenery is very beautiful and romantic. We passed fort Snyder, comprising one log bouse and situated in a very beautiful spot. Camp ed three miles beyond Fort Snyder, near the head of Canvan. Good water and fair grass. Drove al-o-it lo miles, Tins has been a very hard day on our horses—insects and bad road - Our train has become somewhat split up. Our Wisconsin wagons—twelve in number, are 4 or 5 miles ahead of the others. The rest arc scattered along ton and fifteen miles back. Monday, July 14.—Our drive this morning commenced by ascending along hill—-climb ing the mountains. No sooner had we arriv ed at the top than down we went ; and so it was Jail day—up and down. We crossed Ifve different mountains. Snow in some places, in the road sor 6 feet deep. Had a storm in the afti moon—a little rain, a heap of snow and a little hail. We have passed through very heavy, tall pine and balsam for ests. This is decided a very romantic country— great high hills, tall thi< k forests, and moun tain streams of pure cold wat> r rushing in tor ents down the hill sides. We drov .25 miles and camped in deep narrow Canyan, on a wet, swampy spot. Grass scarce. Sprague has the Fever very severe this evening. Frank is quite sick yet. Toe season here is backward. Strawberries and Goosberries just in bloom. Tuesday, July 15—Drove through a deep bad mud-hole this morning and then had to leave the old read and climb a hard, long steep hill—had to double teams. The rest of the forenoon we had good roads but hilly. Had to cross two deep streams. In the afternoon wc emerged into a splendid valley—roadsjfine. It scented like emerging from winter into spring. Nature has planted a beautiful flower garden in this valley. There are some of the prettiest roses I ever saw—wild or tame. We found some ripe strawberries, which went very gu.°d, although small. Drove 20 miles.- Sprague and Trank better. Wcdlusday , July 10—Just as wc were hitching up a messenger from the teams back came into camp and .said that two wagons which were about 8 miles back of the rest, had been attacked and robbed bv the Indians Twenty-five men from the different trains went back. The wagons belonged to two brothers, Campbell, recently from Denver, but formerly from Wiota, Wisconsin. One was loaded with provisions the other with whiskey. There were seven men with tile wagons, six of whom escaped, but J. M. Camp bell was killed, lie leaves two children in W iota—his wife being dead. II- was forty nine years old. The Campbells had between $9,000 and SIO,OOO in gold and Treasury notes, all of which wercs.olen. The history of this tragedy is about as follows: The wagons were very heavily loaded, and conse quently couM not travel as fast as the lighter ones, which accounts for t! *ir being so far behind; they had repeatedly refused to Join either train, and wj ihl camp by themselves, although generally but a short distance off. They were climbing a very hard hill and had got seperated about half a mile. They we re in heavy timber and thick under fusb. The ted devils came upon the hinder w igon un expectedly, and wore unperceived until one of them slapped one of the Campbells on the shoulder and asked for bread. While Camp bell was getting the bread, the Indian stole his revolver, and also the revolvers belonging to the others—four in all. They then took them prisoners, and commenced ransacking the wagon. They divided the gold but threw t e Treasury n->t son the ground. They mad t .-- pris-mers help pack the mules they had stolen from them with provisions and cloth ing, after which they fired the wagon. After keeping the whit - prisoners about two hours tu \ ; them at liberty and motioned them to leave. The whites started. .1. M • Camp bio stopping to pick up the Treasury notes. Aftei the prisoners had got off about one j hundred yaads, the Indians commenced firing i 0 n them, but missed all hut J M. C, Th party that went back, found his dead body, where ho fell, with four arrow wounds in the breast and one bullet hole in the forehead- Ilis body was undisturbed except that his poc kets were rifled and every thing taken except a fine gold watch, which the Indians probably overlooked, as it was in the fob pocket of his pantaloons. His faithful dog was laying by his side, and could hardly be forced from him. They hurried him by the road-side. The three men with the head wagon took three mules, and hiding in the brush, and skulking around, finally got into camp. These three mules were all that was saved. The Indians were undoubted ly.headed by a white man. The Campbell that escaped will probably be remember ed by many of the old residents ot Min eral Point, as he formerly lived there and is acquainted with many of them —his name is Uncle .John Campbell. Thursday. July IT —We started at 8, and after driving three honrs discovered a band of Indians in the road some dis tance ahead of us and coining towards us on a regular Indian lope. We could not tell bow many of them there was, but immediately corrclled our teams, and pre pared to meet them in any way they want ed. We placed our horses inside the correll and every man that was able took his fire arms and stationed himself in front of the wagons and facing the Indi ans. W e were about forty in nnmb jr, and had a couple of old mountaineers with us, who flattered and praised us a good deal for our promptitude in facing danger, and keeping so cool. They said they had seen a great many Indian fusses, but had never seen a company of men that they would so tier trust in an Indian fight than ours. They declared we could whip five hundred Indians, and told the men behind us when they came up, that if they would keep as cool as the Wiscon" sin boys, they could whip tho whole snake nation. The Indians came galloping op, and wanted to come into our camp, but when about one hundred yards from us, we commanded them to halt, and sent four men out to meet them Only seven \ teen of the red skins came up although | there were at least one hundred and fifty I not far off. Some said they wanted to trade with the wagons, others said they i were going to Salt Lake to trade with the Mormons. They professed to be friendly and thought we treated them very bad in refusing to let them come in and trade. The Chief said he had never been treat !ed so by the whites before. They were very uneasy in our presence, and indeed i they had need to be, for our boys want- I ed to lire terribly, and had the command been given I do not think one out of the seventeen would have ever returned to his wigwam. Had we been sure they were j connected with the party that killed Camp j bell, there would have been war, whether they wanted it or nut. Tho other teams came up and we drove about five miles and camped. The Indian encampment was about two miles from us, but they' troubl ed us not with their ugly presence. We posted a strong guard to night, and went to bed and slept sound and quiet. We have tip top grass to-night. Sprague is all right again. Mu. rish has got well. Friday. July 18—Travelled down the old valley a little ways and then struck into a long narrow Canyan. in most of which the road was good. The red skins followed us a little ways, and wanted to trade, but we stopped them. They accuse the Cheyonnis and Kyutes of murdering Campbell, but we do not credit it. We passed several Salt springs to-day. We camped in a very good place where the < ’anyan widened out after climbing a small hill—Grass plentiful. Drove eighteen miles. Several little showers have graced us with their refreshing presence. Saturday. July 19. Road tfiis after noon run through the Canyan and was <Xood. One of the hind train wagons broke an axltree and came into camp riding on a rail, or rather a po’e, as rails are scarce in these parts. Avery heavy hail storm passed just South of us at noon and we have had several small rain and hailstorms during the day. In the afternoon wc passed a large pond. The road past it was marshy and several of the wagons trot ‘‘stuck in the mud.” Saw an Indian camp on the other side of the pond. It was seven o’clock before we found good wat er. and then only a small spring half a mile from the road. The heavens are black to-night and every little while send us a small sprinkling of water—expect to get more before morning. Drove about twenty miles. Sunday. Judy 20. —As T expected, it gave us a wetting last night. Tile flashes and roar of Nature’s artillery were terrific. The morning was cloudy and threatening, and at noon it pitche 1 In—cold and hitter, like November's chilly sleets in Wiscon sin. Road soft. Scenery very nice and soil let tite- We have had poor weather for two days Crossed several deep streams. Drove eighteen Fftnlord has re covered. [to be continued ] Sad Accident. Our town was excited greatly last Sat urday, at the terrible news of an accident having befallen a young man residing 3 miles west of the town of Dodgeville, re sulting in the almost instantaneous death of the sufferer. The facts as far as we can ascertain from inquiry, are as fol lows ; William Cornish, a j’oung man resid ing some three miles west of Dodgeville, left his residence last Saturday, in cempa* ny with .Mr. Cornish his father, Mr. John Simpson and Mr. Dunstan, for the purpose of hunting game. Having proceeded to a settlement some five or six miles south east of the town of Ridgeway, the place designed for the hunting expedition, they parted from each other, each taking the way bethought best. Having been part' ted from each other about one quarter of an hour, Mr. Simpson heard the report of a gun coming from the direction that the above named Win. Cornish had taken.— Following it up, he found the corpse of W in. Cornish lying on his back with his gun lying over his shoulder. The shot or ball which had evidently cause 1 his death entered behind his right ear and passed through his head The body was interred in our grave yard last Monday, when a lane number ofweeping friends followed him to his last resting place. r l his young man is abou r 19 or 20 years of age and leave* a wife and one child.— Dcrfjeri >U Ch ren icle.
