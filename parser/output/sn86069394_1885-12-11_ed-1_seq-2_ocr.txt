Yeoman. :. : The Creamery at Lebanon proved evon a flatter failure than bur miser ably mis-managed concern. In a lit tle over a year it ran in debt about $3,500, which with its first . cost of $4,500, made it tax its owner to the amount of about $8,000. Last week It was sold at public auction and brought the puny sum of $1,012. One great draw-back to the enterprises paying iu this section is the tremeiid- ous cost that the projectors charged ' for the buildings and machinery. In each case it. was $4,500, wlieu an ex perienced builder tells us that $2,000 would have been a big pried. Stan ford Journal. " Wm. II. Vandcrbilt, tho Now York millionaire, fell dead at his home Tuesday afternoon, at 2:30 o'clock. Ho was sitting in conversation with Robt. Garrett, President of tho B. & O. Railroad. The two railroad magnates were discussing the now terminal facilities of the Baltimoro & Ohio, the new in let into the city it bad secured by way of Staton Island, and Mr. Van- derbilt showed a lively, interest in the results that were to follow for the island of his birth from the new en terprise. It was while the talk turn ed upon this, the scenes of his child hood and early work, contrasted with the tremendous achievements of his old age, that Mr. Garrett, sitting on a sofa and facing the millionaire, who leaned forward in his arm chair as was ins nauit wucn inorougiuy interested, the President of the Ball! more & Ohio was suddenly made awaro of a slight indistinctness in Mr. Vandcrbilt's speech that grew into an inarticulate souud. As he leaned over to catch his words, Mr. Vandcrbilt pitched for ward without a word of warning, and foil heavily on the floor on his face. Mr. Garrett sprang to his feet, with an exclamation of alarm, and seizing a pillow from the sofa laid it under his friend's head, then sum moued Mrs. Vauderbllt and George, the youngest son. Messengers were sent in haste for physicians. One from tho neighborhood responded lii'sl, and was followed almost im mediately by the family doctor, Dr James W. McLean. Such simple restoratives as were at hand had been applied, but human aid was in vain. Mr. Vandcrbilt never spoke or moved after he fell under the sud den stroke, and died within a few minutes, without a struggle. To all intents and purposes he was dead the instant he fell forward upon tho floor Had Mr, Vandcrbilt lived to May 8, next year, he would have been 65 real's of agei He was born at the Staten Island homestead on that date, in the year 1821. By arrangement ol the nearest frioiids with members of the familv, it was decidrd that the funeral should be on Friday. nex at 10 o'clock, from St. Bartholomew'? Church, at Madison avenue and For ty-fourth street, of which Rev. Dr Cook is pastor. Mr. Vandcrbilt was a vestryman in the church, to the construction of which he had contrl buted largely. Tho sexton- of the church was charged with the funeral arrangements. At Mr. Vandcrbilt's own desire, he will be interred in the family mauso leum in the Moravian Cemetery at New Dorp, L. I., which has been completed. Mr. Vandcrbilt has made a will. What its provisions are is not known to any outside ol the family and his confidential ad vlser and friend, Mr. Depew. But the Vanderbilts were a very united family. ' Mr. Depew ventured the prediction that the millionaire's death would mako no change in existing conditions,- '' "lhe Vauderbilt railroad system will be managed and owned as here toforo. The sons, will manage the estate ami propoi-iioo, all-of which are here, the same as if the master hand was still at tho helm'. He own ed no real estate as investments, Like the Commodore (his father) he had no faith in real estate, but be lieved that for iiioii in active affair it was the correct thing to invest iu properties that could be turned into money instantly if needed. The children Mr, Vauderbilt leaves aro in their regular succession as to age from Cornelius, who is about 40 yoars of age, down.! Cornelius; Wil liam K., Frederick W. and Geo. W. and four daughters Mrs. Elliott Shepard, Mrs. Wm. D. : Sloane, Mrs. Hamilton McIC. Twomblcy and Mrs. Dr. Somard Webb. Cornelius and Win. K. are both actively engaged in-the management of the family railroad interests, and will so con tinue, Cornelius is the chairman of the Board . of Directors of the New York Central and the Michigan Cen tral systems, and Wm. K. holds the Lake Shore and Nickel Plate systems. Frederick W. who is about 32 years old, is a diroctor in all the roads. - Mr. Vauderbilt was, it is thought, richer than any Blngle member of the Rothschild family. The Duke of Westminister Is' said to be worth $200,000,000, but Mr. Vanderbilt was richer,' because the Duke's money only pays him about 2 per cent, be ing mainly in lands and houses. Mr. Vauderbilt had a much larger in come. He was by far the wealthiest man in'Amorica, but like the poorest and humblest citizen he has gone the way of all flesh. John Sherman was the second choice of the Republican Senators. , Their, first choice was Gen. Logan, and he wisely declined. In capacity Mr. Sherman is fit for the position- In character he Is unfit for any public trust He is a man of ability, but he has used his ability for evil purposes, It made him one of the most useful agents in the theft of the Presidency in 1876. It has enabled him to be- . come a millionaire during the period of his public - service,- although his ' salary has not paid his expenses.' Ho is a dangerous and unscrupulous sec tional agitator,, who stands ready to fostor hatred and mistrust between the States while masquerading as a . patriot.! lie is a plausible hypocrite, whoso election) it is to be feared, may mead the revival of war animosities and ft hoipd partisan fight against the Administration. xtew lorn 'World, ..ii -,.l;Vi,AV; The President's Message. Washington, Dec. 8. The session of tho House was opened this morn ing with almost every seat tilled. The gallery was crowded, there being great curiosity to hear President Cleveland's first otllcial message. The message was a very long document. The following Is an abstract, giving his views on all important points : .- It opoii8 with a tender allusion to the recent doath of Vico President Hendricks, and a reference to his dis tinguished public services, his integ rity aud devotion to duty. A goneral survoy shows that our elations with all foreign powers continue to be friendly. There are no questions of difficulty pending with any foreign government. Au allusion is made to the appointment of Mr. Keiloy as Minister to Austria, and his rejection by that country. The reasons advanced by Austria, asking for the withdrawal of Keilcy, were such as could not be acquiesced n by the President without violating his oath of office. ' Ho has mado no now nomination, and the interests of the Government at Vienna are now u the care of tho Secretary of Lega tion. ; Concerning an Isthmian ship ontial, the President says the interest of the United Statos in a practical transit for ship across the Isthmus has been repeatedly manifested during the last half of the century, and whatev er highway may be constructed across tho carrier must bo for the world's benefit, a trust for mankind, to bo removed from the chance of domin ation by any' single power. Nor should it becoino a point for invita tion for hostilities or a prize for war like ambition. Towards such a real ization the efforts of his administra tion will be applied. The Oliiuese question iu the West om States, despite the reiitrictivc leg islation, is far from satisfactory, but all the power of the Government should bo exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of emigrants from that country. . w ,. On the fishery question the Presi dent recommends Congress to provide for a commission, in which the Gov ernment of the Uuited States aud Great Britain shall be represented, charged with the settlement of the entire question of the fishery rights of the two countries. He u rites legislation to make the recently concluded commercial treaty with Mexico effective. Of the international copyright he says action Is certainly dcsirablo to bring about the object in view. Inadequacy of legislation touching citizenship and naturalization is brought to the attention of Congress. It is important that the right oi alien domicile, as distinguished from feder al naturalization, bo defined. He urges a recast of the appropria tions for consular and diplomatic ser vice on a footing commensurate with the importance of our i,a"iional inter ests and advcs-ites a system of con st rong grounds iu favor of tho sus pensions of the coinage of silver dol lars, llio aulliorlty to coin money given to Congress by tho Constitution if it permits purchase of bullion for coinage, in any event docs not justify coinage to an extent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circu lating medium. The President sayB wo have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply- the pres ent needs of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish to them in circulation. If their coinage is suspended they can be readily obtained by' all who desire them. If the need .of more is at any time apparout, the coinage cau bo re newed. . . . i FOR 

SEVEN YEARS. r1 k& . -J: .'x,-P - The St Louis Republican, the lead ing Democratic daily of the south west, pays this handsomecompllmcnt to that class of journals which most city dailies suecringly allude to as "rural roosters:" "As a class editors of country newspapers have done more for their State and its welfare and progress than any other set of men in its borders. The country newspapers (in many respects it is unjust to speak of it as a country pa per) is a great comfort, and a great advantage to every community. The money paid for it is tho boat invested in the long line of family expenses." Wm. Courtney, a negro desperado, shot aud killed Lieut Edward B.

Lee McDormentstabbed anil killed Sheet Oles, near Oweuton, Saturday. They .wore neighbors,, ; 'i ll v sular..!::,pectiou. Iu reviewing the reports and re commendations of his Cabinet officers the Presidcul first takes up tho re port of Secretary Manning, and dis cusses the tariff and currency and coinage question. OP THE TAWFF he says : "The fact that our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of an economical administration of the Government justifies a reduction in the amount received from the people for its support Our Government is but the means, established by the will of a free people, by which cer tain principles are applied which they have adopted for their benefit and protection, and it is never better administered and its true spirit is never better observed than when the people's taxation for its support is scrupulously limited to the. actual necessity of expenditure, and distrib uted according to a just and aquita ble plau. The proposition with which we have to deal is a reduction of the revenue received by the Government and indirectly 1 paid by the people from customs duties. ' The question of free trade is not involved, nor is there now any occasion for a general discussion of the wisdom or expedi ency of a protective system. Justice and fairness dictate that in any mod ification of our present laws relating to revenue, the industries ' and interests which ' have '' been encouraged by such laws and in which our citizens have largo in vestments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed. We should al so deal with tho subject iu. such a manner as to protect the interest of American labor, which is tho captial of our worklngmcii ; its stability aud proper remuneration furnish the most justifiable pretext for a protec tive policy. Within these limitations a certain reduction should be made in our customs revenue. The amount ol such reductions having beou de termined, and inquiry follows as lo where it can be remitted, and which articles cau best be released from du ty iu the interest of our citizens. I think a reduction should be mado in the rcvonue derived from a tax upon the imported necessaries or life. We thus directly lesson the cost of living in overy family of the land and re lease to the people in every humble home alarger measure of the rewards of frugaHndustry."' ' : . , ' , THE 

CURUENCT PROBLEM.- - Nothing more 1 important, he says than tho present condition of our currency and coinage cau claim the attention of Congress. 'flic vory lim ited amount of circulating . National bank' notes, compared with the amount the law permits them to is sue, indicates that the volume of our circulating medium may be largely increased through this instrumental ity. r On tho eilfror (juosljott ho lakes . .
