r I. STOP Motherhood vs. Romance Nature's Remedy Raising Grain Or Mak ing Cannon More Executions. Bridgeport and Xorwalk are the only cities in Connecticut which have a five cent fare. The rest have 10 cent fares with transfers. A five cent fare without transfers is somewhat cheaper. The Public Utilities Commission -ways that nickel cities owe their favored condition to their shapes. Which lend them selves to the cheaper fare. The point will be worth taking into consideration when future cities are laid out. It may be easier to say than to explain. May be, in fact, a species of verbal an aesthesia intends to allay the pain of the communities which have to pay a dime. Henry F"ord, who la a hu.sincss man of reputation and accom plishment, says that the way to run a street railway to make money is to make the fares very cheap so that everybody will ride. Henry was in Bridgeport the other day giving the town the "once over." Would it be worth while to turn the Bridgeport lines over to him and inrlte him to demonstrate? J. B. Potter, manager of the Bridgeport lines, has made many improvements and is doing the beet he can, w-hich isn't always as much as the people would like. , It is not his fault those things which are missing, he is dealing with a crippled child. Connecticut street railways had bad parents years ago. They suf fer from ill treatment, and cruel ty of every species known to cussedness and finance. Comes Eugene V. Brewster, rich owner of a "movie" maga zine, with a complete outfit of "movie" morals, who says that in motherhood there is some thing which inhibits love. Dif ferent heads have different weak spots. In one man's head are things that make for hatred, in another some that make for mel ancholy and so on through all the devious ways of qualities most disagreeable. In Mr. Brew ster's head there must be some thing that demotes him from a claim to high rank among civ ilized men. What school for de fectives? What class for the im provement of morality and the distraction of shame can be es tablished for the Brewsters of our modern society? The very animals know that the affection, that the love, not designed to create motherhood. 19 worthless. In whole species when the design is accomplished, the individual ceases to exist. His use has ceased. His day Is done. Nature has her remedy for those who despise motherhood. They disappear. They leave no future From motherhood the future springs. The Krupp factory in Ger many has leased from the Lenin e government some thousand acres upon which it Will put machines, with the idea of raising grain in the most intensive style pos sible to agriculture of this period.

IiOndon, Dec. 9 (By the As sociated Press) Reports from Dublin say that there was con siderable firing in that city last night. There was no suggestion that it was of unusual intensity. The expectation that yesterday's executions in Dublin will be followed by further shootings Is expressed to day in some of the Dublin dispatches to the London newspapers. These correspondents are convinced that a chain of reprisals will continue. The Daily Mail's Dublin correspond ent quotes a Free State official as say ing that there' are at least 100 des perate men in the city who, having no care for their own lives, will fol low the behest of their leaders and endeavor to assassinate members of the government and of the Irish par liament. The correspondent remarks that the authorities still have in custody several Republican leaders who were captured under certain circum stances bringing them within the scope of the recent proclamation prescribing a summary military trial and execution for persons found to possess bombs, explosives, or fire arms. These prisoners include Tom Hales, brother of Sean Hales, the deputy shot on Thursday, WBd Michael Kilroy, Sean Rua H and Tom M-guire.

Sentence of dath has been passed upon the Railroad Labor Board, but ir appeared certain today there W1U be a stay of execution for at least a year. - Republican leaders in Congress today agreed with President Harding that the board as at present consti tuted has outlived its usefulness. But the method of its execution was a natter for divergent views. A careful survey of the situation in Congress disclosed to administra tion leaders that there is but slight hope of carryin&ut between now and March 4 more than a small part qf the far reaching recommendations made by President Harding in his message. Subsidy Fight Nears. The House, under pressure, could accomplish the major part of Presi dent Harding's program, but it would avail nothing because of the jam in the Senate. Next week the Senate becomes embroiled in the fight ovet the Harding-Lasker Ship Subsidy Bill. The result is in doubt -with a few wavering votes holding the ate of the bill. But the fighting is cer tain to be prolonged and bitter. Sen ate leaders privately expressed the opinion today that if the Senate could be whipped into passing the Ship Subsidy Bill and the ten big I supply bills in the ten working weeks that remain before March 4, they would be well satisfied. If the President's program is to be carried out, therefore, it would p larently necessitate an extra session of the new 68th Congress, with its reduced Republican majorities, im mediately after the expiration of the 6 7 th on March 4. President Harding is not in favor if an extra session next summer. He has expressed himself emphatically on this ipoint saying he believed the country was tired of Congress and was deserving of a good long rest. Nevertheless the President's mess age will be made the vehicle for a new drive for an extra session. Con ducted by Senator La Foilette, Re publican of Wisconsin, and his so called "progressive" lieutenants from the grain belt, will conduct the drive. (Continued on Page Six. 

GIRL PUPILS STRIPPED IN j CITY SCHOOLS Physical Examinations Conducted by Board am Health Physicians Cause Storm of Protest Examinations Made Without Knowledge orr Consent of Board of Education. The Board of Health, through its doctors, has been! carrying on a medical examination in the schools without J it is said, the knowledge or consent of the Board of Eduea-1 tion, in such a way that a flood of protest has descended upon the school authorities. Girls, it is said, have been examined in large nmnbera by male doctors, the girls being completely stripped to the waist, after a fashion strongly reminiscent of the ex- animations of registered men, going into the army.

The Neue Frie Presse described it as an up rising against the Macedonian policy of Premier Stamboulinsky. Advices direct from Sofia, the Bul garian capital, on Friday denied ear lier reports that a revolutionary army was marching upon the city and that the government was declaring mar tial law. The Bulgarian government claimed that the rebels were beinjf nacified. It was evident, however, that a censorship had been estab lished in Bulgaria. MINORS CAN'T GET MAIL HERE Due to the practice on the part of some minors in this city of exchang ing notes whose contents would not win the approval of their parents through the medium of the general delivery window of the Bridgeport post office. Postmaster Charles F. Greene said yesterday that the law requiring a minor to present written permission from a parent or guard ian before receiving mail in the gen eral delivery, is being strictly en forced. The purpose of the general deliv ery. Postmaster Green said, is to serve transients who are in the city for only a short time, and not ror the use of those who have permanent addresses. This department of the post office, he explained, is already overcrowded with legitimate man ana cannot afford to waste the time and space necessary for handling the let ters of those who, for reasons but easily guessed, do not wish their mail delivered to their homes. At 10 o'clock last night, the Board I of Education went into executive session and the session continued un til 11:50. Today members of the Board refused to discuss the matter and declined to say what action waa J:aken, if any. It is a fact, however, that Supt. Cortright directed the in spector; of tlio Board of Health to stop the examination of girl children as soon aa the first complaint waa brought to his attention. The discussion in the Board rooms appears to have been at times hear"5 ed. There was no disagreement, it Js snid, among the members as to the impiopriety of this method of exam, ining girl children. Method Improper. The members agreed, it is under, stood, that medical examination is wise but also were of the opinion that this typo of 'examination is re pulsive to the parents of girl children and also repulsive to the girls who have the greatest shrinking and hes itation. When asked to submit to such an ordeal. It is not claimed that there was any impropriety in tho methods em ployed by tho Board of Health doc tors in making these inspections ex. ceipt ruthless disregard otf the sensi bilities of tho girl children, and that tho work was done without consult ing tho school authorities and with-, out consulting the iparents of the chil dren. In levery case, as far as can be learned, a woman nurso was present. Women Indignant. Tt is believed that great indigna tion was expressed by the women members of the Board and it is also believed that the matter was earliest brought to the attention of the Board by Mrs. Alice Smith, who lives in the Black Rock district' where the greatest amount af indignation has appeared. Members of the Board of Educa tion absolutely refuse to discuss the question today especially with respect to any immediate action which waa taken by the Board. Lynn W. Wil son said, "If this matter came up and it was the subject of action, that ac tion would be directed to the Board of Health and it would be discourteous for me to make the information pub lic before it has been received by them." Payors Women Doctors." He continued, "My personal be lief is that medical inspection proper ly carried out is uf great value. The reports of military examinations prove this claim but the examina tion of girl children has always been a sensitive . point in school systems, and if it is to take place should be accomplished by women doctors in the presence of women nurses with the knowledge of parents and under con ditions that afforded the highest amount of protection. Modesty of children ought not to be invaded un necessarily. If anything of the kind has occurred in the Bridgeport sys tem, I am sure that it will never oc cur again."
