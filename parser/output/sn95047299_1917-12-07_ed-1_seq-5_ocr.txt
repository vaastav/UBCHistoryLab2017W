St. Augustine, Fla. now here to remain for a short visit with his parents and to minister to their relief. Dr. and Mrs. McLean and small daughter, from New Haven, Conn., ar rn-ed Monday "Cubano. history will keep an imperishable memory." British and French news papers comment in about the same spirit. The London Daily News says: "It is the voice of a statesman whose and are domiciled at : vision comprehends the world." Here are the salient points in the News of the death of Herbert Lonsdale came as a shock to the community. Mr. Lonsdale spent sev eral weeks here at Lake View, and b' his genial kindness and courtesy won the warm liking of everyone he met. He left here the week before Thanks giving, planning to reach home to spend the holidav with his young wife and baby, in Providence. R. I. On the home voyage he was stricken Wind, and ill, and passed away last Tuesday, less than a week after leav ing here, having reached his home the day before. Another one from the ast thin ning ranks of the brave old veterans of the "sixties." has answered the last roll cU and been mustered out. to join his comrades in the er"it be yond. Dr. G. V. Clark, a Fedenl 'pterin, who for a number of vears has lived ar his lakeside how on Orandin Lake, has been in feeb'e health for a ve?'. and for the nat Message Our present and immediate task is to win the war, and nothing shall turn us aside until it is accomplished. Those who desire to bring about peace before that purpose is achieved, I counsel to carry their advice else where. As a nation we are united in spirit and intention. I par little heed to those who tell me otherwise. This intolerable thing this menace of combined intrigue and tber industrially or politically. We only desire to see that their affairs are left in their own hands. The people of Germany are being told by men whom they now permit to deceive them and act as their mas-) ters that they are fighting for the j very life and existence of their em-1 plre. Nothing could be more gross-1 ly or wantonly false. ' The worst that can happen to the j German people is that, after the war j is over, if they continue to live u.1; der ambitious and intriguing mas-: ters men whom other peoples of tht world could not trust, it might be im-: possible to admit them to the part- j nership of nations. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples. It might be impossible, also to admit ' Germany to free economic intercourse , of real peace. The very deep wrongs committed ', in this war will have to be righted. But they cannot be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germar.v and hei allies. The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people in the dark, and the poison has been ad ministered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote is truth. I' cannot be administered too plainly ; or too often. We are seeking permanent, net tem-; porary foundations for the peace of the world, and must seek them can-' didly and fearlessly. As always, the I right will prove to be the expedient. I ! Austria-Huneary is for the present i not her own mistress, but simply the v asset of the German government.
