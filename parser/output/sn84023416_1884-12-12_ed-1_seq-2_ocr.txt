Ulzt County raid, i loANa POND, DECEMBER 12, 1S8-4. The basis of popular government is freedom of the ballot. The mad partisans who ostracise and perse cute their political adversaries do their full share toward denying tliat right. Violence of expression dur ing a political campaign can be for gotten, Vut when it is continued for xrcets after an election has becu held and certain men or bodies of men are singled ont for denuncia tion as if they liad Lecn guilty of some grave offence, it is high time to enquire if there is any basis for dions tyranny thus sought to be established ? The Baltimore Sun has tSw foi lowing; Senator Edmunds is report cd to be somewhat indignant at the criticism passed upon his alleged in activity in the late campaign, more eepecially as it is said he contends that he has given a full equivalent to his party for all the rewards re ceived from it. His present term of service in the Senate expires March, 837, at which time he will have senred for a continuous period of more than twenty rears. An inti mate personal friend of his says Mr Edmnndc, in his recent expressions, shows that lie seriously contemplates iSecTining to be a candidate for re c.cction; mat uc ib moved to tbis determination in some degree by Ms resentment at the criticisms al luded to, but perhaps as much by Siis own delicate health and that of liis wife and daughter. Mr. Clark, the clerk of the House f Representatives, has compiled ihe list of names of members elect tft the forty-ninth congress.. The present congress consists of 201 (Democrats and 124 Republicans. The next will consist of 184 Demo 'crats and 141 Republicans.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. It is the theory of our govern ment t"hat the president shall call the attention of congress at each Session to the more important sub jects of legislation that are likely to oaie before it, but of late years it has Leen the custom, and wisely we think, to address the message as di rectly to the people as to congress. It is a message people, irrespective of parties, should read with the greatest care, as it discusses nearly every question that closely affects our national prosperity, and a close readiug of it will give the voter a clearer view of the great state ques tions than can be obtained in any other way. The last message of the president is a clear and plain presentation of many questions of great interest and importance, which he treats in that direct and forcible manner that has characterized all Jiis state papers. The portions of the message most nearly and direct ly affecting the people, are those touching tho coinage of silver dol lars, which he recommends to be appended; the reduction of the sur plus in the treasury, civil-service re form, and the state of affairs in XTt&lt As to the coinage of silver dollars 4& direct statements made embody the whole argument on that subject. The aet that the treasury is overburdened with these coins, lhat they do not c'ircula.tg freely ;among the people, and that of two ijnetallio legal tenders th cheaper Will always drive out the more vai-j ab!e from circulation, are conclus ive as to the 'inference the president tbaws ;and jthfl recommendations bas ted thereof, jfjj studying his con clusions as to tbe tariff it must be borne in mind that the president is ilie protective tariff gystjam that has iieeo or many years the jcliey of iiie -g'Wfcuuei!t( .and tli.ene is, in Hr this, .sftaojal significance j his declaratloH that -"our system of a revemifi in xwui r( a nvaaant. needs of the goycrnrajent." How .this is to be obviated the president 4ocg not say directly, but ho no"iirf, ut lour methods by whieh our for- wg' imae can oe mcrcinea ana out . !.. 4 M 1 -l ...!il. uinjjuocu VV L 1 Lli' xut in aiKy makiner such a ro- (Auctioj? in ,th tariff as shall hazard our industrial enterprises or reduce the, standard of wages to the level of that in some other countries. Tho stand taken by the president upon the question of reform, in our civil service must prove acceptable to those of all parties in this coun try who pl ice a high value upon the principles involved. The treatment of the Utah question is short and vigorous. In its efforts to stamp out polygamy from that Territory he advues congress to be limited on ly by the restraints of the constitu tion in radical legislation for the suppression of that abominable prac tice. What the president savs unon the subject of our seacoait defences will 6trike the reader a timely and important. Almost the only point in the message with which we should take issue with the president is his recommendation regarding the re moval of internal-revenue taxes from tobacco, cigars, and verythig else except spirituous liquors. We be Iveve that taxes, if imposed at all, should be placed upon the luxuries and not the necessities of life. The tax upon tobacco is 'a burden to no one, for a man who can afford to use it at all can afford to pay the small tax such use involves, or he can discontinue it. The message is, however, an admirable one, and full of common sense that the pcojie will appreciate. OUK 

WASIIIXGTOV LETTER. Regular Correspondence of tho IIekald.J It is not expected that anything of national importance will be done in Congress until after tho holiday adjournment. In the meantime the Committees will be at work, and on the re-assembling Monday, Jan. I they will all be ready to report an make short work of the appropria tion and other bills that demand at tention. There is an evident dispo sition on the part of Democrats to do very little in tho way of fore shadowing their policy until after the inauguration of President Clevc land. The party has been so long out of power and acting in the minority that it does not readily come to the front as the majority party. When the new Congress shall assemble next December, President Cleveland will have developed his policy, and Ins party will be ready to take defin ite position for the future, The Republicans will not inter pose any factious opposition to Mr Cleveland's appointments, and wil the country s good. It is not thought here that there will be any laoieat changes attempted either in the policies of the government or conduct of its affairs until after the party has the reins of government well in hand. Every effort will be made to court the favor of the peo pie and prevent any violent changes until there is a feeling of perfect safety and quietude, and changes of every character will be made so gradually that they will not be no ticed until the awakening hour shal come. Every effort is to be made to cou- i"11 Democratic control in the Northern States that went Demo cratic in November, and to try and add to that number two years from now in the hope that by that time the control of the Senate may pass into Democratic hands. In the mean time, Dakota with her half-million people asking, and justly entitled to be admitted as two States, Arizona with her 200,000 people, and Wash ington, population sufficient to form a State, will be kept out in the cold m fi . i . . as Aerniones, so that their votes may not be counted in 1888. Texas will apply to be divided in to three States, and a strong effort made to accomplish the division, but if antagonized with the propo sition of the admission of the Ter ntories as stated, nothing will be done, for it is in the Democratic mind to keep these Republican Ter ritories in their present condition to prevent their votes being cast for the Republican nominees iu 1888 Th is is the outlook now ; what Ivepubhcans will do, and what they will submit to, is in the future. It is pleasant to know that there is to day a hopeful feeling pervading the party, and do disposition to be cast down or dismayed. In fact Demo crats are surprised to find that the grand old party is just as united, just as firm and inflexible jn its de mands for the right, as it has been in all its history in the past. It has not marched to the rear, has not surrendered or luid down its arm,' but takes its temporary repulse as a .njef,e incident in its career, feeling tli at ilia time and occasion will soon arise wh it will go forth to victo ry. Democratic njembers of Congress ana already having a taste of some iof the unpleasant things which go with politiea, siwftpss, in the flood of appikMtaua tex vojSwc, Thou- pands of demands for places aie coming in from every seotion from people who writrt as though they confidently expected a reply by re turn mail to " come on." The most amusing feature of theso applica tions is that they almost invariably call for. positions with little work and big pay, the applicants being poor in ljealth, with great demands upon their purses. Contrary to the opinion that generally prevails atuonj the unknowing ones, a gov ernment clerkship in Washington is an undesirable position. No young man who is earning or can earn an honest living at home or away from Washington should give it up to come here and take a clerkship. Ask your Senator, Representative, or any one else who knows, if your correspondent is not exactly right with respect to this matter. President Arthur's recommenda tion in his last message that General Grant be given a life pension, was not the outgrowth of sentiment, but was brought about by a presenta tion to him of the necessities of the old General 's condition. It seems that tho managers of the fund that was presented to General Grant sev eral years ago made a bad invest ment of it, and that it really amounts to nothing now. The payment of interest on the fund was guaranteed by several gentlemen for stated number of years, but the guarantee time has nearly expired, aud what was thought to be ample provision for the wants of the old hero as long as he should live, has vanished like his other means and left him sub stantially without anything on which to depend. General Logan will put the President's recommendations in the matter mentioned in tho way of being carried out so far as the Sen ate is concerned. c. u. Washington, D. C, Dec. 5, 1884.
