Talk about boys going on hunting trips, but there never was a boy that had such sport ahead of him as that before Kermit Roose velt, who will accompany his strenuous father, 'President Roosevelt, on his famous year's hunt in the wilds of Africa. Kermit has the sporting blood, of his distinguished father in his veins and he will play no empty role in the big hunt. The boy is a crack shot and has been practicing with heavy rifles and pistols for several months to be in shooting shape when he meets big game. Kermit is also the official photographer of the African trip and carries with him several thousands dollars worth of camera supplies. There is going to be something doing in darkest Africa next year. , Red Cedar Shingles s

In his last message to Congress President Roosevelt fired a broadside of 21,000 words at everything and. everybody and took a gen oral crack at the universe. In the whole bunch "mollycoddle" failed to appear once. The Socialist party cast only about one half the number of votes for their Presidential tbey had expected. The Hearst and Prohibition parties were likewise disap pointed in the size of their respective votes, and the latter showed up much weaker than four years ago. The fact is that there is no room for third parties in this country. In 1SS0 the value of the Smith's agricult ural products was $2,250,000,000, and this year it promises to run very considerably ahead of these figures.

This is nearly one half as much as the total for the eutire country in 18S0, when the value of manufactured prod ucts was $5,300,000,000. Temporarily halted by the financial aud industrial depression of the last seven or eight months, now fortunately rapidly passing away, the manufacturing inter ests of the South are in better shape for great development and a more rapid growth than ever before. fiio?ffigcifrift ri t5Uo pjj 7i
