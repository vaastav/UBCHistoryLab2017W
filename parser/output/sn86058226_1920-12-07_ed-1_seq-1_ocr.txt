COORDINATION NEEDED IN ALASKAN POLICIES DECLARES GOVERNOR (By Associated Press' WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 An appeal for greater co-ordination in the poli cies of the federal government and for "the greatest possible need of self government" runs through a long se ries of recommendations for govern ing the territory of Alaska submitted in the annual report of Thomas Riggs, Jr., the territorial governor, made pub lic today. "Sentimentalists have done and are doing more damage to Alaska," Gov ernor Riggs declares,, "than can ever be undone unless a broad policy of de- velopment is undertaken which recog nizes the rights of Invested capital and the welfare of iue individual. Laws should govern instead of revocable regulations, but where there must be regulations, such regulations should be promulgated by 'authority located within the territory and not 4,000 miles away. In the interest of good citizen ship, to promate self-reliance and to strengthen the desire for public wel fare, the greatest possible need of self government should be allowed the res idents of the territory. wants 1-oni.y ucTinca. The Alaska governor urges the defi nition of some sort of a colonial policy as applied to the territory, asserting that absence of such a policy has caused capital, supposedly headed for Alaska, to turn to British Columbia to the gain of the Canadian province and to the loss of Alaska. This causes him to remark that "In Canada the founder of a great new industry sets knighted; in Alaska very often in dicted.

The Westinghouse bid was on a 5,000 k. nu steam turbine, accessories and electrical apparatus; surface con densor including double pumps throughout; and a switchboard with complete generator panel and nece sary apparatus for controlling a new 75 k. w. exciter. The contract price calls for delivery and erection in the city plant on foun dations built by the city or other con tractor. Delivery will be made in from six to eight months. The action ef the board of works in allowing the bid for the turbine and condensor sep arate from the foundation work, js in accord with the recommendation of the city council made at its meeting Monday night. Lyons Makes Estimate. The foundation, piping and wiring will cost between $25,000 and $30.C0ft, according to J. D. Lyon, consulting engineer of the city, who advised the board of works on the various bids submitted. An appropriation of $175,000 has been made by the council to take care of the purchase of the unit and the construction will come within , this amount. . , , The Skeldon Engineering company and the General Electric .company were the only ones to bid on the en tire installation of the plant, founda tions, wiring, turbine and condenser. The Westinghouse bid was $13,692 less than the Skeldon bid on the same equipment. The Allis-Chalmers bid was also higher by $8,407 on the same equipment . Detailed Investigation. A detailed investigation of the local plant and the various bids submitted has been made by Mr. Lyons and his assisants. According to Mr. Reller, city at torney, one of the things that has great bearing on the final awarding of the bid was the idea of unit respon sibility. When a bid is let to one firm for a condenser and another for a tur bine, if the two do not work well to gether, the turbine people blame th condenser and the condenser the tur bine, Mr. Reller declared. Ten per cent of the contract prico for the new electrical apparatus will be held up by the city until the com pany has complied with all the terms of the agrement. Advertise First of Year. Bids for the erection of the founda tion will not be advertised until after the first of the year. The specifica tions for piping, wiring and foundation will be drawn up by Mr. Lyons and his assistant Mr. Coughlin. Installation of all the new machin ery for the plant will be under the supervLsion of Mr. Lyons and his as sistants. The board of works, mayor, city at torney, superintendent of the city light plant, and consulting engineer met. in the board of works, room at 9 &.t m Tuesday morning in, secret session to consider the bids. AH bids were gone over in detail and. the various ; advantages of each were pointed out. After ; considerable de bate the representatives from the firms were called in and the announce ment made that the Westinghouse people had been granted the job. Ends Long Debate. The Westinghouse bid calls for a 5,000 k. w. turbine, accessories and electrical apparatus tor $95,000. A turface condensor, including double pumps throughout, $46,124. Switch board with complete generator panel and necessary apparatus for controll ing new 75 k. w. exciter, $2,584. Total $143,708. The action of the city board of works ends a debate which has been carried on by officials of the city for the past five months with consider able heat. Debates over appropria tions occupied the greater part of the fumraer sessions. After the making of the $175,000 appropriation bids were advertised for and opened Tues day. Monday' session of the worka board, in which the city council, citizens committee, and Interested citizens participated, was the scene of considerable confusion when charges of collusion were -advanced by repre sentatives, of one of the companies bidding on the proposed work. This was finally ended by the man making the charges leaving the city, it is said, and the city council nrged the board of works to accept one of the. bids if they met the estimates and specifications.
