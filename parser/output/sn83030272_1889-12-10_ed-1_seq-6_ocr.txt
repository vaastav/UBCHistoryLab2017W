Mr. Itoann Q. t : MrtiU Is there, the Arkansas BnEoxcausaii " j is there, and Mr. MoMrx.Mii of Tennessee Is ! there. These gentlemen are refinforced by that able, consistent, and sincere advocate of lowor duties, ex-Speaker Cahlisle. The loadlngr spirit of the last committee, and, after Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Mills, j the most conspicuous representative of the disastrous free-trade movement of 1883, Is not upon tho new commlttoo; ho Is not In the Fifty-first Congress. The Hon. Sill Boott will neither look af tor oorporato In terests In the present House nor champion the cause of the American workman. Mr. Eoswkll P. Floweb fills his place on Ways sad Means, and wo congratulate tho Democ racy on the chance. The Republican part of the committee In cludes Mr. MoKiklex as Chairman and Mr. Subbowb, both of whom were on tho last committee; and In addition two very ablo and experlonced legislators, Mr. Dingley of Malno and Mr. Baykb of Pennsylvania. Tho notable thing about the composition of the new committee Is the disappearance from among Its members of tho venerable Judgo Ksllst, Mr. Heed has transferred blm to tho Committee on Manufactures. Thero Is plenty of brain power in the Commlttoo on Ways and Means as made up by Speaker Beeo. On tho Republican side there are men who, while llrm in their loy alty to tho genorol prlnclplo of protection, are capablo of meeting reasonable and dis interested Democrats half way on tho nub ' Jeot of genulno tariff reform. The fato of tariff legislation in tho Fifty first Congress depends largely upon tho dis position of the Democratic mombers of tho commlttoo. Will they work for tho truo Interests of their party and of the country, or will thoy strlvo merely to assert thom I selves and thus prolong tho consequonoes of the colossal mistake of two years ago ? j Tho Bevlval of Centralization. , Tho eagerness of Republicans In both branohes of Congress to bring forward meas ures for Federal supervision or control of elections ,1s encouraging to Democrats, but It seems a little queer. It must be known : even to tho most radical Federallzors that there cxistsjamong consorvatlvo. Republicans a feeling either of positive hostility toward such measures or of doubt as to their effect. Moreover, tho d'dcusslon of them must bo ; purely academic, for In tho face of united and j i determined Domocratio opposition in the i Eouso, any drastlo legislation of tho sort pro- ,; posed is an impossibility. Yot such a bril- llant and rising young politician as Henry Cabot Lodge Is credited with aspiring to distinction, and even to leadership, on tho strength of this hopeless Issue. I But from the vague indications of the I President's message, and from tho tenor of I eomo of the legislation already proposed, it j la evident that tho plan for directing Fod- I eral elections from Washington is only the preludo of a general schomo of cen tralization. Gen. Haiibison approves, so far as he ventures to npprovo anything, tho propostorous scheme of national old to education ; Bonator Edmunds , turns up at the beginning of tho session with the proposal that the Oovernment shall found and conduct a unlvorsity. These are only straws, to be sure, but thoy indicate a wind that blows in the lnovltablo direc tion of Republican tendencies. Just at this j time theso tendonclos aro bound to bo 1 quickened and Increased. The people of new States aro usually in favor of tho old flag and an appropriation. Irrigation is rapidly becoming an important ques tion in the whole Rocky Mountain re gion, and the demand is already heard that tho Government should go Into tho dltch-dlgglng business. Conventions J asking for immenso appropriations for j I Western waterways are hold from time to ! time. Almost every "wook wo hear of sorao I new organization which proposes to reform the country by putting Into tho hands of y the Government the control and oven the 1 1 ownership of railroads, telegraph and telo- 1 1 phone linos, and more or less of the public j works and Improvements which now belong j! to corporations. Much of the talk in favor of j vast extensions of Government power is I j doubtless the more dripping of off-year polt- I I tics, but such as It Is the Republicans are F ready to take ad van taffo of it. When a states 1 1 roan like Mr. Edutjnds wants tho Govern II ment to ongage In tho telegraph business, I the point at which more radical and reckless II men will stop can only be conjectured. ill Something tho Republicans must do to .I quiet the Grangers of their party, and nicety I j about the Constitution is not a virtue known to the Republican Granger of the Iowa ill type. A big bolo in tho Constitution and jj A big hole in the Treasury, seems likely to bo III the Republican programme. It the natural ilJ lines between the principles of the Ropubll .'! can party and those of the Democratic party j are sharply drawn, and If the Democrats In ijjl Congress stick to the traditional Demo Jy cratlo policy of fidelity to the Constitution I I and economy In public expenditure, the ro ll! vlval of Federalism will only hasten tbe'res ' 1 toratlon of the Democracy to power. The Supreme Court Centennial. jj The programme for the celebration of the 1 one hundredth anniversary of tbeorganlza- I tlon of the United States Supreme Court 1 1 has just been announced. This oelcbra- j tlon Is to be conducted under the auspices j of the New York State Bar Association. It will consist of speech making, a banquet, i and a reception. The central figures will be LI the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices Ss. of the Supreme Court. President ILmuisox 5SPJfe andMr.GBOVEB Olxvxlam) will also par- EwJJ Oolpate In the exercises. V:Mf The proceedings will begin at half-past fci Jm Aiock on Feb. nexti with meeting at IT the Metropolitan Opera House, over which Mr. Gboyeb Cleveland will preside, and at whloh the members of tho Supremo Court will appear In their official robes. After a prayer by tho Rev. Dr. Moboan Due, will bo given at least Bovon addresses. Mr. William H. Abnoux, the President of tho New York State Bar Association, will welcome the guests; Mr. William Allen Botlxb of this city will speak on the origin and first organization of the Supreme Court; Mr. Hekbt Hitchcock of St Louis, on the exer cise of the powers of the Court; Mr, Thomas J. BEMins of New Orleans, on the personnel of tho Court, and Mr. Edwabd J. Phelts of Vermont, on tho relation of tho Court to tho pormanont administration of justice. Then tho Chief Justice will respond to what has been said by tho previous speakers, and something may be added by some of his asso ciates; and finally an address will be de livered by President Uaiuuson, to be followod by the singing of tho national hymn, "My Country, 'Tis of Thee." It Is announced that tho addresses will bo limited In duration to thirty minutes each; but even with this limitation the ceremonies can hardly fall to bo somewhat monotonous. It is difficult, of course, to glvo much life or varloty to a celebration of this sort, and at the samo time mam tain the proper degree of dignity and decorum. Some of tho speeches, howovor, ought to be worth hearing, and among theso will certainly bo the address of Mr. William Allen Butlbb, who Is one of the fow men in tho country to combine ac curate and elegant scholarship with high ability as a lawyer. After tho talking will come the eating and drinking, and this on tho same day. Pre sumably, there will bo speoohes also at tho banquet, and theso possibly will be of a lighter character than those to be delivered at tho Metropolitan Opera Houso. The din ner, at all events, ought to be a good ono, Inasmuch as wo notlco on tho committee which has ohargo of the entertainments and receptions the names of such well-known epicures as Joseph H. Croats and William M. Evabts of this city, and M. H. Hibsoii bebo of Newburgh, the newly elected Re publican District Attornoy of Orange county. It Is unfortunate that tho only resources of the Benoh and Bar at an occasion like this seem to bo talking, eating, and drinking. But so it Is; and wo cannot say that the Committee of Arrangements are to blame for not devising some more novel plan of celebration. Wo hope that the speeches will bo good and the feast splendid. President Abnoux will certainly be In his glory; but where, oh, .whoro, will) Col. Elliott Fbab NAuairr Shetabd bo on this auspicious occa sion ? If wo remember aright, It was he who originally proposed the celebration In the State Bar Association; and it Is passing strange that his name does not figure moro prominently In tho published programme. A Subsidy for a Magazine. A circular has been sent out to tho alumni of Yale College, appealing to them to save the New Englander magazine from extinc tion by furnishing it with an endowmont of $6,000 yearly for threo years. It is the mag azine or review more especially representing tho Intellectual energy of that Institution, and the reason of Its failure to securo a sale sufficient for Its support is described In the circular to bo its superior " culturo" and its refusal to publish fiction and to glvo pictures. But tho editors and publishers of the New Englander dccolvo themselves. Tho truo reason why it is unsuccessful is that tho public do not care for that sort of maga zine. Thoy can get better reading elsewhere, bettor literary ability treating tho same lino of subjects, higher cultivation, and pro founder thought and criticism. Even the college attachments of tho Yale alumni, and thoy aro especially strong, do not Induce tho great body of them to buy the magazine. It bores them, and probably fow of thoso who take it really read its pages. They send in their subscriptions for the most part, proba bly, from a senso of duty, a kind of charita ble feeling; but thero they stop. Loyalty to their collego docs not compel them to cut tho leaves and read the magazine. Tho periodicals which Interest them they do not buy from any such motlvo. Thoy buy them because they really want them, and not with any view to helping their editors and publishers along. If a periodical cannot get that sort of sup port, it is time for it to stop. Tho more it appeals to charity to keep it going, the worso off it will be. Tho Indifference of the public will change Into contempt Thoy will conclude, and rightly conclude, that If it was worth printing at all It would not need to bo subsidized, and moro especially after It had been In existence for many years. Such a circular as tho New Englander sends out is nothing less than a confession that it cannot hold Its own in competition with other magazines of a similar rango of dis cussion and criticism. So far from Indicat ing that its "culture" Is too high and fine, tho necessity for the appeal provos that it Is not high enough or fine enough for the pub lio tiujte, and that Its method of treating subjects of thought is not up to tho require ments of tho day. Its writers are too much hide-bound theologically, too timid, lacking In originality, outside of the intellectual current of tho period, and dull preachers of what the people havo grown tired of. Nor is it true that pictures and fiotlon are ossenliul to the success of a magazine with alms llko tho New Englander's. The North American Review and tho Forum seem to prospor very well without them, and prob ably many more copies of the English mag-a.-.lnos llko the Fortnightly, the Nineteenth Century, and tho Contemporary aro sold In this country than the whole edition of the New Englander. Tbore is a great and In ci cosine demand for the serious and careful discussion of all Important subjects. The number of pcoplo to which a really able and enlightened magazine appeals is many times more than when the Yale review was start ed. This appetite Is so general and has grown bo critical within tho lost fifteen years that even the periodicals of the lighter sort are compelled to make efforts to gratify It But tho trouble with the New Englander Is that it does not supply the want Instead of being ahead of the public it Is behind tho public in Intellectual growth. Its produc tions aro not up to tho standard of the period, and whether it gets $0,000 a year subsidy or not it must go under for it is tied back by shallow views of life and dis carded methods of thought and treatment. There Is no use for it. More money Is wanted to complete the status of Horace Obeki.kv. The model Is fin ished, but the treasury is not adsquate. The funds should be supplied at onco.

In the plan for re naming the nnvy proposed by Secretary Tracy In his annual report ho reeommended that armored eoast defsneo vessels should bo called "after Important events or names connected with the history of the United States." Ac cordingly he has made a beginning by giving the name Monterey to the coast defence armor clad now undor construction at the Union Iron Works In Ban Franolsco. Two Montereys. In fact, are celebrated in our history, one ot thorn bolng the scone ot tho victory gained by Qen. Taylor in Mexico fin tho 2ith of September, 181C, while tho other was the capital ot upper California, and the first spot occupied by our army and navy on that coast. It Is the latter, of course, which la now honored. Qen. Sher mnn has given a spirited description of tho looks of Monterey Hay and of the town itself on his arrival there as a lieutenant of artillery In Janu ary, 1847. As to tho sound ot the word, and this is ot no small Importance. It would bo hard to pick out a hotter ono for a war ship than Montoroy. Ournaalsorvlce, like all others, from time to time finds tho names of its vessels In such confusion that It has to glvo thorn an overhaul ing and In somo cases a rechristonlng. This was the case nltor the civil war. when Ad miral I'ortor got rid ot a grcnt many Indian names and substituted classical onos. Thoo rotioally, such an oxebaugo would bo pro nouncod a bad one: but it happoned thntat that time tho navy was burdened with abori ginal names, many ot thorn not only ofTenslvo to the ear, but carrying no special slgnlfloanco and quite unworthy ot being poriwtuated In this fashion tor dally usu. Among tho vessels co atnlctod were tho Mosholit, the Wassuc, the Kokn, tho Konosua, the Shamoklu, the Pushmataha, the rompanooBUr. tho Naubuo, tho Muscootn, the Hquando, tho Wyandank. the Nesbamluy, the Klcknpoo, tho Knusott, tho Mioiiamaxon, nnd a dozen othors as abom inable. (Jf course tbore aro many sonorouB. suituble, and suggestive Indian names lor os sein, such as Juniata, Narrogunsett. Tub caroro. Iroquois. Algonquin. Monadnock. Mo nongahola. Powhatan, llonnoko.

As to Montoroy, it Is not a now name to our navy. There was until recontly, and perhaps still Is, a tug ot that name at Mare Island: but this, of course, could not count ns an objection. Many oltios on tho i'nclllc have covotod tho honor of furnishing tho numo to the coast do fonce vessol, but tho unexpected decision In favor ot Montoroy will at loast bo accepted as a pood Illustration or tho nowsystora proposod.

It was the first flag of the Three Americas, and was designed by "Prof. J, W. Milnley or Bnru toga. Instead of the arrangement of stars used In our national standard, tho blue field was deoorated with an eagle guarding the western hemisphere, surrounded by a sym bollo wedding ring, while the background was formed by golden stars arranged in tho form ota southern oross.

At the late election there were aa many rotes cast in the Nineteenth Assembly district of this city as thsre are people, men, women, and children, In either of these three counties of the State Iutna in, Hamilton, or Schuyler. The majority g Wen to John It Fellows by the voters of this city In 1887 for District Attorney was 22,342 oyer the first of his competitors, 07,051 over the second, and 72,290 over tho third One of tho present Board of Tollee Justices haa an out standing claim for otllclal services rendered when the Hoard was differently constituted, but when he was a member ot it, of ti,util. There will be but three Republicans tn the Board ot Aldermen next year. They will hall from tho Seventh, hteventh. and fifteenth districts respectively. At no time since 1871 has the Republican party In thla city had so small a repreientatlon In the local legislative Board, and in the contemplation or It many rural Republicans can Cad food for reflection concerning the beauties ot home rnle. Kot vtrr many years ago a Republican pre sided over the deliberations ot the Board of Aldermen ot this city, and such a thing was not thought unoiual. but allies the powers ot the Aldermen have gradually been taken away by the Republicans and turned orer to the Legislature It has become more difficult to elect Re. publican Aldermen, and Incidentally to get votes for a Republican State ticket In New York city. These were tbo views of SamuelJ. Til den op the sub ject of spring elections as sent by him, when Governor, to the Legislature on May 1 1. 1875: "In voting upon the administration of local affairs, the popular attention and the po polar will should be freed aa far aa possible from disturbing elements, especially from complica tions with Mate and national politics The ancient sye tin which exists In the country, and worked well In New York for a generation, by which municipal eleo lions were held at a time Intermediate of the annual State and national elections, haa always commended itself to my judgment aa of great utility and value." The condition whloh confronts the Republican district managera In this city at this time la not one calculated to make their position enviable. They devoted a con siderable time laat year to the reorganisation of those Assembly districts In which disloyalty was charged or suspected, and. after a great deal of trouble and no end of worry and scandal, contrived to get John J. O'Brien and his followers beyond the breastworks, sending un avoidably a considerable number of Republican voters In the same direction. But this year they And the claims of treachery Just as loud and Just aa bitter aa before, and what makes the matter worse Is the fact that the dlstrlot leader against whom the charges have been prepared ot disloyalty to the county and local ticket Is the bead of the Republi can organization In town.

This Tear he finda himself In the position of the gallant but Inglorious John J. O'Brien, who, by the way, first brought Judge Smith Into politics In this city by nominating him tor the Assembly from his own district the Hlghth, In 1872, and by electing blm. In 1874 he ran again, bat was defeated. Then he moved uptown and became a Re publican reformer.

The quickest time on record, Ina political way, was that covered by Iceman Charles II. Turner, who was elected on Saturday, Nor. SO, to an office, the term of which began on Monday, Dec. Sunday being regarded In law as a dttt non, he may be said to havo been elected on one day to an office which he came Into possession of on the day following. As a rule, except In cases ot special election, a Congressman who Is chosen In No vember does not enter upon the actual discharge of hla duties until a year from the December succeeding, a hiatus of thirteen months occurring, which are some times occupied in stndying the Intricacies of legislation, but ufteuer In preparing tor a second term. Oddly enough, the only District Attorney to be elected for three terms In this county since the duties of the District Attoruey jtvere prescribed in the Constitution of ljj; was a Republican. Trior to that year the District Attorney ot New York prosecuted all the criminal cases which were brought In Kings, Richmond, Suffolk, and Westchester counties, as well aa those arising here, lhose were days when the Jurisdiction of the District Attorney was extensive, but when the duties of the office were tight, and contrast forcibly with the present state of affairs, when the business of the city of New York alone requires the united services of fourteen aFsistantn, In addition to tho .efforts ot the District Attorney himself. As a matter of passing Interest' to'Democrata It may be recalled that at the close of the Cleveland Adminis tration there were some 1 200 Republican hold overs In the Treasury Department at Washington, 1,674 In the Interior Department, and 448 m the Post Office Depart ment.

Kxnoeltion. Nice, Nov. 28. When I told ray friends In New York a short tlmo aco that I was about to tnnko n voraso to Europe In tho month ol No vember, I waa met with warnings and romon (trances on all hands. I waa told that "No vember la a month ot storms nnd dangera on tho Atlantic" I was admonished to "look out (or the Novembor fogs on tbo bnnks ot New foundland." I waa remtndod thnt It was In November that suoh and sued ahlpwrecki had boon reported. Iwru assured that Nooinbor Is a month much tearod by old mariners. " Von most know thnt Novembor Is n mouth that has a bad record on tho Atlantic" "Tlioro nronquitllsandothor thlnsa on tho lilch pons InNorembor. "Don't cross tbo briny at this tlmo of tho year." And thus I was besot with alarmlntr admoni tions and predictions that wero almost enough to proTcnt nny ono from confronting tho stormy main in Norombor. All of thorn, howersr. wero unavailing. In view of tho ordorn Riven by tho doctor. So, on the 2d ot November, I struck out from Now York. In tho steamship Ben In, to cross tho At lantic Tho Novembor voyaco of nlno days from Now York to Liverpool wn In oory wnr satNfnc tory. Wo had no ilruitoroiiH sens, we had no houvy foitB, wo hud no tomiioituous ruIob. our hip did notplteh.nnd wo oncountoroil nothing that was nlnnnlnc. Tho skies wore cloudy throueh most ot tho voyugo, but wo ciijoyod both sunshine und moonshlno at tlmos. Tho weather was mild: tho broezes wero both brnclurx and bonollcont. Everything wont wolt on shipboard from the groat Amoilcun seaport to the English port. Tbo doctor's orders wero to try tho climate of southorn Tinnce, on tho Modltcrrauonn, nt Nice. Here, nguln, I enjoyed tho benollt of much advice from Now York friends bofoio loavlDg tbo city. "Don't ro to Nlco," said ouu of thorn, "for the cure of norvous prostration. It's cllrantoistoo dry, and tha air thorolmkB the' Wtallzlnc Juries. (Jo to western Trance, somewhoro alone the liny cf Ill&cuy, and enjoy tho bracing breezes In any of tho coast liamletH ot tlio Glrondo." "(Jo to tho I'yronoos," sold nnothor ,ev Vork frlond, "il you would strengthen tho nerves; ro high up among tliu mountains; take In tho country beiwiion l'nu undttarbonno; you Kill find in the 1'yrencos tho moat IIIo-ctvlnR air to be found in Europe, nnd jou will tlnd uKo plenBant domiciles and plenty of opportunities lor wholosomo oxorclHe initio oponulr." " Now, don't ro to Mco to sain nervous vigor," wild nnotUor Now York frlond: "try souio ono of tho llnloarlo Isles, In tho Mediterranean, wliero 1 rnysolf have lived with the Rrouto.-t benollt to health, and whoro there is un enjoyable cllmnto nt this soason of tho year. Try JIaioreu, Mi norca, or Irica. where Juo Is riulot nnd IhlnR Is chooii." Another New York friond said: "I would not go to Mce, which Is a placo of ex citement and frivolity, the resort of fashion, but 1 would try somo riulot region of southern Italy, or. still bettor, Algorla. whore in tho wintertime you will enjoy a climate both go nlnl and Invigorating." iflnully, a festlvo Now loiker, familiar with northern Kurono. as sured mo that tho thing to do, evon in wlntor, wob to take In the crisp breo?os that blow nloug tho shores ot onstorn bwodon. Thus my Now York friends proceeded with thotr advice until 1 had been advised to try the cllinato ot nearly all tho regions that lie be tween uppor Africa and the Bnltia Ben, But, after all, I concluded to obey the orders of my faithful New York doctor, who had de termined that tho placo for mo was Nloe, and hero I arrived a week ago. It looks ne though his judgment had been sound. Here, ut this time, in tho closing da) a of the month ot Novembor. tho people are enjoying such a clime as I havener or before known anywhero In the wintry season. The dally sunshine glorlllesa landsoape of unsurpassed beauty; the air is genial and balmy: numerous flowers not known in northern soil are in full bloom; theornngos, lies, and other fruits aro ripening; the palm and tho pine are robed in the richest green; nnd tho blue Mediterranean, which touches tho shoi es of three continents, vparkles softly under the cloudless skies. The weather wag wintry In New York whon I left thoro at ina Deginningor riovemDer: it is ol tho early autumnal variety hero in Nice at the ona of the same month. In coming here to Nice I passed through i ranoe from north to south, and got a gllmpso of Paris. Here again I was reminded of re marks that I had heard from New York friends, that 1 would get to Paris just too late to see all tho wonders of the great Exposition. Well, tho Exposition had, closed while I was yet at boh, but there are still plenty of Its relics to bo seen by people who like to look at them. Tho Eiffel Tower stili stands where it stood : the most im posing structures that were erected for tho oc casion are yet in their plnoos ; many of the pic turesaue foatures of the Exposition are still to be seen in their pristine beauty; many of the things that wero displayed at it are yot to be found not far away; and the visitor to I'arU In theso times Is soon made awaro that tho Exposition of 1889 ha? left n lasting Impression npon the city, bos givon it novelties In many lines of Industry nnd genius, and has left behind it monuments ot durable value and Interest to the Erenoh people. Myriads of New Yorkers know by personal ob servation thnt l'arls is a speotaonlor city at all times; and those of them who hnvo not seen it this yenr may rost assurod that the Exposition has permanently extended its attractions in that respeou John Bwihton.
