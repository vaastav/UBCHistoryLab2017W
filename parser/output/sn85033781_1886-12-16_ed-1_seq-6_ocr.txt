The board makes no estimate of its coht. Ita cordial in doreiaent of the canal on coimnercial and military crounda will prove a inaterM help to the frienda of tho caual.

Tho Annual Report of tho Sec retary of ho Treas- u: Discontinuance or the Purchase of Silver Stmicriy KecJin uie:i led. Tha Question of Reducing tho Sur plus Tho Tax of Raw Kate riah to 0 Seduced. The nnnnal reixirt of tho Hon. Daniel Man ning, Secretary of tho Treasury, is a heavy doc ument of nearly twenty-four thousand words. The main features of the r ort are as follows : Cureful perusal of the lutru'tivo debates ut the laHt session of Congress leads me to review tue four iolicic8 which then received marked utteiition : 1 Free coinage of silver. 'i. Conferences. 3. Continued purchases of silver. 4. Stepping purchases of silver. First -The freo-eilvi r coinage prescription for the monetary dislocation satisfies but one of fcevtrul indisj ensttb.o conditions. While it is 1:11 indispensable (ouditiou of permanent re storation that the free iiionetiatiou of silver t-littll be equally cmplteasof g'dd, yet were it now eiveu to silver in this actual moment f dislocation the practical rosult would be to withdraw tlyi same lrm gold. That would bo a change without advantage in any respect, and in every rcsjs'ct with disadvantage. In the first place it would bring us to the Asiatic silver basis. This has been commenced in some quar ters. Ther j is, however, no suc h public desire. Second More conferences, further diplomatic correspondence aro promised. I venture to think, w itlialldue deference to those who are responsible foi a decision, that the time for another conference has not arrived, and that the moment for diplomatic interference is not perfectly felicitous. The Continental Powers aw nit the action of (ireat Hnta-in, w hose reluc tance defeated the object of both conferences called at the instance of the Cnited States, and to whom again, almost within a twelvemonth, she has turned a deaf ear. If it suited the dig nity cf the Cnited State 8 again to besiege the attention of Kuro)sHn states, er again to make advances where they have becu so lately re pulsed, it would not suit our inttretts so to do when it is certain that the inquiry upon which Great ltritaiu has suddenly entered at the iu stance und insistence of he r gn at dependency, India, and of her own accord, is entered uioii with an exclusive regard to her own interest. And eif (ireat Dritaiu's interests tho Cnited States have no call to become advisers or gun rd inns. Third To go on as wo are is the least credit able of all the courses open to our choice. Tho Treasury silver purchase is defended by nobody, approved by nobody; even every vote for the free coiunfioof silver is a vote that the Treasury silver vurchaso shall ceaso, an asser tion thai it ought to cease. Fourth To stop the purchase of r-ilver is our only i' 1m lice, our elutv, and our interest. It will stop a wasteful and injurious expense, and tho taxation which defrays it. It will commenco ami promote reform in the sum and the meth ods ef 1- ederal taxation. It will recover to tin United Stute s nn equality f position (non coinage) with foreign lowers which will give us due influence in negotiation. It will induce negotiation, and rufotintlcn to tho end of relief, not ferthe purjstse of delay. If the law were repealed w hich makes compul sory Treasury purchases of silver, and if that repeal were accompanied by the declaration of CemgrcsH that tho United States now holds iUelf in reudincss to unito with France, Germany, and Great Hritaln in opening their lulu's to the free coinage eif silver und gold at a ratio fixed by international agreement, it is the deli! ernte judgment of tho undersigned that before the cxpiratien of another fl.-oal year tins interna tional monetary dislocation might be corrected by such an international concurrence, tho two monetary metals restored tJ their old and uni versal function as the one standard measure of rices for the woill's commodities, tho de pression of trade and industry relieved, and a general prosperity renewed. I rcsjx'ftfully recommend to tho wis lorn of Cougre-sB tho unconditional repeal of the act of Feb. 2s, IsTh, accompanied by such a dcclara ti n. The financial situatkn. scatmed nt large and as a whole, plainly indicates our b st policy. Meslxmld reduce taxation immediately to an annual revenue sulhVint to pay our annual ex penditure, including the sinking fiin4 ruid ex cluding the Bilve r purchase: pay our unfunded debt of ?)('.Hl,(lii with the present surplus and the fundus which will accrue Kefore the whole reduction of taxation can be mmle to take erlect. und while no more funded debt can be paid exce pt ut r premium during tho five years from now until ls.il. I therefore resjx-ctfully recommend : 1. Hepeal of the clause iu the act of Feb. 2, 1H7H, making compulsory 'Ireasury purchases of ilvcr, and for the reasons heretofore given iu order to reduce surplus und unnecessary taxa tion i'.'4.'SiO,ooo a year. 2. Further reduction of surplus taxation, be ginning in a manner which will bo suggested below, close down to the necessities of the Gov ernment economically administered. 3. Hepeal ef tho act of May 31, 178, making compulsory iHst-redemption issues and reissues of Unitenl Slates legal-tender notes, thus facili tating 4. Gradual purchase end payment of $34o,CM,. Olr, e utstanding promissory notes of tho United Mates w itli present and accruing Treasury sur plus, issuing silver certificates in their room, and gold certificates if need be, w ithout contrac tion of the present circulating volume of the currency, these notes 'called greenbacks! being now the only de-bt duo and payable before Jh-.u except the 3 percent. bonK which are probably nil to be called aud paid early in the ensuing fiscal year. iirnrcTioN ok srnri.rs taxation. It remains to conside r the reduction of taxa tion to the needs of the Government economi cally i.duJnistered. What surplus we expend in paying off U e grHniack dc4t will diminish by so much the in mediate redaction of eur tariff taxation ; for, while the funded debt stands, certainly it is not w ise to discard the taxes em whisky, tobacco, and beer. Indeed.it is mv wn belief that w heneve'J w e legiii taking oil the shackles of war-tariff taxes on raw 1 Ma terial such increased prosperity will follow to tho employers w ho dread it, rind such larger and steadier employme ut to the wage-eaniers who need it, by increiuiug tho sales uKroad of our own manufactures, and by whipping our foreign cempetitors in our own iutrkets, that wo hhull see our income f rem imported msuHfart ures dwindle so fat as not only to com pi 1 the retention of these most fit items of revenue whisky, tobacco, anl beer hut, ierhaim, to drive us back to getting ten millions of revenue from two cents a pound tax em collee and haJf as much fniu tea. It is the reduction of war-tariff taxation which we have to consider. Under our system of gov ernment bv 1 a tv, and the rule of the majority, I do not think it unbecoming eve n in a public Oflicer at this time to recall certain responsible and sj-cific pledge s iu respe ct to tho sum and lnethodst f Federal taxation, subject to which the lx'oplo of the United Mates. In the exercise of a lawful election, took away the administra tion of this (iovernene nt from the party en trusted therewith for a quarter of aeeutury, and lodged it in other hands. Public life will cease to be the Ambition of honorable nud worthy men If the deliberate pledges anil professed principles of olittcul parties are not a law for tlosir leaders. Dis charging, if I might, whatever hostility of tone, now irrelevant, it cemtairis, I elesire to refer to the record of one public obliga tion thus assumed, and thus accepted, and made binding by Ue last general 1opular vote. These pledges ) can never e fulfilled without a reform in the sum and methods of Federal taxation. Nor can our country ever profit fully by its I' comparable advantages nmong tho nations of iuo earth in jxipulatioii, peac, land, and liberty, so long as we go ou pleading infancy, and swaddle, in me dia'val rags, its victorious energies. It is these which need re lease and liberty. All our requi site taxation maybe iua4e an easy garment.

EXPOHTS AND THE TAK1KP eN HAW MATETlMI.H. The total value of our domestic exerts for the last fiscal year was almost exactly G7. 000,000, of which Hi percent were the pnslucts t.f our fields, forests, flshi ries, and mines, and 10 per cent, only were the sum total of manu factured products in which American labor was inwrought. In the last quarter of a century 1 regress In telegraphs, transjiortatlon, labor-saving inven tlons, and tLe inechsnto arts has reduced the proLts of capital and the rato of interest by more than one-balf ; has Increased the wages of llor throughout tho world; has augmeuted by at It ast a third the surplus which onr jnanufae turors t an produce beyend domestic nee els for sal j abroad, l'n longfng without necessity our wi.r tariff taxes on raw materials, wo have been unt!erold und excluded from ft reign mar ket ky natiens not taxir-g raw materials. Despite their low-j riced, inferior labor and tho high rerceiitiico of labor-cost there- ! fore included in their product, our taxed riw muteiials m.d their iree raw mate rials have j rote-c-ted the so-called "pau er lulxr" of i.uroi e against American ct rn petition. Our increasing capacity to prexluce an indus trial sirplusngo has been accompanied by war taxation exnctly suite-d to prevent the sale ef that surplusage in fi r. ign markets. Out of our actual abuntlaiice this war taxation has forged the ins rumei.t e.f our industrial and commer e iil mutilation. Defeating our manufacturers in their eixle aor to compe'to abroad with the manufacturers of untaxed raw materials, it has set tlom en a ferocious competition at cut throat ) rices in 01. r own home murker, to which they are shut ui, and for which their produc ing towers are increasing surM'rubuudantly. I a rig period it of glut and so-called ove rpro duction have alternated with brief ieriols of reuewed activity anl transient prosperity liko the pre sent. These proloute1! wiur-taritf taxes, incompetent and brutal as a scheme I I revenue, fatal to tho existence tf our foreign market, and disorderly to our domestlj trade, have in the last resort acted and reacted with mot ruinous injury upon our wage-earners. As the most numerous part ef our imputation, our w age-earners are, of course, tho first, the last, and the most to be affected by injurious laws. F.verv Government, by true statesmanship, will w atchfully regard their condition and interests. TAXES TO 11ETAIN. Another proposal is to reduce taxation by cut ting down the tax e n wisky, tobaccei, and beers, and removing tiie iluty en sugar. Nolxnly paya a tux on tobacco except the consumers of to bacco. '1 hey are willing to Miy for the luxury, und they ask 110 relief. Any probable reduction ot the tux on whisky would bit more likely to increase the revenuo than to diminish it. The price of sugar has fallen to an exceedingly cheap rate. Our own sugar crop is so very small a part of the total amount t f sugar xve consume that sugar ranks next to articles wholly produced abroad, like tea and eclY-e. in suitability for taxation, en the ground that its consumption is universal, that the tax is easily and cheaply collected, that the increased price p lid by tho consumers is an unconsidered trifle, and that what is taken from the taxpayers goes into the taxpayers' treasury, not into a few private bank accounts. Like the casting away of tho revenue from coffee and tea in ls7'2, tho removal of tho tax iu sugar, which gives us our easiest and next to largest single item of revenue 0"l,7i.yPM, at an annual coetof less than ninety cents per head, is now pressed forward to avert the repeal of other tuxes w hich ure desire.1 toeqrute an incidental and private be nefit by enhanced prices to tho domestic consumers of a largo domestic product. Theso incidental and private benefits in fact are subject to all the deductions I have already mentioned, and are subject to the chief deduc tion that the erwleavor to make tur tax laws ex clude foreign competition in our home markets preuiotes the success of that conijetition, besides effectually preventing tho sale of our surplus prtsluct, 01. r Jal r prvduct, in for eign markets. Hut the incidental benefit of the sugar tax to our cane-sugar jiroducers, who aro under tho harrow of beet-sugar competition and German bounties, which have driven them to improved irocesseB and already lowered tlio price of sugar more than the removal of tho whole tax, is not j.ec by excludiug foreit'ii sugar, for the grout bulk of our sweetening comes from climates more tropical thein onrs. Nor does it prevent eur sales iu foreign markets of iui jorte'd sugars refinel and increased iu value by the process ef American labor. Dl'TlEH T HE HEMITTED. The taxes to lj fr.t remittel are those which preve nt or hinder the sale ef onr surplus prod uctei in foreign markets. Their ren.eival will set ca-)itul in motion by tho promise tf better returns, enlarge the steo-ly cioplounevit iuel increase the annual incomo of many t lousand wave-earners, wtit.se jirosiH-rity will dilfuso prosperity. These taxe s are the duties en raw materials, and the mot xvidely injuritus of them is tl'.o tax uimij raw wsl. Hut the in come erf all the wage-earners in tho I nited States can be at enco enlarged elfec ive ly, ccr tuinly, permanently, by reducing the cect to them' ed the great necessities ef life. Our war timff taxes incrtiiso needlessly the cost of clothing, shelter, fcxsl to every family. Kvery wage-earner's expense, every taxpayer's ex pense, for the clothing of himself and his family is nearly doubled, at least in the Northern, Middle, "and Western Stute-s, by taxation which can now Ik remitted, yet leavu the Treasury a sufficient revenue. The duty en raw w ool procured for the Troaa ury last year only $5,P2f,lVs. The cost ef wool en'clothing for our 5.,ooo,0 m 1 oople was thereby arhl t the rwise enhanced many times more than JO cents a head, tho e'nly ce.st of our 51,77s,!4s revenue lrtm sucar. Moreover, any tax en raw weol imiiorteid will always make domestic wool-raU-ing u biul business ; for, in our dry climate?, miih varieties ef wool required by the manu facturer are not produced. The tax prevents our manufacturers from competing in foreign markets with all manufact urers who can 1 uy untaxed. wool. The tax prevents our manufacture and expert ef competing wtmlens that require the use or admixture of non-American wi.ols, and so restricts th" borne demand, and the grwth of the home demand, for domestic wool thus making the exjKirt tf emr ek mestic w-ool-en- imi ossilde, yet involving the enhanced price of foreign and domestic woedens. This pettv tax of t ,12 .los on raw wesd assists in nearly doubling tho actual cost ef their clothing to the" American tmple, with no real and no i in cidental benefit to anybody except tho foreign manufacturer. WOOL SHOULD UK ON THE FUKE LIST. I respectfully recommend to Concrtss that they confer ujkui the wage-earners of the United States the boon of untaxed clothing, and in or icr thereto, the immediate passa-je ef iui net simplv and solely lacing raw wtol upon the free list. Of course, a reie:il ef the eluty on raw wool should be follow ed by, but need not wait for, u compensating adjustment of tho duties on manufactured woolens, whilst our manufac turers aro learning the lesion that, with the highest paid and most efficient laUr in the world, w ith tho most skilled management and the best inventive appliance'', they need fear no compctit on from any rivals in the world, in home er foreign market e, so long im they can buy their wools free, t f every kind. Hnt the common dally clothing of the American people need not Wo taxed ; therefore, it ought not to bo taxed ; to free their c.eUdng of taxes xvill finally re'duce, by half, their expenso for one of the three greiit necessitien ef life, und thus enlarge honestly and justly tho income of every wage earner in the United States. Hut this re duction ef unnecessary aud injuri ous taxation is iut enoeigh, and will epvrate slowly in diminishing revenue. Last year's iuiiHirttaxorirawwo.il is little more than the mere growtli last year tf onr tixes from whisky, tobacco and beer. To make wool free of tax may actually work a larger loss of revenue by enabling our weiolen manufacturer to under sell at a profit the fort ten impoitfrs who brought in last year $4'),53fl.5r. worth tf manu factures of xvool. from which we got a tax of k'27,27s,52H. To sav nothing of other taxes ujH'n raw materials, there are several hundred articles among the 4,1-2 articles that we tax w hich ought at once tt be swept off the tax list into the free rist ictiy, vexatious, needless taxes, much enlarging the test ef col lecting the revenues from imHit. I shall at an eurly day prepare and suomit to Cengres a supplementary retort vn the cedlectkn of duties. Daniel Manninu. Secretary of tho Treasury. JEPAttTMKNT OF JUSTICE. Itrcoimnemtat ions of Attorney General Garland In His Annnal Krport. The annual report of Attorney General Gar land contains a detailed statement cf the busi ness of the Department of Justice for the last fiscal year, together with statistics of crime against the United States.

Mr. Hreck inridce, of Arkansas, objected to the immediate consiJeration of the bill, expressing the opin ion that the poople of the country were as mr.ch in need of relief fiom taxation as the people of Kastport. He was glad to find the gentleman from Maino confessing that the tariff was a tax, and lie would insist that the bill should take the regular course and be sent to tho committee which had charge of tho subject of taxation. The bill was referred to the Com mittee on Ways and Means. Mr. Dockery (Mo.), on behalf of tho Committee of Postoffices and Post Hoads, called up the bill extending the free-delivery system to towns having 10,OH) population, and where the revenne of the 0fct o.'fico amounts to tlo,o.K) a yoar.

The Senate then proceeded to tho consideration of Mr. Morrill's resolution, which declares that the promise e.f making any revision of tho tariff in a spirit e.f fairness to all interests appears so obviously hopeless nnd impracticable that any furthe"r at tempts at revision by the present Congress are to be regarded as inexpedient, aud detrimental to the revival of the trade and industry of the country. Mr. .Morrill said the Deimvcratic can elidate for Preside nt in ls-vi would have leen defeated but for the tariff p.ank in the plat form. Ho ridiculed Mr. Morrison's schemes for a horizontal reduction tf the tariff, and said that their effect could only be to let a tltssl ot foreign productions pour in and overrun too Amerlcaa market Mr. Heck said that when the leader iu the hen ate on financial questions the Chairman tf the Committee on Finance gavo out in udvan-e, in a resolution and sp ech. that nothing e eiuld be lone to improve e.xistlng conditions, it w as like rallying his friends in lulvance in epositiori to every movement.
