Unfoitunate as is the necessity for having a so-called tetnni.s court of m ltiiry St. U)Uis is to Ik- congratulat'il Ion the thoroiighiicss with which tlie j)rescnt investigation is to be conducted. Mayor Wells is working for the inter ests of the public when he Insists that the blame for the deaths from lockjaw following the injection of antitoxin shall lip definitely ftxed. St. Louis ha tiecome a center of in terest Imtwiuw of the death. In this city there is no doubt that negligence xeuicwhere i rcsjionslblo for the calam ity. Faith in the efficacy of tlie antitoxin treatment for diphtheria is unshaken. The fact's already known leave only one conclusion to lie drawn. It is that there lias been carelesr.ue.-s. Outside St. Louis there may be a sus picion that this city is at a loss to ac count for the deaths, the antitoxin treatment may be unfairly condemned. The placing of tlie blame will remove every doubt us to the real cause. iWEAKIFUL XEWS. In view of the assembling of Congress . . a ... a....... mnftjiM tf fill. to conMuer aao act uiruu montio .. - gravest national import one would be Inclined to think that President Koose velfa tribulations as arbiter of the miserable HtUc factional light among Missouri Kepnbllcans would thereby be brought to an end, more dignified work demanding bin attention. This is not the case, however; the Missouri Kepublican "outfit" being as difficult to get rid of as the mange. The I'resldcnt now finds to his dismay that the onenlnc of tlie Congressional ees- - slon merely Intensifies his trouble with regard to MIsouri. Colonel Kerens s friends in the Senate, we are told, will now begin to buttonhole Mr. Koosevelt In behalf of that well-nigh deposed leader. They will be deployed against the President In battalions, assailing his position by frontal and flank charges alike, until there will be no rest for the poor man. A the latest development In tlie Kerens-Hitchcock fight, this liews of the Senatorial "rush"' on Jlr. Iloosevelt is deprcM-Ing to folk inclined to sympa thize with the President. There Is n growing conviction that he i IHng worked overtime in this tight, and that the work is also a bit beneath the dig nity of a. President of the United States. - the n ot sordid of spoils conflict"!. the Il!tch(ick-Kcreus leuu ought not lo .be allowed great swing In Washing ton.

WHAT ELSE? The Glolte Bays 'faint fair" because The Republic brands some of Its state ments as plain lying. Not only is It fair but necessary. The ejlublic has never attributed inten--lional lying to tlie Globe except when lxilli the lie and tlie intention were evi dent. The act and its moral nature must then lie described in the usual lerni understood by tlie people. Examples can at any time be fur iilrhed. Hcie Ik one: Tlie Glolie. on the School Fund con version, says: "As the sale of the Gov ernment bonds was followed by the pur chase of State Imuds. it was quite nat Tual (hat the sharp blinks and their partners in Die background should run tip the price of State bonds, tlie State of Missouri itself being the purchaser." The published history of the transfer explains tluit the State bonds were pur cliascd before the Pulled States lionds were sold; tin; object of Governor Har din and Stijierhitendcnt Shannon being Jo avoid exactly what the Globe falsely depicts as having happened. The sale of United Stales bonus was held back until the State bonds were bought, so that the price nf'lhe latter could not I ruu-up." The Globe knows the fact. Therefore 11 has lied and lied inieiitiounlly. How cau the public understand the Globe's titnglcx unless the essential core of falsehood Is ej;iM)sedV The Globe brings upon itstlf tlie reputation of chronic mendacity. OHIO SITUATION. Until the Forakcr forces give a prac tical demonstration of their strength which proves the soundness of the claims now being made to the effect that they arc masters of the situation In Ohio, the cautious student of political affairs will continue to believe In tlie potency of Senator Hanna as the Re publican Boss in that State. ' There is no convincing indication as yet that a combination has been formed lu Ohio which will surrender the State to Hauna's enemies of his own party, and, through control of the Legislature, defeat Banna's re-election to the Senate, thus retiring him from public life. In deed, with President Roosevelt using the administration influence In HannaVs behalf, should he do so, the Foraker 'task of wresting Ohio fi 1 Uuunats control will be as difficult as during President McKlnley's lifetime. The overthrow of Hanna as political itoUtor In Ohio will come about, If at all. Ix-raiiM; jf President Roosevelt's failure to perceive wliy he fcliould es pecially exert himself to perpetuate the machine of a Boss who was aii autl Koosevelt man at the time of Roose velt's sorest political need. Senator Hanna distinctly relented Roosevelt's development as a Presidential posslblll ty and tji.-ir(d no effort to keep him more In the background. He diil not fnr.if I,...w...-..lt ,tl 1... r...fr-V '"ITlflflt.'ltl " uuv-rtcu Hi m- .. j - .-- wnen ITeMUelit .Mclviniey s heconu tmu "" should haw rtarli.-d a close. -Many be - -1 li.'v, indeed, that Ilaima himself as - pires to be the Kepubliran nominee for I'resldcnt In

There are many who doubt that litis .-pcciacle will ever be wit nessed. ".MI'CII C.TL'MT." As the Ololie-Lreiuocrat remarks, "It Is a good rule to hear lioth sides of a question." And if both sides may ! heard from tlie same authority there is hope of a Just judgment, provided the authority does not obscure tiie is-iiie by approving first one side and then the other. A wabbier deserves contempt. Es pecially de-pieable in a wabbling polit ical organ. The fact that a paper at first states that a thing is good and then changes it mind without having a single new fact with which to support the contention is conclusive evidence either that something is wrong In the mental capacity behind the opinion or that a wanted interest does not stop at misrepresentation. Yet this is what tlie Globe has done. November 10, ls7.". when tlie announce ment of the completion of the School Fund conversion was made, tlie Globe recited the facts and congratulated tho Board of Education on its work. The State Superintendent was thanked for his earnest work in behalf of the schools. To quote the commendation exactly "Much credit is due the Board of Educa tion. As the investment is now made, the yearly interest is materially Increased for school purposes." There was no evasion in this indorsement of the sale of the United States bonds be longing to the School Fund and the in vestment of the proceeds in Missouri bond. Twenty-six years after the Globe spoke thus fraukty- about the matter the tune is changed. There is much prating about tlie "violation of a sacred trust by a Democratic administration." The insinuation In made that the of ficials "earnestly engaged" in the trans actions made rake-offs. To-day the Globe says that the deals were made in a corner without the knowledge of the people. Yet the de tails were published in the Globe-Democrat after the completiou-of tlie deal. "Much credit is due the Board of Edtira tlou." Those were the words ued in 1875. And if the Globe instead of lying spvke the truth concerning the matter to-day, would the phrase not be re peatcd? WHY THEY RESENT. If tlie Globe were exposing' faults and detecting crime in State government the TK-opIe of M!ouri would willingly en dure even the injury due to the spread of exaggeration. But the Glolie, for nothing better than the reason that lurks in a hope of spoils. i ' :.''"! !v falsifying conditions andl unscrupulously hunting for expedients of misrepresentation. It goes so far that it calls itself a con spir&ti.r with crime that is, it professes now to believe criminal certain acts of government which it unreservedly ap proved when they were performed. That is why the people of Missouri resent the Globe's policy. THE GREATER SOUTH. Mr. Richard H. Edmonds's summa rized showing of increased prosperity In the Southern States is consistent with many recent developments pointing to the strong likelihood that the South is now at the beginning of an era of ex ceptional advancement. The report submitted by'Mr. Edmondi to the Manufacturers' Record mut lie taken as accurate and authoritative. I'.ased on tlie writer's personal observa tion and made without bias or sectional favor, tlie article should attract wide attention. It t-hows that the States of Louisiana. Texas. Alabama, North Caro lina and Tennessee have made especially notable strides in the recent past, while the entire South is in a prosperous con dition never before equaled. The jieopie of the South have reason to fa-e the future with a splendid con fidence. Within the past ten years the development of their section of the Union lias been one of the marvels of the tiiiK. The next quarter of a cen tury must inevitably witness an even gnater progress. The New South has already arrived. The Greater .South is now in sight. EXILE FOR ANARCHISTS. Senator Hoar's advocacy of the pun ishment of anarchists by exile and iso lation on some desolate and remote spot of the earth's surface seems a trifle at variance witli modern ideas, but such a itcnalty for such. a crime as anarchy is emlneiitlyappropriate. Memliers of, anarchistic societies are I enemies of mankind, xney would sub stitute chaos for order. They hate and denounce all government. The cardinal duty of the boldest among them is the assassination of the foremost represent atives of established society. They preach lawlessness and murder. The man Czolgosz was the creature of anarchy. To his ill-balanced mind the feat of assassinating the President of the United States was made to appear as a heroic performance. The profes sional anarchistic agitators egged him on to his bloody deed. Every anarchis tic society in the United States support ed his undertaking in spirit Ail of them rr.''ited when he kiihd President McKinley. Isolated In exile on some forlorn spot agreed upon by all the civilized nations of earth, Senator Hoar suggests, the world's anarcliistsicould there put Into practice their theory of living without government. True, they would he sub jected to two forms of hardship pe culiarly repugnant to anarchists they would have to work and they would no looser be in quick touch with a beer cellar but they would be as free a air in so far as the hated restraint of government is concerned. On their own remote island they could do :f they pleased, even to the extent of dynainil 1 im,' one another, and no one el-e would 1 even whimper. Anar.liist-Kolatiou is an excellent suggestion. 

"KING FARMER." I'p to the preiicnt moment tlie outside speculator, in many In-tances the farm er, has been sharing largely in the profits gained from the sudden bull movement in grain on the Chicago Board of Trade, ami the continued out side demand reflects tlie jubilation cai-l by this fact. Tlie situation is regarded as inot un usual for this reason. That any but the shiewd ami -killful professional "change traders should reap the benefit of a notable speculative movement is a matter of surprKe to tiie initiated. The explanation giveu is that, lor once, the people in tlie country were quicker to foresee an advance than were the trad ers. The rural speculator is, therefore, quite a figure on the Chicago Board of Trade just now, rejoicing in the proud title of "King Farmer," won by his luck. In the finish of this bull movement the untrained dabbler in the bpeculative markets will do well to keep a cool head on his shoulders. The market Is now said to be well under the control of cer tain big grain houses In Chicago and there is talk of an organized corner. In the further changes of the quotations. tlie.se inliueuccs will count potently. Prices will run as the controlling linns desire. The period of greatest danger for the outsider is reached at such a point. Wisdom would seem to dictate that "King Farmer" look to his crown closely, lie will not wear it at tho close of the deal unless he matches w Ith caution ;he shrewdness of the trained speculators playing the game against him. BUSINESS SENSE. Among all the World's Fair feats none is greater than the completion of the arrangement whereby the Exposition will have the use of the Washington University buildings. No exception can be taken to the pro vision whereby tho Fair management is assured a continuation of the lease past 1!X)3. On the contrary, common business sense dictates that such a contract should be made. Every business man mattes provision for possible, even im probable, contingencies. No inference that the Fair will not be held in 1003 can be drawn from the ac tion of the World's Fair Directors and the Trustees of Washington University. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition will j open April SO, 100o. Only an insur mountable obstacle could make po-sible its postponement. Up to this date no such obstacle has presented Itself. "Much credit is due tho Board of Education" declared the Globe-Democrat in 1875, speaking of tlie School Fund conversion. No stronger commen dation has been passed upon the action by any paper since. And at that time all the facts were fresh and before the Globe. According to the Globe-Democrat the Republicans received no contributions from the corporations. Yet itcpublicau memlsers of uie Legislature voted oha ly for corporation measures. Perhaps tho iioor unsophisticates did not know any better. A Kansas City man boasts of having told Republican State Chairman Akius that he would never lead the party to victory in this Slate. Uhe tale is true but it is also true that no other man can lead the Republicans lo success in Mis sou rL Sternberg of the Board of Lady Man agers of the World's- Fair have decided to work without compensation. They known that satisfaction from a deed well done Is the highest reward. Friends of tlie World's Fair are work lng for the Fair's opening in 1!K).'J. The "knockers" stand off to one side and predict that the opening must be iost poncd. Park Commissioner Ridgely, in urging the building of Mnall parks in the down town districts of tlie city, appreciates a need that should be met immediately. President Rocsevelt commends the World's Fair to the world and Presi dent Francis promises that the World's Fair will deserve the commendation. Alwut the worst comment that has been made upon the President'.- message Is from Senator Hanua, who thinks, thai no improvement could be made. Whenever a Missouri Kepublican feels "scrappy" these days he jumps on the train and hastens to join tlie "outlit's" war-dance around the President. Those Ute Indians who visited Presi dent Roosevelt tlie other day were not anything like as fecalp-kuifery as tho Hitchcock-Kerens tribe. St. Louis was robbed of thousands of dollars through license tag frauds. No guilty persons should be allowed to es cape by a technicality. During the approaching seasou of peace on earth and good will among men the Hitclicock-Kerens scalp-dance .should be prohibited. Having now learned just what the Fifty-seventh Congress stands for, let's try and enjoy a Merry Christmas before the worst conies. December 'M, 1901, will lie "Flag Day" in Missouri nnd Old Glory will then proudly consent to wave as the World's Fair standard. As a sure sign that VM1 has been a prosperous year the Increasing throngs cf holiday shoppers should be appre ciatively noted. What more could anarchists nsk than to Uvp in an isolated "annrolilst colony with no government and unlimited dynamite? i j

Kranci oJ the World's Pair Company has a signed article In ihu Christmas juimb-r cf the Saturday nivn.ne lost of I'hil.tueliih:ii on -Tne Coming World's Fair." in which he directs himself to a discus3ioa c the Exposition in theie words: "It is an impracticable task to comprise within thy limits of a mjEazine ankle the Plan and scon. nf th. ti?-.t. -...! i.fn:ivf.in.-t Purchase Exposition, commonly knocn as tlie St. Louis World's Fair, to say nothing of the impossibility of adequately describ ing its dttal!3. Primarily, the St. Louis World's Fair of 3.-33 cannot appropriately be co:riared with, or contrasted Tilth, any other World's Fair, for the reason that its plan is unlike that of uny otiier, ai.d its scope is of a magni tude that will surpass all others and renier comparisons ur.d conttasts Inadequate. It will be unique, a thing entirely apart, sul generis. "It has bten said that the plan of the Fair Is an evolution. In a sense this 19 true. It is tho deielonment of an idea , httussllng to compass the magnitude of an i occasion. The approaching centenary of tho puicnasc 01 tlie 1-ou.slana letritoty irom. the French by the Government of the United states will be an occasion of his toric interest, not only to the citizens of the Territory, but to all the people of the United States, and in Its consequences to all the civilized world." After reciting the history of the move ment to celebrate the one hundredth anni-er-ury of the Purchase, from its Inaugu ration as a mere local ceremony, tq the crowning idea of an international exposi tion, the historical significance of the trans action between France and the United States, the writer, pas.s to the financial sinews provided for the consummation of tho H:ui as a World's Fair. He says: llovr the .Money Wan liaised. "The necessary money has1 been raised U0,(f4.(u9 by tlie municipality and citizens of the city of St. L-u:s, JLOoj.OCO by the State of Missouri.

There have b.en other fairs that hate attracted attention of the world and which will lie in history for the magnitude of their plans, the perfectijn of their details nnd the wondirs of their ex hibits. Tlie task of the managers of the St. Louis World's Tair is to eclipse all former efforts In the way cf exposition creations. I believe they w'ill accomplish It. They have no record of failure in business en terprise or civic accomplishment. They are devoting their valuable time, at the sacrifice of enormous business Interests, to this labor of love, without compensation. Cenerulit; of the Plan. "The scheme of the Exrosltion is a radical denarture from that of any other. The ex positions that have preceded havo iabrred mainly for the display of products illus trating the achievements of manufactures and arts, and the resources of agriculture, horticulture, mining and other branches, with attractions Incidental to all ihows of extensive range. Our scheme comprises an exposition of processes things in .iction applied energy. It is proposed to Enow not merely finished products, but what Is far more Interesting, how they ara produced. This means. In manufactures, the entire evolution of the crude material in its prog ress to the ultimate product; in tho liberal arts, the visible growth of things, under the manipulation of appliances, into forms of lyauty nnd usefulness; In the sciences, the gradual but sure approaches to actual accomplishment; and so on to the end. h. primary purpose being to enlighten and educate as well as to pleaso the co and entertain tne physical senses. Speaking of the material and physical features of the Exposition, the writer says: "Forest Park, the site of the Exposition. Is not excilled In natural beauty by any pub lic park in the United States, and is sur passed by few in the world, and its adap tation to our purposes is well-nigh perfect. About 1.V0O acrc3 will be utilized. It h, iut a plain. The topography Is rolling, with hills, valleys, water courses, meadowy reach's and groves of forest trees. The architectural features will be adapted to the natural conditions as far as practica ble, with an eye to harmony and systematic requirements, the enllro scheme being a series of pictures, perfect Individuality, and consistent and harmonious as a whole. Available Area I Kreat. "As our available- area Is greater than that of any other fair, so will our build ings be of cortesponfling magnitude and cirtctiveness of perscpcctlve, a wonder of architectural skill, -vastness and complete ness. "It is scarcely necessary to say that the essential details for personal comfort and convenience, too often neglected, are en-Lin-'lr.ir the special study of our architects and mechanics. There will be moving side walks and stairways and elevated railways, and. so far as ingenuity and invention can devise, physical fatigue for the visitor will be eliminated. In conclusion, I will say that, in view of the consequence of the United States among the nations of the earth, brought to uni versal attention by the recent performances of our arms and the development of our commercial area, and in view of the fact that the eves of tho world are upon us and that all peoples desire to know- us bettec and to """ what manner of men they are who constitute this miracle of Itepublics, we are animated by a patriotic determina tion to aert. in this Exposition, the verity cf our greatness and to vinuicaie our ran. The WorM'tf Fair, therefore, cannot tie lo calized. It is cosmopolitan and stands for the whole country, and expect1 the sub stantial sympathy of every American." GRAU COMPANY STARTS EAST.

Eeturns From Washington Satis fied That Bovd Will Xot Suc ceed Smith as Surveyor. Louis P. Aloe, a member of the delega tion of St, Louis Republicans who went to Washington to confer with President Roose velt with regard to the Kerens-Hitchcock fight, returned home last night seemingly ratijfled with the audience granted by the President. Mr. Alee Is confident that Kerens will win out over bis opponents, despite all that ha3 been said to the contrary. Kerens's enem!e3, he said, had done their work, and now Kerens bad Just commenced to show his hand. The worst thing that Mr. Aloe looks for Is the appointment of a neutral candidate. Even that, he argues. ou!d not show a, defeat of Mr. Kerens, but an effort on the part of the President to pacify all of the factions. Concerning the situation Mr. Aloe aid; "The appointment will cot be made b fore tne middle of next week, and possibly later. In view of the fact that tho Aklns iorce nave conaiaitniiy aoa rauai positively claimed the appointment of Mr. Bovd, we are confident of success, as we are equally as positive thut Mr. Boyd will not be ap pointed. A failure of the opposition to se cure Bojd will be regarded by the Kerens forces as a victory. It Is admitted, even by Secretary Hitchcock, that Smith's record as Surveyor is good. Reports on file in the Treasury Department by three special In- j cpectors sent from Washington to Investi gate the Surveyors olf.ee, cemmend Mr. Smith highly. There are no charges against Jura, even by the opposition. It is dliflcult, therefore, to understand from the stand point of civil service efficiency, of which President Roosevelt is such a strong expo nent, on what grounds Mr. Smith should be removed. "Nathan Frank had a satisfactory Inter view with the President on Monday In be half of the Kerens side of the controversy. On Tuesday Representative Amlck of St. Joseph and myself had an Interview with the President. After discussing the matter for about Ave minutes, we told the Presi dent that we wished to be heard at length, and he kindly and courteously gave u a special appointment for the next day. Wednesday at 12:30 o'clock we called again, and the President invited us to re main until he was through with all other callers. "Many mttters which had previoulv- been misrepresented to him were discussed. The , President argued that, as he supported and ( recognized the Republican Congressman of Delaware he thought his action should be the same in Missouri. J "I answered by stating that Mr. Joy rep-' resented a personal grievance of long standing against Kerens and Smith, and that Mr. Eartholdt wa3 induced to join th.: forces against Kerens because he thought that was the way the wind was blowing, and he did not represent the wishes of the organization in St. Louis by so doing. "The name of Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock was not mentioned either by ths Preeldent or ourselves In any manner. Tne President as-urel us that ho had made no promises and had not yet made up hfa mind nor was he yet ready to do so; that he felt disposed to turn down both faction.-, but thut he had not even decided to do that. "We then retired, 8 In the anteroom I met Messrs. Kalbfell and Owen, delegates' to the last National Convention, who had Just arrived, and were seeking an audience with the President In behalf of Mr. Kerens. I Introduced them to Mr. Loeb, private sec retary to the President, who made an en gagement for them for the next day Thursday."
