The Noligh Advocate has boon ab sorbed by the Loader of that town and now there will bo but two papers thoro. -AJfow years ago the town was afllioted with four papers. The unmbor is now reduced to about tlio proper size one republican and a fusion publication. The city of Omaha appears to bo hav ing more trouble with squatters than the average laud official of a newly opened reservation. The people there appear to consider it their right to build houses in the streets or any old part of the oity not already occupied with dwellings. An insight into Japan's progress from a Boml-clvilized nation to a place among the loading nations of the earth may bo gleaned from the Knowledge that since 1871 the country has built nearly 80,000 elementary schools providing for the accommodation of 4,000,000 pupils , one- fourth of whom uro girls. " Quo mining district in Colorado is producing gold at the rate of $30,000,000 a year. The mineral wealth * of tbo country is strong backer of the treasury and general business conditions. There is no danger of Uncle Sam going bank rupt as long as his mines continue to produce wealth at this rate. Dooley says : "Th1 diff'renco between an American joke an' an English joke is th' place to laugh. " The trouble in getting thorn appreciated by both peoples is that the Englishman cannot discover the place to laugh in an American joke and the American experiences the same difficulty with the English article. Land values in this part of the state are up and rising and the demand is good. It is probable that more land in this vicinity has changed hands this year than in several preceding years. The transfers are an eloquent tribute to the fact that realty is coming into the position it has been destined to occupy. Colorado's swing toward the republi can party is giving great encourage ment to the residents of that state , and will advance the value of its property and add greatly to its prosperity. A re publican majority in any state is always a flue advertisement of its people's progressiveness - grossivoness and intelligence. St. Louis Globe -Democrat. The democrats are again employing much ppuco in the papnra in urging tar- Ill' roforniH , Their representation of ohoitpor iirticloH of consumption IH quite captivating but thuro uro many who will romoinlwr that ohoupwm and good I ilium are not boon companions. The limn who volet ) for clump goods of utiotluir'H make also votes for a cheap- ing of hln product. The Columbus Telugram calls Hill "the moummt traitor" in the democratic party's history and yet Hill has many friends , It IH a peculiar way of har monising the party factions , but it limy prove a winner , Perhaps a man needs to bo called a traitor to win himself and friends over to the support of the ticket , especially when that man is prominently mentioned as a candidate for president , The refusal of OoiiKroBsmon Stark and Neville io enter the democratic caucus atlWashlngton is probably the llrst ofllotal declaration of independence of the people's independent party nlnoo the fusion combine

Now It Is rumored that Queen Wil- holmtna of Holland will sue her hus band , Duke Henry of Mecklonborg- Schworln , for divorce on the grounds of cruelty and improper behavior , Public Rimtimunl IH intonnoly with thn queen.

The cashier of an alcohol distilling plant at Buda Pesth , Hungary , took a novel way of getting ovou with his em ployer who had discharged him. Ho throw hlniHolf into a 200,000 gallon tank of spirits and was drowned. The manu facturer was compelled to sacrifice the contents of the vat as it could not bo used for drinking purposes. The owner was almost bankrupted and the employe must have had a glorious drunk before ho died. There are ways and ways of getting oven. It is generally considered that Ken tucky , Virginia and South Carolina are the loading tobacco producing states of the union but Missouri has just shown them that they are not in it. Missouri's production of manufactured tobacco last year was more than that of any other state in the union , over 78,000,000 pounds passing through Its factories. That la moro than a pound for every man , woman and child in the United States and therefore evidence that some- ouo uses the wood. The World-Herald thinks that if the fusion congressmen had the patronage of Nebraska they would recommend f u- slonists , and consequently good men , to the position of postmasters in Nebraska. It may bo policy for the "World Herald to insist that all democrats are good and all republicans bad , but it doesn't ap pear to bo n winning policy. To fusionists - ists it is empty flattery and to republi cans it sounds silly and cheap. The sin cere man will admit that there are good and trno mon in both parties. The Columbus Telegram wants Ne braska to maintain Its place as dictator of domocmtio party principles and doesn't believe that David Bennett Hill is the man upon whom Nebraska demo crats can nuito ; therefore , after consult ing with a number of leading men of the party , it brings out the name of Ad miral Winfllod Scott Schley as the ideal candidate and one on whom all could unite with credit to the party and the state. The Telegram is in close touch with Mr. Bryan and It is probable that it but voices the sentiment of the defeated - foatod loader who hopes for a candidate who will support what ho considers the democratic principles. THE NEWS has received n recent in dustrial edition of the Hnbbard county , Minnesota , Enterprise , published in Park Rapids by Henry R. Cobb , at one time city editor of THE NEWS. Mr. Oobb has recently acquired ownership of the plant and the recent edition indi cates that ho is peculiarly fitted for get ting out attractive editions. The mat- tor'ls excellent , the illustrations fine and the press and typographical work of high grade. A section of the edition that is particularly attractive is under the hood "Recreation and Sport" which is illustrated with some fine hunting scenes and a number of views illustra tive of a picturesque country. An exchange intimates that the country is anxious to got cheap sugar. Of course I Americans are human. They tiosiro to buy what they consume as cheaply as possible and cell what i Mmy produce at thn host , possible price. The fanners tire un.xl UH for cheap mignr , nlump lumber , cncap wlro and iiuiln , olu > up clothing , cheap fiH , cheap machinery and nil products of Unit char acter ; at the HIUUO tiiiui tlmy would like good prlctm for ciittlo , hugs , hay , grain , etc. The mci'hunio and laboring man whoso wages are high , according to the price at which Ills product is nul ling , Hhould dcsiro that bin omployiTS get. good prices. Atthnwiuio time ho would welcome the advent of cheiip flour , cheap moat , cheap wool , cheap shoes , cheap furniture and cheap rent. Therefore the economist who can form ulate a system that will make things cheap for the consumer and high for the producer will find that ho has a largo constituency , But until this can bo done it is doubtful if many people will insist on an era of cheapness such as was experienced during Cleveland's ad- ministration. No such pronounced general prosperity has over boon known In the country OH now prevails under an era of high prices and it is doubtful if the ( people would accept a ohango to cheapness and calamity. If it is fair that sugar should bo cheapened by male- In-g it impossible for the American beet and cano sugar interests to thrive it is likewise fair that other products should bo cheapened , and when once legislation begins to cheapen articles and products it is a question to decide when and whuro to stop. If cheap sugar is desired it is just iw curtain that cheap flour , cheap meat and ether cheap articles ot general consumption would bo wel comed. A HlroiuioiiH President RooHovolt's mocHago to con gress is satisfactory and fully up to what has boon anticipated. These who have followed the man through his pub lic career have noted that ho is daunted by no emergency ; that ho is fearless and impartial ; that ho has pronounced convictions and does not hesitate to ex press them for fear it may not bo politic to do so. They recognize that ho is a man to grasp a situation and deal with It according to his best judgement , and are pleased to notice that these charac teristics have not deserted him at a time when most needed , when a nation awaits with unusual Interest to learn what ho recommends as the country's policy and they have not boon disap pointed. Ho handles important ques tions with vigor and with condor. There is no public American that the term so well fits and to whom it is hns been moro frequently applied than has strenuous in referring to President Koosovolt , and this quality is breathed through his message from introduction to signature. Questions of vital import are discussed in a manner to indicate that the president would sooner err than evade , and through all is the evi dence of a well balanced mind and sound business judgement. There are these who have feared the president's impetuosity , that his quickness at reaching - ing a conclusion indicated a lack of depth and reasoning powor.bnt themes- sago will convince them of their error. Ho may roach a decision on important matters quickly but the evidouco is there that ho is unerring ; that when ho attains a decision it is permanent and that ho is generally right. Ho makes a strong and sousiblo argu ment against anarchy and recommends measures for its suppression which , if joined in by ether nations having more to fear from that people than have the Americans , will undoubtedly result in the discouragement and overthrow of the debased and dishonorable teaching. Ho deals with the trust question in a broad-minded manner , which plainly points out that all commercial evils may bo in trusts but not all trusts are commercial evils. His recommendation that congress should pass a federal law having jurisdiction of trusts as the gov ernment now has jurisdiction over na tional banks and affording publicity is splendid and would undoubtedly over come the present prejudices against all forms of capitalization and combina tion. tion.Tho The president rightly looks upon labor and agriculture aa the foundation for national prosperity and growth and recommends that these classes bo given every encouragement , and protection from all influences that would tend to lesson their importance. The executive speaks for the presova- tlon of forests , for the promotion of ir rigation and for additional national parks whore the lovliness of nature and its children may bo preserved from en croaching and commercial civilization. The questions concerning the Island possessions , while touched upon briefly , are handled very thoroughly and judi ciously. Ho upholds the Monroe doc trine : favors the isthmian canal j wants the navy enlarged and the merchant marine encouraged ; speaks in favor of expositions , upholds the merit system and discusses other important matters in a manner to indicate that ho is a progressive American citizen with the welfare of his country and the people at heart. His advice to congress is sound and if that body will follow his sugges tions there is no question but that the country will rapidly advance and that it will continue to hold the first place among the leading nations of the earth. The message , unlike many that have boon issued , is interesting reading and every loyal American citizen should familiarize himself with its contents. A pralrlo flro Is reported from Sparks , thin Mate. The village board Hhould put a Hpark-arrestor over the town. "do way back and Hit down" has al ready Hoen its llnish In popular estoom. U is now being UHod by putont medioinu adveriiHorH. An English duke has recently mar- rled a Miss Pooro. It is probably Hafo to coiiHidor that her name does not indi cate the size of her bunk account. President Roosevelt couldn't resist the opportunity of giving the demagogues a slight rap along with the anarchists and other disturbers of the nation's peace. The democratic state central committee - too at a recent mooting officially buried the free silver issue , and there wore few mourners. The issue has been dead so long that the delay over the funeral ob- Boquios was inexcusable. The people of Fort Dodge , Iowa , are experiencing a mad dog scare and the mayor of the city has ordered all dogs muzzled for a period of two weeks. It is out of soaaon for rabies but Iowa is not daunted by fitness when excitement is wanted American eyes are centered on Wash ington , where the greatest law-making body in the world in in session. It will undoubtedly pass upon many measures and the people will hope that the wel fare of the country will always bo the supreme consideration. The Wayne Republican is much im proved , typographically and the matter it contains since Dennis ' , O'Leary as sumed the management of the plant. Mr. O'Loary is a good newspaper man and the people of Wayne are evidently cognizant of his ability. There are several things that the state administration cannot remove from north Nebraska. Two of these are its soil and climate and with these to build from the north half of the state may en joy a certain degree of prosperity re gardless of the machinations of Gov ernor Savage and his aids. A Now York court has ordered a woman who sued a newspaper for libel to pay $500 to the newspaper for mak ing a defense after the paper had proved its case. A few examples like this would have a wholesome effect on the people who choose to consider them selves libeled when in reality they have no character or business to libel. David B. Henderson of Iowa has again been honored by being elected speaker of the national house of repre sentatives. Mr. Henderson has appar ently demonstrated his ability to pre side over and govern this turbulent body of law makers to their satisfaction. It is a trying position and the endorse ment by his associates is most compli mentary to the Iowa man. The World-Herald has honored Presi dent Roosevelt's message with a fair and impartial criticism that , instead of detracting from that paper's position as the leading fusion organ of Nebraska , has given it prestige In the state with all classes of politicians. It has dropped partisanship for the nonce and given its views of the document as a disinterested critic. It is a profound relief to see the paper thus discuss the message and shows n disposition to fairness that has not heretofore characterized its editorial page. page.With With President Roosevelt and the stockmen urging irrigation in the west and with the many backers they have throughout the west , it is quite probable that congress will see the necessity of ilolug something along this line at the present session. It is certain that no greater step toward upbuilding a great part of the country was never under taken than this and if n practicable measure is adopted the country will ad- ranco to a position beyond that of the most optimistic dreamer. With the millions of acres , now idle for want of water , placed in qondition to produce 3rops and food stock the permanent prosperity of the west will bo assured * nd the entire country will bo benefited. A number of exchanges are printing what purports to bo a soliloquy on the free raw sugar question entitled "Whor Dow I Cum In ? " The most obtuse reader will see in the poem the artistic liand of Havemeyor's refining trust In the attitude of a farmer pleading for ohoap sugar. If it was for free sugar with- outthat word "raw"in it.the production would sound bettor , but the average farmer , especially the one who is rais ing sugar beets , is not worrying very much about the income of Mr. Have- meyer's trust and will not exert himself to glvo that corporation on additional Income and an opportunity for supreme control of the sugar market. The re cent dropping of price to injure the beet industry and then raising it to a point higher than before the drop is but a sample of what the trust is capable of doing. After North Nebraska. It appears as though the counties of north Nebraska will bo compelled to en ter an alliance , offensive and defensive , in order to got and keep anything be longing to the state. The officials , in fluenced by the pushers of the south Platte country , are determined to re move the only state institution with which thu north half of the wtuto ban buon honored , the Norfolk hospital for the insane , which wns only si-oured by thu puymont of a handsome bonus by the people of Norfolk and throtiKh the untiring energy of its friondst. In ac cepting the Norfolk bonus an agreement was entered into that the hospital should be a pornmnont institution hero and thu removal of the patients IB a virtual breaking of such agreement on the part of the state , bocaiiHU a hospital building without patients is not a hospital. The officials of the hospital and the citizens of Norfolk have exerted themselves to provide for the comfort and convenience of the patients remaining hero BO that they considered the unfortunates wore as well or bettor cared for than before and in muchjbotter circumstances than they would bo in-tho overcrowded hos pitals at Lincoln and Hastings. If Gov ernor Savage and his friends were so de termined to save expense , why didn't they remove the patients immediately after theiflro and save the unnecessary oxpouso of providing temporary quar ters ? The governor's grand stand play would then have bad a much better ap pearance to the people of the state at largo. Now thoyjcomo with a sop of a state normal school , thinking that thereby they will bo able to satisfy the outraged people of Norfolk and north Nebraska , and that they may remove the hospital without a protest. In the first place Norfolk is not in the field for a normal school. It is interested in retaining the institution already established hero. If it had wanted a normal school in its stead the people would have said so. Then there is a question of the adminis tration's ability to deliver the goods if the proposition was satisfactory. The manner injwhich it has been losing the respect and confidence of the people throughout the state causes the people to believe that it can offer nothing not under the control of these officials now occupying the state house in fact it is a grave question whether they can re tain the positions they now occupy if the people are once given an opportunity to speak on the subject. When Nor folk or other towns in north Nebraska want a normal school they will say so. At present they are concerned about the unfortunates of this part of the state and their families. In line with this evident attempt to get even with north Nebraska for some real or imaginary wrong or to keep all honors in the south Platte country for the monetary or other bene fit that section will derive , is the hint recently given in the State Journal that T. L. Norval , retiring from the supreme jndgeship , is to bo given the place of court commissioner hold by Judge Sedg- wick. This is the position with which the name of Judge Barnes of this city was prominently connected before elec tion. But it now appears that this was merely held out to catch Mr. Barnes' support , who was prominent before the state convention as a candidate for the supreme judgeship. The Journal and its friends may not be able to take the position away from Judge Barnes and deliver it to Judge Norval , but it is evi dent that it would if it could and is working in that direction. The people of the north half of the state should awaken to their interests and assert themselves in no uncertain manner , or all the prestige possible will bo taken from it. It can wield a power ful influence if it will , and the time has como when it should be emphatically demonstrated to the people of the south Platte that they are not the whole works. 

CALLS IT A BENEFIT. Iowa Railroad Commissioners Are Pleased With Consolidation. Dos Molncs , Dec. 3. The annual re port of the Iowa railroad commission- era , which was made public yester day , after referring to the prevalence of railroad consolidation in the state , comments as follows : "The absorp tion of the smaller lines by the larger ones will bo , on account of the safe guards provided by the railroad laws of the state , beneficial rather than otherwise to the people of the stato. It has had the effect not only of plac ing the weaker lines into a higher class , thereby reducing the maximum freight rates , but also of making a continuous mileage rate in case of shipments that , previous to this ab sorption , had to bear the burden of two or more short distance or locoj rates. " Drop In Price of Bar Silver. New York , Dec. 3. The Journal of Commerce says : Bar silver was quot ed In London yesterday at 25 1-16 per ounce. This is the lowest price In about three years , the highest In that period having been reached at 30 3-1C in 1898. During the past week the price has sagged off about a full pen * ny. Inquiry among dealers in sliver tends to show that the decline In the price Is not duo to an Increase in pro duction , but due to a decrease in de mand from continental Europe. Switchmen's Strike Practically Over. Plttsbure , Dec. 3. The strike be gun by the members of the Switch men's union a week ago Is practically over , although the switchmen say that their ranks are holding firm and that none of their men have gone back , while there have been a number of accessions during the week. The strike , however , has failed to tlo up any of the railroads and all lines are now receiving freight , while the yards are being cleared. Great Interest Shown by Mem bers of the House. COMMANDS RAPT ATTENTION. Enthusiastic Members Frequently Applaud ' plaud During the Reading Senate . ' and House Adjourn In Token of Re spect to Late President McKlnley. Washington , Dec. 3. Not in many years have the members of the house listened with such rapt attention to the annual message of a president of the United States as they did yester day to the reading of the first message of President Roosevelt. Every word was followed Intently , from the an nouncement of the tragic death of President MoKlnloy , In the first sen tence , to the expression of the hope that our friendly relations with the world would continue. The reading- occupied two hours , but not a member left their scats until the closo. Sev eral times there was applause and at the close there was an enthusiastic demonstration on the Republican sldo. On motion of Grosvenor ( O. ) that portion of the message relating to the late president WBB referred to a committee composed of one member from each state , to Join a similar committee - mittoo from the senate , to determine by what token of expression It may bo proper for congress to express the deep sensibility of the nation to the tragic death of the late president. The speaker appointed a committee , headed by Mr. Grosvonor , and then , as a further mark of respect the house adjourned. The senate listened to the first mes sage of President Roosevelt yesterday and directed the appointment of a committee to advise with a Hko com mittee of the house , to consider by what token of respect and affection congress might express the sorrow of the nation upon the tragic death of the late President McKinley. The mes sage was delivered soon after the sen ate convened , the reading occupied over two hours and was listened to with great respect by the senators. The first portion dealing with the Buf falo tragedy excited the most pro found Interest In the senate. At the close of the reading Foraker presented the McKlnloy resolution , and as a further mark of respect the senate adjourned. 

TESTIMONY FOR MRS. BONINE. Pistol With Which Shooting Was Done Identified as Ayres' . - Washington , Dec. 3. The case of Mrs. Lola Ida Bonlne , on trial for the murder of James Seymour Ayres , Is expected to go to the jury the latter part of this week. Three witnesses , Intimate friends of Ayres , were tut on the stand yesterday and swore that they had seen a revolver In Ayres' room. They said the revolver greatly resembled the one In evidence. The wrapper worn by Mrs. Bonino on the night of the tragedy was again the subject of discussion , the defense put ting on the stand witnesses whoso evidence was Intended to discredit that given by Dr. Schaeffer , who had testified that a careful examination of the wrapper had failed to dlscloso the presence of any blood spots there on. Maclay Under Fire. Washington , Dec. 3.

Harrison Breaks With Loeffler. Chicago , Dec. 3. Mayor Harrison openly se'vered relations with City Clerk Loofller yesterday , and at the same time set at rest all rumors of a quarrel between himself and Robert B. Burke by declaring that Burke was his friend. This , coming fast upon the lockout of Thomas Gatoan and some 70 delegates to the meeting of the county central Democratic com mittee , Is taken to indicate the may or's enmity for the faction led by ex- Mayor John P. Hopkins , with which Loefller Is affiliated. President Invited to Participate. St Louis , Dec. 3. At a meeting of the committee on ceremonies at World's fair headquarters yesterday a resolution was unanimously adopted providing that President Roosevelt bo Invited to participate In the groundbreaking - breaking ceremonies.
