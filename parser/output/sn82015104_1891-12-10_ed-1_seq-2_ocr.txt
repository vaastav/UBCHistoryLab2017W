The message of President Harrison is presented in full in the Record-U>*io>' this morning. It is a direct, business like, and easily understood document. Except in two divisions, it is not dis tinguished by any brilliancy or especial vigor of treatment, but it is not to be said tbat it is timid. In a time of profound peace, when there is little exciting occupation of the public mind with affairs of .State, and when a condition of quietude anel general content obtains, there is no reason to ex pect in a State document any especial brilliancy or strong appeals to national pride. Tbe messago is very lengthy, and will not, therefore, secure the general reading that all State papers should have. But such is the extent of the country; so greatly have the interests and needs of the nation developed into prominence; so large is the increase of duty in the sev eral departments; so many the questions of public policy tbat bave arisen in the last few years, and so extensive the oper ation of the Federal laws and schemes, that we incline to the belief that the day of short Presidential annual messages has gone not to return. Unly mero reference is made to the con clusion of reciprocity treaties. The seal fishery trouble is dismissed with dis claimer tbat our Government has been at all responsible for the delay in adjustment, and with the expression of belief that a I satisfactory basis of arbitration hits been reached. But even under delay that grew vexatious, a provisional closed season was agreed upon, which, we are assured, has greatly lessened the destruction ofthe seals. Upon American inspection, Germany, Austria, Italy, Denmark and France have within the year removed restrictions upon tbo export of American meats to their countries. Equitable trade conces sions have been accorded us by Germany in consideration ot the free importation of sugar. We are at peace with all na tions, and our relations with but two are at all under strain. Tlie New Orleans incident is briefly stated, and Congress is advised to con sider tbe necessity of giving Federal courts jurisdiction over felonious offenses against treaty rights of foreigners elom iciled in tho United States, a recom mendation that is wise, since in any com plications arising out of such offenses the Federal Government must bear the pun ishment and elo the fighting. Chilean insurgents were not recognized as belligerents, says the President, be cause duriug our own rebellion we strenuously protested against similar action by tho Powers of Europe. He de le..ds tbe United States representative in Chile, anel declares that he has been hastily judged by the popular voice. As to the ltata incident, the President justi fies the seizure, and points to the fact that the Chilean Junta itself confessed the er ror of the ship in escaping from Federal control at San Diego, and without de mand hastenetl to announce, that on her arrival in Chilean waters, she would be returned to tho custody of the United Suites. The Federal Court at Los Angeles held that as the insurgents hael not been recog nized as belligerents, 'there was no viola tion ol" neutrality laws by the ltata. From this judgment tbe United States Government appealed, not with any thought of further pursuing the ltata, but in order to bave the question passed upon by tbe higher tribunal, and the law of such cases once lor all settled. The policy of the United States in the j Chilean revolution was that of non-inter- I ference. It recognized the established Government only, but treated tbe revo lutionists with impartiality. No official complaint bas been made against Mr. Egan, and regret is expressed that he should be so hardily criticised. The ! asylum extended Chilean refugees by the I American Minister is defended, and will be maintained until satisfactory guaran tees to the refugees are given. The Baltimore incident is treated with ] vigor. The President means to be under stood as believing that the investigation by the Baltimore's officers developed the truth, and that the assault upon the ship's sailors was deliberate insult to the Amer- ' ican uniform. The United States only waits, and that impatiently, for the ; Chilean court to conclude its investiga- j tiou, when tbe demand for reparation and apology will be renewed, unless it is I especially anel conclusively shown that the Baltimore's crew were blameworthy, which the President does not believe they were. In the rejection of Mr. Blair as United ' States Minister, because he was related to the passage of the Restriction Act, the President declares that China bas made a serious blunder. For the real objection is not against the person, but the law; the j logical result of such excuse for rejection is this, that China may debar any accred ited representative so long as restrictive laws remain against the Chinese upon our statute books. Under such a policy the relations of the countries would be come strained. The country is congratulated upon the increase of the postal service and upon the economy of its administration. Let ter delivery in small cities and towns is approved, and letter delivery in rural parts is suggested on the ground that its absence is an injustice to the farmer, who must come considerable distances and j stand in line at a general delivery win- j dow, or rent a box, while the townman I toasts his toes at home and has his mail i delivered by his side. Concerning the ocean mail service, it is confessed that I efforts to place it upon American bottoms have practically failed. But we are told that this is no reason for discouragement. What the Government asks by its bids for service calls for 510,000,000 expendi ture in American ship-yards. That will \ be made, and speedily, and if we are faithful to our present offers of compen sation for the ocean mail service, it will not be long before success will be achieved, a renewal of American ship ping be secured, and recovery had of a fair share of the carrying trade of the world. In all which the sentiment of the people of tbe Nation runs with the expression ofthe Chief Executive. The building of the navy is referred to j extendedly, and with a glow of pride, i and the forecast made that Aery soon we I will have strength sufficient to protect ! our people in all lands bordering upon oceans, and to maintain the honor of our hag in all seas. Indian affairs are treated dispassion- \ ately and Congress is urged to continue j friendly to the educational system that i 

SACRAMENTO DAILY RECOKP-UyiOy. THITTISDAY, DECEMBEK 10, 1891.— SIX PAGES. is now 90 potent in solvfn; ''ie Indian) question. Supplemental to it is enlist ment of Indians in tin* army, which has ; been thus far a pronounced success; the j grant of lands to Indians in severalty j rather than to tribes, and the narrowing Of 8m reservations and return of surplus j lands to the public domain. He inti- I mates that it would be wise to admit In- ! dians to citizenship, giving them the pro- i tection, while holding over them the pen- ; alties of the law. Ho considers it also an ! anomaly that five civilized tribes in the Indian Territory should have no other than treaty relations with the United States, and no representation save in the lobby. He predicts that a change of these conditions is as inevitable as it should be just, when made—in which we take it no unbiased mind, well-informed upon the subject, will take issue with President Harrison. The President defends the tariff policy of his administration with warmth, cit ing "the general prosperity," increase of import and export trade, and the absence of prophesied distress, as an indication of its wisdom. But this branch of the mes sage must, of necessity, be treated inde pendently if criticism of it is to be clear and strong. So urgent is the President that tho Nicaragua Canal shall be pushed to com pletion, and so great are the benefits to us he recites to flow from it, that he advises Congress to conaentto extend its builders aid by guaranteeing its bonds, but under conditions that would secure the I'nited States control and against all possible loss. I'pon the silver question he is em phatic in his opposition to free coinage. He gives, however, no comfort to any opposition to the present policy, and wishes it to continue on trial. This por tion of the message must be independ ently treated and the argumentative pas- \ sages considered in their order. He warns the country that, while as a rule the Jewish people do not become de pentleuts nor public charges, und are in dustrious and frugal, to project a vast number of them into the I'nitcd States who arc now refugees from Russia, will! be neither good for them nor for us. The Lnited States < 'overnment hns interested itself with "Itussia, with which it has so lung had close friendly relations, to tc lieve the Jewish Russians from reported cruelties and oppressions. The new Department of Agriculture is approved and commended, and the civil service reform defended, but rather too tenderly to satisfy the ardent friends of the reform. The Census Bureau comes in for emphatic approval, and the result ot its work is compared with that of its predecessor to the discredit of the hitter. A Federal irrigation policy is advocated ! that will enable the territorial areas need- ■ ing to marry the water and the laud, to j avail to the fullest extent of the natural water sources and supplies under control i of the Government. The President insists i that the Government should part with j none of these sources and supplies, and permit of no infringement of them, ex- j eept upon terms and conditions that will j insure settlers proper water supply on equal and reasonable terms, iv which the Chief Magistrate reflects the best-in formed sentiment and the most intelli gent judgment of the country. Utah is lolel that it must not hope for Statehood until beyond all manner of doubt the people are purged of all polyg amous sentiment. Considerable stress is laid upon the need of legislation to com pel all railroads to use air-brakes anel au tomatic couplers. The condition of the army is reported to be gratifying, the per cent* of desertions rapidly falling, and the character of enlistments as rapidty ! rising. Work upon securing coast de- j fense sites, and in promoting the manu- j facture of heavy ordnance, is progressing I satisfactorily. Coming down tothe method of appoint- I ing Presidential electors, President Harri- ! son grows eloquent in his earnest protest against the gerrymander that underlies all propositions to select Presidential j electors by districts, and to break down ! the method of choosing by general vote. He declares with patriotic emphasis that the chief danger to a republican form of government to-day resides in the scheme of partisan jugglery that proposes to abandon the general majority system of choosing electors. The State of Michigan in this Presidential criticism comes in for deserved and vigorous reproof. The Chinese Exclusion Act, the Presi dent believes, has accomplished its end by closing the American doors, but.those of Canada and British Colombia are still open. The late decision of a court, turn ing* hinese back across the Canadian border, negatives the law, and renders attempts to enforce it upon the foreign boundary farcical. In the protection of the voter in his right to cast a ballot un intimidated and free from cow, the Presi dent reopens the debate that the Lodge election bill inaugurated. He travels over the ground in favor of such legisla tion, and urges with eloquent force upon Congress the aeloption of such measures as will make good the guarantee of the law to tho voter when attempting to ex ercise his right to vote to fill a Federal oilico. His advice to Congress is to authorize tbe Supreme Court to name a commission to examino into the whole question of free suffrage and to report means to secure every elector in his right to freely vote for national officers, aud to prevent all limitations of suffrage except those found in the law. These remarks will serve as an index to the chief features of the message, most of which we reserve lor independent criticism. The Record-Union acknowledges the courtesy of the Western L'nion Telegraph Company in presenting it with the full telegraphic text of the President's mes sage. It was a handsome compliment to this journal, which is thoroughly appre ciated.
