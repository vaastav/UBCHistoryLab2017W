The river and harbor improvements have been carried forv ard with energy and econ omy, though many are only partially com pleted. The results havo s&vtd to com merce many limes the amount expended. The increase of commerce with greater depth of channels, greater kecurity in navi gation, and the saving of time, add much to the wealth of the country, and incicasce the resources of theGi. . rvment. The bridge across il " VisisMppi river a' Itock Island has been n li.pk ted, and the proper kite has been determined upon for the bridge at LnCrosse. The able and exhaustive report made by the Commission appointed to investigate the Sutro I uunel has been transmitted M Congress. The observation and repoits of the ISigu.il Office have been continued. Stations have been ma.ntaiued at each of the principal lake, seaport, and river cities. Ten audi tional stations have been established in the United States, and arrangements have been made lor an exchange of reports with Can ada, and a similar exchange of observation is contemplated with the West India Islands. The favorable attention of Congress is in vited to the lollowiug recommendations of the Secretary ol War; A discontinuance of the appointment of extra Lieutenants to serve as Adjutants rnd Quartermasters ; the adoption of a code providing a specific pen alty for well-defined ofiences, so that the ir regularity of scutencis adjudged by court martial may be adjusted ; the consolidation of accounts under which expenditures nre made, as a measure of economy ; a reap propriation of the money for ihe construc tion of a depot at Ban Antonio, the title to the site being now perlecud ; a special net placing the cemetery at the City of Mexico on the same bsis as other lAtional cemeter ies; authority to purchase Bites lor military posts in Texas; the appointment of -commli-sary sergeants from non-commissioned offi cers, as a measure fur securing Ine bcttc, care and protection of supplies; au appro priation lor ihe catalogues and tables of the anatomical section of the army medical inv scum : a reappropriation of ihe amount i'... the iimnulucture ol breech-loading urir should ihe Hi-Ieition be c- Cm. id oy tne Hoard of Uflker.-. to ) i.)ruui up- propriations unexpeU'' i close of the fiscal year; th kale n. xu ah.

The attention of Congriss will be called, during its present session, t,, various ent'.i-pris-es lor the more nrluin and cheuj er transportation ol the constantly increasing surplus ol the Western and Southern pro ducts to the Atlantic sra border.

Second and third new routes will be pro poned for Ihe consideration of Congress, namely, by un extension of the Kanawha and James Hirer Cannl to the Ohio, and by the exten.-ion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. I am not prepared to recrminend Govern me nt aid to thise or other tutei prises, until it is cletuly shown that they are not only ol national interest, but that when complete el they will be of a value ce inmiiisuiate with their cos. That the production increases more rupidly than the me ans of transporta tion in our country has been demonstrated by past experience. That the unprecedented giowth in the population and products of tl:i! whole country will require: additional facili ties and cheaper iiv-ans lor the more bulky article s of commerce to reach tide water and a mtuket, will be tit manned In the mar 1 i lure, ii equally demons' ruble. 1 w en Id, there fore, Migcst a committee or commi sion to be nuihoiized t- consider the whole question, anil to n port to Congress at sonx luttire day l"r lis belter guhlaiit:e in legi.-Ia-ting on the impMtanl st.liji c t.

Looking to tin- great luture ol the country, the ine.molng do lhauds ofromme rce, it might be: we II, while on this subject, not only lo liuvc exumlM il and report upon the various pnnlii ullu mutes lor connecting lh Mhsissipd with J hi tide water on the Atlantic, but the h ash billty of un almos.t e emtlnuoiiH hind loi.knl navigation from Maine to the Gulf or Mexi co. Such a route along our coast would hi; of great valei. ai all times, and ot iiii-stlma-ahle value in case of a foreign war Nature lias provide d the greater part of this route and the obstacles to be overcome are ensilt within the skill of the engineer. I hs.ve not alluded to this subject with the view of having any further expenditure of public money ut this time than may be nec-e-tury to procure and place all the necessary inf irmation before Congress in an authentic lotm to enahl,. it hereafter, if deemed prac ticable and worthy, to legislate on the sub ject without uelav. The report of the be cretary of the Navy, herewith accompanying, explain fully the condition of that branch of the public ser vice, its w anti and deflciences, expenses In curred during the past year, and appropria tions for the same. It also gives a complete? history of the service s of the Navy for the past year in addition to its regular services, it is evident that unless steps are taken to preserve our navy, tbnt lu a very lew years the United States iv ill be the weakest nation rpon the ocean, of all the great powers. Woii an riicrzetif. progressive people like ours, penetrating and forming business re-laMro-w with every part of the known world, n ' .vy strong enomdi to command the re spect of our flag abroad is necessary for the ull protection f their rights. I recommend care-rul consideration by Congress ot the recommendations made by the Secretary of the Navy. The accompanying report of the Post master General furnishes a full and satisfac tory exhibit of the operations of the Post Ollice Department during the year. The ordinary revenues of the department for the cr.l year fueling June b'0, 1872, amounted $ 21,5)1.3.450 37, and the expenditures 26, f "18,192 21 Compareu with the previous fiscal year, the increase of revenue was 1,-118,380-9.3, or 9.37 per cent, and the increase of expenditures, $2,268,088.23, or 9.2!) per cent. Adding to the ordinary revenues the nnual appropriation of $700,000 for free niatterand the amounts paid to the subsidies em mail steamship hues from special ap propriations, the deficiency pale out of the general treasury was $3,317,705.94, an ex cess e.f $3811,700 28 over the deficiency for the year 1S71. Other interesting statistical information relating to our rapidly-extending postal service i tarnished in this rsport. The total b ngih of railroad mail routes on June 30, 1872 was 57,911 miles; 8,077 addi iobiU miles of such service having been put into operation during the year, Eight new lines of railway Post Offices have been es tablished, with an aggregate length of 2,909 miles. The number of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries waa 24,302. 500, an increase of 4,OCO,.302, or 20 per cent, over the number In 1871, and tbe postage thereon amounts to 1,871,257.25. The total vruii:hl of the mails exchanged with Euro pean countries exceeded 820 tons. The cost of the United States trans-Atlantic mail steamship service was $220,301.70. The total cost of the United States ocean steam flap service, including the amounts paid to the subsidized lines of mail steamers, was $1,107,020.97. The following are the only steaMshlp lines now receiving subsidies for mail service, under special acts of Con grcss: The Pacific Mall Steamship Com pany re ceive $300,000 per annum for carry ing a monthly nuil between San Francisco, Japan arnl China, which will be increased tn s 1,000,000 pet annum, and a semi month b mail o. uiii alter Oct. 1, ls73.

With respiet lo a iidutiion of rate, and Improved lacilities for postal intercourse, your favorable ceniiidriaiion is respectfully invited to the recommendations made by the postmaster General tor an increase of ser vice from monthly to semi-monthly trirs on t!: mail steamship routt to Urazil ; for a subsidy 111 aid ot the establishment of an American line of mail stenmirs between San Francisco, New Zealand, and Australia; lor the establishment ii post Ofllco saving J inks, and for the increase of tne salaries e l the bead- ol IlnrcauB. I have heretofore comuicceied the abolition e l the franking privilcgc.and know no reason now for chang ing my views on that subject. It not haviLg beenlavorably regard'd by congrcsshowtver I nowsuggest a modification ol that privilege to correct its giaiii.g and costly abuses. I would recommend, also, the appointment ol a Commute e eir Commission to take into consideration the best me tin d, equitable to private corporations w ho have invtstid their luiii- and capital in the- ostablishme ntof tel cgraph line s, of acquiring the title tonllthe tcUgrnph lines imw in otierution. and of e ounce! in.': the ir sen ice w ith the postal bervice: ol ;he nation Jt is not probable that this subject could receive the proper consideration dining the limits of a shoit session of Congnss, but it may be initiated, so that any further action may be fair to tbe Government and to private parties con cerned.

Europe has so much enhanced within the 1 t few years, and the cost of building and op -rating ocean steam era in the United State h is not so much greater than in Europe, hat I believe the lime has arrived for Congiess to take this subject ino serious consideiitiiin. Detailed statements ot tbe disbursements through the Department of Justice will be furnished by t :e report il the Attorney Genera!, and though these hive been some what increased by the recent acts of Con gress to enforce the rights of citizens uf the United Stales to vote in the several States to vote in the several Stutes ot the Union, and to enforce the provisions of the Four teenth Amendment to the Con&lituiioL cf the United States, and the amendments thereto, I cannot question the necessity ana salutary effect of these enactments. Keck less and lawless men, I regret to say, have associated llierase) res together in some localities, to deprive other citizens of the right guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States, and to that end have committed deeds of violence, but the pre vention ajid punishment of many t-f these persons have tended greatly to the repres sion ot such disorders 1 do not doubt that a great majority of the people in all parts nl the country favor the full enjoyment, by all classes of persons, of ihtse rights to which they are entitled untler the Constitu tion and laws, and to invoke, the aid and in fluence of all good citizens to pre vent organ izations whoseobjecis are by unlaw ful means to Interfere with those rigtits. I look with confidence to the time, mn far d.u.i.t, when the obvious advantages of gnesl order and peace will induce an abandonment of all combinations prohibited by the acts reterrea to, and when it will be unnecessary 10 car ry on prosecutions or inflict punishments to protect citnens lor the lawless doings ot such combinations. Applications have been made to me to pardon persons convicted ot a violation of said acts, upon the ground that cemency in such cases would tena to tranqutbzn tho public mind, and to test the virtue m ti ; pc'icy I am disposed, as far a.s my si u se of justice will permit, to give these application? a favorable consideration, but any action thereon is not to be coittrue-das indicating any change in my determination to enforce with vigor such act, so long as the consr ira ctes and combinations therein named disturb the peace of the country. It is much to be regretted, aadis regretted by no uiie more than myself, that a necessity has ever ex isted to execute the enforcement act. No one can desire more than I that the necessi ty of app'.yiugit may never again be de manded.

Efforts will be made in the im mediate future to induce the removal of as many peaceably-disposed Iniansonly to the Indian Territory as can be settled properly, without disturbing the harmony of those al ready there;. There is no other location now available where a pcple who are endeav oring to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and uijncuiturat pnrsuits, can be ns well ac commodated as upou the: unoccupied lauds in the Indian Territory. A Territorial Government should, how ever, protect th Indians from the 11m ail of whites for a term of years, until they be come sufficiently advanced in the arts of civilization to guaid their own rights, and from the disposal ot the lands held by them from tbe tarn.- period.
