Coniu r added that Mr. Frlc.k died "in the midst of what seemed to he sutlxfiictorv Improve ment in his conditions." The sudden passing of Mr. Krli k shocked Wall Ktieot. althoiiKh it had io appreciable ffect on stock values. Vntil the last Mr. Prick retained his interest In business and desplto Ills years had fi criucnth attended direc tors' mcetinirs. il.-frnv bolnir stricken with ntomalne pidsnniiiK he was ac customed to take almost dally exorcise on the coif links at Uo-dyn. The I'i'l public function which ho attended was the dinner kIvoii bcio in honor of Kit s; Albert. Once of the associate of Andrew Carnecin and tlion his tnipllcuble busi ness enemy, this master of finances, who from a farm hand rose In the world to become possessor of a fortune vstlmated at $200,(100,(10" died less than four months after the passing of the "Laird of Sklbo." It Is probable that a larfre part of the. fortune he amassed Viy bulldintr up the greatest coke busi ness in the world .and booomliifr ono of the "steel klnps" will be left to the public. Following announcement to-nighl by Albert H. Ga it. direction head of the Vnlted States Steel Corporation, that -Mr. Prick's costly art collections, with his home In this city, would be left to the public, other friends declared he had fre quently told them Ills children would never he the richest In the wold. He had intimated that allhouch he would make ample provision for them In his will, ho would not leave them his entire wealth. His friends to-day expressed belief that it will be found many millions have been left, to technical educational institution?. Funeral arraiiKemcnts, ho far as they had been arranged to-night provided for a private service at the Filch homo Thursday morning, at which the Rev. Dr. Lelghton Parka, rector of St. iiatholn mew's church, New York city, will of ficiate. The body then will be placed on a special railroad car and taken to Pitts burg for burial Friday The career of Mr. Frick, one of the most fascinating chapters in the history of industrial America, ended without warning at five o'clock this morning, when only Oscar flodgers, the financier's butler, was at his bedside. Awaking Mr. Frick asked for a drink of water and having swallowed it, lay back on his pillow. "I think I will go lo sleep," murmured. These were his last words. Falling in efforts to arouse his master, the butler summoned members of the family, who had retired, not expecting a fatal termina tion to Mr. Frick' illness. Thoho who gathered around the death bed, beside Mrs Frick, were the iron master's daugh ter, .Mies Helen Frick. and his sop and 'daughter-in-law, Mr and Mrs C'hllds Frick. Announcement of Mr Frick's death several hours later brought messages of eondolencw from all parts of the United States. To-night tribute was paid l. Hie men with whom and against whom he had waged financial war. Only tioni Alex ander Berkrnan, tho anarchist, who In the days of the gtcat homestead strike, had attempted to assassinate the finan cier, came a taurn. "It is too had he cannot take the mil lions he amassed by exploiting labor with him," Herkman s-ald in Chicago. The art collection of Henry Clay Frick, with ?Ti6 Fifth avenue home, will "In duo time be turned over to public tir and enjoyment, adequately endowed," It was announced here to-night by Hlbert It, Onry, directing head of the Fnited States Steel corporation and rlosn asfoclate of Mr Frick. In announcing the disposition which would be made of the collection, Mr. Gary said" "Mr. Frick was unusually generous in his benefactions, contributing hundreds of thousands5, and even millions, for the benefit of others, although his liberality was but little known. lie disliked pub licity and abhor! cri o-stentatlnn. "He was a student and lover of ait and by the ufc of patience, thought and large sums of money, he formed one of I lie finest private collections of paintings, statuary, bronzei-, porcelains, enamels, furniture and olhei object" of art in existence, nil, of which under the pro visions, of his testament will in due time be permanently turned over to the public use and enjoyment, together with hi costly horiie In New York, adeiiuately endowed." Although dethioued by Frick as presi dent of the fluted States Steel corpora tion, Charles M Schwab, president of the Rethlehem Steel company. In a statement to-night had only tin. kindest tribute to pay to his one-thlie associate "As a ros-ult of man years of Intimate business association with Mr Frtck. I desire to wry that he hud the soundest Judgnifnt and one of the keenest minds that 1 eve. knew," said Mr. Sehw.fli. "Being eminently fair always and of the highest type of Integrity and homsly. he won n enviable position in the business world which he richly deceived." The career of flenr Clay Frick has formed ono of the mot f.trclnatlng chap ters In the romance of industry In the United States. At ten, a boy on a farm In a family of only oidluary means, lie wa.. at 60, a mon of so many millions that his fortune, like those of Carnegie and Rockefeller, was largely a matter of guess-work even to hims-elf, It has been said he was worth more than ino,OWi,000, perhaps as much as $2iAyi0,00. Mr Frick built up the greatest coke business In tho world, and acquired such vat interests in steel that he was also one of the principal magnates in that Industry, and In rounding nut his carmi ne, became known as one of the world's fi-oatest collectors of master paintings. )' Filck was horn Iieceniher 10.

HENRY G RIG MILLIQNAIK DES named after the maternal grandfather of Mr Frick Abrnm Overhnlt, whose 1 original famllj name was Obcrholtzer, I and who settled in Western Pennsylvania I wnen tnat region wiu regarded as the frontier town of civilization. As the set tlements along the Alleghany and Mo nongnheia grew, and Pittsburgh emerged from Its swaddling elotlies, .Mr. Ovrhol( became the lending miller and distiller of Western Pennsylvania. Ills daughter, Elizabeth, married .lohn W. Frick, a young man of Swiss ancestry, who at the time was working as mi engineer In Hie Overholt distillery. Ii was from this union that the future capitalist was born. The father attempted farming, hut did not make a remarkable success of II and us a iV-sult young Henry Clay I'rirk was practically adopted Into tho overholt family when he was nbottl 12 years old. He received a good I aslc schooling, but there was nuthlim In his boyhood to Indicate the remarkable abil ity which characterized his Inter llf ex cept his eagerness to get Into business. For a time he was bookkeeper ill his grandfather's distillery, and from tills position ho went to Morgan ,v company. cok dcalets anil at about 21 years of age he appeared In Pittsburgh as their agent. The coke industry was in its in fancy. The iron masters of Pittsburgh were Just beginning to appreciate the value of ooke for their furnaces. Young Frick had an opportunlt) to iuVUlre a limited Interest In a plant near Uroadford, and out of the profits of this he acquired other holdings. He later joined a com- j puny to build a railroad lo penetrate the Comiolsvllle coke regluli, and In 1ST!, the e,ir this road was opened, Mr. Frlek i organized the coi potation of Frick Ar com- pan, which bought coal land and ooko ovens In the Connelsvillc region. That was the basis of the Frick fortune. The undivided attention of the rising finan cier was given to coke until 1SS2 in the midst of this period thcie came the pin, of '71 mid the financial crash of mi. ny ambitious operators. At the sheilt'f's sale, Mr. Frick purchased ad ditional tracts of io.il land and ovens, and a few years later t'.ie Motions, pow erful Pittsburg i hankers, became Inter ested In the expanding enterprise of the young operator. Tho Carnegles, then developing their cient steel uslness in Pittsburgh, had taken largo holdings In tho, Frick Cokl company, and In 1SS2 Mr. Frick found the Carnegie brothers willing to admit him as a member of their firm in consideration of IiIr giving them further interests in ills coke business. It was thus Mr. Frick be came also a great manufacturer of steel Through the Homestead strike of 1SP2, Mrfl Frilk enine into national prominence. Differences had arisen between the Carnegie Steel company and its employes over a wage scale, culminating1 In a strike Involving thousands of men: the calling out of the National Guard and the proclama tion of martial law. It was at this period, .Inly 22. 1802. that Alexander rsnrkman, a Now York anaichlst, tried to assassinate Mr. Frick. nerkman walked Into Frick's office, drew u re volver and fired, the bullet lodging in Mr. Frick's neck. Mi. Frick was shot n second time and then he grappled with Herkman. During tho encounter Mr. Frick was stabbed throe times, but lie downed his assailant and hold him until the police arrived. Rerknuui was tried and cunt to tho. Western Penitential y In Pittsburgh for twenty ono years. Thirteen days after Hie attack Mr. Frick walked to his office unattended and resumed tho direction of the great striko which continued until Novmbe. i 21 of that year. Mr. Frick was un moved by the violence, the protests of the public or the distress of the families of the strikers. He won and nver begrudged the price of victory. When Mr. Frtck entered the Carnegie Steel company he decided to make it the moat powerful concern in the steel world. Two of his Immediate ventures netted the Carnegie concern many millions of dol lars without scarcely any Investment. Up to tills time tho switching charges between tho various Carnegie plants had been very profitable to the tailroads and expensive to the Carnegie company. Mr. Frick built the Union railroad to wold the scattered Carnegie plants closer together. This i Unlimited the switching charges and saved enormous sums for the Carnegie company. It was Mr. Frick, who later look over a large portion of the Mesabl ore llelds on Lake Superior in a big deal that guaranteed the Carnegie company for fifty years a minimum annual supply of 1.300.001 tons of ore, driving a sluewd bargain with the Kockefellers who owned these ore lands. Later Mr Frick conceived the proposi tion of buying out Mr. Carnegie entirely, and in association with Henry Phipps, tho second laigest owner, of stocks, and with the co-operation of 12. H. Moore and others, Mr. Frick asked Mr Carnegie for an option on his intettsts. Mr. Car negie demanded $l,(i0n,(i0 for a M-day option and named 157,9."fl,iH)0 in cash and bonds for his entire holding This price with the additional cost of the stocl: of the other partners in the Carnegio com pany brought the cost of Mr. Frick's scheme close to iv,ooo,000. Tho matter was taken in ,1. P .Morgan, who was not impresod with the idea. The plan collapsed. Mi Frick's option expiring at a cosi of ,i million dollars which Mr. Carnegie poi iioted. This was tile first failure Mr Frick had ever known, but it was also a blow to Mi. Carnegie for the failure of the Frick syndicate left him In the position of having been on the market with his holdings which app.ii cntly could not lp(. old Mi. Caniigio became veiy hitler and tried lo oust Mr. Frirk entirely from the steel business They developed a quariel with many ramillrutlons. Mr. C.irnejiio iouglii to have the board of ms lingers ieil.ue .Mr. Frick's stock for feited ut par value. Mr. Frick replied with a suit ttir an injunction to pre vent this conllseatlon of his stock, but the case was flnall settled out of court by the reorganization of the Carnegie compan, which made several Plttsbuig els millionaires over night. It made Mr. Frick one of the wealthiest men In the country, but it was disappointing to him later when Carnegie with the aid of Charles ,M. Schwab succeeded in interest ing Mr. Morgan In the schemo he had prcvloiihly rejected, and out of this In terest cnnie the financing of the l.'nltod States Steel corporation in 1901. lly this again. .Mr. Frick's fortune was doubled. His J.II.(xiO.(ifio Investment in the Carnegie company was turned Into tiil.".fj,(iiO in the Fulled States Steel eni porntion, although Carnegie hod stolen ills thunder. Mr Schwab was made piealdent of the Steel corporation and Mr. Carnegie s repre sentative in that concern. In lMn tlnns became hard and the l'nltod States Steel dropped lo a low lev el. Mr. Frick then bought everything he could in the way of steel stock and whon the excitement was over It was found the had acquired enough to lie a jiowrr In that concern, His first move was to de throne Mr. Schwab as president, but V. K. Coroj, another Carneale innii, sur i ceded Schwab. Then Mr. Frick attacked Corey and succeeded In having hhn re. moved and Mr. Farrell, Frick's friend, was finally made president of the great corporation. Tho breach between Mr. Frick and Mr. Carnegie never fully healed, A small In stance of It was seen in Pittsburgh, where Mr, Carnegie built a Intgn office building, naming It after himself, next door to which Mr. Frick built another building twice as largo and named It after him self. Mr. Frick, Incidentally, became one of the largest holders of rea. estate In Pittsburgh, In New York, Mr. Carnegie built a magnificent home and pome time later Mr, Frick built an even more pain tlal residence on the site of the old t.enox library between 70th nnd Tisl streels on Fifth avenue. 11 was here ihat lie pro vided for a picture gallery which is one of the largest, If not the hugest private gallery In he world. It contains some of the most valuable and famous paintings by Velasquez, lio-mhrundt. Gainsborough and other V'laslers. .Many of theso can viuos are said to have cost Mr. Frick several bundled thousand dollars each. Mr. Frick also maintained n beautiful summer homo at Prides Crossing, Mass. ll was one of the largest owners of Pennsylvania railroad Btock. was one of (hat company's directors, ami Its dom inating factor. He was also a power III Heading, 'llnltlmote Ohio, Norfolk Western nnd otlior iiillroads. On December 15, 1ES1, Mr. Frick was married to Miss Ada Hownrd Chllds nf Pittsburgh. Four children were born to them; two hnjs unit two girls. Mrs. Frick. ono son and one daughter survive. Pittsburg. Pa., Dec. I. Henry Clay Frick was best known to the pcoplo here be cause of his commanding position In tho steel, coal and coke Industries, but to his Intimate friends was known best os the friend of llttln children, His benevolences in their behalf covered a wide area, many of them never reaching the public ear. Occasionally, however, It was necessary In mako them known. 11 was so In the failure of the Pittsburg Hank for Savings which was closed n short time before Christmas n few years ! ago. In this bank had been deposited tho savings of some forty thousand children under plan curried out through the public schools. When Mr. Frick heard of tho failure he promptly offered to make good every loss of the presentation of the claim at another bank of which lie wn a director. His offer was promptly ac cepted, and the children had their money for Christmas. THE

A diversllied lgif lative program to restore a peace time business status, revise the tax system, curb unrest, reduce tho cost of living and rectify labor and farming conditions wna recommended hy Presldont Wilson to-dsy In his message to the now session of Congress The President asked for now tariff laws hascd on the nation's changed relation to the rest of the world, suggested that the luionie and excess profits lax sched ule bo slmplllled, advocated steps to lm prove rural conditions arid promote production, and declared for a "genuine democratization of Industry" to protect both labor and capital. The railroad problem he reserved for .1 future message, and he mnde no state ment of Ids i Mentions regarding the pence treaty or Mexico. Many of his recommendations wcro the samo a.i those submitted to the special session last spring and several of them are embraced In legislation already being formulated In tho two houses, To meet the cost of living the Presi dent asked extension of the. war-timo food control bill, federal regulation of cold storage, readjustment of food transportation, and establishment of a system of federal licensing for all cor porations engaged In Interstate corn met CO. He declared the causes of uniest to Ix -iiporficlal and temporary and made his only reference to the Senate's fail ure to ratify the peace treaty in say ing that restlcssnoss was due largoly to the nation's hesitation in determin ing its peace policy. The federal gov ernment, he declared, should be armed with full authority to deal In the criminal courts with those who pro mote violence. In nn extended discussion of labor con ditions he declared the workers had Just cause for complaint In many matters, and there should he "full recognition of the right of those who work, in what ever rank, to participate, in some organ ic way In every decision that directly affects their welfare." He asserted that the right of Individuals to strike must be held inviolate, but ndded that there must be a firm hand against "tho at tempt by any class to usurp a power that only government Itself has a right to ex ercise as a protection to all." Finally ho suggested the establishment of r trib unal for peaceful decision of industrial disputes. Ife renewed his recommidatlon for a budget system of national flnanpe, asked for special protection to pro mote the dyestuffs and chemical in dustries, and declared the adminis tration bill providing farms for sol diers should be passed without delay. The message, about 5,000 words In length, was transmitted to tho Capitol by messenger, tint President expreas ing regret that his health would not permit 1ns delivery of It In person. It was read separately In Senate and House where it drew mixed expres sions of approbation and disappoint ment. Tho democrats generally praised it as setting forth decisively a prac tical program of reform while on the republican side there were many com plaints that it lacked deflnltenoss and omitted mention of Important problems.
