Stolen yrllli foreign 'pvbicqufiiiuo to1 Ikj tfri'eiidlv. Tho year lias been an eventful one, in wit nessing two great natiotiH, Breaking one luugtuigo anil having one lineage, settling, by peaceful arbitrations, disputes of long standing, and liable, at any timo. to bring those nations into bloody conflicts.! An example" lias thus been set which, if suc cessful in Its ilnal issue, may lie followed by other civilized nations, and be the ilnal means of returning to productive industry millions of men now maintained to settle tho disputes of nations by tho bayonet and broadsword. I transmit herewith a copy of tho treaty alluded to, -which lias been concluded sinco the adjournment of Con gress, with herUritannic Majesty, and a copy 01 inc protocol 01 inc conicrences 01 tho Commissioners by whom it was nego tiated. This treaty provides methods for adiustinir the oucstlons nendlmr between tho two nations. Tho various questions are to bo aujusteu ny arbitrations. THU 

NATIONAL I) Kill' has been reduced to tho extent of eighty Bix millions ilfty-seven thousand one nun died and twenty-six dollars and eighty cents during the year, and by tho negotia tion of national bonds at a lower rate of interest, tho interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that now the hum to be raised for tho interest account is nearly seventeen million dollars less than on tho llnt of March, 18G9. It was hichly de3lrnblc that this rapid dlmunttion should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country ( and convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankruntinc them. Hut in view of the accomplishment of tneso desirable ciiitri anu ot tne rapui de velopment of the resources of tho country, its increasing ability to meet Ianro de mands and the amount already mid, it is not desirable that tho present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment. I therefore recommend n nioditication of both TAlUt'l- AM) 

INTERNAL TAX LAWS, I would rccoiumeud that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those on spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, and tobacco in its various forms from htamps. In readjusting tho tariil' I suggest that a careful cstimato be made of tho amount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providing for tho current expenses of tho government, the interest account, and a sinking fund, and that this as a surplus bo reduced in such manner as to nll'ord the greatest relief to tho greatest number. There are many articles not produced at home, such us medicines and compounded essences, from which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into general iwe. All bitch articles I recommend to be placed on the free list. .Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made on those articles which it can without disturbing homo production or reducing.tho wages of American labor. I have not entered into figures, because to do so would bo to repeat all that is laid before you in tho report of the Secretary of tho Treasury. 

KEVKNUK, COLLECTORS. Tho present laws for collecting revenue pay collectors of customs small salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at the principal ports of entry, particular ly, raise the compensation of these officials to largo sums. It has always seemed to me as If tho system must at times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonent men, should such get posses sion of thofco offices, to bo lax in their scru tiny of goods entered, to enable them finally to make largo seizures. Your at tention is respectfully invited to this sub ject. J'Al'KH AND 

MOLD. Continued fluctuations in the value of gold, as compared with tho national cur rency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of the coun try in keening up prices of all articles nec essary fix cvery-uay life. It fosters a spirit of grumbling, anu the national finances, if tho question can bo met as to how to iret a lixed valuo to our currency, that valuo constantly and uniformlyapproachiug par with specie, a very ucsirauio oujeci win mo gained. THE KUKLUX LAW. There has been imnosed upon tho Exc cutive branch of tho Government tho exe cution of tho act of Congress, approved April 20th. 1871. and commonly known as the Kuklux law. In a portion of the' State oi raouiii unrouna me necessity ot me course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the committee to investigate Southern outrages. Under tho provisions of the abovo act T issued a proclamation calling tho attention of tho people of tho r niteu mates to mo same and declaring my reiuctanco to exercise any ot the ex traordinary powers thereby conferred upon nie excei)tJn,caso of inmeratlvd necessity. by making known my purposo to exercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so for tho purposo of so' curing to all citlzensqf tho United States uio peaceful enjoyment ot the rights guar rauteed to tlfem by tho Constitution and tho laws. After tho passage of this law in- lormation was received from timo ,tt timo that a combination of tho character re ferred to in this law existed and were pow erful in many parts ot the Southern Htates, particularly in certain counties in tho tatato of South Carolina. A careful investigation was made, and it was ascertained that in nine counties of that btato such combinations wero active and powerful, embracing u sufficient por tion oi mo citizens to control uio local au thorities, and having, among other things tho obiect of denrivini' tho cmnnoirmted clas of tho substantial benellts of freedom, and preventing tho freo political action of those citizens who did notsvinpathlzo with their own views. Among their operations wero frequent fccourglngs and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at nlKht bv disguised persons, tho victims in almost all cases being citizens of different political sentiments from their own, or freo perbons who had shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of Inoflensivo and well dis posed citizens wore tho sufferers by this lawless violence. Thereupon, on the ltith of October, Ji71, a proclamation was is sued, in tenns of the law, calling upon tho members ofTlio cofnlnTmibhs to disperse .within live-days, and to deliver to the mar sluil or military nlllcor of thoUnlted States all arms, ammunition,, uniforms, disguls s. ahd other means unii lpipicmetus, used ny them ror carrying out itteir uniawnu pur poses. This warning not having been needed, on tho 17th of October another proclamation was issued suspending tho prlviiegooi tne writ oi naoous corpus in nine counties hi that State. Direct on was iriveti that iwiuiln tho counties so designated persons supposed, upon creditable liuormatmn, to be mem bers of sueh unlawful combinations should bo arrested by tho military forces of the United States ahd delivered to tho Marshal, to bo dealt with according to law. In two of Kald counties York and Spartanburg many arrests have been made. At last accounts the number of persons thus ar rested were one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred, whose crlinltiallty was ascertained to bo of an Inferior degree, were released for tho present. These have generally made Confessions of their guilt. Great caution has been exercised In mak ing test arrests, and, notwithstanding the large number, it js believed that noTnno cent person is now In custody. The prison ers will bo held for regular trial in the Ju dicial tribunals of the United States. As soon as it appeared that the authori ties of tho United States wero about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law. many persons absconded, and there Is good ground for supposing that all such persons have violated tho law. A full report of what has been dono under this law will bo submitted to Congress by the Attorney uenerai. I'OLlTIOAIi DISAlUliITir.S, More than six years having elupsed since the lust hostile gun was fircu be tweon the armies then arrayed against each other onp-jpr tho perpetuation,, and tho other for the destruction of the Union, itt nniv bo well considered- whether it is not time that the disabilities imposed by tho, i'ourteeiuh Amendment should be re moved : that tho amendment does not ex cludo the bullot, but only requires the disa bility to hold ofllea of certain classes, when tho purity of tho b'ailot and secure majorities aro sure to elect olllcors reflect ing the views of tho minority. I do not see tho advantugo or propriety of excluil ing men from ollieo merely. They were belore tho rebellion, men ot standing am character sufficient to lie elected to posi lions requiring them to take an oath to support tho Constitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining tno same viows, but of less standing in their com munities. It may be said the former vio lated an oath, while the latter did not. The latter did not have it in their power to doso. If they had taken this oath it can not be doubted they would have broken it as diil the former class. If there are any reater criminals distinguished abovo all others for tho part they took in opposition to tho Government, thov might, in the judgment of Congress bo excluded from such an amnesty. This subject is sub mitted for your careful consideration. The condition of tho Southern States are, unhappily, not such asali true, patri otic citizens would llko to see. Social os tracism for opinion's cake, personal vio lence or threats towards persons entertain ing political views opposed to those enter tained ly the majority of tlie old citizens prevents Immigration and tho ilow of much needed capital Into tho States lately In rebellion. It will bo u happy condition of tho country when tho old citizens of these States will take an interest in public allidrs and promulgate ideas honestly en tertained, vote lor men representing their views and permit the same freedom of ex pression and ballot in those entertaining dilferent political convictions. CIVIL SKHVICi: REFORM. In my inessago to Congress one year ago, 1 urgently recommended a reform hi tho civil service of tho country in conformity with that recommendation. Congress, in the Dth section of an act making appro priations for sundry civil expensed of the government, and for other purposes, ap proved Marcli ad, 1871, gavo tho necessa ry authority to tho Executive to inaugu rate a civil service reform, and placed upon tho responsibility of doing so under the aut thority of said law. I convened h board of gentlemen eminently qualified, for tho work, to devise rules and regulations to ef fect tho needed reform. Their labors aro not yet complete, but: it is believed that they will succeodiin dcvising.aplan which can bo adapted to the great relief of tho Executive tho heads of dopartmentH and members of Congress, and which will re dound toi tho triio!lintcrest' of the publlo service.
