Speaker Crisp. If there is any signficance in the selection by the Democratic caucus of Crisp for Speaker, it is all With the anti Cleveland contingent. The contest began between the candi dates as men alone, but of late there bae been a political flavor thrown around it. While it is true that some who ere opposed to Cleveland have supported Mills and others who have been friendly to Cleve'and have supported Crisp, still the lines have been fairly well drawn. Sen ator Gorman has ased all his in fluence for Crisp. So has Governor- Senator Hill. On the other harid, j the radical free tiade organs and! Cleveland's warmest friends have j given in their adherence to Mills. I until to a considerable extent the j contest has narrowed down to one | between Cleveland and some other candidate—Hill, for instance—and the victory is thus with the anti-j Cleveland following. There will be explanations and ex- 1 cuses and all th»f, and the Cleve land people will contend that there is no significance politically in the result, but nevertheless the follow ers of David B. Hill will claim the Victory as theirs and will proceed to relegate Cleveland to the fear as a Presidential candidate. It has been a famous fight, and now that it is ended the House will be able to or ganize today and the President's Message will be read probably this week. The new Speaker will be! given all the time'he needs to make j up his committees, and thus having been done the work of the session will begin. It will be interesting to fo'low the proceedings. The House lias thus far taken the advice of Governor Hill. It is his victory If it is any body's ontsidV of Crisp's. He has already laid down a plan of action for Congress to follow. This is to pass bills repealing the McKinley and the Silver acts, and to stop there without any attempt at new legislation on these points. If Hill has his way ami his advice is fol lowed he will become a controlling factor in Washington, and will be able to hold a strong hand in the Presidential game to be play ed at the Democratic National Con vention. The play for position has begun and Hill wins bhe preliminary skirmish.—JFas. Blslne'* True Condition. Dr. J. Malison Taylor gives ft a good account of James (i. Blaine. The physician's lecture of physicial training last night at the Franklin Institute presented an opportunity lor inquiries about that much-talked of visit, when it was stated that the Secretary came 1o this city on pur pose to consult his physician. Because Dr. Taylor when asked about his interview with his late patient spoke, favorably of his health, it was inferred that Mr. Blaine had been undergoing i medical inspect ion at the Stratford, and that he was anxious about his own condi tion and came here on purpose to have a talk with his pdysician. Dr. Taylor, who ought to know, sa> s he diJn't, and that he is free from any organic affection and, in short, as w. II as ever he was in his life. *'ile didn'tcjuie lure to consult the Uyolur.aud ho added : "If he WAS out of health I should be careful al>out answering vour qtiee tions. As lie ia not I can afford to speak plainly." It appears, 'therefore, that in thoBC who wish to retire Mr. fclaine from , actiVte life ard l»eHeve that he is not in a to Wippor' ttoe fatigues of a campaign thfe wish is father to the thought Philadelphia, Inquirer, Dec. 8.
