Zbt (True ttortbtrner: Dsv? Dav?, Cicbtflan, tfrtbatt, December 13, ICOl. A RABID ATTACK Llado by Cincinnati Doctor on Army Methods. DAG LAW AND TYRANNY He Says, Reign in the Army Medical Department Surgeon-General Un able to Fill the Many Vacancies in the Army. Marion, ()., Dec. 11. Dr. Charles A. L. Heed of Cincinnati, the retiring president of the American Medical as sociation, was given a banquet here last night by the medical profession of northern Ohio. In the course of his remarks on pending congressional topics, viewed from a medical stand point, he said: "It seems from evidence that has re cently come from within the army it self, that the medical department has not only been degraded, but that it is practically without authority. This was strikingly, indeed tragically, il lustrated during the recent war. A commandant was in charge of a quar ter of the entire army. His command was made up of tae.ltower of Ameii can manhooa and was encamped at a health resort. He, however, in viola tion of the prec edent of the usually cultivated and competent gentlemen of the line, but acting under the permis sion of existing army regulations, not only set aside recommendations of his sanitary oiliccrs, but by personal ex ample incited li is men to violate the most fundamental sanitary laws. The result was what might have been ex pected. Of the more than ."0.000 men in his command, 12,000 were invalided, while nearly a thousand died from pte ventable causes. The regulations, however, 1 am advised, fix no respon sibility for this parallel calamity, the enormity of which is only beginning to be understood. It is not surprising that efforts have been made to sup press knowledge- of it. I am advised that the army investigating commit tee, in the interest of public decency, omitted from its public report much testimony on this phase of tin conduct of the war. Ofacers in the service who today agitate this unsavory subject are banished to the Philippines. No wonder the surgeon-general cannot fill the sixty and more vacancies now ex isting in his corps; self-respe?ting medical men are not offering them selves for a degraded service; that is dominated by gag lavs- and tyranny."

DRUTAL AS8AULT. Someone Attacks Washington. Woman While in Bed. Washington, Dec. 11. Mrs. Ad 1 Gil bert Dennis, a fashionable dressmaker, was found in an almost dying condi tion in her room yesterday morning under circumstances that promise to rival the Bonlne muyT case.

S. $10,000,000 BENEFIT OP HIGHER EDUCATION To Be Ueed in the Establishment of a Washington University, Which is to Exceed Anything of Its King in the World, Even Ce lan Institutions. Washington, Dec. 10. The Wash ington 1'ot today says: President Roosevelt has received a letter from Andrew Carnegie in which the latter oilers to make a donation of $10,000,000 to the United Stalib The letter will be referred to congress by. the president in a special message Mr. Carnegie's gift is for the purpose of establishing in Washington a uni versity for higher education. As fa: as his Idea has been developed, it pio poses a gilt after the manner of the bequest of James Srnithson, the Eng lishman who gave $1,000,000 for tau establishment and maintenance of what is now known as the S.ithson institution. Smithson desired the in stitution founded by him to be a factor in the "diffusion of scientific knowl edge." Mr. Carnegie propo.-es that the university which he is to endow, shall be the greatest institution in the world for the development of higher educa tion. He has consulted President Gil man of Johns Hopkins university; President Hadley of Yale; President Eliot of Harvard; President White of Cornell, and all the leading educators of the country. They heartily indorse his plans. The proposed university will not interfere in the least with the educational institutions already estab lished, but will supplement them, for according to the present plan its doors will be open only to those who desire to take up a post-graduate course. Mr. Carnegie also wants the new univer sity to take the lead in original re search so that the United States can eventually stand side by side with Ger many, if not excel that nation in scien tific development. Mr. Carnegie's plan does not piopose a national university in the sense that an appropriation will be asked or needed. The government is simply to be trustee of the magnifi cent endowment, just as it adminis ters the fund bequeathed by Smithson It is probable that a board of regents will be appointed as in the case of the Smithsonian institute, or it may be that the government will be represent ed on the board of directors, which it is contemplated shall consist of men of national reputation. Mr. Carnegie has kept the proposed endowment a secret until he could definitely arrange the plans and scope of the new university. Even yet all these details have not been arranged, so that little more than the outline of his gift can be published. It is known, however, that he does not pro pose to ask from congress a single foot of land upon which the university building will be constructed. The en tire expense is to be borne out of his endowment. No site has yet been se lected. It will, however, necessarily be very large, as it is proposed to erect a series of magnificent struc tures. The amount of money to be given by Mr. Carnegie equals the sum of the present endowment fund of Harvard, and is considerably more than the in vested fund of Yale. With Catholic university, the Methodist university and the proposed Carnegie university. Washington will be the educational center of the country. A McKinley Sunday. Indianapolis, Ind., . Dec. 10.
