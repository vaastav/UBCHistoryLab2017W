Iii my writing my third annual mess age to tho law-making branch of the Government, it is gratifying to be able lo slate that during the past year suc cess has geuerally attended the effort to execute all Uws found upon the statute books. The policy has been not to in quire into the wisdom of the laws al ready enacted, but lo learn their spirit and iutent and to e.iforce them accor dingly. The past year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general pros perity to lhe nation. It has, however, been attended with more tliau usual chastisements iu the loas of life and property by storm aud fire. . These dis asters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature iu our couu try, and lo develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign rations, which coes far towards alleviatiuar the disas ters occasioned by the calamities. The benevolent who have so generoufly showered thur means on the victims of these misfortunes, will reap th&ir re ward in the consciousness of buying performed a noble act, and in receiving the grateful thanks of men. women aud children whose sufferings they have re lieved., 

TREAT! OF WASrilXCTOH. The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year hits been aa event ful one in witnessing two great nations, speaking one 'language and having one lineage, settling by peaceful arbitration disputes of long etanding, and liable at any time to bring those nations into bloodf and hostile conflict Au exai". pie has thus leeu set, nhich, if tuccesfr ful in its final issue, may xut, followed by other civilized ua'-ious aud be the final mean of returning to productive in dustry millions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nations by bay onets and broad swords. I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been con tended since the adjournment . ot Con gress, with her liritanic Majesty, and a copy of the? protocols of the confer ences t? the Commissioners by wLom lucte negotiotions wre concluded. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between the two nations. The various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recom mend Congress at an early day to make the n3C3ssary provisions for lhe tribu-1 nal'at Geneva, and for the several com missions on the part of the United States called for by the treaty. His Majesty the King of Italy, the Presi dent, of the Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, have, each consented io the joint request of the two powers to name an arbitrator for the tribunals at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to . b suit ably expressed for the readiness with which the joint request has bcn com plied with by the appointment of gen tlemen of eminence aud learning to these important positions. His Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to comply with the joint request of tha two governments, and has consented to act as th arbitra tor of the disputed western boundary between lhe United States and Great Britain. The contracting parties to the treaty have undertaken lo regard as between themselves certain principles of public law for which the United States have contended from the commencemeut ot their history. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowl edge oi the other maritime powers, and to invite them to accede' to them. Ne gotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which the invitatien is to bo extended to tbe powers. I recommended the legislation neces sary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty in relation to the Gsheries and to the other matters touching the relations of the United States towards the British North American possessions, to become operative as soon as the proper legisla tion shall be had on the .part' of Great Britain and its possessions. It is rnuch to be desired that thia legislation may become co-operative before the fisher men of the Uritcd States begin to make their arrangements for the coming sea son. . I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith, to the Governors of New York, Pcnu. sylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illi nois and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those Slates, respect ively, the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the object of the ar i the friendly feelings of those Govern j menls are fully ehared by the United btates. AISTUJA. The ratification of the Consular and Naturalization Conventions wUh the Auslrio-Huugarian Empire have been exchanged. iTAi.r. I 'have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of the Church j to the Kingdom of Italy, and the remo val of the Capitol of that Kingdom to Rome. In conformity with the cutab- i lished policy of the United States I have leeoguized this change. The latifications of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy have lieen exchanged The two powers have agreed iu their treaty that private property at sea shsll be ex einpt from capture in case of war be tween the two powers. The Uaited States have spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into the obligations of nations. SPAIN-. The Forty first Congress at its third scssioii made an appropriation for the organization of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain growing out of the insurrection in Cu ba. That commission has siuce beed organized. I transmit herewith the correspond ence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to 1 Loped that this Commission will afford the Claimants a complete remedy for their injuries. It has ben made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over t confer ence at Washington betweeu the pleni- UkeuiiKi it-M iu o(iui miu kut; ':;co South American Republics, which has resulted iu au armistice, ilh the rea sonable assurance of a peruiaueut peace. 

KUSSIA. The intimate fricrwlly relations which have eo long existed between the Uni ted States and Kussia continue undistur bed. The visit of the third son of the Eiopsror is a proof that thrre it no sire on the part of his Government to dlroiuUh the cordia'.j 0f tu0( reift. tions. The te-pilabU receptiou which has bpu j.iV4a t0 the Grand Duke ia a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that Government. SLAVERY IX THE WKST INDIES The true prosperity and greatness of & nation i to be found in the elevation and education of its laborers, and it is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction which were voluntarily piomised by the statesmen of Spain have not been carried out in its West Indian colonies. The laws and regula tions for the apparent abolition of sla very in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in bondago with no hope of release until their lives become a bur den to their employers. I desire lo direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the United States are large holders.- in foreign lands, of this species of property forbidden by the law, of their Adopted country. I re commend to Congress to provide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against lhe holding, owning or dealing in slaves, or being interested in slave property ia foreign lands, either as own ers, hirers, or mortgagers, by persons citizens of the United Slates. CTB.Y. It is to be regretted that the disturb cd condition of the Island of Cuba con tinues to be -a source of annoyance and oi anxiety, ice existence or a pro tracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, without apparent prospect of an enrly termination, can not be other than an object of concern to a people who, while ahbtaiuing from interference in the affairs of other pow ers, naturally desire to see every couu try in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, and the blessings of free institutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban wa ters have been instructed, iu case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of bona fide American citizens, aud to maintain ILj diguily of the flag. It is hoped that, all pending questions with Spain. roiiu out of the nfl'airs of the Secretary of War. I call your aitention to the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1801), which di-continues promotions in the staff corps of the army until pro vided for by Jaw. I recommended that the number of c Ulcers in each grade of tho staff corps be fixed, and that when ever the number in any one grade falls below the number so fixed that the va cancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the ofikc of a chief of corps becomes vacant the place may be filled by a selection from the corns in which the vacancy exists. THE XAVY. The report of lhe Secretary of the Navy shows r.n improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in the expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which lias been adopted and is being extended as far as our material will adnii', of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By these means we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruis ing ground, to visit more frequently the ports where the presence of our flag is desirable and generally to discharge more efficiently lhe appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace, without exceeding the number of men of the expenditures authorized y law. During the past year the navy has, in addition to its regular service, sup plied the men and officers for the vessels of the eoAst nurvey, and has completed the surveys authorized by Congress of the Isthmus of Darien and Tehuantcpec, aud under like authority has sent out an expedition, completely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the North The suggestions of the report as to the necessity for encouraging and im proving the materiel of the nav-, atti the plan recommended for redf.cin" the in Cuba, may be a iivmted iu the spirit oV.personncl of the service a peace "stan peace and Ooneilition which lias hither dard by the gradu-1, abolition of certain JTiTGitEELKY says he warned Grant, personally,' more than a year ago, that the people wouldn't stand the telegraph swindle.

The earlj' action of Confress in this rccommcn dation would put it in the power of the War Department to place a force in the field during the next summer. FRANCE AND GERMANY. The resumption of diplomatic rela tions between France and Germany have enabled me to give -directions for the withdrawal f the protection extended , to Germans in Fiance by the diplomat , ic ai'd ronaula-4 representatives of the United States in that rni't v. It is catacazt. The inexcusable course f the Russ ian Miuiater at Wanhiugtoa rer deiad it necessary to ask his recall, and to de cline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic . representative. It was impossible, with self respect or with a just regard to the dignity of the coun try, to permit M Catacaxy to continue to hold intercourse with this Govern ment after abuse of the Government of ficial and during his persistent interfe rence, through various means, with the re'a'ioes between the United States and other powers, lu accordance with my wishes, this Government has bees re lieved of further intercourse with M. C&tacazv, and the management of the affairs &f the imperial legation has pars ed into the hands of a gentleman ei t re ly unobjectionable. JArAH. With Japan we continue "to maintain intimate relations. The Cabiaet of the Mikado has, stnee the close of the last session of Congress, selected citizens of the Uuitd Stales to aeive in important offices in several departments of the Government. I have rccson to thick that this selection is due to an apprecia tion of the disinterestedness of the pol icy which the United States have pur sued towards Japan. CHINA. It is our desire to continue to main lain thia disinterested and just policy with China as well a Japan. The cor respondence transmitted herewith show that there ia no disposition on tha part of thia government to swerve from its established course. Prompted by a desire to put an end to the batbarous treatment of our ship wrecked sailors on the Corean coast, I instructed our Minister at Pekin to en deavor to conclude a convention with Corea for securing the safety and hu mane treatment of such marines. Ad miral Rogers was instructed to accom pany him with a sufficient force to pro tect "him in case of teed. A small sur veying party was sent out On reach ing tbe coast it was treacherously at tacked at a disadvantage. Ample op portunity was given for explanation and apology for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed, and after an ardaons march over a rugged and dif ficult country, tbe forts from which the outrages had been committed were gal lantly assaulted and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals aud having vindicated the Lojw of the flag, the expeditiou relumed, finding it im practicable under the circumstances to conclude the desired convention. 1 respectfully reier lo tue correspon dence relating thereto herewith submitt ed, and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see tit to take. MEXICO. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable law es tablishing what is known as tho free zone cu the frontier of the United Stales. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also that moia stringent measures may ba taken by that Repub lic for restraining lawless persons on the frontiers. I hore lhat Mexico, by its own action, will soon relieve this Government of the difficulties expe rienced from these causes. CKNTBAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. Our relations with the various Repub lics of Central and South America con tinue, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly. I recommend some ac tion by Congress regarding the overdue installments, under the award of the Yenezuelan Claims Commission of 1800. The internal dissensions of this govern ment present no justification far the ab sence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchan ged. It is a subject of congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory steps toward tha abolition of slavery. Our relations with that Empire, always cordial, will raturallv le made mere to by thia act. It is not to guided the two nations in their IrtfUt ment of such questions. 

JAPAK.S1KO AllEKlCAii Y0CTH. To give iftipoitanco and lo add to the efficiency of o';;r diplomatic relations with Jf.pau and China,and to further and in retaining tfie .oou opinion or those people, and to secure to the United States its share of tha commerce des tined to flow between those nations, and the balance tf the commercial world. I earnestly recommend that aa Impropria tion be made to BupDy.t at least four American youth- In each of those coun tries, to -rTe as a part of the official f'Tnilfi rt "nr miiiiktpra there. Our representative would not even then be placed upon an equality with tbe repre- M-utativea of Great JUntain and some other parties. As now situated, our rep resentatives in Japaa and China have to depend for interpreters and transla tors upon native of tboe countries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employes iu furttigrt business houses, or the interpreters of other foreign minis ters. I would also recommend liberal meas ures for the purpose of aiding the Amer ican line of steamers now plyintr be tween San Fr encisco and Japan and Chi na, and the Australian hue, almost our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and of increasing their service. TBE NATIONAL DEBT. The National debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057,126 80 during the year, aad by the negotiation of na tional bonds at a lower, rate of interest, tha interest of the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for the iutciest account is near ly seventeen million dollars leas than on the first of March, 1800. A LET CP RECOMMENDED IN PAYING THE DEBT. It waa highly desirable that this rapid diminution shoald take place both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince ita citizens of their, entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankrupting them; but in view of the accomplishment of these desira ble ends, of the rapid development of the resources of the country.its increas ing ability to meet large demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desi rable that the present resources of the countrv should continue to be taxed in order to continue thia ispid payment. I therefore, recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal tax laws. . 

REDUCTION OF TAXATION. I recommend that all taxes from in ternal sources be abolished except those on spiritous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps. THE TARIFF. In the readjustment of the tariff suggest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue col lectcd under the present laws, after pro vidinc for the current expenses of tlie Government, the interest account, and the sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as to afford the gieatest relief to the greatest num ber. There are many articles not pro duced at home, such as medicines com pounded, etc., from which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into very general use. Ail fcuch articles J recommend to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisa ble, I would then recommend that it be made upon those articles which can bear it without disturbing heme production or reduce the wages of American labor. 1 have not entered into figures because to do so would be to repeat all that is laid before you in the report of the Scc retaiy of the treasury. r.XVNCE 

LAWS. The present laws for collecting rev enue pay collectors of customs small salaries, but provide for shares in seiz ures, which, at the principal ports of entry particularly, raise the "compensa tion of" ihesc officials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this sys tem must at times work viciously. It holds out inducements to dishonest men, sh'Hild such get possession of these of Sccs,to be lax in their sciutiny of goods enteied, to enable thrm to finally make large seizures. Your attention is re spectfully invited to this subject. 

COLD SPECULATION. The continued fluctuations in the val ue of gold, as eompnicd with the Na tional currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and develop ment of the country in keeping up pri ces of all articles necessary in every day life. It fosters a spirit of gambling prejudicial alike to National morals and the National finances. If the question can be met, as to how to get a fixed val ue to our currency, lhat value constant ly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained. THE JRMT. As to lb operations of the a' mv du- grades of officers., the reduction of oth ei and the employment of some in the service of the commercial marine, are well considerec'.and deserve the thought ful attentiou of Congress. I also recommed that all promotions in the Navy above the rank of Captain be by selection instead of seniority. This course' will secure in the higher grades ffve-ater efficiency, and hold out ap. "uiceutive to young officers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their profession. The present coat of maintaining the Navy, and its cost compared with that of the preceding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year, are contained in the accompanying report of. the Secre tary of the Navy. THE 

TOSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. The enlarged receipts of the Post- office Department, as shown by the ac comi aoying report of the Post Master General, exhibits a gratifying increase in that branch of the public service. It ia the index of the growth of education and of lhe prosperity of the peopl,two elemeuts highly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With avast territory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring the services of the mail, it is not at present to ' be expected that this department can be made self sustaining, but gradual ap proitch to this end from year to year is confidently relied on, aud the Postofflce Department of the Government will prove a much greater blessing " to the whole people than it is now. The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in the depart ment presided over by him, are earnest ly recommended to your special atten tion, especially the documents looking to the favorable consideration of the plan for uniting the telegraph system of the united States with the nostal system It is believed that by such a course the cost of. telegraphing could be much re duced. and the service as well, if not better, rendered.

Several hundred whose criminality was ascertained lo be of an inferior degree were released for the present These have generally made confessions of their guilt. Great cau tion has been exercised in making these arrests, and notwithatanding .lhe large number, it is believed that no innocent person is now in custody. The prison ers will be held for regular trial before the judicial tribunals of the United States; As soon as it appeared that the au thorities of the United States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law many persons absconded, and there is good ground for supposing that all of 6uch persons have violated the law.
