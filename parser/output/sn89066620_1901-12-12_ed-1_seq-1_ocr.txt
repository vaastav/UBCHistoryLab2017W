The president ;y ; ' urges strongly the necessity of '. V,; i preserving our forests and the ' importance to tho west of a t t proper conservation of the vast j amounts of water that now an- t nually go to waste. The presidont adyises congress that nothing better can be done for the Philippines than throw ing them open to industrial enter prise by granting limited fran chises under proper safeguards. A reduction in turiff duties on t- Cuban imports to the United States is recommended, and home stead laws are suggested for Porto Rico. The attention of congress is called to the crying need of a Pacific cable, and in 6otting forth tho successful negotiations of the isthmiau canal treaty with Eng land, President iloosovolt ex presses the hope that work will soon begin. The Monroe doctrine is defined as simply a step toward insuring the world's universal peace. A greater navy is recommended as the best guaranty against war and the cheapest ac J most effec tive peace insurance. ' President Roosevelt consider tho army large enough for pres ent needs.

The record of Stone Is of great interest at this time, for, while bo may nover be sena tor, he may help make i republi can senator, or rather bis candi dacy may: "We are interested in Stone's candidacy for tbe senate. We can't help it We foel we should do all in our power to keep him in tbe race, for his candidacy is a greater handicap to his party than that of any of tho other men mentioned, and whenever we can handicap the democratic party we feel obligated to be on hand. Whenever Stone ' has appeared before tbe people as a candidate ho has been an exceedingly weak one. When he was a candidate for congress this County gave a majority to the republican slate ticket of 423, while tho republi can candidate carried it over Stone by a majority of 9S7. The records show these figures. When Stone was the candidate for governor he ran behind Cleve land in the state by 11,000, or to be strictly accurate, Stono carried the state by 26,061. while Cleve land carried it by 40,754. "Stone's subsequent record has not increased his popularity. Ho Iium been a free silvcritu of the most radical stripo ready to fol low the sacred ratio as far and faithfully as was Ruth to follow Naomi, lie has also been willing to shove the sacred ratio in the background, to regard it a secondary, llo has been an im perialist. He has been an anti imperialist. He has posed as tho enemy of corporations. Ho has made a fortune in the service of the corporatious. Ho has howled against the lobby at Jefferson City. He has been one of the most obnoxious and persistent of lobbyist who ever visited the capital. In short William J. Stone has carried wator on both shoulders and would have carried it on a third had he-been so anatomically constructed. Ho is scold, calculating hypocrite and recognized as such. "That Stone is an ingrate is also known. When he Tan for congress and when 'he made tbe race for governor he was callod a corporation candidate, for it was said that in both instances be owed bij nomination to Dill Phelps. Bo that as it may, the following story by R. C. Friend, who was democratic manager in this coutny tboyear that Stone ran for congress, shows Stone s in debtedness to Phelps. Mr. Friend states that .the county committee assessed Stone HOC as his share of the campaign expenses, which Stone refused to pay, aud at the! last meeting of tho county com mittee held before tho election to arrange for printing the ballots, the committeo decided to lea ye Stone's name off tho ticket. Ac cording to Friend, Phelps paid the assessment himself, and thus saved Stone. If Stone's friends would like to know whother or not he ever paid Phelps, they can easily ascertain the facts. We all know, however, how Stone returned those favors received in tbe early days of the Stone Phelps partnership by bis ulti matum of a year ago that Phelps should not bo a delogate at-large to the national couvention. Sonio of us heard that fatuous speech of Pbelps' when he christened btoue the shcll-hidcr, about as appropriate an epithet as was ever coined. And tbogh the squubblo was none of ours, we watched it. with a great deal of curosity, and we realized that it was the ingratitude of Stoue, as much as the power of Phelps, which enabled the latter to Carry the east district of Jasper county by a unanimous vote when tbe issue was presented, Phil pa or Stone. . "So wo want to keep Stone in the race. Ilia senatorial cam paign is of vast service to us. llu is one of the conditions neces sary to keep the democratic i trouble pot boiling, aud he's I doing it."

A teacher who cad out rud n train certainly should have his name placed on the roll of honor. It is etatad that Prof. McCarty, of Caruthersvllle, boat'the Houck train to llayti and then took it and attended tho teachers' asso ciation at Fartnington. The case of Mrs. Fannie E. West against the Cotton Belt railroad for $10,000 damagos for permanent injuries sustained by getting off the train was decided at Kennett last week. Tho jury gave Mrs. West $5,000 dumages. Ely & Kelso represented Mrs. West, and W. H. M'ller repre sented the Cotton Iielt. Tbe caso will go to the supreme court.

We note, as usual, the greater putt of those on the prosrnuu were like the fellow's corn come up miss ing. Why don't those teachers who accept a place on program, got As our brothers of the Farmlngton Herald say, teachers in these associations ri too theoretical.

Ex-Represemtative Caud- well has sure stirred up trouble in tho democratic ranks by his attack on the legislature. In looking over the record of U. C. Kerens, we see nothing for which he should be turned down, hence wo hope to see him win. Cut and dried thiugs will not go in the republican meetings his year. The people are eoing to ta.'lO things in hand, hence the bosses od either sido may not get in their full work. Sam B. Cook acknowledges that the democratic campaign Tund received $0,000 from the St. Louis Transit company, a big corporation. Yet the duinocrats pretend to tight corporations.
