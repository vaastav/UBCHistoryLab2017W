CONGRESS Fifty-Sixth House and Senate Lis ten to the President's Rec ommendations. OUR PHILIPPINES DUTY PLAIN Must Crush Insurrection and Es tablish Order—Future Rule Rests With Congress. TRUSTS AND MONETARY REFORM National and State Legislatures Should Co-opcrato to Regu late Combines—For the Gold Standard. Washington, Dec. 5.—President. Mc Kinley's message was read in congress this afternoon: lo the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: At the threshold of vour deliberations you are called to mourn with your countrymen the death of ice President Hobart, who passed from this life on the morning of No vember 21 last. His great soul now rests in eternal peace. His private life was pure and elevated, while his pub lic career was ever distinguished by large capacity, stainless integrity, and exalted motives. He has been removed from the high office which he honored and dignified, but. his lofty character, his devotion to duty, his honesty of purpose and noble virtues remain with Pr'ce'ess legacy and example. Ihe Fifty-sixth congress convenes in its first regular session with the coun try in a condition of unusual prosper ity, of universal good will among the people at home, and in relations of peace and friendship with every gov ernment of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great inerease in volume and value. The combined im ports and exports for the year are the largest ever shown by a single year in all our history. Our exports for 1S99 alone exceeded our imports and ex ports combined in 1870. The imports per capita are 20 per cent less than in while the exports per capita are 58 per 3S70, while the exports per capita are 58 per cent more than in 1870, showing the enlarged capacity of the United States to satisfy the wants of its own increasing population, as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of other nations. Exports ot' agricultural products were $784,776,142. Of manufactured products we exported in value $339, 592,146, being larger than any previous year. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1898 and 1899. Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, including $11,798,314.14,' part payment of the Central Pacific rail road indebtedness, aggregated $610, 9S2,004.35. Customs receipts were $200,12S,481.75, and those from internal revenue $273,437,161.51 For the fiscal year the expenditures were $700,093,564.02, leaving a deficit of $89,111,559.67. The secretary of the treasury esti mates that the receipts for the cur rent fiscal year will aggregate $640, 958,112, and upon the basis of present appropriations the expenditures will aggregate $600,958,112, leaving a sur plus of $40,000,000. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, the internal revenue receipts were increased about $100,000,000. Strength of the Treusury. The present gratifying strength of the treasury is shown by the fact that on December 1, 1899, the available cash balance was $278,004,837.72, of which $239,7-14,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion. The conditions ,of confidence which prevail throughout the country have brought gold into more general use and customs receipts are now al most entirely paid in that coin. The strong condition of the treasury with respect to cash on hand and the favorable showing made by the reve nues have made it possible for the sec retary of the treasury to take action under the provisions of section 3694, revised statutes, relating to the sink ing fund. Receipts exceeded expendi tures for the first five months of the current fiscal year by $13,413,389.91, and, as mentioned above, the secretary of the treasury estimates that there will be a surplus of approximately $40,000,000 at the end of the year. Un der such conditions it was deemed ad visable and proper to resume compli ance with the provisions of the sink ing fund law, which for eight years has not been done because of the de ficiency in the revenue. The treasury department therefore offered to pur chase during November $25,000,000 of the 5 per cent loans of 1904, or, the 4 per cent funded loan of 1907, at the current market price. The amount of fered and purchased during November was $1S,408,600. The premium paid by the government on such purchases was $2,263,521 and the net saving in in terest was about $2,685,000. The suc cess of this operation was sufficient to induce the government to continue the offer to purchase bonds to and in cluding the 23d day of December, inst., unless the remainder of the $25, 000.000 called for should be presented in the meantime by redemption. Increased activity'in industry with its welcome attendants—a large em ployment of labor at higher wages— gives to the body of people a larger power to absorb the circulating me dium. It is further true that year by year with larger areas of land under cultivation, the increasing volume of agricultural products, corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume of ioney supply. This is especially no •ii cable at the crop harvests and ci- ip moving period. its earlier history the national i-ateiig act seemed to prove a reason­ »,, f- i-' H,*- vr, •y'w able avenue through which needful additions to the circulation could from time to time be made. Chang ing conditions have apparently ren dered'it now inoperative to that end. The high margin in bond securities required, resulting from large prem iums which government bonds com mand in the market, or the tax on note issues, or both operating togeth er, appear to be the influences which impair its public utility. The attention of congress is respect fully invited to this important mat ter with the view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable modi fications can be made in the national banking act as will render its service in the particulars here referred to more responsive to the people's needs. I again urge that national banks be authorized to organize with a. capital of $25,000. To Maintain Gold Standard. I urgently recommend that to sup port the existing gold standard, and to maintain "the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and sil ver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the market and in the payment of debts," the secre tary of the treasury be given addi tional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ such other effective means as may be necessary to those ends. The authority should include the pow er to sell bonds on long and short time, as conditions may require, and should provide for a rate of interest lower than that fixed by the act of January 14, 1875. While there is now no commercial fright which with draws gold from the government,1 but, on the contrary, such widespread con fidence that gold seeks the treasury demanding paper money in exchange, yet the very situation points to the present as the most fitting time to make adequate provision to insure the continuance of the gold standard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose of the government to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilized world recognizes as the best. The financial transactions of the government are conducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United States bonds, and use gold for their payment. We are maintain ing the parity of all the money issued or coined by authority of the govern ment. We are doing these things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are not compelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past, however, and may have to be done in the future. It behooves us, therefore, to provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when it arises, and the best means are those which are the most certain and economical. Those now authorized have the virtue neither of directness or economy. We have already eliminated one of the causes of our financial plight and embarrass ment during the years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896. Our receipts now equal our expenditures deficient revenues no longer create alarm. Let us remove the only remaining cause by confer ring the full and necessary power vn the secretary of the treasury and im pose upon him the duty to uphold the present gold standard and preserve the. coins of the two metals on a par ity with each other, which is the re peatedly declared policy of the United States. In this connection I repeat my fortn er recommendations that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund, from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed, shall not thereafter be paid out except for gold. For Merchant Marine Subsidy. The value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our com mercial tt-ade and the strengthening of Our power upon the sea, invites the immediate action of congress. Our national development will be one-sided and unsatisfactory so long as the re markable growth of our inland indus tries remains unaccompanied by prog ress on the seas. There is no lack of constitutional authority for legisla tion which shall give to the country maritime strength commensurate with its industrial achievements and with its rank among the nations of the earth. The past year has recorded excep tional activity in our shipyards, and the promises of continual prosperity in shipbuilding are pbundant. Ad vanced legislation for the protection of our seamen has been enacted. Our coast trade, under regulations wisely framed at the beginning of the gov ernment and since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequalled in our records or those of any other power. We shall fail to realize our opportuni ties, however, if we complacently re gard only matters at home and blind ourselves to the necessity of securing our share in the valuable carrying trade of the world. Last year American vessels trans-, ported a smaller share of our exports and imports than during any former year in all our history, and the meas ure of our dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested to our people. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the de partments of the government charged with military and naval operations in the east and West Indies, had to ob tain from foreign flags merchant ves sels essential for those operations. The other great nations have not. hesitated to adopt, the required means to develop their shipping as a factor in national defense, and as one of the surest and speediest means of obtain ing for their producers a share in for eign markets. Like vigilance and ef fort on our part cannot fail to im prove our situation, which is regard ed with humiliation at home and with surprise abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices, which at the beginning may be involved, will be offset, later "by more than equivalent gains. The expense is as nothing com pared to the advantage to be achieved. The re-establishment of our merchant marine involves in a large measure our continued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial tri umphs. 1 am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our merchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild our sea carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture which, with the increase of dur navy, mean more work and wages to our countrymen, as well as tj a safeguard to American interests in every part of th world. The Qur«!.ioii of Trusts. Combinations of capital organized into trusts to control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle competition, limit production and de termine the prices of products used and ccii uined by the people, are just ly provoking public discussion, and should '^arly claim the attention of the congress. Th- industrial commission, created by the act of the congress of June 18, 1898, has been engaged in extended hearings upon the disputed questions involved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade and competition. They have not yet completed their in vestigation of this subject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may arrive are undeter mined! The subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature and variety, or cause and extent, of the injuries to the public which may result from large combinations con centrating more or less numerous en terprises and establishments, which previously to the formation of the combination were carried on separ ately. It is universally conceded that com binations which engross or control the market of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by sup pressing natural and ordinary com petition, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the geaieral consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common law, but also to the public welfare. There must b«i a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations. If the present law can be extended more certainly to control or cheek thes' monopolies or trusts, it should be don without dela|y. Whatever power th congress possesses over this most im portant subject should be promptly ascertained and asserted. President Harrison in his annual message of December 3, 1889, »says: Earnest attention should be given by congress to a consideration of the ques tion how far the restraint of those com binations of capital commonly called 'trusts' is matter of federal Jurisdiction. When organized, as they often are, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity they are dangerous conspiracies against the public good, and should be made the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation. The Iiiiw of 180O. An act to protect trade and com merce against unlawful restraints and monopolies was passed by congress on the 2d of July, 1890. The provisions of this statute are comprehensive and stringent. It declares every contract or combination, in the form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in the re straint of trade or commerce among th(S' several states or with foreign na tions, to be unlawful. It denominates as a criminal every person \vho makes any such contract or engage:) in any such combination or conspiracy, and provides a punishment, by ir or im prisonrut-.ii. It invests the several cir cuit, courts of the United States with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of the act, and makes it the duty of the several United States dis trict attorneys, under thei direction of the attorney general, to institute pro ceedings in equity to prevent and re strain such violations. It further con fers upon any person who shall be in jured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by rei.son of anything forbidden or de clared to be unlawful by the act the power to sue therefor in any circuit court of the United States without spect to the amount in controversy, and to recover three-fold the damages by him sustained and the costs of the suit, including reasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that the act is aimed at every kind of combination in the nature of a trust or monopoly in restraint of interstate or interna tional commerce. The prosecution by the United States of offenses under the act of 1890 has been frequently resorted to in the federal courts, and notable efforts in the restraint of interstate commerce, such as the Trans-Missouri Freight as sociation and the Joint Traffic' associ ation, have been successfully opposed and suppressed. Cleveland Quoted. President Cleveland in his annual message of December 7, 1S9G—more than six years subsequent to the en actment of this law—after stating the evils of these trust combinations, says: Though congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enfo.rce them, but simply because the laws them selves as interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by fur ther legislation it should be done. The fact must be recoghized, however, that all federal legislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because of inherent obstacles, and also because of the complex character of our govern mental system, which, while making the federal authority supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds which cannot be transgressed. The decision of our high est court on this precise question ren ders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies can be ade quately treated through federal action unless they seelc directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation or intercourse between states or between the United States and foreign countries. It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that may be applied. Even though It may be found that federal authority is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the pojver of the several states to act effectively in the premises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously exercise such power. Uniform State Legislation Needed The state legislation to which Pres ident Cleveland looked for relief from the evils of trusts has failed to accom plish fully that object This is prob ably due to a great extent to the fact that different states take different views as to the projier way to discrim inate between evil and injurious com binations and those associations which are beneficial and necessary to the business prosperity of the country. The great diversity of treatment in different states arising from this cause and the intimate relations of all parts of the country to each other without regarding state lines in the conduct of business have made the enforce ment of state laws difficult. It is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the several states is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such uniformity founded in a wise and just discrimina­ %%m® tion between what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in busi ness operations may be obtained and that means may be found for the con gress within the limitations of its con stitutional power so to supplement an effective, code of state legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the United Stats adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rules to which I have re ferred. The whole question is so important and far reaching that I nm sure no part of it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have the studied deliberation of the congress, resulting in wise and judicious action. —t~- THE 

PHILIPPINES PROBLEM. Revolt Must Be Crushed and Amer ican Sovereignty Established. On the 10th of December, 189S, the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain was signed. It pro vided, among other things, that Spain should cede to the United States the archipelago known as the Philippine islands, that the United States should pay to Spain the sum of $20,000,000 and that the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories thus ceded to the United States should be determined by con gress. The treaty was ratified by the senate on the 6th of February, 1899, and by the government, of Spain on the 19th of March following. The rati fications were exchanged on the 11th of April, and the treaty publicly pro claimed. On the 2d of March the con gress voted the sum contemplated by the tresvty and the amount was paid over to the Spanish government on the 1st of May. In this manner the Philippines came to the United1 States. The islands were ceded by the government of Spain, which had been in undisputed possession of them for centuries. They were accepted, not merely by our au thorized commissioners in Paris, un der the direction of the executive, but by the constitutional and well-consid ered action of the representatives of the people of tfie United States in both houses of congress. I had every reason to believe, and I still believe, that- this transfer of sovereignty was in accordance with the wishes and the aspirations of the great masses of the Filipino people. From the earliest moment no oppor tunity was lost of assuring the people of the islands of our ardent desire for their welfare and of the intention of this government to do everything pos sible to advance their interests. In my order of the 19th of May, 1S98, the commander of the military expedition dispatched to the Philippines was in structed to declare that we came not to make war upon the people of that country, "nor upon any party or fac tion among them, but to protect them in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights." That there should be no doubt as to the paramount authority there, on the 17th of August it was de clared that "there must be no joint oc cupation with the insurgents that the United States must preserve the peace and protect persons and prop erty within the territory occupied by their military and naval forces that the insurgents and all others must recognize the military occupation and authority of the United States. As early as December 4, before the cession, and in anticipation of that event, the commander in Manila, was urged to restore peace and tranquility and to undertake the establishment of a. beneficent government, which should afford the fullest security for life and property. On the 21st of December, after the treaty was signed, the commander of the forces of occupation was instruct ed "to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that- we come, not- as invaders and conquerors, but as friends to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights." On the same day, while or dering General Otis to see that the peace should be preseryed at Iloilo, he was admonished that: "It is most im portant that there should be no con flict with the insurgents." On the 1st day of February. 1899, urgent orders were reiterated that- the kindly inten tions of this government should be in every possible way communicated to the insurgents. Commission Sent to Manila. On the 21st of January I announced my intention of dispatching to Manila a commission composed of three gen tlemen of the highest character and distinction, thoroughly acquainted with the orient, who, in association with Admiral Dewey and Major Gen eral Otis, were instructed to "facili tate the most humane and effective extension of authority throughout the islands, and to secure with the least possible delay the. benefits of a wise and generous protection of life and property to the inhabitants." These gentlemen were: Dr. .lacob Gould Sehurman. president- of Cornell uni versity the Hon. Charles Den by, for many years minister to Cliina, and Professor Dean C. Worcester, of the University of Michigan, who made most careful study of life in the Phil ippines. While the treaty of peace was under consideration in the sen ate, these commissioners set out on their mission of good-will and liber ation. Their character was a suf ficient- guarantee of the beneficent purpose with which they went, even if they had not borne the positive in structions of this government, which made their errand pre-eminently one of peace and friendship. AVork of a Few Plotters. But before their arrival at, Manila ihe sinister ambition of a few leaders of the Filipinos had created a situa tion full of embarrassments for us and most grievous in its consequences to themselves. The clear and impar tial pieliminary report of the commis sioners, which I transmit herewith, gives so lucid and comprehensive a history of the present insurrectionary movement that the story need not be here repeated. It is enough to say that the claim of the rebel leader that he was promised independence by any of ficer of the United States in return for his assistance has no foundation in fact and is categorically denied by the very witnesses who were called to prove it. The most the insurgent leader hoped for when he came back to Ma nila was the liberation of the islands ~d& **•*. I from the Spanish control, which they had been laboring for years without success to throw off. The prompt accomplishment of this work by the American army and navy gave him other ideas and ambitions, and insidious suggestions from va rious quarters perverted the purposes and intentions with which lie had taken up arms. No sooner had our army captured Manila than the Fili pino forces began to assume an atti tude of suspicion and hostility which the utmost efforts of our oflicers and troops were unable to disarm or modi fy. Their kindness and forbearance were taken as a proof of cowardice. The aggressions of the Filipinos con tinually increased until finally, just before the time set by the senate of the United States for a vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently pre pared in advance, was made all along the American lines, which resulted in a terribly destructive and saguinary repulse of the insurgents. Filipino Massacre Plot. Ten days later an order of the in surgent government was issued to its adherents who remained in Manila, of which General Otis justly observes that "for barbarous intent it is lin equaled in modern times." It directs that at 8 o'clock on the night of the 15th of February, the territorial militia shall come together in the streets of San Pedro, armed with their bolos, with guns and ammuni tion, where convenient that Filipino families only shall be respected but that, all other individuals, of whatever race they may be, shall be extermin ated without any compassion, after the extermination of the army of oc cupation, and adds: "Urothers, we must avenge ourselves on the Amer icans and exterminate them, that we may take our revenge for the in famies and treacheries which they have committed upon 'us. Have no compassion upon them attack with vigor." A copy of this fell, by good fortune, into the hands of our offi cers and they were able to take meas ures to control the rising, which was actually attempted on the night of February 22, a week later than was originally contemplated. A consider able number of armed insurgents en tered the city by waterways and swamps and in concert, with confed erates inside attempted to destroy Manila, by fire. They were kept in check during the night and the next day driven out of the city with heavy loss. This was the unhappy condition of affairs which confronted our commis sioners on their arrival in Manila. They had come with the hope and in tention of co-operating with Admiral Dewey and Major General Otis in es tablishing peace and order in (he arch ipelago and the largest measure of self government compatible with the true welfare of the people. What they actually found can best be set forth in their own words: War Was Una voidable. "Deplorable as war is, the one in which we are now engaged was un avoidable by us. We were attacked by a bold, adventurous and enthusi astic army. No alternative was left to us except ignominious retreat. "It is net to be conceived of that any American would have sanctioned the surrender of Manila to the insur gents. Our obligations to other na tions and to the friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and our flag demanded that force should be met by force. Whatever the future of the Philippines may be, there is no course open to us now except the prosecution of the war until the insurgents are reduced to submission. The commission is of the opinion that there has been no time since the destruction of the Spanish squadron by Admiral Dewey when it was possible to withdraw our forces from the islands, either with honor to ourselves or with safety to the inhab itants." The course thus clearly indicated has been unflinchingly pursued. The rebellion must be put down. Civil government cannot be thoroughly es tablished until order is restored. With a devotion and gallantry worthy of its most brilliant history, the army, ably and loyally assisted by the navy, has carried on this unwelcome, but most righteous, compaign with richly de served success. The noble self sacri fices with which our soldiers and sail ors whose terms of service had ex pired refused to avail themselves of their right to return home as long as they were needed at the front forms one of the brightest pages in our an nals. Although their operations have been somewhat interrupted and checked by a rainy season of unusual violence and duration, they have gained ground steadily in every direc tion, and now look forward confident ly to a speedy completion of their task. Work of Reconstruction. The unfavorable circumstances con nected with an active campaign have not been permitted to interfere with the equally important work of recon struction. Again I invite your atten tion to the report of the commission ers for the interesting and encourag ing details of the work already ac complished in the establishment of peace and order and the inauguration of self governing municipal life in many portions of the archipelago. A notable beginning has been made in the establishment of a government in the island of Negros, which is deserv ing of special consideration. This was the first island to accept Ameri can sovereignty. Its people unreserv edly proclaimed allegiance to the United States and adopted a constitu tion looking to the establishment of a popular government. It was impossi ble to guarantee to the people of Ne gros that the constitution so adopted should be the ultimate form of gov ernment. Such a question, under the treaty with Spain, and in accordance with our own constitution and laws, came exclusively within the jurisdic tion of congress. The government ac tually set up by the inhabitants of Negros eventually proved unsatisfac tory to the natives themselves. A new system was put into force by ord er of the major general commanding the department, of which the follow ing are the most important elements: It was ordered that the government of the island of Negroi should consist of a military governor appointed by the United States military governor of the Philippines, and a civil governed and an advisory council elected by I people.
