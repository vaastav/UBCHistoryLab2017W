How bad -our friends in Saline coun ty" will feel wheii they find out that the lands restored do not touch that county, and how "faithfully and effectivelly" "that promise has been redeemed." The land restored lies West of the 100th meridian, Saline county is East of that meridian ; the restored tract lies South of the south line of town five, which line makes the southern boundary of Saline county ! The lands granted to railroads are usually cf those nearest to the road bed ; the Kansas Pacific Railroad held these lands while their survey located that road cn the Republican Fork in Nebras ka ; the company not Morton having changed their route to the Smoky Hil Fork, in Kansas, our lands had to be re linquished and other lands near the new route chosen !

The following facts on immigration to Southern Nebraska we take from the Nebraska City Press of the 24th : "We enquired of Mr. Bebout. nroDrie tor cf the ferry at this place, a few days ago, what number of families have cross u here to settle in Nebraska, nnd the astonishing reply was, that for the last four months, 'ttdios Noveraber"15th. not less than ten families per day have cross ed. Last evening we met Mr. W. S. Morgan, of the ferry at Brewnvillej and he informed us that for the same length of time twenty families daily, at the lowest estimate, had crossed at that place, making a total at these two places of three thousand six hundred and ninety families. These families will average five persons each, so our readers cau, by a slight calculation see that our popula tion has been increased, eighteen thous and four hundred and fifty."

The houses were both burned to the ground, and his family are thus left without house or home. The case is a deploralle one and must secure for the family the sympathy and assistance of community. Norause can be given for this fit of inssnity save the losses recently sustained by Mr uveacker financially, over which he seemed constantly brooding. Nice place to Jive in is Nebraska City very!

The advancement made by the stu dents in their several studies excelled the most sangui'ie expectations of their friends, who were in attendance from different pans cf the county, both iq the advancement and in thorough mastering of the rudiments of the several brunches engaged in- In this connection I would remark that if praise be due to either class above the rest, that, to my mind, it belongs to the commencing Grammer Class; in justice, however, to ihe other classes 1 must say that all did well. Their examination" gave conclusive evi dence of the efficiency of Prof. M'Ken zie as a teacher, and the close applica tion of the students. The classes in Thompson's higher Ar ithmatic, Algebra, Book-keeping, As tronomy, and Vocal Music, all acquitted themselves very credibly. The exhibition, although not intended to be anything more than the .regular school series, was quite interesting ; both the com position, and declaiming of select pieces, woulil ha va done credit to school of longer standing. The School has labored under some disadvantages during the past Term, which will be obviated for the next, which will commence on the 13:h of the present month, in the Seminary building. This buildio , though not completed, will be so arranged that ihe tchool will occupy it with comfort to all. The list of students for the term to commence on the 13th in?t., show3 that (he number will b& fully up to the facili ties for their accommodation, which num ber will probably reach SO or 100. Wa.
