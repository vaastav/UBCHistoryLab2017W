HOUSE ALL STIRRED UP m7.^ZSCX OF ?ir?LIFIED SPELL ING AGAIN DISCUSSED. ? Representative Crumpacker of Indiana started a rumpus in the House this afternoon by making a point of order against tire paragraph in the legislative, executive and Judicial appropriation bill directing the public printer to stick to the old style spelling in turning out public documents. The committee members on the floor evidently had not expected such a jolt, but thVy rallied their forces and attacked Representative Crumpacker, front, flank and rear. They pointed out the vast sums of money it would cost to print public documents two waym?one way for the President and another way for Congress. They spoke of chaos and confusion that would result it their divided proposition were followed, tliey talked of the ridiculous position the government would occupy and they appealed to Mr C'rumpacker to stand with his colleagues and resent this new form of executive usurpation. .Mr. Crumpacker reserved his point of order in ord-er that he might get the full benefit of all the arguments, but the blast of hot air that came his way must have made him wish he had turned the damper down. Mr. Tawney, chairman of the appropriations committee, took up the expense end and told of the investigation the committee had made, which showed very plainly that it would cost a great deal of money in printing and proof reading to let both the President and Congress have tnelr own private brands of orthography. He mentioned. too. that the government would look silly to the people of this country and every other country if it permitted such a policy as this to last. T>. itifin t > (ii'n CnlUi-o n r\f Ufa eaa nhnoottc appealed to Mr. Crumpaeker to get together with everybody e'se and prevent the President from establishing a court language for his new American empire. "If the President has a right to change these ?*> words," said Mr. Sullivan, "he has a right to change more and more until we may well have a new language. The old method was certainly good enough before the reign of the present President and I think the majority of the members of the House think it is good enough now. Representative I.acey of Iowa and other members of the House spoke In the same vein. But Mr. Crumpaeker remained unmoved. He thought it was unwise to legislate on matter of spelling and he gave his reasons for this belief. Discussing Point of Order. Discussion of the point of order was undertaken by half a dozen members at once, most of them attempting to express the view?which seemed to be held all over the chamber?tiiat the committee in inserting the provision directing the public printer to stick to established standards of spelling had not. in effect, made a change in exist lug law, but Had merely embodied In the mt asure-a direction as to how the existing law should be carried out by the public printer. This was the view taken by Representa- ' tive Grosvenor of Ohio, who insisted that the English language is the law of the pevpie of the United States, and that although it was not written in the statutes, It was indelibly written on the pages o? American history, and that the man who would seek to change the language in oflit! documfjitij must first change existing li4 w. He was sure that if a provision to print all documents in German had been put in tl bill, it would go out mighty quick on a point of order, and for that reason he held that the rummittee provision which merely directed the public printer to take heed to the old standard did not constitute any change whatever in existing law. It was a inert: direction to the public printer, a mere Instruction to that official to guide him in liis work. M r frumnflPlfAr CUP crttai or? tn flan rirAO. I vcnor that the provision mentioned certain j standard dictionaries, and suggested that this was not the English language, which he held was established by usage by the foremost literary men of the country, but merely compilation of such usage. "Whom do you me:in by the foremost literary men?" asked Gen. Grosvenor; "this new-fangled spel ing board?" "Oh, no." replied Mr. Crumpacker. "I mean such men as Thomas Jefferson. George Washington?" "Washington never could spell," cried Gen. Grosvenor. amid general laughter. Discussion of the point of order was continued in the most lively fashion on both sides of the chamber, Representative DeArmond of Missouri being the principal democrat to defend the President's action and to assail the attitude of the committee. The discussion waa a-o<n?r ahead with great vigor when The Star's report closed. House Votes to Adjourn December 20. The House today adopted the concurrent resolution to adjourn for the Christmas holidays on December 20. to reconvene January 3.

Emergency Hospital. f] In fact the condition of the patient is A said to be so critical that he is not ex- b( pected to live through the night. Those gi who have seen the wounded man say he is slowly but surely passing away. Mr. Brown, who has shown that he is possessed f of wonderful vitality, rallied somewhat about noon today as the sun reached the t zenith, but it was said to be but temporary. and with the coming of night, with Its c darkness and depression, It is feared, the worst may happen. v Dr. William P. Carr. chief surgeon of the t; Kmergrncy Hospital staff, had several con-> ferences last night and today with Dr.r ? White and other physicians In reference to the wounded man. T Assistant United States Attorney J. C. ? Adkins called at the hospital shortly after E fi o'clrck last evening with a stenographer a to take Mr Brown's anti-mortem statement. According to the hospital physi- E clans the patient refused to make a statement, and. not realizing his critical condi- T tion, requested Mr. Adkins to call today. Mr. Brown had been unsconscious since n last evening and had not recognized his J son and daughter, who were at the bedside. Children at Bedside. Among those who called at the hospital B to see Mr. Brown today were his daughter and his son, who were permitted to go to his bedside; several senators and representatives and a man who gave his name as John Cameron and said he was a brother-in-!aw of the former senator. C; Miss Brown, the daughter, was almost in r a state of flervous collapse as a result of ,j fatigue and excitement and strain which she has been under. The alarming period was reached last night, when the wounded a man's temperature went up to 102 and his s pulse to 152. A telegram was received at the hospital t last night from Mrs. Annie C. Adams, mother of Maude Adams, the actress, requesting to he notified at the Grand Union Hotel, New York city, of the condition of a former Senator Brown. Baggage Sent to Prisoner. X "Mrs. Bradley must expect to remain o here for some time," was the remark mode e at the house of detention this morning when the trunk, suit case and satchel of tbe o prisoner were delivered there by an express- tl man. n The brown satchel is the one in which a Mrs. Bradley brought the revolver here h and from which she transferred it to the P red handbag after she reached the hotel, tl It was stated tfiat the handbag bad not Y> been placed in the trunk, but that it had d been Kept Dy tne ponce witn me letters taken from the prisoner. Mrs. Bradley had been advised of the serious turn in the condition of the wounded man, and. it was stated, she was an object C of pity. She had spent a restless night and she took nothing but liquid food for breakfast this morning. After the arrival of her trunk she was kept busy arranging c heer clothes and examining them. She saw Attorney1 Leckie during the early morning hours. Attorney Robert W. Wells calling 11 later. r Shortly before Attorney Wells called at the hospital Detective McNamee and Police e Photographer Dandberg called for the purpose of taking a photograph and thefinger u prints of the prisoner. The latter was con- ti suited by the matron and she made known s her objection to posing for a photograph. r Declines to Be Photographed. "I have been advised to do nothing without consulting my counsel," she stated, "and h that is the reason why I object to such a li thing being done at this time. I have a picture that wag taken some time ago that I am perfectly willing to give you." Mrs. Bradley denied published statements \ to the effect that she had cried when she was advised of the sudden turn in the condition of the wounded man. She made no effort to deny that the news had affected a her. however, and the change in her con- ll dltion since yesterday was noticed by those t who called upon her today. 1 "But," a friend of the woman who vis- . lted her this morning said, "she is holding , up remarkably well, and she intends to l' make an effort to remain aa composed v when she hears the news of the death of c Senator Brown." Mrs. Bradley realised this morning that f! the former senator had only a short time * 11.K.. ? altn t i_ iu live, uut. one uiu uui uionc aa many inquiiies about his condition as she did yes- ii toniay. To some of her friends who have t visited her during the time she has been l( under arrest Mrs. Bradley has expressed sorrow for the shooting. While, she says, 11 she realixes that she was wronged, she fails to find any consolation from her act. fl Too Late Too Becall Act. a "I know that' I had no right to take his v life," she Is reported to have stated, "tout h It Is too late now to recall the act." 1 After counsel had left the house of de- t tentlon Mrs. Bradley was again asked about s having her photograph taken, but she had T not experienced a clutnge of mind by rea- r .son of the visit from the attorney. She V said slie appreciated the fact th?t the po- v Ice authorities had made an exception in ler case in not taking; her to headquarters, hereby avoiding unnecessary notoriety, but hat under the circumstances she could ot consent to having her picture- taken, 'he police photographer was under orders ot to use violence, such as is frequently sed In cases of obstreperous prisoners. It was stated about noon today that the ]ndit!on of the prisoner was much im roved and that she was not much worse IT than she was yesterday afternoon. It i feared, however, that she will break awn when she hears that her act resulted i the death of the former senator. Mrs. radley.

Supposed to Be Wealthy. None of the Utah people who had called nd shown any interest In Mrs. Bradley as had a good word to say for the injured lan. "Senator Brown," as he is still illed by the people in Utah, is reputed toe wealthy. His friends in this city, it is tated, have always had an idea that he as a man of great wealth, but it was said >day by a man 'from Utah his principal roperty consists of a ranch in Idaho and magnificent residence on Brigham ave ue. Salt Lake City, which is the fashionble part of the city. "Nobody can deny, however^ that he has lade large sums of money," the Utah man lid, "for he was involved in most of the ig mining deals in the west years ago; ut he spent his money freely." When Senator Brown went to the repubcan convention held at Philadelphia, 'hich nominated McKinley and Roosevelt, e took Mrs. Bradley with him and enterlined her with a number of friends, but ne friends, it is stated, had no knowledge f the relations existing between them.

NEW YORK, December 12.?Try as they will, Walthour and Bedell seem unable to make up the lap they are behind the other twelve teams that remain in the bicycle race at Madison Square Garden. Both Walthour and Bedell are considered among: the fastest bicycle riders in the world, but the other riders in the race have thus far been able to hold them. Thto may be due in a measure to the fact that for the last twenty hours Bedell ha9 been suffering from indigestion, 90 that his stomach has not been able to retain solid food and as a result he has not been able to do himself full Justice. Today, however, Bedell felt better and was able to eat a chop. With renewed strength he and Walthour may And that they can gain the desired lap. SAf nrnvni Wild. The riding of Walthour and Bedell has been the feature of the race up to this time. Twice during the night they set the crowd wild with determined sprints to gain the lap, and once, early today, they nearly succeeded. Bedell started the spurt and gained nearly a quarter of a lap. and then Walthour picked up his mate and continued the race. Round and round he rode, gaining gradually but surely, but just as he seemed as If he would catch the flying bunch ahead of him Hollister's wheel wobbled and Root ran into him, causing a spill. Under the rules governing a fall, Waithour's effort did not count. Disappointed, but still determined, Walthour gave up the attempt for the time. At 7 a.m. today the twelve leading teams had scored 1,019 mites and 7 laps and Walthour and Bedell one lap less. This is nearly seventy-four miles behind the record of 1 (1IW ?

ALLEGED IMPURITIES CHARGE THAT FLOUB IS INFECTED WITH INSECTS. Drastic measures are to be taken by the Commissioners to improve the storage and sale of flour and other cereals in the District. Especial attention will be paid to | flour, as the Inspector of flour of the Dlsj trlct has reportpd^that this food commodity ts being sold in fchortrwelght measures, and, worst of all, that m Inspecting flour which has been in storage during the summer months he discovered the presence of many worms and insects. He reported that in separating 200 barrels of flour which had been carried through the summer months, he found enough worms and bugs to fill two large preserve Jars. Most of these insects were alive, according to the Inspector. He stated that the machine used In most of the bakeries to sift flour Is intended only to crush the lumps of flour. By this procedure, he says, the worms may be crushed into the flour and Baked into bread that is served up to the public. He stated that some of the smaller bakeries have no fa cilltles lor tne proper ana cietuuy storage of flour. "In one bakery," he reported, "I found that flour was stored in an unoccupied horse stall, next to a stall which was occupied." He said It was not necessary to make any comment as to the healthy state of this flour. Inspector Urgently Needed. The inspector of flour works, under the supervision of the sealer of weights and measures of the District, and Sealer Haskell has reported to the Commissioners that there is urgent necessity for an Inspector to do nothing else but inspect cereals, and for the enactment of such laws as will protect the public from short-weight flour and those selling and using impure flour. "I am of the opinion," Col. Haskell said today, "that in respect to flour which Is found In such an impure state the matter should be under the supervision and scrutiny of the health department of the District. I have recommended to the Commissioners that the flour inspector be placed under the immediate supervision of Health Officer Woodward, and that the sealer of weights and measures have jurisdiction only in so far as the weight and measure of flour is concerned. I am fortified with the necessary laws to protect the public from short weight." Fearing that the above proposition would not meet with the approval of the Commissioner, Col. Haskell submitted the draft of a Hour bill, the provisions of which will regulate the sale and storage of flour In the most stringent manner. Referred to Health Officer. Before acting upon this matter the Commissioners have referred It to Health Officer Woodward to determine the steps to~be taken at once to remedy these alarming conditions reported by the flour Inspector, and to advise the Commissioners if the present laws are sufficient to correct the condition.

CUTS MOTHER MELON Another Issuance of Great Northern Stock Announced. 600,000 SHARES OF STOCK Allotment More Noteworthy Than the Certificates of Interest f N VALUES APPROXIMATELY OF $130 Stockholders of the Company Have Beceived This Amount in the Last Month.

The proposition is to issue 600.000 additional shares of capital stock, to be replicas of those already extant.

This allotment in some ways Is more impressive than the certificates of interest in royalties to be paid to the Great Northern, by the United States Steel corporation. One remarkable feature of the plan for the issuance of the new stock as above is the length of time in which payments may be made?namely, from January 7, 1907, to April 7, 1908. The value of these rights, it was said this morning, was about $37. As the ore certificates are selling in the "neighborhood of $84, the stockholders of the Great Northern Kailway Company will have received within the last month rights of a total value of approximately $130. The circular letter referred to above is dated December 11, 1906, and Is as follows: "The continued rapid development, par tlcularly In the past year, of the business of the section served by your system of railways has created a marked public demand for increased and Improved transportation facilities. Increase of Capital. "To pay for the additional equipment for additions to and improvements of existing lines, and for acquisition, by purchase, of their securities or otherwise, of such other lines as your directors may decide to be necessary to meet this demand, requires an increase in your capital. "Tour directors have therefore adopted resolutions, subject to your ratification, providing for the issuance at par of 000,000 additional shares of capital stock of $100 each, similar in all respects to that now outstanding.

PORTER'S ODD STATUS UNRECOGNIZED BY REPUBLICANS, HE REPUDIATES DEMOCRATS. la Representative-elect Peter A. Porter of the thirty-fourth New York district a democrat or a republican? This may seem to be a question that ought to be very easily answered, but it is likely to cause Mr. Porter a lot of trouble before it is solved. On the unofficial roll of the Sixtieth Congress Mr. Porter's name is carried as a democrat. He is bringing pressure to bear to have it transferred to the republican list, where he claims it belongs. He has not succeeded, however, and it is said that he will continue to be classed as a democrat until he personally appears in the House and denounces the party which first nominated him for Congress. The democrats, on their part, will not give up without a struggle their prize, for as such they regard Mr. Porter, and will Insist that he remain tagged as a democrat, whether he votes with them or not. For the present Mr. Porter is said to be practically a political orphan, or a man without a party, as he repudiates one and Is repudiated by tne otner oia-nne organisation. Mr. Porter is the gentleman who beat Representative Wadsworth for Congress In a district that had been republican from time Immemorial and after Mr. Wadsworth had served eighteen years in Congress. It .will be recalled that Mr. Wadsworth had a little "run In" with President Roosevelt over the meat inspection question in the last session, and his friends say he suffered the fate of several other public men who have taken issue with the executive. Mr. Porter was nominated for Congress by the democratic convention on the same day that Mr. Wadsworth was nominated by the regular republican convention. He subsequently got the nomination of the Hearst people, the Independence League. Still i later he passed around a petition and secured a nomination as an Independent. Having thus corralled all the elements In the district antagonistic to the regular republican organization, he prosecuted bis campaign and won on election day. He was undoubtedly elected by the antireguiar republican organization, but is new claiming allegiance to the regulars. It will 'make some difference ta Mr. Porter, for unless he is a republican he will not get .any patronage in the organization of the .'next House. i BELMOinffl 

RICHES, He Discusses Problems Grow ing Out of Accumulation. SUBJECT OF IMPORTANCE I Government by Injunction Another ^ Burning Subject for Discussion. ADDRESSES CIVIC FEDERATION ' Doubts if It Would Be Advisable to Have Compulsory Investigations of Industrial Disturbances. * NEW YORK, December 12.-With wellnigh 250 persona In attendance, including | suuie ui me Dest-Known men in all walks ] and professions of Hfe, th? National Civic I Federation began Its flfth annual meeting < today in the Park Avenue Hotel. Among j t??ose present were Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius N. Bliss, Oscar S. Straus, Nicholas Murray Butler. Archbishop Ireland, Bishop i Potter, ex-Gov. I>avid R. Francis, Henry Phipps, Clarence H. Mackay, Samuel Gom- ' pers, John Mitchell, the Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden, Clark HoweH and James < Speyer. : The meeting was called to order by Au- ' gust Belmont, president of the federation. , In his opening address. Mr. Belmont urged the appointment of a committee to Investi- 1 gate the problems growing out of the accumulation of great fortunes. This subject will be considered tomorrow under the title of the income and Inheritance tax. "No subject can bring greater good to this country if correctly solved," said he. "or greater harm if for -wise and Just taxation punitive spoliation and the destruction of our boundless spirit of enterprise through hampering regulations be substituted. Government by Injunction. "Government by injunction is another burning subject that is to be discussed. When our worklngmen become Imbued with the idea that our courts are used by employers for partisan purposes, so to speak, it is a matter of great moment and worthy of the consideration of this body, and I hope some steps may be taken through tllA - - tuc mou uuicuuuiij' ui cms organization to help solve this apparently insolvable question." Mr. Belmont said he hoped committees would be appointed to investigate the savings banks system, building and loan associations, industrial insurance and old age pensions. Mr. Belmont said that he was not sure that President Roosevelt's proposition for compulsory investigation of Industrial disturbances is advisable. He doubted the wisdom of government interference, but the greatest Justification for such a jjolicy would be In the case of quasi public corporations. In the case of steam and street railroads the public would have a direct Interest in the controversy. n? ??* 1 

WI1UUU1HUUUS Ui wipiuu. Mr. Belmont also called attention to that portion of President Roosevelt's message wherein the President denounced the effort to prohibit all combination of capital. The federation then took up government by Injunction. Carl Spelling, general attorney for the American Federation of Labor, said that In labor disputes judges have sent forth decrees which wer^ special legislation and have paralyzed and rendered abortive all the evorts on the part of the labor side of that dispute. An injunction, he said, should never be granted except to protect property or property rights, and the courts have no jurisdiction to ever grant an Injunction except for that purpose. It was deplorable, said Mr. Spelling, that men should be advised to commit crimes, (but more deplorable If irresponsible men on the bench are to be allowed to "usurp au- ! thorlty above the law and become unrestrained despots, to take one side In every trade dispute, to decide ex parte that hundreds and thousands of men are about to ! violate the law, and send forth these special decrees .to paralyze and destroy the ' rights of all these men. I say that that Is ! the most dangerous tendency in our government. If these vicious and far-reaching ' precedents are to be recognized or permitted to go on building more on top of these, Liiey wui &uim uuuauiuic aim cicti a power as despotic as that which destroyed Rome."

ASSAULT TO KILL I (I I ALPHONSO M. NEWEIX ON TRIAL , IN CRIMINAL COURT. The trial of Alphonso M. Newell, Indicted for assault to kill Victor E. Adler, was continued today. The government abandoned <he Intent to kill count In the Indictment and elected to stand on the count which charges an assault with a dangerous weapon. Newell claimed self-defense. When the case was called for trial In Criminal' Court No. 1, before Justice Stafford, late yesterday afternoon, Julius I. Peyser, attorney for the defendant, moved il A. 4 \ I. V. ~ HJitL 111C llllU'lCllUCIlX ogaiusi ^CW041 uc quashed. Mr. Peyser stated to the court that, in his opinion, the facts in the indict- , ment are stated in an uncertain and indefl- i nite manner, and it should have been drawn in more definite and precise terms. Justice ' Stafford denied the motion and counsel for ] defendant noted an exception. The case then went to trial and the gov- ' ernment stated the circumstances to the Jury. It was claimed that Newell had been ' in the employment of Mr. Adler for about fifteen years and that he left his position last Easter on account of a dispute Newell had had with Adler. * J A.tAkn. *> * XL was anegcu liutl VCIUUCJ ox laoi iicncu visited Adler's store and demanded to see ' Mr. Adler.

He took Adler by the arm and shook him . violently and shot him in the arm. Mr. Adler testified to the shooting and exhibited the clothes which he wore on the , occasion In question, spotted with blood. One shot only was fired, he Bald. He was testifying at a late hour.

Later, when Newell was taken into custody, he Bald, he procured his release. After deliberation he determined to prosecute. Attorney Julius I.

PROBABLY ANOTHER LIST Railroads in Alaska Will Not Need Government Aid. rHEY FAVOE THE CANTEEN Board of Xanagers of Soldiers' Homes Urge Repeal of Provision Excluding Canteen. Senator* Aldrlch and Spooner of the Senate finance committee, accompanied bjr Secretary Root, conferred with President Roosevelt today about cabinet nominations that have been received at the Senate, and the failure of the last nominations to com Jly In point of form with prior nominations. In the case of Postmaster General Cortelyou, nominated to be Secretary of the rreasury, the finance committee found no Indication on the nomination as to when Mr. Cortelyou would assume the duties of that department. The conference developed the fact that the State Department, which makes out the nominations of cabinet ofll;ers, had failed to follow the form of other (rears. The fact that the State Department it tends to the clerical work of filling oat the nominations led to the presence of Secretary Root at the conference. From the White House the callers went to the State Department, where an arrangement will be made that will result In better information for the Senate committees in the future. The finance committee object* to receiving a nomination that fails to give the probable time when the appointee will take the oath of office. None of the cabinet appointments sent to the Senate furnished any such information, and the senators were rather positive that they could not do business without sufficient knowledge as to what they were doing. Mr. Cortelyou will become Secretary of the Treasury March 4, it is stated, and Mr. Garfield will enter upon his duties as Secretary of the Interior at the same time. It Is the Intention of Attorney General Moody, who will probably be confirmed today as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, to take the oath of office and begin his duties In the court December 24, the day before Christmas. Probably Another List. It was the impression among senators today that the embarrassment over the confirmation of the President's cabinet nominations will be ended by the President xuannik a utuiukc in me wording or nia sudmission of the names. The difficulty at present exists over the fact that the manner In which the names were sent in leaves the Impression that some of the officials superseded were dismissed, and also that there is an overlapping of dates. This can be remedied. It is said, by tha President sending another list to the Senate providing for all of the changes to take place March 4, and 6tatlng in language which will not be subject to equivocal construction that the changes are voluntary. It is thought that the opposition to Attorney General Moody's confirmation brought forward by some of the southern senators on account of his record in the House will not extend to the point of causing his re lection. It is thought that the appointments consequent upon Attorney General Moody's transfer to the Supreme Court would take effect as soon as the nominations are confirmed. but that the transfer of Postmaster General Cortelvou to the Treasury Department will not take place until March 4. Railroads in Alaska. Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania Introduced to the President today a party of capitalists who are interested in the construction of railroads in Alaska. They wers W. F. B. Stewart of York, Pa.; H. Baring, Wilkesbarre; A. J. Stewart. Mr. Hutchins and O. P. Hubbard of Alaska. They are stockholders in the Valdez-Yukon railway, which has long been seeking government aid for pushing the road. In the last session of Congress the House passed a bill looking to government aid for railroads. The President told his visitors that Gov. Hoggatt of Alaska had recently investigated the question of government aid and had reached the conclusion that private capital was ready to invest in roads without the government giving aid. He recommended that nothing be done. The President, who once thought the roads ought to have aid. is said to have changed his mind and to agree with Gov. Hoggatt, who knows the affairs 'of Alaska exceedingly well. A statement that Cardinal Gibbons would see President Roosevelt by appointment today was declared to be untrue. The Catholic prelate came to Washington on business, wit returned to Baltimore without seeking the President. Representative Pearre of Maryland lntr?> Suced James W. Buck of Kensington. They Favor the Canteen. The board of managers of the national soldiers' homes, headed by ex-Gov. Murphy jf New Jersey, called on President Rooserelt today to pay respects and to chat with !ilm. The board has been holding Its annual session in this city, considering matters of interest and Importance to the varl aus soldiers' homes, it was stated r>y several of the members that the board Is about to submit a report to Congress that strongly urges that the appropriations for soldiers" homes for the next fiscal year shall not contain any provision prohibiting the operations of a canteen. The board is unanimous in its conclusions that the provision passed at the last Congress excluding the canteen from homes from March 4 to July 1 was not such legislation as would conduce to temperance and contentment imong the old soldiers, and that no further legislation of this sort should be attempted. The board takes the position that th? sale of beer and light wines In soldiers' homes serves to keep the old soldiers in their quarters and prevent th?m seeking vile and poisonous drinks in other places, tt is declared that the light drinks in moderation do no harm and tend to temperance. Special Japanese Message. On the 18th of this month President Roosevelt will send to Congress as a special message the report he received from Secretary Metcaif on the Japanese situation in California. It Is not known whether he will transmit the report without comment or whether he will take occasion to say some Interesting things. The understanding now is that the report will go in without comment. The first bill President Roosevelt has signed at this session is one providing for the use of certified checks to secure compliance with proposals and contracts for naval supplies. ? Representative Burke of Pennsylvania, who is a member of the House committee an military affairs, talked to the Presiient today about ?ome changes In the physical requirements for entrance to the army. Mr. Burke thinks that It is unfair to reject young men from entrance to the trmy on the small excuses that are freluently given as applying to alleged physlaal defects. Governor-Elect Hughes in Town. Governor-elect Charles E. Hughes of New fork spent last night at the White House is a guest of President Roosevelt, leaving Washington before 8 o'clock this morning o return to his own state.
