SPIRIT OF JEFFERSON. CUARLKSTOWU, J?F?HHSOB COUNTT, W. Vil TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6. 1887,' Johann Most, the anarchist,. has been convicted,. The President's-message- Trill' be sent to Congress-to-day. The New York Gourt of Appeals has ordered a new trial for Jacob Sharp. Congress met yesterday. Neither Lucas or Faulkner sworn in, but their cases referred to the proper commit tee for consideration. A case is on trial in the United States District Court at Charleston involving the ownership of 50,000 acres of land in West Virginia. Ex-Senator Camden is of the opin ion that President Cleveland will be renominated without opposition, and tbat he does not believe tiiat any Re publican can carry New York. President Grevy on Friday sent to the Senate and Chamber of Deputies a message resigning the presidency of the French republic, and XX. Sadi Civrnot was on Saturday, elected Pres ident. The result of the election was received with satisfaction at home and abroad. The Democratic House caucus re nominated Mr. Carlisle for Speaker, and the Republicans nominated Mr. Reed, of Maine. Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Blount came to blows in the caucus. A. B. Hurt, of Mississippi, was nominated for doorkeeper of the .House by the Democrats. The dead body of W. C. J. Wej', a musician at the Virginia Military Institute, was found in a ravine near Lexington last week, with evidences that his death had come about bjT foul play. The coroner's jury ren dered a verdict that he was murdered by Jennie Brown, and that Ilarrj Brown, Chas. Morris and Mag Brown, all colored, were accessories to the murder. The recount of the recent vote of Virginia bj' the State canvassing board shows that the Legislature will be composed of 88 Democrats and 52 Republicans, giving the Democrats a majority of 30 on joint ballot. The Senate will be composed of 27 Dem ocrats and 13 Republicans, and the House of Delegates will have G1 Democrats and 39 Republicans.? The seats of two Republicans in the lower house will be contested by their Democratic opponents. The result of the canvass shows that the (whole vote cast in the State was: 119,380; Democratic majority, 426. The West Virginia State Grange P. of II., met in annual session at Alderson, Monroe County. Nov. 23d. There was quite a large turnout of members, and a large amount of bus iness of importance to the order was transacted. Considerable progress has been made in advancing Grange interests, since the last annual raect ing^and the State Grange, and the order throusrh the State, arc reported iu a better and more prosperous con dition than for several years past.? Martinsburg was selected as the place, and the first Wednesday in December, 18S8, as the time for the next annual meeting. Representative O'Ferrall of Vir ginia, in talking to the Alexandria Gazette's correspondent, said his feel ings were altogether in favor of nomi nating a Southern Democrat for Vice President on the next national ticket, but that he was not sure about the policy of such a nomination. Re specting revenue measures, he said he was almost sure that a reduction would be made in the revenue dur ing the coming session of Congress, and that lie thought that reduction would be effected by the removal of the internal revenue tax on leaf to bacco and the removal of the tariff on the necessaries of life. He says he made his last canvass on a reve nue tariff, and that the people of his district sustained him was proved not only by his election, but by the glaring fact that even the Milnes precinct in Page county, the manu facturing precinct of his district, gave him forty majority though it had previously given one hundred Republican majority. All the people wanted, he said, to make them tariff reformers, was corrcct information. Money to be Made. It is said that dull times are not known by the agents for the great publishing house of George Stinsott it Co., of Portland, Maine.? The reason of thin exceptional success is found in the fact that they always give the public that which is keenly appreciated and at prices that all can afford. At present we understand their agents arc doing wonderfully well ou ih;v cral new lines. They need many more agents in all parts of the country. Those who need profitable work should apply at once. Women do as well as men. Expcricncc is not necessa ry, for Messrs. Stinson ?fc Co. undertake to show all who arc willing to work, not hard bnt earnestly, the path to large success. It should be remembered that an agent can do a handsome business without bring away from home over night. Another advantage?it costs nothing to give the business n trial, and an agent can devote all his time, or only his spare moments to it. Stinson Co. guarantee grand success to all who engage and follow simple and plain directions that they give.? "We have not space to explain all here, but full particulars will be sent free to those wh'c ad dress the firm; their full address is given above. Washington Letter. Washington, D. C-, Dec. 2, 1887. Only a few more days and the mal lfcts will fall on Capitol Hill, the stars and' stripes will be hoisted to the breeze, announcing the birth of the First session of the 50th Congress opened ready "for business. The Senate and House have both been thoroughly renovated?new carpets, new furniture, desks revarnished, electric lights substituted for gas, and cverj'thing that goes to make a public office a public beauty has been looked after. Both halls arc as neat and clean as a newly made pin. Congressmen are arriving on every train, and it is expected that by Sun day night all will be in and ready for roll call Monda3r at noon. Tariff, Tariff, Tariff.?" What are your views as to the prospects for a reduction of the tariff this winter?" is the first thing that rings in a Con gressman's ears when he steps from the cars. The newspaper reporters are on the alert for these gentlemen, and it'? tariff this and tariff that, three times a day, breakfast, lunch and for dinner served with a civil service spoon, and such is the life of a Congressman. The Representa tives that have arrived up to date have all been interviewed upon this all important question, with but one exception;?Mr. Randall, whodeclines to speak at present?and all agree that there must be a reduction of the revenues this winter. Some are in favor of a- compromise, which is looked' upon as the only means of harmonizing the party. At present it looks as though Mr. Randall is go ing to fix things to suit himself, and which ever way Sammy points his fin ger, the wind is gofng to blow. Any way the men. who have been making the hard fight for tariff reduction are more hopeful than they have ever been before. Christmas.?It is nearing that time that every little child looks forward to with delight, Santa Claus' annual tour amongst the young folks. Big preparations arc being made by all the stores to furnish Santa with any thing that he may ask for. The big show windows on 7th street and Penn sylvania avenue, trimmed with all kinds of christmas presents, charms the eyes of the little ones, and big ones too. Each store tries to outdo the other, hence we are given some gorgeous displaj's in this line. Minnie Palmer.?The chief attrac tion at the theatres this week is the engagement of " dainty" Minnie Palmer at Albaugh's Grand Opera House, in " My Sweetheart," a charming musical fantasy in three acts,and Minnie's welcome to this city after a four years tour around the world was an overflowing one.? Crowded house, charming audience and beautiful flowers greeted her at every performance. She is light and as spry as a 16 year old girl on the stage, yet she is, I am told, nearing her forties. She has a national repu tation for her beautiful performing therefore criticism is unwarranted, and it can be undoubtedly said that Minnie is as sweet as ever. Doc. A Model Locomotive. Passenger engine No. S30, de signed by Mr. A. J. Cromwell, Su perintendent of Motive Power, Bal timore and Ohio Railroad Company, has recently been turned out of the Mt. Clare Shops at Baltimore and placed in service. The performances of the new en gine have fully met the expectations of her designer and he has been the recipient of many congratulations from the officials of the Traffic and Transportation Departments of the Road. No. 830 hauled Express Train No. 3, consisting of three sleeping cars, three coaches, two baggage ears, one express car and one postal car, from Baltimore to Martinshurg in two hours and fifty-six minutes, making four stops at stations. The distance is 113- miles and the running time was therefore, made at the rate of thirty nine miles per hour, an exceedingly high rate of speed to maintain with so large a train and over such grades as intervene between Baltimore and , Martinshurg. Two still more remarkable perform ances by the same engine were inade in taking Limited Express Train No. 5, consisting of one sleeping car, two coaches, one baggage and one postal car from Piedmont to Altamont, 17 miles, in 43A minutes, and the same train up Cheat River grade from a dead shot at Rowlesburg, 7& miles, in 15 minutes. The distances named arc all up grade, the former averag ing J17 feet to the mile, and the lat ter 105 feet to the mile. Engine 830 has four driving wheels, (JG inches in diameter; C3'linders 19x24 ; telescoped boiler, 53 inches at smoke box with 8 inch wagon top ; 174 flues, 12 feet long and 2$ inches in diameter; firebox 117 inches long by 34 inches wide, inside measure ment ; gross weight, with four gauges of water and ready for service, 102, 000 pounds; weight over drivers 70,000 pounds. From the Martinshurg Statesman : A son of Mr. John \V. N eer hurt himself quite severely with powder on Thanksgiving Day. He was out hunting, and game being scarce, he was amusing himself by firing squibs, and while pouring powder from his flask on to a piece of burning paper, it ignited and exploded the flask, burning him about the arms, breast and face. Ilis injuries, although quite painful arc not serious. On Wednesday the 23rd of Norem ber, George Ridenour a groom of two weeks, had an altercation with Mrs. David McBridc, and striking her in the mouth, knocked out several of her teeth. lie was arrested on Mon da}' last, and had an examination he fore Justice McKee, who fined him S10 and costs, which he failed to pay, whereupon, he was committed to Cas tle Dumford until payment is made.

Jennings Demorest, 15 East 14th street. New Tork. A New Swindle. The torn check swindle is being worked in some' parts of the east greatly to the sorrow of the victims of the scheme: This is the way th? thing is done. A check, say for S10, is obtained from a depositor at a bank, and n blank check exactly like the filted-in check is secured. Both checks are then torn irregularly across and in such away that the sig nature on the filled check appears on one piece and the amount and payee on the other. The check having been held together while being torn, i one piece of the blank check will ex actly fit the other piece of the filled check. The swindler then fills in one piece of the blauk check with the name of the payee and the amount to suit himself, takes it with the piece of genuine check containing the sig nature of the hank, and explains that the check was accidentally torn. The teller can put the fticces together and as they fit exactly the chances are that he will think that the pieces are parts of the same check and be come a victim of the swindle. Absolutely Pure.
