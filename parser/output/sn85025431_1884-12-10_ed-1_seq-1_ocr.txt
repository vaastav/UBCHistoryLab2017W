A dispatch from Lancaster, Pa., of the 29fch, relates the following: "The posse in pursuit of the thieves who robbed Bluffer's jewelry store at Bow mansville, last night, snpposed to be the Bnzzard gang, came upon them at the edge of a swamp, this afternoon, alter a chase of twenty miles. The thieves wepe four in number—Abe Buzzard, Joe Buzzard .and two others. They were fifed upon. Finally Joe Buzzard, cut off from the rest, was captured and lodged in jail. Since Wednesday night last, eighteen robberies have been com­ mitted in this immediate vicinity, in­ cluding goods ranging all the way from preserves to horses and wagons. Last night a horse and wagon was stolen from Bowmansville, after the thieves had got$l,000 worth of jewelry from D. B. Shiffer. The police force of this city were notified to be on the lookout for the stolen goods, and fifteen or twenty men of the vicinity, armed to the teeth and mounted on good horses, started early this morning for the mount­ ain, firmly resolved to capture the out­ laws or drive them from their hiding places. As they rode, one by one from their (farm houses they joined the pursuing, party until nearly fifty sturdy- men were in the avenging force. The pursuing party, comprising members of the Coar nornan and Honeybrook Horsethief Detective Association, all armed to the teeth, some on horseback and some on foot, followed the trail of the outlaws twenty four miles, where they overtook and fired three volleys at them, but without effect. The thieves made for Erutz's swamp, a tangled wilderness four or five miles in dimensions, and on the edge of it Joe Buzzard was-captured, after a resistance, and was disarmed of anew 32-calibre revolver. Abe and his companions plunged into the swamp and pursuit there was useless, as night was approaching, but the sturdy men resolved to stay on guard all night. Joe was brought to this city this even­ ing and was taken to the prison from which he was released from a four-year term on October 21, last. He was searched and placed in an iron-clad cell. He denied all knowledge of the recent robberies, and said he had been at his mother's in the mountain region. He had on new suspenders, shirt, stockings not yet soiled, and which it is thought will be recognized as a part of the goods recently stolen. The farmers have or­ ganized themselves into a vast vigilance committee, and are resolved to capture the outlaws or kill them.* LATEST MABKET REPORT. MILWAUKEE. Fiona—Patents, high grades.....

A special of the 4th says a fearful ex­ plosion of dynamite and gunpowder oc­ curred at the house of Stephen Young, in Stafford, New Hampshire. Eight persons were injured and four will die. Mr. Toung was having a well dug. A nephew, George S. Young, of Lowell, was showing how the dynamite charges should be used when one exploded. The ooncussion also exploded the remainder of the cartridges, and two kegs of pow­ der. The injured are: Stephen Young, George Young, a man named Berry, and one named Foss, a daughter of Mr. Young, Miss Sadie Greenfield, of Roch­ ester, and two others whoee names were not ascertained. Young's daughter and Berry are dying. Some of the others were seriously injured. The house and contents burned to the ground. SLAIN IN THEIR SLEEP. A Triple RTnrder Committed in a Georgia Village. Meagre details have been received of a horrible triple murder, on the night of the 2d inst., about five miles from Pelham in Mitchell County, Ga. The victims were Stephen Godwin, his housekeeper, Matilda Gregory, and her son, Richard. Gregory, aged 21 years. Nothing was known of the crime until the following morning when a failure on the part of the inmates to open the house, attracted the attention of the neighbors and led to an investigation. The corpses of Godwin and Mrs. Gregory were found stretched on their blood-stained beds, with their heads teiribly crushed and nearly severed from their bodies. All the ap­ pearances indicated that both had perished while asleep tutd that the bloody deed is the work of robbers who first chloroformed their victims. He Had Ketired. [From the Detroit Evening Jonrnal.j A politican and a quiet looking par­ son sat at a table in the Oris wold House dining-room last night. The politican turned to the unassuming stranger and asked: "What do yon think of the political situation?" "I have retired from politios. I never discuss it any more." "Retired? May I ask.when?" You may. I was out in Wyoming a month ago, and a. dozen cowboys and mjself were attempting to duouss the merits of the national candidates. I touched upon the brilliant war record of .. 5 *^w&i!C Logah, when a burly cow-puncher six feet fiveinterrnpted me by saying thai it was a lie Logan never saw a battle he was a horse thief up in the Laramie Oountry. "You denied it, of course?" The modest gentleman laid down his knife and fork, took a long draught of coffee, wiped his mouth, and then gaz­ ing long and earnestly at the'politician replied: "Stranger, if you should ever talk politios to a gentleman in Wyoming with a very strong aroma of bovine about his person, and he should assert that Arthur and Jesse James played poker together, or that Brighain Young and Henry Ward Beecher ran on a pres­ idential ticket in 1860, just agree with him and turn the conversation into other channels. Stranger, I am going back to Wyoming that's why I'mont of politios." SHOT ON THE STREET. Another New OrleanaTraaredy—Street Fight Among City Officials. On the afternoon of the 1st inst. Recorder Thomas J. Ford of New Or­ leans, shot and killed A. J. Murphy, workhouse superintendent. Mnrphy was superintending a gang of men work­ ing on Clairborne Street. He was sit­ ting on a door-step when two officers of Judge Ford's court approached on one side. While he was looking at them two men in citizens' dress, and one police officer came around the cor­ ner in the other direction and shot at him, each having revolvers. Murphy jumped into the street and finally got his revolver out and returned the fire. After emptying the revolver he ran around the ornerof Damaine Street, where he wa shot down and killed. He received five bullets, any one of which was fatal. All parties concerned in the shooting were arrested. A fEXAS "UNPLEASANTNESS." Two Citizen* HAe a Pow-wow With Pistols and Both are Killed. A dispatch from Palestine, Tex., un­ der date of the 3d, gives the details of a fatal encounter between Dr. Calhoun Lawrence and Lucius Y. Simpson, two prominent citizens of the town of Nech esville, twelve miles west of Palestine. The parties met on the. street and got into an altercation over a bill otthe doc­ tor. Hot words were followed by an appeal to arms, each drew a revolver and began peppering away at short range. Both pistols were emptied be­ fore the fight ended, and eveiy shot took effect. Simpson fell dead after the last shot, but Lawrence lived several hours. THE BOOMER DEAD. Capt. Payne, the Oklahoma Leader, firops Dead. Oapt. David L. Payne, the famous leader of the Oklahoma "Boomers," died suddenly at Wellington, Kas., on the 28th, while at breakfast at the Hotel de Barnard. He addressed a meeting the previous night and was seemingly in his usual robust health when he en­ tered the dining-room. While partak­ ing of breakfast, he was observed to lean forward and utter a subdned sound as if from a slight suffocation then he dropped from the chair to the floor and expired instantly. His sudden taking off created no little, sensation and pro­ found sorrow is expressed by his co­ workers and followers in attempting to settle in Indian Territory. LATE NEWS NOTES.

The Valuable Contents Entirely Do stroyed—Loss In Dollars Alone *2004000.. At 8:30 on the evening of the 1st inst, flames were discovered in the dor mitcries of the State University build­ ing, at Madison, and it soon became, ap­ parent that Science Hall was on fire. This was a magnificent stone structure, three stories above the basement, and 111 by 156 feet in area. It con­ tained all the scientific laboratories, apparatus and collections of the univer­ sity and was the best equipped institu­ tion of its kind in the West. At the time of its discovery, the fire was con­ fined to the engine-room, having prob­ ably originated from a forge which was being operated in the evening. The flapes soon spread to the roof of the wfrtfr" wing containing the machine shop, physical laboratory, draughting rooms and zoological museum. This wing, containing the instruments, col­ lections and records of priceless value, among other things the records of the United States Geodetic survey, and private observations of Dr. Davies, pro­ fessor of physics, was consumed. The fire department, a volunteer affair, seemed paralyzed, and could do nothing to stay the flames, and the entire build­ ing was burned to the ground in the presence of a crowd of nearly 10,000 persons. Among the irreparable losses sus­ tained was the destniction of the geo logical department with Dr. Irving's notebooks containing the observations of a dozen years past, and type speci­ mens of microscopic sections of rocks belonging to the university and to the geological surveys of the state of Wis­ consin and the United States. Lap ham's geological collection of 10,000 specimens, and Strong's of 3,000 of great value met destruction. The art gallery, of considerable value, was also in thisi wing. In the south wing, were the lecture rooms, various chemical lab­ oratories, assaying, zoological and others, and all were consumed leaving nothing standing but badly-charred stone walls. The building, including heating and water fixtures, cost about $100,000. Dr. Dayies' physical apparatus is valued at oveir $10,000, Dr. Birge's zoological de­ portment is worth about $8,000. It is thought $200,000 will hardly cover the loss. There is an insurance of $41,000, divided among a number of companies. FORTY-EIGHTH CONGRESS. Senate. MONDAY, Deo. 1.—'The only business of the session was the reading of the President's an­ nual message.

The committee rose and the bill passed, and the House resumed consideration of th0 inter-state commerce bill which went over.

(from the New York Sun.] Henry Orispen is a middle-aged Ger­ man laborer, and was employed until recently in a sugar faotory, but was thrown out of work by the factory suspending. He lives with his wife and three children in a poorly furnished top floor room on Attorney Street, New York. xHis youngest child is a girl, who was ushered into the world just be­ fore the sugar house closed, and when work was so slack that her mother had to toil energetically at washing and ironing to make both ends meet. Still she found time to manufacture a lot of baby clothes. She worked the ends of the sleeves beautifully, but her womanly solicitude was wasted, for the first discov­ ery the doctor made when he examined the new born baby was that it had no arms, and a further investigation showed that it had no legs. The father gave way to despair and readily accepted the superstitious theory of the poor people pf the neighborhood that the child was sent as a precursor of bad luck, though what worse luck they could have than they had already experienced the wife philosophically remarked she found it diffieult to conceive. Meanwhile the baby didn't seem to mind it at alL It grew fat and fair and saucy, and last night, until its wrappings were removed, it presented to the reporter the appear­ ance of a remarkably healthy, handsome and well-developed baby. Its face is dimpled andi very pretty, and its eyes are as black as does. The trunk, too, is plump and well proportioned, and on the place where the left leg should be is V' 4" a small toe, which will certainly be use­ less hereafter for the pnrpose of loco­ motion. A small, round lump, abont the size of a filbert, but indifferently fills the place of the right leg. The little shoulders are soft and nicely rounded, but one feels in vain for any indications of undeveloped arms. Life seems to be a perpetual joke to the little girl. Her face is wreathed with perpetual smiles whether awake or asleep. THE ACT OF A FIEHS. A New York Laborer Stabs Hie SicR Wife in tbe Eyes With a Slxoe maker's Awl. Matthew McCarron, a laborer, reded into his tenement on East Eighteenth Street, New York, at midnight, Thanks­ giving. His wife upbraided him for having left her, a sick woman, alone all day. The following morning the wife was found with terrible wounds about her head and face. She had been stabbed in both eyes. A bloody shoe­ maker's awl was discovered in a bureau drawer. McOarron had left the house after forbidding his wife to open the door. Her groans attracted the other inmates. The suffering woman told how her husband had assaulted her. She will be always blind if she lives. Mc ar ron was arrested, MISSED HIS AIM. Tbe Father of Zora Burns Attempts to Sboot o. A. Carpenter at Lincoln. III. O. A. Carpenter arrived at Lincoln, 111., from Dakota on the morning of the 2d. The same evening, as he was sitting in the office of Uriah Hill, on Broadway Street, W. H. H. Burns, the father of Zora Burns, passed by and saw him there. He went by the window and, turning toward the door, drew a large revolver from his pocket and fired at Carpenter. The bnllet struck the iron door post and glanced off doing no harm. Barns did not wait to see the effect of the shot, but walked auietly on around the square and went home. On the way he meta man named Primm, and said to him, "Well, I have killed Carpenter." Burns bas not been arrested. It is thought the old man's mind has been unbal­ anced by his trouble. Carpenter was very much frightened. It is about a year since his trial for the murder of Zora Burns took place. Since his ac­ quittal he has lived most of his time in Dakota. A NEW ORLEANS SENSATION.

A BIG VERDICT For a Crip pi [Engineer Against tbe Peunay 1 van ia^ tt ailroa At Youugstown, O., the jury in the case of Engineer Jno. Fitzsimmons, against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, in which he asked $50,000 damages for injuries received on the railroad making him a cripple for life, returned a verdict on the 2d, for Fitzsimmons for $27,300. The company at the time of the accident offered him $18,000 ior his claim, but he refused and last summer brought suit and secured a verdict for $26,000. The company asked and was granted a new trial with the above results. Hallucination. [From the Detroit Times.l "Hallucination!" said Dr. Jenks. "Knew a man once who thought his legs were made of glass. Lived down East. An old, wealthy, dyspeptic bach­ elor. I think the idea about his legs was the result of dyspepsia. Any­ way he was so afraid of having his legs broken that he cried ont whenever any­ one approached the bed. There was an old doctor in the vicinity, who was half mad himself, and this old fellow deter­ mined to cure him. One day he called and asked the old man to come out for a drive. Of course the old fellow was horrified, but the doctor insisted, and he at last consented to go. A bed was made up in the doctors conveyance, and the dyspeptic carried out and ten­ derly laid in it. They drove off and about, until over a hill a little distance off they saw the stage coming. Then the doctor by a dextrous twist of the lines, overturned the buggy and tum­ bled the old man out into the middle of the road. Of course he cried out that he was done for, but the doctor righted his buggy and drove off, leaving him squirming in the middle of the road, and quite unable to move, owing to his glass legs.. Suddenly he was alarmed by a shout, and saw the stage come tear­ ing down the slope, heading straight for him. He gesticulated, but the doctor had fixed things with the driver, and the stage came right along. Well, the old fellow stood it until the stage was only a few feet away. Then he jumped up and ran—ran clean back to town— and was never bothered with glass legs again. A Painter's'Models. A celebrated Abruzzese painter is about to put on canvas the character­ istic representation of a curious festi­ val held at a little mountain church once a year. Tile peasants walk in proces­ sion, carrying round their arms, waists, necks, etc., all the snakes they can find. Sig. Michetti, the artist, has a quaint little villa on the shores of the Adri­ atic. He was lately visited by a friend, to whom he showed all the curiosities of the villa, and then opening a small door into a dark chamber, into which he entered for a-moment,he called out: "I have something Still better to show you. Take these." The friend held out his aims, and to his horror five or six black snakes were put into them. With a cry of disgust he threw them to the ground. "How stupid you are," said Michetti. "You will make me lose all my models!" He then explained to his mend that he was making^ studies of life for his great picture. The curi­ ous festival, which is to be the subject of the painting, is believed by the peas­ ants to preserve them from poison and sudden death, and to bring them good fortune, especially in lova. A NEGRO at Bristol, Tenn., reached into a hole after a rabbit and brought up a bag containing $380 in diver. The way the Tennessee rabbit holes are now being reached after makes the farmers tired.—[Detroit Free Press. -i TESMB: TBE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. Beport of Hugh MeCulloeh, Secretary of tho Treasury Hlf Remedy for tho Stagnation Resulting bom Orer-pro dnetfoa Stimulation of the Foreign Trade Necessary—Tariff Charges Reo jf* WiiiuuniK, Deo. L—From the mass of figures •ubmltted In the report of Hugh MeCulloeh, sec­ retary of the treasury, It la learned that the total revenues of the government for the last fiscal year were 9848,519,869, and that the expenditures wen 1290,916,773, tearing a surplus of 157,603,396, of which 9M,000,000 bas been applied to bond re­ demption. The actual and estimated revenue for the fiscal year 1884-6 is WB0,000,000. and the esti­ mated expenditures are 9290,000,000. Of the reve­ nues expected during the eniralng year 9185,000, 000 will come from customs taxes and 8115,000,000 from internal revenue. The secretary estimates that the treasury surplus in 1886 will be not less than 950,000,000, and argues that something should be done to relieve the people of this un neccessary taxation. After noting the rapid£rowth of the manufact­ uring interests of the country under the system of protection and through tbe stimulus of war, mtil a point has been reached where the capac­ ity of the various manufacturing institutions far exceed the demand from consumers, the secre­ tary says: The all-important question, there­ fore, that presses itself upon tbe public attention is, how snail the country be relieved from the plethora of manufactured goods, and how shall plethora be hereafter prevented? It is obvious that our power to produce is much in exce»s oi the present or any probable future demand for home consumption. The existing iron, cotton and woolen mills, if employed at their fall ca­ pacity, could meet in six months—perhaps in a shorter time—the home demand for a year. It is certain, therefore, that unless markets now practically closed against us are opened, unless we can share in the trade which is monopolized by European nations, the depression now so se­ verely felt will continue, and may be­ come more disastrous." The secretary sees relief from this unfavorable condition of affairs in the increase of the foreign trade, and recom­ mends the appointment oi a commission to in­ vestigate the subject—a commission, composed of men not wedded to the doctrines of free trade or protection—fair-minded men, who will pros­ ecute the inquiry thoroughly, comprehensibly and Impartially. He says: "When the real con­ dition of our foreign trade and the character of the competition in which we must sooner or later engage are fully understood, it will be found that our inability to make that trade as free as our best interests require lies in the necessity which exists for heavy import duties, which, al­ though they may be levied for revenue only, must be in a laige degree protective. It is upon such taxes, therefore, that our government must mainly rely for its laige current expendi­ tures and the reduction or the national debt. Large revenues will be derived from the taxes npon whisky and tobacco, if the tax on the latter article should be retained, but our chief revenue must be deiived from import duties. To show how these duties may be imposed and distributed as to neither imperil our manufacturers nor ob­ struct our foreign trade, while the treasury Is kept in an easy condition, will be the task of the commission." Secretary MeCulloeh says the proposed commission should regard two points as settled: That the public revenues are not to be in excess of what may be required for the support of the government and the gradual reduction of the public debt that our manu­ factures, which, under the fostering care of the government, have attained such gigantic propor­ tions and whose prosperity is essenttal to the welfare of all other interests, are not to be put in jeopardy by rapid and sweeping changes in the tariff, and that all reductions of import duties should he' made with a view to their intimate ad­ vantage by opening to them markets from which' they are now in a large degree excluded. In view of the urgency of demands for relief, the secre­ tary recommends the removal of the existing duties upon raw materials which are to be used in manufactures. He says this can be done In the interest of our foreign trade. He [also recommends that the duties upon the articles used or consumed by those who are the least able to bear the burden of taxation should be reduced. This also, the secretary says, can be effected without prejudice to our export trade. "In regard to our internal revenue taxes," says the secretary, "I have to say that, as these taxes, with the exception of the tax upon whisky, ought not to be and will not be needed for revenue if appropriations are kept within reasonable bounds and rigid economy is estab­ lished in all branches of the public service, I see no good reason ior their continuance. 1 axes upon agricultural productions, althongh indirectly levied, are inconsistent with our general policy, and tobacco is the only one of these productions which has been taxed. An article which is so generally used, ana which adds so much to the comfort of tbe large numbers of our population who earn their living by manual labor, cannot nroperly be considered a luxury, and as the col­ lection of the tax is expensive and troublesome to the government, and is especially obnoxious and irritative to small manufacturers, the tax upon tobacco should, in my judgment, be re­ moved, The tax upon whisky could not be re­ pealed without a disregard of public sentiment, nor without creating a necessity for higher du­ ties upon imported goods, but while this is true the tax upon the alcohol used in manufacturing might be removed with decided benefit to home industry and foreign trade." On the subject of our shipping interests Secre­ tary MeCulloeh urges the prompt removal of the unjust tariff taxes which have driven American vessels from the sea and paralyzed ship building in this country. He does not, however, consider the restoration of our merchant marine an easy matter. We have been out of the carrying trade so long and foreign companies havie such enor­ mous capital invested that an attempt on the part of the United States to gain supremacy on the seas would meet with most vigorous competi­ tion. He deems government aid essentially nec­ essary, and unhesitatingly expresses the opinion that without it the foreign carrying trade will re­ main In the hands of foreigners. Secretary McCulloch's views in regard to the coinage of silver dollars are expressed in the President's message. He believes that unless both the coinage of silver dollars and the issue of silver certificates are suspended there is danger that silver, and not gold, may become our metallic standard. In conclusion, the secretary recommends that immediate action be taken by Congress relative to the basis of national bank circulation, now seriously threatened by the rapid call for bonds on which it is based, and that the system be con­ tinued substantially as it now is, except that the tax on circulation be repealed. «, A Yagrant Hangman. [Buffalo Cor. New York World.] John Greenwood, the man who has gained a reputation as the great hang­ man, has been sent to the Erie County penitentiary for twenty days on a charge of vagrancy. He is an Englishman, 38 years of age. He claims to have had the honor of putting the hangman's noose around the necks of more men than any other living man. Among the many criminals whom he claims the credit of executing was Carl Manke, the Alma murderer, who was hanged in jail in 1881 Pease, the celebrated burg lax, who murdered a man in Chibago. The last man whom he hanged was Luke Phillips, of Detroit, who shot his wife on a Windsor ferry-boat and was ex­ ecuted last June. Greenwood came to Buffalo when he heard of the West Falls murder case in hopes of getting the job of slipping the noose over the heads of Manchester and BandalL Since his arrival here he has been on a pro­ tracted spree and at last was arrested as a vagrant. During a conversation Greenwood seemed to be particularly desirous of im­ pressing upon his auditor that it re­ quired a of great nerve to adjust a hangman's noose and but few men craved the job. He said that he fre­ quently received as high as $300 for performing the work, and after that he generally celebrated the event in dissi­ pation until the money was gone. He seems to be delighted in being credited with the name of the champion hang­ man of the world, and watches all the papers very closely to keep posted on the murder cases in hopes of securing work. A Contempt for "Arrer"-Hcads. (Cor. New York Post.} "No there ain't many folks gits up here," said the driver, "'cause folks don't know nuthin' about it* much, and them that did got so plaguey fooled once that I reckon they never let on to try it again. How so? Wall, ye see, the heap has alius been kinder noted for the cur*us things they get out of it —Injun arrer-heads, stun knives, an' the like of that. But bless ye! a man had tor come'here and work like a horse to git 'em out. So it kinder struck one chap that he'd come here and collect a heap of stuff, and have it already for company when they did come. So he put up a shanty down here close to the mound, and after that everybody that went there bought arrer heads and bone things oheap as dirt, and all without workin' a bit.

But, Lor* bless ye," continued the[driver, snapping his whip, "they're just as good you can't tell the difference to save your life.
