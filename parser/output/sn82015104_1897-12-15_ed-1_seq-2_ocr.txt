Six months ago the "Record-Union" suggested that as the Federal Govern ment is the largest land owner in the immediate Vicinity of Yosemite Valley the Government owning all the land surrounding Yosemite, in what is known as the forest reserve, it would be the right thing for Congress to or der constructed over such lands a fine free model highway leading into the That idea grew into such proportions •that this paper was moved to set on foot a plan to bring the matter to the attention of Congress, especially as there was at the same time a scheme on foot to sell the four old toll roads lead ing into the valley to the Government for a round sum. Accordingly the mat ter was thoroughly explained in columns, and the aid of the press of the State was invoked to bring the subject to the attention of the people. When the subject had been well de bated the "Record-Union" sent out into the several sections of the State peti tions to Congress praying it to take up the subject and give it consideration, with a view to ordering such a free wagon road to be constructed over the easiest possible grade, and leading from the Yosemite Valley into the San Joa quin Valley, to relate it reasonably to the great lines of railway transporta tion in the State. These petitions, generously signed, were gathered in in November, and, be ing moFised, together with resolutions passed by several organizations inter ested in good road work and general Internal Improvement, were sent on to Congressman DeVries of this district, with a request that the same should be presented to Congress. Previously Mr. T>e Vries had heartily indorsed tbe plan ©1 this paper in the matter and gave it his earnest support and his personal assistance. It also received valuable Fupport from the State Department of Highways. The petitions have now been pre sented In the House of Representatives by Mr. De Vries, who will also intro duce a bill for inquiry to be made into the whole matter with a view to pre paring the way for practical action by Congress at as early a day as is pos sible. In a letter to the "Record-Union" on this subject Mr. De Vries, referring to the petitions sent up, says: Your favor of December 2d, with the Inclosed petitions, at hand. I shall present the same in the House this morning and know they will be of great •weight in determining this matter. I c.m now working on a bill to present to the House, which, I think, will be sat isfactory to all parties concerned. My bill will be in the nature of a bill for <the appointment of a commission to be composed of two United States en gineers and one member of the Board of Highway Commissioners of the State of California, who shall find all the facts In relation to this matter. That Is, their duty will be to find the length, width and grades of all of the roads leading Into the Yosemite Valley: the distance from stations or other points of the proposed new roads into the valley, together with the possible at tainable grades and widths of such road*, in fact, all of the facts relating to this matter. I will have a HI! fram ed that this commission is to act during the summer and report in tlm» for the short session of t<"> act there upon. Congress certainly will not act In the premises ■without information placed before it by its own agents, and I believe this will be the most satisfao -1 y way. Wh'm this data is before < which this commission will g.-i'her, and Is submitted before the peo ple as their report, I anticipate there will he no trouble in determining upon I. best route in the intemst of all the That Congressman De Vries Is correct J:i his ;udpment that no action can be exreeted of Congress concerning this f Yosemite road, in advance of offi cial inquiry and report upon the sub ject, tlsere can be no doubt. He has pursued the proper course, and we an ticipate that he will be successful in nttainirg the e-nd so much desired. In trie meantime effort in the direc tion already taken should not cease. Friends of the proposed road should not allow any opportunity to pass unim proved to influence Congressmen favor | ably towaids the plan. Many such op portunities wiH present within the next I few months. The "Record-Union" is gratified at the success that has thus ! far attended the movement, in the in augura'ion of which it played a part. The press of the State generally has ' approved and commended the plan : many of our contemporaries placed the "Record-Union" petitions in their offi ces for signatures, and others engaged the personal services of their managers and editor's in circulating the petitions among the people. All such have the j proud satisfaction of knowing that their I disinterested and public spirited labors I have not thus far been in vain, and ! that there is the strongest of probabili i tit s that at a reasonably early date they will see the final results of their unselfish endeavors in the construction of the much needed highway by order of the Federal Government. The thanks of the people are due to Mr. De Vries for his prompt and vigor | ous seconding of the movement, and j for his unsolicited pledge to do all that j can be done honorably to carry It through to successful and early accom plishment. 

THAT TROUBLESOME TARIFF QUESTION. : The fiery speech of Count Goluchowski has stirred up the mugwump and op , position press of the country greatly. The Count proposes a commercial war against this country, and such papers ;as the New York "Post" and New York : "Times" pretend to feel great fear that | such a war will be inaugurated, and t that in consequence we will severely i suffer. Perhaps it would be just as • well that such a war should begin now, ;if ever, since until we have a practical itest of the matter we shall be bothered i with the persistent meanings of such papers, which insist that we have set up the most exclusive system known outside of the confines of China, There is nothing like experience as a teacher, after all. The "Post" declares that our system is made up of hostili i ties, and the "Times," with equal j gloom, expresses the fear that we have | exhausted our powers for the injury )of industrial Europe. Of course, the United States may have made a mis take; of course, bur reciprocity scheme I may be a delusion and a snare; but we I apprehend that we will never cease con j tending about them until we hay« had teaching experience. We have been | disposed to think that European states • men are disgruntled because America j has been growing so fast and mani festing independence of capacity. That iwe are becoming self-dependent ap ! pears to us to be the chief European j charge against us. We have thought • that the United States has been at ; tending strictly to its own business, ! and that if European States combine jto wage a commercial war upon us ; they will be the chief sufferers, in the I present condition of their social sys tems, which do not appear to be able !to stand the strain that such a con i flict would impose upon them. However, we repeat, if we are ever to get the tariff out of politics and settle upon a stable and non-disturb ing system, it will be done not through political revolutions every four years, ', tearing up the business of the country. ; unsettling confidence and disturbing. ; not to say paralyzing, industry. It will come as the result of the greatest and most effective of teachers—experi • ence. The proposed step for a Tariff Com- I mission, by the way, is one that can ido no possible harm. It is worth try j ing. Upon that it would seem that Ithe most extreme protectionist and the ; most radical free trader can unite. But to that scheme these same objectors to '■ our present system raise the loud-veiced objection that it is un-American, would j strip Congress and the Executive of all j dignity and power, and reduce them |to complete insignificance in the pres i ence of a commission empowered to fix : duties, change them from time to time, ! adjust classifications of imports, and ; reporting to the President require of ' him the issuance of a proclamation to the effect that the edict of the commis : slon is law, and after thirty days to be respected as such. We confess that *he proposition as J now formulated does look somewhat i like stripping Congress ac the legisla i tive body, and the President as the Executive with a veto power, of their constitutional rights and duties. How ever, the present plan for a commission maybe, will be, modified. It is possible to name a commission that will search out and advise correction of any in : equalities in the present system, and suggest changes as are needed. Such a body properly constituted would, we think, command the respect of the ! people, and would probably be an effl ! cient force In pushing us on to that ; permanent settlement of the tariff - ion, that every interest, indus j trial, commercial and social, demands. j Because the President recommended ;in his recent message several needed changes in the civil service law, the opi>osition press is shouting through its sensational trumpet that the McKinley j Administration is undermining and : sec-king to overthrow the entire civil ; service reform system. Let not spoils- I men profess concern for the system. There is nothing they would like bet i ter than to see it overthrown: but no , Republican administration or Congress Will over have that crime laid at its 1 party threshold. An inquisitive and impertinent ex ga asks if ever yet there was framed In any nation of this round '■ globe a tariff bill that met with the approval of the New York "Evening P it"? That is easy—never. Even ! reciprocity according to the latest ex pressions of that journal is an abom- The President of the London Board [Of Trade says the rapid decline in Brit ! ish exports is due to American com i petition. Thanks, for so much of con ! feision. 

SACRAMENTO DAILY RECORD-UNION. WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 15, 189 T. VOICE OF THE PRESS. EXTRACTS FROM EDITORIAL 1 EXPRESSION. i ■ — State aud Coast Opinions on Sub jects of Living New* Interest. Stockton Record: The Merced "Sun's" j anxiety 'to create a Democratic-Popu- \ list-Fiee-Silver-Repubiican trust for the campaign of 1890 seems to meet j with opposition. It goes to the length of saying that devotion to principle suggests to Populists the expediency of j working for success by "whatever means." This is very candid and ex- . I plains the "devotion to principle" With a nicety of language that admits of no j mistake. HE WHO GOES OUT. Bakerstield Californian: The Stock ton "Mail" suggests that an ordinance j { that will reach the man who goes out j | between the acts would be about the ! i proper thing. It would indeed, and a reasonable line for breaking it would rapidly fill the coffers of every munici- j polity in the State. THE POOR FARM. Tulare Register: The Colusa "Sun" objects to calling a poor farm a poor farm because some people wouid have to go there for shorter or longer per iods who are really not to blame for becoming public burdens and then they ought to be helped to earn their liv ing ever, there. It must be allowed that there is something in a name and that no discredit ought to be attached Ito one who is made a public charge j through no fault of his own, but it is j not easy to suggest a name that will ; | take away from the sensitive and self- J respecting soul the sting of accepting j alms and to those who are not self respecting the term "poor farm" will j have no terrors save in the in force d I labor which the term may come to i imply, THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW. San Diego Union: There is little ! doubt that during the present Congres | atonal session a determined effort is to be made by the spoilsmen in Congress to nullify or actually repeal the civil Kir vice law. The outcome will be j awaited with the keenest anxiety by thousands of people all over the coun- | try, who believe in clean politics and would deplore as a backward step a return to the system in vogue only a few years ago. The law which it is now p.'oposed to nullify, is the result of earnest work by some of the coun try's best men. THE ILL 

ODORS AT IONE. Stockton Independent: Superintend ent O'Brien of the Preston School of : Industry has resigned, and the public j will probably never know the exact i j truth about the stories of brutality and ' | mismanagement. Dr. O'Brien is quot- I jed as saying he must be vindicated by i ! the Trustees or his resignation "doesn't 1 ! go." Of course he will be vindicated. That has probably been all arranged j ' m advance. To those who suggest i ; that to vindicate him would be incon- | i sist -nt the answer that inconsistency 1 j would be nothing new or strange to ; i them would be sufficient. He has been \ I "vindicated" most vindictively, and j j any further vindication will probably be of the same kind. The programme t includes the return of Tim Dee to the position which he recently resigned. O'Brien is to be vindicated; Lee is to !be vindicated; Trustee Tyrrell is to Ire j I vindicated; everybody is to be vindi- | j eated, and all concerned will be popu- i ; tarly regarded as afraid to do anything j [ but to vindicate everybody and every | thing. While this farce is being played I the Trustees, Superintendent O'Brien ! and Governor Budd will Hatter them selves that the public will be satisfied ' I because unable to see through the fog \ \ they have raised around the reforma- '. I tory scandal. The people are begin- ' I ning to believe the stories of both par- ! | ties to the scandal, and conclude that j , neither dares to have a full and com- i j plete investigation. The lone instltu : tion i 3 an example of a public charity | demoralized by politics. THE FULL SHEAF. Stockton Mail: We have no patience jat all with the intolerable cant which lis newr so happy as when death fur ; nlshes it a subject for maudlin bab- I Ming. Death, when .it comes peace- I fuiiy and naturally to end a long and ! good life, is not at all an awful thing, j I Neither do any of us who are baoyed ' tup either by religion or philosophy, sor- | | row as those who are without hopa' ; when the loved one goes away into the \ unknown country. The outward signs ' lof ostentation? grief, the black robes, the costly mourning—'these things har- j montse neither with religion nor with sense. NO DEFICIT IN PROSPECT. Maryeville Appeal: A good deal of! distress has been felt in the minds of ■ | Democratic editors for the past few ;' | days over the fact that the estimates Of the Treasury Department sent to ) Congress at the opening of the session ' Indicates an apparent deficit of f2L> -647,885 during the fiscal year which ends June 80, IV.)<>. it is proper to i say, with reference to this estimate that a recently enacted law requires the War Department put into its estimate for the expenditures of the ! coming year all estimates made by sub ordinate officers, or needed expenditures upon the river and harbor works where they are employed. The result of this is that the estimates for river and har bor improvements alone, amounted to 965,406,400, which, of course, is from i.n ty to fifty million dollars more than will be appropriated for that purpose. Notwithstanding the fact that these figures were excessive, the Treasury Department was compelled under the law to include them in its so-called es timates, knowing full well they were absolutely excessive, and that the ap- | propriations for this work would fall prooably .*.")o.<HN>.(><»<► below the figures named. These circumstances account for the fact that the official figures es timate an apparent deficit of $21,000,-I OuO, when In fact, it fc*-expected that there Will be a surplus of at least that i A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. j San Jos ■ Mercury: The movement started by Washington for a great na tional university at the capital of the Country is finally assuming definite shape. This speedy nation always does things with a rush, and it has taken only nbout a hundred years to make a start in the direction of carrying out Washington's idea. It would not be surprising if the grounds were pur chased and all of the buildings con structed long before the end of the ORIM HUMOR. Oakland Times: Tie re is a sort of grim, very grim, humor in the fact that the envoys representing the Spanish rnment who go to Cuban insur (its to carry the autonomy proposi tions never come bark. Some of them , are said to remain to fight in the in \ Burgent army. As to what becomes of the others, the results of an inquiry might be unpleasant to admirers of the i insurgents. PENSIONS AND PATRIOTISM. Biggs Notes: Now that Congress iis again in session, one of the I questions that affects a large J majority of our best citizens !is that of pensions. The thousands ! who are now on the rolls of the Govern • men< at from $6 to !>'_'o per month, did not think of these tilings when in 'til j they left the farm, the store and the ! workshop to go forth and battle for the preservation of our Union. These men I were young then and the going into the i service of their country was the purest !of patriotism. Now they are old and , many of them have but this small sum given them by the Government to tide them over until they are mustered out ! of the world by death. As the American puts it, the question of pension payment receives little con- I sideration on one of its most important safest. We hear much about the extrav j agance of our pension appropriations, but few seefn to consider that such ap j propriations are not only a remem brance of a grateful nation for past services, but a carrying out of the prin ; ciple of "in time of peace prepare for war." These expenditures now made ; may result in great saving in some fu ture hour of trouble, iEL DORADO CONGRATULATIONS. Mountain Democrat (Placcrville): We j congratulate the "Record-Union" on the ■success and popular indorsement of Its gallant fight for the Folsom road, ! which may serve as a model beginning lof good roads throughout the State, i Although not so near to our heart and . home, we also hope that its scheme for a Yosemite driveway for the tourists of ; the world may be equally successful, jlf the United States Government had half the esthetic taste and good sense that we have, a national road to one of its most magnificent resorts, would be ' a foregone success. THE FOLSOM ROAD. Placer Representtfve: Last Saturday j Sacramento County voted 8 to 1 to is sue bonds to build a boulevard from ! Sacramento to Folsom. This is one 'of the most progressive steps ever |taktn by any community in Northern I California, and the example set by the ! county will undoubtedly have a good j influence upon the whole northern part of the State. The Commissioners who will have : charge of the work are reliable business \ men and promise to see that every dol lar Is as judiciously expended as it ■ would be if expended in a private en | terprlse. If they do this, Sacramento \ County will never be sorry for the step ■ taken last Saturday. The Folsom read will usher in a new 'era of toad building in California. The present method is unsatisfactory, ex ! pensive, and a continual source of an | noyance. THE 

IMMIGRATION BILL. San Jose Herald: The Senate will | probably have the immigration bill un i der consideration this week. It will ibe remembered that the bill passed at the previous regular session was ve j toed by the President, and that it could 'not pass over his veto. Peihaps it was ! just as well so, if not a little better, i The bill contained some provisions of '■ doubtful policy. j In drawing a bill which affects the ' rights of our neighbors of Canada to • come fnto this country' to work, it is j well to remember that such a rule will ' work both ways. For instance, the Ca- I nadians could make it very disagreeable j for Americans on the Klondike if it were to shut them out of our labor ! market. And they would be pretty apt ito do it. The Dominion Government has ; already shown considerable dispositi n j to set up the bars against us there, and was only restrained by argument found - !ed on considerations of international I neighborliness ami of sound policy. The effect of Canadians coming into i this country by the day or for other I brief periods, is a very small considera ! tion to the country at large. It affects ! but a few persons in limited areas, if jany. A general restridtion of the cheap i labor of Europe and Asia is earnestly jto be desired, but the Canadians are pretty much of the same condition as Ourselves and are no threat to general j industrial and social conditions. THE 

CASE OF CUBA. Santa Rosa Republican: The wisest men in our nation are in doubt as to the course that should be ! pursued in regard to Cuba. They are ! not sure in regard to what action in this ! matter is best for the Cubans or for our i own country- Some favor recognizing ' the independence of the island, others i would grant the insurgents belligerent rights, and yet others would take no decisive step at once. It is plain that : President McKinley does not desire to 'involve the United States in war with Other nations. The conservative busi i ness interests of the country* and cool | headed men generally are with him on this ptoposition. In such a contest we should have everything to lose and j nothing to gain. Of course this is not satisfactory to ! the jingoes—the men who do most of the talking at all times but are sure to shun battlefields when war Is on. They |wi uid defy all Europe at any time for i the purpose of making themselves ; ' spectacular. War wffcb. the mouth is ! their forte. • * * j But cooler headed people wouid have their country resort to extreme meas | urts that would call for a struggle at j j arms as the very last extremity. They j ' would first employ all the arts of di- | plomacy. Know ing that our country j has no responsibility for existing condi ttons in Cuba and doubting the ability of the people there for self-government if given their independence, they are disposed to be cautious and conserva ! tive.
