Upwards of 3,000 delegates are this week attending the National Rivers and Harbors Congress in Washinglon, among them several delegates from the lower Rappahannock. Seven Gov ernors of States are also among the delegates. Ambassadors of foreign countriea are among the speakers. On and after Saturday, November 30th, 1907, the daily service of the York Riyer Line between Baltimore, West Point and Richmond Va., wiU be dis continued, and, until further notice steamers will be operated on a tri weekly service, leaving Baltimore on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday af ternoous, and West Point on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons. A marvelous feat was accomplished with the ocean giant "Seuvic," that ran bows on upon a rock. About one third way back from her stem a bulk head was built across her whole beam; then the forward part was dynamited,' the stern shot back and under her own steam, assisted by tugs, was worked backward into port. There a new bow was built and added to the salved two thirds. and today she is as good as ever. The British steamer Thetis was sent out by the British govemment to lo cate a certain dangerous me.k on the C-Sf ?LIta1^ The captain tried jt ?w faded. He came home again, and the first lieutenant, who professed him self willing to make the effort, was permitted another voyage. He suc ceeded and when he came back he was promoted. The captain of the Thetis was angry, and in his rage he said; "It is a fabrication, and if ever I have an opportunity, I will sail over the place to provo it a lie." He was sent out to take the Uritish ambassador to Italy. Coming to the locality where the rock was marked upon the lieutenant's chart, he tried to sail over it. There was a crash and the steamer went to the bottom. The captain was drowned for his trmcrity. The man who will not believe because he has not seen may be m such a case.

More over, he is much more a Jeffersonian Democrat-Pittsburg Dispatch (Dem ocratic.) The Norfolk Ledger-Dispatch aays, **Mr. Jones, of Virginia, sounda the firat diacordant note among the few Democrata that are left in the Houae of Repreaentativea." Thia is because the First District Congresaman is op poaed to Democratic leader John Sharpe Williama* naming the Demo? cratic membera of committees. To avoid dissatiafaction he wanta speaker Cannon to name them. Senator Foraker announces that he is a candidate for President. He hopes to puncture the Taf t boom. He ex pects to force Roosevelt to run again or support Governor Hughes of New York for the nomination. The Supervisorship of Wicomico has kept all guessing. A recent return seems to give Mr. E. J. Carter 4 ma~ jority over Mr. Kent. 

DOINGS IN CONGRKS. Congress opened Monday. A number of bills have been intro duced seeking to restore "In God we Trust" on the new $10 gold coins. John Sharpe Willlama waa chosen Democratic floor leader in the House and Senator Culberson in the Senate. The Virginia delegation drew back seats. Congressman Hay got half way up the aisle, but the others were told to "go way back and sit down." Tuesday Congress listened to the rcading of the lengthy and not over powerful message of President Roooe velt, and adjourned for the day. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his recommendations for internal improve ments, advises $2,000,000 to be apent in Virginia, of which $75,000 is for the Rappahannock and its tributaries. 

FISH ANOOYSTER NOTES. While the oyster will spawn at the end of its first year, ic does not attaia fu!I growth until the end of the third year. Two year old stock, when large, is marketed. Some oyster houses in Connecticut and other northern states, ahippjag West, have shut down, temporarily, until the glut from the Chesapeake dredgers is over. A two-inch fish was found in a cake of ice harvested on the Hudaon last January. When taken out and thawed in a pan of water the minnow came to life and showed much agility. Artificial oyster beds were found in China before oysters were known to exist among Greeks and Romans. The Celestial knew more of oyster lore than Caesar or Alexander the Great. The U. S. District court at Wilming ton has decided that the fifteen boats of the Fisheries Company now in the harbor are to remain there until the claims of the seamen are satisfied. Eleven admiralty cases have been fded at Providence, R. I., against eleven vessels owned by the company at Tiverton. Judge Brown, of Provi? dence, has gtaated permission to the receivers to sell the property of the company. Direct reports from Pocomoke con firm the information from other parts of the coast regarding the vast im provement in the conditions of the oyster industry. In two years the system of protecting the rocks has brought a wonderful change for the better and the tongers and oystermen who were bitterest in opposing the new laws and regulations, seeing the practi cal advantages of them, are enthusias tic in praise of them. They join heartily with the State authorities in preventing the very depredations which two or three years ago they claimed the right to make. contending for that supposed right most bitterly. Now they see that those who wish to preserve and protect the oyster beds were right, and that tney themselves were wrong, and, as wc told them at the time, were standing in their own light and working against their own interests. We hope that, like sensiblemen, having seen bya practical experience that they were mistaken, they will turn in and give their influence, votes and efforts. not only to the ?>n forcement of the present laws, butto the enactment of cther laws for ^ preservation and development of the oyster industry.?Richmond News Leader. 

VIRGINIA FISHERMAN MISSING. Albert Morrls, of Reedvlllc. Dlsap pears nt Atlantic City. A telegram from Atlantic City states that Albert Morris, of Reedville, Va., arrived there Saturday. November 23rd, aecompanied by his wife, and twohours later went out for a walk and has not been seen since. He has been ill for some time from nervous trouble, and Mrs. Morris fears he has committed suicide. Mr. Morris is a wealthy man and con nected with the menhaden fisheries in Virginia. He was sent to the University of Pennsylvania Hospitalat, Philadel phia,by his physician to be treated fora nervous disease, and from there to con valesce in Atlantic Crty. Up to this tirae no trace of him has been found though the aearch ia being aystematically proaecuted. PEARLS FROM THE SHELLS. When we learn to use the elements to secure their aid in doing our work, propelling our ships, and in sending our messages, then civilivation has been made fully possible. Complexity of or ganization making a close dependence of all parts of society on all others, produces civilivation. There can, however, be no high civility without a deep morality, and on that civilization depends. We must hitch our wagon to a star and work for those interests which the divinities honor and promote.'' ? Emerson, fifty years ago. It always interests me towatch those moguls on the Sante Fe, pull and push their stringof cars up the Rockies. And I always think of the world's poor devils down at the foot of the hill. Ifa no trick to bring that train down, that one big question is to hold her back. But it takes two or three ten-drivers to put the thing on the crest of the range. uon t lorget that. The very reason so many fellows are yet far down the valleyis that they needaomehelp. After all, and in a very definite senae, you're to blameif the fellow staysdown. He'd pull the hill if he could.

If you tell a well man that his house h?.l burnt down and his family is dead he'll suffer just as much as though it were true until he finds out you were fooling him! Some folks live night mares, they live in fear of something all thetime;afraid of the future. Don't they know that the future is the result of the present?

Alnbama liquor dealers managed to prev.at local option from taking ho.d of the State, but the indignation of the people grew in leaps, and Iast week her legislature declared for prohibition laws throughout the State. The papers of Richmond are warning saloon keepers not to violate the laws or tfirow obsta. daa m the way of local option, or prohi? bition may likewise fall upon Virginia. An anti-treating and anti-credit bill will be introduced at the coming session of the legislature by W. E. Barrett representative of Newport News. Mr' Barrett has stated that the measure if enactcdlinto law, willprohibit a person treating another and atso make it un lawful for the keeper of a bar to credit a customer. Friends of the measure beheve it will prove a half-way step between the radical liquor legislation now sweeping over theSouthern States and the condition which now exists. In a lengthy address (with some strong points in it) to the people of Richmond, answering anti-saloon at tacks, the Liquor Dealers' Association of that city delivers itself _of this re markable clause: "We regret to see that politics are being so mixed with the church, but it does seem that such is the case. The liquor dealers have always been and are now a God-fear ing and law-abiding people; many of them are worthy mcmbers of churches, and certainly all of them have the high est regard for religion and the welfare of the community." The wisdom of the local option sys tem, which has obtained in Virginia for some time, is very clearly demon atrated by the trouble now prevalent in Alabama, where a State prohibition law has just been adopted. The senti ment inthecity of Mobile, which haa estabhshed one of the finest public school systems in the country by using theproceeds derived from liquor license, is violently opposed to prohibition in that city, and would undoubtedly if sub mitted to vote of the people "go wet," and yet under the general SUte law hcensed saloons must close their doors Indeed Mobile is so decply incensed at the necessity of closing her saloons without having the right to be heard upon the question, that she threatens to secede from the State. This is an unfortunate condition, and impresses one with thG importance of preserving the Democratic principle of local self government. -Free Lance. JAMESTOWN NOTES. Card passes- issued during the expo sition will be honored by the gatekeep ers until f,urther notice and any other person can enter the grounds as usual upon the payment of tifty cents. It will be a month before the great fair will assume an aspect of desolation. Many ppecial sales will be conducted in several of the buildings, and the ofli "als of tho ter-centennial company will bfl found at their dosks as usuitf. for a few days at least. GOVEKNMENT I.IEN ON THK EXPOSITION. President Tucker, of the Jamestown Lxpo.Mtion, believes that the400 acrcs comprising the fair grounds should be purchased by the United States Goverh ment for use as a coaling station for the navy or a naval training sehool. At the New Willard, Washington, last week he said he would not ask Con gress to make the purchase, but mere ly wished to make the suggestion. Ihe Expoaition ia in debt to the ex tent of $2.000.000," aaid Preaident Tucker. "Of this $400,000 ia in a firat mortgage, $700,000 ia in a second mort gage. and $900,000 we owe to the Gov ernment on the loan of $1,000,000 which was extended to us at the close of the last sesaion of Congress. The land on which the Exposition is held and the buildings thereon belonging to the Exposition company, are worth fully $3,500,000. If the Government shouldgive us $2,000,000 for this prop erty, it would get a great bargain and the company be enabled to pay off all its debts. No other Exposition has closed with such assets in real estate as we shall have at the close of the pres ent month. Most of them have been glad to come out even." 'How much money will the Govern ment be paid on its loan?" "I doubt very much whcther it will get any more money." "Will the Exposition be reopened next summer?" "That is now being considered, and I should not be surprised if it were." "In that case, will the Government get any money from a lien on the re ceipts?" "No; the Government's lien expires the end of this month. The Exposi? tion would be extended for the benefit of the creditors." "Has there been any miamanage ment in connection with the Exposi? tion?" "Perhaps some things could have been done better than they were, but as a whole the Exposition has been a success. So far as I know, all salaries have been paid." A 

BUZZARD IN PAJAMAS. Here is the opinion of a Baltimore bank official on the new $10 in-God-weS trust-less gold piece: "It is the ugliest coin that any Gov emment ever inflicted on a helpless people. On one side is an un-Indian-like Indian head, with something gone wrong with the nose. The face ia said to be modeled after that of a beautiful Insh girl. There is not an Irish girl on earth who wouldn't consider it an insult to be compared with the thing. 1 'On the other side is a strange beast in tended to represent the American eagle. It looks like a turkey buzzard dressed in pajamas. Its head is too small and its legs are too long, therefore the latter have been covered with pantalets. No icthyosaurus of prehistoric times was half as repulsive as this beast; no crudely modeled coin of ancient Babylon or Egypt was as ugly as this coin." Our gold coins have been the hand somest in the world. These new ones are the ugliest. There is good money in taking sub scriptions, if you have the time and will talk things up with your friends and the people you know. It will pay you to write for particulars.

S. Sena tor Arthur M. Brown, of Utah, at a hotel in Washington on December 8th last. Amid the applause of a crowd that fiUed the court-room, Mrs. Bradley, with tear-dimmed eyes, was diacharged from cuatody. Walking is the great panacea for all ills, according to the aged pedestrian, Edward Payson Weston, who made his second tramp from Portland, Maine, to Chicago. "To cure thebluea, walk" he says; "eat prunes every day, smoke good cigars or a pipe, and burn cigar ettes in a stove; eat what you want, as often as you want; let liquor alone; walk to and from work; go to bed early and take a cold sponge bath every morning and a salt water bath once a week." Len Bennctt, a twenty-year convict, was pardoned Thanksgiving morning for his good behavior during the time he has served. That morning he went to Governor Glenn's oflice, and with tears streaming down his cheeks, knelt before the Governor to express his thanks for the kindness done him. There are extenuating circumstances connected with the crime of murder for which Bennett was sent up that fully warrant the executive pardon granted him. A movement started in Colorado. where there is a colonization society for the purpose of seoding the negroes back to Africa, has been espoused by O. M.

The movement is de signed to ship to Africa all the negroes in the United States, in order that they may establish thcir own govemment; with an American protectorate. The worthless class of negroes are eagerfor the movement, while those who have accumulated property are opposed to going to a new country, where they will have to build themselves up all over again.

COMMUNICATION. Editor Citizen: It may not be pohtic to write the following but the writer f.M Is he is net constituted entirely diircrenL from the majority of Laneuster citizens, t-o he trusts this may be read in the spirit written. There bi ?. ? | ,f> of road about a mile from Whcalton, which since the organ ization of this piaee has been aeonstant source of annoyance and trouble to the people for miles back in the country? in fact to every one who might have anything to ahip from this wharf?a regular aink hoie, no bottom. Mr. John William Chowning has dis cussed, with the writer, what had bet ter be done as to fixing theae places. The discussionto the best of the writer's memory was a reasoning in a circle; "that it ought to be done, but ought it tobedone?" Leavingone underthe impression that if.some kind hearted fellow would fix it up at his own expense he would be al lowed the privilege, which is just what happened. Now I wish it understood I am not currying favor with Mr. Lank ford nor am I more afraid of him than Mr. Chowning; I fear neither and re gard each as a friend, or so far as I can judge. It istrueMr. Lankford is a MW comer and that Mr. Chowning is one of our trusted and honored citizens and herein lies the cause of the jury's de cision and I do not criticise this; I do not knovv who composed the jury, the blamerests on the Board of Supervisors. Mr. Lankford, a man in whom I have every confidence, a man whose word is hia bond, seeing the absolute r?eed of aomething tobetterthismiserable road, this much traveled road, accepted the commiasion from Mr. Chowning, we will say, to have shells put where need? ed, say fifteen dollars' worth on our main road. Suppose through a misun derstanding he did exceed the commis sion (and fifteen dollars in shells on our road is a clear lack of judgement and money thrown away) a proposition a man of Mr. Lankford's business ability and experience in road making would have never considered. Now Mr. Lankford did not furnish shells of his own, but believing he had the jftithority todo so made himself re sponsible for these shells and the labor necessary to place them. Now it is nudisputed that the county received the benefit; our people for miles have seen this road is not as it used to be. Aa thia is true the Board has failed to make good and pay a debt which through their own evidence and defense a jury does not hold them liable. I ex cuse the jury, but as a citizen condemn the Board. You repudiated this debt and leave an innocent party the bag to hold, a party who hari the honor thrust upon him, a new-comer, and it should be a warning to every citizen in this county to ha^e ? written contract with our Board of Supervisors orstand ready to take the consequences. Our taxes are high enough, our roads are bad enough, but I suppose in the course of events that ournoble ox team will again show its smiling face in our community and then like the shadows of the trecs again disappear to parts unknown. .i?ePK,.emen of the Board, you owe this bill,these shells have bcnefited this road more than anything ever done; you OUGHT to PAY! I feel this matter deeply, because it comes close home to me, and if Mr I.ankford"had not accepted the respon sibihty, I would have done so. With no suggestion from any one with no apologies to any one, this is wntten, and if neceaaary I shall tr0 deeper mto the road problem of this county, a discussion and airing might be of some benefit and help dry the rowk.
