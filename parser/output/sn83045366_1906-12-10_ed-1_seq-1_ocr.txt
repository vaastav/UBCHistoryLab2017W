INCREASE IN SALARIES ASKED FOR THOUSANDS Efficiency, Not Deficit, Governs His Actions, Says Post master General. -8 ONE CORTELYOUISM Nearly two years of adminis tration confirms me in the opin ion that the postmasters of the country should be appointed by no party primarily as rewards for po litical activity, but primarily on the basis of fitness for the work and regard for the wishes of the communities they serve. I know of no one thing that will do more for the postal servico than con tinued insistence upon the policy of substituting business for poli tics in the administration of its af fairs. George B. Cortelyou, Postmaster General. In his annual report. Bpeoial to The Journal. Washington, Dec. 10.Against a deficit of $14,572,584.13 in 1905, the annual report of Postmaster General George B. Cortelyou, given out last night, shows a decrease to $10,516,- 995 94 in the fiscal year -|ust closed. Re ceipts of $152,826,585.10 for 1905 are eclipsed by Mr. Cortelyou's figures of $167,932,782.95. With the proiect of a Chicago man to give the postal business of the United States into the hands of a pri vate corporation, and thus escape the annual deficit, before him, Mr. Cortel you says: I repeat what I said a ea ago that while it would be a gratifying circum stance if the postoffice department were belf-sustaining, I am less concerned about the deficit than the efficiency of administration. By a proper system of accounting, the department can be placed upon a better business footing and Inci dentally credited with work for which it now receives no credit. And as a result of these and other needed changes the deficit, which is, in fact, only a paper defi cit, can be altogether eliminated. Prog ress towaid these improvements will open the way for investigations to de termine the feasibility of the adoption of many important policies of administra tionreduction of postage, both domwic and international, postal savings banks, parcel post, postal telegraph and tele phone, and othersthe merits and de fects of all of which should have in the not distant future the fullest consid eration. Urges Salary Increases. Of chief interest among the recom mendations of Mr. Cortelyou is his plea* for increased salaries in the postal service. Good men are leaving the service, he says, because the rate of pay is far below that given employees of the same relative worth in private service. Then, he adds, the salaries paid are too small to induce an influx of compe tent men sufficient to meet the de mand. Postoffice clerks, railway-mail clerks, city and rural carriers and fourth-class postmasters are included in the plea for increased salaries, with the increase in the cost of living, the good of the service and the increases granted employees of railroads and other large corporations as arguments.

STORER SAYS HE'S NOT AN ANANIAS Sticks to Contention that Presi dent Changed Front in Ire land Affair. (President's reply to Bellamy Storer's charges in relation to pro motion of Archbishop Ireland will be found on Page 4.) Cincinnati, Dec. 10.Bellamy Storer, former ambassador to Austria-Hunga ry, today replied briefly to the state ments contained in President Roose velt's letter to Secretary Boot, which was given to the press last night. Mr. Storer insists on the position he has heretofore taken and reiterates the as sertions made by him in the statement to the members of the foreign relations committee of congress made public last week. Mr. Storer says: I seem to have been elected a mem ber of the 'Ananias club' like all others who have come into dispute with President Eoosevelt. I am now to be classed with Senators Chandler, Tillman, Bailey and with others who have questioned some act or word of the president. Like every other Ameri can gentleman, who has a wife to pro tect, I undertook to defend her name from insinuations and charges of falsehood. Mr. Storer says he has four let ters bearing on the controversy as to the promotion of Arch bishop Ireland, all of which tend to bear out his contention that he obeyed the explicit instructions of Mr. Roosevelt, Continuing, Mr. Storer saysi Archbishop Ireland tola me also that the president on several occasions in conversation with him took the cred it for the action he now repudiates." Mr. Storer continued in part as fol lows: The crux of the whole matter which led to my removal was the action taken by Mrs. Storer and myself with regard to the promotion of Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul to the cardmalate.

Chicago, Dec. 10.An unknown girl has entered into, the Vrsal poisoning case, opening up a line of inquiry into Herman Billek's career that-led the police back five years, and may unveil a series of deaths similar to that which followed in the train of the arch wife murderer, Jokann Hoch. Billek is held charged with complicity in poisoning the Vrzal family. Lieutenant O'Brien has received in formation that five years ago Billek was present^ at the death of a young Bohemian girl whom he had induced to believe that he would marry, despite tm? fact that he had a wife and chil dren. This girl, according to the police in formant, had money, and the relations between her and Billek had progressed to such a stage that they went to a South Halsted street to pick furniture, for the home they establish. Fell Dead in Store. While looking, over furniture, the girl dropped dead. Her death was laid to heart trouble and stomach disorders, but the symptoms, as tar as the police have learned, were identical with those displayed by the six members of the Vrzal familv, who have died since Bil lek became the "family friend." These further facts in connection with the Vrzal family have been pried out of the various witnesses: Billek at one time worked in a chemical shop in Cleveland, and was acquainted with the uses and natures of poisons. Gave Pills to Vzrals. He gave pills to other members of the family who died, besides the father, Martin Vzral, and the girl Mary.

Will Study Conditions and Report to the Commission at Min neapolis Hearing. Bepresentative Thomas F. Marshall of North Dakota was in Minneapolis today, en route to investigate the crop tieup conditions in his state at the re quest of the interstate commerce com mission. He has already hundreds of letters in his possession from grain growers and shippers in the congested territory and will devote this week practically to seeing what his constitu uents have to offer in the way of sug gested remedies. He expects to be Minneapolis next week, when the com missioners are here from Washington to conduct their first -hearing on the car shortage. "The commission regards the fact of the blockade as already well estab lished," said Mr. Marshall to The Journal today." And while its hearings will necessarily bring out that fact, the idea is to get down to the basic facts and develop the reasons for the conditions in the congested area. One most interesting line of evidence will be that bearing on discrimination between competitive and non-competi tive points. I have in hand many re ports which show that competitive points have this year received as many cars as usual, while from non-competi tive stations come reports of wholly in adequate shipping facilities. If dis crimination be absolutely proved at the hearings, the shippers will be in a fair way to secure speedier relief than oth erwise, for the situtaion is a new one and the powers of the commission are not well defined when it comes to han dling the general condition of question of car service. The handling of dis crimination, however, is already pro vided for in present laws. Service in Canada. "Another line of information which the commission wishes to develop is the service granted to Canadian grain growers in contrast with that accorded to producers in the states iust this side of the boundary. Some of the reports that have come to me state that the Canadian shippers are supplied with all the cars they need by the same rail roads which on this side of the line have permitted grain to pile up in use less heaps. It is no doubt true that Canadian gram shipped thru the United States in bond has been moved prompt ly, but that does not necessarily signi fy, inasmuch as bonded grain has to be moved out forthwith under the regula tions of the customs department. If there has been discrimination on other than bonded grain, however, the com mission wants to know it." Mr. Marshall will leave this evening 1u& home at Oakes, N. D., and will make th at town his headquarters for trros of investigatfrm to cover the week. In the otheshrppin lines of infor are being developed by other agents of the interstate commerce com mission. H.
