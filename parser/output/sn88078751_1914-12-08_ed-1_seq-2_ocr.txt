RUSSIANS CLAIMING VICTORY Early Fall of Cracow, Now Invested by the Czar's Legions, Not Antici pated by British Military Experts. "Battle In Western Zone Reported to Be at a Standstill Australian and New Zealand Troops Arrive. London, Dec. 5. According to un official dispatches from tho Russian capital, the battle of Lodz has ended In success for the Russians, but this statement Is opposed to that of tho Berlin official report, which says tho German offensive In Poland is talcing Its normal course. Tho fact Is that the fighting In this region has developed Into such n Jum ble that It Is almost Impossible to fol low It. Tho most Important factor, from tho allies' point of view, Is that tho German advanco on Warsaw seemingly has not succeeded In Its object, nor has It had the effect of di verting the Russians from their for ward movement through tho Carpa thians and on to tho plains of Hun gary or against tho fortress of Cra cow, around which they aro drawing a closor ring of men and artillery. Taking Into consideration tho rase of Przemysl, which has held out so long against -the Russian attacks, mil itary men do not look for tho early (all of Cracow and are rather Inclined to bcllevo that the armies of Emperor Nicholas will endeavor to keep tho large Austrian forces inside the for tress and enter Silesia from tho south east. Much. depends, however, on tho bat tle which is bolng fought with such Intensity farther north between tho rivers Vistula and Vrtho, and In which all agreo tho 1 uses on both tides have beon very heavy. Tho battle In tho west appears to be at a standstill. Tho allies and tho Germans have attempted to take tho offensive at different points along the front, but as neither claims to hav3 made anyndwtnee and as both official reports montlon repuIscR of tho en emy, It Is evident that the attack which have boon made have not mot with much success. Tho nrrlval of Australian and Now Zealand contingents In I'gypt on forty transports is quoted as another tri umph for tho Hrltlsh navy. Tho Gor man cruiser Hmdon was not far from this flcot of transports when she was overtaken and destroyed by tho Au stralian cruiser Sydney.

NICHOLAS Day Is Observed In Holland On Sunday Amsterdnm, Dec. 5 No festival In Holland exercises a more enchanting spell over both old and young than tho Dutchman's "Feast of St. Nicholas." Tho Jolly old patron saint of children corresponds in Holland to our Father Chrlstmns though coming threo weeks tarter, on the blithday of tho old Spanish bishop, which falls on Dec. 0. Tho feast of St. Nicholas has Its puthetlc side this year, for, while tho children aro to gather this evening to elng tho old songs and welcome tho coming of Santa, their elders are pray ing that tho efforts of tho good Queen Wllhelmlna to Induce the warring na tions to accept peace may result in tho restoration of happiness through out stricken Europe. Tho queen has sont a message by tho American min ister to President Wilson at Washing ton, and tho good people of Holland are hoping Hint something can bo done. Tho original custom was for the children to place their llttlo wooden hoes upon tho hearth on the eve of St. Nicholas Day, tho legend being that on that night the holy man rode over tho housotops on a snow-white steod accompanied by his llttlo black servant, a Moorish negro. "Slnta Klaus" waB supposed to cai ry with him a largo bag, full of toys and sweets of nil kinds for the good children, and riding over tho roofs he throw tho presents In passing down tho chimneys into tho shoes below. After him camo tho llttlo black boy carrying a birch rod as a souvenir for tho very naughty ones. In tho early days, the evo of St. Nicholas was given over to tho chil dren entirely, but by degrees tho grown-ups have come more and moro to share In It, until now In Holland it Is a great gathering for big and little onus alike. People sond presents ono to nnothr, and a good deal of teasing people about their pot weaknesses is Indulged In. St. Nicholas Day Is for all Dutch children a day of tremendous excite ment, of dlternato hopes and fears (the latter for tho naughty boys with n wholesome dread of the rod), and nil that day they can tnlk of nothing elso but "Slnta Klaas." As a rulo din tioi Is taken an hour earlier than us ual, and after tho meal Is eaten a cosy led cover Is spread ovor the ta ble, according to tho old Dutch cus tom, and all sit around the table, tho biggest children being supplied with scissors to cut tho strings for tho pnrc'els. The father then says: "Childieu, I think St. Nicholas may bo hero at nny moment; lot us Blng him a llttlo song that he may hoar you aro all good eh Ul reu and aro oxpoctlng him." Whoioupon, all lights aro tinned down and In tho fever of expectation tho llt tlo ones chant some quaint old song, Whllo thoso songs nro being sung, ono hears a ling at the door boll and a nhullllng of feet on the thieshold out Hide iinuouiiccR that ut last tho groat moment hns arrived and old Fathor Nicholas mid his llttlo back boy aro bore. Stops aro heard along the pas Kiigo, and thou In walks tho good old paint himself, u vonerablo, white bearded mnu, clad In a long flowing lobo of rod or purple and loaning heavily upon his golden staff. His mantlo Is trimmed with golden em broideries, and ho wonrs n goldon mitre. Sllonco falls upon every ono; men the children aro too overwhelm ed by the solemnity of the moment to chatter. Ah lie oiitors, ho holds out u bund, first to mother and then to fathor and clasps them both; then ho asks them If nil tho children have been good throughout tho year, and calls each child by nnmo to come and sluilto Lands with him. And It Is Indeed n marvellous thing how St. Nicholas scorns to know all of their llttlo faultH and fallings, and very ofton It has a crv pood effect on tho children whou he tolls thorn how It grieves him when they aro naughty. The black boy con coals his birch rod and upoiiH tho bag, and tho piosouts aro handed round to each and all, but not till St. Nicholas has gone away aro tho lights turned on and tho presents, oxamlnod. Then tho chldron are hurried off to bod, tired and happy, after which tho oldortt gather for their own colebra tlon. ,

ROCKEFELLER'S MESSAGE READ iried Operators to Get In Good Graces oi the Public; SENSATION AT THE HEARING Dispatch Made Reference to an Arbi trary Settlement Plan Advanced by Colorado Mine Owners Through Governor Ammons Introduced For Purpose of Impeaching Rockefeller's Testimony Before Committee. Dener, Dec. G. A telegram from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to Jesse F. Wclborn, president, and L. M. Bow ers, chairman, of the board of Colo rado Fuel and Iron company, created a sensation at the hearing of the fed eral commission on Industrial rela tions.

Rockefoller, Jr., Eh en before the congressional com mittee, denjlng that he had any ac tive connection with the operators' conduct of the strike. The telegram made reference to an nibltrary settlement plan which had been advanced by the operators through Governor Ammons and Rock efeller concluded by saying: "It seems to us that the operators should call Dr. Foster's attention (meaning Representative Foster of Il linois) to these facts and reiterate their willingness to accept this settle ment. By so doing they will place themselves In a very strong position before the public in that It would be 6vldont that all dlsordertlplnce Nov. 27, has been duo to the refusal of tho union to accept the settlement which was proposed by tho governor nnd ac cepted by the operators, hut i ejected by the miners. Unless In tho mean time there has been an important change In the situation, ns stockhold ers and directors wo strongly urgo that tho opciators make reply to Dr. Foster nlong these lines." Former United States Sonator Pat terson concluded his testimony by making a strong plea for a compul sory arbitration law, intimating that tho operators by refusing to meet tho men In conference considered that all men nro not born equal. He said such a law was necessary to bring tho op erators to their senses.
