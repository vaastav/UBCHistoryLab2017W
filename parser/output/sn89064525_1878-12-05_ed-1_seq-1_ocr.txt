The St. Paul Globe of Friday last contained two letters from persons jrho had served IQ the State prison ft* StWk water, and an interview with William Hannegan, of Minneapolis, who served as prison guard in that institution (or some time. The statements of these men are similar to the statement of Patrick Coffee, referred to in our col­ umns last week and, if true, the man­ agement of the Stato prison is abomin* able. Mr. Hannegan refused to give a detailed statement, however, for the reason that there will probably be legal investigation, and he preferredi to make his statement before a legally authorized tribunal. According to the allegations of the persons mentioned above, as long as a convict is gfjod health and works faithfully for ihe in­ terest of the contractors, or has influ­ ential friends outside the prison, he is well used but if he happens to be out of health and is unable to do the work required, there is no mercy shown lum. Our readers are doubtless aware that the labor of the conviets is sold to Sey­ mour, Sabin & Co. According to the statements made, the most cruel abuses have been practiced in the prison for years. For trivial or imaginary offenses men who were unable to be very useful to the contractors, were thrown into the dungeon on a diet of bread and water, or no diet at all, for protracted periods of time. For any degree of insubordination the guards and keepers would begin to persecute a convict without mercy, until the man would actually expect to be mur­ dered. Coffee's assertion that one of the keepers applied croton oil to his (Coffee's) back for the purpose of making a painful sore and putting him in as much misery as possible, is also affirmed by other «enviets who were in the prison at that lime. It is stated that frequently a convict who is so unfortunate as to be disliked by the keepers, is punished for being sick} or, what is equivalent, is punished for not being able to do the work that a healthy man could do. We are of the opinion that tSte State prison needs a thorough investigation. The St. Paul Globe. The St. Paul Giobe is worthy of commendation for giving publicity to the complaints that have been made about the- management of the Minne­ sota State prison at Stillwater, and the asylum for insane at St. Peter. The man who becomes a convict in the State prison usually loses his friends, and is at once stamped as an outcast. No confidence is placed in his word, no appeal of his can reach a sympa­ thetic heart, and the abuses and craej ties which may be heaped upon hiin must be -endured, with no friendly hand to administer consolation or give relief. And when his term of service expires and he is again a free man. even then he finds it impossible to get a hearing, for he is only a '-State prison bird," and nobody believes him The newspapers reject his statement, because they would lose money by in­ curring the enmity of the persons ex­ posed. This is one of the difficulties that the poor and obscure will always find in their way when they seek re­ dress for the wrongs perpetrated by rings and corporations. Money con­ trols everything and the poor wretch who seeks to expose an influential ring, is dismissed at once. His right to a hearing is measured by his capac­ ity to pay for it. Last winter, when several persons who had been employed in the asylum for insane at St. Peter formally alleged that abuses existed, the testimony of these persons was discredited. It was said that they were only seeking revenge for having been discharged from employment at tbe asylum. But the Globe insisted on having a thorough investigation, notwithstanding the threats made by some of the interested parties to hegin a libel suit against that paper. A Senate committee was appointed, a careful investigation was had, and last week the committee made their report to Gov. Pillsbury. It appears from their report that every one of the alleged abuses did actually exist that "gross carelessness, cruelty and inhu­ manity" was practiced, in at least two instances resulting in the death of the patient that unauthorized and extrav­ agant expenditures were common that $26,164.36 in scrip, bearing 12 per cent interest, had been issued by the trustees without any authority in law that the accounts of the asylum had not been properly kept $ and that the books show a deficiency of $4,024.75, the examination of said books having been made by Henry M. Knox, public examiner, and three other experts. But as bad as the fi­ nancial management of the asylum has been, the "gross carelessness, cru­ elty and inhumanity" practiced tow­ ard the patients is far more reprehens­ ible. The insanity of the victim makes redress impossiblej and if his insanity happens to be of a nature that gives offense to the attendants, he be- comes the object of their wrath and persecution. As stated above, we de« sire to commend the Globe for espous­ ing the ?ause of the unfortunate men and women in the asylum and the State prison. The President's Message. The last session of the 45th Con­ gress commenced on Monday last, and the President's annual message was delivered on the same day. We pub­ lish tha message in full on the second page. The President is very careful to commit himself to nothing, and to eonceal his opinions in a web of words. If he has any opinions on any of the leading issues, he fails to express them, except in a very equivocal manner. No person can reasonably complain of the tone or sentiment of the mes­ sage, for it has but little of either. That 50 000 Acrea. The sale of 50,000 acres of railroad land, which was advertised to take place in St. Paul, Nov. 27th, was com­ menced on that day at the State cap itol. When Kavanaugh, the auction­ eer, was just getting ready to begin the sale, Gen. John B. Sanborn, the attorney of the Western Railroad Company, stepped forward and read the following document: 

"GENTLEMEN: For and on be­ half of the Western Railroad compa ny of Minnesota, and as its attorney and agent in this behalf, and by its direction, I give notico that all the lands offered or to be exposed for sale at this time and place, are claimed by the Western Railroad eompany of Minnesota as equitably belonging to said corporation, and to be subject to a lien and charge to said corporation for their full value for the completion and equipment of said line uf road from Watab to Brainerd, and that the Western Railroad company of Minne­ sota has brought suit in court to re­ strain this sale, and to have its title and interest in said lands adjudged and deereed to be free and clear from all liens, and that suit is undetermined and wi'.l be prosecuted to final judg­ ment, and that notices of lis pendens have been filed and recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the respective counties where these lands lie, to save to the company any rights that may be adjudged to belong to it in said lands in said action or any ae tiou connected therewith." It was, therefore, understood tlmt whoever bought any of the lands would find it necessary to defend his title in the courts. The most of the lands were hid in by B. B. Eaton, agent for DeGraff & Co.. at. prices ranging from 10 cents to SI.55 per acre. The sale was not finished on Wednesday, and was continued on Friday, at which time B. Eaton bid in a large portion of the lands offered, though several sections were bought by L. Christian, about 4.500 acres by J. [I Davidson, and a small amount by other parties, the prices being about the same as on Wednes­ day. Anti-Drive Well Association. On Friday last a number of gentle­ men from different parts of the State, organized a State Anti-Drive Well As­ sociation. Among other proceedings the following article of agreement was adopted The undersigned associate them­ selves together as an organization to be known as the Minnesota State As­ sociation, for the purpose of resisting, by lawful means through the United States courts, the pretended claim for a patent on what is known as the "Green drive-well." For a temporary association, until all portions of the State ai*3 represented, we will elect a president, secretary and treasurer, and also appoint a central executive com­ mittee,in numbers at the discretion of the associaion, the duties of this com­ mittee to be the general business and correspondence necessary to secure co-operation of all interested, and they shall have entire control of the funds collected, which shall be depos­ ited in some bank at their order, and which funds, unless used to con­ test the claim aforesaid, shall be re­ turned to the donors, except the suais necessary fir our actual expenses. Timely Notice Served. There is a growing sentiment among Republicans that a due regard for his own reputation and the interests of the party will soon compel Mr. Washburn to take some notice of these dastardly attacks and give their author an op­ portunity to provo his charges in a court of justice. And we serve timely notice on all concerned, that theRepublicans of this district will not much longer submit to the false and slanderous imputations which tbe Globe is daily heaping upon them and their successful candidate.—St. Paul Dispatch. This threat of the Washburn crowd to force the Globe into an expensive libel suit does not frighten the pub* lisher of that paper in the least. The Giobe replied as follows: "Bill Washburn would evidently like to muzzle the
