Hates' proposition to create the office of Captain General of tbe army or the benefit of Grant, don't seern to be generally relished. People are beginning to think that tbe great American tramp has been pretty felly compensated for all bis services. Joseph Larkin, of MeadrHIe. Pa., Collector of City and County Taxs, hot himself on Sunday last, the buM let entering' near tbe center of the forehead, and taking an upward ten dency. The physicians pronounce the weand mortal. Financial trouble is aid to be the caure. Two-thikds of the city of Peneaco la, Fla, was destroyed by fire Satur day night. About one hundred and fifty buildings were burned, including the United States Custom House and Postofflce, tbe Merchant's Hotel, and eyeral other fine buildings. The 1o6 Is estimated at $500,000, ou which there is $249,000 insurance. Ahjp . now Hayes comes out in a Proclamation announcing free trade with China. It is reported that the treaty was actually made in time lobe proclaimed before tbe late election, and that Hayes knew it before he left California, but that it was kept back for tbe reason that it might hurl Gar field. Jobs' Kelly, tbe Tammany boss, has been bounced Irom the office ol Comptroller, and Allen Campbell cho en aa his successor, and the nomina tion made by Mayor Ceoper confirm ed. This was brought about by an alliance ot the anti-Tammauy Alder jnen wHh Republicans. Great excite tnent prevailed throughout the city over tbe overthrow of the " Bote." . Tbb aaonal report of the Ohio State Inspector of Mines shows that for the year ending May 31t,15S0, the aggns gate output of coil from Ohio mije? was 6,307,725 tone, aud the Co mm is aioner estimates that tbe aggregate oatput for the year ending December 31st, 1880, will reach, if it does not exceed, 7,000,000 ten 4. The balance of trade for the year endipg October 31, 187'J, was $2G!), 200.000 fa our favor, but for the year nding October 31, 1830, it had been reduced to $155,500,000, a falling off f $113,700,000. This shows a re markable change going on in tbe for eign 'commerce of tbe country. As times Improve, the importation of foreign luxuries largely increases. The Republicans are doing every thing In their power to prevent the adoption of the joint rule for counting the electoral vote by Congress. Gen. Grant was twice counted in under a similar rale, but the Rads don't relish their own legislation, because they are determined to defeat every meas ure which does not recognize tbe ar bitrary authority of the Vice-President to make the count. JLm Age of Improvement. We live in an age of improvements aa Is evident to all when we consider tbe wonderful discoveries which are coming to light day by day. One of tbe latest and most wonderful is the discovery of Kendall's Spavin Cure, which will cure a spavin, splint, curb, callous or ring-bone, and remove the enlargement without even blistering or causing a sore and it has recently been tested for deep-seated pains, rheumatism, enlargements and many similar difficulties on man as well as beast, and it has been found to work uo well that it la believed to be the very beet liniment for external use on mau that has ever been discovered. It can be used full strength at all seasonsof tbe year with peaect safety. Read the advertisement for Kendall's Spavin Cure. The Republican leaders, while gloat ing over their great victory and declar ing- that the Democratic party is dead, seem to forget that they have been ut tering that silly twaddle for the past twenty years, and yet at every return ing election the party of Jefferson and Jackson comes to the front ready as ever to fight for the principles of equal privileges against the monopolists. They seem to be ignorant of the fact that at the late election General Han cock received the votes of nineteen States, and that Garfield received not a greater number, while he is largely in Ihe minority of the . popular vote, and that, with the aid of the solid ne gro vote of the North, the 100,000 fed eral office holders, the National Hanks, the eoereion of employes by mammoth manufacturing establishments through out the country and all the corrupt ap pliances of colonization of voters, false registration and tyrannical employ ment, of the federal electiou machinery they were able to eke out only 3,401 plurality of the popular vote for the great bribe-taker. Their victory was dearly bought, indeed, and a becom ing modesty should dictate to the lead ers that they go slow in boasting over their triumph. And above all things they should not fail to remember that the Democratic party is not dead nor does it propose to ground the weapons of its warfare while the country is confronted with the momentous ques tion of revolutionizing the govern ment of the fathers and planting upon the ruins of the republic they estab lished a "strong government," inJ which the reserved powers of the States shall be ignored, State lines ob literated and the national government assume imperial authority, or while the attempt is made to build up a privileged order in this land. The Democratic party is the party of the Constitution and equal rights, and whenever the atu-mpt is madetoover throw'the government which it estab lishes, every man faithful to its prin ciples and worthy to bear its great name will be found in the front rauks ready to renew the fight against the monarchial doctrines of the Radical party and in favor of the constitution and human rights. The time was, when the United States was regarded as a confederation of States, before it had -grown, under the nursing of the Republicans, to be a nation with a big N, that its flag was respected In every quarter of the civ ilized world, and &irorwa mU pro-1 tection to every American citizen, but since it has grown to be a " strong government" it pockets the insult to its flag by a Chilian cruiser, without any apparent attempt to resent or re dress it. A little less brag and bluster and a trifle more exhibition of back bone would be more becoming. Hon.-E. B. Taylor, who was chosen ou the 30th ult., to serve out the un expired term of Gen. Garfield in the House, is not permitted to take undis puted possession of the seat. Hon. Frank llurd insists that Taylor's cre dentials be referred to the Committee on Elections, averring that Taylor does not represent any district, either under the laws of the United States or the laws of Ohio. Rut Taylor has been sworn in. The Madisou County Court House, at Anderson, Indiana, with its con tents, was destroyed by fire ou Friday morning last. Should not the occa sional destruction of public Guiltliugs aud records admonish our public serv ants of the necessity of guarding against a like calamity? If such a disaster should befall us somebody will be held guilty of culpable negligence. Hayes' message Hoi led Down. We published Hayes' last annual message in full last week, and presume it has been pretty generally read and its suggestions weighed, but for the benefit of those who have not thought it worth while to wade through the long, prosy document, we present the following brief summary thereof: The message recommends land grants, and if necessary, the appropri ation of money for educational pur poses in the South ; an appropriation lor a commission to devise a system of competitive examinations applicable to all branches of the civil service; proposes reform in the method of ap pointment and removal of higher of ficers; calls attention K the Mormon question and suggests a change of Government Tor Utah, aud touches upon the position of the Government iu the Fortune Bay affair, Iu a re view of our foreign relation, Mr. Hayes reiterates his views of the De Leeps canal project aa expressed iu a special message to Congress iu March last, and albo mentions the safe arrival of the .Egyptian obelisk. President Hayes coucurs with iSecretary Sher man in recommending the substitution of an honest xOO-ceul sWver dollar, for the present standard dollar, which the Treasury has been unable to force into ciiculation. The surplus revenue for the next year is estimated at over $00,000,000, aud Mr. Sherman presents to Congress the alternative of either reduciug taxation or devoting the sur plus to the further reduction of tbe debt. Mr. Hayes also suggests that Congress should create the rank of Captain-General of tbe Army for Gen Grant. alter a Pardon. The Warren correspondent of the Pittsburgh Post says: Some of the friends of George R. Kennedy, the de faulting auditor of Trumbull county, held a meeting to consult and take ac tion in procuring his pardon from the penitentiary, where he is serving out a term of three years. It was decid ed to circulate a petition for signatures, and confidence was expressed that if proper representations were made to Governor Foster, backed by a numer ously signed petition, that there was nodoubtof success. The ou ly au x iety seemed to be as to how Mr. Peterson of the Tribune, regarded it whether he would give his approval or remain si lent. He might create an unpleasant ness by stirring up the rural kickers. AH the expressions of sympathy were on behalf of Kennedy's wife. There is a good deal of maudlin sentiment exhibited over this Republican olficial who has stolen more than all the horse ( thieves and burglars taken together , ever sentenced from this county, When, after several efforts a couvic-, tion that would stick was procured by a compromise, the sentence was almost unanimously regarded as trifling com- pared with the offense, taking tbe in-, telligence and standing of the culprit into account. The only palliating fact in the case is, that he was not much worse than other officials that were associated with him, and who were al lowed to return their ill-gotten plun der to the treasury and go ecot free." Washington Letter. Washington, Dec. 3rd, 1880. Congress is again in full blast and is proving itself as much a windmill as any of its predecessors. On Monday both houses convened with the qui etude aud informality which charac terize the opening hours of the last Bession of Congress. The receiving and reading of the President's Message is usually the main duty of the day, and yet, in this instance, the groundwork was laid for a winter's debate by the introduction of the electoral count measure before thecouu try knew what Hayes had to say upon the iolitical matters of the Government. Now the House is busied wrestling with that exceedingly indefinite aud vexations problem involved in the couuting of the electoral vote, and dear only knows whether any Other question will be considered until the windmill exhausts itself. Mr. Garfield is elected all ad mit that but the manner of declaring the fact is the weighty couumlrum be fore the average Congressmau, and every other political interest of the country wil have to sutler pending the solution. It is astonishing how many bills similar to this in real uselessuess have been resurrected by members ambitious of notoriety at home, with certain classes of constituents, or with the press. And yet all know that un less tbe present program in debate is dropped the last session of the 46th Congress will be as barren of useful legislation as that of the 44th, when Mr. Hayes' admission to the White House had to be determined. The Senate, however, is pegging away quietly at sundry matters, and dispos ing of them with its usual dispatch, when its windmill is not aroused into activity by some purely political breeze Senator Voorhees is vigorously push iug his bill for the erectiou of a Nation al Library. He, and his Committee, have unanimously decided against fur ther occupancy of the Capitol for Li brary puritoses, either by extension of the building or by the use of the pres ent rooms, which are so wholly inade quate for the daily needs, and will rec ommend the erection of au ample structure upon some one' of the Gov ernment reservations, probably Judi ciary Square.which is oueof our largest parks. Two most important matters have appeared iu the Senate. One looking to the purchase from the legal representatives of the ex-Confederate Generals Bragg and Polk, their private naiiers relating to the late war ; the other, the annotiucemenTror MrrRan dolph that he will, on Monday next, ask the Senate to consider the bill re storing Fitz John Porter to the army without pay. Both these measures will provoke extended debate. The proposed purchase does an apparent wrong to the ex-Confederates who have freely given their private papers ; the country knows the objections which are urged against the restora tion of a cashiered officer. It is our belief, however, that some form of re lief will be given him as a sequence of his persisteut fight. He was evidently in the wVong at the time he is alleged to have disobeyed Pope's orders, but as it is admitted that other generals shared his unwillingness to fight under Pope, aud quite as openly and directly were guilty of disobediance, the feeling is undoubtedly growing here that Por ter should have fair play, or rather, should not be made the scapegoat for all the alM)ini nations of the fall-campaign of 1SC2. It is settled that we are to have au Agricultural Report for 1879, Senator Johnson has ascertained that the delay in publicatiog has been caused by the difficulties experienced in getting the illustrations for it. The Public Printer informs the Senator that the Uejiort will be ready for dis tribution a'.out Christmas. It is very voluminous, much more so than any of its predecessors, and, in so far as we have examined it, we regard it as con taining much more of real value to farmers generally than any of the series for many years past. It is so cus tomary to deride the Agricultural Re port, that the public have come to re gard it as one of tbe means used by Congress to waste our revenue, but the truth is, that no other official report contains more valuable information for any one class than this of the Ag ricultural Department. It covers the investigations of experts and scientists into the causes leading to the losses of farmers in all directions, and ridicule it as we may, the country reaps an im mense benefit from this published work of the Commissioners' of Agri culture. It should have au immense distribution. ' The feeling is undoubted in Con gress that the present taxes ou matches and bank checks must Unabolished. The pressure against the taxes, partic ularly on matches, was very stroiis; last winter, aud now seems to have assumed shape iu the guaranty of re moval. 8 few people are troubled with bank accounts that the two cents required upon a check does not draw forth a universal protest like the penny on matches. meeting- r tbe Portage County itledical Society. Ravenna, Dec. 2, 1S80. Society convened in Dr. Alcorn's office und was called to order by the President, Dr. Hugus. Secretary Dr. Moralh being absent, Dr. Alcorn was appointed Secretary pro tern. The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved. Dr. Leonard presented two cases for opinion aud treatment; one a case of chronic diarrhoea of four years stand ing, rendering the patient totally una ble to labor, the other a fine specimen of herpes circinatus. Treatment sug gested for each case. A very interesting paper was then read by Dr. Leonard on the subject of Diphtheria, giviug its pathology .treat ment and valuable suggestions for the prevention, or for mollifying the poi sonous substances which propagate the disease. The Dr. would have a Com mittee appointed whose duty would be to report on the origin and nature of the poison, and how best to shield our homes from its invasion, and that this Committee should reach the people through the public press of the county. The Dr. thought such report from our own home talent would be much more likely to attract the attention of our citizens than that from distant author- ity. The subject of the essay w as free- ly discussed by different members, but especially by Dr. E. W. Price, of Kent, where the disease has done its most deadly work. The Dr. spoke of the different grades of of the disease, of its attack upon every class of society and iu every kind of locality the families upon the high sand banks as well as those along the flats. When the afternoon was spent in earnest discussion, the meeting ad. journed to meet in Pr. Waggoner's of fice on the first Thursday of January, 1881. H- P. H pg us, Pres'.t. A. W. Alcorn, Sec. pro tern. That Hunting Party. Friend Harris: Perhaps your readers would be pleased to kuow something of the Portage County par ty which recently were deer hunting in the mountains of Pennsylvania. I will tbeiefore furnish you a brief statement of the facts. On the 4th of November, at 8,20 A. AT, we started for Coiry yia. N. Y., Pa. & O. R. R-, where we arrived at 1 P. M. There took the P. & E. R. 11. for Sheffield. .Arrived at Sheffield at 4 P. M., where most of our parly put up for the night at the Lse House, kept by mino host Louis Lay, where we bad tbe best of fare for the night. air Lrotucr?, with one or two more of our party, went to Lower Sheffield and staid over night with E. Carey, Esq., who was to be our guide, aud who expected fo hunt with us. Mormug ot the otn, Alex, vail re turned to Sheffield and told us that the drive to (ho hunting ground would piobably bo bad. He brought with km Alex. Marshall, with a very heavy spun of horses to take us up the mountain to Ihohuntiug grouud, said to be twenty one miles distaut. We loaded and bound ou our baggage, weighing 1464 pounds, aud at 9 A. M started. O, Allyn. S. S. Iiurlbut, aud myself, were to ride. I walked to Beeu's P. O., two and one-half miles, then got on to the wagou and rode a mile, aud such a ride! Sometimes one wheel up two feet on a rock, then it suddenly dropped luto a chuck-hole'. It required active work and strong bauds to keep top of the load, so I concluded to foot it up the mountain. Our team had to go by the way ol Hrookstowti, and our party could save lour miles by taking up tbe mountain across to the Waison place (so known) where we arrived at 2,30 P. M. Here we had to wait uulil 4 P. M, for our team. We saw many deer tracks here in the road. One of our party Wil bird M-thau took his rifle and struck out iuto the woods a short distance, aud returned, saying he had secu a flock of deer going down the hillside. He guessed there were five of them, but it looked as though there were five hundred. We all had a hearty laugh, and Alex. Vair went out and saw their track?, and said there were five of them. Four P. M. our team came, and we had some eight miles yet to make to reach our buutiug ground We'held consultation, aud decided te encamp here for the night. Went iuto au old hunters' camp which was about ten feet square, got our supper, and spent tbe eveuing cutting hemlock boughs and preparing bunks on which to sleep. Iu this little room eleven of us slept or staid that night. Five A. M., Nov. C, breakfasted and started on our jourucy. 1 P. M., we had made five miles and stopped near the Cunningham place (90 kuown), and the teamster said be could not pull our load the balance of the way to Mill Brook. So we here held coun sel, and decided to atop at an old hun ters' camp, one-half mile west of uf, which had becu burned out a year or so before. This place we reached with our team about 2 P. M., and unloaded our baggage, paid our teamster $10, and he left. It commenced to rain, and the winds" rose, and the storm became frightful. We had uo shelter except some old deserted Indian wig wam?, unused for the last two years. Well, we weut to work, cut logo, aud put up a large loghcap, and here, amid a howling storm snapping and crash ing the mighty hemlocks at our right and at our left, to tho ground, we spent the night, Sunday morning, the 7ih, the wind had shifted to the north, aud it com menced freezing. We went at once to repairing our camp so as to have our house iu order lor the fol'owing night. Ou Monday we finished our camp, aud Tuesday we divided our party and struck out in various directions, prospecting aud running lines, and raarkiug trees to camp. These lines were north, east aud west. The trees we marked three notches toward camp, oue notch from camp. This work took several drys. Fred. French, who was down the Blue Jay about three mile, killed a fine large buck, weighing about 175 pounds. This was the first deer and the first pair of horns got by our par ty. Ou the following day, Orsou Collins aud Hiram II u! sou were out diluting in company. John Collins shot st a large doe about forty rods dig'"!, running at full speed, and killed her. This was the second vcu isou lor the party. After this tho ground became dry and frozeu, aud the twigs cracked aud leaves ratttea so that we nan poor luck for several days. Fiually there came a little snow, and oue day ot good hunting; we hung up three deer on that day. Then it turned cold, mercury 10 deg. below zero, and poor hunting; too noisy ; but James Vair, O. Callius and myself, hunting in company, to share equally, killed a young buck, I following the track, James Vair flanking on my right and Collins ou my left. We followed this deer from about 10 A. M. uutil about 12 M., when the deer came out to Vair, who shot it, wounding it severe ly. We then followed it until about 3 P. M., shooting at it any chauce, when Vair got In another shot that killed the deer. James Vair had also killed a deer the same morning, before we saw this one. Hiram Hutson afso killed a deer on tbe same day. This was ouo good day. S. S, Iiurlbut af terward killed a fine young buck, and Fred. French killed another large buck, the largest by auy of us killed or seen while we were in the moun tains. It was from this deer that tbe large and curious horns were by us obtained. Freuch also killed another Hue buck, and he well earned the name given him before he started "Kill Buck." By the way, the party were all named before leaving for tbe pleas aut hunting ground. We eat the fore quarters iu camp. making us an abuudancc of meat dur ing our stay. One of my legs became badly galled by weariug heavy boots, aud I caught cold iu the wound aud was complete' ly disabled for about two weeks. Williard Mahan left for home after being with us about ten days, and Q, Allyn left in about two weeks, the rest of our party remained four weeks lacking two days. We had a pleasant time. There were plenty of deer.some bears and wild cats, and other game in the woods, but the weather was so cold and traveling co noisy wo concluded best to break camp and leave. ' Our hunting ground was about two thousaud feet aboye tide water, and leaving camp and getting to Sheffield was about as d.:fuV.ult at it was getting into camp. S. D. N. DeLkssei's canal scheme is boom ing. On the day the books were op ened nearly $4,000,000 of stock were taken in New York, and $1,000,000 has been subscribed in San Francisco. Since the election of Garfield, near ly every day brings tho news of the failure of one or more business houses. That of B. G. Arnold & Sons, coffee dealers of New York, is the heaviest yet reported. When it was generally believed that Hancock would be elect ed these thiiiKS did not occur. What can the matter be ? Is the couutry ou the eve of another commercial and financial crash ? THE
