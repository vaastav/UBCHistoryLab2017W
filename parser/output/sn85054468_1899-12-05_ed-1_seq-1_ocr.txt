BOERS' STRONG DEFENCES. An Idenl Position on the Xortli Bnnlc of Miidder Itiver. MODDER RIVER, via Orange River, Nov. 29. An inspection of the Boer posi tion reveals the fact that the enemy's de fences were of extraordinary strength. The British were compelled to make their at tack from a wide plateau, scorched by the sun, while the Boers had the advantage of natural cover and the low, uncemented walls around the gardens of the two hotels which the town of Modder River boasts. The difficulties of the British were increas. b th,e fact th?t the Boers had dug trenches for more than half a mile on each j side of the southernmost gardens. The j military officers have expressed admiration , of the skill displayed by the Boers. The latter had marked their artillery ranges ! with cans and wooden crosses, which en abled them to use their guns to the best ! advantage. The Argyll Regiment suffered severely while making a bayonet charge ! and while waiting at the drift or ford across the river for support.

MANIL.A, Dec. 412:50 p. in. A courier who left Genqral Young at CanCon on No vember 23 reached a place from which he could telegraph last nighL General Young reports that he captured a letter dated November 2S, which said that Agulnaldo was then at Cervantes, heading for Bokoc, and that General Tinio, with 600 insur gents, was entrenched between Vigan and Bangued. Cervantes is ahut thirty miles Inland from Bokoc, or Bogog, a seaport about thirty miles north of Vigan. General Young thinks that Aguinaldo is trying to take his American and Span ish prisoners into the Cngayan Val.ey, but the insurgents may try to seek the north ern coast of Liano. General Young, with a troop of the Third Cavalry and a bat talion of the Thirty-third Infantry, is going into the mountains to cut off General Tinio's retreat. General Wilder, with his Maeabebes, is pushing on to Cervantes, and Major Swi gert, with two troops of cavalry, is patrol" ing the coast between San Estcban and Vigan. The Maeabebes have established a line from Namagpaean east to the moun tains to prevent the insurgent retreat. Aguinaldo's escape now fcems impossible. General Young's advance has been a con tinuous ovation, and his reception by the natives has been like that accorded Ameri can troops in Porto Rico. Bands have turned out to welcome him and the crowds have cheered him and his troops. Tho insurgents, when leaving Tagudin, burned the bridge. When the Americans arrived the Inhabitants of the town had rafts ready for their use. The country is rich, and the troops are well supplied with pro visions. TOWN OF O'DONNELIi OCCUPIED.

CAPTURE OF MARACAXBO. Additional TletnilM of the Insurgent A'ietorj in Venezuela. NEW YORK, Dec. 4. A cable report from Carcaras, telling of a severe defeat of the Government troops at Maracaibo nnd the capture of the place by insurgents, came as a complete surprise to Venezuelans here, even sympathizers with the revolu tion. Neither official nor rebel advices have indicated the presence of revolutionists at Maracaibo, and the explanation is that emis saries of the rebel leader. General Hernan dez, succeeded in inciting the Government soldiers in the barracks and the inhabitants of Maracaibo to rise. In President An-, drade's administration General Hernandez was a political prisoner in the fort at Mara caibo, and he made many friends there. The taking of Maracaibo is the first im portant conflict of the insurrection and is a serious affair for the Government, as the port is the principal one of northern Ven ezuela. Exports of coffee from Colombia are made via Maracaibo, and, including the homo product, about 40,000 bags are shipped monthly from that port. The export duty accruing from this is large and will uow fall into the hands of the insurgents un less the Government blockades the port. Senor Antonio E. Delilno, Consul Gen eral in this city, had no official despatch today to the effect that the port had been closed. Senor N. Bolct-Peraza, special representative of the provisional govern ment in this country, made the following statement today: "The situation In Ven ezuela is a very grave one. We will pe haps hear of an occasional insurgent vic tory, but 1 am sanguine of the outcome, and that the Government will win. I do believe that the revolution will be a long one and will be desperately contested, it might continue for six months', but us we have greater resources to draw from than have the Insurgents we shall eventually triumph. Valencia will be the scene or the principal engagement, and if the rebels lose there the rebellion will end." "But suppose the Government should be defeated at Valencia?" "Then," said the Government represen tative, "the war will go on." T1V? main body of Insurgents, with Gen eral Hernandez in command; is said to bo on the outskirts of Valencia, and news of a battle is expected In a few days. Flyiin's BuhlncNfi College, Sth and Iv.

3I0LIXELX TRIAL SOW ON. The Css.se Ontlined to the Jury ! the District Attorney NEW YORK, Dec. 1. Newspaper corre spondents from the principal cities, nov elists, magazine writers, and professional men sat for five hours in the Court of Gen eral Sessions today listening to the case of the people against Ro!and B, Moiineux, indicted for sending through the mails to Harry Cornish tho poison that caused tho death of Mrs. Katherine J. Adams. Moi ineux was led into the courtroom a few minutes after Recorder Goff went upon the bench. His father, General Moiineux, sat beside him. Bartow S. Weeks and George Gordon Battle, counsel for the defendant, shook hands with the pale-faced young man., and whispered with him. Assistant District Attorney Osborne and the two as sistants of the district attorney's office who are helping him sat Itwide the rail. Four of the 104 witnesses who will be called for the prosecution were in court, j They are the three policemen and the cor oner's physician who, on the night of the 28th of December, had been hurriedly sum moned to the home of Mrs. Adams to learn that the crime of murder had been com mitted. They were not called upon to tes tify, however, for Assistant District At torney Osborne was exhausted at the close of his address to the jury and asked the court to adjourn until 10:30 tomorrow morning. Mr. Osborne began describing the poison ing of Mrs. Adams, who lived with her grown up daughter, Mrs. Fiorgncs Roge.s, in a West Side apartment hoiue. Harry S. Cornish, a relative by marriage, boarded with them. He had known them from his boyhood. Nobody, he said, had any de sire to kill Mrs. Adams. It was by acci dent tho poison meant for Cornish was given to her. "We have before us," said Mr. Osborne, "the package received by Cornihh, with the Tiffany envelope, the wrapping paper, and the silver hot le holder preserved. Next In broad day we have nlm administering the fatal poison to Mrs. Adams, and at the same time taking a dose himself. Nevertheless, I wjll say, on be half of the State and the detective office, that never has anybody been Investigated as this same Harry Cornish. Fi.st satisfy yourselves that the man who. gave the dose was not tho guilty man." Mr. Osborne then went on to declare that to And the prisoner a man must, be sought who spent his time between New York nnd Newark, where the silver holder was bought, and who was also acquainted with the character of cyanide of. mercury. Mr. Osborne said he would bring before the jury a man who had a motive for hating' Cornish continually and for a long time. The jury would also be satisfied that he lived partly in Newark and that he had a long, smoldering hatred for- Cornish; that he was a colormaker, and could have had the poison in his possession-; that he knew where Hartigan's store was and could have purchased the silver bottle holder there. If the jury was satisfied of all this and refused to convict, society would be liable to other such crimes. Still, there was other proof. "As I said before," continued the prose cuting attorney, "there are only three cases 1 or poisoning by cyanide of mercury on recoid, and the doctor who had been called to attend Cornish had attended one other case. That was the case of a young man who died under suspicious circumstances, at the Knickerbocker Athleti Club H. C. Barnct." Here Mr. Weeks objected to the intro duction ot Barnct's name. He objected to anv reference to the death of Barnet. . After a long light Mr. Weeks' objection was overruled.. Mr. Osborne- thereupon went on to point out tho significant re semblances between Barnet's death and that of Mrs. Adams, and then took up the clew of the three-crescent notepaper, which he said was purchased in- Newark. Following this Mr. Osborne came to the letters to the patent medicine '.inns. While on this point he said: "That the handwriting experts who had seen the inscription on the poison package were unanimous in saying that it had been written by the person who had hired the letter boxes. The person who had hired the letter boxes at one agency under the name of Cornish was the same who had hired the letter box at another agency under the name of Barnet. The person who had hired these letter boxes had sent to tho patent medicine concerns for a cer tain remedy and, in writing, gave a de scription of himself. His age, height, weight, chest, and waist measures cor responded in both cases with each other and with the defendant's. Mr. Osborne then continued and told the jury, even it all of-the handwriting experts paid no, the jury would be convinced by its own eyes that the same person wrQte all the letter-box letters and addressed the iwlson package. The prisoner was a man who hated Cornish, who hatsd Barnet, who hated Ilarpster. The piosecuiing attorney then went over the points he had made, declaring that the prisoner was the only person who tallied in every point with the man whoae actions nnd characteristics he had been describing, and, in conclusion, he said: "There Is only one human being on this whole earth who answers every description of the prisoner, and that man Is this de fendant at the lyir. Roland B; Moiineux." "I'm delighted," whispered Moiineux to his counsel as Osborne conoluded and sot dow n. The first witness to be called tomorrow will be Dr. Edwin F. Hitchcock, who was called to attend Mrs. A dame Imme diately ufter she swallowed the poison that had been mixed with the bronio-seltzer. He will be followed by Policeman- Palmer, who took possession of the polsigi" dregs in the glass in Mrs. Adams' loom, and who handed the same to Coroner's Physician Weston. Dr. Weston will probably be the third wit ness. SIX DAYS' CYCLE BACE. The 'renin Seore at 1 o'clock This Morning'. NEW YORK, Dec. 1.

Roberts, the Mormon Rep resentative from Utah, will not be per mitted to occupy the seat to which he was elected by the citizens of his State, in the House of Representatives. By a practically unanimous vote, the House yesterday refused to permit him to take the oath of office and directed him to step aside and await the decision of a special committee to be appointed to try his case. By its action the House has, in effect, transformed Mr. Roberts from a Representative-elect to that of a mere claimant lo a seat, and a very doubtful claimant at that. The Roberts case is likely to become historical. No one is contesting his seat, as his election was not disputed. Ho is lo be deprived of his seat on the ground that ho 's Ineligible, owing to the fact that he is a polygamist and a violator of the laws of the United States. It is believed that the opponents of Roberts will be able to sustain their con tention and make out a legal case against him. It is undoubtedly a fact that the prompt and perhaps somewhat arbitrary action of the House yesterday was the direct response of the almost universal sentiment of the people of the country. The People AjuliiHt PolyKHiny. Public sentiment condemned Roberts and what he stood for long in advance of the assembling of the Fifty-sixth Congress. It is only fair to Mr. Roberts to say that the sentiment of the people was not directed so much against him personally as the odius institution which he is sup posed to represent. The dominating and all pervading idea that has apparently actuated the public mind has been to put a final quietus on polygamy and strike It such a blow that it will never be able to raise its head again in the United States. It is not Jikoly that Utah will ever again undertako to send a polyga mist to represent. her. in the National Leg islature. There was more interest manifested in Roberts and his case yesterday by the thousands of people who swarmed In and around the Capitol building than in the incidents and scenes connected with the opening of the new Congress. He was, to use a favorite expression, "the cynosure of all eyes." Every one was anxious to get a -glimpse of the man who had indi rectly raised all- the rumpus. It was apparent to even the most casus. I observer that there was something more than Idle curiosity agitating the immense throng. There was an undercurrent of deep and strong feeling which even extend ed to the members on tho floor of the House. Several days ago the opinion was ex pressed by several prominent Repiesenta tivesthat Mr. Roberts would be permitted to take his seat; that it would be a dan gerous precedent to establish to refuse admittance to a Representative who pre sented himself with duly acoredited cre dential but yesterday there was not one bold enough to speak up in Roberts' fa vor. Mr. Roberts arrived at the Cap'tol early. He took a seat well back on the Demo cratic side, and to the right of the centre. He is a dark, swarthy man, above the medium height, apparently not much over forty years of age. He has firm jaws-, a high, broad forehead, and a ma3s of Jet black hair; a heavy mustache of the sme color punctuates his strong features. He was dressed yesterday in the conent onal suit of Congressional black, that is, a frock coat, high collar, and black tie. He seemed to be calm and collected, and if he was aware of his impending fate he gave no evidence of It. The crowd waited patiently through t'je tedious roll call- and the preliminary work of swearing in the new Speaker and per fecting the organization of the House. When finally, however, Utah was ca led, a hush of expectancy and suppressed ex citement passed over the hall. Would there be a scene? was the question each one was asking his neighbor. Roberts at the liar. Mr. Roberts arose and started down the aisle to the bar of the House to re ceive the oath of office. His name wxs the first on the list or the group, and as the Speaker pronounced it, Mr. Tayler of Ohio took the floor and raised an ob jection. "I object to Mr. Roberts taking the oath," said Mr. Tayler, in a -somewhat dramatic manner, "on the ground that he Is a polygamist, and that it is alleged that he is not a citizen." At this point a buzz of surprise was created by Judge McRea of Arkansas (Dem ocrat) arising and seconding the motion of Mr. Tayler. It was made apparent that both parties had decided on n common line of action. After Judge McRea sat down the Speaker requested Mr. Roberts to step aside. Mr. Roberts replied that in stepping aside he did so with the understanding that he waived none or his rights. Speaker Henderson told him that his rights would be protected, and Mr. Roberts resumed his feat, after which Mr. Taylei offered the following resolution, which will bo -adopted today, after the reading of President McKInley's message, aad prob ably without a single dissenting vote.

Miller, the fugitive manager of Che great money-making ail swindling scheme known as the 'Franklin Syndicate.' of Brooklyn, was placed under arrest thl3 morning in Montreal by Superintendent William Sutherland, of a private detective agency, the information regarding the cap ture being first received at the main office of tho agency here through a brief tele gram from Sutherland, which said: 'Sub ject captured.' "A short time before the superintendent had wired "Subject located, which meant beyond doubt that Miller was in Montreal and would probably be in the bands of the detectives before long. "Sutherland also wired, after the arrest, that the identification of Miller was com plete, as the prisoner bad been confronted with several persons who knew bini well. He is now In Jail." E3T0CKS OTJT A TUtTST. The Supreme Court Itcmler u Most Imnorttint UeelHion. The Supreme Court, in its decision of the Addyston pipe case yesterday, delivered a knockout blow to one trust and the actios may affect all trade combinations which have been recently made. The ease involv ed the constitutionality of the combination of pipe manufacturers, which, it was charged, was a trust. The decision, which was handed down by Justice Peck ham. was adverse to the combination. The opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth cir cuit was affirmed. The suit was brought by the Government against the Addyston Pipe and Steel Com pany, under the provisions of the Sherman Anti-Trust law. The company Is a combi nation composed of the Addyston Pipe and Steel Company, Dennis Long Co., the Annis(oa Pipe and Foundry Company, the South PJiisburg Pipe Works, and the Chat tanoogajl?oindry and Pipe Works, concerns located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Ohio, and engaged in manufacturing a large proportion of the cast iron pipe made in the country. The Government alleged that the combination dominated the market and virtually regulated the price and out put, and is, therefore, a violation of the Anti-Trust law. The suit asked that all pipe sold and transported from one State to another by the company be confiscated to the United States, and that the company be perpet ually enjoined from operating, inasmuch as it is engaged, tbe Government alleges. in an "unlawful conspiracy." This organization is in form similar to. the hundreds of other Industrial eombiaa- tlons. so many of which have been formed during the last two years, and the decia- ion in the case is therefore applicable to trusts in general. The case was first tried in 1W in the Circuit Court of the Eastern district of xennessee. anu was nsiue j , court.
