Ill, which I have ar i.ii.ped for the Primary Class In Jour i.aiism. It deals with what we ma rail the Elementary Ethics of Journal ::n. It had been my intention to in-, i luiie the truths I am now about to yet forth in a lesson designed for the Advanced Journalistic Course, but I notice that some of you. especially the livening Outcast, are already com mitting the fault, in your ignorance, it is true, of violating recognized prac tices 'n this noble profession. I cannot therefore begin too early to correct such errors as I may observe. Later in the course I shall deal with this subject ::iore fully. unlawful ftltprnvisp tvhtnh thu tPnlterl States postal regulations do not per mit. At any rate, go-called subscrip tion contests are not new. Their ori gin is lost in the mists of antiquity. Newspapers have always taken part In them and always will do so. I am told, too, that the Evening Out cast is making a foolish claim to being the original comic supplement, which would not be a thing to be proud of if it were true. But it is not true. There were supplements even more comical and ridiculous than the Evening Out cart many years before the Evening Outcast was Inaugu-ated. Many news papers eminent and respectable have become victims of the comic supple ment craze. The more eminent and respectable they were the longer were they able to rsist the encroachments of that form of insanity. I have in mind the case of the Los Angeles Times, one of the ablest newspapers In the west, which was the last to fall, .while the Covina Register was among the frst. I trust that with the aid of thee lessons, and experience the Evening Outcast will ultimately prevail over the disagreeable trait of fpolish boast ing.

The iirst is the adoption of a long-since ex- net system of securing patronage. It was abandoned because it was found by experience to be based upon the false principle of 'Substitution." which i.-- now universally recognized as rep rehensible. as I shall now illustrat?. The Republican advertisement to which the Evening Outcast aspired and a copy of hlch it pasted on a postcard and mailed to the address given there in was as follows: '" R SALE A t:io of Thorough bred Pekin Ducks.

The charm of Lew Wallace's Auto biography consists not only in the act that the author was a famous general and famous novelist, but that so man) of his recollections are reminiscent of the great. One of the most fascinating descrip tions is that of his first sight of Abra ham Lincoln. It was In 1S50, at a tavern in Danville, 111. The big room of the tavern was crowded with men. laughing and cheering as story after siory was told by three of the best tiory tellers of Indiana and two Illinois men whom Wallace did not know. It was a storv comiietition between the lete and obje. tjonable practice. The ! men of the rival states, next error was in misapprehending the Wallace writes as follows: intention of the advertiser, who plainly ..Xne Criss-c:ossing went on till mid wanted to sell three Fekin ducks. His j niht and for a long time it might not purpose, as we may easily inter, was De sai.l whether Illinois-or Indiana was There are a great many things be side mountain scenery that make Pres cott a nice place to visit. The town Is attractive In many ways, and not th still life merely but the people, have great deal to do with It. A town with out good people In it is not much of a town, and Prescott Is a good town. Good people know how to live and not a few of theru in Prescott have banded together to make the institution known as the Yavapai clu'i the inner circle of good living in northern Arizona. The wayfaring man who is bidden to enter the portals of that hospitable re sort has never been known to refuse when he was in his right mind, and after the first invitation he la crazy to get back "again. If he wasn't crazy on this point there might be good reasons for believing him insane. Xo sane man when self possessed, could recline In an easy chair with the world's best liter ature at his elbow while toasting his shins at the open fireplace of the Yava pai club, any time between Xovember and Ground Hog day, without feeling that the winter season has some virtues the spring poets have entirely over looked. Xor can the most fastidious epicure put his feet under a table In the club dining room without being Im pressed that In Prescott Thanksgiving Is a perpetual feast day. When he wearies of plainsoup, spuds and beef steak, he may regale himself with "Potage Aux Riz Tomate." "Pomme De Terre En Puree." or fall to with zest after a helping of "nouilli De Gigot De Mouton," which literally Interpreted, means that whatever else It is, it Is Bully Good Mutton. That Is not all there is to eat at the club, by any means, but it Is enough to show that the Prescott people know a good thing when they see It and they have a better opportunity to see things than most people, for the club management Is alive to Its mission on earth and does not perform Its duties In a merely per functory manner. Charles Desmond, on whom devolves the duties of manager, has fitted him self Into his particular niche In thi local temple of fame, as snugly as though he were made for the place. It happens to be a good bi;r place, and he happens to be Just big enough to fill It without spreading out nny. And as for the chef, he can cook in Just as many languages as his guests can eat In. and when the delicious viands are served it ruts the guests to ruminating over that old question of whether man eats to live or lives to eat. One thing certain, the eating at the Yavapai club Is worth living for. The pleasing feature of all this is that i the Yavapai club Is not an exclusively exclusive Institution. It is the ideal of i good fellowship, good citizenship and good living. One has to pass reason able requirements In these qualities, but the caste is not so exalted that no body can gain admission except an adept. It is an Institution supported generally by the business people of the community who recognize Its useful ness as well as Its pleasurable enter tainment and It Is the very proper birthplace of a public sentiment that makes Prescott a prosperous and cul tured business center. ENGINEERS BANQUET AND TALK BUSINESS An Occasion of Pleasure and Profit For Skilled Men and Their Employes. Mention was made In yesterday' paper, of a meeting or Arizona Xo. 1 Association of Stationary Engineers, a branch of the Na tional Association of Stationary Engineers, which was attended by Fred W. Raven of Chicago, the nation al secretary as tho special guest of honor, and by a number of local gen tlemen, employes of the local engineers also as guests. An opening meeting In Veterans' hall Wednesday evening, was followed by a banquet at the Ford ho tel which lasted until a very late hour Beside the menu there was more or less speechmuking to improve the time nnd the occasion was an altogether felicitous one. The remarks of the national secretary Were in part, a-J follows: "It gives me great pleasure to come among you at this time and sec th condition in steam engineering which you hate to contend with which are many and you are to be congratulated on successfully operating plants under I such conditions. An engineer must ul all times have qualification of an ex ceptional character and If wo stop foe a moment to think what is required of 1111 engineer today the result is as tounding, but no true man will let ob stacles In the way prevent him from pushing to the front. Those who see": self-improvement do so to better their condition and this condlilon once ob talned makes a man broader and bet ter not only as an engineer, but as a, cltixen of this great republic. "When t body of men organize for honorable purposes It is lio more than right that. they give to the public th reason arm necessity for such organ- I Ld3 scs f mm Special Sale of Goats Today There's a lot of three-fourths length coats for ladies here marked $15.00 and $18 each.

A Probability That the Site of the Town Will Be Changed. to give publicity to the fact of his pos session of the pekin ducks and his desire to part with them. The Evening outcast ened in supposing that what the advertiser wanted was conceal ment and not publicity Id the former case. If he had desired to make a dark and Impenetrable secret of his posses sion of those ducks he might with propriety have inserted his "for sale" advertisement in the Evening Outcast. Hut a more simple proceduie would have been to lock the ducks in the smoke house or cellar and fasten a printed affidavit on the door setting forth that there were no ducks within and that if there were they were not for sale. By either process, by the concealment of his ownership of th' ducks by fastening them in the smoke house or cellar or by advertising them for sale In the Evening Outcast, the owner of the ducks would have ren-d-red himself Immune to annoyance by would-be purchasers of Pekin ducks. Another error in this connection which the Evening Outcast makes is the setting forth of itself as the "Peo ple's Organ. An organ In the eyes of a journalist is a thing to be detested and not to be proud of. The right kind of people do not want an oigan and th; wrong kind of people would make a bad use of it. Right thinking people I fear would confound a "People's Organ" with a public prostitute. A newspaper should never cheapen itself but should aim to preserve the same independence which makes banks and blacksmith shops and mercantile estab lishments successful and respected. Journalism, my dear children, is a pri vate business and nothing more. In which, if we are honest, we always give full value fr.r value received. I a;n grieied moreover to observe that some of you are puffed up with pride as you stumble along th Jour nalistic career. The Evening Outcas.1 is especially at fault in this matter and is given to childish boastfulness. For instance, I am told thpt it' pro fesses to be the leader In what ar called contests for securing subscrip tions. I 'do not know whether it Is 'iigaged in a contest or not. but I have been Informed that It has permitted itself to become implicated In some ahead. "There was one of the contestants, however, who arrested my attention early, partly by his stories, partly by his appearance. Out of the mist of years he comes to me now exactly as he appeared then. "His hair was thick, coarse and de fiant: it stood out in c-veiy direction. His features were massive, nose long, eyebrows protrusive. mouth large, cheeks hollow, eyes grey and always responsive to humor. He smiled all the time, but never once did he laugh outright. His hands were large, his arms slender and disproportionate ly long. His legs were a wonder, par ticularly when he was in narration; he kept crossing and uncrossing them; sometimes It actually seemed he was trying to tie them into a bowknot. His j dress was more than plain; no part of it fitted him. His shirt colh'r had come from the home laundry innocent of starch. The black cravat about his neck persisted in an ungovernable af finity with his left car. "Altogether I thought him the gaunt est, quaintest, and most positively ugiy man who had ever attracted me enough to call for study. Still, when he was In speech, my eyes did not quit his face. He held m: In unconsciousness. About midnight his competitors were disposed to give in: tither their stories were exhausted, or they were tactily conceding him the crown. From ans wering them story for story, he gave two or three to their one. At last he took the floor and held it. And. look ing back. I am now convinced that he frequently invented his replications, which is saying he possessed a mar vellous gift of improvisation. "Such was Abraham Lincoln. And to be perfectly candid, had one stood at my elbow that night In the old Inv ent and whispered: 'Look at him closely. He will one day be president nnd the savior of his country.' I had laughed at the idea but a little less heartily than I laughed at the man. "Afterward I came to know him bet ter, and then I did not laugh." -o The man who drinks to drown his sorrow says he faces misfortune with a "smile." Philadelphia Record. Polnmonville. Dec. 6. Details of the Clifton flood indicate a deplorable con dition of the residents. There Is an immense property loss, aggregating hundreds of thousands of dollars. It Is probable that the town will never be rebuilt on account of having four floods in three years. Practically every building is damaged and many were swept away. There were many narrow escapes from death, as the flood came without warning. Two men were caught In a store awning and broke through a plate glass window and escaped within. Patients in the hospital were carried to higher ground. Monday night was one of horror, and practically the en tire imputation was on the hills un sheltered. It is feared that many Mex icans were drowned. o
