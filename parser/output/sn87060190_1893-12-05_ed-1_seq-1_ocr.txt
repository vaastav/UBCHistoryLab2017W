Washington, Dec. 4. The message of President Cleveland was, spotter than usual, for him. containing but about 18,000 words. In brief it was as follows: To the Congress of the United Spates: The constitutional duty which requires the president from time to time to give to the congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consid eration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient, is fittingly en tered upon by commending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed state ments and well supported recommenda tions contained in the reports of the heads of departments, who are chiefly charged with tho executivo work Of the govern ment. In an effort to abridge this commu nication As much ns is consistent with its Mirpose, I shall supplement a brief refer- lice to the contents of these departmental veports by the mention of such executive business and incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such recommendations as ..appear to bo at this particular time appro priate. l'orelgn Relations. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been en tirely free from perplexity, no embarrass ing situation remains that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice, which, joined with consistent firmness, characterize a truly American forelgu policy. My predecessor having accepted tho office of arbitrator of the long standing missions boundary dispute, tendered to tho president by the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those stated to ay before me evidence and arguments in behalf of their respective governments. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in tho Republic of Brazil found tho United States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that country, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now, and for some time have been,, stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle being be tween the established government, which controls the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly rela tions, and certain ofllccrs of tho navy em ploying the vessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as it does, the ele ments of divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reason ably claim recognition as belligerants. Thus far the position of our government has been that of an attentive but Impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. Tho convention between our government and Chili, having for its object tho settlement and adjustment of the domands of the two countries against each other, has been made effective by the organization of the claims commission provided for. The two governments failing to acree upon the third member of the commission, the good offices of tho president the Swiss republic were invoked, as provided in tho treaty, and the selection of tho Swiss representative in this country to complete tho organization was gratifying alike to the United States and Chili. The vexatious question of po-called legation asylum for offenders against tho state and its laws was presented anew in Chili by the un authorized action of the late United States minister in receiving Into his official resi dence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pending, grow ing outof aformerabortlve disturbance, tho doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and, when allowed, tends to encourage se dition and strife. Under no circumstances can tho representatives of this government be permitted, under the il-defined fiction of extra territoriality, to interrupt tho ad ministration of criminal justice in tho countrios to which thoy arc accredited. A temperate demand having been made by tho Chilian government for the correction of this conduct in tho instance mentioned, the minister was instructed no longer to harbor the offenders. The legislation last year known as Tlje Geary Ijiw, ( quiring the registration of all Chinese la borers entitled to residence in the United States and tho deportation of all not com plying with tho provisions of the act with in the time prescribed, met with much op position from Chinese iu tills country. Acting upon tho advice of eminent counsel that tho law was unconstitutional, tho great mass of Chinese laborers, pending jurdicial inquiry as to its validity, in good faith declined lo apply for tho certificates "required by its provisions. A test case upon proceeding by hubeas corpus was brought before the supremo court, and, on May 15r 1893, a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining tho law. It is believed that under- the recent nmendmont of tho act extending the tinm for registration, tho Chinese laborer thereto entitled, who desiro to reside in this country, will now avail themselves of tho renewed prlvilego thus afforded of es tablishing by lawful procedure their right td rfimain, and that theroby the necessity of enforced deportation may to a great de gree be avoided. , , It has devolved upon the United States minister at Peking, as dean of tho diplo matic body, and in tho absence of n repre sentative of Sweedcn and Norway, to press upon tho Chineso government reperation for the recent inurder of Swedish mission aries at Sung Pu. Tho question is of vital interest to all countries whoso citizens en gage In missionary work in the Interior. By article 12 of tho general net of Brus sels, signed July 8, 1890, for tho suppres sion of the slave trade, and the restriction of certain injurious cqmmerco In tub inde pendent state df the Congo, and in thead lao&t apnt of Central Africa, the United $U tm'd the .other signatory powers ftXd,taadon.t apprpnriatejneans.ior the punishment or persons selling arms and ammunition to the natives and for tho confiscation of the inhibited articles. It being the plain duty of this govern, ment to aid in suppressing tho nefarious traffic, Impairing asit does the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts now in progress in that region, I recommend that an act be nassed prohibiting thb sale of arms and intoxi cants to natives in tho regulated zone by our cltlzeiis. , Costa Rica has lately testified its friendli ness by surrendering to the United States in the hbseneo of a convention of extradi tion, but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality a noted fugitive from justice. It is trusted that the negotiation of a treaty with that' country to meet recurring cases pi'tns kind wi,U soon be accomplished. In my opinion treaties for reciprocal ex tradition should be .concluded with all thoge countries with which the United Spates h&s hot already conventional ar rangements of that character. I have deemed it fitting to express to the govern ments of Costa Rica and Columbia the kindly desire of the United States to see their pending boundary dispute finally closed py arbitration In conformity with the spirit of tne treaty conclpdcd between thcriisouieYfearsagp. pur i flattens with the French republic continue to bo inti mate and cordial. I sincerely hope that the oxtradition treaty with that country, as amended by the senate, will soon bo operative. While occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth have arisen inourintercourso with Germany, our relations with that country continue satisfactory. The questions affecting our relations with Great Britatu have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations aro in progress between , tho two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Bearing sea tribunal of arbitration practically effective, and it is not doubted that Great Britain will co operate freely with this country for tho ac complishment ot tuat purpose. Tho dispute growing out pf the discrim Inatinc tolls of tho "welland canal, upon cargoes Of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of tho United States, was ad- J usted by tho substitution of a more equita do schedule of charges, and my predc cessor thereupon suspended "his nrocinma- tion imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit throiitth our canals. A request for additions to the list of ex traditable offenses covered by tho existing treaty between the two countries is under :onsidcration. During the past yenran American citizen employed in a subordinate commTci.il position in Hayti, after suffering a pro tracted imprisonment on an uniounueo tharce of smueirliiiK. was finally liberated upon judicial examination. Upon urgent representation to tho Haytlan government, n suitable indemnity was paid to thu suf ferer. By a law of Ilayti, a sailing veel having discharged her cargo, is refused clearance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The hardship of this measure upon American ship owners who conduct the bulk of tne carrying trade of that country has been insisted on with a view of securing tho removal of this cause oi complaint. Unon receivinK authentic information of tho Jiring upon an American mail steamer toiichingat the port of Amapala because her cantain refused to deliver up a passen ger in transit from Nicaragua to Guate mala upon demand of tho military authori ties of Honduras our minister to that coun try under instructions protested against the wanton act and demanded satisiactlon. The government of Honduras, actuated by a sense of justice and in a spirit of the ut most friendship, promptly disavowed the illegal conduct of its officers nnd expressed sincere regret for the occurrence. It is confidently anticipated that a satis factory adjustment will soon le reached of the questions arising out of the seizure and nso of American vessels by insurgents in Honduras and tho subsequent denial by tho successful government of commercial privileges to those vessels on that account. A notable part of the southeasterly coast of Liberia, between tho Cavally and San Pedro rivers, which for nearer half a cen tury has been generally recJJnized as bo longing to that republic by cession und purchase, has been claimed to be uuder the protectorate of France in virtue of agree ments entered into by tho native tribes over whom Liberia's control has not been well maintaaied. More recently negotiations between the Liberian representative and tho French government resulted in tho signature at Paris of a treaty whereby as au adjust ment certain Liberian territory is ceded to France. This convention at last advices had not been ratified by tho Liberian legis lature and executive. Feeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of the little commonwealth, the establishment and development of which were largely aided by the benevolence of our countrymen, and which constitutes tho only independently sovereign statw on tho west coast of Africa, this government has suKKestcd to tho French government its earnest concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia should take place without her unconstrained consent. Our relations with Mexico continue to bo of that cloao and friendly naturo which should always characterize tho intercourse of two neighboring republics. Tho work of re-locating tho monuments marking tho boundary oetween the two countries from Paso del Norte to tho Pacific Is now nearly completed. The commission recently organized un der tho conventions of 18&4 and 1881); it is expected, will speedily settle disputes growing out of the shifting currents of tho Rio Grande river east of El Paso. Nicaragua has recently parsed through two revolutions, the party at first success ful having in turn been displaced by an other. Our newly appointed minister, by his timely good offices, sided in a peaceful adjustment of the controversy Involved in tho lirst conflict. The largo American interests established in that country in connection with tho Nicaragua caiia' were not molested. The Nicaragua Canal company has un fortunately bscomo financially seriously embarasaed, but a generous treatment has been extended to it by the government of Nicaragua. The United fatates are es pecially Interested in tho successful achieve ment of the vast undertaking this company has in charge. That it should bo accom plished under distinctively American aus pices and Its enjoyment assured not oulyto the vessels of this country as a channel of communication between our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards but to tho ships of tho world in tho Interests of civilization, is a proposition which, in my judgmont, does not admit of question. Led by a desiro to compose differences and contribute to the restoration of order in Samoa, which for Bomo years previous had been the scene of conflicting foreign greteuslons and native strife, tho United tates, departing from Ita policy, conse crated by a century of observance, entered four yean iag into the treaty of Berlin, thereby.. becpmlng jointly, bound- with England and t" "mriny to establish nnd mnlntaln MnlluUui Lanpepa as king of Samoa. The treaty provided for a foreign court of justice; a municipal council for thu district of Apin, with a loreigu president thereof, authorized to advise the king; n tribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system for the kingdom. It entailed upon tho three powers that part of tho cost of tko new government not met by tho revenue of the islands. Early in tho life pf this triple protector ate thb native- dissensions, it was designed to quell, revived. Rivals defied the author ity of the new king, refusing to pay taxes and demanding the election of a ruler by nativb suffrage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a largo number of his na tive adherents were in open rebellion on one of the islands. Quito lately, at thb request of tho other fiowers, and in fulfillment of its treaty ob igations, tHs government agreed to unite in a joint military movement of such di mensions as would brobably secure the surrender of tho insurgents without blood shed. The warship Philadelphia was ac cordingly put under orders for Samoa, but before sho arrived tho threatened conflict was precipitated by King Mali etoa's attack upon the insurgent camp. Mataafa was defeated and a number of his men killed. The British und-German nav al vessels present subsequently secured tho surrender of Mataafa and his adherents. The defeated chief and 10 of his principal snpporters were deported to a German is laud of the Marshal group, where they aro held as prisoners under the joint responsi bility and cost of three powers. An extradition treaty with Norway has recently been exchanged and proclaimed. Hawaii. It is hardly necessary for me to state that tho quest ions arising from our relntions ith Hawaii have caused serious embar rassment, .fust prior to the installation of the present administration, tho existing government of Hawaii hod been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had lecn negotiated between the provisional government of tho islands nnd tho United Suites and submitted to tho senate for rati fication. TLls treaty I withdrew forexam iuation and dispatched Hon. James A. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner to mako tin impartial investigation of the circumstances attend ing tho change of government, and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of thu treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination, Mr. Blount submitted to mo his report, showing beyond all question that tho constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with tho active aid of our representatives to that govern ment and through the intimidation caused by the presuueo of an armed naval force of the United States, which was lunded for that purpose"at the instance of our min ister. Upon tho facts developed It seemed to me the only honorablctourse for our gov ernment to pursue was to undo tho wrong that had been done by those representing us and to restore as far as pmcticable tho status existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accomplish ing this result within tho constitutional limits of executive power and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed conditions, brought about by our unjustifiable inter ference, our present minister at Honolulu lias received appropriate Instructions to that end. Thus far no information of tho accomplishment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional advices aro soon expected. When received they will be promptly sent to the congress, together with all other in formation at hand, accompanied by a special executive message fully detailing nil tho facts necessary to a complete under standing of the case, and presenting a his tory of all tho material events leading up to the present situatiou. Arbitration. By a concurrent resolution, passed by the senate Feb. 14, 1890, and by the house of lepiesuut.itivvd on the Sd of April follow ing, tho president was requested "To in vite, from time to time, as fit occasion may arise, negotiations with any government with which the United States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or disputes arising between the two governments which can not be ad justed by dip'omatic agency may bo refer red to arbitration and bo peacablyadjusted by such meiins " April i, ibw, tne international Ameri can conference of Washington, by resolu tion, expressed the wish that all controver sies between cho republics of America nnd tho nations of Europe might bo settled by arbitration and recommended that tho gov ernment of ench nation represented in that conference should communicate this rdsh to all friendly powers. A favoralw re sponse has been received from Great Brit ain in the shape of a resolution adopted by parliament July 10 last, cordially sym pathizing with the purpose In view and ex pressinc tho hope that her majesty's gov ernment will lend ready co-operation to the government of tho United States upou the basis of the concurrent resolution above quoted. It affords me signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary resolution before tho con gress, and to express my sincere gratifica tion that the sentiment jpf two great nnd kindred nations Is thus authoritatively manifested in favor of tho rational and peaceable settlement of international quar rels by honorable resort to arbitration. Auibassurtors Since the passage of the act of March 3, 1803, authorizing tho president to raise the grade of our envoys to correspond with tho rank in which foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany have conferred upon tho representatives at this Capitol tho ti tle of ambassador, nnd have responded by accrediting the agents of tho United States in those countries with tho same title. A like elevation of mission is announced by Russia and vhen madowlll be similarly met. Tho step fittingly comports with tho position tho United States hold in the fam ily of nations. Ditring a former administration I took occasion to recommend a recast of tho Laws llelutin to the Consular Service In order that it might become a more efficient agency in tho promotion of tho in terests it was Intended to subserve. The duties and powers of consuls have been ex panded with tho growing requirements of our foreign trade, Discharging important duties affecting our commerce and Ameri can citizens abroad, and in certain countries exercising judicial functions, tlieso ofllcers should bo. men of character, intelligence and ability. Upon proof that tho legislation of Den mark secures copyright to" American citi zens pn equal footing with Its own, tho privileges of our copyright laws have been extended by proclamation to subjects of that country. Treasury. The secretary pt tlio treasury reports tout Uiq rjscelptatof the government from nil sources during tlio itScal year ended Juno 80, 1893, amounted to $101,710,501 01 and Its expenditures to $450,374,074.29. There was collected from customs $205,855, 010.73 and from internal revenue $101,027, G'23.03. Our dutiable imports amounted to 1421,850,711, an increase of $52,453,007 over the preceding year, and Importations free of duty amounting to $114,544,211, a de crease, from the preceding year of $13,455, 447. Iuternal revenue receipts exceeded those of the. preceding year by 87,147,445.83. On the first day or November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in circula tion, or not included in treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,082, an increase for the year of $112,404,047. Estimating our population at 07,420,000 at tho time mentioned, the per capita circulation was $25.49. On the same date there was in the treasury cold bullion amounting to $90,657,273, andaflver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $120,201, 553. The purchases of silver under tho law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal year, aggregated 54.008,103.59 line ounces, which cost $45,531,374.53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that the law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the first day of November, 1893, was 108,074,590.40 fine ounces, which cost $155,930,940.84. Between the first day of March, 1873, and the first day of November, 1808, the government purchased, under all laws, 503,003,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $518,022,948. The silver dollars that have beeu coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number 8O,0S7,2S5. Tho seigniorage arising from such coinage was $0,977,098 39, leaving on hand in the mints 140,699,700 fine ounces of silver, which cost $120,758,318. Our total coinage of all metals during the lnt. fiscal year consisted of 97,285, 875 pieces valued at $13,005,178 90, of which there are $30,035,140 in gold coin, $5,343,717 in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90 in subsidiary silvar coin, and $1,083,102.90 in minor coins. It is estimnted that on the first day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money in the United States, consisting of coin nnd bullion, amounted to $1,213,559,169. of which $597,097,085 was gold and $015,861,484 was silver. The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchaso of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our mon etary scheme has made au entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt that tho ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In tho nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at tins time precisely what conditions will bo brought about by the change, or what, if any, supplementary legislation may, in tho light of such con ditions, appear to be essential or expedient. Of course, after the recent financial per turbation, time is necessaiy for the rees tablishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence, tho money which has been frightened into hoarding places is returned to trnde and enterprise, a survey of tho situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently .round currency abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increasing population and business. In tho pursuit of this object wo should reso lutely turn away from allnriii'i and tem porary expedients, determined to be con tent with nothing less than a lasting und comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances, I am convinced that a reas onable delay in dealing with this subject Instead of being injurious will increase the probability of wise action. The Monotury Conference which assembled at Brussels upon our in vitation wts adjourned on the 30th day of November, in the present year. The considerations just stated nnd tho fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be expected from us upon tho re assembling of the conference, led us to ex press a willingness to have the meeting still further postponed. It seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the president to invite other nations to such a conference at any time .when there should be a fair pros pect of accomplishing an international agreement on the subject of coinage. I desire also to earnestly suggest the wis dom of amending the existing statutes in regard to the issuance of government bonds. Tho authority now vested in the secretary of treasury to issue bonds is not as clear as It should be, and tho bonds authorized, aro disadvantageous to tho government both ns to the time of their maturity and rate of interest. Tho superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, re ports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,793 immigrants. Of theto 1,003 were not permitted to land under the limitations of tho law, and 577 were returned to the countries from whence thoy came by reason of their having be come public charges. The total arrivals were 141,034 less than for the previous year. W "War. The secretory of war reports that the strength of thb army on tho 30th day of September last was 25,773 enlisted men and 2,144 officers. The total expenditures of the department for the vear ending June 30. 1693, amounted to $51,960,074.89. Of this sum $1,993,581.95 was for salaries and contingent expenses, $23,377,838.35 for the support of tho, mili tary establishment, $0,077,033.18 for miscel laneous objects and $20,515,031.41 for public works. This latter sum includes $15,290, 876.40 for river and harbor improvements, nnd $3,200,141.20 for fortifications and other works of defense. The totel enrollment of the militia of the several states was on tho 81st of October of the current year, 113,537 ofllccrs and en listed men. The oflicers of tho army de tailed for the inspection nnd instruction of thisreseiye of our military forco report that increased interest nnd marked prog ress are apparent in tlio discipline and efficiency of the organization. Neither Indian outbrenks nor domestic violence liavo called tho army into service during tho y ir, and tho only active mili tary duty required of it has been in the de partment of Texas, where violations of tho neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, eliciting tho warm up proval of the civil and military authorities of both countries. It is gratifying to note that wo havo bo gun to attain completed results In tho com prehensive scheme of sea coast defense and fortification, entered upon eight years ago. A largo sum has been already expended, but the cost of maintenance will bo incon siderable as compared with the expense of construction and ordnance. Tho manufacture of heavy ordnance keens pace with the current needs, but to render tly-'se guns available for tho pur poses they are designed to meet, emplace ments must he prepared for them. Pro gress has been made in tills direction, and it is desirahlo that congress, by adequate appropriations, should provide for tho un interrupted prosecution of this necessary work. After much preliminary work nnd exam ination Jn. accordance with the .require- Continued on Fourth Page. 

HAWAII HEARD FROM Tho Barkontine Klickitat Ar rives at Port Townsond. FOUR DAYS LATER NEWS. Everything Unlet, and Minister AVIUM Says That There Will lie No Change Tuke Place In tho Situation For Several "Weeks He Is "Waiting Further Instruc tions From "Washington, Port Iownsend, Wash., Dec. 5. The barkontine Klickitat, Captain Cut ler, has just arrived fro! Honolulu with advices to Nov. 20, four days after tho steamer Alameda sailed for San Francisco. In an interview published in Tho Evening Star Minister Willis is reported to havo said: "You nro authorized to state that no change in the present situation will take place for several weeks. I brought with me certain instructions from the United States government on tho Ha waiian situation. Since my arrival contingencies have arisen about which neither thd United States government nor myself were nwaro when I left Washington. I have thought best to jxerciso tho discrotion allowed, and submit those matters to Washington before proceeding further to carry out my original instructions. No ono need fear trouble and no lawlessness will be permitted." This statement gave the nnnexation Ub much satisfaction, and the royalists wero much displeased. On account of the many rumors current of tho con templatedjaction of the queen's support ers, the provisional government found it necessary to keep two companies of aoldiern under arms for several nights after the Alameda sailed. Tho editor of The Evening Star re quested Minister Willis to submit a stateineut to the pnblic to allay tho general feeling of uncertainty. In u published interview Mr. Willis said: "Yes. I believe that tho time has come when it is right and proper for me to use my discretion in thi8 matter. You are authorized tosayfoi aiethatno change iu tho present situation will take place for several weeks." Mr. Willis then made tho statement quoted above and added: "1 forwarded my dispatches to Washington by today's Bteamor, and until I receive an answer to them no chango will tnko place in the present situation, nor will any be allowed." "What do you mean by the expres sion 'nor will any be allowed V " "I must sa just this, that until the time comes for me to carry out my in structions the peace and good order of this community will be kept undisturbed in tho interests of humanity; that any nttempt mado by nny' person or persons to make trouble will be promptly checked and punished. "You may put the matter more plain ly, and say that even if the provisional government discharged all its troops today no lawlessness would be allowed for ono moment under the presont situ ation of nffairs. Tho whole Hawaiian question is now in abeyance, and noth ing that the newspapers can say or do will alter the situation ono iota. I make this statemont on my own re sponsibility and in tho hope that it will allay the presont excitement. No one need fear trouble and no lawlessness will bp permitted." After this statement rumors began to ily abput that tho quoon'B supporters would mako a final rally in her behalf. Tho crows of tho United States men-of-war Philadelphia and Adams were held in readiness to be landed on a moment's notice. Tho queen's advocate came out tho next day with a denial of tho Willis in terview, saying ho was misquoted, and by inference gave encouragement to the idea that Willis had or would re ceive an imperative order to restore the queen. Tho newspapers containing Blount's report had not reached tho islands when tho Klickitat miiled. Locomotive lUiiler Explode.
