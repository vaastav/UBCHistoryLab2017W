In as much as the benate is IJJepublican and the Uouse Democratic it need not bo expected that much legisla tion will be effected. It will however be a very active and important Congress as both of the gieat parties will place them- xulver in position for the great national contest of 1892. Governor Hill, of Now York, made a Npeeeh of great power at Elmira on Friday evening last. He aggres sively assails the .Republican party and Harrison's administration, and the Billion Dollar Congress. He declares that the Democrats of New York, including him self, favor free coinage of silver and of gold but on the ratio of the market value of the two metals. The coined silver dollar must be of equal value with the gold dollar.

A dispatch from Brazil, Ind says : Miners are gradually returning to work in the coal mines, in this district. Many who are needy say thoy will work at any prico in prefererco to suffer their children to go hungry. Miners are also returning to work in other mines. ST" The School Journal asks this pertinent question : "Should the teacher smoke?' The same question has been propounded concerning the minister, and there is a growing feeling that he should not; not that it is wrong, but whether it is unbecoming and injurious to the moral influence that the minister is expected to exert. There is the argument that St. Paul of old used : ' If eating meat causes my brother to offend I will eat no meat.' Certainly to the teacher who looks at tho little fellows gathering in his school room, habituated to the cigarette, little can be said if he finds it in his heart to do noth ing to rescue them. How pale and nervous they look ! The papers speak of one kept after school, who begged pite ously to be allowed to go out and smoke a dozen puffs, promising to come back and stay as long as the teacher should demand. It is a question of moral influence but there are other questions also." New Advertisements. Administrator's Notice II D. Stowe, Adminis trator, Henry Cathy. Ladie's Shoes Gilreath & Co.

The long looked for outline of the policy ol the Democrat party in this State, has been announced in the address of the Conference Committee which is printed elsewhere in this issue of The Democrat. The pacific character of the document in dealing with the farmers' grievances is very noticable. All that they could ask, is conceded when such requirements conform to public good and policy. A powerful force is given to the paper by this language: "Our friends must learn to discuss all ques tions concerning these matters in a spirit of fair ness, good will, and mutual confidence and es teem within the party lines, and when the time for action comes unite upon such men and such measures as seem most likely to lead us to victory." That is true democracy and by the observance of this appeal much rancor, and internal strife will bo averted. We advise every reader of The Democrat to peruse the article with care and thought fulness. . - Revolutionary Relic. Mr. James Moore, of this city, has left with Gen. R. Barringer quite a lot of old letters, receipts, and other documents running back and through the Revolu tionary war. Among them is one with the signature of Adam Alexander, one of the "signers." The names of the "signers" are now much sought after and Gen. Barringer is trying to make a complete set for the city Library. As showing the value of old relics, and the light they sometimes shed on past events, we copy an interesting story founded on a relic entitled, 'Faithful Unto Death." Judge Challes F. Cbisp was born at Sheffield, Eng., in 1845, of American parents who removed to Georgia the same year. Ho became a Confederate soldier while a mere boy, rose to the rank of lieutenant, was finally takeo prisoner and incarcerated at Fort Dela ware. After his release at the close of the war, Mr. Crisp studied law and be gan practicing at Ellaville, Ga. In 1877 he became Judge of the Supreme Court of the Southwestern Judicial Circuit. Although Mr. Crisp has been in Congress but four terms, he has risen to a position of commanding influence by reason of his great ability. He Las the judicial temperament strongly developed. N. C.

At 12:15 p. m., a poorly dressed man, carrying a brown satchel, entered the office of Russell Sage, Broadway, and demanded a private in terview with Mr. Sage. The man de manded a million of dollars from Mr. Sage, and upon being refused, he opened his hand bag, took out a dynamite bomb which he immediately hurled at Sage's head. A tremendous explosion followed The man who threw the bomb was blown to pieces. One of Sage's clerks was killed and several dangerously injured. Sage's injuries are only slight. New York, December 7. Russell Sage, in describing his meeting with the man who tried to blow him up with dyna mite, says : "The fellow handed me a paper. He was rather good looking, about thirty y.-ars of age, fairly well dressed, and with nothing about him to indicate the devil in his brain. "i took the paper and read this : "I demand of you $1,200,000, and if you do not give it to me at once, I have ten pounds of dynamite with which I will blow this building and its five hundred inhabitants to death.' "To say that I was thunderstruck would be putting it mildly, but 1 con trolled myself and said that I would see him in two minutes. As I was about to leave, he said, 'No, now.' I replied, Do I look like a man who would not keep his word ?' "For an answer he took out of his bag a large glass globo. This he held in his outstretched hand, ready to drop if the money was not instantly forthcoming. I took two steps backward, and they saved my life, for he immediately dropped the globe and a most terrific explosion followed." IST What tho Democratic party should aim at is victory in the Presidential contest. No attention should be given to questions that would make victory doubtful. Such questions may be impor tant, but it will be time enough to con sider them when the party gets into a position where it can act upon them and settle them. On the tariff issue it is certain to get control of the government. That is the vital issue, and the one to which it should give its whole attention in the national contest. Savannah News.

FROM OUR RALEIGH CORRESPONDENT. Raleigh, N. C, Dec. 8th, 1891. 1 Tho board 'of agriculture is certainly earnest in its endeavors to benefit the State and tho lending of its aid in the matter of securing a display of North Carolina's resources at the World's Fair is additional proof of this. The board will be able to utilize quite a sum of money for this purpose, but will of course have to be backed by every man in North Carolina who has the State's interests at heart. This is an old phrase, but means much. By unity of effort these North Carolinians can do almost anything; they can push their State far to the front. To tell the truth this State has never been fully represented, because some of the sections hunsr back. Now North Carolina must no longer have sections, but be solid. The board will have entire charge of the exhibit. It will utilize many of the articles in the museum, and will supplement these with a special collection of minerals in masses. The State Board of Education has given an option on no less than 700,000 acres of land in Hyde and adjacent counties to a syndicate of North Caro lina men. This is called swamp land, while in reality very little of it is swamp land. I talked the other day with H. M. Butters of Columbus county, who bought 40,000 acres of these lands and who has put the great sum of $250,000 into their development. He expresses himself as pleased with his venture. He has splendid timber and his mills cut up 100,000 feet a day. Little industries tell in this State as elsewhere. In the Magnolia section, Dup lin county, tuberose culture is a very im portant matter. It is the centre of that business in the United States. The bulbs are in three classes ; those ten inches in diameter selling at $9.00 per thousand. The yield per acre is some 60,000 bulbs, and these bring a return of something liko $350, on an average. That is a profitable crop. Some of the growers have fifty acres in cultivation. Chicago is the chief market. The bulbs are gathered, dried, in long houses and packed for shipment after having been graded. To nine out of ten people in the State, the facts hero stated will be news indeed The discovery of the true green sand, one of the most valuable of natural ferti lizers, has been made in New Hanover county, and no doubt tho beds extend into Pender also. This green sand has done a great deal for New Jersey. Its value is not fleeting. It lasts several seasons. The deposits so far found here are large and tho value high, The phos phate deposits are hardly touched as yet. Only at Castle Hayne, in New Hanover county is it mined, convicts will iu future do the rough work and 100 tons a day will be taken out. It goes to Raleigh, Richmond and Baltimore. The trustees of the agricultural and mechanical college have had a very satis factory meeting. The college is quite well supplied with funds and is flourish ing. Two domitories are nearly finished and the trustees decide to put up another, as there are notices that many new students are coming. The number will in six months reach 120, being now 108. The students are doing well, and the col lege is making a record. The railway commissioners left today for Wilmington and make their first tour of inspection over railways, of course they will receive complaints as they travel. The commissioners are conserva tive and prudent and have managed af fairs well. Their report for the nine months they have been in office is now nearly prepared. It will show a gain of $9,000,000 in the value of railway prop erty as assessed ; reduction of freights and fares, reduction of express and tele graph charges, etc. Yet on some arti cles freights are yet too high on car load lots of fertilizers, for instance. The supreme court will next week finish the regular call of cases, with the 12th district. Never were the dockets lighter. It is intimated that the court will not file its decision in the two cases involving the legality of the merchants' purchase tax until the holidays. I believe the court will decide the tax to be legal. L. L. Polk will in the future, his son in law tells me, confine himself much more closely to the duties of his office at Washington, and will not travel so much. It is not yet known who will be his new private secretary and he may not have one at all. There has been rumors that the State business agents of the Alliance was per sonally making a good thing out of that office, in the uhape of commissions and brokerage. Mr. W. H. Worth, the busi ness agent, tells me positively he has never made a cent out of the office. The brokerage goes to the executive com mittee of tho Alliance and pays the ex penses of maintaining the business agency and of keeping lecturers in the field. There is a brokerage on everything. That on fertilizers yielded $7,500 last year. The pension warrants are now all in the hands of the county authorities or of pensioners. Tho rapid distribution of some $85,000 just before the holiday sea son will make itself folt. "The people are not economical," said a leading business man today. "They are depressed by a reverse and declare the country ruined; or, elevated unduly by good fortune, spend their money with a lavish hand. The fault of 'hard times' rests largely with the body of the people. There is not enough thrift. The curse of cotton is upon the country. People in the State, who have little money, try to ape the manner of life of people North, who have plenty of money. The good crops last year caused a perfect rage for the purchase of new stock, vehicles, etc.; in a word all the eagerness and prodigality at tendant upon 'flush times.' Now the people are in a bad plight." The failure of the First National Bank of Wilmington, and the flight ot the cash ier, H. M. Bowden, were sensations of the last two weeks. It is said there was only $12,000 in cash in the bank. The depos itors will probably get their money. Some people say they will not get over 50 cents on the $1. That is probably an error. The bank at Clinton, a shaky affair and badly managed, went by the board. The stockholders are required by the State bank inspector to put up $50,000 to meet the deficiency. This must be done within 30 days. The case against the Durham(Alliance) fertilizer company results in a nonsuit and appeal by the department of agricul ture. The charge was made that the company defrauded the State by selling bags of fertilizer without tags, and cheat ed the buyers by selling goods below the standard. Several seizures were made. Tho matter has rnade a great stir, partic fauna txtt &lmvlotU, ularly as the Alliance was mixed up in j the business. Today your correspondent talked with President Marion Butler of the Farmers Alliance a:id asked some direct questions. Mr. Butler has always talked frankly with your correspondent. When asked "what do you think of the Third party in North Carolina?" he relpied: "As to that I have no information ; I know no more than you do. Of course the Third party is organized in the country at large, and may come even into North Carolina. As to that I cannot say. I have no means of knowing." "Did you ever see one of the circulars pledging Alliancemen to support the third party, which the Mecklenburg Times says are being 6ent out ?". was next asked ; to which Mr. Butler replied : 'I never saw one and never heard of one until I saw the matter published in the papers. I know the State Alliance never sent out any such circular and has noth ing whatever to do with it, and I also know that it is not sent out by the Na tional Alliance. Asked about the strength of the Alli ance, Mr. Butler said : "I estimate that in the eastern part of the State about 70 per cent, of the farmers are members. I take the counties of Duplin and Sampson as the basis for such a calculation. Why, in the town of Clinton there is a sub Alliance with one hundred and fifty members. In tho western part of the State the percentage is not so large and it. is there we are now doing our special work. The growth of the order will be in the addition to the membership of sub Alli ances now existing and now in new Alli ances. In the east tho membership is sufficiently large." Inquiry was made at tho Supreme Court as to the probable date of the de cision of the merchants' purchase tax cases, and it was stated that it would probably not be written until the holidays. If it were the correct thing to hazard a guess to the decision, your correspondent would say it would be in favor of the State. A number of clergymen from both Protestant Episcopal dioceses in North Carolina bo will here next week to attend the special services in honor of Bishop Lyman. The Episcopalians here have made extensive preparations for reception on that occasion. 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Harrison Opposes Tariff and Silver Legislation and asks for the Pas sage of the Force Bill. The openiDg paragraphs of the President's message to Congress, urges every member to read and deliently study the elaborate reports of the several departments. He declares that these reports will show that every question has been approached, considered and decided from the standpoint of public duty : The interest in the operations of the treasury department has been much augmented during the last year by reason of the conflicting evi dence of the tariff tnd other legislation of the last Congress aflectiDg the revenue as to the re suits of this legislation upon the treasury and upon the country on one hand, it was contended thit the Imports would so fall off as to Jetve the treasury bankrupt and that the prices of articles entering into the living of the people would be so enchanced as to disastrously affect their comfort and happiness while on the other it was argued that the loss to the revenue largely the result of placing sugar on the free list would be a direct gain to the people that the prices of the necessities of life including those most highly protected, would not be enhanced, that labor would have a larger market and the products of the farm advanced prices, which the treasury surplus and receipts would be adequate to meet the appropriations including the largest ex ceptional expenditures for the refunding to the States of the Direct Tax and the redemption of the 4 per cent bonds. It is not my purpose to enter at any length into a discussion of the effects of the legislation to which I have referred, but a brief examination of the statistics of the treasury and a general glance at the state of busiuess throughout the country will, I think, satisfy any impartial in quiry that its results have disappointed the evil prophecies of its opponents and in a large meas ure realized the hopeful predictions of its friends. Rarely, if ever before in the history of the country has there been a time when the proceeds of one day's labor, the product of one farmed acre would purchase so large an amount of those things that enter into the living of the masses of the people I believe that a full test will de velop the fact that the tariff act of the 51st Con gress is very favorable in its average effect on the prices of articles entering in to common use. There is certainly nothing in the condition of trade, foreign or domestic, there is certainly nothing in the condition of our people of any class to suggest that the existing tariff revenue legislation bears oppressively on the people or retards the commercial development of the na tion. It may be argued that your condition would be better if our tariff legislation were upon a free trade basis ; but it cannot be denied that all the conditions of prosperity and of general contentment are present in a larger degree than ever before in our history and that, too, just when it was prophesied that they would be in worst state. Agitation for radical changes in tariff and financial legislation cannot help but may seriously impede business, to the prosperity of which some degree of stability in legislation is essential. 

CREATED NEW INDUSTRIES. I think there are conclusive evidence that the new tariff has created several great industries which will within a few years give employment to several hundred thousand American working men and women. In view of the somewhat overcrowded condition of the labor market of the United States, every patriot citizen should rejoice at such a result. The report of the Secretary of the treasury shows that the total receipts of the government from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 20th, 1891, were $458.544,233 03, while the ex penditures for the same period were $421,804, 470.46, leaving a surplus of $37,239,763.57. The receipts of the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1892, actual and estimated are $433,000,000, and the expenditures are $409,000,000. For the fis cal year ending June 30th, 1893, the estimated receipts are $455,336,350 and the expenditures $440,300,000. THB FREE COINAGE OF SILVER WILL DISAS TROUSLY AFFECT OUS BUSINESS INTERESTS. I am still of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under existing conditions would disas trously affect our business interests at home and abroad. We couid not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power of the gold and silver dollar in our own markets and in foreign trade the stamp gives no added value to the bullion contained in coins. The producers of the country, its farmers and laborers, have the highest interest that every dollar, paper or coin, issued by the government shall be as good as any other. If there is one less valuable than another its sure and constant errand will be to pay them for their toil and for their crops. The money lender will protect himself by stipulation for payment in geld, but the laborer has never been able to do that. To place business on a silver basis would mean a sudden and severe contraction of the cur rency by the withdrawal of gold and gold notes of such an unsettling of all values as would pro duce a commercial panic. I cannot believe that a people so strong and prosperous as onra will promote such a policy. The producers of silver are entitled to just consideration, but they should not forget that the government is now buying and putting out of the market the equivalent of the product of our entire silver mines. This is more than they themselves thought of asking two years ago. I believe it is the earnest desire of a great majority of the people, as is mine, that a full com use shall be made of silver just as Boon as the cooperation of other nations can be secured and a ration fixed that will give cir culation equally to gold and Bilver. The busi ness of the world requires the use of both metals, but I do not see any prospects of gain, but much of loss by giving up the present system in which a full use is made of gold and a large use of silver for one in which silver alone will circu late. Such an event would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silver movement. Bimetalism is the desired end. The true friends of silver will be cartful not to overrun the goid and bring in silver Toono metalism with its oecessarv attendants, the loss of our gold to Europe and relieve the pres sure, mereiore a larger currency. I have en deavored by the use of official and unofficial agencies to keep a close observation of the state of public sentiment in Europe of this question ana nave not iouna n to De such as to justiry me in proposing an international conference. There is, however, sentiment in favor of a larger use of silver, and I know of no more effectual way of promoting this sentiment, than by accumulating gold here, a scarcity of gold in Europe and rese voirs will be the most persuasive arguments for me use oi silver. The exports of gold to Europe, which began in February last and continued to. the close of July, aggregated over 70,000,000. The net loss of gold during the fiscal year was nearly $68, 000,000. That no serious monetary disturbance resulted was most gratifying and gave to Europe fresh evidence of strength and stability of our financial institutions. With the movement of crops, the outflow of gold was stopped and the return set in. Up to December 1st, we have recovered of our gold loss at the port of New York $27,854,000 and it is onfidently believed that during the winter and spring this aggregate will be steadily and largely increased. I hope the depression in the price of silver is temporary and that a further trial of this legisla tion may meet favorably with the affect, that the increased volume of currency thus supplied for the people was needed, and that beneficial results upon trade and price have followed this legisla tion, I think must be very clear to every one, nor should it be forgotten that for every dollar of these notes issued, a full dollar's worth of silver bullion is deposited in the treasury as security for its redemption. Upon this subject as upon the tariff my recom mendation is that the existing laws be given a full trial and that our business interests be spared the distressing influence which threats of a radical change always impart Under the ex isting legislation, it is in the power of the Treasury department to maintain that the essen tial condition of the national finance as well as of commercial prosperity, the parity in use of the coin dollars and their paper representatives. The assurance that these cowers would be freely and unhesitatingly used has done much to pro duce and sustain the present business favorable conditions. FOR THE 

FORCE BILL AGAIN. The unfailing test of sincerity in election re forms will be found in a willingness to confer as to remedies and to put into force such meas ures as will most effectually preserve free and equal representation. An attempt was made in the last Congress to bring to bear the constitu tional powers of the general government for the corrections of frauds against suffrage and it is important to know whether the opposition to such measures in reality, rested in particular features supposed to be objectionable or includes any proposition to give to the election laws of the United States adequacy to the correction of grave and acknowledged evils. I must yet entertain the hope that it is yet pos sible to secure a calm, patriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory changes as may be necessary to a choice of officers of the Govern ment to the people by fair appointments and full elections. I believe it would be possible to con stitute a commission non partisan in its member ship, and composed of patriotic, wise and im partial men to whom a consideration of the question of the evils connected with our election system and methods might be committed with a good prospect of securing unanimity of plan for removing or mitigating those evils. The constitution would permit the selection of the commission to be vested in the Supreme Court if that method would give the best guar anty of impartiality. This commission should be charged with the duty of inquiring into the whole subject ot the law of elections, as related to the choice of officers of the national government with a view to securing to every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as is attainable. While the policies of the general government upon the tariff, upon the restoration of our mer chant marine, upon river and harbor improve ments, and other such matters of grave and gen eral concern are liable to be turned this way or that by the result of congressional elections and administration policies, sometimes involving is sues that tend to peace or war, to be turned this way or that by the results of a presidential elec tion, there is a rightful interest in all the States and in every Congressional district that will not be deceived or silenced by the audacious pretense that the question of the right of any body of legal voters in any State or in any Congressional district to give their suffrages freely upon these general questions is a matter only of local con cern or control. The demand that the limitations of suffrage shall be found in the law and only there is a just demand and no just man should resent or re sist it. My appeal is and will continue to be, for a consultation that shall "proceed with can dor, calmness and patience upon the lines of jus tice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty." To the consideration of these very grave ques tions, I invite not only the attention of Congress, but that of all patriotic citizens. We must not entertain the delusion that our people have ceased to regard a free ballot and equal representation as the price of their allegiance to laws and to civil magistration. The Lojal Volunteers. In an article on "The Degradation of Pensions" in this month's Forum Lieu tenant Allen R. Foote says that the Society of Loyal Volunteers, of which he is one of the organizers, is ready to sup. port a measure basing pensions entirely on impairment of earning capacity. Shot through the lungs at Fair Oaks, he himself has drawn a pension which he accepted as "a token of the gratitude of the Government, though he is earning $6 a day. rle is far more justly entitled to this pension than are many others who receive larger amounts, and it is perfectly legal, for he is so "physically disabled" that be could not earn a living as a ditcher or a hod-carrier. But after second thought he has concluded that the only just basis for pension is such disability incurred in service that the applicant for pension cannot be a self supporting American citizen. "The good ot society," he says, "demands that honor shall be levelled up and not graded down. It is a law of nature that all men shall earn their own living. Every quality of character that tends to make men indus trious, thrifty, true and noble is strength ened by compliance with this law. That man is most valuable to himself and to society who complies with the require ments of this law most cheerfully and with greatest intelligence. All honorable men will say instinctively that a man who is not willing to render a valuable service in fair exchange tor tho means ot a comfortable support, when such opportunity is offered him, is unworthy of respect and not entitled to sympathy. He is a self-made pauper." To emphasize the distinction between this view of what conditions ought to be and what they really are at present he fives these figures from the report of the ension Bureau for the year ending July 30, 1891 : Number of pensions in force 676,160 Number of claimants not on rolls 559,027 TCnmhpr nf nersons nensioned or seeking to be pensioned 1,235,187 The principle which has produced these astounding result is that of a military socialism Dure and si mole. The entire population of all the States, including men, women and children, whites, negroes and Indians, was onlv 31.000.000 in 1860. So that the number of pensioners and applicants for pensions is now, thirty years later, only a very little under 4 per rant, of the total nonulation of North and South, East and West in the year of Lincoln's first election, it was nign time for the Loyal Volunteers to Degin tomase themselves lelt.

A. Bell, Commissioner in the suit of R. Barringer vs. W. G. Maxwell and others, and brought $150 more thai; at first sale. The sale being for cash, would indicate, that after all, money is not bo very scarce, nor real estate, as yet affected, in price, lien. Barringer was the purchaser, and the land is now offered for rent by him. See ad. Countt Commissioners. The County Com missioners met on Monday. Capt. T. L.

Perhaps it may not be generally known. says' the Boston Journal of Commerce, but the importation of cotton is on the increase, not only irom Egypt, but from Peru, East India, and China, at prices that would seem to be comparatively high. The classified importations for 1889-90, show that 20,000 pounds were received direct from East India in that year, and 301,623 pounds from Peru, in addition to whatever the receipts may have been via England. There is some thing about these coarse or rough cottons that makes them peculiarly well adapted to mix with wool. It would seem as though they possessed characteristics superior to American cotton for affiliation with wool for which their purchase is made. It may be seriously asked why two cents a pound will be paid for East Indian cotton, f to i inch staple, more than for the same grade of American cotton, 7 8 to 1-inch staple? Yet this difference is paid by American woolen manufacturers for a reason satisfactory to themselves. Mistranslations. Where would be the popular teachings about hell if we calmly and deliberately erased from our English Bible the threo words, "damna tion" "hell" and "everlasting ?" Yet I say unhesitatingly I say, claiming the fullest right to speak with the authority of knowledge I say, with the calmest and most unflinching sense of responsi bility I say, standing in the sight of txod and my avior, and it may be of the angels and spirits of the dead, that not one of these words ought to stand any longer in our English Bible, lor by our present acception of them they are simply mistranslations.
