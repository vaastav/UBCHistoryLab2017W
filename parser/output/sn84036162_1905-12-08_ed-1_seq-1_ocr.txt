THE HAVRE HERALD VoL. 2, No. 23. HAVRE, CROUTE'A' COUNTY, MONTANA, FRIDAY, DEL EMBER 8, 11105. 82.00 PER YEAR. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Federal Control of Railroads, an Elastic Currency, Tariff, Labor Problems, Peace Conference and the Monroe Doctrine Discussed. President Roosevelt's annual message has been delivered to congress. Open ing with a plea for the co-operation of all classes in continuing the country's prosperity and in correcting existing evils, for a "square deal" for every body, the message first takes up the question of corporations and railroad rate legislation. The president says: Corporations. I am in no sense hostile to corpora tions. This is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all combina tion will be not only useless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which the failure to ehforce law inevitably produces. The corpora tion has come to stay, just as the trades union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts against law and Justice. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by state ac tion. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex tensive with the field work of the cor porations-that is, by the national gov ernment. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the na tional government by affirmative ac ment of the constitution. The laws of the congress and of the .everal states hitherto, as-pasised upo : by the courts, have resulted more often in showing that the states have no power in the matter than that the na tional government has power; so that there at present exists a very unfortu nate condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an in terstate business occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national government having effective control over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the na tional government by affirmative nc ti0.n This is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely a restoration, for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies, and all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it has always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also in England before and since this country became a separate nation. Railroad Rate Legislatloin. As 1 said in my message of Dec. Ii last, the immediate and most pressing need so far as legislation is concerned is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision and regu lation of the rates charged by the rail roads of the country engaged in inter state traffic as shall summarily and ef fectively prevent the imposition of un just or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to re bates in every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with moderation, caution and self restraint, but it should exist, so that it can be effectively exercised when the need arises. In my judgment, the most important provision which such law should con tain is that conferring upon some com petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought before it whether a given rate pro scribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found to be unreason able and unjust then, after full investi gation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go--the maximum reasonable rate, as it Is commonly call ed--this decision to go into effect with in a reasolt:tb-l tilmet and to obtain front lthotce ot\v:aIrd, sitbject to review by the collrs. It socItities halppen at resentll, not that a rate is too high. but that a fit vorti slhilpper is given too low a rate. In such case the inommission would have the right to lix this already estab lished nlilniium rate, as the maxinimu. and it wiotll n-ted only out' or two such decisiotns ly the otlillniission to cure railroad comlpanies of 111t ipraictce of gi itng improper nilltitllllnl rales. I call vyotur attention to the fact that Uly lro posal is not to give the .ill tnissionl powelor to initiate or originate rltes gen ora:lly. it io ri-wil'ato a r:tte already fixed or originated by the roaids upon complaint and after investigation. A heavy penalty should be exacted from any corporation which falls to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation. It is worth while considering whether it would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for ht least twice the value of the rebate. iTihls would help stop what is really ackmail. Elevator allowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demor alizing and are used as rebates. Private Car Lines. All private car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges and Ihe like should be expressly put under the su pervision of the interstate commerce commission or some similar bodtly so far as rates and agreements pratileil ly affecting rates are coic'ernedl. A re bate in icing charges or in mileage or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a re bate in any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers. Only in this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detectected. A system of examltation of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted into the national innks by the bank examiners. . few first el-ss railroad accountants, if they had pro,,p er direction and proper authotrity to in spect iooks and papers, could :cc(:om plish much in provenling wTilful viola tions of the law. Employers' Liability Law. In ny annual message t.o lth.i ifty+ eighth congress at its second session I recommended the passage of an cm ployers' liability law for the Distri t of Columbia and in our navy yards. I re newed that recommendation in lmy message to the Fifty-eighth congress at. its second session and further suggest ed the appointment of a commission to make a cot prehensive study of en ployers' liability with a view to the en actment of a wise and constitutional law covering the subject, applicable to all industries within Ihe scope of the federal power. I hope that such a law will be prepared an:d enacted as speed ily as possible. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of our courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judges have misused this power, but this does not justify a denial of the power any more than an improper ex ercise of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The remedy Is to regulate the lprocedure by requiring the judge to give dute notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What is due notice must depend upon the facts of the case. It should not )be used as a pretext to per mit violation of law or the jeopardiz ing of life or property. Of course this would not authorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case in which it is not already author ized by existing law. I renew the recommendation 1 made in my last annual message for an in vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of' child labor and child labor legislaition In the several states. Suclh an investig:tion should take into account the va rious problems with whilh the lquestion of child labor is conned ed. Inl such a relpublic as ours the one thing tlat:, we canlnot afford to neglect is ithi problem of turning out decent citizens. The future of the na tion depends upon the citizenship of the generatlions to onle. The children of todlay are those who tomorrow-will shape the delstiny of our land, and we cannot afford to negtlect them. The leg islature of ('olorlad has recommended that thel Ilt li)ltnal goverumllnt prosvide soIei general lIoasure for the prote. tioi firout otue of children antd dumnb animial. thiughiottt the ltiited States.
