Fordney Bill Wai Be Recast To Suit Harding Senator Smoot, Following Talk With President. Offers Amendments to Meet Executive"? Ideas Flexibility To Be Keynote Revised Measure Also Would Apply American Valua? tion Only When Essential y*-0m The Tn^unr's Washington Burea? WASHINGTON, Dec. ?.-Recasting of the Fordney tariff bill in many im? portant respects is deemed sure to follow on the recommendations of President Harding- in his annual mea <ajsre to Congress to-day. The President presented ideas for meeting the chaotic conditions abroad, whieh are much at variance with the bill as it passed the House. He would have a highly flexible tariff, one which the Executive, or? the strength of in? formation from the tariff commission, can rai?e and lower as may be neces? sary; he would apply American valua? tion only when essential and would meet depreciated currencies by the raising of duties to correspond. President Hardies, before taking his position on tariff, conferred with lead? ers on the Finance Committee of the >enate. ami among otners met Senator Sir.oot arui went into detail on the subject with him. Senator Smoot for some time has advocated changes in the bill along the lines suggested by the President. Furthermore, as soon as the Senate reconvened, following the delivery of the message, Senator Smoot offered amendments to carry into effect ?he ideas of the Executive. Gives President Power One of the amendments authorizes ?he President to increase and decrease duties. Another enables the President -o ?x duties which will equalize con? ditions caused by depreciated currency. A th?r? authorizes the President -in eases wherein he deems it necessary 10 apply American valuation. This amendment is founded on the idea that t?ongre;s will restore the foreign mar? ket vaiue as the basis for the assess? ment of 'id valorem duties. ?e~.:\\.nr Smoot also introduced a fourth amendment which covers all three of these points and provides that when in his judgment the public wel :":.re may require, the President shall direct that investigation be made of ons affecting competition in the American market between foreign and : ime tic producers of any article or If the President finds that he duties under the law do not equal? ize the advantages of the foreign and domestic producers he shall increase duties, apply American valuation or :aise duties to meet depreciation of foreign currency. This amendment pro .des that the total increase or de '?rease of such duties shall not exceed ."'! per cent. Follows Harding's Idea The purpose of my amendments," nator Smoot, 'is t > carry out the recommendations as to tariff contained i.; the message of the President. "The amendment on American valua? tion is a modification of the House plan. in many lines of goods tho American valuation is not necessary. The House provision would apply to it everything in the bill. My amendment would ap? ply it oniy when the President on in? vestigation found it to be necessary. "The President, under one of my : mendments, would be authorized to examine into the difference in condi ". ona here and abroad and increase du : es or decrease them. Conditions now may not be the same as they will be six months from now-, and it might be necessary to raise or lower duties to meet the change. Under one of the amendments the President is given power to take account of depreciated currency in any country abroad and mod::";.- duties to meet such a condi? tion."
