I con- mlnUtrattve abuses to which the atten tion of Cocrrc should be asked In this connection. llere partisan appMntmenU and theoonstant peril of removal without oauae, yeiy naturally lead to anabsorb lag and mUchUvoua political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which not only interfere with the doe discharge orofacial duty, DUtia inuuiap.-ui w.w the freedom of elections. Hot without warrant, In the views ot several or my Sredeoeasore tn the Presidential otHoe, Irectly within the law of 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by regulation, made on the22d day of June. 1877, to put some reasonable limits to such abuse,, It may not be easy, and It may neverTperhaps, be necessary, to define with prec'alon the nmnar limit or nouuoai actum uu toe part of Federal officers. But while their right to hold and freely express their opinions cannot be questioned, It Is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to otoer suDjeois we time nwuou fhr the nroner dlschanre of their official dntlM. nor to use the authorltv of their ofiloe to enforce their own opinions, or to ooeroe the polltioal action of those who hold different opinions.

Dy a proper exercise ot authority, t la In the power of the Executive to do much to promote auoh a reform. But it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can do aooompiweu without co-operation on the part of Con gress and considerate and intelligent sup port among the people. Keforms whlon challenge the generally accepted theo ries of parties and demand, ebangee in tne metnoaa oi oepwunBuw work of a day. Their permanent loun datlons must be laid In auch principles, and In an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the ' rrrors or their adversaries. Every worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an honor to his country, but the peo ple themselves, far more than their offl cera in publlo station, are interested in a pure economical and vigorous admin istration.

CIVIL SXRVIC BKyOBM. Inatormer message I invited the at tention of Congress to the subject of the Jr.ti,,r, J thA civil service of the government, and expressed the intention Itfrrnamittinr to CongroBa as early as this subject examiners, were provided tor and made Ann titlnn rf sdmlaslon to the PUbllC ervioe. These sututes are a decision by Congress that examinations of some sort, as to atUlnmenU and capaaitjvere essen tial to the well being ot the publlo ser vioe. The important question since the enactment ot these Uws hare been as to the character of these examinations, ana whether official favor and partisan Influ ence, or common right and merit, were to control the access to the examina tions. In practice these examinations have not alwaya been open to worthy persons generally, who might wish to be examined. Official favoritism and par tisan influence, as a rale, appear to have designated those who alone were permit ted to go Derore we exaunuiu uumu, iiAnnr Ann the examiners to a pres- mart from the friends ol the candidates fM as anv other citizen to give hi own money in aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other ultl sen to refuse to make such gifts. If sal aries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the offloer, it Is gro injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made exoeeslve in order tint they may bear the tax, the exaesa is an Indirect robbery of the publlo Mnds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present aUtutes as shall MAnMtn those in eveiv crade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened na tion should guard those who are faithful in 1U aervioe.

In view of this reoult, I entertain a confi dent expectation that the prevalence oi quiet on the border will eoon become so assured as to Justify a modification of the present orders to our military command ers as to crossing the border, without en oouraging such disturbances as would endanger he peace or the two countries. The third lnsUllmentef the award against Mexico under the Claims Commlnf lou of July 4, 1868, was duly pal J, and has been put in course or distribution la pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the same.

The channel through the South Pass, which, at the beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only seven and one-half feet of water, had, on the 8th ot July, 1879, a minimum depth of tweuty-elx feet, having a width of not leu than two hundred feet and a central depth of thirty feet. PaymenU have been in accordance with the sUtute, as the work progressed, amounting in the aggregate to 4,250,000; and further payrnenu will be come due, as provided by sUtute, in the event of success in maintaining tne cnannei now secured. The reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates, present a full and detailed account of the mlllUry opera tions for the suppression ot hostUitlas among the Indians of the Ut and Apache tribes, and praise is Justly awarded to the officers and troops engaged, for4romptnes, skill, and courage displayed. The past year has been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there Is reason to be lieve that the efforts of this government and of Mexico, to malnUIn order in tbat region, will prove permanently successful.

THE NAVY. .This department was enabled during the past year to find temporary though crowded accommodations, and a safe depository for a portion of its records, in the completed east wing ot the building designed for the SUte, War and rsavy impairments, mo con struction of the north wing ot the building, a nart of the structure intended for the use of the War Department, is being carried for ward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive srom Congress such liberal appropriations as will secure us speedy com iMtlnn. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement in tbat branch ot the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels and two new ships have been com pleted and made ready for sea. The total ex penditures of the year ended June 80, 1879, including ipeciflc appropriations not esti mated for by the department, were 113,555, 710 09. The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amount of these specific nnronrlatlons. were 113,343,317.79: but this is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon war rants, but not paid out during the year. The amount ot appropriations applicable to the last fiscsl year was $14,538,64 17. There wss, therefore, a balance of 11,479, 065 87 remaining unexpended, and to the t. nt the derailment on June 80, 1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ended June 80, 1881, are $14,84,147 95, which exceed the appropriations for the present fiscal year 1361,897 28. The reason tor this increase is explained in the Secretary's report. The ap propriations available for the present fiscal year are $14,502,250 67, which will, in the opinion of the SecreUry, answer all the ordi nary demanas oi me semce. uo uu drawn from the treasury from July 1 to No vember 1, 1879, wss $5,770,404 13, of which $1,095,440 83 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,674, 896 79. If the expenditures of the remain ing two-thirds of the year do not exceed the proportion for these four months there will remain unexpended, at the end of the year, $477,359 80 of the current appropriations. The report of the SecreUry shows the gratify ing fact that among all the disbursing officers aAnradatlnn. althouifU sucn cases stui occur, has been greatly reduced la extent, and. it is., probable that if the present policy is vigorous- . ly pursued and sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress, such trespasses, at least those on a Urge scale, can be entirely sup- Eressed, except In the Territories where tim er for the dally requlremenU of the popula tion cannot, under the present state ot the lew, be otherwise obUiued. I therefore ear- nestly Invite the attention of Congress to the recomendatton made by the secretary ot the Interior, that a Uw be enacted enabling the ... government to sell timber from . the public lands without conveying the fee, where such lands are DrinclDallv valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to ... conform to domestic wsnts and business re quirements, while at the same time guarding . against a sweeping destruction of the foresU. - The enactment of such a law appears to be come a more pressing necessity every day. , - .. A0B1CCLTVRB. My reconuneudations in former . messages . are renewed In favor of enlarging the facilities . of the Department ot Agriculture. Agricul ture is the leading interest snd the permanent ,. industry of our people. It is to the abund- . anceof agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely increased snd highly proflUble market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that a ar maliilr indebted for our present pros perity as a people. We must look for its ! continued malntensnce to the same subnUn tlal resource.". There ! no branch of indus try in which labor, directed by scientific knowledge yields such increased production tn ( j comparison with unskilled f labor, and no . braneh ot the public service to which the en couragement, of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately extenaeu. jw , " recommended by the Postmaster-General, the appropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be made lu gross. . The Postmaster-General reommends an amendment of the law regulating the Increase of compensation for increased service and in creased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to advertlMS for propola for such in creased service and speed. He also suggests the advantage to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enactment of a general law authorizing coutracU with American-built steamers, carrying ,the American flag, for transporting tbe mall between ports ot the United States and ports of the West Indies and South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regu lated by annual appropriations, in like man ner with the amount paid for the domestic star arvt. The arrangemeut made by the Post master-General and the Secretary of the Treas ury for tbe collection oi outy upon doom re ceived in the mall from foreign countries has proved so sstlsfactory in IU practical opera tion that the recommendation Is now made that Congress shall extend the provisions of the act of March 8, 1879, under which this arrangement was made, so to as apply to all oth er dutiable articles received In the malls from foreign countries. The reports of . the Secre Ury of the interior ana ot ww vuuu""' of Indian Affairs, setting from the present sUteof our relations with tbe Indian tribes on M1. .rriirv. the measures Uken to advance their cUUizatlon and prosparity, and the pro- rentu,r eUch aid is not wise economy; cress already achieved by them, will be found on contrary. undoubtedly results in losses of B .. i . a m.. mmm1 I . .i..i Iat Ka .aval nf more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory that the occurrence of two dis turbances, which resulted in bloodshed and de struction, Is all the more to be lamented. The history ot the outbreak on tbe White Blvei Ute reservation in western uoiorauu u uc come so famllar by elaborate reports in the Dublic press, that Its remarkable incidents need not be stated nere m aetau. n eycy ed that the settlement ot this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indians and the border settlements in Western Color ado. The other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a small band of maraud ers, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by arailiUry force made his wsy across the Mexican border and is now on foreign sou. immense sums annually that? might be saved through well-directed efforts by, the goverp, meut to promote this vital . interest. 4 The re suits already accomplished with the tery lim- .v ited means heretofore placed at the command. of the Department ot Agriculture Is au earn-" est of what may be 'expeeted with increased appropriations for tbe several purposes indi- " cated In the report of tbe Commissioner, with i a view to placing the department upon a foot-, lng which will enable it to prosecute' more effectively the objects for which it Is esUb lished. Appropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the ,esUbli8h ment ot. a veterinary division, and a fn r of forestry, and for an increase of torce. The . rantilrfunentsfor theser and' other purposes, . indicated in tbe report of tbe Commlsioner under the head of the immediate necceasitiee of the department,' will not Involve any ex-. pendlture of money that the country cannot , with propriety now unaenr hi u v r l a reign suu. . .

Tbe "Indian policy" sketched in the report of the SecreUry of the Interior, the object ot which is to make liberal provis ion for the education of Indian youth, to set tie the Indians upon farm-loU in severalty, to give them title in tee to their farms, inaliena ble for a certain number ot years, and when their wanU are thus provided for, to dispone by sale of the lands on their reservations not occupied and nsed by them, a fund to be formed out oi the procceus ior umj the Indians, which will gradually relieve the and in. the District of Columbia. Tbe wise . forethought of the founders of our govern ment has not only furnished the basis for the support of the common school systems of the newer SUtes, but laid the foundations tor the maintenance of their universities and colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts.

DEPARTMENT OT JT8TICX. The appropriation for Judicial expenses, which has heretofore been made for the De partment of Justice, in gross, was subdivided at the last session of Congress, and no appro priation whatever was made for the payment of tbe fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the service of process or for the dls ch.wra of other duties; and since Jane 80th, these officers have continued the performance of their duties, without compensation from tbe government, Uklng upon themselves the necessary incidental outlays, as well as render ing their own services. In only a few unavoid able insUnces, has the proper execution ot the process ot the United SUtes failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriatlor. This course of official conduct on the part of these offlcers,highly credlUble to tneir naeiity, was advised by the Attorney-General, who in formed them, however, that they would neces sarily have to rely for their compensation up- self as Just and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove uioseowovruvwuiut which the existence of large reservations pre sente to the settlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recom mend the enactment of a law enabling the gov ernment to give Indians a title in fee, inalien able for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to tbera by allotment, i aiso rc ,.-, the recommendation made ln my first annual messsge, that a law be passed admitting In dians who ean give satisfactory proof ot hay ing, by their own labor, supported their f.miiioa far a number of vears, and who are willing to detatch themselves from their tri-. bal relations, to the benefit of the Homestead act, and to grant them patenU containing the same provision of inalienability for a certain period.

" No appropriation was made for this pur pose for the current year. Ana no grue election for members ot Congress occurred, tbe ommlsslon was a matter of little practical im portance. Such elections wiu, nowever, place during the ensuing year, and the appro priation made for the pay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to embrsce com pensstlon for the services that may be requir ed to perform at such elections. The business ofthe Supreme Court Is, at present, largely ln arrears. It csnnot be expected that more causes can be decided than are now disposed of at IU annual session, or that by any assidu ity the distinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more than is now ous tribes, and is in full operation. Arrange ments are also made tor the education ot a number of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the Pacific slope, ln a similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institu tions will commend themselves to the liberal ity ot Congress, and to the philanthropic munificence ofthe American people. Last spring information was received of the organization of an extensive movement hi the Western 8Utes, the object of .which was 11.. rw.onn.tinn bv unauthorized persous ot certain lands ln the Indisn Territory ceded by the Cherokees to the government for the pur pose of settlement by other Indian tribes. n5n the 29 of April I Issued a proclamation warning all persons against participation m such an attempt, and by the co-operation of a miliury force the Invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the rlgbU of the Indian InhablUnU of that Terri tory to the full extent It the Uxcutive power. But It would be unwise to ignore -the fact that a Territory so lsrge and so fertile, witli a population so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such at- tempU as happened tnis year, wneu wic sur rounding Sutes are more densely settled, and tutlon, call for building accommoaaiions which shall be at once adequate and lire-proof. The location of such a public building, which should provide tor the pressing necessities of the present, and for the vast increase of the nation's books ln the future, is a matter which addresses itselt to the discretion ot Congress. It is earnestly recommended as a measure which should unite all suffrages, and which should no longer be delsyed. The Joint Com mission created by the act of Congress of Annit 2. 1878. for the purpose ot supervis ing and directing the completion of the Wash ington National Monument, ot which commie- , sion the President is a member has given careful attention to this subject, and already the strengthening ot tbe foundation has so far progressed as to Insure the entire success of this part of the work. A massive layer of masonry has been Introduced below the orig inal foundation, widening the base, Increas ing the sublllty ofthe structure, and render ing It possible to carry the shaft to completion. It Is earnestly recommended that such further appropriations be made for the continued prosecution of the work as msy be necessary for the completion of this National Monu ment at an early day. In former messages, Impressed with the Importance ot the subject, I have taken occasion to wuiuwuu w w. gress the adoption of a generous policy towards the District of Columbia. The report ot the Commissioners of the Dibtrtctrherewlth trans mitted, eonulns suggestions and recommenda tions, to all ot which I earnestly Invite your careful atteution. 1 ask your early and favor able consideration of the views which they express as to the Urgent need of legislation for the reclamation of the marshes of the Poto mac and IU Eastern Branch, within the limlta of the city, and for tbe repair ot the streeU of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks, . i. ritwa rfnilrf.d . almost impassar nn hv denav rendered . almost impassa ble and a source of imminent danger to the health of its citizens. The means at the dis posal of the Commissioners are wholly lnade quate for the accomplishment of these impor tant works, and should be supplemented by timely appropriations from the Federal treas ury. The filling of the flaU in front ot the city will add to the adjacent lands and parks now owned by the United SUtes a large and valuable domain, sufficient, it Is thought, to reimburse IU entire cost, and will also, as an incidental result, secure tbe permanent .im provement ot the river for the purposes of navigation. The Constitution having mTesieu wsw with supreme and exclusive Jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, IU citizens must of necessity look to Congress alone for all need-- ib. bo.ta. ba. tamad .jo.

POSTAL IEBVICB I commend this suggestion to the considers tlon of Con urea. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional Circuit -mages. are appomieu, ma expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, of not more than sixty thousand aoiiars jw, which would certainly be small ln comparison with the object to be atuined.
