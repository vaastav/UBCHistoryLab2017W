TRY TO 

CALL FISH OFF. Railroad Interests Fear Consequences of His Injunction Suit. New York, Dec. 9.—Wall street and the railway world are beginning to realize the true import and the true significance of Stuyvesant Fish's at tack upon the legality of the owner ship of Illinois Central stock by the Union Pacific railroad and by the Rail road Securties Company, and, as a result, there is grave apprehension. It has recently developed that power ful influences on "the street" are at work trying to induce or to force Mr. Fish to abandon his injunction suit entirely, because the railroad world and the financiers do not want to see at this time any issue involving a question of public policy tried against the railroads. This does not mean an acknowledgment that the ownership of Illinois Central stock by the two corporations named is illegal or is contrary to public policy. The apprehension which is felt here will be better understood when it is stated that the issue in the Illinois Central case is purely one of public policy and is not based upon nor is it dependent upon any statutory enact ment In the State of Illinois there is no statute prohibiting one corpora tion from holding stock in another. It is asserted by Mr. Fish, however, that there are important decisions to the effect that for one corporation to be permitted to do so is clearly contrary to public policy. The theory regard ing this, it it be true, is that such stock ownership tends to create a monopoly. Wall street has been casting up the accounts upon the hypothesis that Stuyvesant Fish, will win his suit, and the result is staggering. It is stated that even the Illinois Central road would be disrupted, for it has nearly a score of subsidiary compan ies in which it owns stock. The al leged inconsistency of Mr. Fish is said to be shown by the fact htat the Mis souri Pacific, of which he is an in fluential director, owns an enormous block of stock in the Wabash railroad and is controlled by the same interest that owns the Wabash. In fact, there is scarcely a railroad corporation in the United States which does not own stock in another railroad corporation, and the interchange of directors is widespread.

PRESIDENT TO LEGISLATORS DECLARATIONS AND RECOM MENDATIONS OF EXECU TIVE TO CONGRESS. Self-Government for Alaska, Tax on Emergency Currency, Ship Subsidy, Development of Waterways, Investi gation of Industrial Controversies, Some of the Subjects Touched Upon I—Maintains Position As to Control of Corporations—Exhibit for Alaska- Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Washington, Dec. 4. —The annual message of President Roosevelt was read yesterday in both houses of con gress, and practically no business was attempted by either body beyond lis tening to the message. The galler ies of both senate and house were crowded at the beginning of the ses sion of each body, but as the reading progressed the attendance diminished somewhat. In the main, however, it was well maintained until the last sentences of the document had fallen from the lips of the official readers. Senators and members were sup plied with printed copies of the mes sage, and many of them followed the reading clerks with scrupulous care. The reading consumed about two and a quarter hours in each of the houses. The message, in" substance, makes the following suggestions and recom mendations for the consideration of congress: Encouragement to Fair. Giving "liberal encouragement" to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific exposition. "S#me form of local self-govern ment" for Alaska. Giving the governor of Alaska a sufficient appropriation to maintain a peace force. Making the sale of whisky in Alas ka a felony. Encouragement of road building and railway building in Alaska. Establishment of another judicial district in Alaska. Assumption by the federal govern ment of control of the salmon fishing industry. Hoarding of money is to lie con demned, as no nation has sounder fundamental business conditions than this, for, "as a rule," the business of the country is conducted with hon esty and probity. Control of Corporations. Federal control and charter of cor porations; especially control of com mon carriers engaged in interstate commerce. Make the anti-trust law more effi cient and more in harmony with ac tual conditions. Do not prohibit com binations, but control them. Do not tolerate monopolies. Permit reason able agreements between corporations. Grant additional payments to fast ocean steamsttips carrying mails to South America, Asia, the Philippines, and Australia. Build "plenty of torpedo boats and destroyers" and build fortifications of the best type on both the Atlantic and Pacific. Keep the present battle lwt al ways together, but keep it moving from coast to coast. In this connec tion the importance of the Pacific coast is emphasized. "Stands Pat" This Session. It is nuwise to attempt to deal with the tariff question in a year imme diately preceding a national campaign. Repeal the tariff on wood pulp. Op position announced to any tariff on forest products. Relax coastwise shipping laws in fa vor of Hawaii if congress will not encourage shipping faciities between Pacific coast and the island territory. Fortify Hawaii and make Pearl har bor available for the largest deep water vessels. Give attention to instances of abuse in granting injunctions in labor dis putes. Federal inspection of interstate rail roads as a means of preventing acci dents. Extend the federal eighVhour laws. Investigate Industrial Controversies. Compulsory investigation of indus trial controversies. • An income tax and an inheritance tax. Employers' liability act applied to labor in the employ of the federal government as an example to legis latures to enact such laws for the benefit of all labor. A "thorough and comprehensive measure" dealing with the evils of child and female labor applied to the District of Columbia and the terri tories. National system of grading and in specting grain. , Further extension of the irrigation laws. Revision of public land laws. * , Preservation of Forests. More drastic action pi preserve for ests of the country. National forest reserves ard far too small. Government should have the right > hold the fee of coal, oil and gas fields in its own possession and to lease them; but if congress will not provide for this, at least provide for adequate regulations in making sales. Provide for a more elastic currency and an emergency issue to be put out under a heavy tax. Establish postal savings banks and extend parcels most on rural routes. Put fourth-class postmasters under civil service. Army and Navy. Make promotions only by selection instead of seniority. In army, from majors up and in navy from lieuten ant commanders up. Increase medical staff of army. Establish army service corps. Pass Dick-Capron service pay bill. Provide for chief of cavalry as there is a chief of artillery. Give men who have served twelve years in army or navy preference, without examination, over civilians in certain civil service positions. Develop the Waterways. Develop nation's waterways, espe cially the lake to gulf project. Campaign fund evil would vanish if congress appropriated for the expenses of each of the national parties. Appropriate liberally for the Japan ese exposition at Tokyo in 1912. Give president authority to cancel China's debt for indemnity in excess of $11,655,492.89, with interest at 4 per cent. Admit Chinese students. Appropriate-for maintenance of bur eau of American republics. Wants Bureau of Mines. Create bureau of mines in depart ment of the interior. Appropriate to maintain the Her mitage, home of Andrew Jackson. Establish national art gallery in Washington. Appropriate more liberally for the biological survey. Erect naval monument in Vicks burg national park. Strengthen public health service. Provide for the thirteenth census. Upon the conclusion of the reading of the president's message, on motion of Mr. Payne, of New York, it was referred to the committee of the whole and ordered printed. The house ad journed until Thursday next 

ROOSEVELT PLEASES JAPAN. Recommendation in Behalf of Exposi tion Proves That He Is Firm Friend. Tokio, Dec. 9. —Viscount Kaneko has cabled President Roosevelt as fallows: "The whole empire is rejoicing at your strong recommendation that America should participate in our ex position and I thank you on behalf of and with the authority of the people of Japan. (Signed) 

KANEKO." This dispatch is significant as Vis count Kaneko is a member of the privy council. I In an interview with the represent ative of the Associated Press, Vis count Kaneko said: "President Roosevelt is always the firm friend of Japan and he brings out before the world what Japan is whenever the opportunity offers. His message of 1906 eulogized Japan in words which have become a classic with the Japanese people. This year again he has clearly stated the posi tion of Japan, and his message In re lation thereto is commented upon everywhere with appreciation and joy. President Roosevelt's message is re garded as indicative of the true spirit of the American people, depicting the character of the true American, who says what he thinks and does what he says." 

DEMANDS THAT RAILROAD INSTALL BLOCK SYSTEM Olympla, Dec. 7.—The state rail road commission has made complaint against the Northern Pacific and or dered a hearing before itself on Jan uary 20 on an order to compel the railroad to establish a block system or other device for the protection of the tracks between Pullman Junction and Pullman. The commission in its complaint charges that from Pullman Junction the road runs through a rock cut and a very crooked course down grade to the city, so that* train men on incoming trains cannot see whether the main line is occupied at the station. There have been a num ber of collisions there, two of them reported to the commission within the last five weeks. The commission con demns the conditions and cites the road to show why proper safety de vices should not be installed. DEMOCRATS MAY MEET BEFORE REPUBLICANS Washington, Dec. 9.—The Demo cratic national committee will meet at the Arlington in this city next Thursday at noon for the purpose of selecting the place at which and the time when the national Democratic convention shall be held next summer. Col. John I. Martin, of Missouri, the veteran sergeaut-at-arms, is already in the city making preparations for the meeting. Several places, including Chicago, Kansas City, Louisville, Denver and Atlantic City, have been mentioned as candidates for the location and the second of June is now spoken pf as the most probable date of the conven tion. A number of the members of the committee have expressed the opinion that it is desirable that the Demo cratic convention should be held in advance of the Republican, and they generally advocate June 2. ALL SWEDEN MOURNS VENERABLE AND* BELOVED MON ARCH PA3BE3 AWAY SUN DAY MORNING. Crown Prince Takes Oath of Office in Succession to His Father As Gustav V. —Country in Deep Grief Because of Passing of Aged and Adored Sovereign. Stockholm, Dec. 9. —Oscar 11., king of Sweden, died at 9:10 o'clock yes terday morning. The death of the venerable monarch occurred in the royal apartments of the palace, where, surrounded by the members of his family, including the aged queen, Sophia, and the crown prince, Oscar Gustave, and the high ministers of state, the inevitable end had been awaited, while outside the palace great crowds stood with bowed heads and tearful eyes long after the an- nouncement came of the death of their well-loved sovereign. The whole country is bowed with grief, for King Oscar was something more than a ruler of his people, and had endeared himself to them as an intimate and personal friend. When the flag on the palace was dipped to half mast there was a moan of anguish from the as sembled multiude, and many of them cried, "Our dear old king is dead!" The following official bulletin was posted after the king's death: "The strength of the king contin ued to decrease throughout the night and the state of unconsciousness be came more marked. His majesty passed quietly away at 9:10 a. m." New King is Gustav V. The succession to the throne of Sweden now passes to Oscar Gustave Adolphe, Duke of Verland, the eldest son of the late king. At a meeting of the council of state this afternoon the new king took the oath of allegiance under the title of Gustave V., and adopted the motto, "With the people of the fatherland." The princess then took the oath of allegiance, and the new monarch ac cepted the homage of the state offi cials. The last hours of the expiring mon arch were passed in unconsciousness, and up to the end he gave no sign of recognizing those about him. The queen was grief-stricken because he could not bid her farewell. All through Saturday the king had re mained in a comatose condition. At times there were faint signs of con sciousness perceptible as the attend ing physicians brought some tempo rary relief to the sufferer. Their ministrations were without avail and they held out no hope last night beyond a promise to keep the spark of life burning for yet a few hours. The death of King Oscar is not ex pected to be followed by any disturb ances of Sweden's political condition. The venerable monarch has been slowly failing for many months past, and last January he experienced an illness that at the time was expected to end fatally. All precautions have been taken for the orderly passage of power to the hands of his able son and successor, Oscar Gustave Adolphe, Duke of Verland, who will doubtless take the title of King Gustave. FOR ALASKA ROADS. Congress Asked to Appropriate Large Sums for Northern Highways. Washington, D. C, Dec. 10.—Road building in Alaska on a larger scale than ever will be undertaken next year, if the war department is able to in duce congress to make a special ap propriation of $400,000 for the pur pose. An estimate for that amount was submitted to congress yesterday by the acting secretary of war. The letter containing the estimates is very brief, merely saying that this sum is desired for the construction of wagon roads and trails in Alaska, and that the greater part of the amount will be expended on the road from Valdez into the interior and for a road out from Haines Mission. Maj. Richardson, president of the Alaska road commission, is now in Washington, and has been in confer ence with officials of the war depart ment in regard to the proposed appro priation. The only funds available or iginally for the construction of roads and trails in Alaska were those com prised in what is known as the Alas ka fund in the federal treasury, de rived from licenses outside of incor porated towns in the territory. Two years ago this fund was supple mented by a special appropriation of $150,000, and last winter by one of all been expended or obligated, and some valuable work, in road building, has been done under the direction of the road commission. The collections of license money available for road building in Alaska amounted to approximately $100,000 in the last fiscal year. Takahira to Succeed Aoki. Tokyo, Dec. 7. —It has been an nounced here that Baron Kogoro Tak ahira, former minister to the United States, has been chosen to succeed Sinzo Aoki in the Washington em bassy. Baron Takahira is the present ambassador to Italy. Baron Kaneko, foreign special envoy to the United States, and Baron Chinda, vice-minis ter of foreign affairs, were mentioned for the place, but it was decided that they were not so well qualified as Baron Takahira. 

NOVEMBER EXAMINATIONS. Of 893 Applicants for Certificate* **> Were Successful. ' 2 Olympia, Dec. 7.— The work of th November; 1907, teachers' examina tkm is completed, with the follow in results: t w" There were 562 successful annr cants out of 893. Of these, 187 we! raising grades, 67 got certificates on normal diplomas and university din] mas accredited by the state of WaV ington. Nine were renewals of fi m grade certificates, 9 were renewals second grade certificates and 55 were permanent first grade certificates i s sued on the regular certificates upon the applicant's showing evidence O f ninety months' experience, thirty. S j x of which were in the state of : ash ington. The 562 certificates issued are by this time in the hands of the appij. cants. One hundred and forty-four of them were first grade certificates 203 second grade certificates and 215 third grade certificates. One hun dred and twenty-three of the 893 a pi plicants were without teaching ex perience. Of these, 35 were success ful. This does not mean that 35 out of 123 were successful the first time up. Some of these successful inex perienced applicants have been up as many as three times. This is the smallest examination in many years, being little more than one-half the size of the August ex amination. There are various rea sons for this. First, the large issue of permanent first-grade certificates in July last; second, the power of the county superintendent to issue tem porary certificates for a year, and the power of city superintendents in cities of 10,000,t0 do the same, and, last, by far the most important reason, there was a greater percentage of success ful applicants in August than former ly. WARSHIPS ASSEMBLED FOR PACIFIC CRUISE Old Point Comfort, Va., Dec. 10 — The double-starred flag of blue, em blem of the commander in chief of the Pacific-bound battleship fleet, flung to the breeze from the main truck of the battleship Connecticut yesterday, and Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans for mally assumed his position as leader of the greatest naval movement in the history of the American people. This was assembly day for the fleet which is to set sail next Monday, and of the sixteen great fighting machines or dered to skirt the southern end of all America and inaugurate a new naval era in the Pacific ocean, there were but two laggarts. These were the 16,000-ton Minnesota, flagship of Rear Admiral C. M. Thomas, com mander of the second squadron of the fleet, and the Kentucky. The Kentucky is the oldest vessel among the sixteen, having been laid down with her sister, the Kearsarge, In 1898, at the beginning of the war with Spain. Nine years ago is an ancient period in modern battleship construction, so great have been the strides in American naval architec ture. The two long lines of battleships, flanked on either side by vessels of the auxiliary fleet, present a notable picture, and add one more impressing naval event to the history of Vir ginia's far-famed roadstead, where the battle of the Monitor and the Merri mac thrilled the world and set a new standard for future navies to build by. Thousands of sight-seers from all parts of the country are assembled here to witness the final preparations and the departure of the fleet. The families of most of the officers are also among the visitors, and the week is to be crowded with social events of both formal and informal character, the principal function to be a naval and military ball on the evening of Friday, December 13. Admiral Evans arrived this morning from Washington, accompanied by Capt. Ingersoll, his chief of staff, and Lieut. Commander Chandler, his flag secretary. As his flag was broken out from the main truck when he re paired aboard the Connecticut there were the customary salutes from the flagships of the various divisions, and Admirals Emery and Sperry were, soon en route to the flagship to pay their respects. • The commanding officer of the artillery station here, Fort Mon roe, also paid hfs respects to the ad miral.^ Will Test Wireless Telephone. Washington, Dec. 10.—On the way out of Norfolk on their cruise to the Pacific an opportunity was given to the vessels of the torpedo boat de stroyer flotilla to demonstrate the use fulness of the wireless telephone with which they are equipped. Messages subsequently verified were exchanged for more than thirteen miles. All o the sixteen battleships about to sail will 'have wireless telephones. To Cancel Land Patents.
