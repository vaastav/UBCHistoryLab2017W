Ilaaklns, Director, Washing, ton, I). C. President Wilson's annual message to congress, delivered yesterday, is chiefly remarkable for what he did - not say. It is far from being: charac teristic of his previous utterances be fore that body. It contains little to commend it to public interest. The president sets forth plainly the mo tives wnicn impel mm to attena tne ' peace conference. Doubtless they will prove satisfactory to his supporters and will be regarded as Insufficient by his opponents. One- of the sur prises of the president's message is his announcement tbat he has no pro gram, or opinion even on the subject of government ownership of railroads. Be places the entire responsibility for thelrfuture status upon congress. This Is unlike the president to whom we have become accustomed. The presi dent again gives his unqualified ap proval, to woman suffrage, regardless of the tact thatthe Woman's party held the Democrats' responsible for failure of the Susan - B. Anthony amendment to obtain the requisite number of votes. On the whole it was as Inoffensive a message as may be. .. If the traveling public become en- iuuiuiuiliu tLiiu il rvaauiiauie evoiioiiiiea can be effected, says the Atchison Globe, the railroads will hever go back to their owners. But If the service be Indifferent and expensive, popular sentiment will demand that the gov- ernment let go the reins. V President Wilson is being asked to help free Ireland. He has been rend ering assistance In freeing Poland and no sooner was the job finished than the Poles began to murder the Jews. It might be well to find out what the Irish plan to do with their; freedom should they get it. The fact Is that England is ready to give the Irish anything they want If the inhabitants of the Emerald Isle will but agree among themselves regarding their de sires. What they appear to crave more than anything else is freedom to fight among themselves. - If every case of influenea were quarantined as soon as it develops, the victims - could not spread the disease even tho the busiaens houses should remain open. After the adoption of the nerd law in Kansas, farmers . ceased to build fences around their ; crops. Germany still expresses fear of the ' Bolshevik!. No juster fate could be visited upon that country than a reign of Bolshevism for a year or two un less other years were added to the period. - She should have a taste of what she brought upon Russia; be sides she richly deserves it on her own account. If she were left to the undisturbed rule of her Lenlnes and her Trotzkys she would get some measure of what is Justly her due. President Wilson's selection of a peace commission is a reminder of trie old days of political conventions, when the chairman of the resolutions 'committee selected the remaining members. The platform which he carried In his pocket always was adopted by the committee. There is hot a truly big man on the American delegation to the peace conference, unless the president himselfbe ex cepted'. But harmony in that body is - assured from the start. It is reported that Karl Rosner will now tell the truth about the former kaiser; as tho a Hun could tell tne truth about anything. . Congress again is in session and It could perform no greater service to the country than to provide for a bud get system of expending the public money. The necessity for a budget system has multiplied a hundredfold as the expenditures of the government have vaulted upward Into the tens of billions. The burdens of the federal government are now imposed directly unnn mlllinnft nifUaiiui who In t li a, paW th.lr naUonal taxes without knowing it thru tariffs and excises. Now they pay income taxes. They are beginning to think about the way congress disposes, of .their hard earned billions. ',;. . THE : 

PEOPLE MUST DECIDE. Government owners. ilpof railroads which promised to become an issue in the 1920 political campaign, has become a matter of widespread dis cussion in advance of that period as a result of the resignation of Director General McAdoo. Perhaps it is as well that the public had two years in which to make up its mind before be ing called upon, to decide finally. Present indications are that govern ment management under the law will terminate at about the time of the next presidential election unless con gress' shall enact additional legislation on the subject. " Government control of railroads un der the war measure, saysthe Bache Review, has. tended to demonstrate that under one control the railroads of the country may be made to "oper ate with more efficiency, by eliminat ing the wasteful extravagance of du plicated facilities and of unnecessary competition.' While this phase has not yet had time for a complete demon stration, there la no doubt that under expert anj scientific direction, the most perfect accomplishment in trans portation could be realised thru its employment. The argument of those urging government ownership is that this unified control would be made permanent We can imagine, continues the Re view, government, ownership made eminently successful if controlled by business men men of the calibre of some of the two hundred and fifty Sl-a-year men in Washington, who wrested order out of the chaos created by political boards and political ad ministration when we first entered the war, and Who started the . country's great industrial war machine at last into vast and successful accomplish ment. But that was done under emer gency - and" under- pressure from a countrywide public sentiment, which forced change of control. In the de liberate times of peace it is to be feared that no such state of affairs could be brought about a great co ordinated railroad system run for the government by business men, on a business system with politics banished. On the otlfer hand, now that the railroad system of the country has been welded into one great machine, making; each part work, not for its own benefit, but for better results from the whole system, it would be a very difficult and undqubtedly a dan gerous operation to turn back the 'roads to . former control. It would not be so much the physical operation which would be endangered as the financial status of railroad securities. both during the uncertain times of transition as well as afterward in op eratiqn, with wages high, rates again depending upon the interstate com merce commission, and materials pur chased at war prices loaded upon the separated lines. To lift them back bodily into the pool of distress into which the inter state commerce commission had plunged them and kept them im mersed for years would be most dis turbing not only to the holders of their securities, but to the whole busi ness world, because the financial dis asters of railroads create an unfavor able and widespread Influence upon all industry. ( It becomes extremely important, then, to evolve some plan, if possible, which shall combine the benefits of the present method of control with the advantages which private control has in tending to curb political inter ference with its liability to encourage inefficient service. There are two kinds of men, says the Orange Judd Farmer, who run for public office maybe more. One kind asks tb-be elected in order that he may perform certain stunts which he promises to perform if elected. He will guarantee to vote this way or that on some question that folks are wrought vp about and his promises sometimes sound good. The other sort Is the fellow who has real brains and Judgment, who promises very little ex cept to do his best every day and serve his country. He will not go to congress- on a promise to pull wires and obtain any special legislation to benefit farmers, laborers or any other special class of people. He is just an honest man with brains to conceive and 'courage to act that's all. Apparently, Uncle Sam is to lose no time in reaching out after the world trade"-Which is awaiting us. The United States shipping board has defi nitely allocated- 1. 000, 000 tons of shipping to the South American trade, to be effected as soon as withdrawals from their present trade can be made. The ships will operate on regular schedules with but two ports of call for each line one in the United States and the other in a South Ameri can port. This will mean an express service. The war has been over less than a month, but the government already has resumed its building program, as Is witnessed by the following an nouncement: "Sealed proposals will be received at the supervising architect's office, treasury department. Washing ton. D. C, until December 10, 1918. for the construction of the postoffice and court house at Paris, Tex. As might have been confidently expected, the south is first to be benefited by the resumption of construction work. 

EVENING 1 STORY Meddlesome Mattie's Romance. -BY BARBARA KERR. Mattie Mayfleld was the village spinster, and, strange as It may seem, she had in a manner elected or ap pointed herself to that post, tho she did it unwittingly. Her widowed mother died when Mattie was 'in her early teens and Mattie had . to help out her meager Inheritance by some sort of work. She was ambitious to become a teacher, so she let down her dresses, for in those - days the letting down of the dress signified an age of dignity and discretion and Mattie must make an impression on the school board. She put her hair up, very high, practiced her prunes and prisms reli giously before her, mirror till her mouth lost its habit of dimpling and turning itself up at the corners on the slightest provocation and received the school. Some one guessed her age ridiculously old, and, jubilant, she let it remain; then, of course, the mis chief was done. She could not be young if she wished, and at times she did wish, oh, so much! But as tlm went on she almost gave up wishing, took up a staid middle aged life in somber clothes at 28 and that is old in a village and so she became the village "spin." ' She knew also that some people who had felt the Weight of her scorn on occasion had called her Meddlesome Mattie. One evening as she sat' in her 'room before her tiny stove, she said the name to herself, but in a new tone, a determined, respectful tone. "YesJ' she mused, "thifs Ju3t what I shall do. ' I'll be. Meddlesome Mat tie the poor little lamb!" The en dearment had no reference to herself. but to a favorite pupil of hers, Bonnie c:iay Bennington. Poor little Bonnie had done a terrible thing and the gossips were so busy with her name that she could not withstand the venom of it all. She was ill, confined thru the hot summer to her home, while the young husband who had married Jier "clandestinely was at the front, eating his heart out because the rash act, so Bonnie now called it, had wrought so much unhapplness to the one whose happiness was dearer to him than anything else on earth. Of course, it was a dreadful thing in a place where no one else had ever run away and got married. But the fact that Bonnie was being hectored to death by malicious gossip, retailed to her by her disappointed and nagging inother, moved Mattie to angry tears. "I'll not have it! What if she did run away and get married? What If she is a war bride? I wish ' but she did not finish. She laughed and. Jumping, to hereet. did a Highland fling. The unwonted exercise brought the color to viler cheeks and tumbled her hair, till she had to stop and look at herself in the mirror as she scram bled excitedly for pencil and paper. She was going to write a fiction of herilife. She would tell Bonnie and her mother how she had planned to run away with the lover of her youth, but that her courage har failed her and he had gone away never to re turn. She wanted the story to hang together, so she wrote facts first; then made them fit. But she stuck at his name. "Strange," she muttered, "that I cannot recall the name of this man with whom I am running away." She could only think of Lochlnvar.' "I have it Lochiel Ross. I ll call him Lochie!" When Mrs. Clay saw Tner coming she said to Bonnie: "It s that Meddlesome Mattie. You don't want to see her!" But Bonnie answered. "Yes. let her in. She was always n(ce to me, nicer than I deserved." So it happened that Mat tie was soon holding the little wasted hand, and telling with many stops and exclamations alt about her planned elopement, wishing that her eourave had not failed her so that she. would now be happily married. -one Diusned at the .revelation (she was in the habit of telling the, truth) and added many details. It was a changed Bonnie who smiled her a goodby. And Bonnie and her mother talked long over Mattie's sad romance, and when Bonnis wrot to hoe hn,. band she told him the story, adding was so giaa mat sne was net an unhappy old maid, and that he hed married her over all oblections. When he read the letter it was so different in tone from her others that he whistled a merry tune and his DunKle neard him. "Good news. Ben?" he asked wistfully, hoping to hear of the happiness of some home. "You've guessed it, Scotty, and It's all thru the little schoolma'am they used to can Meddlesome Matt." Then he reciteu Mattie s romance to Corporal Thev talked loner and svmnntTiAtirat Iy about the poor little old maid that had lost her nerve and her lover. "I'll Det you, man," observed the corporal, "that she's mighty nearly all right, that little old girl. Let's both write to her. It'll do no harm." - So they did. Mattie, cheered by the vast improve ment in Bonnie, kept up the farce day after day, dropping in with a bit of news, a flower or a poem that re minded her of Lochie, till it- was the seventh wonder of the village that Bonnie Bennington had discharged her doctor and was taking long walks about the country with her old teacher. , Then one day two overseas letters came to Miss Mattie Mayfleld. The one from Bonnie's soldier husband, which she opened first, left her flushed and happy by its ardent thanks. She had made a better soldier of him, he said: had relieved his mind and from now on she was to consider him as her soldier, too. The other she read thri twice. Scotty was telling her how she was the most wonderful woman, that his mother would have done Just such a beautiful thing In her place, and so on. , "Why. he thinks I'm as old as Me thuselah!" she exclaimed Indignantly. Then she lauajhed a little ruefully it .might liave been a real romance if. "Well, I'll tell him the truth" she said and she did, but told him as he valued Bonnie's health not to tell Ben. But time is long in the trenches. The con fession was too funny to keep, and Scotty had to tell Ben. "But. Ben." he said: "that makes her better than ever. She risked a lot of gossip making out that she had been giddy, when evidently she's never had time to do anything but make her liv ing. Wouldn't it get you?" But Ben. with tears in his eyes, was realizing the need that Mattie had felt that something heroic must be done to save his wife, and Mattie's stock soar ed to the skies. wnen mattie wrote she naa told ner ace. Corporal Scott was just turning 32. When ehe confessed the corres pondence to Bonnie they laughed and giggled like two romantic schoolenrls. Of course love can come "sight un seen." as Ihe boys say when they swap jack knives, for letters often disclose real hearts. So Ben was chaperon to the romance which culminated when he and Scotty were allowed to come home on sick leave, - And Scotty heed ed no second invitation to spend his leave with Ben. There were two very happy couples indeed that made w foursome in th walks and drives about the village. Corporal Scott tried to convince Mattie that it .would now be in order for them to eldpe, for he was ready to wind up the romance in true Lochln var style. "Whose romance is this, I'd like to know?"- growled Ben. "Bon- hie and I did enough sToping for all of us, and we've earned the right to 'stand up with you rignt regular. And so it was that Meddlesoma'Mat tle ceased being meddlesome at the same instant that she ceased being the village "spin" and became the wife of Corporal Scott.

EASK1N, Director. Washington, D. C. PCT XOlIR tOWX OS AIR ROUTE. Washington. D.. C. Nov. SO. The flights which are now being made al most, dairy from every American avia tion field, for the purpose of making air-maps and gathering air statistics, mark the beginning of a great peace time development of flying. in this development the United States government asks the co-opera-tlont of every American city and town of any commercial importance. For it expects wltmn tne next lew years to have a well-equipped landing field in every such town, and two or three hundred landlne fields are urgently and Immediately needed. The towns which establish them will naturally train nrestlee as pioneers in the devel onment of this industry of the future. And it will not be long before a land ing, field will be almost as Indispen sable, to an up-fodate town as a rail road station, in the opinion 01 tne gov- Arnment airmen. - A landing: field must be level, fres from obstructions, and about the size of the ellipse enclosed by a mile race track. - It must be provided with a shed. ODen at one end, and there should be a caretaker, and ga3 and oil supplies near at hand The equipment of such a field need not cost more than $1500. and waste lana can gen erally be used, - The permanent plan for maintain ing such landing fields has not yet beeh determined upon; but the pres ent plan is for live municipal organl zatlons to co-operate with the govern ment. Chambers of commerce. Ro tary clubs and like civic bodies are requested to come rorwara w;in oners of assistance to obtain tha use of suitable fields and raise the funds wherewith to equip and maintain them. Any such organisation which wishes to co-operate with the govern ment in- this undertaking-should ad dress the director of military aeronau tics, training section. navigation branch, Washington, D. C. It is a fact not generally recognized that the government now has in its hands the legal powers, the men and the machines to promate a great de velopment of the airplane as a means of travel and communication. Now that the war is over, and planes and flyers are coming home, it is to just such a development that the division of.Jnilitary aeronautics is devoting its energies. The present government control of flying is of course a war measure. Congress will doubtless be called upon to pass some legislation providing for the development of fly ing in time of peace. At present, however, the govern ment has absolute conjyol both of the manufacture and of the flying of air planes. Furthermore, the army has now In this country 32,000 combat planes and 5, BOO training planes. Be sides these there are thousands of American planes in Europe, and the United States will get a share of the Oerman planes. This does not include the planes attached to the navy and to the marine corps. sIn the way 'of personnel, there are 8,538 reserve military aviators trained in thbj-.pountryj and 2,835 cadet flyers Fiowjip t$i6dg. The total number ot those who have - been admitted to schools Is 22,500. ' Up to October 9, 1.&.08 aviators had been trained broad. The army alono has about '15,000 air plane mechanics. i This aggregation of men and equip ment.; combined with the broad-powers which the government has over the use and manufacture -of planes, af fords perhaps the greatest opportunity for a unified development of flying on a peace basis that has ever existed. European nations of course, also have flyers and machies; but they are ex hausted, both as to finance and as to manpower." The United States, there fore, is in a position to lead the world in the development of the airplane in dustry. This establishment of air routes, and landing fields, which is the purpose of the present series of cross country flights, is the most immediate and pressing need. It will go further than anything else to make flying safe, ac cording to the army aero-experts. At present a flyer in the air is com parable to a Dioneer nlune-ine- into an unexplored country with a cdmpass ana an idea where he wants to go, but without a map or a trail. He is still more like a mariner sailing a sea which has never been charted, and without any knowledge of where he could make port in case of a storm. Travel In the air, like travel on earth and on water, must have recog nized routes and stopping places be fore it can be made safe. The birds have instinctively recognized this fact, and in their migrations always follow the same general lines of travel and stop at the same places. i The airplane has alreadv become a stable and dependable machine. It Is no more liable to mechanical trouble than the automobile, and is in much less danger of collision. The risk in flying comes chiefly from two sources. In the first place, unexnected chanaes of weather may cause disaster, and in the second place, if the aviator has to land on account of engine or other me chanical trouole, and has no good place to land, he is up against it. The knowledge of meteorolocr, which will enable the airman to avoid storms and unfavorable atmospheric conditions, ie a matter of scientific re search which will take years, and which is now being carried on by our weather bureau and by our military flyers. It will be srreatly sided and systematized t.y the establishment of recognized routes of air travel. , The provision of abundant landing fields, properly equipped, will consti tute a factor of safety in flying which will make the airplane no more dan gerous as a means ot cross country travel than the automobile. When nn , aviator has mechanical trouble- ' or i meets with dangerous conditions no-? ! his only expedient is to select the most inuia-'ic mi'uihe ,)ivi uc Lull per omu ; descend. He may have the good for- j tune to reach an open field; but it Is Just as likely that be Vill have to land ' in a forest or on a steep mountainside! Then, too, there is always the menace t of telephone or teleirraphv wires, which i are Invisible Trom above. A large per- centage of all the accidents in aviation are landing accidents. -i For these reasons. American cities, by co-operating with the government in the establishment of landing fields. Can give a great impetus to the devel opment of aviation in this country. Tm surprised that you welcome me so warmly," said the seedy visitor. "Why?" asked the editor.

DOROTHY DIX TALKS BY DOROTHY DIX World's Highest Paid Woman Writer. Should a Married Woman Work Out side of the Home? 2. Every good wife desires above all else to help her husband, but she doesn't see why shs can't help him in the way that is easiest and most agree able to herself. Why shouldn't she do her own work in her own way, and with the money she makes hire some domestic woman to run her home for her. It Would make for comfort and efficiency all around. ! . Certainly the. additional advantages the mother would be able to give the children in environment, food, clothes and education by reason of her earn ings being added to the family ex chequer would far more than offset any disadvantage that there might possibly ba in her not being perpetu ally with her children. But the chief reason for women con tinuing after marriage in whatever oc cupation they were following beforo marriage is to be found in the fact that it '-makes marriage possible be tween men and women at the mating time of life at the time when they can best adjust themselves ( to each other, and to the matrimonial yoke, and when they can give the best chil dren to the world. Under present economic conditions the average poor young man cannot support a family in decent comfort by his own unaided efforts. If he mar ries & girl who adds nothing to the family budget except expense he drags her down to abject poverty. If he waits until he is earning enough to safely make the matrimonial venture he is middle aged, he has grown self ish and doesn't want to marry. The fire of his young love Is gone. i That is why there are" fewer and fewer, marriages every year, and why the old maid crop grows bigger and bigger. Men simply can't afford the luxury of a dependent wife, but they could marry and would like to marry, if they could get wives who would be assets instead of liabilities. If every wife had her own pay envelope, earned by her own hands, instead of badger ing her husband out of his senses for the contents of hls it would, not only make matrimony possible but would make it popular. - It would make marriage a partner ship in which husband and wife- con tributed to the prosperity of the firm, and shared in the upkeep of the home. It would give women their coveted boon of financial independence, and the husband would find the wife who had been out In 'the world all day see ing and doing Interesting things a far more entertaining companion, and a morexcheerful one than is the woman who nas moped in the house all day, and gotten dull and stupid doing a monotonous round ef household task a Of course, when a man, la rich and chooses to indulge himself; in-the lux ury of keeping his wife sitting on a silk cushion and sewing up a seam and feeding on strawberries and cream, that's another story. But it's a differ ent story for the poor man. and he need feel no shame, only pride in a wife who can be a helpmeet with mak ing money instead of scrimping and saving it- !
