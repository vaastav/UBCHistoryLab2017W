Hut our our- . rency system Is imp. -rfoct, aril it is ear- nestly to lie lupo) that the eiirrency j commission will be- able to propose a thoroughly Rood system which will do away with the existing defects. Purine the period from July 1, iScl. to September .V". there was an in. rease In the amount of money in (-in illation of ti-oI.Kd.rsiS. The im rease in the per capita during thin p. r ,o.l was 7.0S. Within this time there wore several occasions when it was necessary for the treasury de partment to ecme to the relief of the money market hy purchases or redemp tion of Pniteel State bonis: ly increas ing deposits tn national bunks: by stim ulating additional Issues of national hank notes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold.

It is well to keep In mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the reaction ary the worst enemy .if older, so the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrong dorrs of great wealth. a-i the men who are champlon'ng popular rights have most to fear from the di -pin segue who in the name of popular r;t-iits would do wrong to and oppress 1. tiest business men, honest men of weal; h: for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily In vites a violent react-on against the cause the wrongdoer nmnally upholds. . . . Need of Centralization. The proposal to make the na tional government supreme over, and therefore to Rive it complete control over, the railroads and other Instruments of Interstate commerce is merely a propos al to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes. If not tlie prime purpose, for which the -constitution was founded. It does not ivpres.-nl centralization. It represents merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralization has already come in business. If this irre sponsible outside business power Is to be controlled In the interest of tlie general public it can on'y be controlled In one way; by pivlns adeo a;c p.iwr of con trol to the one soverelcnty capable of ex ercisine such power the national govern ment. To abandon the effort for national control means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render like ly cnntlnti.il bursts of action hy state leg islatures, which cannot acl 'eve the pur pose seuyj.t for. but which can do a preat deal of damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on the public. There should be t emulation by the na tional Rnvcrnn-ier.t cf t' e treat Interstate corporations, inrlud'ng a simple method cf account keej'!):;. p!; licit y. supervision of the issue of so urities. aKdition of rebates and of special privileees. There should be short-time franchises for ail corporat'ons ena z d in public business: lnfludins the corp 'rations which pet power from water rights. There should be national as well as state guardianship of mines and forests. The labor legisla tion hereinafter ref rr d to should con currently !w enacted irttn law. To accomplish th's. means a certain In crease In tie- use i f-not the creation of power, by the c- n'ril c . rntnent. The power already ex'sts: it does not have to be created: the only question Is whether It s'a-il! be used or left idle and meanwhile the corporations over which the pow.r oupht to be exercised will not remain Idle. Tl e daa-er to Amer ican democracy lies not in the least in tlie concentration cf administrative power In responsible and :u a ountabb- lauds. It lies in l-. i i titi the- p mo r Insulflciently concent ratt d. so that no one can be held responsible to the people for its use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily reached, quickly held to account. lienioetacy is in peril wherever the administration of po litical power is scattered amnne a variety of men who work in secret, whose very names are un known to the common p-ople. It is not in peril from any man who derives au thority from the people, who exercises it In sight of the people, and who is from t.n.e to time compelled, to Rive an account of Its exercise tn the people.

In thla respect tha generosity of the United States towards Its employes compares most unfavora bly with that of every country In Eu rope even the poorest j I renew my recommendation made In 1 a previous message that half-holidays be granted during summer to all wage workers in government employ . I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as practi cable be extended to the entire work being carried on by the government; the prisent law should be amended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present wording of the act seems to exclude. Would Double Salaries of Judges. I most earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of increasing the totally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole there Is no body of publit se rvants who do as valuable work, nor whose moneyed reward is so Inadequate compared to their work. Be ginning with the supreme court the judges should have their salaries dou bled. It is not befitting the dignity of the nation that its most honored public servants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn In private life that the performance of public service by them implies an ex ceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice. It Is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration of Justice, nnd which operate with peculiar sever ity against persons of small means, and faver only the very criminals whom It Is most desirable t punish. These long delays in the final decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil: and a remedy shouii be devised. Much of this intolerable delay Is due to improper regard paid to technicali ties which are a mere hlnderance to justice. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has re sulted in a striking denial of Justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic. Labor Leaders Criticised. At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent nnd sweeping attack upon the entire judi ciary of the' country, an attack couched In such terms as to Include the most upright, honest and broad-minded Judges, no less than those of narrower mind and more restricted outlook. Last year, before the house com mittee on Judiciary, these same labor leaders formulated their de mands, specifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compro m'se. stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They insisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no Injunction should Issue except to protect a property right, and specifical ly provided that the right to carry on business should not be construed as a property right; and In a second provis ion their bill made legal in a labor dis pute any act or agreement by or be tween two or more persons that would not have been unlawful if done by a single person. In other words, this bill legalized blacklisting and boycotting In every form, legalizing, for Instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike com mission so unreservedly condemned; while the right to carry on a business was explicitly taken out from under that protection which the law throws over property. The demand was made that there should be trial by Jury in contempt cases, thereby most seriously Impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented a course of policy which. If carried out. would mean the enthronement of class privilege in Its crudest nnd most brutal form, and the destruction of one of the most essen tial functions of the Judiicary In all civ ilized lands. The violence of the crusafle for this legislation, and its complete failure, illustrate two truths which It Is essen tial our people should learn. In the first place, they ought to teach the workingman, the laborer, the wage worker, that by demanding what Is Im proper and Impossible he plays into the hands- of his foes. Such a crude and vicious attack upon the courts, even if it were temporarily successful, would Inevitably In the end cause a violent reaction and would band the great mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all the Judges, competent and Incompetent alike, rather than to see tlie wheels of Justice stopped. The waeeworkers. the worklngmrn, the laboring men of th" country by the way in which they repudiated the ef fort to g-t them to cast their votes In response to on appeal to class hatred, have emphasized their sound patriotism and Americanism. Such an atfitude is an e liject lesson in good citizenship to the entire nattem. Judicial System Sound. Our judii ial system Is sound and eff'itive at (ore-, and It remains, and must ever l-e maintained, as ii e safeguard eif those principles of lib erty nnd justice whieh stand at the foundation e,f American Institutions; for. as Iturke finely said, when liberty and justice- are separated, neither Is safe. Then- are. however, some members of the- Judicial body who have lagged be hind in their un icrstatuling of these gre at and vital e hanttes in tlie body politic, whose minds have neviT been (.pencil te tlie new applications of tlie old prim iples made necessary by the new e-emdi tions. Judges of this stamp do last ing harm by their de-risl ins, because they convince poor men in need -of protection that tlie ceiurts eif the land are pro foundly IgiU'rant of and nut of sympathy with their needs, aad profoundly ignorant or hos'ile to any proposed remedy. To such men it se-ems a cruel moe ke-ry to have any eourt eb ide against the m on the ground that H desires to preserve liberty" In a purely techni'-al form, by withholding liberty in any real and con structive Ke-r'e There are.- certain dee-isleins by various renins which have bee n exceeding! y det rimental to the rights of wage-w 'rkers. This is true of nil decisions that decide that nun are. bv the constitution, "guar-ant-e-d their liberty" tei" conti act to enter a dangerous oe-ei:patein. or to work an 1 undesirable or Improiwr number of hours, ; or to work In unhealthy surroundings; i and therefore cannot roe-over damages ; wl en maim' d In that occupation, and I '-annul le forbidden to work what the : leg shit tire i!es Ides Is nn ex'-essive num ; her e,f hours, or to carry on the work ' under remditlors which tho legislature ; dcidi-s to be unhealthy. Ieclsieins such as tho" nullify the legislative effort to protect tlie wage-workers who most need protect inn from those employ er who take advantage of their grind ing need. Tliey hall or hamper the move m nt for se uring better and more equi table conditions eif l.itieir. There Is also. I think, ground for the belief that substantial Injustice. often suffered by employes In ronsequence of the custom of courts Issuing temporary Injunctions without notice to them, and punishing them feir contempt of court In instances where, ns a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of any proceed ings Organ'tte-d labor is rhaflng under the unjust re-stralnt whirh ceitu- fr- m te n ''ed reseirt to this f'.un of plea e-dure. Its discontent ha been unwise ly expressed, and often Improperly rpre-sse-d. but there I a sound basis for It. and the or di rly and I iw-ab-idin ; people of a com munity would lee- In a far stronger posi tion fer upholding the court if the un doubtedly existing abuse could be pro viced a pal nst. Injunction Must Remain. The powe r of iiioiiie lion is a great equitable remedy, whb h should on no account te destroyed, liut safeguards should be erected against Its abuse. 1 In substance, provision should be made that no injunction or temporary re straining order Issue otherwise than on notice, except where irreparable Injury would otherwise result: nnd In such case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a short fixed pe riod, and. If not then continued after hearing, it should forthwith lapse. De cisions should be rendered Immediately, and tho chance of delay minimized In every way. Moreover, I believe that the procedure should be sharply defined, and the Judge required minutely to state the particulars both of his nctlon and of his reasons therefor, so that the congress can If It desires examine and Investigate the same. For many of the shortcomings of Justice in our country our people ns a whole are themselves to blame, and the Judges and Juries merely bear their share together with the public as a whole. It Is discreditable to us as a people that there should be dilllculty in convicting murderers, or In bringing to Justice men who ns public servants have been guilty of corruption, or who have protlted by the corruption of public servants. The result Is equally unfortunate, whether due to hairsplit ting technicalities In the Interpretation of law by Judges, to sentimentality and class consciousness on the part of Juries, or to hysteria nnd sensational Ism In the dally press. For much of this failure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such. YV who make up the mass of the people cannot shift the responsibility from our own shoulders. Put there Is an impor tant part of the failure w.ach has spe cially to do with inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave badly. The Modern Corporation. The huge wealth that has been accu mulated by a few individuals of recent years, In what has amounted to a so cial and industrial revolution, has been ns regards some of these individuals made possible only by the improper use of the modern corporation. A certain type of modern corporation, with its officers nnd ngents. Its many Issues of securities, and Its constant consolida tion with allied undertakings, finally becomea nn instrument so complex as to contain a greater number of ele ments that, under various Judicial de cisions, lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved in the human brain. Corporations nre necessary instruments of modern busi ness. They have been permitted to become a menace largely because the governmental representatives of the people have worked slowly In provid ing for adequate control over them. Our great clusters of corpora tions, huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multimillionaires, employ the verv best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws In statutes after their passage: hut they also employ a class of secret agents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostile legisla.ion Innocuous by making It un constitutional, often through the inser tion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provisions against the interests of the parties Inspiring them: while the demagogues, the cor rupt creature3 who introduce black mailing schemes to -strike" corpora tions, and all who demand extreme, and undesirably radical. measures, show themselves to be the worst ene mies of the very public whose loud mouthed champions they proftsu to be Real elatnavre has been done by the manifold and conflicting Interpretations oi the int'-rstatc commerce law. Con trol over the great corporations doing interstate business can be effective only If it is vested with fu.l po-.ver In nn administrative ib-partnunt. a branch of the federal executive, carrying out a federal law; it can never be effective if a divided responsibility is b ft i t both the stnt.s nnd the nation; it can never be effective if left in tic hands of the courts to he decided by lawsuits. Respect for Law Must Be Upheld. The courts hold n phu e of peculiar and deserved sanctity unde r our form of gov ernment. Kespert for the law is essen tial to the permanence nf our institu tions: and respect for the law Is largely conditioned up.ui r'-spect for the courts. It Is an offense against the republic to say anything which can weaken this re spect, save for the gravest reason and in the most carefully guarded manner. In nu other nation In tlie world do the courts wl.-id such vast and far-reaching power as In the I'nited States. All that Is nec essary Is that the courts as a whole should ejrcise tills power with the far sighted wisdom already shown by those Judges who scan tlie future while they act in the present. Pet them exercise tills great power not only honestly anJ bravely, hut with wise insight into tlie needs and fixed purposes of the people, so that they may do Justice, and work equity, so that tin y may protect all per sons In their rights, nnd ye-t break down the barriers of privilege, which Is the foe of right. Forest Preservation. If there Is nny one duty which more than another we owe P 'o our children fo perr.,im at once. It Is to save the fur eft, eif this country, for they constitute the first and most important element In tin- conservation of the natural ret-soure-e-B of the country. . . . Just as a farmer, after all his life making his living from his farm, will, if In- Is an ex pert farmer, leave It ns an asse t of in e n ased value to his son. so we should have our naUonnl domain to our chil dren, Increased in value and not worn out. There nre small sections of our own country, in th" east and In the wast, In the Adirondack, the White mountains and the Appalachians, and In the Hooky mountains, w Ik re we can already see .'or ourselves the elamage In the shape ,,f permanent Injury to the se.il and the river systems which comes freim reckless deforestation. It matters not whether this deforestation Is due to the artual reckless rutting of timber, to the fires that inevitably follow such reckless cut ting of timber, or to re-ekless and uncon trolled grazing, especially by the great migratory bands of sheep, the un checked wandering eif which over the country means destruction to forests and disaster to the small home-make-rs, the settlers of limited means Thanks to euir own recklessness In the use of emr splendid forests, we have nlrenly crossed the verge of a timber famine In this country, and no measures that we now take ran, al least for mnny years, unrb) the mischief that has already be-e-n done. Put we can pre vent further mise hief be ing done; and H would tn- in the highest degree reprehen sible to let any consideration of tem porary ronvenlenee or temporary cost Interfere with such action, especially as regards the national forests wMoh the nation can now, at this very moment, control. The lesson of deforestation in China Is a lesson which mankind should have learned many times already from what has occurree; n other places. Iienuda tlon leaves naked soil; then gullying cuts down to the bare roe k; nnd mean while the rock-waste buries the bottom land. When tlie eil is gone, men must go; and the process dors not take long. Plea for Inland Waterways. Action should be begun forthwith, dur ing the present session of the congress, for the Improvement of our Inland water waysaction which will re-sult In giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. I'ntil the work of river Improvement Is undertaken In a modern nay It ran not Pave results that will meet the ni.-eds of tills niodern nation. The plan iliich promises the bes and uuick- per- est results Is thnt of mancnt commission ii inr zrn n cu-ur" dlnate the work of nil the government departments relating to waterways, und to frame and supi rvlse the execution of a comprehensive plan. I'nder such a commission the actual work of construc tion might be entrusted to the re Luna tion service; or to the military engineers acting with a sufllcicnt number of civili ans to continue the work In time of war; or It might be divided between the rec lamation service and the corps of en gineers. Funds should be provided from mrrent revenues if It Is deemed wise therwlse from the sale of bonds. The jssentinl thing Is that the work should go forward under the best possible plan, and with the least possible delay. The time for playing with our waterways Is past. Tho country demands results. The president urges that national parks adjacent to national forests be placed under the control of tho forest service of the agricultural depart ment; he also points out the benefits derived from pure food legislation. The message continues: Needs of the Secret Service. Last year nn amendment was Incor porated In the measure providing for tho secret service, which provided that there should be no detail from the secret serv ice and no transfer therefrom. The amendment In question was of benefit to no one excepting to criminals, and It seriously hampers the government In the detection of crime nnd the se-curlng of Justice. The chief argument In favor of the provision was that the congressmen dhl not them selves wish to be Investigated by the secret servle-c men. Very little of such Investigation has been done In the past; but It Is true that the work of the secret service ngents wns partly responsible for the Indictment nnd conviction of a sen ator and a congrersman for land frauds In Oregon. I do not believe that It is In the public Interest to protect criminals In nny branch of the public scrvh-e, and exactiy as we have again and again dur ing the past seven years prosecuted and convicted such criminals who were In the executive branch of the government, so In my belief we should be given ample means to prosecute them if found in the legislative branch. Put If this Is not considered desirable a special exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of the secret service force In Inves tigating members of the congress. Postal Savings Banks. I again renew my recommendation for postal savings banks, for deposit ing savings with the security of the government behind them. The object is to encourage thrift nnd economy in the wage-earner and person of mod erate means. It Is believed that in the nggre g.-ite vast sums of money would be brought into llrcuhition through the in strumentality of the postal savings banks. Parcel Post. In my last annual message I com mended' the postmaster-general's recommendation for an extension of th" parcel post on the rural routes. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to tne mutual benefit of the farmer and the country store keeper, and it is dcstrablo that the routes, serving more than l.i.t")ti.(ic people, should be Utilized to the fullest practii-able extent. Education. With the limited means hitherto pro viib d. the bureau of education has renibrid efficient service, but the emi gre --s has neglected to adequately sun ply the bureau with means to meet tlie educational growth of the country. I carneatly recommend that this U'l fortunate state of affairs as regards the national educational otlice be renie -die-d by adequate appropriations. This recommendation is urged by the repre stntotives of emr common schools and ureal state universities and the ica.lin : educators, who all unite In requesting favorable consideration nnd action by the congress upon this subject. The ir sid.'tit points ml', the neces Mty cf l.et-t If r tii-?ai.izatlon of the vari ous bureaus responsible for the public health, and urges the plad' t; of all soldio-s' homes ti lid t the jurisiliclh'U of thf war !' part mt nt. Statehood, the qiitstion -of statehood the On president says: I ;tdvo'ate the immediate admission of New Mexl'-o and Arizona as stab s. This should In- done- at the present sesaion of the congress. The people of the two ter ritories have maile it evident by tin ir votes that they will nut come in as one state. The only alti rnalive Is to admit them ns two. and I trust that this will be done without eb-hiv. Interstate Fisheries. I call the attention of the congress to the importance eif the problem of the fisheries in the Interstate waters. On the Cn-at Iikes we are now, under the very wise- treaty of April II of this year, en ilenvoring lo come to nn International agreement for the preservation and sat isfactorv use of the fisheries of these wa ters which can riot otherwise be achieved. Pake Krie, for example has the richest fresh water fisheries I'. the world: but it Is now controlle I by the statutes of two nations, four L-..ites. and one province-, and this province by two different ordi nances In different reunifies. All those political ''Ivislons work nt cross pur poses and in no case can they achieve protection to the fiaherie-s, on the one hand, and Justice lo the localities and in dividuals on the other. Foreirn Affairs. This nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that ri-thl must be done between nations precisely as between Individuals, and In our actions for tho last ten years we have in this matter proven our faith by our eb-eds. We have behaved, and are- hehavln-r. to wards other nations, ns In private life an honeiiahle man would behave to wards his fellows. Latin-American Republics. The commercial nnd material prog ress of the 20 I,atin-Amer!can republics Is worthy of the careful attention of the ceingress. The International linreaii eif the American He publics Is doing a useful weirk In making these nations and their resources belter known to us. and in ncqiia 'ntlng them not only with us n a peo-e nnd with our pur poses towards the m, but with what we have to exchange for their goods. Panama Canal. The work on the Pnnnma canal Is be ing done with a speed, tlie-leney and entire devotion to duty, which make It a moded for all work of the kind. The men en the Isthmus, from Col. Coethals anil his fellow commissioners through the entire list of employes who are faithfully doing their duty, have won their right to the ungrudging respect und gratitude of the American people. Ocean Mail Lines. I again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1S91 so that satis, factory American ocean mall lines to (South America. Asia, the Philippines, and Australasia may be established. Hawaii. I call particular attention to the Ter ritory of Hawaii. The Importance of those islands is apparent, and the need of Improving their condition and de veloping their resource Is urgent. The Philippines. Heal progre toward self-government is being made In the Philippine istunds. I trust that within a generation the time will arrive when the l'hlllpplne-s can decide for themselves whether tl U well for them to become Independent, or iu t-uiumtixi ... v. . .. a imMAt no iiniici. i iv.ni v able to msnT nrtil 1141111 (TPS ltd lH'ri, gunrnnlee to the Islands order nt homo and protection from foreign Invasion. Porto Rico. I again recommend thnt American cit izenship bo conferred upon the people Of Porto Hieo. Cuba. In Cubn our occupancy will censn In about two months' time; tho Cubans have In ordeTly manner elected their own governmental authorities, nnd the Island will be turned over to them. Our occu pation on this occasion hns lasted a lit tle over two years, nnd Cuba has thriv en and prospered under It. Our earnest hope and one desire Is that the peopla of the Island shnll now govern them selves with Justice, so thnt peace and or der may bo secure. Japanese Exposition. The Japanese government hns post poned until 1917 the dnte of the great international exposition, tho action be ing taken so ns to insure ample time in which to prepare to ninko the expo sition nil that it should bo mnde. The American commissioners have visited Japan and the postponement will mere ly give ampler opportunity for Ameri ca to be represented at tho exposition. Not since the first International expo sition hns there been one of greater Importance than this will be, marking, ns it docs, the fiftieth nnnlversary of the ascension to the throne of tho em peror of Japan. The extraordinary bap to the foremost place among tho nations of the world made by Japan during this half century Is something unparalleled in all previous history. I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way in which In Japan, in Australia, In New Ken hi ml. and In nil the states of South America, the battle fleet has been re ceived on Its practice voyage around the world. The American government can not too strongly express its appre ciation of the abounding and generous hospitality shown our ships in every port they visited. The Army. As regards the army I call attention to the fact thnt while our junior olll cers and enli.-ted men stand very high, the present system of promotion by seniority results in bringing Into the higher graibs many men of rncdiocro capacity who have but n short time to serve. No man should regard it ns his vested right to rise to the highest rank In tin- army nny more than In any other profession. It is a curious nnd by no means creditable fad that there should be so often a failure on tho part of the public nnd its representa tives to understand the great need, from the standpoint of the service nnd the nation, of re-fusing to promote re spectable, elderly inoompe tents. The higher places should be given to the most ib serving nu n without regard to seniority; at bast seniority should ho treated as only one con-oderation. In the stress of modern Industrial com petition no business tirm could succeed If those responsible for Its management were chosen simply em the ground that tin y wo re the obb st people In its em ployment; yet this Is the course advo cated as regards the army, and re quired by law for all grades except those of ua-neral officer. As a matter of fact all of the best olli.-i rs In the highest ranks of tlie army are those who have attained their present posi tion wholly or in part by n process of sole ct Ion. Tlie scope of retiring hoards slpauld be rxtemb d so that they could con sider general unfitness to command for any cause, in ordi r to secure a far metre rigid e nforce incut than at present In the- elimination of oil rs for mental, physical or tempi raniental disabilities. Put this plan is r. coinini nded only if the eongT' ss does not s e tit to provide what in m Judg iii. nl la far better, that is. for selection in promotion, and for elimination for ace. u'ici rs who fail to attain a certain rank by a cer tain age. should be retired -for In ttance. if a man should not attain held rank by the time he Is 4.'i ho should of course be placed on the re tired list. !!! ral oMici-rs should be selected as at pr.-otit. and one-third of the other promotions should bo made by si lection, tin- selection to be made by tin- provident or sicrctary of war from a list of at least two catidl- iti priiposi 1 for each vacancy by a rs from the arm of tho which the promotion is A bill is now hi fore t ho board e.f ott.c service from to be made contrri s cure tin having for ita object to se t.roniotioii of oil'ci rs to varl- one grades at a pr ss of s fic.TS. of the merit with a ib pending tit" reasonable ag..s thrnuah . b ctioti. by boards of of b nst etlieient for retire- percentage of their pay n length of service. Tho hill, although not that should He done. ccomplishing all is a long stop In the right direction; receitiimeiiil ils pissta: and I earnestly e. or that of a more completely effci live measure. National Guard. Now that the organized militia, the Nati'.o.tl ijuard. has been Incorporated witli tlie army as a part oi the national forns. it In ho.iv s tin- gove rnment to do every reasonable tiling In Its power to perfect its eHicleticy, It should bo assisted in its instruction and olio r wise aided more lib. rally than heretofore-. The e-otit iniious services of many we-ll-t rained regular fiihcers will be essential in this eonm -etion. A bill is now pending before the congress creating a number of extra office rs in the army, w hich if passed, as it ought tei I.e. will enable more ollicers to be trained (is instructors of National Cuard and assigned to that duty. In case of war it will be of tho utmost importa ma- to have a largo number of train, d o lieers to use for turning raw levies into good troops. The Navy. I the crea approve tin: recommendations of general- board for the in- ise of the I: ivy, calling espee-ial Ml. ill to the ncid of addi ntte tional destroyers and colliers, and above nil. of the four battleships. It Is eb-slr-nble to compb te as soon ns possible a squiidroii of eight battleships of tlie best e xisting type. I most i-ariicitly recommend that the genei-.-il board be by law turned Into a general staff. There Is literally no ex cuse whatever for .ontinuitig the pres ent bureau organization of the navy. Tho navy should l o trcal"i as a purely mili tary organization, and everything should be snbordlnati el to the one object of se curing military e-lliciency. ' A system of promotion by merit, either by selec tion or by exclusion, or by both proee'Hses. should be- Introduced. It is out of the qui-stiem. If the pre-se-nt principle of promotion by mere seniority is kept, to expei t to get the best results from the higher olllce rs. Our men come too old, ami stay for too short a time, In the high command positions. Nothing better for the navy from every standpoint has ever ore-urred than the rruise of the buttle licet around the world. The Improvement of tho ships In every way has liee-n extraordinary, and they have gained fnr more experience in battle tae-tle-s than they would have gained If they had stayed In the Atlantic waters. The American people have cause for profound gratification, both In view of the excellent condition of the fleet as shown by this cruise, and in view of the Improvement the cruise has worked In this alre-ady high condition. I do not believe that there is any other service in tlie world In which the average of char acter and efficiency In the enlisted men is as high as is now the case In our own. THKODOHIi POOSKVEl,T..
