At a lecturer, he it one ef that class who stand between the pulpit aad the people aad express that religions truth which it sombre and formal from the minister, bat which Is genial and popular from the lecturer. He doet not state hit thought! in the formal method of a writer on Logic, but la the way which takes hold of tbe heart We ean do nothing but give aa oatline of hit thought without mak ing any attempt to dress it ia hit owa words. Too little faith It put la the people. Politi cians and the Press bandy oerain compliments to them but yet distrust the instincts of the num. . The wisdom of the people it teen fully illustrated la aa old New England town, when none but the minister and phy sician an educated, but where all things are directed in simple honesty. A man's life it when hit heart Is, la hit Lome. Home it the center around whloh he revolves. Tbe nations life begins in its home, and ultimate ly the love of country it but the love of heme. This love of country it the motive which Impels the North. Hate impels the South. Love will elwayt triumph over hate. The chief loureet of cur national life are three : love of home, love of country and love of Ood. The latter it nligion, or the recog nition of duty. This last influence hat lets credit Rlren it than it deserves. Ask any man why ho enlisted. His reply it : & body mmt J ? That nligion thus denned is thus powerful, is witnessed both ia the orlgta and history of the nation. At this point the Doctor took occasion to viodicate Puritanism.
