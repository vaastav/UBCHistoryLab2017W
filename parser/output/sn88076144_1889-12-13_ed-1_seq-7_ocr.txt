Object of the Visit of Northern Pacific Official to Washing ton at This Time. National Aid to Be Solicited for the Purpose ot Promoting Needed Irrigation. The Northern Pacific Railroad to Guarantee the Bonds of Any Irrigation Company. Representatives of Western and Northwestern States Will Pull Together in Congress- A special telegram says there has been more or less speculation in Washington as to the object ot the Northern Pacific offi cials in Washington at the present time. On the 7th inst. Messrs. Oakos, McNaugh. ton and Hannalord gave a dinner to the new state andJMinnesota members. It is a fact tbat one or two stayed away be cause they were not aware o! the object of the gathering and because a eneer is ever cast upon the member who is supposed to be too friendly with the railroad officials. The Northern Pacific officials exp^ined what they were doing here and have met with the hearty co-ope ation of all the new state senator and representatives. Their road travers es a country which ia in more need of irri gation than almost any other section. In each of the legislatures of the new states a bill has or will lie introduced authorizing the Northern Pacific railroad to guarantee the bonds of any irrigating company that may be organized for the lands or furnishing settlers with water. But before any such scheme as that is put in operation, the officials of the road have determined to make a great effort to secure government aid first, and state aid if that fails. They anticipate a great deal of 

OPPOSITION FROM WESTERN MEMREItS, and they are now making the first effort to get the new state senators and members to solidify themselves, not only on this ques tion but on others, and being joined by the delegations from Nevada, Colorado, California, and perhaps Kansas, they can form such a strong irrigation party as to gain for them something in the way of national support. It has been suggested that the precent desert land law should be repealed and these lands should be grant ed to the several states to be used as the legislature sees fit in promoting irrigation. Nothing will be done pt present until Senator Stewart's committee makes TO ACT 

UNITEDLY. The Northwestern association, made up of senators and representatives from that part of the country, was foramly organ ized at Washington, D, C., on the Tth inst. It covers a broader field than was contem plated when the new-state men first got together, and, as decided on included near ly a third of the territory ol the Union. Senator Stewart, the silver-haired veteran from Nevada, presided. The states and territories included are North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorda, Ida do and Wyoming. A proposition to inclnde Kansas and Nebraska was unfavorably considered as be ing too far east and having too large delegations. Minnesota was also considered too lar east. Tbe purpose of the association is to act unitedly on all questions of a local nature where common interests are involved. Chief among these interests are those pertaining to irrigation and silver mining, and on these questions a pretty solid front will be presented. North Dakota alone not being asilver pro ducer, tbe cereal element will also be a prominent one. It is officially stat ed by the movers that the association is to be non-partisan, Democrats and Repub licans alike being eligible to membership. It was voted to ask publishers of newspapers in the aboTe states to send copies to be placed on file, and a general invitation was extended to all vis itors from these states to enjoy the associ ation's hospitality. A committee com prising Senator Stewart, Congressman Car ter and Delegate Casey ot Wyoming was appointed to perfect the roll of member ship and take charge of the preliminaries until the permanent organization is com pleted and adopted. Senators and repre sentatives from the states named, except California and Colorado, were present and pledged themselves to the organization. Carried Their Point. Senator Pettigrew and Representative Pickler and Hansbrough have been making a fight for a few days past upon Examiner Hall, of thj frauds division of the general land office, and they have succeeded in haying him transferred to another division. It is said to be this man Hall who has held up so many proofs of Western settlers upon the slightest technicality. He was an appointee of Sparks, came from North Carolina, and knew nothing of the West or its people. A practical man has been found to take his place. It is said that had he not been protected by the civil service rules his dismissal would have been insist ed upon by the Western members. Raised a Check. Max Garterlaub, a Jew who was at work in a bankrupt clothing store in Sauk Cen ter, Minn., was arrested a few days ago for raising the amount of a check. The check was given by Capt. L. E. Coe, proprietor of the Sauk Center bouse, to one of his hired girls and sbe^gave it in exchange for goods at the store. Garterlaub will prob ably go to the penitentiary, as the evidence iB strong against him and he will be pushed as hard aa possible, aB great indignation -a felt against him. Shot His Sweetheart. Casper Clispy WM a machinist, 27 years old, and loved Mary Anson, aged 22, a daughter ol John Anson, also a machinist and co-worker ot Clispy's in the Missouri 1 itB report. It is anticipated that it will not be entirely satisfactory, and thero is a fear that it will take at least ten years to work out the scheme. Meanwhile tho settlers in the West will have been forced to move away. Mr. McNaughton says something that can be put into active use at once is what is needed, and in their efforts to fur ther the scheme, they first bring the senat ors and representatives of those states to gether and secure a unity of purpose. It ia expected that not only the Northern Pa cific states, but South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin will be interested—South Dakota being interested in irrigation, and Minnesota and Wisconsin in anything that will promote this interests, and especially the raising of wheat in the country tribu tary to their great lakes. Pacific railroad ehopa, at St. Louis, Mo. Clispy was a confirmed opium-eater, and Anson had forbade him visiting hi« daugh ter. A Tew minutes before 6 o'clock on the Ckpy went to Anson's house. Hickory street. The family were at breakfast. Some angry words passed be tween the men, when Clispy drew a revolver and fired at Anson, inflicting a mortal wound. He then shot his sweetheart,fMary, and her younger sister, Agnes, aged 17, fatally wounding the former and seriously injuring the latter. All fell to the fioor« and while they 1 there bleeding the distracted mur derer placed^his pistol to his own head and blew his brains out, dying in half an hour. •His body was taken to the morgue and physicians were called to attend the wound ed Alisons. It is thought the murderer was insane over being refused admission to the house by Anson. Hostile to Strangers. A special telegram from Pierre, South Dakota, says there is great indignation and excitement there over the hostile and lawless action of the squaw men an half breed dwellers of Fort Pierre towards Pierre citizens and strangers who happen to cross the river. A newspaper reporter named Bricgs, who went over there, was violently treated, ana had to run from the village to escape bodily injury. While there he was victimized in an outrageous manner out of $200, and upon complaint was threatened with violeoce and was chased from the town. An aged gentleman named Judge Waldron was also notified by the vigilance committee to leave the reservation. The hostility to Btrangers, and especially Pierre citizens, is becoming such that none venture across the river. There bulldozing tactics are car ried on by these people so that they can control the situation upon the opening of the reservation, and thus obtain prestige over intending sttlers. There is no doubt that the government will have to interfere before long, as thei« is now no law thai can reach the inhabitants of the reserva tion. Serious threats have also been made by Fort Pierrettes to newspaper men and correspondents who dare to reveal the true state of affairs. Coroner's Verdict. The coroner's jury in the inquest on the bodies of the victims of the Minneapolis Tribune building fire brought in a verdict on the 5th inst. The finding occupies thirty-eight closely written pages. The verdict declares that the owners of the Tribune building, if not legally responsible, are morally culpable for the loss of life. They recommend that the assistant building inspector occupy his whole time in looking after fire escapes. They find that the fire originated in the room of the Republican League (unoccupied) from causes unknown. In conclusion, the verdictsays: "Seventh, in our opinion had it not been for the ob struction met with in electric wires, lad ders would have been erected in time to have saved all the people that were in the sixth and seventh stories at the time of the arrival of the fire department at the scene of the tire, and that Robt. McCutch eon would not have fallen and perhaps others would liavt availed themselves of the opportunity offered by the fire depart ment ladders instead of braving the fire and smoke to reach the fireescape. There fore we would recommend that the city authorities take summary steps to have all overhead wires in the city put under ground." Fought With Rapibrs. A duel was fought near Pomona, Cal., a few days ago in strict accordance with the code. The affair was kept secret, but not withstanding the care exercised to keep it from the public the fact came out. Since October last two prominent young men of Pomona, Harry Lucas, formerly of Lou isiana, lierbert Priestly, both aged 19, have been rivals for the band of a youne lady of excellent family. They have had frequent quarrels and recently came to blows. Finally Lucas challenged Priestly to fight with Spanish rapiers. The chal lenge was accepted and the two men met in the ball ground. Lu cas, who is both wiry and quick and a practiced fencer, was quickly seen to be the better of the two. The arrange ments were for three-minute bouts. At the end of the second bout when Priestly had been cut in the breaBt and head and twice in the shoulder, the seconds became alarm ed and stopped the fight. Priestly's wounds were dressed and he was taken away from town. Lucas has also disappeared. The seconds are known, but no arrests have been made. The young men are of good family, and the story of the fight has caus ed much excitement. Canada Getting Ready for War. Members of the order of the Sons of Eng land in Canada are petitioning the Imper ial Admirality authorities in England, for the establishment in the Dominion of two branches of the Royal Naval Reserve, one at some point ol the Atlantic seaboard and the other on the lakes. The latter branch, it is claimed, would be readily joined by the lake seamen, who would man a lake flotilla more satisfactorily than ocean seamen unacquainted with the pecul iarities ol lake craft and inland navigation. Sault Ste. Marie is suggested as the right spot at which to locate the Reserve to be stationed on the laktiB. A more important point, it is held, could not be selected, nor onn more conveniently situated for reach ing the greatest inland seas. Seated mid land between Lakes Huron and Superior, the superiority of that position, itlsclaim ed, could not be questioned, nor the vast interests immediately brought within reach of an important naval depot. A Catholic Bank. The New York Herald says: A most stupendeous enterprise is on foot. It is one that will create a profound sensation throughout the world. The people of America will receive the news with vari ous emotions. The Universal Association Bank and Trust company is about to be formed in this city under tbe special bene diction of the pope of Rome, with a capi tal of $100,000,000, to receive, care for and Invest not only the enormous reve nues of the church, but the private fortunes of its members. The moneys of all other persons and sects are to be received and invested as well. The Herald devotes a whole page.to this great scheme. Erwln Exploded a Bomb. A bombshell was exploded among the state's attorneys in the Revoir murder trial at Hudson, Wis., a few days ago by Erwin, of tbe defense, who claimed that one of the jurors was not a citizen, as claimed. The court took a recess to de termine the matter. Holden, the juror, had resided in Hudson for thirty years, and supposed his father had acquired citi zenship. The eHect may be to cause a new trial, and much greater expense than in the present case. The trial on the murder issue will be postponed if the court rules with defense, as seems probable. Fifty First Congress. It Is Opened Under Very Favor able Auspices, and Per manently Organized. Tbe Senators and Representa tives From tbe New States Talse Tbeir Seats. All Hut One of tbe Republican Caucus Nominees of tbe House Elected. Seriate. Little or no excitement attended the opening of the Fifty-first congress on the Benate side of the capitol. Public curios ity seemed to be largely transferred to the houBe side. Several of the foreign dele gates to the maritime and Pan-American conferences and a number of ladies occu pied seats in the diplomatic gallery. Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British minister, and Admiral Kazenhoff, of the Russian navy, were among those present. The interest on the floor was devoted largely to thesenators fromthe new states. They had had seats assigned them on tbe repub lican side of the chamber. Senator Casey, of North Dakota, took his seat! on the end of the second row against the north wall directly behind nim sat the Waahing- senatorB, ton Allen and Squire, while Pettig-ew and Moody, of South Dakota, were in the fourth row, near the center of the room. Senator Pierce, of North Da kota, ha9 the end seat in the fourth row. On the democratic side are two seats, BO Tar unaligned. They will bo occupied by tbe senators from Montana, when they shall have been chosen. Flowers adorned the desks of several member's. At noon Vice President Morton entered the chamber, and Chaplain Rev. J. G. Butler opened the proceedings with an in vocation for devine blessing. The oath of office was then administered by the vice president to Senator Chandler, of New Hampshire, for bin new term. Tbe creden tials of Nathun F. Dixon, senatcr-elect from Rhode Island, were presented and read and oath of office administered to him. The credentials of Moody and Petti grew, senators-elect from the new state oi South Dakota, were presented by Piatt and Spooner and those of Allen and Squire, of Washington, were presented by the vice president. The several credentials hav'eing been read, Mr. Piatt moved tbat the oath of oliice be administered to the four new senators. The motion was agreed to and the four new senators, each of them escorted by a senator, proceeded to the clerk's desk, amid some applause from the gallariej, and took the oath of office. Mr. Hoar offered a resolution providing a mode for assigning the senators from the states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington to their respective classes (in relation to the period at which their terms will expire) and moved its reference to the committee on privileges and elec tions. His resolutions, he Baid, proceeded on the theory that the senators from the three states mentioned stood on an entire equality with reference to this opportunity to be assigned to a shorter or longer term, the three states were all admitted under The same act of congress. They wore all admitted by virtue of proceedings that took place in them on tbe same day. The fact that tbe proclamations evidencing the admission oi the two Dakotas preceding that of Washington, by two days was due to the accident of greater distance of the latter, so that the evidence of the proceed ings had not reached the department of state at the same time. This gave to the two Dakotas no just title to priority. The resolution was referred. Edmunds and Harris wore then appoint ed a committee to join a like committee from the house to inform the president that congress was ready to receive any communication he may choose to make. A resolution providing for the continuance of the select committee on transportation and sale of meat products was agreed to. Aldrich offered a resolution (which was laid over) .for the appointment of a select committee of nine senators, to be called) tbe quadro centennial committee, to which shall be referred all matters connected with the proposed celebration of the four hun dredth anniversary of the discovery of America. The senate then, at 12:35, adjourned. 

ROUSE. 4s the heavy gallery doors swung out ward on their hingeB there was a wild rush for seats and in a few moments there was standing room only in the wide portals. On the floor members mingled together, chatting and laughing. As the hour of noon approached the noise and confusion increased upon the floor and the executive and diplomatic galleries were filled. As the hands of the clock pointed to the hour of 12 Clerk Clark called the house to ordei and proceeded to read the roll of members-elect. The roll call showed the presence of 327 members. More than a quorum having been dis closed, mominations for sneaker were in order and Mr. Reed was placed in nomina tion by Henderson, of Illinois. The men tion of Reed's name was the signal for ap plause an the republican side which was returned with interest by the democrats when McCreary, of Kentucky, nominated Mr. Carlisle for this honorable position. The vote resulted: Raed 16G Carlisle 154 for Cuminings of New York 1 (Cowles ot North Carolina), and Mr. Reed having been declared elected speaker was escorted to the cbair by McKiniey and Carlisle, amid applause, and the oath of office ad ministered by Mr. Kelley, ofPennsylvania. On assuming the chair, Speaker Reed said: Gentlemen of the House ot Representa tives, 1 thank you for the high office which your voices have bestowed upon me. It would be impossible not to be moved bv its dignity and honor, yet you may well imagine tnat I am at this moment more impressed by its responsibilities and du ties. Under our system of government as it has been developed, these responsibili* ties and duties are both political and par liamentary. So far as the duties are poli tical, I sincerely hope that they may be performed with a proper sense of what is due to all people of the whole country. So far as they are parliamentary. I hope with equal sincerity that they may be per formed with a proper sense of what is due to both sides of thechamber. (Applause.) To the end that I may be successful in car rying out your wishes, I invoke the con siderate judgment and cordial aid of all members ot this house. (Long continued applause.) The next step in organization of the house was swearing in ot the members elect and as tney ranged themselves in squads of twenty at a time in the space in front of the clerk's desk tbe oath was ad ministered by the speaker. When this duty was finished the house proceeded to the eleotioa ot other officers. Edward McPheraon was elected clerk, A. F. Homes sergeant-at-arms, A. A. Adams doorkeeper, and Jas. L. Wheat, postmas ter. When It came to the election of fchaplain, there was a fight, and Rev. Charles D. Ramsdell, nominee of the republican cau cus, was defeated and the chaplain ot the last house, William H. Milburn re-elected. Those officers were then eworn in. Messrs. McKiniey, Cannon and Carlisle were then appointed a committee to inform thepresi dont that the house was organized and ready to proceed to business. After the casting of lots for a choice ol seats had taken place, Mr. Bayne, of Penn sylvania, offered a resolution directimg the speaker to appoint committees on rules, ncts,_ enrolled bills and mileage, each to consist of the same number of members as provided for by the rules of the Fiftieth congress, and referring the rules of the Fif tieth congress to a committee on ruleB, Adopted. The house then adjourned. Senate. The Senate did not transact much busi ness on the third inst., but repaired to the house and listened to the presidents mes sage, and soon after returning adjourned. nocsE. The President's message was read to the two houses in joint session on the 3d inst., after which the speaker appointed Messrs. Bayne, Hitt, Carter, Culberson and Cutu rnings as a committee on celebration. Adjourned to Thursday. Senate. The senate devoted most of its session on December 4 to the introduction of bills the total number being 505 against 308 on the first bill day two years ago.

If the state shall elect to sell the lands the proceeds shall be used for construction and maintenance of reservoirs, ditches and other works for irrigation of such lands aa may be remuneratively produc tive. If the land is given to settlers, it is to be taxed and the proceeds applied to irrigation purposes. The senate then proceeded to executive business and soon adjourned. The drawing by lot of the terms ot the new senators resulted as follows: Of the Washington senators A. R. Squire was as signed to the class of senators whose terms expire March 3,1891. and Mr. Allen to the class expiring March, 1893 of the South Dakota senators. Mr. Moody's term expires March 3, 1891, and Mr. Pettigrew's March 3,1895 and of the North Dakota senators, Mr. Pierce's term expires March 3, 1891, and Mr. Casey's March 3,1893. Senate. Among the memorials and petitions pre sented on the 5 th inst. was one asking that the national title be changed to "The Unit ed States ol Columbia." A bill for the relief of the sufferers in the Samoan'disaster was presented. Another bill was for the protection ot federal officers in discharge of duty. A bill was introduced to aid and secure tbe commemoration of.the four hundredth anivcrsary of the discovery of America. The vice president having notified the senate ho would be absent from the city two or three days next week. Mr. Ingalls was elected president pro tempore, during the absence of the vice president. The senate then adjourned until Mon day. The speaker laid before the house the following communication from J. P. Lee dem, late sargeant at arms of the house, directed to the spsaker: "I regret to re port that C. E. Silcott, late cashier ot the office of the sergeant at arms, iV.- has depart­ ed from this city without settling his ac counts, and I have been unable to ascer tain his whereabouts, and there is a defi ciency in the cash ol the office. In view ot theBe circumstances, I respectfully request an immediate investigation ot my accounts under such action as the house ot repre sentatives may take in the premises." Mr. Adams ot Illinois, therefore offered i» the following resolution, which was unani mouslv adopted: Whereas, J. P. Leedom, late sergeant-at arms of the house of representatives has reported to the house that C. E. Silcott, late cashier of the office of the sergeant-at arms. has departed from this city without settling his accounts, and his whereabouts are unknown, and there is a deficiency in tbexash in said office of about $75,000. ReBoived—That a select committee be appointed by the speaker to examine iw accounts of said office and report thereup on to the house. A committee which has authority to administer oaths and reports in whole or part at any time, was appointed by the speaker as follows: Adams, Stewart of Vermont, Payne, Reed of Iowa, Holiuan, Blount, and Hemphill. It appears that Silcott got away with $72,000, perhaps more. His offense is not extraditable, and if he is in Canada he is for the present out of the power of the United States officers. Among the members of the house who lose personal effects are Pickler of South Dakota,$600 J. D. Taylor, of Ohio $3,000 and the Minnesota members $3,000. Among the bills introduced in the senate were the following: By Senator Moody—Directing secretary of the interior to cause necessary surveys to be made and artesian wells to be sunk to develope the artesian basin underlying the state of South Dakota, with a view to tbe use of tho waters for irrigation. An appropriation of $15,000 is asked for also a bill to prohibit officers and agents of the government from requiring payment of special taxes under the inter nal revenue laws for tho manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors in states where such manufacture or sale is prohibited by the state constitution. Roferred. By Mitchell—Providing that any person or association which lor any reason fails to make good its entry to public land and abandons tho same shall have a right to make another entry under the land laws. Senate. Among the numerous bills introduced and referred in the senate on the 9th inst. were two for the admission of the states of Idaho and Wyoming into the Union. Turpie offered a resolution that the proposed penal enactments agaiuBt trusts, affecting commerce among tho several states, should provide for the seizure of trust goods on lawful war rant and information, and for tho forfeit ure, confiscation and sale of the same. He aBked that tho resolution be laid on the table, and gave notice that he would call it upon the 10th inst., tor the purpose of submitting some remarks upon it. Pierce introduced a bill to create the of fice of surveyor general in North Dakota. 

HOUSE:. In the bouse Mr. Payne, of New York, in troduced a bill defining the duties of tho sergeant-at-armB of th« house of represen tatives. It defines the duties already per formed by that officer, and then pro ceeds: "The moneys which have been, or may lie appropriated for com pensation and mileage shall be paid at the treasury on a requisition drawn by tho clerk or the sergeant-at arms, 'shall be kept, disbursed and ac counted for by him according to law, and he shall be the disbursing officer." He shall give bonds in the sum of $50,000, which Bhall be disposited in the office of the first comptroller of the treasury. The bill was referred to a special investigating committee, with leave to report at any time. A number of resolutions were then in troduced and referred, after which the speaker surprised a majority of the mem bers by the appointment of the commit tees on appropriations, manufactures, elections, mileage and ways and means. McKiniey heads the ways and means committee and Burrows, Carlisle and Mills are among its members. Cannon is chairman of appropriations, and for coadjutors has Butterworth, Hen derson, Randall and others. "Pig Iron" Kelley leads the committee of elections, over which Rowell will preside, while Lind is chairman of the mileage com mittee. 

MISPLACED SWITCH. A Passenger Train Derailed and One Man Killed. The New York limited express, west bound, over the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern road, was wrecked at Pine Park, a sand-shipping station, thirty-five miles east of Chicago, on the 7th inBt. The acci­ dent was caused by a misplaced switch which throw tho passenger train into a train of empty sand cars standing on the side track. On stricking the switch the engineer reversed his engine and put on brakes, but as the train was going at the rate of forty miles an hour and the cars were but a lew rods away from the switch, he was unable to avsid the crash. The train consisted of one baggage car, two coaches, two sleepers and a chair car. The locomotive was thrown across the main track and totally Wrecked, the three front cars l^ing crushed to pieces. It is little less than a miracle that tbe passen gers escaped serious injury. As it was, one railroad employe was fatally hurt, two others sustaining serious injury. When the collision occurred a number of tbe passengers were thrown from their seats, but, beyond a few slight bruises, none were hurt. They were all placed in the two uninjured coaches and taken to Chesterton, lad., when they proceeded over the Michigan Central. The east bound passenger train broke the switch, but passed over it safely, and no other train passed over the track until the west bound train came along. A Good System. Th» annua report of the civil service com mission calls special attention to the need of adequate means to carry on tbe work. The number ot applicants examined the fiecal year was nearly double that of the proceeding year, while the working force remained exactly the same, The commis sion asks for an appropriation of $53,000 the next fiscal year. After reviewing the change and improvements in systems at great length the report says the merit of tho system of making appointments a contrasted with the patronage system is no longer in an experimental stage. Wher ever its trial has been fair tbe system has worked admirably. Weekly Commercial Report. R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade saye: No disturbance appears to have re sulted as yet from the Lynn and Boston fires and the free offerings ot bonds to the treasury make the monetary prospect clearer. In all other respects the events of the past week have but add ed to the prevailing confidence in the fu ture of business, and the opening of congress, with the annual message and re ports, have had a decidedly encourag ing influence. Reports of business in dicates some tailing off at the west which is considered temporary at Chicago and attributed to open and unseasonable weather at Milwaukee where dealers ap pear apprehensive and collections are only fair. Some difficulty affects the clothing trade at Cleveland, and is called the cause ot the. depression in the coat trade. But nearly all reports indicate that urn business is satisfactory. Pittsburg njStef an improved demand ayd hlyiek.. prices in iron and in flint glass, win-rf$? dow glass being unchanged. The specula-'Af tive markets for products have been \r" strong, but not very active. The general tendency of prices is still upward, the rise since November 30th having averaged 4 per cent for all commodities. In the stock market there was a serious depression at the end of last week and on Monday, but since that time there has been some recov ery, with considerable foreign buying. Business failures number 31G, as compar ed with a total of 2-12 last week. For the corresponding week of laBt year the figures were 3-05. GRAND OPJBXING. The Croat Chicago Auditorium ia Opened in a Most Brilliant Man ner. An audience of 5,000 people and an out side assemblage of 10.0UU enthusiastic spectators witnessed the dedication of the largest and grandest operatic structure in the world, the Chicago auditorium at that city on the evening of the 9th inst. Five thousaud electric lights illuminated tho interior of the colossal structure to the light of noonday, and a thousand incandescent border lights of varied. colors hung over the stage. The mammoth or gan in the grand foyer and carved ma hogony pillars, the handsomest gilded rows of boxes known to modern decorative art, combined with the presence of one of the most distinguished and critical audienc es in America, rendered tho occasion truly one long to be remembered by tho queen of the evening—Madame Adelina Patti, the sovereign of sons. A few minutes past 8 clock the presidential party entered the boxes reserved for tbem, and as the vast audience fully recognized the chief magistrate of the nation the momentary applause deepened to a long and continued ovation. The magnificent 17.Vet op) organ, with its 7,000 pipes and bells, breathed forth inanaccompainment with tbe orches tra the triumphal fantasia composed by Theodore Dubois for the memorable occa sion. The scene was one long to be remem bered. Beauty crowned with jewels, states manship with honor and wealth with digni ty, harmonized becomingly with the magni ficence of tbe interior of this grand temple ot art. There was another burst of applause as Mayor Crogier was seen advancing to the front of the mammoth stage, seventy teet deep and ninety feet in width. In ap propriate language Mayor Cregier wel comed the guests of the evening, and to every courteous allusion to the president, governors of surrounding states and offi cers of Canadian provinces the audience responded with rounds of applause. After one or two others had been presented President Harrison was introduced and spoke appropriately. A cantata composed for the occasion by Frederick G. Glasson, was sung by a cho rus of 500 voiceB, after which Hon. Jno. S. Runnels, of Chicago, delivered an ad dress complimenting the anditorium asso ciation upon its triumph and paying a frequent tribute to the guest of the even ing, the president of the United States. Madame Patti then evoked a storm of applaute by the sweetness and strength of song. The Appolo club sang, and a dedi catory address by Gov. Fifer, completed the program.
