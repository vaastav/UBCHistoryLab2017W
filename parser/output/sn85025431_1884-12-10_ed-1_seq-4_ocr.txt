KING'S EVIL "Was the name formerly given to Scrofula because of a superstition that it could be cured by a king's touch. The world Is wiser now, and knows that SCROFULA can only be cured by a thorough purifica­ tion of the blood. If this is neglected, the disease perpetuates its taint through generation after generation. Among its earlier symptomatic developments are Eczema, Cutaneous Eruptions, Tu­ mors, Boils, Carbuncles, Erysipelas, Purulent Ulcers, Nervous and Phy­ sical Collapse, etc. If allowed to con­ tinue, Rheumatism, Scrofulous Ca­ tarrh, Kidney and Liver Diseases, Tubercular Consumption, and vari­ ous other dangerous or fatal maladies, are produced by it. Ayer's Sarsaparil/a Is the only powerful and always reliable blood-purifying medicine. It is so effect­ ual an alterative that it eradicates from the system Hereditary Scrofula, and the kindred poisons of contagious diseases Mid mercury. At the same time it en riches and vitalizes the blood, restorin healthful action to the vital organs ami rejuvenating the entire system. This great Regenerative Medicine Is composed of the genuine Honduras Sarsaparilla, with Yellow Dock, Stil lingia, the Iodides of Potassium and Iron, and other ingredients of great po­ tency, carefully and scientifically com­ pounded. Its formula is generally known to the medical profession, and the best physicians constantly prescribe AYER'S SARSAPARILLA as an Absolute Cure For all diseases caused by the vitiation of the blood. It is concentrated to the high­ est practicable degree, far beyond any other preparation for which like effects are claimed, and is therefore the cheapest, as Well as the best blood purifying medi" cine, in the world.

The many great improvements intro­ duced in the manufacture of the Jas. Boss' Gold Watch Case, have led to similar im­ provements in the making of silver cases. Under the old methods, each part of a silver case was made of several pieces of metal soldered together, requiring a great amount of cutting and 6oldering, which softened the metal and gave it the pliability of lead rather than the elasticity of silver. Under the improved methods, each part of the Keystone Silver Watch Case is made of one solid piece of metal hammered into shape. fcThe advantages are readily appar­ ent, for every one knows that hammei*ing hardens the metal while soldering softens it. To test the superiority of the Keystone Silver Watch Case, take one of 3 oz. weight, press it squarely in the center when closed, and it will not give, while a case of same weight of any other make will give enough to break the crystal. The Keystone Silver Watch Case is made only with silver cap and gold joints.

WASHINGTON, Deo. 1.—Following is the foil text of President Arthur's me* sage, as delivered to Congress to-day: To TUB 

COKGKXM or THK UNITEDSTATES: SINCE the close of your but session, the ijatrleta peo­ ple, In the exercise of their hlgheit right or suf­ frage. have chosen their chief magistrate for the four years ensuing. When It Is remembered that at no period In the country's history has the long Solltlcal contest which customarily precedes the ay of the national election been waged with greater fervor and Intensity, it is a subject of con­ gratulation that alter the controversy at the pniis was over and while the slight preponderance by which the Issue had been determined was as yet unascertained, the public peace suffered no dls turbance. but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited th£ result. Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American citizen, his love of order and his loy­ alty to law. Nothing could more Signally dem­ onstrate the strength and wisdom of our polit­ ical institutions. Eight years have passed since a controversy concerning the result of a national election of the graven importance that this question he solved before conflicting claims to the presidency shall again distract the country, and I am per­ suaded that by the people at large any of the measures of relief thus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Our relations with all foreign powers continue to be amicable. With Belgium a convention has been signed whereby the scope of present treaties has been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either coun­ try within the jurisdiction ot the other equal rights in the acquisition and alienation of prop­ erty. A trade-mark treaty has also been con­ cluded. The war between Chili and Pern is at an end. For the arbitration of the claims of American citizens who during its continuance suffered through the acts of the Chiiiau authorities, a convention will soon be negotiated. The state of hostilities between France and China continues to be an embarrassing feature of our Eastern relations. The Chinese government hat promptly adjusted and paid the claim® of American citizens whose property was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton. I renew the rec­ ommendation of my last annual message that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China. The true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country permitting restriction of Chinese immigration is likely to be again the subject of your deliberations. It may be seriously ques­ tioned whether the statute passed at the last ses­ sion does not violate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return certifi­ cates, valid under the old law, and now seem to be debarred from landing from lack of certifi­ cates required by the new. The recent pur­ chases by the United states of a large trading fleet heretofore under the Chinese flag has con­ siderably enhanced our commercial importance in the East In view of the large number of vessels built or purchased by American citi­ zens in other countries and exclusively employed in legitimate traffic between foreign ports under the recognized protection of our flag, it might be well to provide a uniform rate for their regis­ tration and documentation, so that the bona fide property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly evinced and properly guarded. Pursuant to the advice ot the Senate at the last session, I recognized the flag of the International Association of the Congo as that of a friendly government, avoiding in so doing any pre-judg­ ment of conflict of International claims in that region. Subsequently in the execution of the expressed wish ot the congress. I appointed a commercial agent for the Congo basin. The im­ portance of the rich prospective trade of the Con­ go valley has led to a general conviction that it should be open to all nations upon equal terms. The international conference for the considera­ tion of this subject was called by the Emperor of Germany and is now in session at Berlin. Dele­ gates are in attendance on behalf of the United States. Of the results of the conference you will be duly advised. The government of Core* has generously aided the efforts of tie United States minister to secure suitable premises for the use of the legation. As the conditions of diplomatic intercourse with Eastern nations demand that the legation prem­ ises be owned by the represented power, I advise that an appropriation be made for the acquisi­ tion of this property by the government. The United States already possesses valuable premises at Tangier as a gift from the Sultan of Morocco. \s is stated hereafter, they nave lately received a imilar gift from the Siamese government. The •overnment of Japan stands ready to present to Is extensive grounds at Tokio, whereon to erect a uitable building for the legation, court-house nd jail and Bimilar privileges can probably be acured in China aud Persia. The owning of uch premiBes -would not only effect a large Bav ng ot present rentals, but would permit of the 3ue assertion of »-xlra-territorial rights in those countries, and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United Sta'es. The failure of Congress to make appropriation for our representation at the autonomous court ot the Khedive has forced a serious embarrass­ ment in our intercourse with Egypt aud in view ot the necessity of the intimacy of diplomatic relationship due fo the participation of this gov­ ernment as one of the treaty powers in all matters of administration there affecting the rights of foreigners, I advise the restoration of the agency aud consulate-general at Cairo on its former basis. I do not conceive it to be the wish of CougreSa that the United States should withdraw alto­ gether lrom the honorable position they have hitnerto held with respect to the Khedive, or that citizens of thi« republic residing or sojourn­ ing in Egypt should hereafter be without the aid and Drotection of a competent representative. With France the traditional cordial relation­ ship continues. The Bartholdi statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, the generous gift of the people of France, is expected to reach New York in May next, 1 suggest that congressional action be taken in relation to the spirit which has prompted this gift, and in aid ot the timely com­ pletion of the pedestal on which it is to be placed. Our relations with Germany, a country which contributes some of the best elements of our citizenship, continue to be cordial. The United states have extradition treaties with several of the German states, but by reason of the confederation of these states under the imperial rule, the appli­ cation ot such treaties is not as uniform and com­ prehensive as the interests of the two countries require. I propose, therefore, to open negotia­ tions for a convention of extradition to embrace all the territory of the empire. It affords me pleasure to say that our inter­ course with Great Britain continues to be ot a most friendly character. The government of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for seven years the pro­ visions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such continuance, in view of the relations of that country to the American system of states, should in my judgment be favored. The revolution In government has terminated. While it was in progress it became necessary to enforce our neu­ trality laws by instituting proceedings ngninot individuals and vessels charged with their in­ fringement. These proceedings were in all successful. 1 nst the established Much anxiety has lately been displayed by various European governments, and especially by the government of Italy, lor the abolition of our import duties upon works of art It is well to consider whether the present discrimination in favor of the American artists abroad is not likely to result, as they themselves seem very generally to believe it may, in the practical exclusi of our painters and sculptois from the rich fields for observation, study and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed. There is prospect that the long pending revision of the foreign treaties of Japan may be concluded at anew conference to be held at Tokio and while this government fully recognizes the equal tnd independent station of Japan in the com­ munity of nations, it would not oppose the gen* (ral adoption of such terms of compromise as Japan may be disposed to offer in furtherance of uniform policy ot intercourse with Western na­ tions. During the past year the Increasing good will between our own government and that of Mexico has been variously manifested. The treaty oi commercial reciprocity concluded January 20, 1883| bas been ratified and awaita the necessary tariff legislation of Congress to become effective. The legislation will, I doubt not, be among the first measures to claim your attention. A full treaty of commerce, navigation and consular rights is much to be desired, and such a treaty, I have reason to believe, the Mexican government stands ready {o conclude. 8ome embarrassment has been occasioned by the failure of Congress at its last session to provide meana for the due exe tortheresur- the relocation oundary monuments. With the republic of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded which authorizes the construc­ tion by the United States of a canal, railway and telegraph line across the Nicaraguan territory. By the terms of this treaty sixty miles of the river Ban Juan, as well as Lake Nicaragua, an in­ land sea forty miles in width, are to constitute a part of the projected enterprise. This covers for actual canal construction seventeen miles on the Pacific side and thirty-six miles on the Atlantic. To the United States, whose rich territory on the Pacific is, for the ordinary purposes of commerce, practically cut off from communication by water with the Atlantic ports, the political and com­ mercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be over-estimated. It is believed that, when the treaty is laid before yon the justice and liberality of its provisions will command universal ap­ proval at home and abroad. The death of our representative at Russia while at his post at St. Petersburg, afforded io the im perial government a renewed opportunity to tes­ tify its sympathy in a manner befitting the inti­ mate friendliness which has ever marked the in­ tercourse of the two countries. The -course of thtt government in raising its representational .Bang Kok to the diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship, and augurs well Tor, our en­ larged interior. The Siamese government has presented to the United States a commodious mansion and grounds for the occupancy of the legation, and I suggest that by joint resolution Congress attest its appreciation of this generous gift This government has more than once been jailed on of late, to take action In the fulfillment the sacred rights of hospitality which our "SS tory affords, the officers of the government have been Instructed to increase vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West nd other ports near the Cnban coast lam when subsequently tried and convicted. The growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between the Spanish Antilles and their natural market In the united States, led to the adoption, In January last, of a commercial agreement looking to that end. This agreement has since been superceded by a more carefhlly (tamed and eomprehenalve convention whichl shall submit to the Senate for approval, has been the aim of this negotiation to open mush a favorad reciprocal exchange of jrodnetiona carried under the nag or either conn-, 'try as to make the intercourse between Cuba and orto Rico and ourselves scarcely lea intimate han the commercial movement between our do­ mestic ports, and to Insure a removal of the mrdens on shipping In the Spanish Indies, of which in the fast our ship owners and ship ••asters have so often had cause to complain^ Jv *1 citizens which were declared to be without the jurisdiction of the late Spanish-American Claims Commission, and which we therefore remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment The speedy settlement of these claims will now be urged by this government Negotlations for a treaty of commercial reci­ procity with the Dominion republic have been successfully concluded, and the result will shortly be laid before the Senate. Certain questions between the United States and the Ottoman empire still remain unsolved. Complaints In behalf of onuitisens are not satis­ factorily adjusted. The Porte has sought to with­ hold from our commerce the right of fkvored treatment to which we are entitled by existing conventional stipulations, and the revision ot the tariffs is unaccomplished. The final disposition of pending questions with Yenesnela has not as yet been reached, bnt I have good reason to expect an early settlement which will provide the means of re-examining the Caracas awards in conformity with the ex­ pressed desire of Congress, and which will recog­ nize the justice of certain claims preferred against Venezuela. The Central and Bonth American commission aopointed by authority of the act of July 18, 1884. will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished with Instructions which will be laid before you. They contain a statement of the general policy of the govern­ ment for enlarging its commercial intercourse with American states. The commissioners have been actively preparing for their responsible task by holding conferences in the principal cities with merchants and others interested in Central and'South American trade. THE 

MERIDIAN CONFERENCE. The international meridian conference lately convened in Washington upon the in* vitation of the government of the United States, was composed of representatives from twenty-five nations. The conierence concluded its labors on the 1st of November, hav­ ing with substantial unanimity agreed upon the meridian of Greenwich as the starting point whence longitude is to be computed, through 180 degrees eastward and westward, and upon the adoption for all purposes for which It may be found convenient, of a universal day which hall begin at midnight on the initial meridian and whose hours shall be counted from zero up to 24. The'formal report of the transactions of this con­ ference will be hereafter transmitted to Con- INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS. This government Is in frequent receipt of in vitations from foreign states to participate in inter national exhibitions, often of great interest and importance. Occupyipg, as we do. an advanced position on the world's production, and aiming to secure a profitable share lor our industries in the general competitive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the want of means for par­ ticipation in these exhibits should so often ex­ clude our producers from advantages enjoyed by those of other countries. During the past year the attention of Congress was drawn to the formal invitations in this regard tendered by the govern­ ments of England, Holland, Belgium, Germany and Austria. The executive has in some instances appointed honorary commissioners. This is, however, a most unsatis­ factory expedient for without some pro­ vision to meet the necessary working expenses of a commission it can affect little or nothing in be­ half of exhibitors. An intornational inventors' exhibition is to be held in London next May. This will coyer afield of special importance in which our country holds a foremost rank but the executive is at present powerless to organize a proper representation of our vast national in­ terests in this direction. I have in several pre­ vious messages referred to this subject It seems to me that a statute giving to the executive gener­ al discretionary authority to accept such invita­ tions and to appoint honorary commissioners without salary, and placing at the disposal of the secretary of state a small fund for defraying their reasonable expenses would be ol great public utility. 

MARITIMK REGULATIONS. This government has received official notice that the revised international regulations for pre­ venting collisions at sea have been adopted by all the leading maritime powers except the United States, and came into force on the 1ft of Septem­ ber last. For the due protection of our shipping interests, the provisions of our statutes Bhould at once be brought into consideration with these regulations. COFTOIGHT PRIVILEGES. The question of securing to authors, composers and artists copyright privileges in this country in return for reciprocal-rights abroad is one that may justly challenge your attention. It is true that a convention will be necessary for fully ac­ complishing this result but until Congress Rhall, by statute, Ax the extent to which foreign holders of copyright shall be here privileged, it has been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such conven­ tion. For this reason the United 8tates were not represented at the recent conference at Berne. THE NEUTRALITY LAWS. I recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States be so.enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our territory and aimed against the peace of a friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the fitting out ot annua expeditions and restrict the shipment of explosives. Though enactments in the latter respect were not framed with regard to International obligations, but simply for the protection of passenger travel, all these statutes were intended to meet special emergencies that had already arisen. Other emergencies have arisen since, and modern ingenuity supplies means ior organization of hos­ tilities without open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering parties. -1 fee no reason why overt preparations in this country for the commission of criminal acts tueh as are here under consider­ ation should not be alike punishable, whether such acts are intended to be committed in our own country or a foreign country with which we are at peace. The prompt and thorough treat­ ment of this question is one which intimately concerns Uie national honor. THE NATURALIZATION LAWS. Our existing naturalization laws also need re­ vising. Those sections relating to persons residing within the limits of the United States in 1795 and 1798 have now only a historical interest. Section 21,172, recognizing the citizenship of the children of naturalised parents, is ambiguous in its terns and partly obsolete. There are special provisions of law favoring the naturalization of those who serve in the army or in merchant vessels, while no similar privileges are granted those who serve in the navy or marine corps. A uniform rule of naturalisation, suih as the constitution con­ templates, should, among other things, clearly .define the statutes of persons born within the United States subject to a foreign power (sec. 1,992) and of minor children of fathers who have declared their in­ tention of becoming citizens, but have failed to periect their naturalization. It might be wise to provide for a central bureau of registry wherein should be filed authenticated transcripts of every record of naturalization in the several Federal and state courts, and to make provision also for the vacation or cancellation of such record in cases where fraud had been practiced upon the court by the applicant himself, or where he had removed or forfeited his acquired citizenship. A just and uniform law in this respect would strengthen the hands of the government pro­ tecting its citizens abroad, and would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of naturaliza­ tion with foreign countries. DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE. The legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular service certain changes and reductions which have been pro­ ductive of embarrassment. The population and commercial activity of our country are steadily on the increase, and are giving rise to new, vary­ ing and often delicate relationships with other countries. Our foreign establishment now em­ braces nearly double the area of operations that it did twenty years ago, and the confinement of such service within the limits of expenditure then established is not it seems to me, in accord ance with true economy. A community of 60, 000,000 people should be adequately represented in its iutercourse with foreign nations. A project for the reorganization of the consular service and for recasting the scheme of extra-territorial jurisdietlon is now before you. and if the limits oi a short session will not allow its fnll consideration, I trust you will not fail to make suitable provision for the present needs of the service. It has been custom­ ary to define in the appropriation acts the rank of each diplomatic office to which a salary is at­ tached. I suggest that this course be abandoned, and that it be left to the President, with the ad­ vice and consent of the SenatQ, to fix from Him to time the diplomatic grade of the representa­ tives of this government abroad, as may seem ad Yisable, provision being definitely made, how­ ever, aa now, lor the amount of salary attached to the respective stations. THE 

TRKASURT. The condition of our finances, and the opera' tions of the various branches of the public service which are connected with the treasury department are very fully discussed in the report of the secretary. It appears that the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended June30,1884, were Customs 9195,067,489 76 Internal revenue. 121,686,072 &i All other sources. 81,866,807 6o Total ordinary revenues 1348,519,869 92 The public expenditures during the same period were: Civil expenses 22,813,907 71 Foreign intercourse 1,260,766 37 Indians.... 6,476,999 29 For pensions 55,429,229 36 The military establishment, includ­ ing river and harbor improve­ ments ahd arsenals The naval establishment, Including vessels, machinery and improve- Instrlctof Columbia Interest on the public debt The sinking fund 39,429,603 86 ments at navy yard Miscellaneous expenditures, in­ cluding public buildings, light­ houses and collecting the rev­ enue Expenditures on account of the 17,292,601 44 .. 46,939,710 00 8,407,049 62 54,678,878 48 46,790,229 50 Total ordinary expenditures...1290,916,483 88 Leaving a surplus of 57,603,896.09. As com­ pared with the preceding fiscal year, there was a net decrease of over 121,000,000 in the amount of expenditure!. The aggregate receipts were less than those of the year previous by about 874,000,000. The falling off of revenue from customs made up nearly 20,000,000 of this deficiency,, and about 923,000,000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts from internal taxation. The secretary estimates the total re­ ceipts for the fecal year which will end June 30, 1885, at 9330,000,000 and the total ex­ penditures at 9390,630,201.16, in which are in­ cluded the interest on debt and amount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus for the entire year of about 9390,000,000. THE EXPORTS AND IMPORTS. The value of exports from the United States to foreign countries during tho year ending June 80,1884, was as follows: Domestic merchandise, •724,964,852 foreign merchandise, 915,648,757: to­ tal merchandise, 740,513,609: specie, 67.188,383: total exports of merchandise ana specie, 807,646,' 992. Tho cotton and cotton manufactures in­ cluded in this statement were valued at $208,900, 415, the breadstuff's at 9162,544,715, the provisions at 9114,416,547 and the mineral oils at 947,103,248. During the same period the imports were as follows: Merchandise, 9667,697,693 gold and •liver, #37,426,262 total, 705,123,955. More than per cent of the entire value of imported mer­ chandise consisted of the following articles: Sugar and molasses, 9108,884,274 wool and woolen manufactures, 953,542,292 silk and its manufact­ ures. 949.949.1S8 coffee, 949,688,705 iron and rteel .and manufactures thereof, 941,461,599 chemicals, 938,464.965 flax, hemp, jute and like substances and the manufactures thereof, 933.. 463,893 cotton and the manufactures of cotton, 30,454,476 hides and skins, other than fur skius, 932,350,906. THE SILVER" COINAOE. I concur with the Secretary Of the Treasury in recommending tfie Immediate suspension 01 the certificates. This Is a matter to whloh, in brmer communications, I have more than onee nvoked the attention ol the national legislature, appears tbat annually for the past six years there have been coined, in compliance with re* euirements of the act of February 28,1878, more than 27,000,000 silver dollais. The number of •liver dollars outstanding ti reported by the secretary to be nearly 185,000,000. whereof but little more than 40,000,000, or less than 22 per cent, are in actual circulation. The mere existence of this fket seems to me, to furn­ ish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute which has made such fact possible. But there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same direction. The secretary avows his conviction, that unless the coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended, silver is likely, at no distant day, to become our sole metallic standard, The commercial dis­ turbance and the impairment of national credit that would be thus occasioned, can scarcely be overestimated. I hope that the secretary's Bug. I (estions respecting the withdrawal irom circula ion of the one-dollar and two-dollar uotes will teceivey our approval. It is lilcely that a consldera hie portion of the sliver now incumbering the vaults in the treasurymlght thus find its way the currency. While trade dollanbave ceased, for the present at least, to be an element of active disturbance in our currency system, some pro­ vision should be made for their surrender to the government. In view of the circum­ stances under which they wereeoined and of the fact that they have never had a legal tender qual­ ity, there should be offered lor them only a slight advance over their bullion value. The secretary, iu the qpurse of his report considers the propriety of beautifying the designs of our subsidiary silver coins and ot so increasing thdfr weight that they may bear their due ratio of value of the standard dollar. His conclusions In this regard are cordially approved. 

EXCISE TAXi-S. In my annual message of 1882,1 recommended the abolition of all excise taxes except those re­ lating to distilled spirits. This recommendation Is now renewed, and in case these taxes shall be abolished, the revenues that wilt still remain to the government will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet its reasonable expenditures but will afford a surplus large enough to permit of •uch tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable, when the results of recent revenue laws and com­ mercial treaties shall have shown iu what quar­ ters these reductions can be moBt judiciously effected. OUE FOREIGN TRADE. One of the gravest of the problems which ap­ peal to the wisdom of Congress for solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means of in­ creasing our foreign trade and thus relieving the depression under which our industries are now languishing. The secretary of the treasury ad­ vises that the duty of investigating this subject be entrusted in the first instance to a competent commission. While lully recognizing the consid­ erations that may ce urged against this course, I am nevertheless of the opinion that on the whole no other would be likely to effect speedier-or bet­ ter results. OUR SHIPPING INTERESTS. That portion of the secretary's report which concerns the condition of our shipping interests eannot fail to command your attention. He em­ phatically recommends that as an incentive to the investment of American capital in American steamships, the government shall by liberal pay­ ments for mail transportation, or otherwise, lend its active assistance to individual enterprise, and declares his belief tbat unless that course be pur­ sued, our foreign carrying trade must remain as It is to-day, almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners. One phase of this subject is not espe fialiy prominent in view of tho repeal act of June 5(6, 1884, oi all salutary provisions arbitrarily com­ pelling American vessels to carry the mail* to and from the United States. As it is necessary to make provision to compensate the owners of such vessels for performing that service after April, 1885, it is hoped that the whole subject will re­ ceive early consideration that will lead to the enactment of such measures for the revival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of Congress may devise. THE REDEMPTION OW BONDS. The 3 per cent, bonds of the government to the amount of more than 100,000,000 have, since my last annual message, been redeemed by the treas­ ury. The bonds of that issue, still outstanding, amount to a little over 200,000,000, about one fourth of which will be retired through the op­ erations of the sinking fund, during the coming year. As these bonds still continue the chief basis or the circulation of the national banks, the question now to avert the contraction of the cur­ rency, caused by their retirement, is one of con­ stantly increasing importance. It seems to be pnerally conceded that the law governing this atter exacts from the banks excessive security and that on their present bond deposits a larger circulation than is now allowed, may be granted with safety. I hope that the bill which passed the Senate at. the last session, permitting the is­ sue of notes equal to the face value of deposited bonds, will commend itself to the approval of the House .of Representatives. WAR DEPARTMOrr. In the expenses of the War Department the secretary reports a decrease of more than 890.000, 000, ot which reduction 36,000,000 was effected in the expenditures for rivers and harbors, and 82, 700,000 in the expenditures for the quartermas­ ter's department Outside of that department the annual expenses of all the army bureaus proper (except possibly the ordnance bureau) are substantiajly nxed charges, which cannot be materially diminished without change in the nu­ merical strength of the army. The expenditures In the quartermaster's department can readily be subjected to administrative discretion, and it ia reported by the Secretary of War that, as a result of exercising such discretion in reducing the number of draught and pack animals in the army, the annual cost of suppand carilving ng for such animals is now 1,108,085.90 less than it was in 1882. The reports of military comnandera show that the last year has been*notable for its freedom from Indian outbreaks. In defiance of the President's proclamation of July 1,1884, certain intruders sought to make settlements in the Indian Terri­ tory. They were promptly removed by a detach ment of troops. During the past session ot Congress a bill to provide a suitable fire-proof building for the Army Medical Museum and the library of the surgeou-general's office received the approval of the Senate. A similar hill reported favorably to the House of Representatives Dy one of its com­ mittees is still pending before that body. It is hoped that during the coming session the meas­ ure may become a law, and thereafter immediate steps may be taken to secure a place of safe de­ posit tor these valuable collections now in a state of insecurity. The funds with which the works for the im provement of rivers and harbors were prosecuted during the psst year were derived from the ap­ propriations of the act of August 2 1882, together with such few balances as were on hand from "previous appropriations. The balance in the xeasury subject to requisition July 1. 1883, was 910,021,649.55. The amount appropriated during tlie fiscal year 1884 was 13,196,346.27, and the amount drawn from the treasury during the fiscal 8,228,703.54, leavings balance of 93,112, 63 in the treasury subject to requisition July 1884. year was 5 580. The Secretary of War submits the report of the Chief of Engineers as to the practicability ol protecting our important cities on seaboard by fortifications and other defenses able to repel modem methods of attack. The time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive and when the possible result of delay in making such preparations is seriously considered, delay seems inexcusable. For the most Important cities, those whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation, adequate defense, inclu­ sive of guns, may be made by the gradual ex­ penditure of 60,000,000, a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribution. An appropriation of about one-tenth of thsit amount is asked to begin the work, and I con­ cur with the Secretary of Wt* in urging that it be granted. The War Department is paoceeding with the Conversion of 10-inch smooth bore guns into 8-inch rifles by lining the former with tubes of forge 1 or of cold wrought iron. Fifty guns will be thus converted with this year. This, however, armament of war vessels. The report of the gun foundry board appointed April 2,1883, in pursuance of the act of March 3, 1883, was transmitted to Congress In a special message of February 8, 1884. In my message of March 26,1884,1 called attention to the recom­ mendation of the board that the government shomd encourage the production of a private •teel works of the required material for heavy eannon, and that two government factories, one for the army and one for the navy, should be es­ tablished for the fabrication of guns of such ma­ terial. No action having been taken, the board was subsequently reconvened to determine more' fully the plans and estimate for carrying out its recommendations. It has received information whicli Indicates that there are responsible steel manu­ facturers in this country who, although not pro­ vided at present with the necessary plant, are willing to construct the same and to make bids for contracts with the government for the supply of the requisite materials for the heaviest guns adapted to modern warfare, if a guaranteed order of sufficient magnitude, accompanied by positive appropnation extending over a series of years, shall be made by Congress. All doubts as to the feasibility of the plan being thus re­ moved, I renew my recommendation that such action be taken by Congress as will enable the government to construct its own ordnance upon Its own territory, and so to provide the arma­ ments demanded by considerations of national safety and honor. THE 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the secretary of the navy exhlb Its the progress which has been made in the new steel cruisers authorized by the acts of August 5. 1882, and March 8,1883. Of the four vessels un­ der contract, one, the Chicago, of 4,500 tons, is mote than half finished the Atlanta, 3,000 tons, has been successfully launched, and her machin­ ery la now fitting the Bo«ton, alsoof3,000 tons, is ready for launching, and the Dolphin, a flfapfttch steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for delivery. Cer­ tain adverse criticisms' upon the de­ signs of these cruisers ere discussed by the secretary who insists that the correctness of the conclusions reached by the advisory board and by the department has been demonstrated by fecent developments in ship-building abroad. The machinery of the donble-turreted monitors Puritan, Terror, and Amphttrite, contracted for under the act of March 8,1883, Is in process of construction. No work has been done during the past year on their armor tor lack of the necessary appropriations. A fourth monitor, the Monad Bock, still remains unfinished at the navy Siat icniHuiKwius uw inuueuuie suspension or the L-n'ss. &pprored February 18. lMTMmT axrML colnage of «ilw doUua, and of tbv bnuance of I ard in California. It is recommended early iBteps be taken to complete these vessels and to nrovide also an armament for the monitor Miantonomah. Tberecommenuations of the naval advisory board, approved by the de­ partment, comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500 tons, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavily-armed gun-boats, one light cruising run boat, one dispatch vessel armed with Hotch kiss cannon, one armored ram, and three torpedo boats. The general designs, all of which are calculated to meet the existing wants of the service, are now well advanced, and the con­ struction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant the necessary authoritv. The act of Congress approved August 7, 1882, authorised the removal to the United States of the bodies of Lieut Commander Geo. W. DeLong and his companions of the Jeannette expedition. The removal has been successfully accomplished by Lienta. Harbor and Bebnlts. The remains were taten from their graves In the Lena delta In March, 1883, and were retained at Yakulsk un­ til the following winter, the season b*ing too far advanced to admit of their trans portation. They arrived at New York February 20.1884, where they were received with suitable honors. I pursuance of the joint resolution of Gbn- nition w&i fitted out for ihertUw of iJrot. mm mesw£% Greety. U. 8. A., and of the party who had been engaged under Ma command in scientific obser­ vation at Lady Franklin Bay. The fleet consisted for the expedition were^promptly made by the Mcretonr of the navy, with the active co-opera Upnof the secretary of war. Commander Geo. W. Cpffln wM Plaraxi in command of the Alert, and Lieut, w. H. Emery In command of the Bear! The Thetis was entrusted to Commander Wlnfield whom also was assigned the superintendence of the entire expedi tion. Immediately upon Its arrival it Uperoavik the fleet began the dangerous naviga­ tion of Melville Bay, and in spite of every ob­ stacle reached Littleton Island on June 22, a fort­ night earlier than any vessel had before attained that point On the same day it crossed over to Cape Sabine, where Lieut. Greely and other sur­ vivors of his party were discovered. Alter t»Mnir on board thr living and the bodies of the dead, the relief ships sailed for St. Johns, where they arrived on July 18. They were appropriately re­ ceived at Portsmouth on August 1, and at New York on August 8. One of the bodies was landed at the former place and the others were put on shore at Governor's Island, and with the excep. tion of one which was interred in the National Cemetery were forwarded thence to the oestina tion indicated by friends. The organization and conduct of this relief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its success. In this, the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the Con­ gress of the United States, I cannot too strongly urge on its attention the duty of restoring our navy as rapidly as possible to the high state of efficiency which formerly characterized it As the long peace that has lulled us Into Into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturbed, it is plain that the policy ot strength­ ening this arm of the service is dictated by con­ siderations of wise, economy, of a- just regard lor pur future tranquility and of* a true appre­ ciation of the dignity and honor of the republic. THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The report of the postmaster-gent ral acquaints you witn the present condition and needs of tho postal service. It discloses the gratifying tact [hat the loss of revenue from the reduction in the rate of letter postage, as recommended in my message of December, 1882, and effected by the act. of March 3,1883, has been much less than was generally anticipated. My recommendation of this reduction was based upon the belief that the actual falling off in receipts from letter postage for the 3 ear immediately succeeding the change of the rate woald be 93,000,000, It has proved to be only *2,275,000. This is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to its former volume, by natural increases of sealed correspondence, and I confidently repeat, therefore, the recommendation of my last annual message, that the single rate of drop letters be reduced to one cent, wherever payment of two cents is now required by law. The double rat% Is only exacted at offices where the carrier sys- A—n is in operation, and it appears that at those ces the increase in tax upon local letters, defrays the cost, not only of its own collection and delivery, but of the collection and delivery of all mail matter. This is an Inequality that ought no longer to exist I approve the recommendation of the postmaster-general that the unit of weight in the rating of first-class mat­ ter should be one ounce instead of one-hall ounce as it now is. In view of the statistics fur­ nished by the department it may be well doubts ed whether the change would result in any loss ol revenue, That It would greatly promote'the convenience of the public is beyond dispute. The free-delivery system has been lately applied to five cities, and the total number of offices In which it is now in operation is 159. Experience shows that its adoption under proper conditions is equally ah accommodation to the public and an advantage to the postal service It is more than self-sustaining and, for the reasons urged by the Postmaster-General, may properly be ex­ tended. It is the opinion of that officer that it Is proper to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free-delivery offices may be secured by the payment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might be made effective by the em­ ployment of a special stamp whose cost should be commensurate with the expense of the extra service. In some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to outstrip the government mail carriers by affording far prompter transmission of letters and better facili­ ties than have hitherto been at the command of the post-office. It has always been the policy of the government to discourage such enterprises, and in no better way can that policy be main­ tained than in supplying the public with the' most effective mail service that, with due regard to its own interests, can be furnished for its ac­ commodation. THE 

DEPARTMENT OF JU8TIOE. The attorney-general renews the recommenda­ tions contained in his report of last year touching ees of witnesses and jurors. He favors radical changes in the fee bill the adoption of a system by which attorneys and marshals oftheOnited States should be compensated solely by salaries, and the erection by the government of a pnniten. tiary tor the confinement of offenders against its laws. Of the varied governmental concerns In charge of the interior department, the reports of its sec­ retary present an interesting summary. Among the topics deserving particular attention I refer you to his observations respecting our Indiant affairs, the pre-emption and timber-culture acts, the failure of railroad companies to take title to lands granted by the government and the opera­ tions of the pension office, the patent office, the census bureau and the bureau of edu­ cation. Allusion has been made already lo the circumstance that, both as between different Indian tribes and as between Indians and the whites, the past year has been one of un­ broken peace. In this circumstance the presi­ dent is glad to find justification for the policy ol the government in dealing with the Indian ques­ tion and confirmation of views which were fully expressed in his first communication to the For­ ty-seventh Congress. The secretary urges a new enactment of a statue for the punishment of crimes committed on Indian reservations, and recommends the passage of a bill, now pending in the House, of Representatives, for purchase of a tract of 18,000 square miles from the Sionx res­ ervation. Both these measures are worthy of ap­ proval. I concur with him, also, in advising the repeal of the pre-emption law, the enactment ot statutes resolving the present legal complica­ tions touching lapsed grants to railroad com­ panies, and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific railroads under such guaranty as shall ef­ fectually insure its ultimate payment. The re­ port of the Utah Commission will be read with interest It discloses the results of recent legisla­ tion looking to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that territory. I still oelieve that if that abominable practice can be suppressed by law.it can only be by the most radical it gisla tion consistent with restraints of the constitution. I would again recommendi therefore, that Con­ gress assume absolute political control or the ter­ ritory of Utah and provide for the appointment of a commission with such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their hands. THE 

EXTENSION OF TRADE. In the course of this communication reference has more than once been made to the policy ol this government as regards the extension of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare the general principles tbat should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts In this direction. The main conditions of the problem may be thus stated. We area people of mechanical pur­ suits, and fertile in invention. We cover a vast extent of territory, rich in agricultural production, and in nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful man­ ufacture, we have a system of production establishments more than sufficient to supplyour demands. The wages of labor are no where else so great The scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher morals and intellectual qualities that go to the making of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is In excess of the present needs ol the government There are elements from which it is sought t» devise a scheme by which without unfavorably changing the condition of workingmen our mer­ chant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets provided for that sale beyond* our borders of the manifold fruits of our Industrial enterprises. The problem ia complex and can" be solved by no single measure of innovation or reform. The countries of the American continent and the°adjacent islands are for the United States the natural market of sup­ ply and demand. It is from then that we should obtain what we do not produce, or do not produce In sufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus production of our fields, our mills and our work­ shops should fiow under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with for­ eign competition. Four paths of policy seem to point to this end. The first, a series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of America, which shall foster between us and them an unhampered movement of trade. The conditions of these treaties shonld be the free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce inreturn*for the admission free, or under a favored scheme of duties, of our own products, the benefits of such exchange to apply on these goods carried under the flag of the par­ ties to the contract. The lemoval on both side* from vessels so privileged of all ton­ nage dues and national imports so that their vessels may ply unhindered be­ tween onr ports and those of the other contract­ ing parties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade The removal or reduction of burdens on the ex­ ported products of those countries coming within the benefits of the treaties and the avoidance ol the technicalities, restrictions and penalties by which an intercourse with those countries is at present bampered. Second, by tbe establishment of the consular service of the United States on a salaried footing, permitting tbe relinquishment of consular fees, not only as respects vessels un­ der tbe national flag, hut also as respects ves­ sels of the treaty nations, carrying goods entitled to the benefia of the treaties. Thirdly, the enactment of measures to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United States. Fourthly, the establishment of an uniform currency basis for the countries ot America so that the coined products ot our mines may circulate on equal terms throughout the whole system of commonwealth. This would require a monetary union of America, whereby the output of the bullion-producing countries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver could be adjusted in conformity with the population, wealth and commercial needs of each. As many of the countries (urnish no. bullion to the common stoclr, the surplus production of our mines and mini might thus be utilized, and a step taken toward the general remonetization of silver. To the ac­ complishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained by separate treaties, tbe negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed, and the favor with which this enlarged policy has been received warrants the belief that its operations will erelong embrace all, or nearly all, the countries of this hemisphere. It Is by no means desirable, howerer, tbat the policy under consideration should be applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa should be sought by reducing the tariff' burdens. on such of their wares as neither we nor. the other American States are fitted to produce and thus enabling ourselves to obtaiu in return abetter market for our supplies of food of raw materials and of the manufactures in which we excel. It seems to me that many of embarrassing elements in the great national con­ flict between protection and free trade may thus1 turn to good account, that tlie revenue may be reduced so as no longer to overtax the people that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome that our shipping inter­ ests may be judiciously encouraged the curren­ cy fixed on a firm basis, and above all such an unity of Interests established among the states of the American system as will be of greet and evu-iaeiMiliic advantage to Uun all. All treaties in the line ot this policy which have beea negotiated or are in process of negotiationcointtii a provision deemed to be requisite under the chii]1 or the constitution limiting to the Uotuge oI Kcj'reaeututlvras the authority to originate bills ior raising revenue. THE 

OIVIL-8E1JVICE LAW. On the 29th of February last I transmitted to Congress the first annual report of the civil s« vice comniigsinn. together with the commu« nicutions from the heads of several executive depaitmenis of tho government, respecting the practical workings of the law under which the Commission had been acting. The good results therein foreshadowed had been more than realized. The system has fully answered the expectations of its Iriends in securing competent niiii laithful public servants, and in protecting the appointing officers oft he government from the jressure ol personal 11 portunity aud from the abor of examining the claims and pretension* of rival candidates for public employment. The 1 has had the unqualified support of the Presi­ dent aud of the heads of the several departments, and the membere ot the commission have per* formed their duties with zeal aud fidelity. Their rejiort will shortly be submitted, and will be ac­ companied by such recommendations for enlarg­ ing tlie scope of the existing statute as shall com­ mend themselves to the executive and the com­ missioners charged with the administration. BANKKUPTLAW. In view of the general aud persistent demand throughout the commercial community for a national bankrupt law, 1 hope that the differences ot sentiment which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the present session. THK CHOLERA. Hie pestilence which for the past two yean has been laging in the countries of the East re­ cently made its appearance In European ports with which we are in constant communication. 1 he then secretary of the treasury in pursuance of !i procl-tma'ion of the President, issued certaij regulations restricting and for a time prohibiting the imjwrtation of rags aud the admission of baggage of immigrants aud ot travelers arriving from 'nlectcd quarters. Lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law, I ap­ prove the recommendation of the present secre­ tary that Congress take action in the premises anil I also recommend the immediate adoption ot such measures as will be likely to war! off the dreaded epidemic and to mitigate its severity In case it shall uuhappily extend to our shores. A 

PENSION FOR GEN. GRANT. I recommend in recognition of the eminent scrvicts of UiysSes 8. Grant, late general of the armies ol' the United States, and twice President of this nation, that Congress confer upon him a suitable pension. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The annual report of the commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews the operations of the several departments of its municipal govern­ ment, I ask your careful considerations of its suggestions in respect to legislation, especially commending such as relate to a revision of the civil and criminal code( the performance of labor by persons sentenced to imprisonment in the Jail, the construction snd occupation of wharves along the river front and the erection of a suit­ able building for district offices. 

MEASURES IN GENERAL. Certain of the measures that seem to me neces­ sary and expedient, I have now, in obeyance to the Con-titution, recommended for your adop­ tion. AS respects others of no .less importance, I shall content myself with renewiug the commen­ dations already made to the Congress without restating tlie grounds upon which such recom­ mendations wgre based. 'I he preservation of forests on the public domain, the granting of government aid for popular education, the amendment of tlie federal constitution so as to make effective this disapproval by the president of particular items in appropriating hills, the en­ actment of statutes in regard to the filling of va­ cancies i» piesidential office and the determining of vexed questions respecting presidential inabil­ ity are measures which may justly receive your serious considerations.
