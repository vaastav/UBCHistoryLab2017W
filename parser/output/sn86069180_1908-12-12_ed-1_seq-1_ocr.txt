KENTUCKY IRISH AMERIcAN VOLUME XXINO 24 LOUISVILLE SATCiRDADECE1 IBER J2 1908 PRICE FIVE CENTS LANDLORDS viii Bo Forced to Do Without the Bonus if the Bill Passes Tenants Can Insist On Fewer I Years to Make Final Settlement 6Able 6 Irish Editor Explains l the Good Features of Land Dill GRAPPLES GREAT ECONOMIC EVIL t Writing of the new Irish land bill introduced by Secretary Birrell and < wrlch is now engrossing the atten tion of Parliament the editor of the Dundalk Democrat gives utterance to the following opinions 4That 4 as regards the congested dis tricts of the West it is fl bold and statesmanlike attempt to deal with a great economic evil That HO far as the bargains completed before No vember 1 are concerned the bill while recognizing the obligations im posed by Wyndhams act affords a welcome relief to the Irish taxpayer from the intolerable burden which the flotation of fiftytwo millions of stock under the old conditions would have placed upon him but that as regards future sales the bill lessens rather than increases the prospects of mutual arrangement between landlords and tenants t while provid ing no compulsion to replace tho diminished inducements offered to the former to part with estates the value of which the operation of the Wyndham act has taught them to overestimate Concerning the failure of the Wyndham act to accomplish what was intended the editor says Two extraordinary facts strike one from a retrospect of the work ing of Wyndhnms act for the past five years One is the huge differ ence between Wyndhams estimate of the amount required to transfer the land of Ireland to the tenants the other Is the utter collapse in practice of his financial arrange ments Wyndham assumed that the purchase price of the entire land of Ireland would nh t exceed one hun y tfrjri tRltliamrmr fo sshiih he added ITu nri inducement or bribe to the land I lords the large bonus of twelve mill ions sterling Now in actual fact thirty millions have been raised and paid over to landlords sales repre senting fiftytwo millions have been arranged and are awaiting only the provision of the money and Secretary iBlrrell is assured that 100 millions more will be required to finance the transfer of these estates < for the sale of which no agreements have been arrived at raising the total price of Irish land to the ex traordinary sum of 180 millions not including the bonus Uyndhnm es timated in arranging the financial basis of his net that his 2 per cent land stock would be subscribed for at par and that there would be no loss on the flotation but it has been found that the average cash price of the stock has been about 88 It has been as low as b4 The total loss of issuing the thirty millions of stock already subscribed for has amounted to three and n half mill ions and it the Treasury were to go on with the issue of this stock to + finance the entire transaction of land purchase in Ireland there would be a loss of not less than twenty millions This would repre sent an annual charge of something dangerously hear a million sterling which under Wyndhams act would have to be borne by the ratepayers resultt t would be that the tenants would pay a high price for their land the land lords would receive a sum startlingly startlinglydisproportionate disproportionate to what Wyndham assumed they would be entitled to and the taxpayers o Ireland would have to endure a charge which might well prove tho last straw completing the countryThe The new bill proposes to issue stock at 3 per cent instead of 2 per cent to finance future transac tions For those which have been up to the present arranged and which await the money amounting as al ready stated to over fifty millions sterling the landlords will be of fered 2 per cent stock nt 92 br part cash and part stock at that + price and the loss which will be In volved in issuing the balance of the fiftytwo millions required to com plete these transactions is to be exchequerThus Thus the ratepayers of Ireland will be saved the heavy impost that would have been placed on them had this sum been raised by the issue of c stock at the present market prices under the provisions of Wyndhams act As regards the future trans actions while the purchasing tenant will have to pay an annuity of 314 r per cent instead of 311 per cent it will be his business to see that he buys his land at a lower figure hisou neighbor who has bought under the < Wyndham act gave that Is to say that the annuity at the new rate of 314 per cent on the purchase prlei shall be no greater than that of his neighbor who will lid paying only 34 per cent on the purchase price IB other words the landlord will h4ve to lake a lean Dumber of years I purchase for hl ili estate F rthpI I Jmo lie wU have to most eases tj accept smaller bonuses ThlsJ f what the landlord warned over aDd Oy tlclpate The bonus proposed by Wyndham was accepted with rev luctance by the Liberals who indeed had no power at the time to give ef fect to such objections It required I no gift of prophecy atne foretell that when the Liberals come Into power these questions would bo brought under review at the termination Pf the five years period wlilch ended on the first of this month and the wiser among tho landlords showed their appreciation of this fact by rushing in on the last day or two of October to make agreements for sole and secure the bonus under the i old system I J

Works Wants Government to Set Example For Other Employers to Follow OPPOSED TO CHILD LALOR President Roosevelt sent his last message to the United States Con gress on Tuesday and although a wealthy man from birth he shows his feeling for the mechanic and laborer wno have to work hard for a days wages Among the many sub jects touched upon in this final mss sage of the President none is more vigorously handled than that which deals with the dangers to working men and the liability of employers The nations Chief executive says there slrould be no faltering with the question of caring for the wage workers and urges immediate action partOur Our present system or rather no system works dreadful wrong and is of benefit to only one class of peo lethe lawyers When a workman is is injured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit but the certainty of relief through imme diate administrative action The num ber of accidents which result in the death or crippling of wapeworkcrs In the Union at large is simply ap palling In a very few years It runs up a total far in excess of the aggre gate of the dead and wounded in any modern war No academic theory about freedom of contract or constitutional liberty to contract should be permitted to interfere with this and similar movements Progress in civilization has every where meant a limitation and reg ulation of contract T call your es pecial attention to the bulletin of the Bureau of Labor which gives a statement of the methods of treating treatingthe the unemployed in European coun tries as this is a subject which in German for Instance js treated in conndo4lliin I WltlminaltimuFks 11 roisl lin for worn out ami crippled workmen Pending a thoroughgoing Investi gation and action there is certain legislation which should be enacted at once The law passed at the last session of the Congress granting compensation to certain classes of employes of the Government should be extended to Include all employes of the Government and should bo made more liberal in its terms There is no good ground for the dis tinction made in the law between those engaged in hazardous occupa occupations tions and those not so engaged If a man is injured or killed In any line of work it was hazardous in his case WfleYlier 1 per cent or 10 per cent of those following a sriven oc cupation actually suffer injury or death ought not to have any bearing on the question of their receiving compensationIt It Is a grim logic which says to an injured employe or to the dependents of one killed that he or they are en titled to no compensation because few people other than he have been Injured or killed in that occupation Perhaps one of the most striking omissions in the law is that it docs not embrace peace officers and oth ers whose lives may be sacrificed in enforcing the laws of the United States The terms of the act provid ing compensation should be made more liberal than in the present act A years compensation is not ade quate for a wageearncrs family in the event of his death by accident emplomentAnd And in the event of death occurring say ten or eleven months after the accident the family would only row celve as compensation the equivalent of one or two months earnings In this respect the generosity of the United States toward its employes compares most unfavorably with that of every country in Europe even the poorest The terms of the act are also ti hardship in prohibiting pa ment in cases whore the accident is in any way due to the negligence of the employe It Is inevitable that daily familiarity with danger will lead men to take chances that can be con strued Into negligence So well 11 1 this recognized that in practically all countries in the civilized world except the United States only a great degree of negligence acts as a bar to securing compensation Prob ably in no other respect is our legis lation both State and national so far behlpd practically the entire civ ilized world as in the matter of lia bility and compensation for ned dents in industry It is humiliating that at European international con gresses on accidents the United States should be singled out as the most belated among the nations in respect to employers liability legls latin This Government is itself n IsJtlliM large employer of labor anti in Its dealings with its employes it should get a standard in this country which would place it on a par with the most progressive countries in Eur opt The laws of the United States in this respect and the laws of European countries have been sum marized in a recent bulletin of the Bureau of Labor ROIl no American who > reads this summary can fail to be struck by the great contra t be tween our practice and tbelrlla contrast not 1 k any sense to our credit J President R seveltfi also 3e rei the United States Government to set other employ Ill of labor l a good lex M i aai e z half holiday during the summer r mouths and likewise advocates an extension of the sighthour system to all Government departments He further favors such legislation as will minimize child and woman labor in factories and mills
