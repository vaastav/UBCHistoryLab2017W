A t-arefully coutlensitl syuopsis is as follows: The constitutional duty ihu h reuirt'S the president from time to tmu to gixv to the congress information of tin- suite of the union and reeoiumt ud to their con sideration such measures as he shall judge tuvessary and expedient is tittinly i ti tt rrd upm by commenting to the congress a careful examination of the detailed staremeuts and suppirtt-d recoiuiuenda tions contained in the reports of the heads of the departments, who are chieily charged with the executive work of the government. Speaking of our foreign relations the message says that while they have not at ill tunes during the pat year been free from perplexity, no embarrassing situation remains at the present time. Regarding the Brazilian situation the president ays that he fails to see that the rebels in that country can claim recogni tion from the Vnited States and that thus far the position of our government has been that of an attentive, but impartial observer of the unfortunate eontlict. The action of the late Commander Stanton of the South American squadron of the I nited States navy is disavowed in a man ner not to be misunderstood. The relations of our government with Chili are briefly referred to and the presi dent states affairs with th:it republic are now in a satUfactoiy state. The tleary act, providing fr the exclu sion and deportation of Chinese, who un lawfully take up residence in this country, also receives brief recognition from th 1'ivsideut. but he m:ikts no recomim uda tions concerning the matter. Our relation with France, iit-rm.im and ilreat 1 itaiu and all Kuropeau countries are reported intimate and cordial. Speak ing of the seizure of an American vessel by insurgents in Honduras the president states the belief that a satisfactory adjust ment will be reached without anv further trouble. The president cougratul.it s the country upon the friendly r-lations exi-ting be tween our goernmetit and the republics o: Mi xico and i'eiitral America. Important matters hae demanded at tntion in our relations with the Ottoman l'orte. The tiring and partial destruction by an unrestrained mob of one of th school buildings of Anatolia college, estab lished by citizens of the Vniud States at Marsan. and the apparent indifference of the Turkish government to act, called for earnest remonstrance which was followed by promises of reparation and punishment of the offenders. Soon after full indem nity for the outrage was paid our govern ment. "i u i;t;.iri'N- with iiawah. It i- hardly iuves-ary." says the presi dent, "for me to state that the (piestion ai ising from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the installation of the present ad ministration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown, and a tratv of annexation had been nego tiated between the provisional government j of the islands and the Vnited States, and ; submitted to the senate foi ratification. ! This treaty 1 withdrew for examination, j and dispatched Hon James H. lount of : Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commis- ) sioner to make an impartial investigation : of the circumstances attending the change , of government and of all the conditions j bearing upon the subject of the treaty. ! After a thorough and exhaustive examina- , tiou, Mr lllount submitted to me his re port, showing beyond all question that the ; constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government, and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of th . t nitcd States, which was landed foi that j purpose at the instance of our minister. I'poU the facts developed it seemed to Hie the only honorable course for our go ern- , ment to pursue was to undo the wrong that ' hail been done by those representing us and to restore, as far as pi acticable. th status existing at the time of our forcible interx eiitiou. With a iew of accomplish- ing tliis result withm the constitutions! limits of exeeutie power, and recognizing all our obligations and i spotlsibiliti s growing out of changed conditions brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instructions to that nd. Tints far no information of the accomplishment of any definite results has lu en received from h:m. Additional advices are so, n txpected. When received they will be promptly sent to congress, together with all other information at hand, accompanied , bv a special executive message fully.de tailing all the facts necessary to j. complete understanding of the case, and present! n:; a history of all the material events leading to the present situation." He refers to the recast m the consular service, and the ex tending of the copyright laws. 

NATIONAL VINANcKs. The president reviews the reort of secretary of treasury and says: "It is esti mated uion the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 'MK 'M, will be t:o, 121 .'.too. :is, and its expenditures -si V-. 121. ;t"'5.:ts resulting in a deficiency of ss.tHiO,(Nt4!. tin the first day of Novem ber is;i;t, the amount of money of all kinds i in circulation, or not including in treasury i holdings, was ?1.71S.544,t-s-2 an increase ifortheyenr of $11 2.44,'47.

On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to ?.!, i'm", "27 : and silver bullion which was purchased ut a cost of l2ti,-2t;i,r.:i. The purchases of silver tinder the law of July 11, IS'. it during the last fiscal year aggregated .i4,His.lti2.r fine ounces which cost $4"", ";!, 374. :!. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause on the first day of November ISM was ir.S,074.rj'.Ml.4i fine ounces, which cost $l-",5,'t:tO,''40.s4." He refers to the national bank failure-? and states that the recent silver repeal has made nn entire change in our currency affairs and says that the act ion will be Jmost salutary aud far reach ing. In the nature of things, however. ! it is iuiiossible to know at this time, precisely what condi tions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any. supplementary legislation niay. in the light of such conditions, ap pear to be essential or expedient. Of course, after the recent financial pertnrla tion, time is necessary for the re-establishment of business confidence. When, how ever, throngh this restored confidence the money which has been frightened into hoarding place is returned to trade aud enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to ft permanently sound currency, abuntlantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increasing population and business. In the pursuit of this object we should reso lutely turn away from alluring, and tempo rary expedients, determined to be con tented with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with thia sub ject, instead of being injnrions, will in cream the probability of wise action. I desire- also to traggesi the wisdom of amending the existing statutes in regard to the issuance of government bonds. The authority now vested in the secretary of treasury is not as clear as it should be, and the bonds authorized are disadvanta geous to the government, both as to the time of their maturity and rate of interest." Till 

TENSION LIST. lleferring to the question of pensions the message states that on the 30th day of June, ls3 there were on the pension rolls IHttf.Old names; an increase ofSVl,ll4 over the number on the rolls June 30. is:2. Of these there were seventeen widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, eighty-six survivors of tho war of lsVJ, 5,42" widows of soldiers of the war, '21, o IS survivors and w idows of the Mexican war, 3,2 survivors and. widows of Indian wars, "jsj army nurses, and 475,t45 survi vors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the war of the re bellion. The latter number represents these pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from hi my and navy service. The number of persous remaining on the rolls June 30. ls:3, who were pen sioned under the act of June '27, ivm, which allows pensions on account of death and disability not chargeable to army ser vice was i-VM-Vj. The number added to the rolls during the year was l'23.t'.31 and the number dropped was 33, 'lint. The first payments on pensions allowed during the year amounted to S3J.7 bl,.M',,.,.,s. The discovery having been made that many names bad been put upon the pension rolls by means of wholesale anil gigantic frauds, the commissioner suspended pay ments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized, pending acomplete examination. giving note to the pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to establish if possible the justice of their claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity. 1 am unable to un derstand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and correct! d with thoroughness and vigor. Kv ry name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a ' wicked imposition upon the kindly sonti- 1 nieut in which pensions have their origin: j every fraudulent pensioner has become a j bad citizen; eveiy false oath iu sttport j of a pension has made perjury more com- . mon, and false and underscrving pension- rs rob the people not only of their money. but of patriotic sentiment w hich the sur vivors of a war. fought for the preserva- tion of the union, ought to inspire. 1 Thousands of neighborhoods have their 1 well known fraudulent pensioners, and re- ; cent developments by the bureau establish ! appalling conspiracies to accomplish pen- ! sion frauds, lly no means the hast wrong : done is to brave and deserving pensioners, 1 who certainly ought not to be condemned to ' such association. Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should not be accused of enmity or of in-dirTereii.-e to the claims of honest . tenuis. t;ik u;my, naw, i:t . The president suggests a iv-orgauizatiou of the army, strengthening it, kand the : massing of troops aud abandonment of small posts, and is gratifitd at schemes for seacoast fortifications. He urges congress to provide for the purchase of heavy ord nance and states another year will find our army supplied with a weapon equal to that of any in the world. He advocates a change in enforcing the federal criminal law, recommends legisla tion fixing degrees of the crime of murder within federal jurisdiction and speedy pro vision for the construction of prisons for I nited States convicts. Ow ing to the depression free postal de livery should not be extended to small communities. and he adds that it is the rail way mail service which is the especial in strument which adds to the promptness of all mail dt livery and places small offices on equality w ith large on s. He touches upon the new nay. and the ' vessels in process of construction, and siys: -While lam ditinctly in favor . f consistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated, of building up a thorough and efficient navy. I cannot refrain from the suggestion that the congress should care fully take into account the number of un finished vessels on our hands, and the de pleted condition of our treasury in con sidering the propriety of an appropria tion at this time to begin new woik." Referring to the Indian situation he savs; 1 am sure that secular education and moral and ri ligious teaching must be im portant factors in any effort to save the Indian and lead him to civilization. 1 be lieve too that the relinquishment of tribal relations and the holding of laud in sever alty may in favorable conditions aid this consummation. The solution of the Indian problem ib pi nds very largely upon good administration." The continued intelligent execution of the ci-.il s, wice law and the increasing ap proval by the people of its operation are most gratifying. The recent extension of its limitations and regulations to the em ploy t at trie delivery postoflices. which lias be u holi stiy ami promptly .I' Com plislu l by the commission, with t he hi arty co-operation of the jtostmasti-r gen end, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system. I am. it lossible, mot than ever coinim-id of the incalculable benefits conferred by tlu iiil J service law, not only in it$ etuct upon the public service, but also, what "is ieu more important, in its effect in ehv.iting ' the ton of political life gen, rail v. i He adds; - At this time when a depleted j public treasury confronts us, when maiiv i of our people are engaged in a h.ird strug gle tor the necessaries of life aud when enforced economy is pressing upon the great mass of our countrymen, I desire to! urge with all the earmstness at my com-! maud that congressional legislation be so limited by strict economy so as to exhibit an appreciation of the condition of the treasury and a sympathy with the stmight ened circumstances of our fellow citizens. The duty of public economy is also ot im mense importance in its intimate aud necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditures and yet reducing the people s burden of federal taxation." TUK TAIiiri . After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so important claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duty; an opportunity to preserve the gratitude of our fellow citizens and a duty imposed upon us by our oft repeated pro fessions and by the emphatic mandate of the people. After full discussion our countrymen have sjtoken in favor of this reform aud they have confided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is an thing in the theory of a representa tion in public places of the people and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the people and if political promises and professions have any bind ing force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Noth ing should intervene to distract our atten tion or disturb our effort until this reforu. is accomplished by wise and careful legis lation. While we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the iuqtosition of tariff duties and other federal taxation and that they should be limited by strict economy, we can not close our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among us, which in justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergen cies of our government actually demand. Mamifestly if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform one of its uiosX obvious features should be a reduc tion in the present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpable and sub stantial, seeu and felt by thousands, who wotiM be better fed and bt(er clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the willing benefactions of a government, whose highest functions is the promotion of the welfare of the people. "Not less closely related to onr people" prosperity and welt Wing is the removal of restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials necessary to our manufac tures. The world should bo open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while federal legislation, through the importation of high tariff, forbids to American manufacturers as cheap materials as those used by their com jh-u tors, it is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our uianufactered products re sulting from this policy not only confines the market for this product within our own borders, to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, vbutTalso increases their cost to our citizens. 'The interests of labor are certainly, though indirectly, involved in this feature ! of our tariff, system. The sharp compe- j tition and active struggle among our manu- 1 facturers to supply the limited demand for their goods, soon tills the narrow market to 1 which they are confined. Then follows a j suspension of work in mills and factories, ! a discharge of employes, and distress in the homes of our workingtuen. Kv,n , if the often disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rat of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the intelligence of our workingmen leads them quickly to dis cover that their steady employment, per mitted by free raw materials, is the most important factor in their relation to the ' tariff legislation. A measure has been pre im red by the appropriate congressional committee, em bodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly sub mitted for legislative action. It is the re sult of much patriotic and unselfish wotk and 1 believe it deals with its subject con sistently and as thoroughly as existing con ditions permit. I am satisfied thai the reduced tariff duties provided for in the promised legislation, added to existing inter nal re enue taxation, will iu th near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government. The committee, alter full consideration and to provide against a teui Mniry deficiency that may exist before the ; business of thecuuitry adjusts itself to ' the new tariff schedules, have wisely em- : bnieed in their plan a few additional in ternal revenue taxes, including a small tax , upon incomes derived from cei tain cor porate investments. 1 These new assessments are not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as ' can be remitted without unfavorable business dis urbaucc whcneMr the m ces- i sity for their imposition no lougtr exists. ! In my great desire for th success of this measure, I cannot restrain the suggestion ; that its success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a result of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitions to the general good. The local interests affected by the pro posed reform are so numerous and so aried. that if all are insisted upon the h gislation embodving th1 reform must in imitably fail. - 1 n conclusion my intense feeling ef responsibility impels me to invoke for the mauit'old interests of a generous and con fiding people th- most scrupulous car and to pledge my willing support to cery legis lative effort for the advancement of great- ' ncss and prosperity of our b lov d country. t ii:ov kk Ci KV ki.

"Sti far from attaching undue impor tance to it, I was fully aware that the con tribution meant tar less, to mo than the time and elloit devoted by ihouauds of uustlfish litixcus to the s,itne camimign. Nor ditl I believe that it should entitle me to any mere consideration. On the con trary, I have not only admitted, but have positively insisted at all times, that it created no obligation to u:e whatever, and I feel confident that the president, who in fact was kind enough to say to the Demo crats of Rhode Islam! that his personal ac quaintance with me enabled him to eou bider my candidacy solely upon its merits, will Irear me out in this assertion. "On the other hand, I frankly admit that until after the appointment had been made it never once occurred to my mind that my contribution could le used to my injttrv. 1 may add that, although I have endeavored to study w ithout bias the ar guments which have Ireeii advanced, 1 can not even now perceive that it is any less creditable or patriotic for one to aid with his menus a cause in which he believes than with his voice or pen. "Uut whatever may t the correct con clusion regarding the ethics of the case, the fact remains that a large number of my fellow citizens have Iteeu led, either by co incidence of circumstauces or by false re port, to look upon my appointment as in some w ay inconsistent with the professions of the Democratic party and the president's high ideals of public service. Hy these critics generally my fitness for the rosition has leen general ly conceded, but the fact of my contribution to the campaign fund has been considered as making it improper for me to receive this appointment. 1 do not think that 1 could now remove thisini. pressiou from the minds of many right mind.-.! and thoughtful people, w ho-e judg ment. I frankly admit, may possibly be correct. "At nil events, it i- elc.tr that 1 find my self iu a lalse po-iiiou with reference to this ontce and appoiutmeut. Acceptance of the office would make me appear w illing for the sake of icrsotml gratification to discredit in the mindsof many the political party to which I am attached, and to bring undeserved rebuke upon the administra tion which has honored me and wluw suc cess I earnestly desire.

The sentimeuts contained In your letter do credit to your conscience and Americanism, but you must allow me to dissent from their application in this ease. 4I did not select you for nomination for the Italian mission without satisfying my aelf of your entire fitness fur the place. I am now better convinced of your tttneas than ever. You kuow aud 1 know that all the maliguaut criticism that has been in dulged iu regarding this appointiveut has no justification, and that the decent people who have doubted its propriety have been misled or have missed the actual considera tions upon which it rests.
