THE law of New Hampshire requires thu makers of oleomargarin« to color it pink ao that it cannot by any possibility be mistaken for butter.

There is nothing unbecoming abont an ex-president's return to old pnrsnits on the contrary, it is highly be coming under democratic institutions that he should do so. But the Tribune's advice is cot very bad. The farm will do for ex-presidents if they have money en ough to buy one, and can extract com fort therefrom.

C.—Lord Sackville and his daughters and Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain left for New York on the 11 o'clock traiu toda}, and tomorrow will sail for France iu the steamer La Bjur gogne.

THE oommipaiGU appointed to treat with the Southern UteB, for their removal from the new reservation, completed their labor at the ageuuy by giving the Indians a barbecue dinner. The treaty will BOW be submitted to a of congress of the republicans and patient resigna tion on the part of the democrats being everywhere evident. The republican members who are prominently mentioned in connection with the speakership of the 51«f. congress, came in for an extra share of felicitations, it being generally conceded ou the floor that the next house will be republican with from to 7 ma jority. At precisely 12 o'clock the fall of .he gavel settled the tumult whioh ex isted in the hall, and silence reigned, while Dr. Milburti, the chaplaii, offered prajer. The rcll of members was then called, and the hum of conversation broke out afresh. Daring the progress of the call Mr. Cleveland entered the executive gallery and became an attractive specta tor. Th* call developed th« presence of .'136 member*, there being 88 absentees. Oa motion of Air. .Mills (Texas,) a reso lution was adopted directing the clerk to inform the senate tha a quorum of the house had nppeared, and that th» house wa-t ready to prcoeed to bn-iiness. In accordance with the resolnli«'n the speaker appointed Messrs. Holman (Ind.), Turner (G.*.), and O'Neill (Pn.) as a com mittee to join a similar committee to wait upon the president and inform him that congress was ready to receive any communication that ho might desire to transmit. The house then, at 12::H, took a reoess for an hour. After tne recess Mr. Holman announced that the com mittee appointed to wait upon the presi dent had performed its duty, aud that the president would commuuioate with con gress forthwith. The president's anuusl message was then read by the clerk. The portion of th» message in which the president treats of the tariff question was listened to attentively by the members oa both sidea of the house. Now ao.d e n a s i e o e o i u a n o derision would appear on the face of an enthusiastic republican, tut thw sileuce was not broken until the olerk rend, "the cause for whioh the battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly and dis tinctly defined. It should never be compromised. It is the people's cause.'' Then the democrats could no longer re tain their feelings and broke into around of applause, which was answered by tho republicans with derisive laughter. The president's reference to the Saokville West incident provoked laughter from the republican side of the bouse, but no demonstration was made by the demo crats. From this point interest in the message slackened. Mr. Mills was the only member who paid the slightest a', tention to its further reading, and the noise of conversation was so ent that this was no easy tank. When, at .1:15 p. m., the reading was completed, Mr. Mills offered a resolution, whioh was agreed to, referring the message to the committee of the whole nud providing for its print ing. Adjourned. Senate.—It was an unuiur.lly full sen* ate that responded to President Ingall's call to order at 12 o'clock to-day. At that time the public galleries were crowd ed.

CONGRESSIONAL- MONDAY, Deo. ". House.—Long before the hoar for the meeting of the seoond session of the 50th congress the g-illeries of the house were fillec with spectators, and the bright dress es of the ladies formed a brilliant frame lo the picture presented on the floor below. There hand shaking was indulged in and congratulations on re-election or condol ences in defeat were exchanged among the members, jocose raillery on the part Stone the sei ate to order, and Chaplain Butler opened the proceed ings with prayer. He returned hanks for the bountiful blessings tonohsaved the land in its uaterial interest#, and remembered Presi dent-elect Harrison in his petition. A few minntes were spent in greeting senators, and then Senator Sherman of fered the usual resolutions, that the seo retary notify the house that the senate is ready to proceed to business. A reoolu tion was offered by Sen. Morrill for the nppointment of a committee to notify the president tha' the secate is roady to re ceive any communication he may have to ike. Sena'ors Morrill and Salisbury composed this committee. Sen. Cameron offered a resolution that the senate meet each day until further ordered at 12 o'clock, which resolution was adopted. At 12:47 on motion of Mr. Sherman, the senate took a leoess for half an hour. At the conclusion of the reoess, whioh had been exunded to 1:30, the u*ual message from the house, announcing the facts uf it* bting in session and of its aaving appointed a committee to wait up on th* president was delivered. That was followed by a report from the committee to wait on the president to ths effect that it had performed iha duty and that the president would communicate in writing immediately. The president's message was then delivered, and Mr. McCook, s*o retary of the senate, proceeded to read it. The reading of the message ocoapied an hour and twenty minutes. The por tions of it which discussed the question of tariff revision, treasury surplss, fishery troubles and the West incideut were listened to with very olose attention by the fourteen republican senators and abont an equal number of democrats. Tte other portions of the message seemed to have but- few, if any listeners, and thu reading had the effect of gradually clearings the gslleries of the nomuroni spectators. When the reading was finish ed, the message was laid on the ta-le and ordered to bo printed. The presiding oftioer announced that the unfinished business for tomorrow was the bill to re duce taxation (the tariff bill.) Hen. Frye gave notice that he would call up for con nidtration to morrow morning, tho bill for settlements with the Union Pacific railroad company, nnd the bill was made a special order for tomorrow. The sen ate then adjourned, after notification by Sen. Frye that h^ would call up the Union Pacific suttlement bill to-morrow by Sen.
