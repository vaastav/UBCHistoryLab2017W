TIU1WTC TO LAUUlt, Tho American Federation of Labor throiiRh Its nntlonnl convention 1ms ex tended n votu of thnnks to President Hoosovelt for his reconimendntlon em bodied In his message to congress urg ing the early re-ouuctnient of the Chi nese exclusion act. lit view of tho In tense Interest manifested by American worklngmeu lu the continued exclusion of Chinese lunnlcratits. this token of.i appreciation of tho stand taken In be half of American labor by President Hoosovelt was but natural. , It Is passing strange, however, that this greatest representative body of skilled mechanics should linve seem ingly Ignored tho splendid tribute which tho president has paid to American worklngmeu and the courageous plea on their behalf for the concession of every rational demand mndo by organ ized labor. No other' president has been so outspoken In discussing the rights and wrongs of wage-workers nnd no other president has ever ventured to champion tho cause of the tollers lu mine, mill or factory. First nnd foremost President Roose velt's message takes positive ground In the right of worklugmcn to organize for mutual protection and the promo tion of their mutual welfare. Recog nizing the difference between the stand ards of living of American and foreign worklngmeu, tho president Insists that "evory effort of legislator nnd adminis trator should be bent to secure the per manency of the present prosperous con ditions. Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but It should also be protected as far as possible from tho presence In this country of any laborers brought over by contract." The president, however, does not stop with this declaration against contract labor, but also couples his recommen dation with the demand thnt the pro ducts of convict labor bo as far as possible excluded from competition with tho products of free labor through congressional legislation. For many years organized labor has endeavored to bring about n uniform eight-hour working day, but up to this time congress has gone only so far as to establish tho eight-hour day for men and women on the payroll of the gov ernment Repeated efforts to lnduco former presidents to recommend the ex- f0,,H,, f n. ,.ll.f.i... ..,i, ,i.. in ntniilnvnu tf (nntpnritnitt it. 1.11.. works had been unsuccessful. The ac tion of President Roosevelt in incorpo rating Into his message a recommenda tion for such legislation entitles him to the gratitude not only of members of trades uulous represented lu the Fed oration of Labor, but also of working men of every class. Tho concluding portion of the mcs sago relating to tho lnbor problem should Impress Itself Indelibly upon tho mind of every brcndwlnuer In America American wago-workers work with their heads as well as tbclr hands. Moreover. they tako a keen prldo la what they uro doing; bo that, Independent of tho reward, thoy wish to turn out a perfect Job. This is tue great secret of our success In com' petition with tho labor of foreign countries, Tho most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the wholo civilized world, boa to deal, is the problem which has for ono sido the betterment of social conditions, moral and physical, In largo cities, and for another sldo tho effort to deal with that tangle of far-reaching questions which wo group together when wo speak of "labor." Tho chief factor In tho success of each man wage-worker, farmer und capitalist alike must ever ibo tho sura total of his own Individual quali ties and abilities, Second only to this comes tho power of acting in combination or association with others. Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage-workers, when mauaged with forethought, and when they combine Insistence upon their own rights with law-abiding respect for tha rights of others. Tho display of tlicso qualities In such bodies Is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves. Finally, there must also in many cases bo action by tho government In order to safeguard tho rights and Interests of all. Under our constitution thero Is much mora scopo for such action by tho state and tho municipality than by the na tion. Hut on points such as thoso touched on above tuo national government can act when all is said and done, the rulo of brotherhood remains as tho Indlspensablo prerequisite to success In tho kind of na tional life tor which wo strive. Each roan must work for himself, and unless he so works no outsldo help can avail hlra; but each man must romembcr also that bo Is Indeed his brother's keeper, and that whllo no man who refuses to walk can be carried with ndvantngo to himself or anyone clso, yet that each at times stumbles or halts that each at times needs to havo tho help Ing hand outstretched to him. To be permanently effective aid must always tako tho form of helping a man to holp himself. and wo can all best help ourselves by Joining together In the work that Is of common Interest to all 

VOIWSTS AND UilllUATlON. In his annual report the secretary of tho Interior said that water conservation cannot bo successfully maintained with' out a thorough system of forest protec tlou and he urged that to give to tho people of tho west tho full beneilts which tho forest reserves arc capable of yielding two things nro necessary Tho demand for more reserves should be met by the careful extension of tho reserved area In accordance with tho results of careful study ou the grouud and thero should bo n thoroughly prac tlcal and cfllclent administration of the reserves und tho resources they contain, Tho secretary expressed tho oplulon that the time for tho Introduction of practical forestry on tho forest reserves has fully como and said: "Tho utility of tho reserves to tho agricultural, uiln lug, grazing ami lumber Interests of tho regions lu which they llo Is so great, so generally recognized and so rapidly ou tho Increase, that to give them any form of management but tho best available Is a most serious blow to the prosperity of tho west." this matter received lu tno president s message tho attention which Its linpor tuuco merits, being more thoroughly con is hie red than In the report of the secrc tnry of tho Ulterior. Tho president said that forest protection Is not an end o Itself; It Is a menus to Increase nud sus tain tho resources of our country and tho Industries which depend upon them "Tho preservation of our forests Is an Imperative business necessity. Wo hay como to see clearly that whatever de stroys the forest, except to make way for agriculture, threatens our well-being." He said that the forests are nnt- ural reservoirs. Hy restraining the streams lu Hood and replenishing them In drouth they make possible the tine of waters otherwise wasted. "Forest con servation Is therefore an essential con dition of water conservation." In the pinion of tho president the forest re serves should be set apart forever for tho use and benefit of our people ns a Whole and not sacrificed to the short sighted greed of a few. He further urged that wise forest protection does not menu the withdrawal of forest re sources, whether of wood, water or grass, from contributing their full share to tho welfare of the people, but, on the contrary, gives the assurance of lurger and more certain supplies. This auestlou of the conservation of the forests, as everybody Is aware who has given Intelligent attention to the subject, has a direct relation to the question of Irrigation and it Is therefore most essential that congress shall pro- lde whatever additional legislation may bo necessary to the udemmto pro tection of tho forests and to the carrying on of tho work of reforestation. Tho recommendations of the president and f tho secretary of the Interior lu regard to this should receive tho careful and earnest attention of congress and they will doubtless be urged by the advo cates of Irrigation. Thero being mani festly need of n more thorough policy espectlng the protection and preserva tion of the forests on the public lands no sound reason can bu found for delay ing to provide for this. 

HESVOXSWLE OOVEHA'MEXT F1UST. Whatever congress shnll finally de termine to do In the matter of granting tnrlff concessions to Gubn, It seems a perfectly sound contention that noth ing lu tho way of u reciprocity arrange ment cau be entered Into until Cuba has n responsible government, capable of making treaties. This view Is held by members of congress who are not .unfavorable to making concessions on Cuban products, but who are unwilling that anything of this kind shall be done until an agreement or treaty cau bo negotiated that will give something In return for such concessions, which there Is no authority In the Island for doing at present. Secretnry Root, In urging prompt ac tion by congress, Implied a belief that It Is not necessary to wait until a gov ernment Is established In Cuba, that congress has full authority to reduce or remove tariff duties ou Cuban sugar nnu tobacco at once, it this be ndmltted, yet on the Bcoro of expediency and in order to ob vlato possible dllUeulty lu the future It seems to us to bo wise to allow exist ing conditions to remain until Cuba has government that can negotiate re garding commercial relations. Very likely delay will cause some loss to the Cuban planters, but It is a matter of so much Importance to American Inter ests that it should be treated with de liberation and properly determined. PHILIPPINE PHOULEMS. Tho report of General Chaffee on conditions lu tho Philippines cor roborates what has been said by other military olllccrs regarding tho unreli able and treacherous character of the natives, to which Is largely duo tho prolongation of tho guerrilla warfare. 11 who havo visited the lskuids aud ifiado careful Investigation agreo lu saying that no dependence can be placed upon tho professions of friend ship for Amerlcnus on the part of Fili pinos generally, though doubtless some of them are sincere. Tho largo ma Jorlty of them, It seoins, have no con ception of Amerlcau principles, which Is not at all surprising In view of the political system under which they liavo always lived, while very gen erally they regard the humane meth ods of American administration us an evidence of weakness. President Roosevelt said lu his mes sago that lu our anxiety for tho wel fare aud progress of the Philippines "It may bo that here and there we have gouo too rapidly lu giving them local self-government It Is on this side that our error, if any, has been com mltted. No competent observer, sin cerely desirous of lludlug oht the facts and Intluenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives, cau assert that wo have not gouo far enough. Wo havo gono to the very verge of safety In hastening tho process. To have taken a slugle step further or faster in advance would havo been folly aud weakness, aud might ,well havo beeu crime." Thero Is reason to think that tho advance In this respect has been too rapid. Tho Judge advocate geuernl of tho urmy In tho Philippines says tho suppression of brlguuduge will most probably bo ouo of tho tryln problems of tho future, adding that If tho military arm were left to deal with tho marauders thero would be no doubt of their Until suppression, "but tho Incoming of civil government com pllcutcs tho situation very consider ably." This is doubtless a much more moderato und conservative statement of tho matter than would have beeu made were not military olllccrs under con stralnt to observe moderation In tho expressions of their opinions. Perhaps tho situation In tho Philip pines has somewhat Improved since these reports were written, but It Is a fnct that complete paclllcatlou seems to be still remote and before It Is nc compllshcd somo decided changes lu policy may bo necessary. Representn tlvo Cooper of Wisconsin, chairman of tho house committee on Insular affairs lu tho last congress and who will prob ably bo reappointed to that position, Is of tho opinion that tho controversy be tween tho ecclesiastical orders and the natives Is at tho seat of all tho trou bles between the United States and tho Filipinos and that If tho friars can bo eliminated from tho situation peuc and submission to tho authority of th United states will speedily follow, lie approves tho suggestion of Secretary Root that tho government should buy tho property, of the friars und bell It to settlers. Another thing urged Is a general frnuchlse law which will pro mote the Industrial development of the Islands. Tho Philippine problem still presents grave dllllcultles and there Is an urgent demand upon congress to meet them. Meanwhile It Is manifestly necessary to maintain the strength of the military force now lu the uchlpelago. , THE COXSVLAll 

SEHVWE. The lnfltlenco of the administration will be exerted lu behalf of legislation looklug to tho Improvement of the con sular service. This Is plainly .Indicated in tho reference to the subject lu the president's message. While ackuowl- dglng that the service at present Is etllciont, the president rightly says that a standard of excellence cannot bo permanently mnlntnlncd until the prlu- iiiles set forth lu the bills heretofore submitted to congress on the subject are enacted into law. Theso ineusures propose to eliminate politics from tho consular service aud to place tlte serv- co on a basis of merit, which every body will ndmlt Is the only proper basis. Tho president points out tho great lmportauco of tho consular serv ice In connection with our foreign commerce und therefore the neces sity of having lu tho service men of haractcr, knowledge and enterprise. Doubtless a majority of our cousuls meet this requirement There are among them men of ,llno ability, who faithfully perforin their duties. Some of them havo been long In the service nud arc thoroughly familiar with Its equlrenients. Thero are others, how- over, who are uelther capable nor faith ful ineu, who could not.have gotten Into tho service If a practical tost of iltuess hud been applied. Of course such men are not only useless, but do tho coun try uu Injury und bring reproach upon tho wholo service. It (ls hardly possi ble to prevent men of this kind secur ing consular positions under existing conditions aud congress should apply the remedy by making appointments to tho consular service depend upon Iltuess. 

WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PHACTWE. Tho best test of tho arguments ad vanced In support of and against woman suffrage Is naturally to be found In tho actual results of practical ex periment. Whllo the suffrage has been extended to woman in a number of the western states, Colorado, with Its varie gated population living in cities, mining camps and ranches, presents conditions that enable the student of political sci ence to formulate a rational estimate. What seems to bo nn entirely Impar tial and disinterested survey of the prog ress and achievements of woman suf frage has been contributed to the cur rent nnnnls of tho Amerlcnan Academy of Political nud Social Sclenco by Prof. E. Le Rosslgnol of the University of Denver, in which lie reviews briefly the history of tho movement up to tho con summation of Its purpose In 1S94 nud gives the women credit for some re forms accomplished wholly or lu part through woman's lulluence. Ho hesi tates to form an estimate ns to the value of woman suffrage to Colorado "because of tho diversity of opinion on tho sub ject and because It Is not yet possible to prove either the success or failure of tho system from the polut of view of social expediency." Tho most interesting part of tho paper, however, Is the conclusions as to Its effect renched by tho writer and expressed as follows: People who expected that socloty would bo utterly and immediately regenerated through tho lnlluenco of woman suffrage havo been grievously disappointed and many of them, both men aud women, con sider tho experiment a total falluro and would bo glad to see tho old system re stored. Woman suffrage has not purified politics to any great extent. Corrupt prac tices aro as common In Colorado as In any other state, nnd it Is a question whether thero Is less political corruption at the present tlmo than thoro was boforo 1891. Whllo saloons havo been abolished In many small towns and country districts, largoly through the lnlluenco of women, in tho city of Denver nud lu other largo towns tho sa loon flourishes under tho protection of fa voring laws and in open deflanco of such restrictions ns aro by law established. The political character of tho Flro and Follco board Is held to bo responsible for this con dition of affairs In tho city of Denvor, and It must bo said that tho Civic federation and other women's organizations havo tried to securo homo rulo for Denver without success. Tho social evil has not been obated through tho lnlluenco of woman suf frage, and In general It may be said that no marked social or political transformation has yet been accomplished by this racaiis For all that, it is safe to say that woman tiuffrago has dono no harm, whllo It has dono somo cood and that It has been adopted by Colorado for hotter, for worse. When a man viewing tho whole ques tlou from a purely objective standpoint draws this picture of woman suffrage In practlco tho experiment of Colorado can hardly bo held up as an exumplo for other states to emulate. A striking fact seems to bo revealed by the recent reports for several Insane asylums In the marked change in tno character of Insanity disclosed by the statistics of the patients in into years It Is shown that tho ratio of maniacal Inmates or those with symptoms of ex citement to those exhibiting melancholia or depression, which was formerly to 1. has been reversed so that tho number classed with melancholia now far exceeds tho maniacs. Of course various explanations nre already stig gestcd lu the changed Industrial condl tlons, although tho subject will require longer und moro careful study beforo it can bo thoroughly understood. If should develop that the change is also In the direction of a form of mental dls ease that Is temiiorary and curnblo rather than permanent and Incurable, an ultimate civilization lu which manlucnl insnnlti Is almost wholly eradicated may possibly bo anticipated. The editors of a Chicago paper son tenced for constructive contempt hnvo been released on a writ of habens cor pus. What tho offended Judgo pro nounces .to bo contempt is held by un other Judgo to bo proper criticism, sub Ject only to responsibility for libel Thero is no good reason why every person charged with constructive con temnt of court should not havo the right to a jury trial before a disinter ested aud Impartial Judge. Iown, politicians appear to be having hard time of It lludlug a placo for Governor Shaw, lu fact they ate worry lug much more than the governor him self.

President Roosevelt Insists that the fear of personal violence will never pre vent worthy men front nsplrlng to tire White House.
