I C iv- iyijv t DJ 121003 sS A DIPLOMATIC KETTLE OF WRATH THE STORERS PUBLISH CONFIDENTIAL LETTERS Diplomatic and Political Secrets Hung on the Wash Line Trouble Over Archbishop Irelands Promotion A Row of Large Dimen sions But of Little Practical Consequence The big sensation of the week has been the disclosure by Bellamy snorer of Cincinnati former Congressman ex Mintster to Belrium and to Spain and ex Embassador to Austria of private and Dersonal correspondence that pais ed between him and President velt and between Mrs Storer and Presl dent Roosevelt on topics affecting the Republican Party and the Roman Cath olic Church The Storers had been per sonal and intimate friends cf President Roosevelt from the time the latter was Civil Service Commissioner They great- ly desired the elevation ol Arcnoisnop Ireland to be a Cardinal Ever since Mr Roosevelt was Governor of New York up to the time Mr Stoicr was summarily dismissed last warcn mui his post as Embassador the exchange of correspondence between him and the President as well as between mts Storer and the President was frequent The confidential character of the let ters is shown by those which Mr Stor er allowed to become public propertv He and Mrs Storer addressed the Pres ident as Dear Theodore and thi President addressed them respectively as Dear Bellamy and My Dear Ma ria Following the publication of Mr Storers material the President prompt ly gave his version to the public in the form of a letter to Secretary Root He does not deny the authenticity of the letters which Mr Storer Rives out ad mits that he has Jong thought very highly of Archbishop Ireland and would have been glad could the red hat have been bestowed upon him The Presi dent claims the same kind of interest in Archbishop Irelands elevation that he has had in the welfare of Episcopal Bishop Lawrence of Massachusetts andi of Bishop Cranston of the Methodist Church He denies In toto the conclu sions that Mr Storer draws from th correspondent e and especially the as sertion of Mr Storer that the Presi dent commissioned him to visit th Pope and ask that Archbishop Ireland be given the red hat The nolitical ecclesiastical and diplo matic worlds of Washington have been I disturbed by the disclosures It was very plain that none of the letters was ever intended for the public gaze andi the Storers evidently took this method of retaliating upon the President ex pecting that it would seriously embar rass him with his party They placed the letters In the form of a pamphlet first before the President about thre weeks ago then before members of his Cabinet and finally a few days ago before prominent Senators of the For eign Relations Committee and a few Members of the House The President took particular care that the contents of the pamphlet should not reach th public thru him and he also warned members of his Cabinet to exercise a like caution The fact that it did not leak out from these men seemed to have disappointed the Storers who forthwith mailed another installment this time to Congress and it was not ong before a copy of the pamphlet reached the public and was published first on Saturday morning Lively Interest No newspaper story which has ap peared in recent times created sueli ar Interest as did this one The telegraph wires over the country sang Saturdaj with messages of inquiry and tin White Houe was Hooded with questions cbout the remarkable document The President had anticipated this by writ ing to Secretary of State Root on Deo 2 a long letter for the Information of the Cabinet He set forth in this letter how erroneous the conclusions of the Storers were and how much farther they Had gone in urging the appoint ment of Archbishop Ire lrnd than he had ever intended they should go If- teored both Mr and Mrs Storer in t haracterlstie language upbraided them lor making private and personal corre spondence public and also showed Mrs Storer in the light of a busvbody seek ing to secure promotion for her hus band and constantly meddling In Cath olic Church affairs at the courts of Continental Europe Among the dis closures the President made regarding Mrs Storer was the statement that no sooner had lie become Presidnt in 1901 than she began to Intrigue against members of his own Cabinet hoping to win for Mr Storer the appointment of Secretary of War then held by Ellhu Root or In the event she could not secure that place for her husband to have him appointed Secretary of the Navy Falling in this she wrote the President in very familiar terms de claring that Embassador and Mra Choate were not proper persons to rep resent this country diplomatically and pocially at the Court of St Jahies and also making similar representation in regard to Embassador Porter and the late Mrs Porter at Paris In each ease she represented that Mr Storer wculd make a far better Embassador at either of the Capitals mentioned The correspondence involves both the late President McKinley and Sccretarv of War Taft Mrs Storer lirst asked Mr Roosevelt in 1899 to urge President McKinley to ask the Pope to advance Archbishop Ireland and claims that Mr Roosevelt did make that request and that the late President did trans mit a message thru Bishop OGorinan that the appointment of Archbishop Ireland would be considered a per sonal favor to him the President as well as an honor to the country In his letter to Secretary Root which the President made public Sunday he de nies having made such representation to President McKinley and calls in Postmaster General Corteiyou who was Private Secretary to the late President Mr Corteiyou states his conviction that President McKinley never intrusted anv puch message to Bishop OGorman but was scrupulously particular in this re gard and made no compromise with his convictions on the subject Tlie Storer Story The Storers say that while they were personal guests of the RooscveltS at Oyster Bay and a year or so before at the White House- the subject of Arch bishop Irelands elevation was thoroly discussed They have no letters bear ing on this but only memoranda of the conversations and in the last of these conversations they claim that Mr Roosevelt directed Mr Storer to call at the Vatican and diplomatically ask the Pope to make the appointment Mr Storer it seems did make Mich a cal and Intimation of it leaked out at Rome was cabled to this country and caused much unfavorable comment The incident brought a severe letter of r bulte from the President and i beginning of tho unfriendly rektnjs between the President and the Storers which culminated last March in the summary dismissal of Mr Storer from his post as Embassador President Roosevelt denied in the most strenuous terms that he author ized either Mr Storer or Mrs Storer to make any such representations in his behalf The former Embassador damn that he wrote a letter to President Roosevelt detailing his visit to th Pope Tho President denies that any su h letter was ever received by him or thai there was ever anj warrant for Mr Storei writing it If Mr Storer can produce a copy of this letter thcrt wiil undoubtedly be some further devel opments of international interest The 1ollllenl Aspect The controversy has some very ini poitant political aspects Mr it plain that he at least thought the President was vcr m irh interested if lfsi 32 jr xrs

BEILAMY STORER In securing a large Catholic vote for the Republican ticket in the campaign of 1904 In January of 1904 he wrote a letter to the President reciting the attitude of the Catholic hierarchy to wards the Republican Party and com menting on methods by which the Catholic vote could be brought to the support of Mr Roosevelt Do you know any other influence wc can rely on for this than Archbishop Ireland he asked If you do tell me and then re member very carefully what you tell me- and tally with this what I may do or say all the time triing not to compromise vou The President denounces Mr Stor ers action in making the letters public as peculiar perfidy lie says that the publication of various private letters such as Mr Storer published would have furnished sufficient justification if sucn were needed for his summary dismissal -from the Diplomatic Sen ice He also dwells upon the Embassadors refusal to answer letters that wera written him shortly before the Presi dent dismissed him Altho politicians have been greatly perturbed by the disclostue the Presi dent has informed ills friends that he is not worried at all by these disclos ures He does regret having been drawn into a personal controversy and also regrets that Archbishop Ireland should be embarrassed by what the Storers have made public The Presi dent was at lirst disposed to make no reply whatever lest lie thus give the matter added importance to the popu lar mind but the conclusion Stirer drew and the repre sentations lie made regarding person i com cr al ions were such that the Presi dent finnllj decided to state his own side of tli cae His friends say lie lias done very effectively -

felt for him he represents Hie type of Catholic ism which in my opinion must prevail in tlie United States if the Catholic Church is to attain Us full measure or power and usefulness with our people and under our form of Government Of course 1 feel that I am not Justified in interfering in any way directly or Indirectly with matters in the Vatican but it is only fair in re sponse to your letter that I should write you fully and frankly of my great ap preciation of Archbishop Ireland and it my firm conviction that the real future of the Catholic Church inAmerica rests with those who in the main work along his lines You may be Interested to know of the large percentage of Catho lics without exception men standing as high in capacity as in integrity whom I have placed upon the various impor tant commissions in this State Morcrn Fateful Interview On Dec 2 1903 Mr Storer had nn audience with Pope Pius X and de livered In French a memorandum which he had taken of the Presidents oral message to the Pope He preserved this memorandum and it reads as follows He said to me and he authorized mc to say to Your Holiness that th j Archbishop of St Paul is his personal friend and that ho possesses all his confidence as prelate and citizen that he desires emphatically for Mgr Ire land all tho honors of the Church an 1 that he will see with the greatest pleas ure anei Hatlsfnctlon the elevation of Mgr Ireland to the Cardinalato It will be remembered that this ac tion of Storer when reported in the United States Taised the very mischief in Protestant circles and the President was extremely wroth The letter 1k sent in reply is printed in the pamphlet which Storer supplied so copiously to Congress tho Cabinet and others Tho President proceeded in plain English to read Mr Storer the riot act 011 quoting him on Church matters and told him not to do it again Mr Storer declared that the Presidents treatment of him filled him with astonishment And he declared that he had spoken with the Presidents express wish Later the President wrote lilm again on the subject And as the President would say that letter was a corker He closed the letter by sayjng While I am President and you are Embassador neither of us in his public relation is to acL as Catholic or Protes tant Jew or Gentile and we have to be careful not merely to do what is right but so to carry ourselves as to shovv that we are doing what Is right I shall ask you not to quote meto any person in any shape or way In connection with any affair of the Catholic Church and yourself not to take action of any kind which will give -ground for tho belief that you as an American Embassador are striving to interfere in the affairs of the Church Ie ltcrM anil telters There were letters and letters The Storers wrote to tho President and the President to Dear Bejlamy and Dear Maria and Bellamyrind Maria kept doing things tho had told them expressly and in warm language not to do they- quoted sentences from his letters which meant one thing there and an entirely different thing when taken with the context The President finally wrote Mrs Storer a letter which must lit fe curled her hair in which ho told her that she had violated his con fidence and with malice aforethought gone about making troubio in clerical circles for him and he wasnt going to stand It any longer and for her to send back to him every letter in which he ever mentioned ecclesiastical matters Maybe the President got his letters back and maybe he didnt It appears from those that Storer has seen fit to make public that he copied the letters or so much of them as he wanted to use before he returned them if they were returned And then the long suffering President who had been wounded in the house of his friends simply fired Mr Storer The Storer Imiqililt t Since that time last March the Stor ers have been thinking up this pamph let It was printed on Sunday last and made such good Sunday reading that lots of people not having time to read it at home took it to church and read it as the collection box passed by per haps Anyhow they read it Mondav the President of the United States out raged to the innermost corner of 1 is heart where he keeps a shrine- for his nearest and dearest friends as he had a right to believe the Storers weie came back at Mr and Mrs Storer and what lie said made gjod reading too Better reading than the Sunday story a good deal because the President vin dicated himself and his purposes Ho addresses his story to Secretary of State Root and says that lie thlnks the Cabinet should first be advised of the matter in hand singe the Storr pamphlet had been sent to eacii mem ber of the Cabinet and then the Presi dent as did Mr Storer gave the same statement to the press It Is never pleasant to have to dis cuss personal affairs tho President de clares or to quote -or explain from personal correspondence which is one reason why it is held to be a peculiarly ungentlemanly thing to publish private correspondence But as Mr Storer In his extraordinary pamphlet prints vari ous letters written by himself by me and by Mrs Storer I shall set forth briefly the facts of the case- giving cer tain letters which areneeessary in oi lier 10 uuucrsianu cieany those which he prints Mr Storer asserts that -he and Mrs Storer and various other people after conversations with me piit down mem nranda as to what they remembered 1 had said If such action was taken it was of course simply dishonorable Mrs Storer wrote m with great frnfom and sometimes it was difficult to low quite how to answer her Both sto and Mr Storer continually made atta ks upon all sorts of people ciaiy dignitaries of her own church Chronic liecsura He said that he had scarcely become PresiTlent when both the Storers began to bombard him with requests to do things for them On Sept 22 1901 eight days after President McKinley died Mrs Storer wrote me urging that I should appoint Mr Storer to the Cabinet and specify ing as a desirable place the War De partment of which you Mr Root were the head the letter running Please give -him either the Navy or War I pray that Bellamy who so richly deserves it shah have a chance for honorable service at home to his country When X explained that I did not intend to remove anyone or niako any changes in the Cabinet at the time she wrote mo on Oct 17 suggest ing tho Embassies at

catering to the prospective ne gro delecalcs in ills active champion ship f tho discharged soldiers Senator Foraker lias taken the occasion to state with some spirit that no one of the 8000000u people In the United States has ever heard him say that he was a candidate for the Presidency That Is undoubtedly true as many men here In Washington have heard the Senator say that much as he would prize the Presi dency as a political honor he was fully aware of the futility of his declaring himself in the race until it had become apparent from the trend of events whether It would be of any use for him to do so There is likewise a lot of dynamite in the Japanese question and Senator Rayiior of Maryland is still hankering to astound the Senate with the detona tion of his first stick of the

will fail because of the men who are ready to make politi cal capital out of the effort To a lot of people in these United States 5000 may seem like all the money in the world It is a lot of money and yet there are good argu ments on both sides of the proposition to increase the salaries of Congressmen There are plenty of Members of the House and plenty of Senators who are worth much more than 5000 a year with mileage and perquisites to the country But there are also a plenty of Members and a plenty of Senators who are not worth half that sum to the country It Is necessary of course to strike an average price and that is what the present law regarding their compensation is supposed to do Tlintd Invrmukrra The timidity of lawmakers in voting themselves money has been marked ever since the famous salary grab bill Qf Grants second Administration which is tne law under which the President receives 50000 a year and Members of Congress in both its branches 5000 a year Prior to that time the respec tive salaries had been only half that amount but 2500 a year 30 years ago went farther In Washington than 2500 a year would go now And again the cost of Congressional campaigns was not as much in those days as it is now But the country resented the salary grab and many many Republicans who thought they could vote for the increase with impunity found themselves elected to stay at home and the Democrats came into control of the House of Rep resentatives In the middle of Grants second term for the first time since the beginning of the civil war If Democrats would bargain to stand for the increased salary without mak ing strenuous objections it would go thru The Republicans headed bv some eager plunderers want a hard and fast compact so that when the campaign conies on in 190S the Democrats can not reap political advantage Many Democrats would like to enter the com pact for It happens that the Southern ers who comprise most of the Demo cratic membership of Congress are not wealthy men nnd the increase In wages would be quite as welcome to them as to their Northern brethren more well-to-do But the Southerners have to fight for their nominations at primaries where all men of the party turn out to vote The fixing of conventions is now pretty much a lost art In the Southland and accordingly these Representatives fear a compact lest enterprising aspirants make that an

woods There promises to be somebody but guileless tourists in the galleries A good fight commands an audience In the Senate Chamber and the House Chamber as quickly as it does anywhere else in the

Is brisk Sen ator Iorakcr has come out In the open as the champion of the discharged stationery etc that he gets from tilt Government but it nevertheless re mains that ever since he landed In Washington he has not been modest in getting for himself anything and everything that he could get under th law He has been one of the stoutest in clamoring for the extra mileage that came from the extra session of the 58th Congress more than three years ago It will be recalled that President Roose velt summoned Congress here in No vember 1903 one month before the regular session convened The extri session continued right up -to noon o Dec 7 when -the regular session began by law While there was hardly a minute between the time that the extra session closed and the regular session began and no Senator and no Member had time even to go downstairs to th6 restaurant let alone time to go back to his home there were many Congress men who tried to slide thru a provision allowing them extra mileage which would have been 20 cents for every mile between Washington and his home There was such an outcry in the public press that the Senate struck out the provision for extra mileage which the House had passed and ever since then the House has been grumbling among the grumblers having been the Hon Jim Tawney Chairman of th9 House Committee on Appropriations and sometime member of the famous hog combine He Is not the sole moving spirit in the proposed salary grab however There are plenty of member of the Appropriation Committee to stand with him Hs many aids stand with him for numerous reasons They find the cost of living in Washington growing greater and greater every year It costs more to live at the hotels and also more to live at ones own Washington residence This is not altogether due to the fact that nearly everyone who now comes to Washington wants to live in better styt8 and to have conveniences that a Con gressman would not have thought of wanting 10 or 15 years ago The de mands for cash are exacting upon a Congressman who cares to keep up ap pearances at the Capital It has be come the custom for many of his con stituents to wander down to Washing ton at some time during the Members two years term Railroad traveling is cheaper than it used to be Constitu ents have more money travel more anil consequently can get to Washington h greater numbers Demands From Constituents Most of these constituents seek out their Congressman Some of them go chiefly to see him perhaps to consult with him The Congressman has to show them a little attention These at tentions range all the way from simply showing them about the Capital and introducing them to a few of the nota bles to taking them out to dinner at a fashionable hotel and entertaining them in the evening at the theater If tho Congressman does not loosen up a lit tle in those things his constituents go back home and report that he is very near as one of the famous characters in Dickens noted for being stingy was described The extent to which a Congressman i3 subject to these depredations upon his private purse depend considerably upon the distance of his district from Wash ington There are two
