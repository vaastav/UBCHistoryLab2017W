FORGERY ADDED TO THE CRIMES CHARGED AGAINST HIM. HOW HE SUCCEEDED IN KLIN DING Til K HAM K OFFICIALS. The Dishonest Career of tile Former Discount Clerk He Forge the Nam of HI Friend in Order to Obtain Money. Portland, M., Deo. 7. The committee who are investigating Howard D. Blii'-lc- stone's stealings t'rum the Canal National bank have discovered the methods by which the frauds were committed, ami further more that forgery was added to the crim; of embezzlement. The ordinary routine of discounting notes is for the notes to be handed to the directors to pass upon them; after the directors have decided wheth r they will accept them they are handed to the discount clerk, who puts them on th.i list. They are then passed to the cashier, who puts his initials and the data on them to sl ow that they passed through bis bands, and that he has looked the:u over; then they are banded back to the discount clerk, to remain in bis keeping. He made notes of his own, say one for $500, for instance, forging somebody's name as maker or in dorsee This note he passed through the usual forms without its going to the cashier or directors. In order to do this he took the opportunity when he was acting as pay ing teller, in the absence of Mr. Peters, and would pay the discount slips to himself. For example, the 500 note was in the name of a person who was not a regular customer of the bank. It would not be credited to him, but when he came in and asked if his note was discounted che discount clerk would give him a slip of paper with the amount on it, to lie passed to the paying teller. These slips he made out, and as pay ing teller he paid the money to himself, and when the not ;s matured he paid them by discounting on other notes in tne same way. The notes were not left behind by Mr. Blackstoue, but only figures on the books to show how the rascality was accomplished. It was a most ingenious system, and prob ably could not have been accomplished but for the opportunity offered by filling the paying teller's position so often and last summer for so long a time. The great question that now agitates the ' minds of the directors is, how he managed to elude the national bank examin r, Mr. Wiswell, when that gentleman made his an nual examination. The only way they can think of U is that ho. did it by forged ..nohjK. The full amount of the bank's losi is not yet known. The directors are hard at work, and it will probably soon be ascertained.

Unable to bear the strain upon his mind any longer, ..Doc" Wilson, yesterday, broken down In h, alth. and weening like a child, told the great secret which hos existed between him and P. L. Moen, or Worcester, tor so many veal's. 'I am looked at ns a blackmailer," ho said, "ami tlms.i who believe I have been bleeding that old man, uoiu me in as mucn contempt us a yellow dog. But I will stand it no longer. 1 am more sinned against thun sinning, and now the truth shall be known. My name is not WiUon, nor am I the son of Jonas Wilson. My father is the man who is accusing ma of blackmail, and my name is 1-ievi Much, the lawful son of P. L. Moen, of Worcester." WoKCitKTKR, Mass., Dec. 8. Records of the town of Oxford, Mass., show that Levi Wilson was born theru Dec. 1, 185:1, eleven months after Mrs. Moen died. Boston, Dec. 3. United States Commis sioner Hallett has refused to issue a warrant against Philip L. Moen for porjury, on the complaint of Levi Wilson. Phovidencb, R. I., Dec. 3.

East Thompson, Conn., Dec. 4. Doc Wilson's mother, well-preserved at 67, and now living here with her second hus band, Lyman Porter, made the positive as sertion when, interviewed that she was the 'claimant's" mother, and that Jonas Wil son was his father. Furthermore she said that she thought it disgraceful in her son to deny his parentage, and that he must be demented, or ho never would have made such a fctit-ment. - Mrs. Port .-r bears a perfect resemblance to Doe, as do his sisters. Mrs. Jerry Young, of Danielsouville, and Mrs. Cbrsws Hoyte, of Porter Plains. Mrs. Jerry Young was also interviewed and stated that she had not the slight st doubt that Levi Wilson was her brother; that she was about 12 years old when his birth occurred, and she remembers the event quit clearly. Mrs. John Wilson was next seen, but would have nothing to say. She did not wish in any way to be connected with the affair. She bad no doubt that Levi Wilson was legitimately born to Mrs. Jonas Wilson. Dr. Rawson, the physician who was present at the birth of Doc. was seen by Mr. Porter less than a month ago, and was told by him that Doc Wilson was born to Mrs. Jonas Wilson. With all of these 'convincing statements there can be no doubt that Doc's assertion that he is a son of Moen is a falsehood. As to the secret, all of the members of the family positively deny any knowledge of it. .New Haven, Uonn., Dec. 4. Mrs. Mary Downs.Ljf nsonia is a, sister of Levi Wil son.' Hue suld that "Doc" Wilson was her brother and that this was the first she ever heard that he was the son of Moen.
