Sensational Charge by District Attorney in Hummel Case. 

NECESSARY TO GUARD CHIEF WITNESS IN GOTHAM SCANDAL Sequel of Dodge-Morse Divorce Casej I Proves More Interesting Than First ; Act of Notorious Suit. I New York, Poc. 13. Abraham H. ! Hummel, the atlorney, was placed on J tral tol iy before Justice Rogers In i the criminal branch of the supreme i , coiirt on I ho charge of conspiracy and subornation of perjury In conn.ctlon SI - ith the Dodge-Morse divorce case md when court adjourned this after noon only four jurors had been se lected. Counsel for the accused law yer, made an effort to have the trial di-liyed, but Justice Hogers, .overrule 1 all the various motions having that end in view. , Killing the course of the argument? tod iy, Assistant District Attorney Hand, who Is in charge of tli-s prose cution of the case, made th? assertion that efforts had been mad'.1 bv "th-i other side" to kill Charles r Dodge, the most Important wltnesj against Hummel. Mr. Kami said It was neces sary to guard Dodge constantly. Me uig"d this as one reason for an early hearing of the case. The charge against Humnu' grew out of the sensational Dodge-Morse divorce litigation ..In which i! was al leged that Hummel entered into a con. I "piracy to secure perjured cvKier.ce. I Former Supreme Court Justice lid ! gar L. Fursnian also was Indit'ed on a charge or conspiracy in irtrf same case The conspiracy and perjury ch uires were made after an Investi ga Hon by District Attorney Jerome of allegations that the courts had been made use of in an improper manner j in efforts to procure the annulment i of Hie decree of divorce obtained by Mrs. Clements Dodge against Charles I F. Dodge. After the divorce Mrs. I Dodge married Charles W. Morse, i who was very prominent in banking land steamship affairs. The real ob- iject of the desire to obtain annulment j .wp Dodge divorce was said to be to investigate the marriage of M rs. Dodge and Morse. Hummell appear ed as attorney for Dodge and pre sented a claim by Dodue that lie never was-, properly served with a summons In Mis. Dodge's suit, that lie was rep ifsnled by counsel at the trial and that he knew nothing of the matter until he was served wllti a certificate of the deVree. Former Justice Fuii man then came Into the case as coun sel for Mrs. Morse and letra I proceed ings proceeded to the point where on Januarv 4. 1904. the Dodge-Morse an nulment was entered In the supreme court. Then, an attorney named Sweetstar who" had served papers on Dodge and who had been at work on the case to save his professional repu- Ion. discovered letters from Dodge tr Mortimer Ruger, also an attorney. myi,,. ,at ne tuougej ni4u iiem .., i ti,- divorce , d autnoriy.iK Kuger to act as llUorney.

SERIOUS SPLIT MAY RESULT I IN MINORITY IN THE HOUSE! Representatives Resent Action of: Democratic Dictator in Slicing ; Them Off Committee. Washington, Dec. 13. The "wash ing" of democratic linen for the amusement of the republieanV, as Mr. Williams, the minority leader, put It Monday, occupied the attention of the house for more than four hours today. The result accomplished was a "di-fi," Í thrown at the minority leader by Uep- resentatlve Liimar, of Florida, and an-i other by Representative Shackleford. Í of Missouri. The complaint of both! resulted In the failure of Mr. Williams ' to recommend their reappointment as j members of the committee on inter- ! state and foreign commerce. Both ' made long speeches In which Mr. Wil- I Hams' leadership was assailed from ninny points. Mr. Williams replied to i I Mr. Iotmar at some length and brletlv I to Mr. Shackleford. His defense was' that at the lust session the democrats on this committee were divided and r he deemed It necessary for the good of! the party and the country that a unit- ed minority report should be made on ' the subject of railroad rate legislation, i At times there was high tension In the I debate. Mr. Lamar was particularly i bitter In Ills criticism, and openly de-! dared that tils heretofore personal friendship for Mr. Williams was for- I ever at an end. I nless the criticism of himself were retracted, he never would recognize Mr. Williams as the party leader. Mr. Shackleford denounced alT boss es and placed himself entirely Inde pendent of party leadership In the house. The subject under discussion was the committee distribution of the annual message of President Roose velt. At the conclusion of the demo cratic debate this had not been Accom plished and the house adjourned.

LLEWELLYN MAKES VKJOROFS Alttil MENT FOR .IOINTI KU Special to the Morning Journal, Washington. D. C. Dee. 13.

W. in. in an 1 had expected lo leave for New Met- Ico ye-itenlav but remained for tho meeting with the president today. Since Ills arrival here, the former roiili rider has had a number of con ferem e.s with the president regarding federal appointments and statehood. Major Llewellyn has come to the con clusion that Joint statehood for New Mexico and Arizona must come. In an Interview he said: "The sentiment favoring Joint statehood Is rapldlv. gaining ground Ill New Mexico. In my opinion the people of New Mexico and Arizona will accept Joint statehood when the constitution is presented to 'them for their approval, provided that the constitution contains u certain safe guard which will be required by the business Interests of both territories. Tlv t e must be a provision limiting lh lndeliiilness which can be In curred. This restriction must not exceed four per cent of the assessed villi 1 1 Ion of the property, as is now 'idvlded In what Is known as the springer ai I in congress. There must be a provision In the constitution pro hibiting the voting of bonds for the coiiMtruotlnii of railroads, as well as i provision limiting the term of gov ernor to four years mid disqualifying him from being a candidate for the foiled Slates senate Immediately af ter his term expires as governor. This is to prevent the use of his office as governor to elect himself a United) States senator. ! Opposition io Joint Statehood. "The opposition to Joint statehood Is of a dual character -one sentimen tal on account of provincialism, and the other on account of the large area. New Mexico Is larger than New Knglahd. yet Hie Joint slate will be smaller than Texas, although slightly larger Iban California. The Idea that Arizona and New Mexico are divided In business Intercourse Is erroneous."
