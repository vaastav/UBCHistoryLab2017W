CE YEAR fir iIFRATr Ul uLUnIL ENEMIES OF GERMAN TARIFF DE TERMINED TO DELAY PASSAGE AT ALL HAZARDS UNITED STATES NOT FEARED Remarkable Ilesalln Are Shown by Comparison of the Work of American and German Workmen YANKEE CRAFTSMEN SWIFT BERLIN, Dec. 7.—The tariff bill goes to the committee next week and nobody ex pects its reappearance for month 3. Her ron Babel and Richter and other opposi- tion leaders have agreed to delay the measure as long as possible in commit tee. They are determined to make a light on every one of the 946 items. This well worn form of parliamentary obstruction is to be continued in the house after it leaves the committee and it is quite pos sible that the final vote frill not be reach ed till 1903, unless the government offers a compromise, which is unlikely. The gov ernment, being aware of the dilatory tactics ahead, is considering changing the rules of the house so as to block the obstructive tactics of the oppositions A variety of estimates of the majority for or against the bill are in calcula tion. The general impression is that the • government commands a large majority. It is not the United States that the gov ernment would be concerned about should the tariff bill be put through in its pres ent form, but Russia and Austria-Hun gary. It is the belief of the foreign of fice that Germany is well able to hold up her side should the United States make reprisals, but Russia and Austria-Hun gary already have informed Germany that they are not willing to negotiate com mercial treaties on the basis of the pend ing tariff. These notifications are con sidered equivalent to the declaration of an economic war In which the board mar kets now open to Germany will immedi ately be closed find the considerable vol ume of Unied States products now find ing their way to Russia through German traders would in consequence be excluded with German goods. American Workmen Are Swift. The manager of an American company's . works in Berlin has made a remarkable comparison of the wages paid and cost of tools made here with the wages paid and cost of tools at the American v*irks, both sets of laborers using identical machines. He finds that the American wornman, making an exact allowance for the dif ference in wages, turns out a clear 25 per cent more product for the same unit of wages. Man for man the German produces only two-fifths of what an American does. A shoe factory in Bres lau, using American machinery, secured better results by importing eight Ameri can workmen and paying them by the piece, to stimulate the. German workmen wiho then came within 10 per cent of the Americans' work. The American insurance companies, which have complied with the law com ing into force with the new year, trans ferring the control of insurance from the state government to the imperial gov ernment, know that their concessions may be withdrawn whenever the government chooses. The law is framed so that it is really left to the discretion of the gov ernment when licenses are grante'a or de nied to foreign companies and Americans run the risk of having their privileges canceled should Germany and the United States have an economic disagreement. CURIOUS ABOUT TRUSTS TRANCE WILL SEXD A SAVANT TO INVESTIGATE THEM The Only Country Absolutely Pro hibiting Any Form of Trust W mils to Know if Com bine* Help or Hurt. PARIS, Dec. 7.—M. Lazare Weiler, counselor of foreign commerce, who, with M. Maurice La Cotellerie, an engineer, has been entrusted by the government wilh the task of making a special investi gation of American trusts, told a repre sentative of the Associated Press today that he will also make inquiries in aid of the government's plans of organizing an industrial college. He is a strong sup porter of ihe project and of the foster ing of closer commercial relations be tween the two countries. The govern ment has examined the suggestion to send commercial students also, but is in disposed to adopt this step until tne in dustrial experiment shall nave been tried. M. Weiler's inquiry in the matter of the trusts will occupy about four months. The government is anxious to have a competent opinion upon the effects of the formation of big trusts and to what ex tent they count in the industrial progress of the United States. This matter is of peculiar interest to France, which is the only country enforcing the law, dating ba.ck to the revolution, absolutely pro hibiting any form of trust.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. — Among the candidates who were considered by Roosevelt for the vacancy on the federal bench in the Indiana-Illinois-Wisconsin district was E. D. Crumpacker, of La Porte county, Indiana. He.was appellate judge of the state under Gov. Hovey, and is now a member of congress. But Judge Crumpacker was opposed to the Porto Rican hill and voted against it in the last congress. This fact was related to the president, and he was told that Crumpacker was an anti-expansionist and a radical man. Senator Fairbanks' friends were kind enough to emphasize this point. The president was convinced, and Crumpacker was stricken from his list of eligibles. The other day the president wanted some advice about candidates who were under consideration, and oddly enough sent for Crumpacker. But the judge is independent. He sent back word that he did not care to give any opinion, as he could not conceive it possible that the president would be influenced by the ad vice of a man whom he regarded as too biased to exercise the judicial functions without political prejudice. In polite terms,' he told Roosevelt to go to , well, to that place of outer darkness, flames and the gnashing of teeth.

COMMANDER FAVORS BOTH M'KIXLEY MEMORIALS Canton Advocates to Have Public Subscriptions, and Congress to Be Asked to Build the Arch. FROM THE GLOBI2 BIREAU, Washington, I). C. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—ln the scrap between the McKinley Memorial associa tion and the McKinley Arch association, the commander of the G. A. R. is com mitted to the Canton, Ohio, project. Judge Torrance was asked to become a member of coirffnittee, of which Hanna is the leading spirit. He accepted. Then he was appointed a member of committee to build an arch in Washington. He was obliged to declino. Judge Torrance has been here today trying the role of peaceaker. He favors both memorials to McKinley, and hepes to bring about harmony between the memorialists. As a member of the Can ton project committee he voted for resolutions passed today urging congress to appropriate money for the arch. Thus the field could be left open to the other crowd to go anead and get popular sub scriptions. They already have $250,000, so the memorial at Canton is assured. Monday the arch crowd will meet and decide whether to accept the resolution of the Canton crowd and rely on the gen erosity of congress. A canvass of mem bers of the arch committee reveals the fact that most are disposed to accept, so there is a prospect of harmony being re stored.

TOO MUCH REAL ESTATE THE OMAHA LOAN AND TRUST COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN DIFFICULTIES EASTERN CREDITORS AN.XIOUS President Wyman Asserts Solvency of the Company Depends Very Largely on Value of Property MAY OWE HALF A MILLION OMAIIA, Neb., Dec. 7.—The directors of the Omaha L,oan and Trust company are in session tonight with Edward Bet tle, of Philadelphia, who represems the Eastern creditors of the institution. A. U. Wyman, president of the com pany, was asked this afternoon as to the condition of the company's affairs. He said: "If real estate values were such that we could realize from property what t represents to us there would be no ques tion about th solvency of the company. The condition of the company is as un certain as real estate values on outlying property have been for the past few years," The Omaha Loan and trust company was organized in 1885 with a capital stock of $500,000 which was fully paid up. Mr. Wyman said its business had been that of making loans on city property and farm lands and in the sixteen years it had been in business it had placed be tween $12,000,000 and $15,000,000 in real estate mortgages. In the majority of cases it had made its own loans and then sold many mortgages to Eastern in vestors. These loans have all been made in Nebraska with the exception of many Misourl farm loans. As to the nature of the company's lia bilities Mr. Wyman said he was unable to speak with certainty, but would probably make a statement later. He said that some time ago it owed $650,000 on its debenture bonds, but he thought that amount had been somewhat reduced. The guarantees of the company on se curities it had handled and of interest payments had, he said, also involved it to some extent. A large amount of their mortgages were put up some time ago to protect the debentures. The directors of the trust company are A. U. Wyman, Guy C. Barton, E. W. Nash, J. H. Millard, W. W. Wallace, E. M. Morsman and George B. Lake. Mr. Wyman is president and his son, "W. T. Wyman, is secretary and treasurer.

IN QUEST* OF IDEAS MAXITOBA COMMISSION VISITS STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE AT ST. A\THO.\Y PARK SYSTEM OF TEACHING GOOD George H. Halse, H. C. Simpson, J. H. Irwin and J. I. Miller, o£ Winnipeg, are in the city as representatives of the Mani toba government, to visit the agricultural school of St. Anthony park. The commis sion was appointed to inspect several agricultural colkges in the United States and the one at Guelph, Ont., and to report to the legislature a course of study to be adopted in the new agricultural school which will be established by the govern ment. They spent yesterday at the experi mental farm and expressed themselves as well pleased with the work that is being done there and the methods upon which the institution is conducted. They visited the school at Fargo last week, and will leave here Tuesday to in spect the lowa State colege at Ames. From there they will go to Illinois, Wis consin and Michigan, and then will go to Guelph. The tour will last the rest of the month when they will return to Win nipeg to prepare their report. They ex pect to meet Hon. Thomas Greenway, ex-premier of Manitoba, also a member of the commission, and he will accom pany them on their tour. Mr. Halse said to The Globe last evening that he was greatly pleased with his visit to the Minnesota institution. He thought tne management had succeed ed in solving the greatest problem that the agricultural school has to contend withi which is to take the boy from the farm, give him an education and return him to the farm. He said many schools failed to return the troy to the farm after he had received his education. This is a thing the Manitoba people want to avoid. They want to give their bpys a practical education in farming and then have them return to use the education. When asked what wotilii probably be the course of study recommended by the com mission, Mr. Halse said It will strictly be an agricultural course and that no branches will be taught that are hot vital ly connected with farming In this way he hopes to interest the students In the work and remove the temptation to aban don it for some other calling:. Mr. Halse says it.is fl»t probable that the school will be established ha connec tion with the Canadian Government farm at Brandon, but will be established in another part of the province. The school will have an experimental farm In con nection with it and will give a thorough course in stock raising. The commission hopes to have a confer ence tomorrow with Mr. A. B. Stickney, president of the Great-Western, and will listen to his views on diversified farming after which it will leave for Ames, lowa.

CRYING FOR HELP EPISCOPAL CHURCH HAS MANY PRESSING NEEDS IN ITS MISSION WORK LACKING IN ZEAL AND MONEY Church at Large Mast Have a New Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and Apathy Must Be Cast Off HIT AT DR. SHELDON JACKSON ROCHESTER, N. . V., Dec. 7. — The Episcopal missionary conference came to an end tonight. The conference, in the opinion of those who are closest in touch with it. has brought out distinctly the following things: First—The Episcopal church has a pre eminent call to mission work in Latin- American lands. Second—lt sadly needs young men for its mission work, both at home and abroad. Third—lts supply of funds for prosecut ing its present mission work and for en tering upon its large opportunities is ut terly inadequate. Fourth—The laity and even some of the bishops and clergy are responsible for the apathy which prevails throughout the church toward missions. Fifth—The church at large needs a re vival, a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit and systematic instruction in order that zeal for mission work may be aroused, stimulated and sustained. Sdxth—The men of the church should be systematically organized for the pur pose of coming to the aid of the mis sionary cause and sharing the burdens which have so long rested upon the wom en and children. There has been no effort to minimize or gloss over these difficulties and faults in the conference. The Rt. Rev. Peter Trible Rowe, D. D., bishop of Alaska, said to a representa tive of the Associated Press: "We sadly need money for hospitals, for schools and for native helpers. We are the only denomination in Alaska who train the natives to help us in our mis sion work. They are content to work for $100 a year, which we pay them in food. We have three hospitals in Alaska. They are alleviating untold misery, but we want to build more, especially at Nome. The others are at Rampart, Cir cle City and Skagway. Our native schools could be planted everywhere, but we have rot the money to plant them. Dr. Sheldon Jackson, the commissioner of schools for Alaska, is a Presbyterian, andhe has 'helped the schools of his o%n denomination with government money, but our schools receive not a penny from the government."

CIRCLE OF HEVELIUS CLEVELAND ASTRONOMER MAKES . BMARICABLE OBSERVATION. 1' CLEVELAND, Dec. 7.—A remarkable meterological observation that undoubt edly will become historical in astronomy vras made here yesterday by Rev. Fred erick Odenbach, S. J.,professor of physlfls in St. Ignatius college. The observation was that of the great sun circle or halo of Hevelius, which has only been ob served three times before and probably never so perfect. Preceding a period of low barometric pressure, halos often are noticed about the sun. The commonest of these halo 3 is one that appears at a distance off 22 degrees from the su"n. An outer halo, at a distance of 46 degrees is also occasion ally noted. But the great halo of Hevel ius, at a distance of 90 degrees, as ob-' served by Prof. Odenbach, is a great rarity and hundreds of years may pass before it is observed again. The inner circle of 22 degrees was complete, por tions of the 46-d€gr«e circle were distinct and the great circle of Hevelius was distinct for half of its circumference. Many Times a Murderer.

SQUELCHING BEVERIDGE OUS-TIMBRS IX SENATE SEEK XA'G TO SIBETUACIv ALBERT A Fortuitous Chain of Circumstances Puts the Hoosier Orator in Line for a Good Chnirmniishii). FROM THE GLOBE HI It 10 A I.', Washington, D. C. WASHINGTON, Dec. ".-Some of the old senators are trying to keep Senator Beveridge from the chairmanship of the committee on territories, to which he is entitled by the law of seniority. George L.. Shoup, of Idaho, was chairman, but he was not re-elected. William J. Sew ■ell, of New Jersey, is next in order, but he is very ill, and is not expected to do any work in this session. Then come Carter and Thurston, two more who have fallen by the wayside; then Kyle, of South Dakota, who died last summer. This leaves Beveridge and Dillingham as the only surviving Republican mem bers of the old committee, and Beveridge would naturally be chairman. But with four territories clamoring for admission to statehood there is prospect that this committee will be an important one this winter, and instead of Beveridge being burled, as was the intention when he was honored with this appointment, he be comes a very important personage. Thus it happens that the covetous old gentle men in the millionaires' club would like to down the little newcomer, and are even disposed to set aside their immemo rial custom to do it. If they do, there will be doings; for there are others.

WORDS TO BE WEIGHED PRESBYTERIAN CREED REVISERS TAKING THEIR TIME TlicniM to Be Considered and Em bodied in New Declaration Cannot Be Acted on Liehllj. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Two sessions were held today of the revision committee of the general Presbyterian assembly. A statement issued by the committee says: "The committee Is making progress, but it Is evident that in discussing the great questions before it, progress must be slow, and nothing final can be arrived at for a week or more. When such themes as God and the trinity, revelation and creation, the divine decree and the fall of men are under consideration, and statements that will be satisfactory to the church are to be prepared, it Is ob vious that both care and time must be required. It can be said that throughout the discussions have been most harmon ious and the committee is animated by the one purpose of preparing a form that will be at once true and satisfactory to the church."

CONFERRING WITH ROOT .SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS FORE* SEEN IN CONNECTION WITH vi PHILIPPINE TARIFF / LEADERS ARE WORRYING If the Adjustment of Condition* to -Supreme Court Decision In Made .■ a Party Question, a ; Bitter^}\h ' ; •' Contest is Sore ■ ; RECIPROCITY CLAUSE FAVORED WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—An important conference was held at the war depart ment today in regard te th". legislation necessary to meet fiscal condition in the Philippines as a result of the recent In sular decisions of the supreme court. There were present Secretary' Root, Sena tors Lodge and Platt, of Connecticut, and Representatives Payne and Dalzell. During the afternoon Senator Spooner called at the war department and talk- <i with Secretary Root about the legislative necessities of the Philippines. It ap pears that the problem pM-sented is not so easy as was supposed when it was thought that a simple joint resolution could be piit through congress within a. few days to continue practically existing tariff rates as to Philippine exports and imports. Some members of the ways and means committee see difficulties growing out oC the existence of an export tax in the islands and there is much apprehension! that the issue may be made a party one, with the result that there will be a bit ter struggle, at least in the senate. If not in the house, before satisfactory leg islation can be had. It is the expectation, however, that after hearing from all of the leaders Secretary Root will be able to perfect a plan of action by Tuesday, when the house next meets. It Is learned that in the course of the conference today, Secretary Root took advantage of the opportunity to talk freely with his callers about the pressing needs of Cuba, and to urge early action upon the legislation along the line recommended In his last annual report. Reciprocity Clause Talked Of. A movement Is on foot among the Re publican members of the ways and means committee to Incorporate a reciprocity feature in the forthcoming Philippine tariff bill. As roughly outlined In the informal talks thus far had among mem bers of the committee, the reciprocity, provision would recite that when the Philippine commissioners reduce the duty; on certain designated articles, including American textiles and various goods easily marketable in the Philippines, then the president of the United States shall by proclamation grant stated reductions of duty on Philippine sugar and other pro ducts shipped to tills ceimtry. This le eiprocity provision would be along the lines of that provided in the Dingley act. whereby President McKinley, by proc lamation, made tariff reductions on a limited number of articles without th« formality of a treaty. A reciprocity provision on the foregoing lir.es was discussed at the meeting of Republican members of the committee last Friday afternoon and received very; favorable consideration, although action' was deferred until the reassembling of the Republican members on Monday. Chairman Payne probably will call a! meeting of the full committee on Tues day, when the Republican draft of .« Philippine bill may be ready, although; no definite understanding on this point has been reached.
