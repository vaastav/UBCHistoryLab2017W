Tbe President's Message. We pubireli on the outside of this week's issue, the Annual Message of President Lincoln. 1. It is jell written, proving at onoa that it is not tho produc tion of Mr. Lincoln. There are no plebeian expressions or childish jokes in it as were found in his first Message. I He J'goes in" for the Publio debt and National Bank system. He also urges the immediate amendment of the Consti tution so as to abolisn slavery throughout the United ' States; 'forgetting that he said in his Inaugural Address that it was not his purpose nor had he aiiy right, to interfere with alavery. He declares with out any attempt .whatever to prove the same, "tht no attempt' at negotiations with the Confederates would result in any good." He thinks that a vigorous pros ecution of the war the only means by which a Settlement of the national diffi culties can be effected. He further says in regard to the slavery question, that "I retract nothing heretofore said aa to ela very ;" .also, "I shall not attempt to re tract or modify the Emancipation Procla mation," even if the Union can be re stored thereby!- In this respect the mes sage is radical and can afford no, lope to the many who looked for some measure to be introduced by which a termination of hostilities on the part of the Govern ment misht be brouzht about. In other respects there is but little feeling shown and the President seems to intimate that arbitrary power is placed within his hands for another four years and it shall be his purpose to exercise it as he may see proper. , ' We deem further comment unneeces sary, as all, reading for themselves, can see the corruption of the Administration and make such criticisms as tcey . may think just. : ( .. , THE WAR. ; .The war news of the past week has been meager. Sherman s reported to have been within 25 miles of Savannah, Georgia, and movine on the city. . We do not believe that he will attack Savan nah, aa it is strongly fortified and well defended, and such an attack would entail so heavy a loss upon his armys would destroy, its efficiency. Thus far, Shubman's has met with very little op- positioa, but wo. have reason to believe that he will have to encounter and defeat a large army Del ore ne eaa reach the coast.,"..Th9 . Confederates have a large number of troops in Georgia, and Sheb- MAN 8 almost undisputed march thas a deep significance. ' He is certainly in- a very critical situation, and may be,, with his entire army, "gobbled up." Gen. Grant is expected to attack Richmond soon. We do not believe that the Confederate. Capital can be takeD.v It ias been fortified antil it is now im pregnable. ' Yet the American Butcher will lead thousands' and tens of thousands of brave men into the very jaws of death, as he did in his fruitless attack upon that city last spriD. ': , - ' The Federals claim a victory over the Confederate 'force under Gen. Bates, which attacked Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The number of men murdered is small. 

DUTY OF THE DEMOCRACY. ' Now, that the election is over and the opposition successful, the Democracy must not settle down and think there is no more need of labor. No, there is a mightv work to be done yet. There is a country to 6ave from utter destruction there are streams of. blood flowing from the hearts ' of American, citizens that must be stopped ; there is a murderous civil war. existing in our land that is lay ing waste the country, turning its snowy cotton fields, laden with their rich pro-' dugts, into fields of battle and reddened with human gcre ; draining the treasury, exhausting the resouces, spreading deso lation far and wide over oociTprosperous America, ' robbing our homes'lind .work shops, destroying tho peace and happi ness of our firesides and striking terror to the hearts of mqthers'and wives, that must soon be brought to a close, or nil will be lost. There is a Constitution and certain rights that were held sacred by our forefathers, that have been disrespect ed, spurned and trampled ' upon by a ty rannical and corrupt Administration, that must be re-established and protected, if we would have peace, liberty : and inde pendence again smile upon us as in days gone by. All this remains to be done by the . Democracy. It is, then, the duty of Democrats to go boldly and fear lessly xo work, and continue to cpread their peace principles abroad, and like Yallandigham, OtDS, and others, who have felt the 'galling chains of despotism, stand by the right, proclaim the truth aod advocata itho true principles of De mocracy, regardless of bolts and bare, or banishment from the land of your fathers. Stand by your rights. - Proclaim your principles for they 'are the principles that will restore peace, make glad the sorrowful, bring back our sons and broth ers,' and Bare our country from jrretriev able ufn: -f ' r f " " -' " " " " ' - V ' THE ASHLAND UNION, THE "VICTORY AT IBANK- ' Vr.'-'-- iiir :;: Thje Abolition papers have been claim ing a! glorious victory over the Confeder, ates at Franklin, Tennessee. Thia"vio- tory," like many others, turns out to be a disastrous defeat, as,we were informed by. a gentleman who was there at the time of . the bloody fray. He , says, that the battle was terrible and the Federal loss immense. Thus, thousands upon thousands of brave men have been laid low in'death. And for what r To com pel the Southern people to abandon their white man's Government, and submit to Lincoln's Despotism. ! A few more such victories and another draft will be ordered to drag more victims to fill the, depleted ranks of Lincoln's army, . Tbe History of a. Iteslment. A returned soldier gives a history of one of the Connecticut regiments, the 8th. It left the State three : years ago, with 1060 men: has been recruited - to the number of 800 ; and when our informant left, numbered only sixty men and one officer I The number of votes cast from all these Connecticut men, for President, was only twenty ! How many hcunes in the valleys of Connecticut have a vacant chair for the manly forms that have marched to this cruel war !
