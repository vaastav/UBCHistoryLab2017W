The Coming Session of Congress. "Within a few days the annual mes sage of the president of the United j States tv congress will be laid before j the people. Abstracts of the reports j of the heads of departments have been | pretty generally published. The his tory of the operations of the navy in | Mon with the recent war has ; li-. n already told by Secretary Long. ' That <»f the operations of the army has j been v>ld by the report of Secretary : Alger during the past few days. The j activity of these two martial branches | of the service has been so conspicuous duiing the past eight or nine months that the people generally are Informed | up''ii all interesting points involved in | the campaign. The country has passed j i .int of theoretical acceptance of i results; all that can be expected from i of the president is a practi- j cal review of facts already known. 1 Judging from the past policy of Presi- j d( at McKinley, it is fair to assume that he will be just as wavering and lugubrious In his statements as he : Luring hia night across one-half the continent from Washington to Omaha and hack, and that there will c 'legree of hesitancy as to I forceful recommendation and treat ment of the important subjects in volved. Prx Bident McKinley has manifested | a lack of backbone at every point when be has been brought squarely in contact with a question that demand ed prompt executive action calculated to remove uncertainty in the public mind. H' j was vacillating during all the negotiations previous to the war; the reports of the heads of the mili tary departments prove tha-t he was always shrinking in his views as to what should be done in the prosecution or the war; the records of the war de- I partmtnt. associated with the quarter- i master's and commissary, bureaus, re \<al him as an executive trusting j rather t<» chance than to the authority i which he possessed as the commander- I in-chief, and altogether his adminis- i tration l>*-;irs resemblance to one who, ! while compelled to rise to the dignified I performance of duty, prefers rather j t'> seek refuge in a fluke. The president's message, as suggest ed, can throw little in the way of light upon what has already gone before, but it ought to advance considerable knowledge, in view of the entangled condition of affairs in which the coun try finds itself at the present time. The people may expect a beautifully rounded message, but possessed of all the hollowness of an inflated bladder; and that id what they will probably receive. Tlia Central Amsr.can Collapse. The trouble with those Central Amer ican Cederationista was that they went at it in the wrong way. They wasted their time and energy providing for the Herds of a stable government. A stable government in Central America can never be anything but an accident and BO remote a possibility that there Is no need of worrying about it. A federal law governing the prosecution as vagrants of stray visitors from the solar system would be a model of util ity compared with rules for a Central American union in time of peace. The Nikola Tesla of the Nicaragua region Will be some daring genius who will keep the current of affairs from stray ing when the usual Saturday afternoon revolution comes around. That is the crying need of the hour, and because overlooked it the promoters of the Imitation United States found their federation a failure before it had had a chance to get on ..he pay roll. The problem, hoy ever, Is not such a difficult one. A constitution that will recognize the inherent and inalienable right of every citizen of Central America to revolt whenever the idea overtakes him can become the great benefactor of the section. Only a few simple sections are essential. The de tail can ea-sily be worked out, but even if it is not it will make no gfreat dif ference, for the constitutional em broidery will be useful only in time of quiet, and that is bo rare as scarcely to constitute a factor. Central Amer ica can get along nicely with a con stitution something after this style: The term of the president shall cover three eonsecutho days, if Le is assassinated in tlie meantime, the assassin will assume iha functions for the unexpired term. The vice president shall preside over the sessions of the federal diet and be ex-oiii cio the head of all revolutions. In the 1 rent of revolution in any state of the < onfederation. the other states ehatj also fc-tart revolutions. At the end of a v.et>k the faction having won the most victories shall appoint ■ jiic-siucnt and the onion will ciart over again. In the event c. r the president serving out his full term or passing away from natural causes the federation will be dissolved and the component states will resume th;?ir rae sovereignty. This outline can be filled in with a tew articles about taxes and laws and elections as may seem desirable. They are not important anyway. Upon such s; Bftfc and solid basis of constitutional law a. Ctntral American republic might be expected to work for even as long as a month. Barrel Organ Art. Boston is again the pioneer in a great movement for the uplifting of art. The police powers of the Hub are to be exerted for art for art's sake. The humble hand organ and the hilarious hurdy-gurdy are the objects of reform. | The little German band is in it, too. I The cultured ears of Boston In future will not be jarred by the jangling of "sweet bells out o' tune." From now on Boston street music must be played in tune or not played at all. When the policeman on the corner detects a false note in Op. 57, arranged for the barrel organ, there will be trouble, and, if the shading in "The Flying Dutchman" runs too much to high lights when the he nest Teutons perform before the ale j house, the police patrol will be trans t formed Into a band wagon. It is natural that Boston should lead in this reform. In Chicago, when the | Italian impresario is grinding out that i popular melody "My Papa Swings a Cleaver in the Stockyards," it is a small matter if a few false notes min gle in the melody. In New York the street piano man may rattle away at "Billy Bunked a Jay Down in the J Bowery," and if his touch is not all j that it should be in the way of tech nique no one will mind. The street band in Milwaukee can blare out "Beer Is .Xever Dear Down by the Brewery," and no one will detect that the tuba is half a tone sharp. But not so in Bos ton. Boston knows what's what. Where the hurdy-gurdy man's reper toire is confined to Chopin, and the hand organ plays Wagner for popular encores, music is music, and the man who hurrys the time in "Little Emer son Has Eaten the Only Bean" knows just what to expect. Where the street : gamin whistles impromptus in A major or B first sergeant and the hand organ monkey is grounded in thorough bass, false notes are no better than they are at a bank. But even Boston has only made a beginning. There are other things to be reformed before the cultured city can live its life in one long harmony. Not until the tamale man announces his ; wares in chest tone tenor, and the red hot breaks upon the world in basso pi-o fundo will the Back bay rest in peace. When "Fresh fish" sounds in limpid arias and "Glass put in" is set to Wag nerian music; when the trolley cars rattle along to the notes of the inter mezzo and the knife grinder renders symphonies upon his wheel, then life in Boston will be one long sweet sum mer day. Gen. Butterfleld's Colonial Views. There are likely to be many proposi tions forthcoming regarding the best method of treating the new colonies which have been acquired already by the United States, and which are pos sible of acquisition, as the result of the Spanish war. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, of New- York, comes forward with a suggestion that the constitution of the United States will probably have to be so amended as to prohibit admission to the Union as states of these outlying com munities, which are so largely popu lated by a class of people entirely un instructed in our form of government, as well as the real duties of eltizeii [ ship which would devolve upon them. j The social conditions of those who ; represent, as individuals, the element j that would go to the creation of laws • for their own commonwealth govern j merit are not such as entitle them, ac i cording to his views, to the high func i tions of self-government without some national restraint. Gen- Butterfield proves himself to be a thoughtful man in the matter of dealing with this important and most vexing problem. He has, with calm ness and moderation, voiced a con servative sentiment which will doubt less attract much attention when the debates in congress begin. This is a growing climate all the year round. The ice is growing now. All New York artists are now paint ing snow scenes. They can't get any where to paint anything else. Senator Hansbrough is unique. He : is the only United States senator who i ever had to buy his own paper. Death is- one of the cheapest things !to be had in Manila. Thirty-live ci ! garettes can be purchased fur a Cent. The most serious thing about thi3 Philippine business is the fact that it has set the tongues of Senator Chandler and Hannis Taylor to wag ging. There is a great rear for stable gov ernment in Cuba, It isn't likely Cuba v ill get any government above the barnyard variety until its people grow in intellect. Ten thousand sheop are snowbound in Oregon. How many are in the same condition in the streets of New York will not be known until the reports are tabulated. Why doesn't the Minneapolis Journal | break into its own "Home Study Cir cle?" It ha& recently become obvious to everybody that the Journal has a great deal to learn. Having acquired 6,000,000 savages, it would perhaps be the proper thing to withdraw all our missionaries else where and concentrate them In the Philippines and Carolines. A Minneapolis woman has asked a St. Cloud man for $5,000 damages for promising at a summer school to mar ry her. They met seven times. Oughtn't he to have the $5,000. Gen. Lacret, Any Old Place, Cuba- Respected Sir: If you don't want us to cut the first word out of this last re ina-k, please have your post-prandial speeches carefully edited hereafter. Oshkosh's sheriff claims that the re cent strike cost him $5,300. Strikes are plainly too costly for him, but he doesn't know whether it is financilly best for him to stop them or to let them go on. Bog-Ah-Ma-Geshik would be a good man to interview on the acquisition of the Philippines. Volunter-rs for the job of interviewing him will please step forward. Those having Gatling guns preferred. Through the- Door. "So poor old Fleecy Is gone, eh?" "Yes; he did not consult a physician until he was at death 3 door." "And the dot tor pulled him through!" Judge. Au Incredulous Community.

Llnd'a first act should be to turn out the whole ring that ruled and robbed the state since its organization.—Montgomery Messenger. Likes the Humor. In regard to appointments, Gov.-elect Lind la going to adopt the motto. "To the,victors belong the spoils." Again we say, bully for Lind.—Sauk Rapids Free Press. Mr. Lind Appreciates It. Tl.e Minneapolis Times with characteristic generosity and kindness has made Mr. LinJ'g new duties very simple by making hia ap pointments for him. —St. Peter Herald. How About RetnrnlnK Thanks? J. Adam Bede doesn't want any nrayers offered in the legislature halls of Minnesota thU session. No need of prayers this year, J. Adam. Lind Is elected.—Norwood Times. Gov. Lind Has the Last Say. The Twin City Republican dailies have bean making Gov. Llnd's appointments to suit j themselves. The governor may have aonie j thing to say about the matter later on.—Lam berton Star. Not Elected by Mistake. John Lind was not elected by mistake or fraud or deception, but by the people of th© state who are throwing off party slavery and worship. John Lind is all right.—Waieca County Herald. Dockage of Officers. When Mr. Lind takes the governor's chair it is_.expected that among the first things that he will do will be to order a heavy dockage of officers in tifca wheat Inspection depart ment.—Western Guard. Scandinavian Vote. The cry that the Scandinavian vote elected Lind makes us "tired." In Belmont, a solid , Scandinavian town, Euatia got 78 votes and j John Land 3», while in Sioux Valley, that has not a dozen Scandinavians within its borders, I Lind got 56 votes and Eusiis 16. —Jackson Re public. Xelaon's Work for Lind. Senator Knute Nelson delivered forty speeches in the recent voting campaign, and every voting precinct in which he spoke gave John Lind an increased vote over two years ago. This Indicates that the Influence of the little Norwegian king is waning.—Glencoe Enterprise. Wrong Prescription. If some of these Republican papers that are endeavoring to make up a slate for John Lind would only wake up to the idea that this is no matter of theirs at all, it would save them a lot of explaining after Jan. I Perhaps John needs advice, but Republican advice is not quite what the doctor ordered in this case.—Le Sueur Sentinel. Doesn't Woltfer \eed Him f An important question among local Demo crats and supporters of Lind just now is how Washington county will fare in the distribu tion of plums. This city can boast of a can didate for game warden and state librarian and any number of candidates for the Bur veyor generalship, among them J. S. O'Brien, the present incumbent.—Washington County Journal. John Llnd'B Triumph. John Lind gave up his profession and tendered his services to Uncle Sam In the in terest of his country and returned from the front to be tendered the highest position our state could offer. This may look encouraging to Col. Bryan, who started out on a similar journey as Honest John, lmt the result, how ever, can never be the same.—Plalnview NTws. Fonu'ht on State Issues. Mr. Lind very wisely forced needed state issues to the front. The matter of railroad extortions and discriminations, the binding twine robbery of last summer, the warehouse management and the false grading of wheat, our bank failures and the bank examiner's duties, all these and other state matters were proper issues, as every intelligent man knows, in our state canvass.—Waseca County Herald. Cause of Republican Anxiety. A Republican exchange climbs onto the band wagon with the comment that "John Lind is a level-headed man and will make a good governor." That is just the trouble. Lind will in all probability give the state a good administration, and his very success will come dangerously near getting a lot of other fellows into the legislature, state offices and even into the United States senate who are not so level-headed.—-Freeborn County Times. C'litince for n. GiMts, Just before election one of our valued ex changes emphasized these words: "No Re publican who believes in Republican princi ples can vote for John Lind." Assuming that this was so, a careful estimate on the re- I turns forces us to one of three conclusions: I Either that the Republican party in Minne sota is in the minority by fully 20.0C0. or that there are twenty odd thousand Repub licans in Minnesota who do not believe in Re publican jrinciples, or else —or else —our valued exchange was wrong. But how can a Republican newspaper be wrong?— Montevideo Leader. Miuhi Get Tlniberlake's Place. Red Lake county ought to be recognized by Gov. Lind when he comes to making his appointments. No county in the state gave him a better percentage of the total vote — receiving 1,084 to 422 for Eus-tis, a plurality of G62. The Gazette suggests that the Popu lists of the county unite on EL E. Ives for some important position. Mr. Ives made the race for senator against peculiar conditions that would have deterred many another, and his many friends In Red Lake county would like nothing better than to see him reci>g nized by the governor. No other Populist in the county could present better qualifica tions. By reason of practical experience of many years in the Insurance business, would lie be especially fitted for a position in that department.— Red Lake Falls Gazette. A Plain Cane. "I know you have been defeated for con stable," said the candidate's wife, as he crawled in at 2:30 a. m., very quietly. J'l'd like to know what you know about It," he snapped.

There is a good prospect for a renewal of the Schley-Sampson unpleasantness In the rec ommendation of the secretary of the navy that the grades ot qdmiral and vice admiral be revived "to be flUed by such officers as it may be the pleasure of the president, by and with the consent of the senate, to aopolnt." Of course, there will be no doubt as to the ofiicer who will ;be appointed admiral. The victory of Manila bay settled that. But when it comes to the selection of the vine admiral the partisans of Sampson and of Schley will don war paint again and the bat tle will rage in the White house and be con tinued in the sen^ate.-r-Chicago Chronicle. • • * If Mr. McKinley's new flying machine, "Im perialism," coiues up. to his expectations, It will sustain this weight of alien races: Indians 250,000 C'-'ored in America 5,000,000 Chinese in America , 100.0UO Hawaiians ", 100.000 Porto Ricans 750,000 Cubans 1,500,000 Filipinos of various yellow and black breed* 8,000.000 Total 18,700,000 And here at home we have a foreign-born population of European origin, assiniilabla but not yet wholly assimilated, of 9.000.000. For a government which has universal suf frage as one foundation and "consent of the governed" as the other foundation this Is certainly a profoundly interesting 3howing.— New York World. * • • A messenger came tearing up to the White house in '63 and, hurriedly gaining admis sion to Mr. Lincoln, informed him in great excitement that a large wagon train had been surprised a short ways across the Potomac and a brigadier general taken prisoner. "Did they capture the train?" inquired Old Abe. "No, sir, the regiment came up and saved it," answere-d the messenger, "but the gen eral, Mr. President, is a prisoner." "Oh, never mind that," said Lincoln. "I can make a dozen generals in a day, but mi/les cost $300 apiece."—What to Eat. * ■ * The phrase "open door" has been used only with reference to possessions of Eu ropean powers on Asia's east coast. Originat ing in the treaty or "open" ports of China and Japan, the words have been extended to cover ports China leased or surrendered to foreign powers. The term means that In such ports the alien government has imposed no discrimination in tariff or navigation charges, but has treated the imports and ves sels of other cov"tr}*-s just as it has treated its own. In other words, foreign powers hold ing Chinese ports have merely announced that they will keep such ports open just as China has opened certain free ports to the commerce of nations, without discrimination or favor. * * * A lawyer's advertisement la the Arizona Kicker runs thus: Come to Maj. Hopkins to get full satisfac tion. Office over Brown's drug store and office hours from sunrise to sunset. No ob jection to turning out at midnight to do bus iness. I am entitled to practice in every court in Arizona, and I win nine-tenths of my cases. If you want to sue—if you have beeu sued—l am the man to take your case. Em bezzlement, highway robbery, felonious as sault, arson and horse stealing don't amount to shucks if you have a good lawyer behind you. My strong point is weeping as I appeal to the jury, and I seldom fail to clear my man. Out of tlc-ven murder cases in hand last year I cleared nine of the murderers, and would have made a clean sweep If the other two hadn't begged to be hung In order to I get out of the territory. I have at present live libel suits against the Arizona Kicker, and am the only law yer In town whom the editor cannot bull doze. My charges are reasonable, and when I take a case I push It for all it is worth. Having been in jail no less than four time 9 myself, my experience cannot fail to prove of value to my clients. Come early and avoid the rush. * • • Gov.-elect Lind, of Minnesota, who carried a state solidly Republican for forty yeirs for a Democratic-fusion ticket on a persistent, red-hot anM-irnp^ri;-.istie campaign, wou'd be a good man for th^ people who are slating the recent election as a grand sweep for ox pjnsion doctrine to consult.—Boston Record. « * * All of the Thanksgiving day sermons in favor of expansion we cannot praise, but the one preached in Washington by the Rev. Dr. Radcltffe is much to our mind. He showed great ingenuity in hLs rhoce of a text, which i.s always half th.» battle. This was taken from the prohpet Amos, ""Behold, a basket of fruit." This at once made it easy to claim Divine warrant for regarding Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines as so much "fruit" "placed in the basket of Amer ica by the hand of Providence." At the same time it put the preacher neatly in llDe with the president's plaintive question, ""What are we going to do with the fruits of victory?" What but put them to our basket? Some one might say that the Monroe doc trine would prevent us, but Dr. Radclllfe was ready for that wicked objector: "The Monroe doctrine has given way to the Mc- Kinley doctrine, and while the name of Mon roe was great, the name of McKinley will be greater." There have been many doubts what the Monroe doctrine really is, but there need never be any uncertainty, after this, what the McKinley doctrine is. It is, "Let me hold tin? basket and I care not who I shakes the fruit into It."—New York Evening Post. • • • The New York State College of Forestry has at last its 30,000 acre demonstration area of Adirondack forest. The terms of sale arc agreed on, and only a survey delays the for mal turning over of the property. The tract lies in Franklin .county, to the south of Saranac lake, and partly upon the lower slope of Mount Seward. It contains some virgin forest, some from which lumbermen have taken the choice timber, and some from which forest fires have taken all the timber. The college can, therefore, on the start, demonstrate all sidts of forestry, from planting bare tracts to lumbering and getting the !ogs to market. From the Periodical. Horace Greeley—he used to tell the etory himself—once sent a claim to a Western at- I torney for collection, the attorney to keep i half the amount for hi 3 fee. After a time Mr. Grecley received the following note from the lawyer: "Dear Sir: I have succeeded in collectlug my half of that claim. The balance is hope less."—Albany Law Notes. • • • It Is well known that transportation com panies, mere particularly than other employ ers, desire to reduce to the low9st possible minimum the use of intoxicating liquors by their employes, says the Railway Conductor, and it is only justice to the employes of such companies to state that the desires of the employers are warmly seconded by the employes. The principal means adopted to try to la-sen the use of liquors seem to have been "discharge," and the next most generally tried "a change of pay day from Saturday to some other day." One firm doing an extensive cda! handling business in Chicago and in Milwaukee, and paying its men by check on .Tuesdays, shows tha-t for a period of two ninths' in Chicago, &i pet cent of the checks, were cashed in saloons, 34 per cent in groceries, etc., and 2 per cent In banks. In Milwaukee,.for the same period, 57 per cent were cashed in saloons, 43 per cent in groceries, etc. In Milwaukee, 100 per cent of the checks/ paid to Hungarians and Poles were cashed in saloons. ♦ • • THE

Hl3 picture suggests a thief in a fog perhaps, but nothing worse. But that was to be expected. All accounts agree that the assassin of Canovas had a retiring manner. Very retiring, we should say. Santo, Carnot's assassin, was regarded by his acquaintances as engaging in the extreme. Then there was Henry, the Parts bomb, thrower, a man highly educated, intellectual in conversation and aristocratic in appear ance, who had but to smile to fascinate. j Auguste Vaillant, too, who nearly blew up I the French parliament, was described b> those who knew him as apparently shy as a girl, and of a sensibility which, seemingly, however, did not extend to the chamber ot deputies. So it is with this brute. He looks like anything but a fiend. Yet, as already noted, that was to be expected. Anarchists spring from a class that has relapsed. They are the savages of civilization. In their sav agery is their cunning. It is their crimes that startle, not their faces.—Collier's Week ly. EVIDENCE OF FAULTY BALLOT. Agitation for a Ballot Reform Law Gradually Beginning. From the Duluth Herald. The defeat of Justices Mitchell and Canty for re-eleetioa to the supreme court by a ! purely partisan vote, cast with little regard to the qualifications of the candidates for the j important position, has renewed the dlacua i sion whether some new method should be adopted for selecting the supreme court justices. The present plan is unsatisfactory. This is admitted by nearly every person who has given attention to the subject. The mem bers of the bar, who are particularly inter ested in seeing the appellate court composed j of able juri3ts, unite In declaring that the interests of Justice would be promoted by choosing the Judges in some other way. The people generally should be deeply interested in seeing that the best men are given places on the bench. It is conceded, however, that the present method of nominating candidates for the su preme court is not conducive to this result, and that too frequently political reasons are sufficient to prevent the retention of the I ablest members of the court. The cases of I Judge Mitchell and Judge Canty illustrate this fact. Their successors may prove able judges, but tho fact remains that the retire ment of the two Justices named is causing great regret among the members of the bar and others who appreciate their legal knowl edge and ability. But what changp shall be made? In what way should the judges be chosen so as to overcome the objections raised to the present system of choosing them? Various methods are suggested. It is possible that the best method would be to have the judges of the supreme court appointed by the gov ernor, as the justices of the federal supreme court are named by the president. But such ! a change would meet strong opposition. The i people are slow to make elective offices ap pointive. A communication in another column offers the suggestion that the justices of the su preme court hold office for life, and that they be appointed by the judges of the district court, the latter being themselves ineligible to the office. This might be a better plan than leaving the selection to the governor, who might be actuated by political reasons al most exclusively when making such appoint ments; but again, the objection will be raised that it would deprive the people of a direct voice in the selection of the court. However, it is a subject that deserves consideration. The district judges would be more likely to consider legal attainments and judicial fitness rather than political beliefs when making ap pointments to the highest court in the state. TO 

FIGHT ANARCHISTS. Tlie Coiißrt'ss of Anti- Anarchist* Km* in Rome Will Hold Three We-eks* C'ounell of "War. Among the conferences and commissions now in session the most unique and yet the least mentioned is the anti-anarchistic con ference, which is being held in Rome. It | owes us immediate origin to the assassin who struck down the late empress ot Austria. When the delegates of all the European na tions had assembled In the Corsini palace, Nov. 24. a formal organization was effected with Admiral Canevaro, Italian minister of foreign affairs, as president. While the topics to be discussed are known, any detailed information iii regard to the proceedings is hard to get, owing to the severe regulations maintained with reference to admission to the palace. The building is surrounded by soldiers and police, some in uniform and some in citizen's dress. Officers are stationed also in the inside of the palace, and many are on the lookout for suspicious- | j looking characters at the railway station.;, i For £om« reason journalists are debarred ! from the conference, and for this reason the details of the sessions are meager. While the opinion prevails that the c^a gress will not have any practical results, President Canevaro, in welcoming the dele gates for King Humbert, said that there would certainly bo a most happy issue of ' the congress. The following propositions are under discussion: 1. Anarchists are to be regarded as common criminals, not as po litical offenders. 2. The overt and public acts of anarchists are to ba punished as tr.nsgrocsions of the common law. 3. The various nations interested shall at once enact extiadition treaties. 4. All countries should take some measures to suppress the anarchis tic propaganda HI much as possible. 5. An international pottee and detective service for the suppression and prosecution of anarchists shall be organized at ence. Another interesting feature cf the confer ence is the protest submitted to the confer ence by Prince Krapotkin in behalf of the •International id :al Anarchists." In this docu | ment the nihilists maintain that, in spite of the violence committed by Isolated in dividuals, anarchism is a lcgiijma.e doctrine —one which teaches perfect freedom, iiberty untrammeled by licensed authority. The protest closes with a warning to tho con ference of the danger in attempting to sup press the movement. That the conference has heeded the warn ing to some extent at least is shown by the fact that 2.G00 su pected anarchists will be kept under arrest during the congress, which will not hold its final session until Christ mas. Horrors of Chicago \ewipaper Reading. Tho average Chicago youth of today enter tains no real respect for the banker, mer chant, ot capitalist, for he has bean taught by the Chicago trust newspapers that the banker, merchant or capitalist is no better than ho should bs. Tha boy who reads the trust newspapers has become confused in his mind as to the relative value of the terms applied to citizens in general. There is a Jumble in his mind concerning the difference between the capitalist, banker, merchant, politician, and thief. H« cannot tell from what he reads whether there Is in all Chi cago any man or any class of men whose character is worthy of emulation. He learns that all men, and particularly all successful men. are bad. He thinks after a time that to be successful himself he must become as tricky «b4 unscrupulous and dishoMit am the leading men of the city are represented to be, when it serves the purpose of the corrupt newspapers thus to represent them.—Chicago Inter Ocean.
