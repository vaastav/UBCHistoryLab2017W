Congress passed but two bills at its extra session—a poor business for two months’ labor. Sixty-two dead bodies, from the wreck of the steamer “ Huron," have been found on the North Carolina coast and buried. Are there any more tax collectors anxious to see us ? We have just laid iu a full supply of Bowie knives aud Colt's revolvers. Will “ the Eastern Shore law,” as applicable to the election of a United States Senator, be repealed ? Conun drum. If “the Eastern Shore law ” be re pealed, who will get the plum? Sec ond conundrum. The investigation by the Govern ment of the loss of the “ Huron,” recently wrecked off the coast of North Carolina, has developed no facts not already published. It is said that, when Representative Bland read the President’s message, his smile was “ child-like and bland.” Bret Harte’s “ heathen Chinee ” faded into insignificance by comparison. Isn't it about time for our neighbor across the way to blow another blast upon his “ fraud ’’ horn ? Several weeks - have elapsed since we had the pleasure of seeing in his progressive journal a two-column editorial on “ the de facto President.” We hope he will not allow the coli-webs to gather in the trumpet. Slippery Dick ” Connelly, lately of New York City, has just confessed judgment to the city for the small sum of SB, 107,000.15, for money borrowed from its treasury without its consent. “ The Tribune ” suggests that, while it can not be expected that he should re turn the eight millions, he might show bis sorrow by returniugthe fifteen cents. The war in the East proceeds with varying success. No striking victory has been achieved by either of the com batants during the past week, and it is probable that both Turks and Russians will shortly go into Winter quarters to' recuperate and to make preparations for a vigorous Spring campaign. The ques-' tion as to which is “the sick man ” is still an open one. The maddest editor in America is said to be Wash McLean, of the “ Cin cinnati Inquirer.” The cause of the anger is the message of the President. “Joined to his idols,” “captured by the Wall street sharks,” “ traitor to the interests of his own people,” are some of the expressions this model editor indulges in—all because the President refuses to adopt the inflation theories of Ohio lunatics. The Virginia Legislature met, on Wednesday last, and elected as Speaker of the Lower House, the leader of “the debt adjusters." When it is known that “ debt adjusters ” is another name for repudiatiouists, it will be seen of how much value is all the boasted i “ honor of Virginia” and her “ untar-1 wished escutcheon " Time for the Bour bon journals to pitch the “fraud " veil on another key. It is announced, on what seems to be good authority, that Daniel W. Voor hees, “ the tall sycamore of the Wabash,” is preparing to “ spread himself” on the financial question We hope Senators will give him full opportunity, and that the Washington patriots will crowd into the galleries and applaud, to the echo, the glowing rhetoric of the windy states man. It will be a great day for the American eagle. The Prisoners’ Aid Society have is sued a circular, inviting the Sheriffs, States' Attorneys, County Commission ers, Physicians, Superintendents of Alms Houses, Keeper of Jails, and others interested in the matter, to meet in the city of Baltimore, in State Con vention, to consider the tramp nuisance, and to draft a bill to bo presented at the approaching session of the Legis lature to provide for its suppression. Judge Humphreys, of Washington, has decided the habeas corpus case which involved the question whether Senator Patterson should be delivered to the South Carolina authorities on the requi sition of Wade Hampton He decides that the Senator is not “a fugitive from justice,” that he is in Washington iu pursuance of his constitutional duties ami not subject to requisition. In ren dering his judgment he takes occasion to say, what a great many people have long believed, that if the Senator should happen to get into the clutches of Wade Hampton s rifle clubs, bis chances for a fair trial would be slim. It would have been better, perhaps, if that remark, however true, had not fallen from a judge deciding a question of law. Among the things to be done by the Legislature at its next session, the Bal timore “ Gazette ” mentions the follow ing : “Among the subjects which will de mand the attention of the Legislature, at its next session in January, will be the local option law, the militia reor ganization, the condition of the reforma tories and public charities, the exten sion of the limits of the city of Balti more. and the laws for the better pro tection of sheep against destruction liv dogs. Hardly any one of these is, or ought to be, a party question, and we I trust that they will not bo approached in a partisan spirit. As to the local option law, it is not a thing to lie de cided on sentimental or theoretical con siderations. It is no longer an experi ment. It lias been tried with varied results in several parts of tlie country, and it is rather by an inquiry into its practical working elsewhere than by ' arguments that the subject should lie I discussed. The true mode would lie to obtain full reports upon its workings, where it lias been successful, ami whore it (ails to work well, and where it lias been tried and abandoned and why.” j THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. The first annual message of Presi dent Hayes gives ample proof that lie lias not forgotten howto be “ amiably stubborn.” After ail the criticism, fre quently severe and ofttimes unjust, to which he has been subjected, he still adheres to the views expressed and the policy outlined in his inaugural address. He shows no inclination to falter in the course lie has marked out for himself. Upon all the questions that have at tracted the attention of the country since lie became President, lie stands where lie stood on the fourth of March. Considering the attainment of “ national pacification ” of prime importance, he gives the topic tiie place of honor, and dwells with evident satisfaction upon the resuits already achieved by the adoption of what is popularly known as “the Southern policy." However much that policy may have been an tagonized, the bitterest opponent can not deny that the showing lie makes is quite encouraging. “ Political turmoil and turbulence have all disappeared : useful industries have been resumed: public credit in the Southern States lias been greatly strengthened, and the en couraging benefits of a revival of com merce between the sections of the coun try, lately embroiled iu civil war, are fully enjoyed." lie closes this portion of the message with the assuring avowal of his earnest determination to use all tliff power under his control to secure the recognition of the political rights, aud to ensure the personal safety of the colored men of the South. From the question of conciliation, he [lasses to what, in our opiuion, is of equal importance—the financial credit and honor of the nation. Upon this subject, certainly, he speaks with “no uncertain sound.” The credit of lhe nation must be preserved. Our obliga tions must, iu no wise, lie impaired, and any effort to pay the national debt in a depreciated currency must lie re garded simply as a blow aimed at the plighted faith of the whole people. Specie payments should lie resumed as early as practicable. While lie believes iu a silver currency for some purposes, and recommends Congress to provide for “a silver coinage,” he urges upon that body the necessity of “ a firm pro vision exempting the public debt here tofore issued and now outstanding from “payment, either of principal or interest, in anv coinage of less commercial value , - n I than the present gold coinage of the country.” It looks as if he intends to wipe out Bland “ as with a sponge.” Ills position on this whole question of finance must be highly satisfactory to all, except the champions of dishonest money and the thieves who go around under the cloak of repudiation. The President next devotes a short chapter to the Civil Service, and recom mends the resurrection of the civil ser vice commission that was born and buried under tho administration of President Grant. The recent humiliat ing failure of that commission is so fresh in the minds of the people that the project will, probably, obtain but few supporters. The remainder of the message is not of very great interest to the majority . of readers. The country is felicitated ! upon I lie preservation of pence with ail | foreign nations. The Mexican border troubles and the Cuban insurrection, with its effects on American commerce, are briefly referred to, and the message closes with some general remarks upon a variety of topics of minor import ance. Upon the whole it is a state paper not brilliant , but eminently sensible and practical, and places the President in the light of a wise counselor anil a safe , ! Executive. 

BUTLER OF SOUTH CAROLINA. During the recent debate in the Sen ate on the admission of M. C. Butler as a Senator from South Carolina, Gen eral Gordon, speaking in advocacy of Butler's right, dwelt at considerable • length and with strong emphasis upon his (Butler’s) aristocratic birth, and urged in his favor the blue blood that coursed through his veins. Senator Hoar arose and, in reply, said: “It is not a question of the lilood in General . Butler’s veins, the question is as to the blood on his hands.'' The remark was a crushing answer to all the twaddle about noble lineage and aristocratic ancestors, and abruptly brought the Senate back to a consideration of the merits and the character of the man who was knock ing at its doors for admission. It was a question as to the part taken by this man in the infamous massacre of de fenseless prisoners, the butchery of ignorant, helpless negroes at Hamburg in the Summer of 187 G. The evidence that found its way to the North at the time, and the more complete testimony elicited since, point irresistibly to one conclusion. They place this man, who has been admitted to a seat in the U. S. Senate by the combined votes of Democrats and carpet-baggers, in the the light of an instigator of the massa cre and the champion of the active par ticipants in the outrage. No vehement denial, no special pleading can rub out the admissions made at the time and the corroborating circumstances. No sub sequent conduct can atone for his par ticipation in tho infamy. The massa cre was one that was attended by the most barbarous features. It was cruelty of the basest character. It was the per fection of cold, calculating murder. A band of innocent, unoffending negroes, following the instincts of the race, were marching in holiday attire, and with some noisy but harmless demonstrations of joy, through the streets of Hamburg, South Carolina. They were met by sev eral scions ol Southern chivalry who demanded the right of way. The col ored men refused to concede it. The j whites, incensed at what they chose to I consider the presumption of the blacks, ! withdrew, increased their numbers, re-j I turned, fell upon the unarmed proces | sion with savage fury, chased the mem bers fit' it through the streets, captured a number of them, led them out into an open Held, told them to “run for their lives ” and shot them down in cold blood as they ran. And the instigator and the champion of the blistering crime receives, as his reward, a seat in the Senate of America. All honor to the Republicans of the Senate that ihey refused to put a premium upon wanton murder. Onderdonk’s History of Mary land.—We have received a copy of Ouderdonk’s school history of Mary land, which appears to be, with one exception, well written. It is proba bly as near the truth as the political views of the author’s mind would per mit him to make it. While facts are apparently stated with fairness and impartiality, there is an illy-concealed effort apparent to so color the narrative of the war of the rebellion as to lead those who read the book to believe that the rebel sympathizers of that day were right and those who opposed them were wrong. If Mr. Onderdonk had written as impartially of this period of Mary land history as he has done of the period that preceded it, he would have produced a good work. However, this history of Maryland is a great improve ment upon a child's history of the United States that was published some years ago, just after the close of the war, which, for the size of it, probably contained more lies than any other book published before or since, the Arabian Nights not excepted. CONGRESS. SATURDAY. In the Senate, Saturday, Mr. Wadleigb reported from the Committee on Privileges and Elections in favor of seating Mr. Eustis from Louisiana. Mr. Ingalls gave notice that he would present a minority re port. The Deficiency Appriation Bill was reported and passed. A hill for the relief of sufferers from the wreck of tne Huron was presented in both Houses, and passed by the House of Representatives. MONDAY. The special session of the Forty-fifth Congress ended, and its lirst regular session began. Nothing was done in either Senate or House after the commencement of the regular session, except routine business, and the' reception, reading and, and refer ence of President’s Message. The Senate adjourned until Thursday; the House until Tuesday. The Army Appropriation and Naval Deficiency bills were the only measures that became laws during the extra session of Congress. The Paris Exposition and General Deficiency bills, as amended by the Senate, are pending in the House. — The Silver and Anti-Resumption bills are pending in the Senate. All unfinished business will hold its place in the regular session after the expiration of six days. A number of uoniinalions, among them that of General Harlan to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, were con firmed on Thursday, but suspended ou motions to reconsider. None of these motions having been called up for action before the adjournment of the special ses sion, the nominations stand continued, and were officially promulgated on Monday. General Harlan is expected in Washington by Saturday to take his seat iu the Supreme Court. Before the close of the special session, Monday morning, the Senate confirmed William H. Smith as Collector of Customs at Chicago; John W. McCliutock, Marshal for Maryland; Lewis Heyl, of Philadelphia, General Appiaiser of Merchandise; Sidney Perhatn, Appiaiser of Merchandise at Portland, Me.; Wickham Hoffman, of New York, Secretary of Legation at St. Peters burg, and the following Consults: Thomas B.

Monday afteanoon the President sent to the Senate the nominations of John B. Hawley, of Illinois, to be Assistant Secre tary of the Treasury, and Ezra A. Hoyt, of New York, to be Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Mr. Hoyt’s nomination failed to leceive action at the special session.

Bibs were reported from the Judiciary Committee repealing the “iron clad ” and jurors’ oaths, and passed. Mr. Schleicher, of Texes, offered u resolution transferring the consideration of all mat ters relating to the improvement of rivers from the Committee on Commerse to the Committee on Railways and Canals. — Pending discussion of this resolution the House adjourned. WEDNESDAY. In the House of Representatives Mr. Williams, of Alabama, introduced a resolution providing for a recess from the 10th of December to the 10th of January. Mr. Harrison, of Illinois, introduced an income lax bill. The question whether bills and resolutions relating to internal improvements should go to the Committee on Commerce or the Committee on Rail roads and Canals was referred to the Com mittee on Rules. A bill was passed repeal ing existing statutes for the renewal of patents. Its object is to remove certain dead and inoperative laws from the statute hook. • THURSDAY lu the Senate Senators Blaine, Hamlin and Plumb, who had been absent about several weeks, appeared in their scats. After the presentation of hills, Mr. Allison, of lowa, moved to make the silver bill the special order Tor Monday. This was objected to, as the hill to enable Indians to become citizens had been made the order for that day. After a long discussion it was made the special order for Tuesday next. Mr. Matthews introduced a concurrent resolu tion declaring that ail debts of the United States are payable at the option of the United Slates iu silver dollars of grains each. Mr. Chaffee’s resolution re questing the Piesideut to inform the Senate what legal impediment exists to prevent him from executing the laws in regard to the Union Pacific Railroad Com pany and its branches was adopted.— Among the nominations sent iu was that of Thomas ,1.

A note from Nicrosi | intimated that they were “ willing to die ; together,” though why they should do so jis nut stated or surmised. Nicrosi was a | youth of 22. The lady's age is not men | tioned, but she is said to have been pretty. Richmond is excited over the discovery i that $35,000 of Virginia State bonds have j been abstracted from the State Treasurer’s i office after being funded, and funded the ■ second time under the funding act of March I HO, 1871.

The actual value of the ab stracted bonds is about $211,000, and adds that amount to the State debt. The Hon. John 11. Burleigh, ex-member of Congress from the First Maine district, was killed, on Wednesday night, by the carriage in which he was riding falling from the bridge over the Salmon Falls river, a distance of twenty-five feet.

A Time-Honokkd Specific.— The long and successful career of Ur. Wisiiart’s Pine Trek Tar Cordial, as contrasted with the speedy collapse of nostrums de void of efficacy which have from time to lime been puffed into a brief notoriety dur ing the twenty odd years that this cele brated medicene has been sold, affords a proof that the American public continue* to repose its confidence iu deserving arti cles only. The Pike Tree Tar Cordial has long been recognized as the leading specific for Consumption, Bronchitis, Dip theria, Coughs, Colds, Asthma, and all other diseases of the breathing organs. It is, moreover, a certain, speedy, and safe botanic remedy for Dyspepsia, Liver Dis oiders, Urinary Troubles, Scrofulous Affec [ lions, Gravel, Dropsy, Debility, Coustipa | tion, and Female Complaints, Constantly accumulating evidence of an unimpeacha ble character establishes the fact that it not only entirely eradicates the diseases to which it is adapted, but also that its action is remarkably prompt and thorough. The crucial test of experience has demonstrated its reliability in every particular. Sold by all druggists. Principal Depot No. hit! Fil bert street, Philadelphia, Pa. 50. The Great Regulator-Summons' Liver Regulator. —Summer is the season of the year above all others when the system is ' liable to get out of order and severe and dangerous bilious attacks frequently follow. The principal cause of nearly all sickness at this time of the year has its origin in a disordered Liver, the largest organ in the body, w hich if not Regulated iu lime, great suffering, wretchedness and Death will en sue. A little precaution taken iu time iu the shape of a reliable and efficacious Liver Regulator will in most cases prevent illness and fatal consequences. No medicine in modern times lias gained a wider reputation than Simmons’ Liver Regulator manufac tured by J. 11. ZEllin & Go. This justly celebrated medicine Regulates the Liver, promotes digestion, and foililies the sys tem against malarial diseases. I I NE WAD VEU
