Numerous Suggestions and Recom inundations Congressional Rubber TrustFireEtc llei ort of the Secretary or War WASHINGTON December 6In refer ence to the pay department of the array the report of the Secre tary of War says There is a frequent clashing of authority between the War and Treasury Departments in regard to the payments directed by the JI former To the great embarrarsment 4j of the disbursing officer accounts are disallowed The disallowance of pay ments made by and under such I authority works great hardship lo the disbursing officer as on the one hand he is confronted with the charge of dis obedience and on the other of assum ing a liability for which either he or his securities will be held pecuniarily re sponsible In order to prevent this I recommend that the powers of the re spective departments be clearly defined by a legislative act Copious quotations are made from the report of the Chief of Ordnance relat ve to the success of domestic manufac tures in producing highgrade steel t and the advisability of increased ap propriations for the supply of ordnance for experiments with dynamite torpedo guns and those now in progress with shells charged with high explo sives fired by means of gunpowder Including in his report the Secretary r says The result of examinations for promotion under the civil service reg ulations which were applied to the t War Department in May were satisfac tory The total number of clerks ex amined was 1014 of which 963 or 9 per j j per cent were passed t SI renew the recommendations con tained in my previous reports and in i those of my predecessors for the ap pointment of an AssistantSecretary of War and of an Assistant Attorney General to advise and assist in the legal and technical questions which daily occur Attention is called to the fact that the Pacific Coast is destitute of fortifications guns and armament of every description while San Francisco is without a single gun which can be fird with safety with the present 0 charges of powder and modern projectiles jectiles r i Favorable endorsement is also given y to the LieutenantGenerals recom mendation that the present strength of the army be increased by 5000 and particular attention is called to the importance of the increase of the artillery service and also certain changes in the present organization of artillery regiments The tecretary saggests that the number of courtmartial trials can be much reduced if provision be made for the punishment of minor offenses with out summoning a courtmartial as indi cated in the annual report of 1886 The Secretary renews the recommen dation in regard to the enactment of laws for the punishment for civilian witnesses who refuse to testify i for authority to secure the assistance of civilians and police officers in arresting and holding deserters and for a revi sion of the articles of war which have remained unaltered here while in Eng land and elsewhere the military codes have been modified in accordance with the requirements of modern times The Secretary recommends legislation regulating and making uniform the punishment that may be inflicted by court martlals defining the applica tion of the statutes of limitation in the case of deserters and fixing the liability of minors to military jurisdiction after enlistment The report shows the expenditures of the department during tbe fiscal year to amount to 11386165 The estimates for the next fiscal year aggregate 53 388710 against an appropriation for the current year of 31055 302 The increase is caused by the incorporation of esti mates of 22339151 for public works including river and harbor improve ments the expenditures on this account for the current year amounting to only 1308409 The Secretary says The estimates for the military establishments are based on the actual requirements of the r service During recent years the ap nrnnriation for transportation of the army has been inadequate to meet the cost thereof and the failure to appro priate funds for that service has caused much embarrassment The Secretary refers to General Scho fields recommendation that at least oneeighthinch muzzleloading gun with appliances for target practice and one or more breechloading guns and mortars be funrsued each military post with a view to the improvement of ar tilery instruction Touching Geronimo and his fellow captives now confined at Fort Pickens and Mount Vernon barracks the report says that at this time it is a difficult matter to find for them a permanent home and for many reasons it is im possible to return them to Arizona Under existing laws they can not be taken to Indian Territory and ic the northern reservations the climate is too cold for them The report refers briefly to the diffi culty in August last in Colorado be tween the State authorities and Col orows band of Utes and says an effort should be made for restoration of their property to the Indians The report approves of the recom i mendation in General Sheridans re port touching the extension of all pos sible aid by the general government to the nations guards of the different States and suggesting a system of na tional encampments for the State mili tias at the expense of the national gov ernment i JTS only a question of time and a short time too as to when your rheu matism will yield to Hoods Sarsa parilla Try it 1 1 The Harper Trial

fur Europe Fatal Collapse Unique Deputy lUg Suits lu tbe Ioils at Last General AttorteyGonerals Report WASHINGTON December 6The an nuai report of AttorneyGeneral Gar land give3 a fall account of the business of tile Department during the fiscal year The null ber of ordinary suits pending in the Court of Clatus is 1119 involving the sum of 13250000 The number of cases filed under the Bow man act is 1819 involving about 50 000000 rUe petitions filed in the French spoliation cases number 5560 representing 2486 vessels and about 30000000 During the fiscal year 1777 civil suits were terminated 922 judgments were for defendants 703 were dismissed 26 were appealed to the Circuit Court and 24 to tne Supreme Court During the year there were 13907 criminal prose cutions mostly for violations of customs and Internal Revenue laws The AttorneyGeneral calls attention to he suggestions and recommenda tions made in ns last annual report in regard to matters calling for remedial legislation and again urges the neces sity of immediate action thereon Tnese subjects are as follows Fees of marshals in the Territories pay of d ep marshals revision of the rf 1 substitution fiscal for q I iitH > ar protectiontocivil officers i es fees of witnesses and j t T Ttunul procedure perjury in uv District of Columbia 1 iK ru to the confinement and ieatuvii of I nited States prisoners the AttornsyGeneral says that he is more than ever convinced of the abso lute need of a government penttentiary and reformatory He also oils attention to the necessity for additional legislation for restoring and preserving court records and manes an urgent appeal in behalf of certain changes in the judicial system of the country He urges an appropriation for the erection on I ground adjacent to the Department of Justice of suitable building for the ac commodation of the Supreme Court and other courts and commissioners of the United States He also asks that Congress provide for furnishing por traits of judges of the Supreme Court to adorn the chambers of that court Attention is also invited to the neces sity of extending the jurisdiction of the federal courts to crimes committed upon American vessels on the Great Lakes Congress is urged to take some action for the settlement of it The outstanding claims of witnesses and jurors for services during and prior to the year 1885 the AttorneyGeneral says increased the expenses in the service of process and this has been the experience of the department since the passage of the InterState Commerce bill Prior to the passage of that bill marshals were furnished with free transportation over the various lines of railways while in the service of process Since that date howeverno free trans portation is furnished and the railways charge mileage greater than the fees allowed marshals for travel in such serVIce The AttorneyGeneral in closing his report devotes a chapter the consid ration of tho French spoilation act He says The difficulty of the questions involved suggests the necessity of a vigilant and exhaustive judicial investi gation I therefore recommend the mssage of an act amending the act of January 30 1885 which shall confer authority upon the Court of Claims to render judgment in cases provided for by the act instead of reporting their conclusions to Congress as it is now required to do and to grant to either party government or claimant the right to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States From the deci ion of the Court of Claims on suits filed under the act of 1885 it is not probable that either the government or the claimant will find it neccessary to resort ort to appeals in more than a few I cases but as the law stands now no appeal can betaken by either party I 1 Forger Arrested

the Swiss council of state The Cholera Scare An opportunity has been offered to the secular press within the past few days for discussing the probability of cholera becoming epidemic in this city From the present outlook however the argumental pyramid from the sensa tional standpoint has been as usual wrong side up While it is always proper to be on the alert against possi ble danger there is no necessity for any alarm It is wellknown that the cholera germ is distributed primarily by the evacuations of persons affected with the disease and secondarily by contaminated clothing utensils food and water that no amount of filth heat or moisture will propagate the disease without the presence of the specific poison that the disease is not conta gious in the sense of being communic ably in contact and that an intelligent quarantine vigorous sanitary meas ures and thorough sequestration will serve to stamp out even an epidemic of the disease Although the quarantine regulations are not as strict for this port as they might be to prove that quarantine as such is worth anything we have still the comforting assurance that undei the pressure of medical and lay opinion all the other necessary pre cautions are being taken to prevent the spread of the malady New York Ted cat Journal
