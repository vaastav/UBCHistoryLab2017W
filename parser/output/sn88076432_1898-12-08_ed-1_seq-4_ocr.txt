THE time on which the state canvassing board meets was not Dec. 2nd as previously stated, but the secoud Tuesday in December, the 13th iust. The statute desig nates the time and place. CONGRESSIONAL proceedings will possess unusual interest during the coming year. GoTernments are to be provided for our new posses sions and interesting questions growing out of the war will have to be met and actad upon. LAST week's severe blizzard which resulted in such a great loss of life and property in eastern states seemed to centralize its forces at Boston, Mass.

Cfi\alier county the board of state school lands has loaned$15, 350 ou furm mortgages since Jan'y 1st. With the excepticn of Rich land county the amount placed was the largest in the state. The total amount loaned by the board was $115,255, the low rate of interest, only fix per cent, made this source of obtaining money quite popular with the borrower. MOJTET, while running the Set tler, at Bismarck was taking chances every day in the week ef going to jail for criminal libel. On the othei hand, the self-same Moffet on going to the Philippines in command of Cp. A., of the state volunteer militia is place in charge of the old Spanish prison at Man ila. The question presents itself that perhaps Moffet is a better soldier than newspaper man. SENATOR HANSLROUGH and Edi tor Nye settled their little differ ence, regarding the ownership of the Enter-Ocean newspaper plant over at Devils Lake, out of court. It was bringing "Hans" too much noterietv and he virtually allowed Nye to dictate the terms of settle ment. There's nothing like public sei.'M'Dont to fill the position of a pear -, commission when a United Stau-3 Senator is trying to work a blutf on a poor newspaper man. IN the last issue of the Crystal Call was an editorial which argued in favor of making all educational and judicial positions appointive inst^aii of elective. The board of railioad commissioners is another position that Editor Minder argues should be included in the list. It is his opinion that with this added responsibility resting with the state executive greater care would be taken by the people in selecting a fitted man for the gubernatorial chair. This is something that has many good points both for and against and no doubt time will be given for its consideration before the old regime is changed.
