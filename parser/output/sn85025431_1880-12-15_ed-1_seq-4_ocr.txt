(Contifitted from First Page.) The constitution of the United States, sound financial principles, and our best interests, all require that the country should have as its legal tender money both gold and silver coin, of an mtnnsie value, as bullion, equivalent to that which, upon its face, it purports to possess. The constitution, in express terms, tecognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal-tender money. To banish either of these metals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circu liu ng uiwlium of exchange to the disparage­ ment of important interests. The UniteaStates pruds ces more silver than any other coun­ try, and is directly interested in maintaining it hb one of the two precious metals which fur­ nish the coinage of the world. It wilh in my ju ijniu-ut. contribute to this result if Congress vrl repeal so much of existing legislation as qiiiivi tin: coin ee of silver dollars, contain only 412£ gr in* of silver, and in its stead il intliorizc the S^cretsirv of the Treasury to (.••an Hilvt-r ilollnxK of equivalent value as bull­ ion with g' Id dollars. This will defraud no in n. and will be in accordance with familiar precedents Congress, on several occasious, has altered the ratio of value between gold and ml ver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordance with the a:tual ratio of value be­ tween the two metals. In financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations has been found by expe­ rience to diminish the rates of interest which debtors are required to pay. and to increase the facility with whicn money can be obtained for tn^ry legitimate purpose. Our own recent nnttncial history shows how surely money be­ comes abundant whenever confidence in the ex­ act performance of moneyed obligations is es­ tablished. The Secretary of War reports that the ex­ penditures of the War Department for the fis­ cal year ended June 30, 1880, were #39,924, 778.03. Tuo appropriations for this depart nient, for the current fiscal year, amount to $41,993,6311.40. With respect to the army, the Secretary in­ vites attention to the fact that its strength is limited by statute (Section 1,115, Revised Stat­ utes) to not more than 30.000 enlisted men, but that provisos contained in appropriation bills have limited expenditures to the enlistment of but 25,000. It is believed that full legal strength is the least possible force at which the present organization can be maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline and cconomy. While the enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appropriation for pay of the army, the saving made in other respects would be more than an equivalent for Uiis additional outlay, and the efficiency of the nrmy would be largely increased. The rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi river, and the great tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new territory, impose on the military an entire Change of policy. The maintenance of small posts along wagon and stage routes of travel is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selected, of a more substantial character than those heretofore constructed, will be required. Under existing laws, per­ manent buildings cannot be erected without the sanction of Congress, and when sales of military sites and buildings have been author­ ized, the moneys received have reverted to the treasury, and could only become avail­ able through a new appropriation. It is recom­ mended that provision be made, by a general statute, for the s.ile of such abandoned military posts and buildings as are found to be unneces­ sary, and for the application of the proceeds to the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts aro of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed condi­ tion of the country, then- occupation is contin­ ued at great expense and inconvenience, be­ cause they afford the only available shelter for troops. The absence of a large number of officers of the line, in active duty, from their regiments is a serious detriment to the maintenance of the service. The constant demand for small de­ tachments, each of which should be command by a commissioned officer, and the variou details of officers for necessary service awav from their commands, occasions a scarcity in the number required for company duties. With a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law author­ izing the detail of officers from the active list as professors of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities be so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the retired list of the army. Attention is asked to the necessity of pro­ viding by legislation for organizing, arming, and disciplining the active militia of the coun: try, and liberal appropriations are recommended in this belmlf. The reports of the Adjutant General of the army nd the Chief of Ord­ nance touching this subject fully set forth its importance. The report of the officer in charge of educa­ tion in the army shows that there are seventy em ht schools now in operation in the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The .Secretary recommends the enli.itnient of 15' schoolmasters, with Ult­ rank and pay of Commissary Sergeants. Ai: appropriation is needed to supply the Jud^e Advocates of the army with stii.a le libraries, and the Secretary recommends that the corps ut Judj.e Advocates be placed upon thesume foot­ ing as to promotion with the other staff corp o: the army. Under the existing laws th Cure .u of Mili'itrv Jr.-tiee consists of one of ticer.the Judge Advocate General, an I thecorp of Judirt Advocate of el ht officers of tq rank (.M ij.Ts), with a provision that the linn of the corps shall m.in at l'our, when reduced bv casualty or re-ign.,tion to that number. The consolidation ol' the Bureau of Military Justice and the corps of Judge Advocates, upon the same basis with the other staff corps of the army, would lemove an miju3t discrim­ ination against deserving officers, and subserve the tent interests of the service. Especial attention is ashed to the report of the Chief of Engineers upon the condition of our national defenses. From a personal in­ spection of many of the fortifications referred to, the Secretary is able to emphasize the rec­ ommendations made, and to state that their incomplete and defenselels condition is dis­ creditable to the country. While other nations uave been increasing their means for carrying on offensive warfare and attacking mar­ itime cities, we have been dormant in preparation for defense nothing of im­ portance h.is been done toward strengthening and finishing our casemated works since our late civil war, during which the great gang of modern warfare and the heavy armor of modern fortifications and ships came into use among the nations, and our earthworks left, by a sudden failure of appropriations seme years since, in all stages of incomple tion, are now being rapidly destroyed by the elements. The two great rivers of the North Amerioan continent, the Mississippi and the Columbia, have tbeir navig ble waters wholly within the limits of the United States, and are of vast im­ portance to our internal and foreign commerce. The permanency of the important work on the South pass of the Mississippi river seems now to be assured. There has been no failure wlntever in the maintenance of the maximum channel during thesis months ended Aug. 9 last. This experiment has opened a broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement, upon the permanant success of which congratulations may be .exchanged among people abroad and at home, and especially among the communities of the Mi-si-f-ippi valley, whose commercial ex­ changes float in an unobstructed chan­ nel safely to and from the sea. A comprehensive improvement of the Mis­ sissippi and its tributaries is a matter of tran­ scendent importance. These great waterways comprise a system of inland transportation spread like net-work over a large portion of tne United States, and navigable to the extent of many thousands of miles, roducers and consumers alike have a .•ommon interest in snob unequaled facilities for cheap transportation. Geograph­ ically, commercially and politically they are the strongest tie between tne various sections of -he country. These channels of communica­ tion and interchange are the property of the nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters, and the plainest principles of pnblie interest require their intelligent and careful supervision, with a view to thoir protection, improvement, and the enhancement of their usefulness. The channel of the .Columbia river, for a distance of about 100 miles from its mouth, if obstructed by a succession of bars, which oo casion serious delays in navigation, and heav expense for lighterage and towage. A depth of at least twenty feet at low tide should be se­ cured and maintained, to meet the require­ ments of the extensive and growing inland and oaean commerce it subserves. The most urgent need, however, for this great water-way is a permanent improvement of the channel at the mouth of the river. From Columbia river to San Francisco, a dis­ tance of over 600 miles, there is no harbor on our Pacific coast which can be approached dur­ ing stormy weather. An appropriation of $150,000 was made by the Forty-fifth Congress for the commencement of a breakwater and harbor of refuge, to be located at some point between the Straits of Fuca and San Francisco, at which the necessities of oommerce, local and general, will be best accommodated. The amoant appropriated is thought to be quite inadequate for the purpose intended. The cost .of the work, when finished, will be very great, owing to the want of natural advantages for a site at any point on the coast between the designated lim­ its, and it has not been thought to be advisable to undertake the work without a larger appro­ priation. I commend the matter to the atten­ tion of Congress. The completion of the new building for the War Department is urgently needed, and the estimates for continuing its construction are especially recommended. The collections of books, specimens and records constituting the Army Medical Ma seiim and Library are of national importance. The library now contains about 51,800 voiumea and 57,000 pamphlets relating to medicine, surgery and allied topics. The contents of the Army Medical Museum coqsist of 23,000 specimens, and are unique in the com­ pleteness witfc which both military mgw gefy and the diseases of armies are illustrated. Their destruction would be an irreparable loss, not only to the United States, but to the world. There are filed in the Record and Pension Division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records, together with a great quantity of papers, embracing the orig­ in il records of the hospitals of our armies dur­ ing the civil war. Aside from their historical value, these records are daily searched' for evi­ dence needed in the settlement of large num­ bers of pension and other claims, for the pro­ tection of the Government against attempted frauds, as well as for the benefit of honest claim­ ants. These valuable collections are how in a building which is peculiarly exposed to the danger of destruction by fire, it is therefore earnestly recommended that an appropriation be made for a new fire-proof building, ade­ quate for the present needs and reasonable future expansion of these valuable collections. Such a building should be absolutely fire-proof no expenditure for mere architectural display is required. It is believed that a suitable structure can be erected at a cost not to ex­ ceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). Tiie recommendation of the Secretary of the Vavv, that provision be made for the estab­ lishment of some form of civil government for the people of Alaska, is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or property in that Territory, except such as is afforded by the officers of the United States ship James­ town. This vessel was dispatched to Sitka, because of the fear that, without the immediate presence of the national authority, there was impending danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by both white and Indian inhabitants, and the neces­ sity for this method of restraint does not, ih uy opinion, no exist. If, however, the James­ town should be withdrawn, leaving the people, as at present, without the ordinary judicial und administrative authority of organized local government, serious consequences might ensue. The laws provide only for the collection of revenue, the protection of public property, !tnd the transmission of the mails. The prob­ lem is to supply a local rule for a population so scattered and so peculiar in its origin and con­ dition. The natives are reported to be teacha­ ble and self-supporting, and, if properly in­ structed, doubtless would advance rapidly in civilization, and a new factor of prosperity would be added to the national life. I, there­ fore, recommend the requisite legislation upon this subject. The Secretary of the Navy has taken steps toward the establishment of naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Panama, to meet the requirements of our commercial relations with Central and South America, which are rapidly growing in importance. Locations eminently suitab'e, both as regards our uaval purposes and the uses of commerce, have been selected, one on the east side of the isthmus, at Chiriqui Lagoon, in the Carribbean sea, and the other on the Pacifio coast at the Bay of Golfito, The only safe harbors, sufficientiv commodious, on the isthmus are at these points, and the distance between them is less than 100 miies. The report of the Secretary of the Navy con­ cludes with valuable suggestions with respect to tlio building up of our merchant-marine sen-ice, which deserves the favorable consider­ ation of Congress. The report of the Postmaster General exhib­ its the continual growth and the high state of efficiency of the postal service. The operations of no department of the Government, perhaps, represent with greater exactness the increase in population and the business of the country. In 1860 the postal receipts were $8,518,068.40* in 1880 the receipts were $33,315,479.34. Aii the inhabitants of the country are di­ rectly and personally interested in hav­ ing proper mail facilities, and naturally watch the postoffice very closely. This careful oversight on the part of the pecn pie has proved a constant stimulus to improve­ ment. During the past year there was an. in­ crease of 2,134 postoffices, and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, making an addi­ tional annual transportation of 10.804,19i miles. The revenues of the postal service for the en­ suing year are estimated at $38,845,174.10 and •he expenditures at $42,475,922, lea ring a defi­ ciency to be appropriated out of the treasurv of $3,630,757.90. The Universal Postal Union has received the accession of almost all the countries and i-ilonies of the world maintaining organized uostal services, and it is confidently expected tliHt all the other countries and colonies now mtside the Union will soon unite therewith, thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the founders of the Union, of forming, for pur es of international mail communication, single postamerritory embracing the world, vi complete uniformity of postal charges, nd conditions of international exchange, for ill de-cri -ti ns of correspondence. To enable the Uni ed States to do its full share of this srreat work, additional legislation is asked by he Postmaster General, to whose recommen­ dations especial attention is called. The suggestion of the Postmaster General, that it would be wise to encourage, by appropri­ ate legislation, the establishment of Amoncan inies ot' steamers by our own citizens, to carry t'te mails between our own ports and those of Mexico, Central America, South America, and of rr-nspacific countries, is commended to the sen us consideration of Congress. The attention of Congress is also invited to the suggestions of the Posmaster General in ••a^ard to postal savings. Tt is evident that a delay of justice, in many instances oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now necessarily occurs in the Federal courts, which will in this way be remedied. The report of the Secretary of the Interior presents an elaborate account of the operations of that department during the past year. It gives me great pleasure to say that our In&-~ii affairs appear to be in a more hopeful condition now than ever before. The Indians have made gratifying progress in agriculture, herding and mechanical pursuits. Many who were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the Govern­ ment are quietly settling down on farms where they hope to make their permansnt homes, building houses and engaging in the occupa­ tions of civilized life. Tho introduction of the freighting business among them has been re­ markably fruitful of good results, in giving many of them congenial and re­ munerative employment, and in stimulat­ ing their ambition to earn their own support. Their honesty, fidelity, and efficiency as carriers are highly praised. The organiza­ tion of a police force of Indians has been equal­ ly successful in maintaining law and order upon the reservations, and in exercising a wholesome moral influence among the Indians themselves. I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increased, as an inducement to the best class of young men to enter it. Much care and attention has been devoted to the enlargement of educational facilities for the Indians. The means available for this important object have been very inade­ quate. A few additional boarding schools at Indian agencies have been established, and the erection of buildings has been begun for several more, but an increase of the appropriations for this interesting undertaking is greatly needed to accommodate the large number of Indian chil­ dren of school-age. The number offered by their parents from all parts of the country for education in the Government schools is much larger than can be accommodated with the means at present available for that purpose. The number of Indian pupils at tbe Normal School at Hampton, Va., under the direction of Gen. Armstrong, has been tonsiderably in­ creased, and their progress is highly encouraging. The Indian school established by the Interior Department, in 1879, at Car­ lisle, Pa., under the direction of Capt. Pratt, has been equally successful. It has now near­ ly 200 pupils of both sexes, representing a great variety of the tribes east of the Bocky mount­ ains. The pupils in both these institutions re­ ceive not only an elementary English education, but are also instructed in housework, agricult­ ure, and useful mechanical pursuits. A simi­ lar school was established this year at Forest Grove, Ore., for the education of Indian youth on the Pacific coast. In addition to this, thirty-six Indian boyB and girls were selected from the Eastern Cherokees and placed in boarding-schools in North Carolina, where they are to receive an elementary English edu­ cation and training in industrial pursuits. The interest shown by Indian parents, even among the so-called wild tribes, in the education of their children is very gratifying, and gives promise that the results accomplished by the efforts now making will be of lasting benefit The Attorney General recommends the establishment of an intermediate court of errors and appeals. It is recommended that the number of Judges of the Circuit Court in each circuit, with the exception of the Second circuit, should be increased bv the addition of another Judge in the (Second circuit, that two should be added and that an intermediate appellate court should be formed in each circuit, to consist of the Cir­ cuit Judges and the Circuit Justice, and fW. in the event of the absence of either of these Judges the place of the absent Judge should be supplied by the Judge of one of the Dis­ trict Courts in the circuit Such an appellate court could be safely invested with large juris­ diction, and ita decisions wonld satisfy suitors in many cases where appeals would still be al­ lowed to the Supreme Court. Tho expense in­ curred for this intermediate court will require a very moderate increase of the appropriations for the expenses of the Department of Justice. This recommendation is commended to th* careful consideration of Congress. The past year has been unusually free from disturbances among the Indian tribes. An agreement has been made with the Utes, by Which they surrender their large reservation in Colorado in consideration of an annuity, to be paid to them, and agree to settle in severalty on certain lands designated for that purpose, as farmers, holding individual title to their land in fee-simple, inalienable for a certain period. In this way a costly Indian war has been avoided, which, at one time, seemed imminent, and, for the first time in the history of the country, sin Indian nation has given up its tribal existence to be settled in severalty, and to live as individuals under the common protection of the laws of the country. The conduct of the TnJiann through­ out the ooantjty during the past JMT, with but few noteworthy exertions, has been orderly and peaceful. The guerrilla warfare carried on for two years by Victorio and his band of Southern Apaches, has virtually come to an end by the death of that chief and most of bis followers, on Mexican soil. The disturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and his men, who had taken refuge in the British dominions, are also likely to cease. A large majority of his follow­ ers nave surrendered to our military forces, and tbe remainder are apparently in progress of disintegration. I ccncur with the Secretary of the Interior in expressing the earnest hope that Congress will at this session take favorable action on the Lill providing for the allotment of lands on the different reservations in severalty to the Indians, with patents conferring fee simple title inalienable for a certain period, and the eventual disposition of th residue of the reservations, for general settlement, with .the consent and for the benefit of the In­ dians, placing the latter under the equal protection of the laws of the country. This measure, together with a vigorous prosecution of our educational efforts, will work the most important and effective advance toward a solu­ tion of the Indian problem, in preparing th gradual merging of our Indian population to the great body of American citizenship, A large increase is reported in the disposal of public lands for settlement during the past year, which marks the prosperous growth of our agricultural industry, and a vigorous move­ ment of population toward our unoccupied lands. As this movement proceeds the codifi­ cation of our land laws, as well as- proper legis­ lation to regulate the disposition of publio lands, becomes of mere pressing necessity, and I therefore invite the consideration of Congress to tho report and the accompanying draft of a bill, made by the Public Lands Commission, which were communicated by me to Congress at the last session. Early action upon this im­ portant subject is highly desirable. The attention of Congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber-lands, and the rapid and indis­ criminate destruction of otir forests. The Ur­ gent necessity for legislation to this end is now generally recognized. In view of the lawless character of the depredations committed, and the disastrous consequences which will inevita­ bly follow their continuance, legislation has again and again been recommended to arrest the evil, and to preserve for the people of our Western States and Territories the timber need­ ed for domestio and other essential uses. The report of the Director of the Geologi­ cal Survey is a document of unusual interest The consolidation of the various geological and geographical surveys and exploring en­ terprises, each of which has heretofore oper­ ated upon an independent plan, without con­ cert, cannot fail to be of great benefit to all tho.-e industries of the country which de­ pend upon the development of our min. eral resources. The labors of the scien­ tific men, of recognized merit, who com poso the Corps of the Geological Survey, during the first season of their field operations and inquiries, appear to have been very comprehensive, and will soon be communicated to Congress in a number of volumes. The Director of the Survey recom­ mends that the investigations carried on by his bureau, which, so far, have been confined to the so-called public-land States and Terri­ tories, be extended over the entire country, and that the necessary appropriation be made for this purpose. This would be particularly bene­ ficial to the iron, coal and other mining inter­ ests of the Mississippi valley, and of the East­ ern and Southern States. The subject iB com­ mended to the careful consideration of Con­ gress. The Secretary of the Interior asks attention to the want of room in the publio buildings of the capital, now existing and in progress of construction, for the accommodation of the clerical force employed, and of the public records. Necessity has compelled the renting of private buildings in different parts of the city for tho location of public offices, for which a large amount of rent is annually paid, while the separation of offices belonging to the same departments impedes the transac­ tion of current business. The Secre­ tary suggests that the blocks surround­ ing Lafayette Square, on the east, north, and west, be purchased as the sites for new edifices, for the accommodation of the Government of­ fices, leaving the square itself intact and that, if Such buildings were constructed upon a har­ monious plan of architecture, they would add much to the beauty of the national capital, and would, together with the treasury and the new State,Navy,and War Department building, form one of the most imposing groups of public edi­ fices in the world. The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses tbe confident belief that his efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have been encouragingly rewarded. The importance of the results attained have attracted" marked attention at home, and have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own tea, and the manufacture of our own sugar, would make a difference of many millions of dollars annually in the wealth of the nation. The report of the Commissioner asks atten­ tion particularly to the continued prevalence of an infectious and contagious eattlc-disease, known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as cattli--plague, or pleuro-piienmonia. A mild type of this disease, in certain sections of our country, is the occasion of great loss to our farmers, and of serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain, which furnishes a market for most of our live-stock and dressed meats. The valne of neat-cattle exported from the United States for the eight months ended Aug. 31, 1880, was more than twelve million dollars, and nearly double tho value for the same period in 1879, an unexam­ pled increase of export trade. Your early at­ tention is solicited to this important matter. The Commissioner of Education reports a continued increase of public interest in edu­ cational affairs, and that the public schools generally throughout the country are well sus­ tained. Industrial training is attracting de­ served attention, and colleges for instruction, theoretical and practical, in agrif' 'hire and the mechanic arts, including the Government schools recently established for the in­ struction of Indian youth, are gaining steadily in public estimation. The Commis­ sioner asks special attention to the depreda­ tions committed on the lands reserved for the future support of pnblio instruction •nd to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the Territories and in the Southern States. The recommendation here­ tofore made is repeated and urged, that an educational fund be set apart from the net pro­ ceeds of the sales of the pnblie lands annually, the income of which, and the remainder of the net annual proceeds, to be distributed on some satisfactoiy plan to the States and Territories and the District of Columbia. The success of the public schools of the District of Columbia, and the progress made, under the intelligent direction of tne Board of Education and the Superintendent, in sup­ plying tho educational requirements of tbe District, with thoroughly trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying. The acts of yongresB, from time to time, donating public lands to the several 8tates and Territories in aid of educational interests, have proved to be wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit It would seem to bo a matter of simple justice to extend the bene­ fits of this legislation, the wisdom of which hs» been so fully vindicated by experience, to the District of Columbia. I again commend the general interests of the District of Columbia to the favorable consid­ eration of Congress. The affairs of the Dis­ trict, aa shown hy the report of the Commis­ sioners, aro in a very satisfactory condition. In my annual Messages heretofore, and in my special Messages of Dec. 19, 1879,1 have urged upon Congress the necessity of reclaim­ ing the marshes of the Potomac adja­ cent to the capital, and I am constrained by its importance to advert again to the subject These fiats embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impediment to the drainage of the city and se­ riously impair its health. It is believed that, with this substantial improvement of its river front, the capital wonld be in all respects one of the most attractive eities in the world. Aside from ita permanent population, this city is necessarily the {dace of residence of persons from every section of the country, engaged in the pnblio service. Many others reside here temporarily for tho transaction of business with the Government The expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the permanent civiliza­ tion fund at the disposal of the Department of the Interior but tne fund is now so much re dneed that tbe continuance of this beneficial work will in the future depend on specific ap­ propriations by Congress for the purpose, and I venture ts express tne hope that Congress will not permit institutions so fruitful of good re­ sults to perish for want of means for their support On the oontrary, an increase of the number ot schools appears to be highly advis­ able. I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the Commander-in-Chief of our armies during the war for the Union, whose wise, firm, and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains many precedents for the recognition of distin­ guished military merit authorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent serv­ ices to the country. An act of Congress au­ thorizing the appointment of a Captain-Gener­ al of the army, with suitable provisions relat­ ing to compensation, retirement, and other de­ tails, would, in my judgment, be altogether fit­ ting and proper, and wonld be warmly approved by the country, The report of the Secretary of the Navy ex­ hibits the successful and satisfactory manage­ ment of that department during the last fiscal year. The total expenditures for the year were $12,916,639.45, leaving unexpended at the close of the year $2,141,682.23 of tho amount of available appropriations. The appropria­ tions for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1881, are $15,095,061.45 and the total esti­ mates for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1882, are $15,953,851.61. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1, 1880, to Nov. 1,1880, is *5,0*1,$70, It is obvious that the legislation of the last Congress in regard to silver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as a result of that legislation, has failed to produce the effect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force, requiring as it does the coinage of a nominal dollar, which, in reality, is not a dollar, the greater bpComfcs the danger that this country will, be forced to ac­ cept a single inetal as the soie legal standard of valne, ih circulation, ahd this a standard tit less value than it purports to be worth in the recognized money of tne world. It should not be forgotten that the land ac­ quired will probably be worth the cost of re­ deeming it, and that the navigation of the river will be greatly improved. I therefore again in­ vite the attention of Congress to the importance of prompt provision for this much-needed and too-tang-delayed improvement The water supply of the city is inadequate. In addition to the ordinary use thioughout the city the consumption oy Government is necessarily very great in the navy-yard, arsenal, and the various departments, and a large quan­ tity is required for the proper preservation of the numerous parks and the cleansing of sewers. I recommend that this subject receive the ear­ ly attention 6f Congress, and that, in making provision for an increased supply, such means be adopted as will have in view the future growth of the city. Temporary expedients for such a purpose cannot but be wasteful of money, and therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with corresponding facilities for keeping it filled, should, in my judgment, be constructed. I commend again to the attention of Congress the subject of the removal, from their pres­ ent location, of the depots of tho several rail­ roads entering the city and I renew the rec­ ommendations of my former messages in be­ half of the erection of a building for the Con­ gressional Library, the completion of the Washington Monument and of liberal appro­ priations in support of the benevolent, reform­ atory and penal institutions of the District RuTHEBroRD B.
