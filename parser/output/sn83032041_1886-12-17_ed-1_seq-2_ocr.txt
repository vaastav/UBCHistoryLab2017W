This regaid and at tention should be awarded them, nor only because labor Is the capital of oui woikingmen, justly entitled to its share of Government favor, but for the further and not b-ss important reason that th laboring man, surrounded by his family in his humble home, as a consumer, is ,, "T '-"y ... .....

And yet for many of the necessaries and comforts of life, w hich the most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes, and for their implements of husbandry they are obliged to pay a price largely increased bv an unnatural nrolit. which hv tlm action of the Government, is given to the more favored manufacturers. I recom mend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the increasing and un necessary surplus of national income annually accumulating, be released to the people, by an amendment to our own revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give free entrance to such imported ma teiials as by American labor may bo manufactured into marketable commod ities. Nothing can be accomplished, however, in the direct'on of this much needed reform, unless the subject is ap proached in a patriotic spirit of devotion to t he interests of the entire country and ! with a willingness to yield something I for the public good.
