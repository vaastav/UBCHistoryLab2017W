To Secure Vote on Adoption of Re ; port Resolution would Probably ' - go to Some Committee and be Pigeonholed. Washington, Dec. 7 The llallinner Pinchot iiivestigatlnr commitleo after eleven months, wpi, made Its final report to both houses of congress to day. In the opinion of !; .seven Re publican mennbers, the.- majority-of t'.ie committee, iSenrcUry Baillnger "honestly and falCu'ly ' rerformed' his duties of high n'.l e, with an eye single io the pub!" Interest." In tfe opinion of the four Drno::rats, Bal linirer "i'as not been true to the trust reposed in hinr. bs secretary ci I lie Interior, and s'lould be requested by the proper authority to resign. " Both reports, together wfth the in-d-ependent reiiort of Representative Madison (Republican), also adverse to Ballinger, were offered in senate by Senator Nelson and in the house by Representative McCall. Their presentation followed) a meeting of the full committee. The Democratic members, led by Senator Fletpher, of Florida, agreed to this method of getting the reports before congress, after a motion to substitute the min ority report was rejected in the coin- """ee. ; mcner nrsi raisi th Point of order that the committee had ala.ly approved the report t:mt ''bl'fi t Mmneapo 1c on point of view was led by Chairman N'elson. A motion was then made to substi tute the Imoeratic report for 'the report agreed en by th" seven Repub licans. This was voted down, 7 to 5, RprTwmtti f e -Ma .11 Nmattffv.ttfc the Democrats. It was agreed by the committee after the maioiity report had 'been adopted that, all three 1o presented at once in each heuso and printed together. I'nder this arrange ment the dissenting reports wore given ejpir.l standing with the major ity report before tiie two houses. An ord'er for 30,000 copies of the re; o: t was made by the senate. The reports were accepted In both houses without comment. The plan of action to bo followed -by the Demo crats has nrt been determined on. but it is said a resolution will b pre sented to carry the recommendation made for the secretary's removal. An effort will undoubtedly bo n.adc to put the house on record as to Its opinion of the majority reiKirt. Some or the Democratic members o! the house favor demanding consideration or the report at the first opportunity Officials nf Mie interior department declined to make any comment on the majority report. '1 have no comment to make on the report ot the committee", said Secre tary Rallinger. In case the speaker permits the matter . to take its course, it is held hv narllamentarlans that a resolu tion demanding a vote will be neces- saiy. such a resolution vwum unve . ..... .....n i .. to go to some standing committee for report. As no such committee woulil relish the responsibility the resolu tion wouhl probably be pigeonholed. The general feling is that there will be no action on the report at this ses slon, which tneanB not at all, for the ,. . . I 1 1 n.
