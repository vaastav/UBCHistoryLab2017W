In Cincinnati, Ohio, there Is one saloon to everj so roters. Ohio U very stal wart republican state. The prohibitionists have decided to hold their national convention on the first Mon day in June, 1888, at IndlanapolU. Indiana. At the late election In . Atlanta there were 3285 colored voters registered, of whom less than 600 voted for prohibition It should he borne in mind that Christ mas and New Yean will fall on Sunday this year. But what ladles In Albany will receive New Year's calla.and on what day will the calls be received ? We suggest Saturday. What do you say ? It has been definitely deiermlnsd by the managers of the O. P. railroad net to build a branch to Salem. The connection now made by the O. P. with the O. & C. and the O. P. boats that will ply on the Wil lamette river will be sufficient for the needs of Salem. Jay Gould.who Is now traveling In Eu rope, has been Interviewed in France and eapreees the opinion that the late election in New York practically settles the re- nomination and re-election of President Cleveland. We believe the democratic Congress will pass a bill to revise the tariff and re duce the surplus revenue In the treasury, and that the republican Senate may defeat the measure. If such should be the case, an issue would thus be presented upon which the next presidential election would be fought. We would have no fears of the result of such an issue. The democrats would sweep the country. There is no doubt that a very large ma jority of the voters of Oregon favor a ma terial reduction of customs duties in order to reduce the treasury surplus. A meat urc of this kind will soon be introduced into Congress. Will Mr. Hermann truly represent his people, or will he cling to the fossilized, monopolistic protectionists of the East. Let oppressed farmers keep an eye on Hermann. All letters brought to anv Postoffice half an hour before the time for the de narture of the mail shall be forwarded therein ; but at offices where, In the opin ion of the Postmaster General, more time for making up the mail is required, he w m m may prescribe accordingly, not exceeed Ingone hour. Revised Statutes, Sec. 3S40. The Rogue River . onrier, in its issue of Dec. 2nd, uses the following heading for its Washington news : "The Tariff. A Definite Plan of Seduc Una to be Submitted." The sentence of the Court is that the compositor and proof-reader of the Courier be required to distribute one bushel of pin wKmmsassmmm The Supreme Court of the United States has rendered a decision on the cases grow ing out of the prohibitory laws of Kansas and Iowa, holding that a state has the power to pass and enforce such laws with out being liable for compensation for such property as might be rendered valueless by virtue of the passage and enforcement of such laws. This is an important vic tory for the prohibitionists, as had the de cision been otherwise it would have very materially weakened the voting strength of that party, on account of a necessary in crease of taxation to compensate owners of property that had been rendered value less bv such laws. A 

TRUE FRIEND OF LABOR WORDS OF WISDOM If anything were needed to show that Mr. Carlisle is a true friend of Iabor,and a wise counselor as well, the following ex tract from his speech made in Congress last Monday, on the occasion of his elec Hon for the third time as Speaker, would fully supply the needed proof : "It must be evident to everyone who has taken a partial survey of public affairs that the time has now come when revision of the revenue laws and reduction of taxa tion are absolutely necessary in order to prevent a large and dangerous accumula tion of money in the treasury. The finan cial condition of the government and the private busincs of the people alike de mand prompt consideration of these sub jects, and speedy enactment of some sub stantial measure of relief. "Unfortunately wc are menanced by dangers, from opposite directions. While a policy of non-action must inevitably re sult, sooner or later, in serious injury to the country, -we cannot be unmindful of the fact that hasty and inconsiderate legis lation on subjects more or less affecting large financial and industrial interests might produce, temporarily at least, dis turbance and embarrassments which a more prudent course would entirely avoid. Investments made and labor employed in numerous and valuable industries which have grown up under our present system of taxation ought not to be rudely disturb ed by sudden and radical changes in the policy to which they have adjusted them selves ; but the just demands of an over taxed people and the obvious requirements of the financial situation cannot be entire ly ignored without seriously imperiling much greater and more widely extended interests than any that could possibly be injuriously affected by moderatejand rea sonable reduction of duties. "No part of our people are more imme diately or vitally interested in the contin uance of financial prosperity than those who labor for wage. Upon them and their families must always fall the most disastrous consequence of a monetary crisis, and they too are always the last to realize the benefit of reaction to a pros perous condition. Their wages are always the first to fall when the crisis comes and the last to rise when it passes away. Our effort should be to afford the necessary re lief to all, without injury to the interests of any, and therefore that course of legis lation should be pursued which will guar antee the laboring people of the country against the paralyzing effects of a general and prolonged financial depression, and at the same time not interfere wiih their steady employment, nor deprive them of any part of the just rewards of their toil If this can be done, and I believe it can, if our deliberations are conducted with the wisdom and patriotism which the gravity of the situation demands, this, congress will have cause to congratulate itself on an achievement which promises peace and prosperity to the country for many years to come. " "These remarks may be considered somewhat out of the usual course, and per haps not entirely pertinent to the occa sion : but I believe you will excuse them. ".. ... . . Prior to the establishment of mail ser vice on the Narrow Gauge railroad from Woodburn to Coburg.the mail service be- ween Lebanon and Albany consisted of a daily mall carried by stage, making a round trip each way. The service was- very at- s factory to the people and very few com plaints were made. When the service was established on the Narrow Gange from Woodburn to Coburg.the dally service by stage between Albany and Lebanon was ordered discontinued, and Lebanon was ordered to be supplied by a daily stage service from Sp ice r,a point on the Narrow Gauge about six miles from Lebanon. Now, mall deposited in the Albany post- office for Lebanon Is sent on the O. Si C. railroad to Woodburn, about forty or fifty miles from Albany. From thence It is sent on the Narrow Gauge railroad to Spicer, and as before stated by stage from Spicer to Lebanon. It requires two to three days to get a letter from Albany to Lebanon or from Lebanon to Albany Business men whose Interests would suffer by such uncertainties and delays are com pelted to resort to Welle Fargo & Co's ex rs, who have a service on the line of the Lebanon Branch of the (). & U. that makes two trips a day between Albany and Lebanon. The newspapers In this city are carried to Lebanon by express in stead of by mail In order that they may reach subscribers in reasonable time. This causes considerable extrrfVxpense to thoee who are thus compelled to use the express instead of tha mail. Petitions have been sent to the postoffice department at Wash ington asking that a daily mail service be tween Albany and Lebanon be established on the O. & C. railroad, and in case this Is not done, then that the old star route ser vice by daily stage be restored. Seeing that the public interest demanded the granting of these petitions, the editor of the Democrat addressed a letter to Hon J. H. Mltchell.oneof our Senators it Wash ington, asking him to lend a helping hand to secure this much needed change in the mail service. Senator Mitchell replies as follows : Washington.D. C.,Nov. 35th,i9&7. T. J. Stites. Bditor State Right Democrat, Albany, Oregon. My Dear Sir : I am In receipt this morning of your communication of 18th Inst, relative to the unsatisfactory condi tion of th mall service between' Albany and Lebanon. It will give me great pleas ure to see that this matter has m v personal attention. I rightly understand, however, the difficulties with which we have to con tend here at this time. When service was put on the Narrow Guage, Mr. Knott,and Asst. Postmaster General, Immediately cut off all cross-service In the Willamette Valley for instance from Albany, Jeffer son and Salem, east, as well as some other minor routes, and he seems determined to not reinstate it. Since rny arrival here within the past week I have had a confer ence with him, urging the re-establishment of the service between Salem and Macleay, a distance of 7 miles. He ! not yet acted upon it and teems to hesitate. I think I had better not make a move in the Albany-Lebanon matter until vour Following Is the official vote in the re cent State election as canvassed on Thurs day of last vivek 1 Baksr mo Benton MO Clackamas mo I'latSop .... 4H Culumbls . ., m coot n Crook :w Curry 19 Potttflu MO Ol'Haat its Ui ant 4U-.
