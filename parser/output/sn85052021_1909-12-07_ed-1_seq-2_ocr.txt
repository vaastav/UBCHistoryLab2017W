Il h The Interior Journal. K. C. WALTON We see from an Interview given out by Congressman Harvey Helm on his return to Washington that he will In troduce bills for the erection of public buildings at the following towns in his district: Shelbyville, Lancaster nnd Harrodsburg, running from $100,000 for Shelbyville to smaller appropriations for the other two named towns. As the Lancaster postofllce receipts are not as large as Stanford's by several thousand dollars, and Stanford's about the same as Harrodsburg, tho Interior Jour NAL would liko to know if Stanford, the home of CongressmanlHelm, Is not a part of tho Eighth Congressional dis trict and entitled to fair consideration at that gentleman's hands from a pub lic building standpoint? We are for tho upbuilding of Stanford and for tho betterment of Lincoln count and we propose In the future, as well as in the past, to continue to preach that doc trine to the best people that God ever let the sun shine upon. We have plen ty of beautiful sites, especially the old Seminary grounds on"Main Street, to locate a handsome structure upon, which in the days to come we can point to with pardonablo pride and which would put a loyal constituency under lasting obligations to the one who caus ed it to be erccted'in one of the best towns on the map and splendid officials officials to occupyj it. When Senator James B. McCreary, of Richmond, was in Congress, among other of his good traits, was the fact that ho was ever loyal to his home people first, which endeared him to their hearts always. He had placed in that beautiful city a public building at a cost of $125,000 or more and it willfever be a monument to his memory when he has crossed over the river to restjunder the shade of the trees. We would like to know why Stanford- is not deserving of a beautiful publicbullding that would, in evary way, be commensurate with our little city, her High School building and the handsome new $35,000 court-house, which is now nearlng completion. We wo lid not pluck from the brows of any of the above towns any laurels they de serve, but we would crown Stanford with that wreath of gold she is so just ly entitled tojwear. How about it, Mr. Congressman? In his annual report Secretary of Ag ricuiture Wllsonjshows how the con- iu tier has beenlgouged by the meat sellers, but hisstatement was unneces sary in face of the fact that Armour & Co. alone made a gross profit for tho year of $10,582,000 on a capital stock of $2),000,000.and a net dividend of 35 per cent. The packers' committee recent lymade the statement that the packer being obliged to pay a higher price for live stock passed on the additional cost to the dealer, who inlturn shifted it to the consumer. Even this fails to ac count for the increase in two years of $5 a barrel formessbenf. The concern that makes 35 per'rent. off its patrons can only do so byjthe rankest extortion What's the matter withjgiving the beef trust a tisto of the Standard Oil medi cine? Kentucky is noted forjother things besides blue grass'land, 'pretty women and fast hones. She leadslall tho oth er States in tobacco growing, producing more than one-third of the crop of this country and one-ninth of the entire crop of the world. Some tobacco is pro duced in almost everyllState, but less than one per cent, of 'the country's crop Is grown west of the Mississippi river. Texas is the only trans-Mississippi State in which the industry hasgained much importance. Thclargest)crop of to bacco ever raised was 'this'year. More than 50,000,000 pounds ofcigar tobacco and four times that quantity of other kinds of tobacco is the estimate of the axriculturalTdepartment. A Washington dispatch says that Attorney Lewis L. Walker, of Lancas ter, has been agreed on for district at torney of thelEasterndistrict of Ken' tucky, and that Sawyer Smith, of Bar bourtille, will be his assistant. We ob ject to the latterrproposition seriously, as we want to seeillon. George M. Da vison, of thisplace, retain his present position. Hisrecord in office has been clean andlhe is In every way fitted for the place. We hope the Department of Justice will retain the clever assistant district attorney from Lincoln county. Kentucky ranks third in the list of Internal Revenue payments with Illi nois first and New York second. In tho total of $246,212,719.22 Kentucky contributed $28,130,420.31, which is only J400.000 less than New York. There was a decrease of over five and a half millions In the revenue due In large measuro to the prohibition move ment. Deer production also decreased while the tax on tobacco largely in creased, showing that peoplo must have stimulants of some kind, at least they seem to think so. A New York multi-millionaire gave the man whq saved him from drown ing, $5,000. In this valuation of him self, tho gentleman displays little of the characteristics of Harry K. Thaw, who was decided by the court to suffer from an aggravated case of exaggerat ed ago. Tire family residence at Washington of John G. Carlisle, Secretary of. the Treasury under Cleveland. Whs at tached by an United States marshal for a claim of $2,385 for diamonds and other jewelry. The Itemized list In cludes a three-stone diamond ring and a soltaire diamond valued at $1,200, another diamond ring $500, a ruby and diamond ring $200, another diamond ring $275, gold and diamond links $150 and a string of gold beads $60. The question naturally arises what did Mr. Carlisle want with so much jewel ry and why with his salary then and large law practico since he doesn't pay for It? Fearino a trade war with Canada some of tho leading Congressmen will try to havo the tariff on wood pulp and print paper modified as soon as Congress meets. If tho law-makers had been as sensible as they seem to have been anxious to put a tariff on knowledge they would have obviated the danger in the first place. Senator R. L. Huddle will intro duce a bill In the next Legislature, tak ing Casey county out of the 11th dis trict and putting It In the 8th district, thereby giving the gallant and fight ing democrats of Casey a chance to be factors in Kentucky politics. It is n good bill and we hope the Senator will be able to pass it. The farmer is nearly always inde pendent, but this year each one of them is a king. Secretary Wilson in his an nual report, says that this year's crop Is worth $8,760,000,000, a gain over 1908 of $869,000,000. Everything the farmer has to sell is in demand at higher prices than ever. Who wouldn't be a farmer if he could ? The Louisville Herald has reduced to one cent a copy, a decided innovation in newspaperdom at the Fall City. A pa per like the Herald can not be produc ed for a cent and it Is foolish to sell It at that price. We have heard of no one kicking on the price of newspapers. They are certainly cheap enough now. In Missouri a pistol "toter" was sentenced to two years in tho peni tentiary, under the new law making it a felony to carry one. That is a pretty stringent law, but when it is considered that most men who carry pistols have murder in their hearts it is not too severe. A St. Louis jury broke the will of a millionaire because It was proved that he took five drinks before making it. Unless he was mighty used to it, we should say as a matter of fact that he was not capable of proper distribution of so much money. 'We have just made a pleasant dis covery. Fifty-three pay days in 1910," says the Louisville Times. This is evi dently from the hired editor's stand point. The boss is certainly not going in raptures over it. Gertrude Atherton. the novelist, says she would rather go t" hell than to Chicago. It would doubtless be the same to her if Christ should come and order all to the lower place who belong there. Armour & Co. earned $7,126,924 net on its $20,000,000 capital stock during the year closed Nov. 1, a profit of 33 per cent. No wonder meat sums are high and still advancing. President Taft's message to Con gress, which convened yesterday, lorms perhaps the most vital and Interesting source of news in the United States during the present week. A school for husbands with a course in hooking dresses up the back is pro posed. It might be a good idea if the masculine fingers could be made not to act as nil thumbs. Cranderries are the cheapest things on the market. Thoso who can not af ford turkey can make a show at a part of the necessaries at any rate. A New York man got an injunction against his wife for incessant talking over the telephone. Most husbands would do the same thing If they dared to. 

POLITICAL. Senator W. 0. Coleman, of Henry county, has withdrawn from the race for prison commisioner. Gov. John F, Shafrotb, of Colorado, in a speech at New York before the Equal Franchise League, said woman suffrage has proved a success in Colo rado and predicted that it would be come universal in the United States. Representative Itansdell, of Louisi ana, president of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress, which meets at Washington next Wednesday, conferred with thePresIdent about the speech the Chief Executive will make upon tho opening of the Congress. R. L. McCormlck, the richest man In Tacoma, Wash , wants to succeed Senator Piles, as he prides himself on being a self-made man and on the fact that he never has had on a necktie. Those are two points against blm. The self-made man is too often proud of the job and tho other claim makes him All the bill of what Sut Loving. hood would call a natural born darn fool.
