Bee PRESIDENT'SMESSAGE PRESENTED TO BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS MONDAY. He Talks of Currency Reform, Spain and Cuba, Hawaiian Annexation, the Blmetalllst Envoys, Inter national Arbitration, Etc. r Washington, Dec. 6. Today at noon, simultaneously, both Houses of Congress were called to order. The opening ceremonits were of the usual routine character. The galleries were crowded with spectators. The follow ing is a synopsis of TIIE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE It gives me pleasure to greet the Fifty-fifth Congress in regular ses sion, many of whose Senators and Representatives I have been associated with in legislative service. The meet ing occurs under felicitious circum stances, justifying sincere congratula tions and calling for grateful acknowl edgement to a benincent Providence, which has signally prospered us as a nation. Praise God that peace with all nations continues unbroken. The public questions which most engross us are lifted .above partiz tasbip. The qutstionsof foreign policy, revenue, tne soundness and inviolability of our national currency obligation, and the improvement of the public service ap peal earnestly to individual conscien ces. THE 

CURRENCY QUESTION. The tariff question having been set tled at the extra session of Congress, the currency question is the next most pressing We should not hesitate to enter upon a revision which will make demand obligations less onerous and relieve the financial laws from ambiguity and doubt. The evils of the present system are found to be a great cost to the government in main taining the parity of different forms of money. We cannot be heedless of this burden, which is expensive and a dangerous menace to the National credit. We have nine hundred millions of dollars Jwhich the Government. by solemn enactment, has undertaken to keep at par with gold while the government is without any fixed gold revenue. There has been no deficit requiring the issuance of bonds, but if the gold reserve falls below a hun dred million dollars how will it be re plenished except by selling bonds? I earnestly recommend that when the receipts of the Government are suffi cient to pay expenses the United States notes presented for redemtion ne set apart and be only paid out. in exchange rcr gold. If they are put out in any omer way tney may return again to be followed by another bond issue to redeem them, another interest bearing debt to redeem a non-interest bearing debt. I concur with the Sec retary of the Treasury that the circu lating not es of National banks secured by bonds be reduced to one-half of one per cent, per year. I also join him in recomending that authority be given for the establishment of National banks wit,h a minimum capital of twenty-five thousand dollars, which will enable smaller villages, in agri cultural regions, to be supplied with currency needs. 

SPAIN AND CUBA. N The most important problem the government is called upoD to deal with, pertaining to our foreign relations, concerns our duty towards Spain and the Cuban insurrection. The story of Cuba has been one of unresting effort towards the larger enjoyment of lib erty and 6elf control, of organized re sistance to the method of the mother country, of ineffectual settlement fol lowed by revolt. Instructions given our new Minister to Spain before his departure were to impress upon Spain the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid towards ending the war in.Cuba by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable alike to Spain and Cuba. It was stated that at this juncture our gov ernment was constraned seriously to Interference if the time was not ripe when Spain of her own volition and moved by her own interests and every sentiment of humanity, should not put a stop to the destructive war, and make a proposition of settlement hon orable to herself and to Cuba. It was charged that as a neighboring nation, with large interests in Cuba, we could only be required to wait a reasonable time for the mother country to estab Jish its authority and secure peace; that we could not contemplate an in definite period for the accomplishment of this result. The President then referred to the reforms instituted by the Sagasta government and argued that Spain should be given a reasonable chance to realize our expectations and to prove the assured effect of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably committed. He refers to removal of Weyler,- ''the brutal com mander who inflamed Americans and shocked the civilized world." The President gives assurance that the rights of Americans will be protected and that the government will abate none of its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies an end of the Cuban war. 

HAWAII ANNEXATION. Briefly, the President advocates the annexation of Hawaii and enjoins that self rule be accorded Hawaiian subjects. BLMETALLIST ENVOYS. The bimetallist envoys appointed to represent the United States have been diligent in their efforts to secure the concurrence and co-operation of European countries for international settlement of the question, but have not been able to secure the agree ment contemplated by their mission. They have not reported finally, as negotiations with foreigh countries are still pending. They believe that doubts raised in certain quarters as to the parity between the metals and kindred questions may yet be solved oy iurtner negotiations. 

INTERNATIONAL ABBITK ATION. International arbitration cannot be omitted from subjects claiming our consideration. The best sentiment of the civilized world is moving in this direction. I concur with the Secre tary of the Navy for appropriation authorizing construction of more battleships on the Pacific coast; also that several torpedo boats be author ized. NATIONAL, QUARANTINE. The recent visitation of yellow lever in many cities and towns throughout the South has resulted in much disturbance of commerce and demonstrated the necessity of such amendment to the quarantine laws as will make the regulations of the na tional quarantine authorities para mount. I recommend that Congress authorize the appointment of a com mission of expert bacteriologists, one from the Marine hospital, one from civil life and one to be a medical officer from the Navy. . ' ALASKA. Alaska demands prompt and early attention. A more thorough govern ment should be established there. PACIFIC RAIL WAT. . The Government should not allow the Kansas Pacific railway to be sold at a price which will yield less than one half the principal of its debts. V: GOVERNMENT EXPENSES. While Congress may not find it an easy task to reduce the expenses of the government it should not encour age their increase. These expenses will, in my judgment, admit of de- crease in many branches without injury to the public service. Its com manding duty is to keep the expenses within the receipts of the government and avoid a deficit. After the message was read both houses of Congress adjourned until tomorrow. COURT PROCEEDINGS. Mlstrlal In Tuttle-Penn Case Busi ness Transacted. The Court Calendar was arranged by the Bar Association to take up the ciyil docket Tuesday, but the crimi nal cases had not all been disposed of. The Grand Jury continued to find true bills and it was not thought that the State docket will be finished before Wednesday. There are 57 cases on the civil docket arranged for trial at this term, besides 27 on the motidn docket. It is hardly probably that half of tbem will be reached. The jury failed to agree in the case of Will Tuttle and Bob Peon, the two negroes charged with assaulting and robbing R. L. Hopper, several nights ago, while Tin his way to the N & W. depot. The case was given to the jury about 5 o'clock Saturday evening and at 10 o'clock Judge Starbuck went to the courthouse and learning that there was no likelihood of a verdict, dis missed the jury and ordered the clerk to make it a triatrial. Eleven jury men, it is understood, were in favor of conviction. Mr. Henry L. Shore, it is eaid, was alone for acquittal. The case may be tried again at this term. Tuttle and Penn were bound over to the next term of court. Judge Starbuck fixed their bonds, which are to be justified, at $300 each. Both defendants are in jail. The friends of Tuttle arc making an eff rt to get up his brnd. Monday 41 cases were variously disposed in Forsyth's Superior Court. Only one of these was submitted to jury. That was State vs. James Flynt, J W. Flynt and Pini;ey Ful ton. The charge was forcible tres pass. It seems that Ceasar Hairston, col., and bis wife and daughter lived on Mr. Jas. Flynt's land last year and certain tobacco raised on shares bad been stored away in old Ceasar's dwelling against the will of Mr. Flynt He carried Mr. J. W. Flynt and Mr. Pinkney Fulton, the latter of Farm er's Warhouse, around there a few weeks ago to look at the tobacco. The action of the wife and daughter of Hairston were such as to arouse the suspicion of Mr. Flynt.and his friends and they insisted upon inspecting cer tain other rooms in tne house, nence t he charge of forcible trespass. The jury rendered a verdict of not guilty Ten cases on Monday's calendar were consolidated with other cases and seven were given a suspension of judg ment on the pay toe tit, or costs. In two gambling cases the de fendants plead guilty and were given 90 days on the county roads. They were John Allison and William Rainey. In other cases the defendants failed to answer and continuances entered. The 6rand Jury Monday disposed of about seventy caes. In the great majority of those cases true bills were returned. Of these forty-nine were against merchants charged with sell ing cigarettes to minors. CIGARETTE CASES TRIED. A number of cigarette cases were disposed of on Tuesday. There were some fifteen submissions by mer chants. Judge Starhuck fined those who had t wo cases $15 and cost; those who had three cases $5 and cost. De fendants in four and more cases were taxed with the cost in each case. FOR ASSAULT. Mr.J.W Bradford was tried Tuesday on charge of making an assault with a deadly weapon on H. Blumenfleld, the man who conducted a wheel of fortune for some time. The case went to the jury at noon, and a verdict of not guilty was rendered about 5 o'clock. CRAWFOBD-COZART MARRIAGE.

IT A Salem Merchant Receives a Letter from Spain That Should be Veri fied Before the Dirt Digging Sets In Marvelous Story. Is there a vast fortune of 550X100 francs in French bank notes bidden away in some secluded dell in the vicinity of Winston-Saleni ? This is a question which is sgitating the minds of several gentlemen in this community just now. A prominent citizen of Salem has just received a letter purporting to be from one ex Captain Juan Basanta, a Cuban Republican, now in prison at Barcelona,Spain, in which he confides to the Salem gentleman that about six months ago while la Winston Salem he bid away the sum of money named above in a strong iron box and prepared a complete topographic plan of tne spot. This waa done with the aid of a metric ribbon. He also enumerated on a separate sheet all the particulars necessary for the loca tion of the spot. This plan, the ribbon and the par ticulars be placed in a secret compart ment in a strong trunk which be has "safely deposited." Captain Basanta proposes to reveal the biding place to the gentleman and give him one third of the fortune pro vided he will become guardian of bis daughter, a lovely girl, yet in her teens, who is now in college at Toledo. Spain, during the Captain's term of 15 years imprisonment, upon which be is soon to enter. The Salem gentleman must first advance the money to pay the voyage of Miss Basanta and the Captain's confident to Salem. The present address of the latter be is to reveal in a letter which the Salem gen tleman is to receive in a very few days. There is also a balance due at the college at Toledo which the Salem man must pay before the girl will be released by the school au thorities. Under the terms of the pro position be is to take Miss Basanta into bis home here in Salem and look after her education and training as he would bis own daughter. Capt. Basanta says that the reason he has selected this gentleman to undertake the great trust is that many Americans have recommended him in the very highest terms The letter is couched in thrilling and cootldence begetting lat guage and withal has a semblance of plausa billty. In explaining bow he came by so vast a fortune the Captain says that almost a year ago he was Captain of a certain Spanish horse regiment but was secretly a member of a Republi can faction plotting for the overthrow of the Spanish Gove-nment. He se cured orders from ine chief of the faction to desert and carry with him 400 000 francs then in the company's coffers. The Republicans gave him an additional 100,000 francs and seut him to America to solicit arms and other munitions of war. Wbiie here the Republican band in Spain had been annihilated and be is therefore now the sole owner of the vast for tune. It was when passing through Sa lem six months ago on his mission of begging arms that he received news of very serious illness of his daughter. She was all that was left him in this world and he resolved to hasten to her bedside at any risk. He dared not start with so enormous a sum of money, hence his resolve to secrete it in tbis locality before starting on the journey. He reached Toledo safe and found bis daughter convalescing: but just as he started to escape to a land oisarety Spanish detectives seized him and he now languishes in prison and must continue so for 15 years. uapt. hfasanta promises the Salem gentleman that he will in a few days send a statement from the governor of the Barceloni prison which will give all the particulars in regard to the law suit against him. In tbis letter be will also disclose the address of his confident, wno it is necessary shall be in Salem before the fortune cau be unearthed. In the meantine the Salem gentle man is awaiting develoDments in de cidedly a dubious frame of mind. 

RKPEAL CIVIL. SERVICE L.AVV. Iiinney Thinks tbe Democrats In Of flee Worse Than Hard. Times. The Raleigh News and Observer of Dec. 3d says: Congressman Ltnney, who has been here this week arguing a case before the Supreme Couit, has now gone to Washington, to get him self In tune to legislate for a great country. He was not in the best of humor while here, this Bull of the Brushes. There are some things that he doesn't like and tbe Democratic officeholder is not tbe least of tbem. "Too many of you blame Democrats are still sucking tbe puolic pap," he said screwing up his face in a knot and then carefully unfolding it and smoothing it out. "I know times are hard and Dnces for farm nroducts are low, and I hope at this season we can get such legislation as will sorter im prove matters, but ding my fiddles if it ain't more necessary to root you Democrats out. "If we don't abolish that civil ser vice humbug I hope at least Congress will have enough sense to modify it." And there are plenty hungry KeDub- licans that will say amen to these sentiments of Col. Romulus Zigzag. Presbyterians at Home Again. Tne Presbyterians Sunday wor shipped in their handsome and newly renovated house of worship. The pastor, Rev. Robt. E.

A BRUTAL W1FK-31UBDKK. Iu Greensboro " Saturdav Nlsrht A Strong Talk of Lyching. One of the most horrible and cold blooded murders ever perpetrated in this State was that at Greensboro Saturday evening when Sonly Ryan, a trifling fugitive from justice, shot and killed his wife because she re fused to turn over to him $11, which she had just collected from her boflrd- era. Mrs. Ryan was passing across the street from her residence to a grocery store to pay a bill wben the brute came suddenly upon her, seized her throat aud demauded the money. Her refusal caused him to draw a nistol and fired two balls into her body. Tbe urst entered her bead and tbe other the breast. Death was almost in stantaneous. Not satibtit-d by this dastaidly deed, .the fiend turned upon his aaugbtr, who was rushing to her mother's rescue and would have shot her but for the appearance of several men running to tiie scene. Tbe wife- murderer disappeared down an alley. Still thirsting lor blood he went to Fiazier's hardware store aud atu niDt ed to bhoot County-Treasurer Uodgen against whom he had a grudge. When captured be said lie had attempted to shoot himself aud ehuwi-d a print of the pistol muzz'e on bis temple. The pistol, he said, failed to fire. A brother of tbe dead wife came upon tbe officers with their prisonei aud would have killed him witt a shotgun, but for the intervention of bystanders, 'i here is much indigna tion among Greensboro cit zees and there is talk of a lynching. There were already three warrants out for Ryan and he was thought to have been in hiding in Randolph coun ty wben he sosuddenly appeared. JUMPED OUT OF A WINDOW.
