I JUSTICE GOULD SMILES' Mr. Ermson Tells of ''Fearful Frown and Terrific Manner." AWED BY DISTRICT ATTORNEY Says He Paced Floor, Trembling, I With Fear. Feeling Like Rat in Trap. Testimony today by William G. Ermson in the patent fraud trial furnished those in Criminal Court No. 1 a pleasant half hour. Mr. Ernison gave his version of how perfectly awful Cnited States Attorney Baker is and how terribly frightened he was when Mr. Baker subjoenad him and brought hint to Washington last spring when the government was about through with the detective work in the case. Every one had a good laugh?including the presiding justice?and the court crier forgot to call for order, because he knew he couldn't get it. Explains Interlineations. Dr. William II. Easton of Scranton. Pa., appeared this morning for the second time during the trial and testified for the defense that the interlineations now appearing in some of the patent papers were 'suggested by him in so far as the subject matter was concerned. That is. after John Ailen Heany, the inventor, had studied and had partially perfected a method for making certain filaments for electric lights. Dr. Easton, so he said, suggested further perfections. Attorney Baker and Attorney Gittings had a lively tilt over the cross-examinalion of Mr. Ermson, an ex-employe of the Heany laboratory Mr. Gittings charged that Mr. Baker had threatened to indict every one who offered "manufactured . lUfIllf, ailU Wt ilL UII IU 5d> JiC WUUiU I cliow who was manufacturing evidence." . lustice Gould stopped the debate when it \ was just beginning to glow with heat. They got at it again a second later and there was a little wordy war, in which Mr. Haker was charged with intimidating the w itness. Mention of Threat. Mr. Gittings said Erntson was subpoenaed in reference to the case now on trial, and then because he would not discuss the case beyond certain limitations J was told by the United States attorney or j tie latter*s representatives that "he would ] have to talk, even if it was necessary to i take him before the grand jury." After some argument the United States attorney offered to show that his reason for putting Ermson on the stand was to show that Ermson had made contradictory statements and that he was biased. Justice Gould said lie regretted to have to go into a side issue of that sort, but as t he United States attorney seemed to desire it the court permitted the cross-examination. Mr. Baker Cross-Examines. Thereupon Mr. Baker questioned Ermrnn regarding testimony he had given before the grand jury in regard to the case. At the close of the cross-examination Mr. Gettings asked if Mr. Baker would give him the notes of the grand jury testimony from which Mr. Baker had been questioning the witness. He received a well rounded, decisive "No!" for an answer. Mr. Gettings asked Mr. Ermson what the United States attorney had told him and how Mr. Baker had acted when Ermson was first examined. "He was very boisterous and indicative. and intimated something about perjury and contempt of court," was tlie reply. Fearful Frown?Terrific Manner. The witness had so much to say about Mr. Baker's fearful frown and simply terrific manner that Justice Gould's hand moved to his mouth to hide a smile that made a merry Christmas countenance of the stern front of justice. Mr. Ermson must have had an unpleasant hour in the United States attorney's office. for he said he and two other persons who had been subpoenaed paced the door of Mr. Baker's anteroom white and trembling with fear and likening themselves to rats In a trap. Substance of Testimony. Mr. Ermson's testimony was to the effect that any contradictory statements he might have made were caused by the fact that his knees quaked and his heart, which was in his throat, interfered with his speech. William K. Bam say, the right-of-way man of the Pennsylvania railroad, and secretary of the Teeter-Heany Company, testified that the interlineations In the patent papers which the government lias < ited as bearing on the charge of fraud were in the papers when the notary's seal was pla.ed thereon. End of Trial in Sight. Jlenry K. Knerdirig, one of the defe.-ujants charged with conspiracy to defraud ti e I. nited States government, was Iirtnea 10 i hp witness stand late this afternoon. Ills testimony will probably lose the defense. and a verdict is expected before next Thursday.

CONSIDERING THE MATTER i Recommendation May Be Made by the President. SIR HORACE PLUNKETT HERE Expresses His Approval of tlie Work of the Country Life Commission. Successor to Knox. Congress may be asked by President Roosevelt to abolish the secret service entirely and put that institution in a bureau of criminal investigation 1o be placed under the Department of Justice. It is known that the President is considering such a recommendation, and this may be part of bis reply to the House's inquiry as to the basis for bis utterances on the secret service in his message to Congress early this month. The plan of the President is to consolidate the various detective bureaus of the government under a single head. This would include the secret service, post office inspectors, whose duty it is to unravel crimes against the postal serv ice; special agents of the internal revenue bureau who handle violations of the internal revenue laws; customs special agents engaged in detecting customs violations; pension examiners and land office agents. It is proposed that one chief have supervision over all, and with districts throughout the country, over which there would be subchlefs. The President's information is that the cent:alization of tins work would save the government thousands of dollars a year and make criminal investigation far more effective than at present. Chief Wilkie himself pointed out the plan to Congress some years ago. The experience of the government has been that the detectives of the different bureaus frequently fall over one another In large cities, when, if they were under one head, the number could be reduced. A secret service man who is sent out on a case often finds that it does not relate to counterfeiting, whereupon he drops It and reports to his chief, who in turn notifies the proper bureau, much valuable time being lost in getting after the criminals. Under one bureau the man sent out on the case would be continued on it, no matter what it related to. The plan of the President would, however, enable the proposed new bureau to Investigate anybody and any subject, even including congressmen. Such a plan would prevent provisions limiting the work in any manner. Indorsed by Sir Horace Plunkett. Sir Horace Plunkett, who has. according to Gifford PInchot, who introduced him to President Roosevelt today, "done more for agriculture than any other man," was one of the Interesting White House callers today. He will be a guest of the President at luncheon tomorrow. Sir Horace Plunkett takes a deep interest in the country life commission that is now at work under direction of President Roosevelt to ascertain what may be done for the uplift of farm life in this country. "I believe this commission will do good work in educating the fanner to improved methods, so that he will be abl?| to do in twelve hours what now takes him fourteen or fifteen, and also in improving the social conditions on the farms," said Sir Horace. "The uninviting features of farm life here and elsewhere are numerous. The hard work of tiie farm, lasting from before sunrise until after sunset, together with the small remuneration, except in rich sections, is most discouraging. Make the social life better and pleasanter and lessen the hard work and drudgery of the farm and the inviting features will far overbalance the uninviting ones." "What is the most profitable line or Irish farm work at this time?" "I believe that dairying and hog raising promise the best field for our people, many of whom are turning their attention that way." Oliver May Be the Man. Representative Bates, who has served in the House from western Pennsylvania longer than any other man from that state, except Representative Dalzell, talked to the President today. Mr. Bates' name has been among those mentioned to succeed Senator Knox, who "will go Into the Taft cabinet. "My friends have kindly brought me j" forward," said Mr. Bates, "hut I am awaiting developments. As I see it now It Is unlikely that 1 will he a candidate. There are some hip and Rood men in the race for the senatorship, and 1 would nut be surprised to see George Oliver win out. lie has for twenty years been a helpful friend to the party, not only by means of his wealth, but of his advice. "He is a man of great ability and line intellect and would take a prominent part among the distinguished men of the upper house." There is a general belief among Pennsylvanians that Oliver will succeed Knox. He is acceptable to the organization. and the probability of a combination between him and Penrose, by which the Pittsburg man will succeed Kiiox and the Philadelphia man succeed himself, is widely recognizeed. Pennsylvania men say that the senatorship will lie what the politicians there speak of as "hand picked," that is, the two senators will he selected in advance by the powers thai be. as Root was in New York, and the legislature will have little to do but confirm the selections. The Lincoln Farm Celebration. Senator MeCreary of Kentucky, who is a member of the commission appointed by the Governor of Kentucky to arrange an elaboatc celebration of Lincoln's birthday upon the Lincoln farm, near Louisville, February 1-, discussed with the President today his visit to Kentucky on that date. The commission will meet in Louisville tomorrow to arrange the full tcrru rr? tJ 1 ??" Not Many Visitors Today. Congressmen wore scarce at the White House today, there being comparatively few visitors from the law-making establishment on Capitol Hill. The President will have a comparatively easy time during the holiday season in respect to callers. but he will be busy preparing his reply to the resolution of the House upon 1 the subject of the secret service. This and some further Information lie is collecting as to tiie Panama canal will keep , him occupied until Congress again as- 1 sernblps. President May Get No Elephants. President Roosevelt was informed today i that if he follows the route which has ! been laid out for him in his African ! hunting expedition he need not expect ! to shoot any elephants. Col. J. W.

If Mr. Roosevelt "meets up" with any elephants. Col. Colenbrander sa d. it would he a matter of luck. Col. Colenbrander is fitting out a hunt- fl< ing and exploring expedition. The expe- i: dltion will cover a period of two years. 111 The President was told by Col.

I Not Going to Pine Knot. |( President and Mrs. Roosevelt will not j go to Pine Knot, their Virginia country, home, for Christmas. If they should take' a notion to run down they will do so In the New Year week. They haven't visited the Virginia place this year. Heretofore they have gone there at least once a year, usually at the Thanksgiving period. It is said that the place will be retained after the President leaves the White House, and that when the President gets back from Africa he will make occasional visits there. 

PEACE WITH ALL THE WORLD KING EDWARDS SPEECH PROROGUING PARLIAMENT. Refers to American Treaty and the Bttle Fleet's Visit to the Australian Colonies. LONDON, December 21.?King Edward today prorogued parliament until the middle of February. The king's speech, after rcfprrlnt' to the visits of President Pal litres of Fram e and the King and Queen of Sweden as further confirming the friendship existing between Great Britain, France and Sweden, said that the rela'tior.s of Great Britain with the other powers continue to remain friendly. Continuing, the king said that several important agreements with foreign governments had been concluded during the past year, which by eliminating the causes of contention must tend toward the consoli- 1 .] datiou of peace. Among these agreements, said tlie king, may he mentioned the P treaties with the United States, one for SI general arbitration and another for the {j regulation of certain questions between ? the United States and Canada. In referring to the Balkan situation the c king sain that there was reasons to hope si that wise and conciliatory counsels would prevail and that an amicable settlement r would be reached with the consent of the signatories of the Berlin treaty.

SPECTACULAR FIRE AT ZEIGLER )r ill JOE LEITER AND WIFE HELP S-j FIGHT MINE BLAZE. in i | i Hundreds of Men Striving to Save the Coal Supply of Great Illinois Field. ZEIGLER, III.. December 21.?With a stubborn fire slowly fighting back hundreds of men who have been ceaselessly at work for days seeking to save the coal supply of the great Zeigler mine, Joe Leiter, Chicago millionaire, and his beautiful young wife have joined forces with the workmen and are personally combating the flames. Early today Leiter and his wife, formerly Miss Juliette Williams of Washington, D. C., were at the scene of the conflict. loiter was leading the workmen with an inspiring energy, while on the fighting line, tired but determined, was his beautiful young wife, serving the almost exhausted men with coffee and sandwiches and encouraging them by her presence. Leiter arrived at Zeigler on a special train, hastily arranged for. Through his presence and that of his wife hope remains for saving the mine. Fire started in the coal beds several days ago. . Gradually the flames have eaten their way forward and what was ; believed to be a matter of small consequence now threatens the destruction or an indefinite amount of wealth-producing mineral and the loss of employment to hundreds. Temporary Hospital Tent. Mrs. Leiter lias hud bandages, medicines, salves, etc., brought from I lie commissary to the mouth of the shaft, and there she has erected a temporary hospital tent. Cots and warm bedding were r- also brought into service, and when a firefighter, singed by the heat, overcome by the smoke or weakened by exhaustion, w;js brought out of the shaft he F" received quick and effective treatment, ill In many cases this was administered t- by Mrs. Letter herself. ' l ? Tiie Zelgler mines are among the most valuable of the Loiter properties. Their ts coal supply is practically limitless, while , - great expense has been incurred in crect. ing homes for the miners and the con"1 strurtion of buildings and the purchase of implements. Since its acquirement, however, the rlS Zeigler property has not been a prosnf porous one for Mr. Loiter. Soon after its purchase he had troubles with organal ized labor, which proved very expensive. ? These troubles had hardly been smoothed . over before the disastrous fire csitne. IJ. It is believed that if the flames are ' checked at the present status the mine cannot be worked for months, and that C- heavy financial loss has already resulted. Assaulted Rival Has Chance to Live.

Report on Bills Fending. In a letter sent today to Senator J. H. i Gallinger, chairman of the Senate District j committee. Commissioner Macfarland | makes the attitude of the Commissioners j plain. The communication is written in ! answer to Senator Gallinger, who wrote i to ask the Commissioners to report their I views on the Burkett and La Follette bills 1 affecting public utility corporations in Washington, recently introduced, i Senator Burkett's bill is designed "to | prevent unlawful discrimination by com! panies or corporations doing business In | the District of Columbia and authorizing ' the interstate commerce commission to ! fix reasonable rates or charges for serv j ice rendered by such companies or corporations." Senator La Follette's measure i? designed "to create a commission to be known as the public utilities commission of the District of Columbia and to prescribe its powers and duties." Attitude of Commissioners. In replying, the Commissioners call attention to the recommendation in their recent annual report to Congress, as follows: "The Commissioners recommend that they be clothed with the powers of a public service commission, so as to effectively supervise the public service corporations of the District of Columbia. Such regulation of public utility corporations is now regarded in all large cities as justified by the valuable franchises given to these corporations, and by the public character of their work and its vital relation to the welfare of the community. "Elsewhere public service commissions have been created to perform this important duty. Here it is not necessary to establish a new organ of go\ernment or to incur the expense of annual salaries for such a purpose. "The Commissioners can take the additional duties without interfering with those which they now perform. The number of corporations to be thus supervised is small, and the number of questions to be settled would not be large, although important. "All that is required is to give the Commissioners additional powers to those which they now have, and authority and money with which to employ experts temporarily when their services are required, which would not be often or for long periods of time."

SUPPLY OF ORES LIMITED Predicts That Forty Years Will Ex haust It in This Country. ; AS TO COST OF PRODUCTION _ Says There Are Honest Differences of Opinion on That Question. Praises Schwab's Innovations. Andrew Carnegie today testified before the House ways and means committee engaged in a study of tariff revision. Naturally. there was the biggest kind of a crowd. All the members of Congress who expect to spend the holidays in Washington seemed to be on hand, and with the exception of Champ Clark of Missouri, all the ways and means members were in their places. There were many ladies among the curious and casual. Mr. Carnegie repeated, in substance the statements contained in a recent magazine article over his signature to the effect that steel products might be placed on the free list without injury to American concerns engaged in the business. Chairman Payne, John Dalzeil and Bourke Cockran vainly endeavored to get out of the Laird of Skiho some figures to support his assertions along this line. He 1 1 ?? * - * * ?<= iiifiuu^rs mat ineir principal trouble was that they couldn't understand the figures given them by Judge Gary and other steel men. Incidentally, he praised Judge Gary, saying that the committee should believe his figures, after making due allowance for the fact that he was an interested party. Deserving a Vote of Thanks. Praising the ability of Charles M. Schwab, Mr. Carnegie said Congress should extend a vote of thanks to Mr. Schwab for his work in improving the methods of stcelmaking in this country. "I never met his equal." said Mr. Carnegie, in speaking of Mr. Schwab, "ai)d when we were partners we were a great team." "That is very apparent," remarked Chairman Payne. Speaking of the testimony of Judge Gary before the committee, Mr. Carnegie said: "You should not place any real value on. the testimony of interested parties. Judge Gary said that the United States 8teel Corporation could stand for a reduction in the tariff on steel, but that the smaller steel manufacturers could not survive with lowered duties. That is like one ?C Aesop's fables. Judge Gary is like the monkey who desired the chestnuts, but wanted the cat to pull them out of the fire." Cost of Steel Production. Mr. Carnegie failed to reply directly ta questions as to whether the cost of producing steel at the present time, aa given by Judge Gary and Mr. Schwab, was correct. "Mr. Schwab's estimate of the present cost is bdsed on entirely different ideas from his estimate on the cost in 1805?," was all that Mr. Carnegie would say. Replying to a question from Mr. Cockran, Mr. Carnegie declared that the removal of the duty on steel would not necessarily affect the price, because Europe could not successfully compete with i the American nroduct. He also said that j if the figures given by former witnesses I were absolutely correct steel stock would be selling far below par. _ Incidentally, Mr. Carnegie, who has known Bourke Cockran for a long time, got mixed up on him today. "Mr. McCormiek," was what he called him once or twice, much to the amusement of the committee and visitors, whereupon Mr. Cockran remarked: "Mr. Carnegie, you have promoted ma to a 'Mac,* whereas 1 think I was intended for an 'O.' " Tells a Scotch Joke. Whereupon Mr. Carnegie told a Scotch joke in real fancy dialect that was too genuine for the Star reporter to record. Mr. Carnegie was not willing to deal in figures. "The more figures you get the more you will be befogged. I don't judge by figures given by interested parties. ' he said at another point in his testimony. "I judge by results." Mr. Carnegie spoke of the difficulties he experienced with directors ignorant of th? steel business. "I gradually bought them out and got men like Schwab around me. and we made the cheapest steel that lias ever been made." "You've been out of steel some time." said Mr. Payne. "Can you tell us where we can get the figures on the present cost of making steel?" "I don't know whether you can get trie figures," was his reply. "If a judge was interested in a cause you wouldn't respect his decision would you?" lie asked, reterring to the steel manufacturers who have appeared before the committee. There was no reply to Mr. Carnegie's question. "Silence in the courtroom." he laughingly remarked. "It's too bad 1 have in submit to be cross-examined and can't get a chance to cross-examine these dignitaries." Exhausting the Iron Ore. Mr. Carnegie asserted that, at the rate at which iron ores are being extracted, the supply would be exhausted in forty years. He based his statement on the best ex-' pert opinion he could obtain, he said. He also said that England would be in the same condition in seven years. Mr. Carnegie was questioned at length regarding the cost of producing steel, but the witness declared that honest men easily could differ on that question. Breaking in upon the Scotch story which Mr. Carnegie related, and in the course of which the witness mentioned : the name or judge uary, air. roraney asked if it was intended to characterize Mr. Gaiy as "a sleek article." "Oh. no," said Mr. Carnegie. "On the contrary, he is a most lovable tnan. It means that he is shrewd. It means that he has a delightful, sweet nature." Opposed to Income Tax. "Would you recommend an income tax to make up the deficit in the revenues'."* Mr. Fordney asked. "I believe," replied Mr. Carnegie deliberately. "with Mr. Gladstone, who fiaa had more experience with the income tax than any man of his day. that an income tax makea a nation of liars. Of all the demoralizing taxes that a nation can Impose upon the people the income tax is the worst." "You agree with Gladstone in that!" Interjected Chairman Payne. . "1 do." the steel magnet replied. . , "So do I," said the chairman. Harm Done by Giving: Money. "If you want to do harm with money give it away to those people who will not strug^e for themselves." was one of thy numerous epigrams brightening Mr. QM* %
