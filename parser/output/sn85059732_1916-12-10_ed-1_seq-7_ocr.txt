ONE CENT IS PROVID * For Local First Class Mail and) a Zone for That of the Second Class. '3Y AC*OClAT*D PRESS) WASHINGTON, Dec. D?One cent postage for local first class mall deliveries and a zone system of rates for second class matter which is expected to greatly Increase the charges for magazines and other periodicals having a nation wide circulation are provided for in the annual postoflice appropriation bill as j virtually completed today, in commit-! tee. The measure carrying approprl- j ations totalling about ?327.000,000 ' probably wil.. he reported to the House next week. Under the one cent postage pro- j vision, uir> rate on jeiiers ana other nin.il matter of the first class, when j deposited in any postoffice, or branch j postoftice or letter box or postofflce | in the delivery district, for delivery witliin the limits of the postoflice. city or rural district, would he cut in half. Radical Change. The zone proposal for handling newspapers and magazines. which now pay a flat rate of one cent a pound, is regarded as one of the most radical changes in postage rates in years. Tt divides the country into eight zones with rate chargeable ranging from one cent for 300 miles to six cents for 1.800 miles or more. The bulk of daily newspapers, the committee believes, will not be affected, because they do not circulate beyond a 300-mile radius. Hard on Catalogues. A-fliong other previsions the bill increases rate? for mail order catalogues from two to eight cents a pound, making them third class matter, instead of parcel post; raises the limitations on promotions of clerks an*, carriers in first and second class postoflices; broadens the post master general's authority to deal with lotteries, drugs and poisons and increases the rural delivery appropriation by $-1,000,000 over the $49,OOo.OOO recommended by Assistant Postmaster General Blakeslee.
