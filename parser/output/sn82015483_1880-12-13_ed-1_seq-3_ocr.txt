CoaKresslomal AVorlt Omly a rew Pri vate Kills Already Passed Tlie Blorga; Resolution to be l,ad Aside Democrats Anxionfs to Pass the Appropriations Resignation of Secretary- Thompson Other Blatters. . "WASHTudTON, Dee. 12.- The first week of Congress has passed witEout the accomplish ment of any public business. A few private bills have been passed in the Senate, and in the Honse the representative body has devo ted the Greater part of the time to talk. The two political parties in the5' House "have succeeded in creating a practical deadlock over the Morgan resolution proposing a joint rule for limiting the electoral votes. The Appropriation committee has reported two of the minor appropriation bills. So much for the first week of the session. It may be that the House will succeed, during the legislative week which begins to-morrow, in escaping from the tangle caused by the action of the Republican joint caucus on the Morgan reso lution. To fight or not to fight is the ques tion presented to the Democrats, and at pres ent it looks very much as though no battle would occur. It is probable that a caucus will be necessary to ascertain the sentiment of the Democratic members regarding the Morgan resolution, if they are to insist up on their rights as a majority to decide what legislation shall be had concerted and harmo- ins action is necessary. If they yield to the demand of the Republicans that the Mor gan resolution shall be thrown into the waste paper basket, they will undoubtedly desire to back down in good form and without unneces sary debate. If it were not for the fact that the present session is such a short-one, and the last one in which the Democrats will be in a majority for at least two years, a desper ate fight would be made on the issue raised by the Republicans. The fear of an extra session, for some inexplicable reason, also seems to be strong upon the Democrats. An other argument which many Democrats are using as an excuse for avoiding a political contest now is the amount of important pub lic business, which is of greater moment to the Democratic interests than -a fight upon a question which possesses no immediate im portance. Mr. Atkins will endeavor to-morrow to coll np the fortifications appropriation bill and pass it. The military academy and pension bills will be ready for action as soon as the fortification bill is disposed of. The re funding bill then came up to contest prece dence with the Morgan resolution, which Judge Bicknell desires to press for immediate ac tion. As the resolution has been decided to be a question of privilege it will take prece dence of the funding bill, and then a dreary debate or a tedious spell of filibustering may be anticipated. Not a few of the Democrats are highly indignant over the policy adopted by the Republicans. Mr. Springer has opin ions which he does not hesitate to express. "What are the Democrats going to do about it ?" asked a National Associated Press representative of the gentleman from Illinois. 1 don't mow," was ine reply, --x can oniy speak for myself. I see no other way for our people to do but to take the resolution in hand, compel an attendance of our members and pass it. I don't think the Re publicans will filibuster against the action of a Democratic quorum. If they do they will find it is a game which two can play. The Republicans will absent themselves to defeat the Morgan resolution, I for one am willing to absent myself next February to prevent the counting of the electoral votes. They maintain that the Vice President has the right to count the votes and declare the re sult. I should like to see that theory carried out when a quorum of one of the houses was absent." The reporter asked if the mandate of the constitution requiring the votes to be counted in the presence of the two houses did not imply that a quorum of the two houses must be present to witness the count. He was also asked if to remain away from a session of Congress at such a time would be in direct violation of the command of the constitution ? . "So far as that is concerned," said Mr. Springer, "I am required by the constitution to attend the sessions of the House every day. Whenever I absent my self without leave, I fail in my constitutional d-ity. To absent myself by refusing to vote when there was a question of a quorum would be unlawful. Now there is the case of Georgia. I will not say whether I would vote to reject the electoral vote of that State because it was not cast on the day prescribed by law or not. I should be pleased, how ever, to see the Vice President decide in the absence of a quorum of a house that the vote should be rejected. I doubt if Mr. Wheeler dare take such a responsibility. It manifestly belongs to the two houses of Con gress. There is no doubt of Garfield's elec tion. .Every one concedes mat tne rule we propose to enact does not apply to the pres ent case. I for one, however, shall not wil lingly consent to allow the Republicans to put an interpretation upon the constitution wnicnwili enaDle vice tresiacns Axinur wj elect a President in 1884. Mr. Atkins, Mr. Blount and other mem bers of the Appropriation committee said to-day that they are not disposed- to debate the Morgan resolution much longer. They say the Republicans are determined andtnere is no use in fighting over it. They will there fore this week demand that some of tne ap propriation bills be taken np. They have no doubt that they can carry their point because the Republicans will vote with them in a body to take up public business. The mo tion to adjourn over from Friday last until Monday was made by Mr. Blount, a member of the Appropriation committee, ana ne re sisted all appeals for Saturday's session for debate only. In this resistance he voiced the sentiments of not only his committee,' but of other members who take no stock in the pending debate and who would like to have it stopped because they regard its con tinuance as a waste of time which might be better employed. Taking the past week as a criterion the outlook is not promising for a business session. Members of both parties donbt whether much will be accomplished other than the passage of the appropriation bills. Mr. Cox, the chairman of the census committee will bring np the apportionment bill as soon as he can get the necessary returns from the census office. Some of the Republicans thought they could make a point by delaying the apportionment until after they could investigate alleged in timidation and bulldozing in the South, but good lawyers in their party like Mr. Robin son, of - Massachusetts, and Mr. Frye, of Maine, have convinced their political brethren that individual intimidation amounts to noth ing in the matter of representation, and that to reduce the number of representatives in a State the; must show that the free will of the people was affected by the State law and not by the individual action." The only point will be whether the Democratic Congress shall make the apportionment. If the Republicans choose to obstruct the measures they can de lay action until they get possession of the House in the next congress. The members who will oppose the apportionment at this session are those who- want an extra ses sion of Congress. To-morrow the States and Territories will be called as usual for bills for reference, after which there must be a call of committees for reports unless two-thirds of the members shall decide otherwise. Motions to suspend the rules cannot be made except upon the first and third Monday of each month. After the call of committees shall have been completed general business will be in order. The Appropriation committee can at once test their strength if they are dis posed to do so by calling up one of tne ap propriation bills reported, -and considering it to the exclusion of the debate on the joint role. The rule is a privileged question, but a ma jority of the House can decide as they did on Friday wnetner tuey will consider it or not. There is no higher privilege than that of the right of a member to his seat, and yet it has Men decided tune and again that a majority of the, House could determine whether they would take np a contested election case. A majority can therefore stop the debate on the joint rule whenever it chooses to do so. The Democrats of the Bouse some days ago decided upon a candidate for postmaster in the place of Mr. Stewart, deceased, but they have not called the matter np because they are not sure that they have majority of members present. : If a vote had been taken last week it is not at all improbable that the candidate named by the Republicans would have been elected. The President declines to be- interviewed on the new shape inter-oceanic canal matters have assumed since the designation of Secre tary Thompson to assume the presidency of the American branch pt the Panama Canal company. Mr. Hayes thinks he has . given the public a pretty good idea of his opinion of the subject in a special message latt spring and m tne recent annual message, lie was not aware to-night that Secretary Thompson bad made public the fact ol nis resignation. It is learned that Secretary Thompson's health has not been good for a few days past, he having been troubled with a succession of headaches. Mr. Thompson said to-day - that he expected to be ready to turn the Navy do partment over to his successor within ten days at the farthest Mr. John W. Hogg, the present chief Clerk of the Navy depart ment, will most likely be appointed to Mr. Thompson's place. Hogg fully understands the plans and policy- of the Secretary and his appointment would insure that these plans would be carried out to the end of President Haves' administration. Mr. Hogg's appoint. ment would be acceptable to the members of the Cabinet. The matter will most probably be settled to-morrow or at the Cabinet meet ing on Tuesday. President Hayes said to night that he had not decided upon a person to succeed Mr. Thompson as Secretary of the Navy. "Commander Jeffries has had charge of the Navy department, I believe," said the President, "whenever Secretary Thompson has been absent. I do not know whether an officer of the navy could accept the appointment of Secretary and retain his position at the same time. I have not exam ined the law on the Bubject. I don't imag ine a commodore would be wining to resign from the navy to accept a Cabinet position for two months." Representative McLane said to-day that the Democrats without the necessity of hold ing a caucus had agreed temporarily to sus pend further efforts to pass the Morgan joint rule and take up instead such public business as is ready for consideration. In anticipation of the arrival ef General Grant in the city at 4 o'clock to-morrow af ternoon the District organization of Boys in Blue have made full preparations to receive and escort him to the residence of Gen. Beale, wnose guest he will be. lo-morrow evening the President will dine him. Senators Conkling, Cameron, Anthony, Burnside and Logan and Representative Morton have also been invited to meet him at dinner later in the week and after consultation with General Grant a date will be fixed when a formal ser enade will be tendered him by the Boys in Blue. On Thursday next General Grant has accepted an invitation to dine with Hon. John B. Alley, and during the week he will visit General Beale s farm near the city and inspect his Arabian horses. General Beale says that while he cannot say how long. Gene ral Grant will remain in Washington, he hopes to induce him to spend ten days or two weeks at the capital. A cable dispatch printed to-day stated that the correspondence printed in London con cerning the fisheries question included docu ments from August, 18 9, to October, ls0. Here only Granville's letter was published. Secretary Evarts, however; stated to the re porter this evening that the -entire corre- pondence on the subject was transmitted to Congress in May last and printed excepting, of course," Granville's letter, which was published last week for the first time. xne sub-committees ot tne Mouse Appro . priation committee were engaged yester day morning upon the District of Columbia and Indian appropriation bills. The consu lar and diplomatic and the military academy, bills will be reported to the full committee on Tuesday next, and it is believed the committee will approve and instruct their chairman to report them to the House the same day. The following is the text of tne letter to the collector of customs at New Xork rela tive to the refunding of the customs duties collected on Miss Sarah Bernhardt's stage wardrobe : Bib Tbe department is in receipt of your letter of the 4th iiiat. , subntitting the appeal of Sarah Bern hardt, an actress, from your assessment of duty on certain dresses and hats intended for her profession al personal wardrobe, which were imported per steamer Amerique, October 27, 1880, the amount of duty so paid being $1,660. The list of articles shows that they conBist of articles specially adapted for cer tain characters represented by Miss Bernhardt in her professional capacity only adapted to stage use, and there seems to be no doubt that they form a part of her professional implements or tools of trade, as rec ognized by a decision of this department dated Oct. 22, 1872, and the general practice wnicn Has ob tained for maay years. Dutyppeara to have been assessed upon the ground that the articles had not been m use prior to tneir importation. J ue provis ion of law contained in the free list which governs the case is as follows : "Wearing apparel in actual use and other personal effects (not merchandise), pro fessional books, implements, instruments and tools of trade, occupation or employment of persons arriving in the United States. The condition of actual use abroad imposed by the statute attaches only to wear ing apparel. This is clearly shown by the structure of the paragraph above quoted. Some of the decis ions of the department cited in your letter upon cer tain articles claimed to be implements or tools of trade had reference to the fact that the articles had been in use abroad, and possibly the free entry was granted upon the strength of this statement. This department, however, is of opinion that its rulings should go no further than the law- in this re spect, and that professional implements like those in question, if reasonable in amount and intended . in good faith for the personal use of the party bringing tham, are entitled to free entry without regard to the question whether they have been in actual use abroad. You will therefore reliquidate the entry free of duty and forward a certified statement for refund of the duty so exacted, amounting to $1,500. Very respectfully, H. F. Fbench, Assistant Secretary.

WORLD. Ireland. Da-vitt's Lubors in America The I, and Question Agitating Eagland Farmers Bloving for Proprietary Rights. London, Dec. 12. Mr. Michael Davitt's recent trip to America and the results which have followed it have given the greatest sat isfaction to prominent and influential mem bers of the Land League. Mr. Parnell shows his appreciation of his lieutenant's efforts by promising more arduous work, and if possi ble a place in the coming conflict in the House of Parliament, as Mr. Davitt's name is down on the books of the League as the next candidate for a Home Rule vacancy. The agitation of the land question is extending to England. At a meeting of the Farmers' Alliance this week a Sussex far mer demanded for members of his class the right to acquire the land they hold after a certain period of tenantry. English landlords are at last beginning to take alarm at the numbers and activity of the organiza tions being formed among small farmers and agricultural laborers for carrying out what is popularly called the "free land pelicy," and we are quite likely to see an agitation in Eng land which will recall the famous reform and anti-corn law movements. Captain Stackpole attempted to sell some horses in Limerick yesterday, but his effort was in vain. A bellman in the employ of the League paraded the streets of the city for hours before the sale, warning every person not to buy the animals, and after waiting for some time afterward for the sale the Cap tain was obliged, in the absence of even one bidder, to have his horses conducted to their stables. Great Britain. Baroness Ceuttst Coming Marriage. London, Dec. 12. Current reports that the marriage of Mr. Ashmead Bartlett and Baron- Burdett-Coutts will ot - take place are wholly unfounded." BaronessBurdett-Coutts' intimate friends say she is fully resolved to complete the' alliance regardless of pecuniary loss. Preparations for moving from her present home, which is the property of the Coutts bank, are already advanced. It is privately hinted that the wedding will occur next week. Baroness Burdett-Coutts lately told a peer that a judicial decision on her money masters may eventually come before him, she being resolved, though indifferent to wealth, to maintain what she believes to be her rights and carry the proceedings to the House of Lords for final decision. It is esti mated that her yearly income after an adverse decision will be $200,000. NEW YORK. Death Prom a Rat's Bite. New Yobk, Dee. 12. Dr. Hackeling sent a certificate of death to the Health Board yes terday, which set forth that a child named John Vidno Kerher, one month and three weeks old, had died from tetanus, produced by the bite of a rat. The father, Jacob Eerner, is the proprietor of a lager beer saloon in the basement of the dwelling. He says that on last Monday, while his wife was cooking din ner, she put the child to bed in a dark room and went out. Its cries drew her back. She took the screaming babe into the-- kitchen, and found that its hands and face were smeared with blood. A physician was called in. He thought the presence of blood was due to hemorrhage from the nose or mouth, and prescribed a powder. The mother on washing the blood stains from the little one discovered two wounds on the little finger of the left hand. Some time- afterward the child was taken with cramps and later became feverish. The injured finger, in the mean time became- swollen.

THE SOUTH. South Carolina. - A Brutal Murder by Hegroea Bloodthirs ty Slaughter or a Young Wife The Murderers Promptly Lynched. . Charleston, Dec. 12. Last Sunday Mr. Thomas Kennedy, living near . Salem, went over to his father's house a short distance from his own house, to ask his mother to stay with his wife during his absence. Mrs. Kennedy Was a young lady of only nineteen or twenty years of age, intelligent, refined and highly respected. When her husband left she shut the door and sat by a window to write a letter to her mother. As she sat there she saw in the yard Joe Barnes, a colord boy, about sixteen years old, who had been c ployed by Mr. Kennedy the previous week, and she asked him to bring her an armful of wood. This boy had been induced by two negroes living near by Vance Brandt and his sister Julia, aged respectively eighteen and fifteen to hang around the premises. and when Mr. Kennedy left'the place to give the signal to Vance and Julia, who kept themselves concealed in a thicket. This couple had' heard of Mr. Kennedy's inten tion to visit Charleston, and, thinking that he would have a good deal of money in the house, determined to break in and get it. When Joe turned to go for the wood he gave the signal and soon met Vance coming into the yard. Vance asked him where Mr. Ken nedy was, and went immediately to the win dow and tnree times tried to get in, and each ume ne was snoved out by mm. Kennedy. r maing mat ne was determined to get in she opened the front door, ran through the yard and was just going through the gate wnen vance snatcned up a hoe lying in the yard, overtook her . at the gate and knocked her down. She implored mercy and told him she would give him all the money she had. if he would onlv spare ner nie. ne cursed her, and said: Ise been waiting to kill you a long time," and at tnat strucK ner two more blows, in attempt ing to avert wnicn it is supposed her hand was broken. Just then Julia came up with another hoe and severed her head. When Mr. Kennedy returned, about three hours afterward, he found his wife lying outside the front sate, mutilated, cold and stiff, her head almost severed in twain. The entire cranium was cut off from ear to ear, leaving toe Drains scattered around on tne ground. A jury of inquest being had returned a ver dict, 'murder ui tne Highest degree by un known hands." Several colored persons were arrested on Monday, but no clew to their guilt being obtained they were prompt ly released. On Tuesday the colored boy, Joe Barnes, was arrested. He showed so much confusion on being questioned as to his whereabouts on Sunday, that only a few questions served to bring out his full confes sion, from which the above account is taken. The horrible character of the murder awak ened intense indignation in the neighborhood, and a crowd of 150 white men and 50 colored men assembled to punish the murderers. A cart was obtained, and halters being placed about the necks of the prisoners and tied to the limb of a tree, the cart was driven from under and the trio were soon dangling in the air, expiating the most cold blooded murder ever committed in this vicinity. FIRE RECORD. A City in Flames The Business Portion Kntirely Destroyed. Pensacola, Fla., Dec. 12. A disastrous fire burned here for eight hours Friday night. Five blocks in the heart of the city were destroyed, involving a loss of over half a million, possibly three-quarters of a million dollars. Palafox street, from Wittich's cor ner to the middle of the block opposite the Plaza, is swept clean. The fire stopped in Government street at the City Hotel, east, and one square back of the Custom House, west. Over one hundred establishments are gone, embracing the main business buildings, and turning out about fifty families from their homes. - The Custom House, postoffice, Merchants' Hotel, Brent's bank, both tele graph offices, both newspaper offices, Dunn's Exchange, Wright's dry goods house, the County Clerk's office, are among the well known buildings burned. The County Clerk, ijarue, for tne nftn time in his term of oihee saved the records ; but while the old hero was doing this his own residence was burned and his family rendered homeless. The main steam fire engine was out of order and had to be repaired by a machinist before it could work. At one time the loss of the railroad depot and adjacent mills seemed in evitable, and locomotives stood all fired up ready to draw the company's equipments and other property out of town. Much suffering must ensue. A Eine Residence Burned Two Persons . Killed. Baltimore, Dec. 12. The handsome dwelling built by J. Strieker Jenking at a cost of $75,000 and occupied by him until his death, considered the finest residence in Baltimore, located on North Charles street in the first square north of the Washington monument, was completely destroyed by fire about 5 o'clock this morning. Charles D. Fisher, of the firm of Gill & Fisher, large dealers in grain, had recently purchased the property for $55,000 and moved into it only about a month ago. The fire is supposed to have originated from a wood mantlepiece and the flames had made so much headway that two colored servants sleeping in the upper part of the house upon being aroused found their escape by the staircase cut off, and al though they were warned not to attempt it they both jumped from the upper window and were botn killed. One was a colored woman and the other a colored boy. Noth ing but the walls of the handsome structure remain. Five Persons Burned to Death. Cincinnati, Dec. 12. A fire in John P. Gay's bucket factory, corner of New and Culvert streets, this city, occurred last night, in which five persons were burned to death. MOVEMENTS OF STEAMERS. New York, Dec. 12. Sailed, the P.

Wall Mtieet, V ' Siv Yoek, Dec. 11, 1880. j The market for railway and miscellaneous stocks has been unsettled and variable, and the fluctuations from day to day have been frequent, but as a rule not very large.
