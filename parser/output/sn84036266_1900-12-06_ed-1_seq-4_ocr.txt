Cf}0 Dupuyer Cîcantfya GEO. W. MAG EE, PUBLISHER. {Published every Thursday at Dupuyer, Mon tana. where it s ontered la the postoffice as second-class matter. DEC. 6, 19<X>. The penitentiary i« becomiß{* depopu lated owing to the free rein giveu by Gov. Smith to his pardoning power. Jividently the governor believes it good <loctrine to "turn the raacals out." Mr. Aguinaldo is reported to have ad opted a diet which will have a tendency to check his pursuit of the halos sur mounting the brows of Washington, IJolh a' and other liberators of the hu man race. A bullet in the stomach is discomforting, even if taken as the or dinary •'high ball', but wnen administered in good military style, from the muzzle of one of Uncle Sam's rifles, it will create -a desire for a quiet and inconspicuous existence. Th j habit o ! che »vin/ g im has baen declared unprofessional conduct by the superintendent ot Choteau county's ■school?, when the gvat is carelessly pick <ed up in the house of a- friend without her spécifié consent, and accordingly the certificate of the offending teacher has been suspended. The controversy is now np to stato superintendent Carleton, who has been appealed to,, and his de cision is awaited with breathless anxiety by those who can see bo cri me in chew ing gum purchased by others. In response to numerous inquiries from our subscribers, we have to «ay that according to our best information that part of the Lewis aud Clarke For est Reserve immediately west of Dupu yer is under tlae.su per vison of a forest ranger, who receives the sum of 885 per month in .exchange for his services for 8 hours each dav in watching for tires, preventing depreciations and keeping an •eye on trespassers generally. If a horse man is seen "hitting the high places," it is but charity to preeusae that it is not a ree Indian, but the forest ranger in eager pursuit of his salary. The decision of the Interior depart ment to keep sheep oiï the Lewis and Clarke forest reserve next summer, causes oneto wonder if the establish ment uf a Cree reservation is contem . plated. The sheepmen pay heavy taxes, and the fa'3t .that they are to be shut out of the reserve, when they only desire to range their sheep on the prairie portion, in no way interfering the preservation of tbe forests, will not increase their respect for a law which fails to rea:;h the tres passes committed by foreign Indians. It is interesting to note the comments of the press, when a great man pays the debt of nature. No matter how persist t'-ntly he is opposed during life, all join in recounting his good qualities when j death steps in. Bitter opposition serves 1 to emphasize the good qualities of a statesman so long as he is successful in overcoming his oppoaents, but the vie- j ious tongue of slander has brought de- j feat to many who have ill deserved it. j Vvould it not be as well to recognize merit during a person's lifetime, this en- ! larging his capacity to do good? Death ; beH repentance is probably effective, ! when sincere, but the vindication and general forgiveness tendered your op- ; ponont after he is gone comes rather late io be of any material service. We would : mit counsel an abuse of the dead, but wo would advise that it is sometimes emin ently proper to let up on the living. The president s message is mainly a reiteration of the recommendations in his last communication to congress, and a careful perusal should convince the •most skeptical that the prêtât adminis- 1 tration is with the people on all import ant issues, including an earnest endeav jw to find a solution to the trust prob lem. Now that the campaign is over and the calamity howlers have torn their whiskers in vajn, it is comforting to re flect that the ship of state is still to be guided by a ekilfull and steady hand, and that four years more of republican rule will satisfactorily settle all the ques tions involved. Admiral M'Nair is Dead Washington, Nov. 28.—Rrtar Admiral Frederick G. McNair died at his resi dence in this city today from a stroke of apoplexy. He had been in poor ^health for many months. Yesterday ho was taken very ill, and today his condition became so critical that his attending physician called into consultation Dr. Stone, one of the naval surgeons, but the admiral slowly sank away. He was the ranking rear admiral of the navy, and tho officer next in line to Admiral Devey. Filipinos Swear Allegiance. Manila, Dec. 3 —Sunday in Vigan was a great day for the American cause 2,200 natives of the region, nearly all fighting rebels, crowded the church and I took the oath of allegiance to the United ! States. The oath was administered by ! the priest. All but 500 of tûose sworn were bolomen. The number included the 1,200 bolomen who had previously surrendered. The proceedings in tha church occu pied the entire day and included an address by Gen. Young and an exhorta tion by the priest, Soa rcely any rebels remain in the vicinity of Santa Maria, Gen. Young attributed this fact to three causes—the re election of President McKinley, the arrival of a stronger body of troops and the especially rigid enforcement of war measures and the deportation of prison: ers to Manila. He reports that it is necessary to occupy all the barracks in order to protect the' natives froai the Tagalog leaders. j 1 State Lands. According to the annual report of State Land Register Harry D. Moore, t he past year has been a banner nue in the history of the state land office, j As a result of the large business done by j the state land office, the public schools ; of the state will this year receive a large I sum of money, reaching nearlv if not I quite §3.per capita. This will be more ] than double the amount received by the i schools in an> previous year, and will be j particularly appreciated by the school j officers, because of the fact that owing j to detective laws, it has not been possi ble to get enough money by taxation to run the schools in some of the districts, According to the report there were 570 : new leases and permits issued during i the fiscal year justciosed, covering 338, j 711 acres, yielJing an annual rental of I £42,767.?4. These, together with the ; leases and permits issued in prior years, ! make a total of 1,912 m existence, which i during the year produced a revenue of ; $144,383.76. There are now a total of ; 1,2(55,895 acres under lease in different ! parts of the state. After allowing for renewals, the net increase in rentals for ; the year just closed amounts to S35,077 .06 over the preceding year.-—Helena In dependent. Congress in Session. Washington, Dec. 2 -The leaders of the house are preparing to press the im i portant business of the short session j which convents tomorrow. Already j considerable preliminary committee j work has been done on the bill for the ! reduction of the war revenue taxes, the army reorganization hill and the river and harbor bill and several other bills, and the legislative mill will start under a full head of steam. The army reorganization bill ia con sidered particularly urgent owing to the possibility of its meeting strenuous op jwsition after it reaches the senate, and the intention of the leaders is to get it out of the way at the first possible mo ment. It will be reported probably on Wednesday, unless after further consid eration it is decided to report the legis lative appropriation bill, which will also be ready on Tuesday. Tne democrats will caucus on the army bill on Monday aud the indications now are that a sub stitute will bo offered by them providing that the prese.it law for a provisional army be extended for two to three years, Tne bill to redu o war revenue taxes has been practically completed by the republican members of the ways and means committee and it will be sub mitted to the full committee on Tues day, unless in the meantime it should be otherwise decided upon. Tomorrow the leaders will probably call a confer ence for the purpose of adjusting and harmonizing differences. The very latest «tyles of Stetson hats at Jos.
