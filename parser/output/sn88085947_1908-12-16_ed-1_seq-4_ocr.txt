Well, the president allowed secret service men to be Used in running down criminals. Among others, a senator Bnd a representative were caught and convicted. They iwere caught robbing the government on whose pay roil they were. They were using the power given them by |he people to rob the people. This was a couple of years ago. So last year congress directed that secret service men limit their activity to tertain matters pertaining to counterfeiting, etc., jind refrain from general activity against any and all crinV inals. The president put two and two together and came to Ihe conclusion that some hitherto uncaught senators and representatives felt nervous over the thought that secret .Service men might be on their trails. So he said in his last message. "If that is what you fire bothered about, just order that secret service men tnust not hunt congressional criminals (if any!), but don't (Continue to forbid them from hunting all criminals." Now congress says it is insulted. Perhaps it is, lint •perhaps" it is merely feeling the twinges of a guilty con science. If all the senators and representatives are innocent avhy should they object to secret service men? Does the fconest citizen object when he sees a jwliceman on his fctreet? Does the man with a clean back yard set up a Jbowl when he sees a health officer marching about the alleys? If and when congress "slaps" the president" for his utterances about the secret service, there is only one thing the public need care about— That is, that there be an aye and nay roll call. It will be useful to voters at coming elections to know- IWhich of the members of congress object to the policing of |he capitol or any other more or less disorderly house. THE 

TYPEWRITER GIRL HAS A THOUGHT. Editor Press—Much is being said about early Christ mas shopping. I think J speak for the women and girls fwho work when I say that we would be glad to shop early If our employers would let us. Can't you suggest it to Uiemf & T. NOGG, This typewritten note (the signature is a clew) is apparently by a stenographer. Her idea is a g%od one, and the editor is glad to make the suggestion requested. Suppose each employer, not only of women, but of men, should permit his employes to report late to work for a day or two now. Part could take one day and part another, and so the congestion in the in the late afternoon and evenings might be relieved. i One hour in the morning is as potent for shopping as a whole evening. Let the employes take their morning shopping hours In accord with an agreed schedule—a few each day. They Will all work enough harder to prevent any hitch in office, Btore or factory, and it will be a wise investment for the employer to have his workpeople have their Christmas Shopping over with and their minds back on their work. It will be a relief to the salespeople to have their evening rushes lightened, and it will be a benefit to retail merchants to be able to handle their customers in a quiet er and more efficient maimer. "S. T. Nogg's" suggestion is passed on to all em ployers as being a wise economy, to say nothing of being a real manifestation of the holiday spirit of "good will toward men." So let's let all our women employes have a few morn ing hours now in which to do their Christinas shopping, and let's thank our unknown stenographer friend for the Suggestion.

JOHND. INVADES LONDON One of Those Brainstormy Narratives BY FRED SCHAEFER THE RAGGED BOY ON THE SI.EET SWEPT SQUARE Whiplike, the north wind stung the face. Ice fragments, sharp like broken glass, pelted on men's hats or became enmeshed in women's veils. The thermometer at a cor ner drug store contracted Its thread of quicksilver even as one watched it. Like a conqueror forcing a well timed surprise at tack, the blizzard marshaled lis Borean legions and hurled them against the city. On a flagstaff the cold wave flag was snapping fran tically at its halyards as if in panic. Theh weather man issued a hurried forecast _ that there would be a drop of 40 degrees in 12 hours, and he -was right—it was taking place while he was saying It. Men with heavy green overcoats, and other men with overcoats from last year, hunched themselves down into the upturned collars thereof and bucked in a bee line through tbe riot of elements to reach shelter. Fur clad women from the steam heated theaters and shops scurried for the stuffy pro tection offered by straggling street cars. Traffic in the public square thinned out as though it had been swept with a Gatling sun. This was some storm. But the square was not entirely deserted.

DAILY SHORT STORY DRIFTWOOD * "Walker, or Walker ft Crane, kings of acrobatic comedy, took re fuge from the storm in the door way of the dark and deserted hat store. The rain had come up very suddenly and It was cold enough to have the big man shivering and going "B-r-r-r!" for the company of the thing. He had been in the shelter about three minutes when a wrapped up, agile figure slipped across the street from the closed Alcazar and took position at the other side of the door. The sec ond figure was that of a woman, evidently one of the entertainers from the green and gilt theater. Walker's big heart was sore within hi mand he said no word to the shrinking, silent figure Just six feet away. It had been but two months since the king come dian had gone to the little church around the corner with her. And then he had gone with Leath and she had booked for the Empire circuit, to do wonderful little Imi tative stunts from Boston to New Orleans. It was a very hard sepa ration; but they would drift to gether here and there during the season and ther this they must manage to get under the same man agement. But still Bert Walker, acrobatic comedian, nursed the sorest heart. The great, black clouds dropped bigger and bigger globules-and the little figure, ever receding from the encroaching dampness, touched Walker. "Bad storm," he managed. "Last some time, I'm afraid." . The lady turned her head, very quickly, but made no other sign that she had heard. "From the Alcazar?" asked Walker. 1 * "Yes," she replied, In a tinkling voice that reminded the man of some famous actress he had heard but could not place. "I do a turn myself at the Ma jestic," he said. "We were unex pectedly switched in here from Rochester to All a gap. What's your line?" "Monologues—singing—a dance or so. And yourself?" "Rough and tumble acrobat — musical feature," he answered.. There was a silence for a while and both of them gazed moodily into the splashing ratn. The lady broke the silence. "I'm awfully lonesome," she complained. Walker smiled to himself in the darkness. Th.c next thing she would be suggesting lobsters and champaigne—and she would be dis appointed. • "I'm lonely myself," he declared. "Are you really?" she asked so quickly that it amused him. "Yes," he repeated. "I know of a place that I would give the Sa turday pay envelope to see for three hours." She laughed, a clear and silvery laugh, like the famous actress that he could not place. "It is strange that we should both be so lonely. There Is an old proverb or some thing, you know, about 'two being company.' " But that game was not for him now. There was the little church around the corner—and Mazie. Ah, Mazie! The heart of the big man thumped at the thought of her chic, dainty prettiness. He mur mured aloud, without knowing it. "No more eleven-thirty dinners for me. I'm married now." The lady laughed at the mutter ed declination and it seemed to Walker that she was really pleased. But. she came nearsr and talked to him in pleading tones through the darkness. "Oh, a man is not tfecessarily a saint because be happens to be under the matrimonial yoke. Now, if I insisted, you would come and feed me expensive, indigestible things. Wouldn't you, now?" "No!" he thundered. Hang the woman! He was thinking Mazie —Mazie —Mazie very rapidly now. ftOSTAMTHLNG A WORD FROM JOSH WISE. "Even ef a goose were ter cry 'Bravo! ' 'twould sound like a hiss."

"You're pretty smooth, I suppose, and you may laugh, if you wish. I'm satisfied." Then, before he could step from the doorway, she sprang and clutched him about the neck. "Oh, you old, stupid, sanctimonious Bert!" she cried. "I'm just tickled to death!" "Mazie! Mazie!" he exclaimed. "Have you jumped your contract?" "Switched unexpectedly, like yourself," she explained. "Oh, I fooled you with that Lily Langtry imitation, all right. And isn't it grand to be together here!" A great, hulking policeman came along and growled at them. "Here! here! This huggin' on the street don't go. Move on, now." ' But they paid him no heed, and the swirling rain came In and splashed upon their close pressed lips. OPINIONS BY AND ABOUT WOMEN THE QUESTION OF VOTING. By Richard Croker, Ex-Chief of Tammany Hall.

As we get farther away from the primitive conditions of sivilization, man comes to have less and less of a desire for a helpmate, and insists more and more that women shall present herself to him in the light of a luxury. A large proportion of American men really prefer wives who don't know too much. They want an oversexed woman—one who will scream when she sees a mouse, and has to be- helped down from a street car step.
