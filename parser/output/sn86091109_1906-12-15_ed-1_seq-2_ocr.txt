WALTERS JEWELER 418 Main Street New Porter Block Clyde J. Vassar UNDERTAKER. AMBULANCE SERVICE. Telephone 1921—Residence 1923 THE MILWAUKEE LETS CONTRACT Grade and Tunnel Con struction on Road to Begin Soon With the announcement made a few days ago from official sources outlin ing the route to be followed by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul rail road from Evarts to the Pacific coast, contracts for grade and tunnel con tracts for grade and tunnel construc tion are being rapidly let for sections through the states of Washington, Ida ho and Montana. A contract is reported let to Nelson Bennett of Spokane for driving a tun nel 8,750 feet long through the Bitter Root mountains, between Montana and Idaho. In addition to this work Mr. Bennett has contracts for grading in Montana and Idaho, both east and west of the tunnel. There is much heavy work on the grade. It will average 100,000 cubic yards to the mile, nearly all of which is through solid rock. On this stretch of the road there will be several shorter tunnels and some heavy trestle work. Michael Jennings of Spokane has se. cured contracts for building 150 miles of the road from Whitehall, Montana, east to Harlowtown. The base of op erations will be at Jefferson Island. Work will be commenced by all the contractors on the mountain divisions as soon as materials and men can be assembled, and will be pushed through the winter.regardless 0 f weather con ditions. Much of Jennings' work is heavy grading and the boring of sev eral tunnels. His longest tunnel job Is 576 feet, and the shortest Is 160 feet. The contract calls for comple tion of the work within 14 months. " Odds Favor Tacoma. . The official announcement from Chi cago as to roqte of the main line to the Sound* leaves the matter, of Sound terminus with the odds in favor of Ta coma. It is claimed by citizens of that place that Seattle will be on a branch line; that all through trains will'be made 1 up at Tacoma, and all trains westbound will terminate their runs at Tacoma.- and that ships of the Milwaukee's proposed oriental line will sail froip Tacoma. Similar claims were made by that city with regard to the Northern Pacific railroad, which has subsequently ignored all these considerations. The main line of the road will run within nine miles of Seattle, making connection from the Black River Junc tion with Seattle over the tracks of the Columbia & Puget Sound railroad. After leaving Tacoma trains bound east will proceed to Black River Junc tion and then run into Seattle over the Columbia branch and take on baggage and passengers, then come back to the Junction and go east. When the Milwaukee road Is com pleted to the Sound it will have a line 186 miles shorter to Chicago than is the Northern Pacific line. It will also be shorter than the Great Northern road. The new road is securing straightaway runs by the elminatlon of curves and by plowing through rough countries instead of going around. Will Parallel Northern Pacific. For hundreds of miles in the state of Montana the road will parallel the Northern Pacific. But instead of going northwest at St. Regis to reach Spo kane, as the. Northern Pacific does, the Milwaukee continues due west, cross ing the Northern Pacific again at Lind, after traversing Idaho and a portion of eastern Washington. The sweeping curve to the south made by the North ern Pacific between Spokane and the Sound, in which It almost reaches the Oregon line, is entirely obviated by the Milwaukee, which continues straight westwardly from Lind across the bunchp-rass nlalns, striking the North ern Pacific airain at Ellcnsbure. From I that point it parallels the road to the Sound. All told, the Milwaukee crosses the Northern Pacific six times between Tacoma and Butte—at Whitehall. Gar rison, Missoula, Lathrop, St. Regis and Lind. The road to Butte, according to the announcement, will he completed by January 1. 1908. and the line from that place to the Sound by January 1, 1909.

Pictures taken at night at Gomond's WILL WIELD DIG I STICK WITH MR President Has Special Message on Tap for California Chicago, Dec. 15.—A dispatch to the Record-Herald from Washington, says: A special message on the Japanese question and the California school problem supplementary to the discus sion of these same subjects by Presi dent Roosevelt in his regular message, will be sent to congress from the White House next Tuesday. It is stated authoritatively that this special message will be more vigorous in tone than the former communication and will not be calculated to cool the indignation of California previously aroused. The special message, moreover, aside from its local application, will be one of the most sensational co n munlcations in the entire list of those sent to congress by the present ex ecutive. It will bring to a direct issue the centralization scheme of government which is likely to form the climax of endeavor on the part of the Roosevelt administration. Tne administration is about to take advanced ground regarding tne doc trine of federal supremacy over state sovereignty. The Japanese question raised In connection with the public schools of California, has supplie 1 the opportunity to give forcible express ion to the mighty scheme of een - traliaation that is to be perfoi t.i-1, if possible. It is not possible at this writing to forecast, in detail what the president will say in his second messaga on the Japanese question. Accompanying his message, which it is understood will be a full explanation of the ad ministration's project policy as to the supremacy of federal over state power, will be the repoi-t of the spec ial investigation of the San Francisco school, question, made by Secretary of Commercé '.and Labor MWetflf/' I - gardleSs of thé nâture ôf this report, the president will adhere vigorously to the position taken by him in his reg ular -messag- 1 ,' which" was («fcutèp lie fore he left WashingJ^n jo .visit the canal zone, and before he'had any thing at all from Secretary Metcalf. But as to the Metcalf report, it has been learned that its author found much to condemn in the matter of the treatment of Tlapancse outside of ihe school question. H s report, In fact, will furnish a new sensation. .it will show. It is understood, labor un on tyranny over Japanese which affects the rights held to bo theirs by treaty in even more pronounced manner thany anything connected with the school Imbroglio. Matters of this nature embraced in Secretary Metcalf's report will furn sh the key for many arguments to he advanced by the president In his mess age.
