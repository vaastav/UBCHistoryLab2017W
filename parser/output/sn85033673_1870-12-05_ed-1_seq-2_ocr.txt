OIBie: No. 13 Madison Street. MEMI'HIHi Monday Evrninc, . 5, 1870. GOVEBHOE SMITH, OF ALABAMA Governor Smith, tlia defeated candi date for Governor of Aluhania, has takon steps to continue hiiusrilf iu office. He . believe that his right to the oflice of Governor lias not been destroyed or im paired by the late election iu that State, and that Its Hon. R. B. Lindsey baa no yijrht to the office. A bill has been filed in the Chancery Court of Montgomery county by Governor Smith, the object of which is to prevent the Hon. R. B. Lind sey, Governor elect, from taking his seat. Smith charges that the returns of the election to the presiding officer of the Senate, however valid on their face, will he believes, be rendored wholly nnvalid by the evidence of frauds which be has in his possession. This is a common plea put forth by defeated candidates, aud is worthy of little credence, unless the facts are clear in support of the charge. Such evidence is entirely wanting in his case, so far as beard from. None were kept from the polls, either black or white voters, nor were any amount of frauds perpetrated, unless by the Radical party that supported Smith. He beiug Gov ernor of the State at the time bad the entire civil machinery and military power of the State to back him, and was himself responsible for the execution of the law. and if these were not sufficient be had only to call upon the Administra tion for assistance, who has ever shown a willingness to come to the rescue of loyal candidates in the unfortunate Southern States. Not choosing to do this, Governor Smith has obtained the following injunction, restraining Mr. Barr (Radical), presiding officer of the Senate, from counting the vote of Gov ernor and Treasurer: Whereas, William H. Smith has this day filed his bill of complaint against you as defendant, praying, among other things, for an injunction commanding and enjoining you, the said K. IU. linn, from proceeding, as the presiding officer of the General Assembly of Alabama, to the opening and publishing of the re turns of the election for Gover nor, held on the 8th day of November, 1870. in the State of Alabama, and to re frain therefrom until the further order of this Court; and whereas, the said com plainant, upon proper application made to the Hon. B. F. Saflbld, Judge of the Supreme Court of the State, did, on the 20th of November, lt70, obtain an order from the said B. F. Suffold, Judge as aforesaid, commanding the issuing of an injunction in accordauce with the prayer of said bill upon the complainant enU-'ring into bond, etc., and the said complainant having filed his bond, as required by said order, and the same having been approved by me, now these are to command you, the presiding offi cer as aforesaid, the Hon. K. N. Burr, as presiding officer of the Semite and of the General Assembly of the State of Ala bama, to desist and refrain from opening and publishing the returns of the election for Governor held on the nth of Novem ber, 170, in the State of Alabama, until the further order of this court, aud this you shall in so wise omit, and this in junction in no wise disregard, under the penalty of the law. Witness, J. W. IIuohsh, Register. These are novel proceedings and of doubtful validity, but did not act in re nu ainiiig a majority of the joint conven tion of botb Houses from proceeding to count the votes for Governor, as well as other State officers elected. The law re quires the vote to be counted in the presence ol a majority ol ttie Ueneral Assembly, as was done, and not iu the presence of a majority of each House, as the Radical members of that body would have. The remedy for Governor Smith would have been to contest the election after the result had beeu made known by the Speaker of the Seuale, and not to restrain him in the dis charge of a sworn duty under the Constitution. Some of the influential ' Republicans of the Slate do not indorse the course of Gov. Smith, as is evi. denced by the resolution adopted at an indignation meeting lately held at Mont gomery. They see in it nothing more than civil revolution, that must fall with terrible effect upon the Republican party. Radicalism dies hard in the South, and clings to life even after the breath is out of the body of the defunct organization, but it must yield up the ghost if the peo- . pie have the right to govern.. 

FALLING FK0M GRACE. The St. Louis Democrat, a Republi can nutter of acknowledged influence and dignity, was god-father and mother, so to speak, at the birth of the Third Party in Missouri. The Democrat had favored the enfranchisement of the peo ple of Tennessee, and could consistently support the same movement in Missouri by advocating Brown, the liberal, or bolting candidate, for Governor. The only issue of tbe campaign worth men tioning was the enfranchisement of rebels tnd rebel sympathisers. In that State Bore people were disfranchised for their real or supposed sympathies with the South, than were ever in the' Confeder ate service. By supporting Brown the Democrat, for the time, appeared to have cut loose from the policy of such men as Drake and Grant, and united practically with the Democrats and liberal Republi cans. Brown was elected by a majority of 42,000, and the enfranchisement of the excluded classes is now a mere bat ter of time and form. The Democrats had no ticket in the field, hence they supported Brown. The liberal Republi cans with whom they co-operated began to bt called the Third Party. But, like all third parties yet formed, it Bad a short life. The Democrat saw, kfter the elec tion, that then waa no middle ground, and that it must permanently coalesce with tbe Democratic) party, or return to the full fellowship of thr faction .in power. It chose the latter. It virtually admitted that there are only two parties in the State. While enough Republicans were dissatisfied with ihnjr party to make up half the new party, no lemocrats were found dissatisfied with their party. This mournful fact drove the Democrat back to its old party allegiance, with the significant confession that "the present political school of Democracy, 'Copper head ' in all its instincts, ought to lie down and die, tut it woR't; The Dem ocrat revives the qusation of disfratv chisement as an excuse, and claims that it was right at one time; therefore the principle is correct any time. There Is the Doint of divergence. The Democrat thence diverges back into the uncom promising Radical camp. This is too bad, after Buch fair promises; but better to be on either side than between the two. ' Memnhla, From tbo Independent (Miss.) South, Deo. 1.1 This city is connected to us by all the ties which one neighboring community un l attached to another. The short sightedueas of those who inaugurated tbe location of the Memphis and Charles ton railroad aeeming to act for the ad vancement of the great city of Tennes see, stimulated opposition ana anenauHi trade which naturally belonged to Men ?! hia. We are the friends ol .ncmpnisana r nrosDeritv. and we want to see our people and ber people con nected directly by iron ligaments. We waut a railroad from this city to Memphis.and will never feel satisfied until the thing Is accom plished, if we were one of the directors of the . Memphis and Selma road, at its meeting next Thursday at Memphis, W would urge me impunuucc ui oun.Mf the work at once or aa soon as money could be raised so to do. If Memphis and Marshall, Pontotoc, Chickasaw, Monroe and Lownds counties, awake w their interests, the Memphis and Selma road would be built. - No road, except the Little Rock road, would advauce the commercial interest of Memphis as much as the Selma road; when that road is built then we will be in connection with the inexhaustible fields of coal and iron that is to make Alabama and her South ern sisters independent of the North in these great interests. We were at a Democratic Convention in lsis. at Jackson. Mississippi; we bad a good time, all things went well and at the rinse of the convention a resolution was offered to have mine host, General, T. C. McMackin, introduced, lie ap peared and said: " He was a Missis si ppian; he came to her borders naked and she clothed him; hungry aad she fed him; a stranger and she took him in; that he loved her people, was devoted to her interest, and said he was for Missis sippi with or without onions." As he was by Mississippi so are we by Mem phis; we are for ber and her prosperity, with or without "onions." Hence we want this great feeder put in requisition as soon as possible. ,

C8T SPECIAL NOTICES. Habitual Constipation-How to Effect a Cartainand Permanent Cure. Some occu pations of life preiiispoK to Costiveness, esi clally those which allow but little exorcise. Persons who contract this unfortunate habit of body, under such circumstances, migut pouiblv bo relieved by chantrin- their seden tary employments fur others of a more active kind; but this is by no means certain. Habit ual constipation is a very obstinate disorder. All tbe ordinary so-called remedies invariably aggravate it. Nothing can be mora injurious than the continued use of strong aperients, They at Urst irritate, and 6nally almost par alyie the bowels rendering them so torpid that enormous doses or cathartic medicines hare no effect upon them. A mild aperient, combined with a gentle stimulant, is the true remedy; and a combination in the happiest proportion, of these ingredients, is found la Hosteller's Stomach Bitters. This famous Stomachic invigorates tbe whole intestinal canal, while quietly removing from its convo lutions all impedimenta to a froe passage through them. No mere purgative has tnis double operation. No ordinary stimulant effects the desired object. Cases of Constipa tion abandoned as hopeless by distinguished medical men hara been cured In a few weeks by the Bittors. To those who have tried all the medicines of the dispensary in rain, we say try this irresistible stimulant and aierient. There is no sufficient reason why constipation should be the consequence of sedentary habits, llostetter's Bitters, by supplying the vigor which would otherwise be derived from exor cise, will in all eases enable the system to perforin Its excretory funotions regularly anu healthfully. m toi i Avoid fluaeks.
