NASH The Cliiltlred Were Imprisoned, Hall-Starved and Neglected Until They Died, by Their Cruel Father and Step Mother. Baleigh Cor. Charlotte Observer. Raleigh, November 28. Frank Spruill, Esq., Was here to day on his way home from Nash county, where he appeared yesterday as one of the prosecuting attorneys in a case which he says is the most revolting in its heartless cruelty of all of which he has ever had knowledge in North Carolina. George Griffin and wife, white, were tried for causing the death of Griffin's four children by a for mer m rriage. The oldest of the four was barely ten. Griffin and the step-mother put these chil dren in an outhouse, 60 feet from their home, and left them there in one miserable bed, with no atten tion.They fell ill with dropsy,andj in fact were half starved. In June one died. The evidence v as so horrible as to sicken the judge and thejury. lt was in evidence that the inhuman step-mother had said she was "coins to move the mis- erable little dirt-eating devils out into the outhouse ana let tnem die." The grand jury returned a true bill for murder, but it was decided to try for man-slarghter, as it was contended for the de- fence that on account of the grind- ing poverty 01 urimn ana ms wiie the childrtn died as much of dis ease as of nealect, because he could not furnish them medicine. No medicine was given them, no docs rnr saw them. The home of the Griffin's is in the darkest part of Nash countv. The people who lived near clearly did not under stand their duty as neighbors, for they should have taken the chil- dren away by force if necessary, as soon as they discovered their horrible condition. Whenever the neighbors Went to aid the. chiU dren Griffin made threats of vio lence an&'drova tbem away.They tnnk awav the body of the first child who died and buried it. af ter it had remained some time in the bed with the living. At in tervals of about ten days the other children died and the neighbors had to take- away their bodies. It was urged in the attempt to get clemency lor Griffin that he was sick with ty phoid fever part of the time. He was given a 12 years sentence to the penitentiary and his wife 6 years. She got the shorter term because she was no blood rela tion to the children. If ever two people deserved the gallows it was this pair, and it is a wonder they escaped lynching. VERDICT FOR GATTI.S.

Leader of Junta Says His People - Are Willing to Come to an Understanding With United States London, December 1. There is a noticeable incursion of Fili pinos into London and Paris. The report subsequently denied that Agoncillo, Aguinaldo's agent in Europe, was contem plating going to Hong Kong to reorganize there the Filipino transport an 3 re-supply the Fili pinos with munitions of war has given rise to the belief that the Filipinos in Europe are contem plating a new campaign. A rep resentative of the Associated Press has interviewed one of the most prominent members of the European Junta, who has just returned from Paris and Madrid he said: "We are planning no new cam paign. There is no reason wny Agoncillo should go to Hong Kong to give the Filipinos a fur- ther supply of munitions of war. The fact that Agoncillo has just leased a home in Paris shows that he intends to remain there and watch events. The reports from our committees at Kobe, Yokohama, Macoa,Batavia,Hong ftnd Bangkok show they are all workmg weu. This is also evi- denced by the fact that 10,000 rifles were smuggled into Manila last month, "The war is no nearer an end tban ever. The Filipino resource j-s uy icu iacs mat Aguinaiao is con tinuing to keep and feed 3,000 Spanish prisoners. We are deep ly disappointed at the re-election ot Mr. McKinley. Although our agents in the United States never led us to believe Mr. Bryan wouldactively help us, yet we relied on tne strength of the an ti-imperialists in the United States. "We are still anxious to come to an understanding, and there are indications that Mr. McKin- lev iavors a compromise, it is clsar tb at Judge Taft goes be yond his instructions and that Mr. McKinley is prepared to give greater concessions than Judge Taf t. It is true that a large numbar of Filipinos are flocking to European countries. At least sixty are now in London, but not with the idea of renewed pro- pagahda. The Junta is content to wait until tne Americans are tired of losing officers and men by deaths from sickness. We hope and believe better times are in store." Astounding Discovery. From Coopersvi!le,Mich., comes word of a wonderfol discovery of a pleasant tasting liquid that when used before retiring by any one troubled with a bad cough always ensures a good night s rest. "It will soon cure the cough, too," writes Mrs. S. Himelburger, "for three generations of our family have used Dr. King's New Dis covery for Consumption and never found its equal for Coughs and Colds."

War Tax Should he Reduced $30 000,000 Recommends a Army of 100,000 and Stronger Navy. Washington, Dec. 3. The President's message was sent to Congress and read before both houses today. The President begins his mes sage by describing the present prosperity of the country, and contrasting its importance and size with .what it was at the time of taking the first census in 1800. It then numbered but five million people, and was composed of but 900 square miles. He devotes considerable space to the history of the Chinese trouble, and pays a splendid tri bute to the heroism of thef Amer- ican soldiers, sailors and ma rines, who rescued the band in the legations. "In all the stirring chapter," he says, which re cords the heroism of the devoted band, clinging to hope in the face of despair, and the undaunt ed spirit that led their relievers through battle and suffering to the goal, it is a memory of which my countrymen may be justly proud that the honor of our flag was maintained alike in the seige and the rescue, and that stout American hearts have again set high in fervent emulation with true men of other races and lan- onaoroc t.Vio inrlnmitahl ft . p.nn rasrfi that eyer strives jor the cause of right and justice." The President looks upon mat ters of indemdity for our citizens who have suffered by the Boxer outrages, as a matter of grave concern. The compensation, in part, wil, come, he thinks, in benefits derived from the open ing of China to the equal . com merces of the world. He express es the hope that the powers will not attempt to force demands from China that the Imperial government will be unable to meet. Our success at the Paris Ex position is a matter of gratifica tion, says the President. We cap tured more pr;z3s there than any other competing nation. He believes that the new im perial meat inspection law in Germany will be enforced; with out the features of discrimina tion that prevailed under the old law. He congratulates the ceun try on the good will prevailing between our government and all the powers. The President hopes that the Alaskan boundary dispute willl be soon settled by definitely de- terming the 141st Meridan by means of telegraphic observa tion. ' Lynching he denounces in strong terms, repealing his for mer declaration that it is a re proach to our civilization. Regarding the Nicaragua canal he commends the "early atten tion of the Senate to the conven tion with Great Britian to facili ate the construction of such a canal, and to remove any objec tion which might arise out of the convention commonly called the Clay ton-Bulwer reaty." He believes the Sultan of Tur kev will Py the money he owes us. "His Majesty's good disposi tion toward us in this regard," says the President, ''has been evinced by the issuance of an irade for rebuilding the American college at Harpool. He scores the Senate rather se verely for failure to act upon the the commercial convention sub mitted to that body last session, and says that much disappoint ment among the interests aflected has been caused thereby. The surplus revenues for the last fiscal year were $79,527, 060. 18, he says. The six preceding years showed only deficits, the aggregate of which amounted to more than a hundred million dol lars. Our foreign trade shows a reo markable record of industrial aod commercial progress, he says, and on account of this wonderful pros perity he advocates cutting down the war revenue taxes to the amount of thirty millions annual ly. "Those taxes which are most burdensome to the people should be lopped off. He reiterates his former de termination to "uphold the sove reignty of the United States in the Philippines, as in all other places where our flag rightfully floats." Speaking of the Filipinos whom he calls the "wards of the nation," he says, "our obligation a guardian was not lightly as sumed, and must be honestly ful filled," and predicts prosperity for our island possessions. The President declares for a Pacific cable, for anti-trust laws that will suppress those combina tions that are hurtful to trade, asks for an army of 100,000 men and advocates Secretary Long's recommendations regarding the navy. He pays a high compliment to the efficiency of both the land and sea service, and praises the administration in Porto Rico. He sas tbe new census bureau has accomplished gratifying re, suits, and continues his message by urging Congress to practice economy and net allow the won derful general prosperity to lead its members iato ex'rayagance. Men can be curedprivately and pos- tlvely at home of all weakness and disease. VV rite for new free book, Dr J. N. Hath way, 22 D South Broad Street, Atlanta, Ga. 

KFDUCED TO FIVE. Crumpacker's Bill; Takes Away Four Jf.C.Congressmen Washington, D. C , Dec. 3, The first bills introduced in ithe House today were the army re organization bill and the Con gressional apportionment bill. The latter is by Crumpacker, of Indiana. It provides for "a re apportionment of Congressiona representation of Louisiana,Mis- sissippi, North and. South Caro lina bv 13 votes. According to Crumpacker's bill the House wil have 3bo members, tne appor tionment being on a basis ; of 198,000 population. The army bill is the work of the Military Affairs Committee, and is father ed by Chairman Hull, of Iowa. Great Luck of An Editor. r "For two years all efforts to cure Eczema in the palms of my hands failed," writes editor H. N.

Notwithstanding President Mc Kinley's assurance that there is not going to be any Empire, Mr. Ed ward Atkinson's pulse is still above normal. It is mildly suggested that the missionaries who are rushing back to China might begin work on the soldiers of the allies just to jret their hand in. Ex-Governor Hogg says the re sult of the last election caused him to lose confidence in the country. That's nothing: think of losing a week's salary. As the desire to annex Cuba grows stronger in this country the more do our people convince themselves that the Cubans are incapable of self-government. As showing the strong influences of heredity it may be noted that the son of a Philadelphia policeman has been in a deep sleep for two weeks and cannot be awakened. Tbe indications are that a river and harbor bill of immense propor tions is to be pressed this winter. Well, this is better than giving a subsidy to ships that sail in ballast. Chairman Parker, of the middle- of-the-roadsters, is still of the opin ion that "the Populist party holds he key to the political situation." But the Republican party holds the situation, which is better still. Over 50,000,000 people attended the Paris exposition, and yet it was a financial failure. A little game of reeze-out ought to be arranged be ween the management and the Chi cago board of aldermen to settle the international championship. "During the Chinese campaign," t i J says an .Eingiisn correspondent, "General Chaffee always rode where the Chinese were most likely to see and shoot at him," says an exchange. Well, what of it; isn't it customary for the commanding general to seek a place of safety during a battle? Governor Roosevelt is now receiv ing several hundred letters daily and has had to employ two extra stenog raphers to keep up with his corres pondence. This indicates that the popular idea is that the Rough Rider" is going to be an important part of the next administration. Governor Lind. of Minnesota, will appoint an ad interim Senator to fill the seat of the late Senator Da vis until the meeting of the .Legisla ture oh January 8 next. Liind is a f usionist, and it is said that he will probably appoint Charles a Towne, who is of the same political stripe. Towne would have but a short time to serve, as the Legislature is Re publican. Canadian clamor for a mint in which to coin the Yukon gold, which now finds its way to - the United States for mintage, is perfectly nat ural and as clearly misdirected. Gold, like other things, goes where the most of it, is wanted. If every ounce of geld mined in the Yukon were coined in Canada the bulk of it would come to the United States to be recoined, because trade condi tions demand its nse here and in transit to other gold-using countries. The National Afro-American Coun cil has appointed a committee to see that the validity of the Louisiana suffrage act of 1898 is tested by the Federal Uourt, The opinion 01 a number of leading la wyery, North and South, has been obtained re- i specting the Louisiana and North J Carolina laws restricting suffrage and the Supreme Court will have be fore it shortly cases that it is be lieved will secure an expression of its opinion respecting" these' suffrage laws. The bill submitted by the admin istration providing for the reorgan ization of the army is a very remark able bill. All the charges as to a great standing army are fulfilled in it. and the President is besides made a judge of its Bize. The Presi dent is given more power under this bill than the Emperor of Germany possesses or any other constitutional sovereign. The Czar will, if this bill become law, be the only ruler who will have more power than President McKinley. The government of Honduras has finally paid the indemnity demanded) ot it by the United States for the murder of Frank Pears. This con clusion is gratifying, because for a long time Honduras persisted in re fusing to acknowledge its liability. The recognition of the fact of its li ability came rather suddenly about a month ago, and the draft of the money soon followed. The paymenty it is hoped, will impress other na tions with the conviction that the United States is prepared to protect its citizens abroad; and if necessary to exact punishment for their ill treatment. Lord Kitchener has now taken up Lord Roberts'task of reporting the battles with the Boers. It is expect ed in England that Kitchener will prosecute the war more relentlessly than Roberts has done and will al low no sentimental or other consid erations to interfere with an effect ive "pacification" of South Africa. It is recalled how he pacified the Soudan by wiping out the Mahdi's followers, and he appears to have started out a similar, plan in the Transvaal, the plan which the ear lier Britons objected to in their in vaders: "To carry away, to sieze, to slaughter is their government, and where they make a solitude, they call it peace." And Englishmen pro fess surprise that the sympathy of the world has turned so generously to the Boers. The most beautiful girl in the world is dead. She was but sixteen years old, and killed herself last Sunday in New York. She was a model, the delight of the sculptors, the sorrow of her husband. For she had run away and married a boy but two years older than herself. He could not support her as her father had, so she became a model. The artists raved over her, and she be came so famous tha t she soon was earning more money than her hus band. They had a quarrel and ehe killed herself. Dressed in her new est gown, with her hair beautifully arranged, she lay on her bed and swallowed morphine. Not even in death could she bear the thought of not being beautiful. But in her death there is the birth of a new Venus. The model of her figure will stand in bronze, eight feet high, on the top of the new municipal build ing in St, Paul, the wonder and the admiration of the generations to come, but the body of the poor girl rests in a suicide's grave. As the mosquito has no greater enemy than the fair sex,the fact that the women of certain towns are forming clubs to fight it is news of direful import for anopheles quad rimaculatus. At Richmond Hill, a suburban town near New York, in Long Island, ihey got a scientist to explain the value of crude petroleum, or kerosene oil, as an exterminator of the young of the mosquitoes. They explored the country around their town with boys provided with oil cans, and wherever there was a puddle, or ditch,or pond, or marsh any standing water there they poured oil generously on the sur face. A committee of the mosquito club took the job in hand and saw it well done. The result has been, we are told, that the residents of Richmond Hill enjoyed sitting out on their porches last summer,having almost complete immunity from mosquitoes. Ihe oil gets into the breathing apparatus of the mosquito larvee and kills them. 4 :1 sr 4 y k ft ; fl & i it C f 1 I E. I II Hi iff " lit ! Ii l , - Si a! iso cure, no pay.
