Such are in great part the obsta cles to a fair participation of the United States in the markets of South America. It is, however, in the want of facilities of com mercial intercourse and correspondence with foreign countries on this continent that we find the chief obstacle to the great object stated. It is only while we compare the facilli ties for this purpose furnished by other na tionswith the almosteptire absence of similar accommodations on the part of our own gov ernment that we realise the true cause of this restricted intercourse. On turning to authentic sources we find the amounts ap plied by those nations, who enjoy the greatest part of the tropical trade, to stand in com parison with our own somewhat as follows: The English subsidy for Ceptral, South American and West India Royal Mall Steamship Company, and Pacific Steamship Company $930,000 The French subsidy for the Com pagnie Menageries Maritimes, et Compagnie Urande Trans-At lantique ......... ............ 1,449,451 $2,379,451 There are, besides, many lines of German steamers running to the same ports with those of France and England. The sole ap propriation made by the government of the United States at present to the same service consists in an assignment to ocean steamers of a part of the sea postage, which they carry themselves. The postal receipts last year from the lines trading to South America, Australia, Japan and China was $107,368 55. "The cost of sea conveyances," or subven tion, was $47,840 49. The South American service was last year kept separate from that of Australia and China. It produced to this government $9 ,971, of which this government returned to the car riers $52,101, leaving to the Postoflice Depart ment a not profit of $44,870 42. It certainly evinces admirable enterprise on the part of those American steamers to meet the compe tition of a subsidized foreign service and to pay their own government a profit upon a service which cost the government nothing and for the performance of which it would have otherwise been compelled to pay foreign veessels. T"he late President of the United States took a more liberal and sagacious view of the public duty. In his annual message of 1875 he said: "The United States are now paying over $100,000,000 per annum for freights and pas sengers on foreign ships. * * * It is to be regretted that this disparity in the carrying trade exists, and to correct it I would be will ing to see a great departure from the usual course of government in supporting what may be usually termed private enterprise. 1 would not suggest as a remedy direct subsidy to American steam shipping, but I would suggest the direct offer of compensation for carrying the mail between Atlantic seaboard cities and the continent in American owned and American built steamers, and would ex tend this liberality to vessels carrying the malls to South American States and to Cen tral America and Mexico, and would pursue the same policy from our Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on the Pacific." The President also esaid in another message of 1875: "Thn anhadIlv f alfno0n nrM. annmm fnr carrying the mails Tetween New York and Rio de Janeiro having ceased on the 80th of September last, we are without direct mail facilities with the South American States. This is greatly to be regretted, and I do not hesitate to recommend the authorization of a renewal of that contract, and also that the service may be increased from monthly to semi-monthly. The commercial advantages to be gained by a direct line of American steamers to the South American States will be far beyond the expense of the same." In like manner the Chamber of Commerce of New York, in a spirit of enlarged and im partial wisdom, has said: "In our last report we invited attention to the importance of developing our trade with our natural neighbors and allies, the South Ameri can States. The Chamber has even favored re strictions in trade. It would not now sup port a subsidy to any steam line to Europe. It is not necessary. But it has repeatedly expressed its belief that only by government aid in the beginning can such communica tions with the Southern Continent be estab lished as will ensure the opening of their markets to American produce, in which the West as producers, and the North and South as carriers and consumers, are alike interest ed. In this commerce is the future hope of New York." It is thus made obvious that with a more moderate rate of reciprocal duties between the European nations and the Southern American States, and with the peculiar if not exclusive facilities of intercourse with those States and Colonies enjoyed by European nations, they must continue to command the great proportion of the trade already stated. In this fact we find an explanation of the in significant trade enjoyed by the United States with the Empire of Brazil. Our minister to that country reports twenty lines of European steamers in its ports without one from the United States, and says that much of the freights, passengers and correspondence be tween the United States and Brazil has to pass through a British port in its transit. Much opposition has been recently made against giving national aid to foreign postal service. Statesmen who have sub mitted without remonstrance to gifts of pub lie lands and to loans of public money, to be employed in railroad construction and re imbursed by military and postal services to the government, seem embarrassed by the proposal to consummate the postal service by extending the transportation of the mail upon the sea. It may possibly puzzle such casuiste to explain how, under a simple power to "establish postoffices and posts routes," Congress has acquired any right to pay for carrying the mails at all. We may assume that a postal service was so indispensable to the commercial and social Intercourse of the people that the service was "necessary and proper" to exercise this granted power. Upon this reasoning the au thority and the obligation is not limited to the internal intercourse of the country, but may be extended wherever that intercourse may require. The deck of an American vessel is the territory of the nation, and the national lurisdiction is as clear over any contract of service on the deck of that vessel, as on the back of any mule bestrode by any mail rider on the staked plain of Texas. The obligation of Congress is not restricted to land routes, nor does it cease at the sea coast. This obligation to carry the mail on the land cost the American people last year $33,263,459. This was nearly five millions more than the government derived from the poetages. With what justice can the govern ment expend so large a sum in the imperfect performance of this obligation, by failing to deliver those missives at their ultimate des tination ? There is a great international postal union to which almost all civilized na ilons are parties. How humiliating for the United States to declare that it would deliver 0o mail that does not bear its own expenses ! .o better example can be given of the false ,oonomy of such doctrines than that the gov )rnment, with a laudable liberality, now fur ilshes a double daily mail between all the treat cities of the East and West to New )rleans, on a time, varying with the respec ive localities, of from 32 to 62 hours. Our Minister to Venezuela mentions the act that American flour is carried to England n be baked, and is then brought back to this montinent to the consumer. An American aptain, trading for years on the Amazon pier, constantly transported American flour rought over from England. The city of New )rleans in 1876 received nearly five millions i dollars In coffee from Brail, without hav ag in the same time cleared a single vessel or the port of Rio de Janeiro. 3uch of this mall matter as be destned or South a nstead of zbaeE Pfb L~rwi an wu Ntld a ng of about 400 mimi, y l and steamer ith a run lngtime ofbolt s and a hal days; from Chlcgroto Aspinwall, via New Yorlk would be about 38600 miles by rail and steamer, with a running time of eight and a half days. Indeed, the adoption of a steam postal ser vice from New Orlans to Aspinwall would not only effect a great saving of cost to the government, but would save a day and a half mail time between Aspinwall and New York over the present connection between those two points. It has by no means escaped the observation of the Western and Southwestern people, that by denying them this connection, and forcing them to make this detour, their trade and correspondence with South America is sub jected to a virtual supervision by the Eastern Atlantic dies, and they are thus compelled to pay Eastern Atlantico railroads, canals, fac tors insurance and shipping a tribute equal to the difference In the actual cost of travel and transportation via New York and New Orleans respectively. These Western people are indebted to Eastern . capitalists for rail roads and for much of their river shipping, and these vehicles of transportation are thus compelled to contribute of their legitimate business to the support of a rival system of transportation. The government has, by lib eral appropriations, fostered the maritime in terests of the Eastern ports. An impartial re gard for the great interior interests would emancipate at least their continental com merce from the thraldom under which it now suffers. Some idea of our utterdisregard of the vast future possibilities of trade in ourown hemis phere is indicated in the report of the Post master General, who, in referring to the ne cessity of improved postal facilities with South America, uses the following language: "There is no portion of the world with which the United States has as unsatisfactory mail arrangements as with South America. The correspondence for Brazil and other countries on the east coast, in the absence of amny regular, direct mail uteamship cmmmiunica fion, is forwarded via England; and the cor respondence for countries on the west coast, sent via Panama, can only be prepaid to the ports of debarkation on that coast, with no a-surance of its being forwarded to interior destinations, and always leaving a local postal charge, excessive in amount, to be col lected from theaddreseseon its delivery." As your memorlalists have thus protested against this monopoly, it would by no means become them to claim the natural occupancy of any commercial territory not legitimately their own. It would be proper to divide this continental commerce and postal service among these great logitudrlial districts: 1. The Eastern Atlantic States and seaports. 2. The Pacific States and seaports. 8. TheStates lying between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains. Each of these great commercial districts should be provlded- with equal and adequate facilities for postal communication with its peculiar and appropriate continental ter ritory. Your memorialists, however, confine themselves to asking at your hands the postal service, to which they consider this great commercial district represented by them entitled. They respectfully but earnestly request that the Senate and House of Representatives will In quhi e into the expediency of 1. Granting an appropriation from the national treasury adequate to the support of two lines of postal steamers, American built and American owned. One to run semi monthly between the ports of New Orleans and Rio Janeiro, in the Empire of Brazil. The other to run semi-monthly between the ports of New Orleans and Aspinwall, in the State of Panama, and United States of Co lombia, according to such schedules of time and stations as Congress may in its wisdom prescribe. 2. That the President is resanotfully re r pretscrie. 2. That the President is respectfully re quested to take into consideration the expe t diency of directing a review of all commer Scial treaties and conventions between the e United States and other powers having dominion upon this continent, with a view B to establish such a parity of revenue duties upon commodities, the growth and product of a the said contracting powers, respectively, and to secure such modification of port and a other commercial charges in all cases as will - promote the reciprocal, business and political fraternity of such contracting powers, and B especially to secure the adhesion of all such r powers to the international postal union. 3. That the Senators and Representatives In Congress representing the interests pro sented by this memorial, may extend such legislative aid as may be necessary to give effect to the International steam postal service herein asked for, as well as to favor the principles of commercial reciprocity and friendly intercourse with our neighbors and allies of this continent, by such modification of our revenue duties as may be necessary to give effect to any treaties or convention of reciprocity, which may be negotiated by the proper department of the government.
