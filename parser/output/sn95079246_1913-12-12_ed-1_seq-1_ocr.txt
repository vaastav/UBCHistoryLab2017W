In an interesting letter from this place, Mrs. Bettie Bullock writes as follows : "I suffered for four years, with v/omanly troubles, and during this time, I could only sit up for a little while, and could not walk anywhere at all. At times, I would have severe pains in my left side. The doctor was called in, and his treat ment relieved me for a while, but I was soon confined to my bed again. After that, nothing seemed to do me any good. I tad gotten so weak I could not stand, and I gave tip in despair. - At last, my husband get me a botlle o f Cardui, the woman's tonic, and 1 com menced taking it. From the very first dose, I could tell it was helping me. I can now walk two miles without its tiring me, and am doing all my work."

J-62 PREDICTS WAR Confess Man.i B3 iavas It is l.uvila&ii prepar!::g fcb trouble House Passes Bill Authorizing Presi dent to Raise Volunteers In "Time of Actual or Threatened War." James 11. Mann, the Ee;*blican lead er ol" the house, declared in the course of debate that war belween the United Stales and Mexico is inevitable and that the president is making arrange ment accordingly. The fact that the Democra's allowed this statement to go unchallenged has added to its significance. Mr. Mann's prophecy of war with Mexico came a-i a surpr.se and created a deep impres sion in the house. It added to the im portance of a bill called up by Rep.e sen.ative Hay, of Viignia, and later passed, authorizing the president to ra:se volun.ejr forces "in time of act ual or threatened war." Mr. Mann s^.id solemnly that the Hay bill was part of the plan of the gov ernment to get itself in readiness .or war with Mexico. From the moment that Mr. Mann took part in the debate interest in the proceedings were enliv ened and the "voluntary army" bili was passed by a unanimous vote. Predicting war with Mexico, Mr. Mann said: "I should grearly regret such a war. I do not see any escape from chaos and anarchy in Mexico un der the plnn which we are now pursu ing. Of course, if that runs very long it means war." Mr. Mann told of the situation that obtained in congress just before the war with Spain and suggested that the appearance of the Hay bill on tho day following President Wilson's pub lic discussion of the Mexican situa tion in his message was significant. The flay bill, which provides for a voluntary army to be raised in tha discretion of the president, now g. ei to the senate. It was said that body will take immediate action upon the measure. Color is given to the statement of Mr. Mann that the administration is preparing for trouble by the haste that marked the passage of the Hay bill. The measure was ordered reported at a special meeting of the military af fairs committee on Tuesday and given the right of way in the house imme diately after the transaction of some routine business. Further evidence in support of Mr. Mann's belief that the administration, is preparing for trouble was found in an announcement made by Democratic leaders that early next week the Louse will pass the naval military bill. This bill proposes to enlarge and gender the naval militia more efficient, plac ing it on a foundation somewhat simi lar to that upon the land miliiia rests. That is, the naval rnili ary will be pro vided with more me nand more ade quate equipment. MBS,

A common darning naedle found in the thea.cr box in Newark, N. J., oc cupied by Mrs. Ma jo- is H. Graff, a bride of a week, is believed to be tho instrument by means of which Mr3. Graff was inoculated with a subtle poison which caused her to fall insen sible within a few minutes. This developed with the arraign ment of Arman.l Mogaro, a Cuban stu dent pharmacist, the other occupant of the box, on s charge of assault. The nee.lle was submitted to a chemist. It was found near the spot where Mrs. Graff s^t. Mcgnro stoutly asserted his innocence when confronted by Mrs. Graff on the witness stand. She said she haJ fe:t a sting on her hand, as if she had been pricked by a pin or a needle, that her band had quickly become numb and that tho feeling spread to her arm. She left tho box and went to the women's waiting room, where she fell unconscious, but was soon revived. Megaro, who sat be hind her, was arrested before leaving the theater. He was held in $20,000 bail. Mr. and Mrs. William Graff were married Iwo weeks ago. They went to stop with friend 3 in Newark. While taking a walk Mrs. Graff entered a vaudeville and moving picture theater for an hour's entertainment. A few minutes later a man entered the b x.

With on effort she left the box and one of the women ushers assisted her to the retiring room. After she recov ered she told Police Liuetenant Farrell of the pain in her hand, which was now badly in?.amed and swollen. Dr. J.

Advices received in Washington in- ' dieale thai ceitain fo.eLn gcvern ments have recently reached the con- ; elusion that the United States is again ton.empIaUng recogni i~n oi the Con stitutional's as a ttcp tow id a so lution of the Mexican problem and eliminating Huerta. There is some reason to believe, however, that this idea of other inter ested gcvernmen s is In part due to their intense desire that the United States do something to bring relief to the situation. Their impatience at the "watch and wait" policy is well known and it is understood that there has been no hesitation on their part in making this feeling known to the Unit ed States. The result has been a sort of indi rect pressure on the administration to do something to hasten indirectly at least to solve the difficulty in Mexico. Recognition of the Constitutionalists I has appeared to some European diplo matists as the next likely move of President Wilson as long as this gov ernment adheres to its policy of acting only indirectly upon Huerta. No confirmation of the reported in tention to recognize the Constitution alists could be obtained. It is regard ed as likely, however, that some step will be taken to assist the revolution ists, short of actual recognition. Advices to the state department re ported that the situation in the Aca pulco district is growing worse. This has been a center of anti-American ism. Merchants from outlying districts are removing to the city of Acapuleo. From Ladero it is reported that the exodus of refugees from Monterey and vicinity continues.

This was the third time the presi dent had personally addressed con gress, the two previous occasions be ing the expression of his views on the tariff and the Mexican situation.
