Xew MexicoLand Claim Rejected. Tho Galveston News Bays that tho expectation that Surveyor-General Goo. W. Julian, of New Mexico, would make his mark there is being realizod. It rofors to tho following telegrams Washington, December 3. Land Cnminissioner Snnrks has reforod to the Secretary of tho Interior for transmittal to Congress tuo report ot Surveyor General Julian, of New Mexico, of his investigation of tho private land claim known as Ojo del Anil, involving somo 70,000 acres. Tho commissioner concurs with the surveyor-general in recommending tho rejection by Congress of this claim, as unfounded and unmeritori ous. Tom Varnoll, tho rapist and mur derer, of whoso unmitigated crimes everyone has heard, has contrived to bo admittod to bail and is now at largo in Waco. It is said ho will ap ply for a change of venue, and it is nrodictod he will bo acquitted, os several years havo elapsed and the witnesses nro scattered. If so, it will be a most damning stigma on the administration of justice. Wo are iu receipt of a copy of the minutes of tho hist meeting of tho Toxas Pross Association. They are of unusual interest, because of the inseitiou of Judge Norton's full his tory of tho nowspapers of tho State from tho earliest times to the prosont. This fact wo should think would moko an extra demand for tho min utes. The original letter writton by Ben edict Arnold to the American people in vindication of his character after tho attempted betrayal of his coun try into tho hands of tbo British, is now in the possession of tho Kings ton Freeman. It was found in an old loft in Kingston. Ex-Governor John S. Phelps, of Missouri, is dead. Tho ex governor though an original democrat, was a staunch Union man; and though his property near Springfield was des troyed by guerillas, ho remained after tho war steadfast to his early politi cal training, and died a domocrat. nonrv Goorgo declares himsolf a freo trader of tho most pronounced type. Upon this point, at least, ho is entitled to tho support of every man who works for his living, nino tenths of whom aro opposed to tho existing system of protecting a few factory barons at tho expense of consumers. And now it is charged that Mr. Manning, tho now Minister to Mex ico, has met a similar fate to that al leged of Sedgwick. All of which goes to show tho importanco of im parting temperanco principles and practice in high as well as low places. Mr. Cranfill, of tho Gatesvillc Ad vance, aunouuecs that he will re movo his paper to Waco tho begin ning of next year, as affording a wider and moro commanding field for his work as a prohibition editor. We wish liiiu continued success. Congress tret on Monday.

WAKIIISUT0.X LETTER. (From Our Ili'gulur Correpoudcnt.) Wasiiinoto.n, D. C Nov. 20, '8. The streets "f tho city arc again alivo with a busy, bustling throng, and up at tho long deserted Capitol, Chairman Randall, with a quorum of his committee, has for a week been pressing work on Appropriation bills. Ho reports flno progress, and Buys Congress will not havo to wait long on him for money bills. During tue wcok ho has had in consultation the heads of different bureaus and gov ernment establishments, with regard to the needs of their respective de partments for the next year. Among these were Prof. Baird, of tho Na tional Museum, Smithsonian and Fish Commission; Superintendent Thome, of tho Coast Survey; Dr. Godding, of tho Government Insane Asylum; Col. Wilson, of public build ings and grounds, and othors. Tim imnrovod condition of tho government servico under democratic administration has been mentioned repeatedly, but new instances of re form aro contiuuuiiy mauing wem selvcs felt, which deserve especial notice. Tho President probably nnvor niado a happier stroke of public policy than whon he called Mr. Bene dict here to bo I'uulic rrinter. xn the period of three months Umj noto riously demoralized Government Printing OlUco has boon piu in sucn order that about one-third more work is now being dono with the samo amount of money, and tuo press room which three months ago had 400 forms waiting for tho press is now clear, having "c iugnt up. It is too bad tho president cannot bo left in poaco and quiet with his mndnHr. Utile country home. As soon ns tho real estate dealers of Washing ton knew of his intention to buy tins nlnr Mipv Rnnnred ns much trround in the vicinity as possible and ever since they have been using tno res ident's name in tho most liberal man ner in connection with all sorts of schemes they have organized for im provements at public expense. Of course, the president has been in no way concerned in these mnnceuvcrs, but rumors to that effect cannot but be annoying to him. In tho late elections the Prohibi tionists claim to have cast about 325, 000 votes, bnt that is no fair test of tlm Prohibition feelinc in the coun try. In that election votes were cast for pcrnons to till tho political omces, on,i in rf rlians thousands of cases, voters favoring Prohibition saw no earthly chance for electing their cuu ,i;.l.irn nnd dosirin? to be well repre sented, cast their votes for men of other parties. Iu other casep, there wcro no Prohibition cuuoiuaies, ana in still others tho candidates put forth were utterly untittou lor uie .Mnixa Bfiiirrht,. nnd candid, consistent men would not voto for them on that round. TV tnRf.thn rmoation fullv nnd fair ly get it before the people at a general election nnd lot the tickets e printed. For Prohibition les, or No. Uvl this matter before tho whole people, nnl nn its own merits, and let them say what shall be dono. St. Louis Christina Advocate. Goldsmith, when ho wrote the lines. "Ill fares llio land to hastening ills a prey. Where wealth accumulates aud men decay," summed up the whole labor question. Tho vast accumulation c; wealth and subjugation of tho mrsses to the will and power of those who possess it, is tho certain prelude to the down fall of tho nation. History records the fact, and it caunot be questioned.
