This is an important -matter to the people of Western Kansas and Colorado. It will also benefit the wbole country. A comprehensive synop sis of the message appears on the Inside pages. Western members of Congress inter ested in irrigation have bold a caucus, and a definite plau of action was mapped out with a view of St curing legislation in "conformity to the views expressed by the President in regard to irrigation. What is known as the Xenlaods bill was made the bat-is of the proposition. It provides for the construction of leservoiis and canals from money received by the government in the sale of ptiblic lands. These sales amount to $1,250,000 annually. Tt is supposed that $500,000,000 will be needed to construct the irrigation system. Senator Burton, of Kansas, said be considered President Roosevelt's message to congress one of the ablest state papers ever presented to that body. "Mr. Roosevelt has lived on the plains, bunted in the mountains, been on the sea, served ' in mioor political positions, been a man of business affairs and a soldier, and p bows in bis message that be bas thor oughly investigated and comprehended nearly every detail of the subjects with which he deals," said the senator. ""That part of the message dealing with the subject of irrigation is witbc ut doubt the clearest and most cf-nvii.cing argument on the subject ever reduced to wiiting." 

MAIN POINTS IN PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. " , The federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the president. Anarchy should be made an offense against the laws of nations, Prosperity can never be created by law alone, although it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. Publicity is the only sure remedy that can now be evoked against trusts and the nation should also assume power of supervision over all corpor ations doing an interstate business. Advocates the creation of a cabinet officer to be known as the secretary of commerce and industry. Favors the enforcement of the eight-hour law. Immigration law should be amend ed so as to protect and elevate the general body, politic and social. "While favoring the principal of reciprocity nothing . could be more unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time. It is unwise for the United States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the distribu tion of our goods and favors a ship subsidy bill. Calls especial attention of Congress to the need of strict economy in ex . penditures. Railroad rates should be open and just to all shippers.

The New iork Herald of May Sth says : "It's strange what strides the stage bas made in the past five years, not to speak of a century. Business men have taken a band in the pie, and find it a very profitable investment. Lawrence Bar rett, during his grand struggle through numberless difficulties, was backed by some of the solid business men of Boston.

TEACHERS ASSOCIATION- The annual meeting of the Southwest Kansas 'Teachers' Association was held Thursday evening and Friday and Friday evening, in the Christian church. The attendance was larger than last year, tbe enrollment reaching about 125. The address of welcome was made by Hon. T. A. Scates of this city. Mr. Scates made a talk Jn a happy vein in his usual felicitous manner. The visitors felt that all the doors of hospitality were opened to them. The response was made in as cordial a manner by Miss Kettie M. Lawrence. In tbe prize contest in declamation the honors were won by Miss Whitney, of Larned, who gained the first prize, Miss Crawford, of Garden City, second honors, and Miss Viola Kampf, of Dodge City carried off third prize. As usual in all such cases, had the audience been the judges, the awards wonld have been re versed. Friday was taken up whollyln the dis cussion of practical topics in school ed ucation. ,The paper on '-What is Educa tion of Most Worth," read by Principal D. A. Baugher, of Kinsley, out-weighed, in our estimation all other subjects, be cause it dealt with those questions which establish tbe character of the pupil or scholar. He spoke on the lines of phys ical, intellectual, moral and spiritual training or education. The best type of manhood comes from the moral and physical traiuing. To neglect these and make the intellectual part tbe sole aitn is to dwarf the better elements of character. We must teach physical character build ing, with moral and intellectual training. But we must not lose sight of -the most important element in human character, that of the cultivation of tbe human soul. The spiritual thought ought to be devel oped in the young people. Physical and intellectual culture are sadly deficient without the reverence of God. The mor al and Christian principle must be estab lished so that tbe student has the best means on which to conduct his life. The young person who is not equipped with the moral and spiritual graces has the roughest road to travel. Our education should mean the teaching of Christian principles as well as the rudiments of a common education. The Bible ought to be read in tbe public scbools and tbe schools opened with prayer. , Friday evening Prof. Arvin S. Olin, of the State University, lectured on "The State and the Teacher." Tbe teacher's relation to tbe commonwealth is more important thau that of any other citizen, because in his hands largely is the des tiny of the young people. Tbe trend of public thought is to bet ter civilization, and this can be accom plished through t,the proper training of tbe school children. And the character of the school teacher must be up to the highest standard of human excellence. The teacher must be graceful as well as intellectual. He must .possess tho.-e qualities which is desired the child should have. Tbe old officers of the association were re-elected. They are named : Presideut A.C. Wheeler, Garden City. Vice President W. M. Seaman, Kins ley. Secretary Miss Lulu Pine, Dodge City. Treasurer Mrs. K. V. Miller, Cimar ron. The association will meet in Kinsley next year. A good time was had, and it is believed that these meetings accomplish much good. The exchange of methods and thoughts and the social meetings tend to promote a good feeling among the teachers. Saved His Life. "I wish to say that I feel I owe my life to Kodol Dyspepsia Cure," writes H. C Chiestensoii. of Hayfield, Minn.

Just before Christmas is a good time to enter tbe matrimonial state. "Any time is good, but some times are better. When you get ready is also a good time. We have several marriages to note. Morris Nay lor and Miss Pearl Orebabgb, of Hodgeman, were united by Judge Finley on Thursday last. . Why . our Hodgeman county friends come to Ford to bind themselves we do not know, "un less it is because Judge Finley makes such a firm knot, that it is not easily tin tied.

About two years ago Arthur Rohrbaugb. contested the claim in Foote township on which lie now lives. lie won the con test and in due course of time tbe former entry was cancelled, and Mr. Rohrbaugh was notified by the local land office that he would be given 30 days in which to file on the laud. . He made immediate settlement ou the land but failed to file within the prescribed time, and, in fact, had not yet tiled when a few weeks ago Miss Katie Paris appeared at the Dodge City land office for the purpose of exer cising her homestead rights by filing on a quarter section of government land iu Gray county. The records of the office showed the land occupied by Rohrbaugh to be vacant, and Miss Paris made formal entry on the tract, not knowing, so she alleges, that Mr. Rohrbaugh was living 011 it. She claims to have first discovered this fact when she went to inspect the land, after tbe filing bad been made. The situation was explained to Mr. Rohr baugb and tbe interested parties called on the land office officials to see if the mat ter could uot be fixed up iu some way. They were informed that Miss Paris could not relinquish her claim to the land without " loosing her rights. If the higher authorities takes tbe same view of the case and Rohrbaugh is compelled to give up the claim it will work a severe hardship upon him, as he had resided upon and improved the bind for nearly two years, and has a house, barn and well on the place. It is to be hoped the mat ter may be amicably. and equitably ad justed. Gray County Seutitiel. If Mr. Rohrbaugh Ts not already a mar ried man we would suggest that be and and Miss Paris make a matrimonial alli ance, as the best way out of the difficulty, and then both would retain their rights.

Nov. 28- Geo Wallace is a uot her fellow who predicts a mild winter. He has lived in this country about twenty-three years, and 6ays be lias never yet known a bard winter follow a light hay crop. We hope be is right. The County Superintendent issued a temporary third grade certificate to Miss Gilpin, of Fort Dodge, last Saturday, and Monday of this week the young lady commenced a term of school at Cayo. L. O. Sutton," tbe fellow who does things, was in town. Saturday, and made tbe Sentinel a pleasant half hour's visit. He reports everything in a flourishing condition down at Cave. There is an abundance of feed,, and tbe people are starting into the winter in good shape. The Cimarron mill draws consider able trade to the old town, aud Mr. Zellers is entitled to a great deal of credit for his persistent efforts to maintain a high standard product. Our people should use tbe flour made by the Cimar ron Roller Mills s.nd speak a good word for it whenever an opportunity presents itself. There may De - worse diseases than diarrhoea of ttie mouth, but we doubt it very much. There's a man in this town afflicted with a bad case of it, and be seems to grow worse as be grows older. Constant abuse of friends aud tbe des truction of poor whisky appear to be his main objects in life. There is nothing he doesn't know, aud nothing too mean - for him to say. But there is this consolation no one believes or cares wbat be says. His tongue wags away like the clapper iu an old cow bell and tbe lies and scan dals wbicb he utters do not find lodgement even in bis own heart, for alas! he believes not wbat he says. Whisky drinking in Cimarron bas reached such an alarming stage that the business men, tipplers, topers and gradu ated drunkards thoroughly impressed with the gravity of the situation have, after due deliberatiou, decided to unite in an effort to curtail the consumption of intoxicants and suppress tbe illegal sale of the same. Moral suasion will first be employed, and legal force lesorted to if necessary. The plan, as it has been ex plained to us, is a good one, and if pro perly carried out will undoubtedly bear rich and abundant fruit aud ultimately result in bettering the moral and finan cial condition of many, both old and youug, and remove from our little town the 6tigma cast upon it by reason of its reputation as being "the worst whisky drinking town in Kansas." That there is too much whisky drank here is undeni ably true, and that baneful results'are sure to follow if a halt is uot called is equally certain. The plan proposed is a novel one, and will win. The movement is not to be fathered by any certain church, organization or body, but all will be invited to take part in tbe laudable work. Several drinking men have already signified their intention of join ing the movement and will do all in their power to make a success of the work. Everybody, old and young, male and female, will be invited to take part, and as soon as the necessary preliminaries are arranged a mass meeting will be held to start the ball rolling. Temperance fana tics are expected to stand aloof. The President's suggestion, in liis mes sage, that the government control irriga tion, meats much to the West. Saved At Grave's Brink.
