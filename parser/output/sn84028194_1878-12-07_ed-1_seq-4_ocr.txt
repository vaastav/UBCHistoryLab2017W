The nemnrisnt rmcificAtifin irf the" flnhnfitr hv the complete protection of all citisens i very civil and political right continues to be of para mount interest with the great body of onr peo ple. Every step in this direction is welcomed with public approval, and every interruption of steady and uniform progress to the desired con summation awakens general uneasiness and widespread condemnation.. . The recent Gonmes sionsl elections have furnished a direct and trust worthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical establishment of the right of suffrage, secured by the Constitution to the liberated race in the- Southern States. - All disturbing influ ences, real or imaginary, had been removed from all of these States. The three constitutional amendments, which conferred freedom and equality of civil and po litical rights upon the colored people of the South, were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizens who maintained the authority of the National ftnvpmmeYvt nnfl the integrity and perpetuity of the Union tf ti rasrai treasure ana lire, as a wise ana necessary embodiment in the organic law of she Just results of the war.

The friends of law and order looked f orward to the conduct of these elections, as offering to the general judgment of the country an important opportunity to measure the degree in which the right of suffrage could be exercised by the colored people, and would be respected by their fellow citizens: but a more general enjoyment of freedom of sufirage by thecolored people, shd a more just and generous protection at that freedom bv the nommnnities or-wnicn tney-rorm a part. -were generally antici- iwu ouiui uw tecoru ot tne election aiscioses. In some of those States in which the colored people have been nnabie to make their opinions felt in the elections, the result is mainly due to influences not easily measured or remedied by legal protection; but in the States of Louisiana and South Carolina at large, and in some Con gressional Districts outside of those States, the records of the elections seem to compel the con clusion that the rights ef the colored voters have been overriden, and their participation in the elections not permitted to be either general or free. It will be for the Congress for which these elections were held, to make such examinations into their conduct as may be appropriate to de termine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it becomes the duty of the Executive and Judicial Departments of the Government . each in its province, to in quire into and punish violations of the laws of the United States which have occurred. I can but repeat what I have said in this connection in my last message, that whatever authority rests with me tw this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to torego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the courts, the execu tive authorities, and the nennle of the KtAten where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their assistance toward' bringing to' justice the offenders and preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of toe auegea -crimes, ana to secure toe conviction and just punishment of the guilty. It is to be observed that the principal appro priation made for the Department of Justice at the last session contained the following clause: . And for defraying the expenses which may be mcurred in the enforcement of the act approved February twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, entitled, " An act to amend an act approved Mav thirtieth, eighteen hundred and seventy, entitled An act to enforce the rights of wuMUBui mi; uruwu Dtates to vote in tne sev eral States of the Union, and for other Dornows.' or any acts amendatory thereof or supplement ary tnereto. ... It is the opinion of the Attorney General that uie expenses 01 tnese proceeaings will largely ex ceed the amonnt which wan thnn rtnwirled and 1 rely confidently upon Congress to make adequate amiiUIUiauuUH W BOH1UQ JLJUKUUVe lepaXt- uicuit to euxoroe-sne laws. -j ti i . j. m I respectfully "urge upon your attention that the Congressional elections, in every District, in a very important sense, are justly a matter of political interest and concern throughout the wnoie country. iach State, every political party, is entitled to the share of power which is confer red by the legal and Constitutional suffrage. It is tne ngnt 01 every citizen, possessing the qual ifications nreanriheri hv law tn east one nnin. timidated ballot, and to have his ballot hnnesr.lv counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal, practically as well as formally, nnhmin. sion ti the Tesulte of the suffrage will be ao cornea royally ana cheerfully -and all the De partments of Government wfll feel the true, vigor or tne popular wilt thus ex pressed,-No temporary or administrative "in te rests or government, nowever urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our peo ple in defense of the primary rights of citizen ship.

FOSBISN KBLATIOVS- i Our relations with other countries continue peaceful. Onr neutrality in contests between foreign powers has been maintained and re spected. The Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been attended by large num bers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the preparation and arrangement of the con tributions of our citizens to this great Exposi tion was well employed in .energetic and judi cious efforts- te overcome this disadvantage.' These efforts, led and directed by the Commissioner-General, were remarkably successful, and the exhibition of the products of-American in dustry was creditable and gratifying in scope and character. The reports of the United States Commissioners, giving its results in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this international competition for the favor and trade of the world may be expected to: produce useful and important results, in promoting intercourse, friendship and commerce with other nations. In accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28, 1878. three commissioners were appointed to an international conference on the subject of adopting a common ratio between gold and silver; for the- purpose of establishing, internationally, - the use of bimetallic money, and securing fixity of relative value between those metals. . Invitations were addressed to the various Gov ernments which had expressed a willingness to Earticipate in its deliberations. The conference eld its meeting in Paris in August last. The re port or the lyommissioners, herewith submitted, will show its results. No common ratio between f old and silver could be agreed upon by the con erence. Tne Ereneral nnnclnainn waa rene.hen1 that it is necessary to maintain in the world the rnpnetary xunctions or silver aa well as gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the other of these two metals, or of both, to be maae Dy eacn otate. . . fOhgress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000 to pay the award of the Joint Commission at Halifax, if, after corre spondence with the British Government, on the subject of the oonformity of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question thereby submitted to the Commis sion, the President shall deem it his duty to make the payment, communi cations upon these points were addressed to the British Government 1 through the legation of the United States at London. Fail ing to obtain the eonourrence of the British "Government in the views of this Government respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named, within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by notice of the grounds of payment, and a protest against any other construction of the same. The correspond ence upon this subject will be laid before you.

Confident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity. Which it is earnestly "hoped may prove well founded. Nu JJ erotl cfoims of American citizens for relief lor injuries or restoration of property have been among the incidents of the long-continued hos tilities, Borne of these claims are in process of adjustment by Spain, and the others are prom ised early and careful consideration. The treaty made with Italy, in regard to ciprocal consular privileges, has been diily rati fied and proclaimed, . : . No questions of feraW Importance have arisen with any other of the European poers. The Japanese Government has been desirous Of a, revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and, it is understood, has addressed to each of the treaty powers a request to open negotiations with that view. The United BtatiM tjrtverhment has been inclined to regard the matter favorably. What ever restrictions upon trade with Japan are found injurious to that people cannot but affect injur iously nations holding commercial intercourse with them: Japan, after a long period of seclu sion, has within the oast few veara made Tanid strides in the path of enlightenment and pro gress, and, not unreasonably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be assimilated to those which thev hold with each other A treatv looking to this end has been made, which will be submitted for the consideration of the Senate.

In the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act ap proved February 25, 1862, which requires that one per cent, of the entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compli ance with the conditions of the law. By its terms, the public debt should have been re duced between 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year, $518,361 ,866.28; the actual reduction of the ascertained debt, in that period, has been $720, 644,739.61 ; being in excess of the reduction re quired by the sinking fund act, 202,282,983.33.

Such a pro vision of law,irrtrjorted by suitable regulations; would enable any person readily , withfJvrt costrot risk, to convert his money into an interest-bearing security of the United States, and the money so received could be applied to the rede uiptiuu of 6 pw cent, bonds.? 7 j&t V i The coinage ot gold during -the last fiscal year was $52,798,980.

ARMY. The report of the Secretary of War shows that the armv has been well and economically sun- plied, that our small f oroe has been actively em ployed, and has taitnruiiy pertormed all the service required of it. The morale of the army has improved, and the number of desertions has materially aecreasea auring tne year. The Recretarv recommends: 1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lrierui.

The report calls at tention to the fact that the compensation of Postmasters and of railroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and that the failure of Congress to appropriate the amounts required for these purposes does not relieve the. Govern ment of responsibility but necessarily increases the deficiency bills which Congress will be called Upoh to pass; , in 1 nroViriiriff frtr the ttnstal service: the follow ing questions are presented: Should Congress annually appropriate a - sum for its expenses largely in excess Of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be established as will make the department self-sustaining? Should the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way . tstiouia tne number of post-routes be diminished? Should other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or diminish the expenses of the postal servicer. . The International fostal tjonrress. which met in Paris May 1, 1878, and continued in session until June 4. of the same year, was comnosed of delegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted a new convention, to take the place of the treaty amended at Berne, Oct. 9, 1874, which goes in to. effect on the 1st of April, 1879, between the countries whrtRe deleirateR haveaifrrl- ed it. It was ratified ana approved, by and with the consent of the President. Aug. 13, 1878. A Synopsis of this Universal Postal Convention will be found in the report of the Postmaster General, and the full text in the appendix there to, in its origin tne i oti uuioii comprised twenty-three countries, having a population of 350,000,000 of people On the 1st of April next it u-ill enrnnrise fortv-three countries and colonies. with a population of more than 650,000.000 of peo ple, and will soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colonies which.main- tain organizea postal service, constitute., in tact as well as in name, as its new title inaicates, a Universal Union. re?ulatintz. upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postal inter course between all civilized nations. Some embarrassment has arisen out of the conflict between the customs laws of this coun try and the provisions of the PoBtal Convention, in regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by mail. It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some means of reconciling the difficulties which have thus been created, bo as to do justice to all par ties involved. . . . i .- : - i THE

The en cumbered condition of these dockets is presented anew in the report of the Attorney-General, and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged for Con nrrenKionfl.1 aetion.

The annnal renorte of the Secretary of the In terior and of the Commissioner of Indian Af fairs present an elaborate account of the pres ent condition of the Indian tribes and of that branch of the public service which ministers to their interests. While the conduct of the In dians, generally, has been orderly, and their re lations witn t.1 H 1 1 lie l 4 1 1 1 , oi n 1 1 it: ii vi a v auu ikw f ul. two local disturbances have occurred which were deplorable in their character, but remainea hannilv. confined to a comparatively small num ber of Indians. The discontent among the Ban nocks, which led first to some acts of violence on the part of some members of the tribe,and finally to the outbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food on the reservation, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy ot the appropriations made by Congress to the wants , ot the maians at a time when the Indians were prevented from supplying the deficiency by hunting. After an arduous pursuit by the troops of the United Htatea and aeveral enlargements, the hostile In dians were reduced to subjection, and Jihe larger part of them -surrendered themselves as prison ers. In this connection I desire to call attention to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior that a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of the Executive, to be used, with proper accountability, at discretion, in sudden emergencies of the Indian service. Tne other case of disturbance was that of band of Northern Chevennes who suddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rapidly throngh the States of Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their old hunting grounds, committing murders and other crimes on their way. From documents accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior, it appears that this disorderly band was as fully supplied with the necessaries of life as the 4,700 other Indians who remained quietly on the reser vation, and that the disturbance was caused by men of a restless and mischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of this band have surrendered to the mili tary authorities, and It is a gratifying fact that. when Borne of them had. taken refuse in the camp of the Bed Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the contrary notwitnstandmg, tney nave urn formlv ahown ever since the wishes thev ex pressed at the council of September, 1877, have been complied with. Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Sec retarv of War nnite in the recommendation that provision be made by Congress for the organi- UltllNl O L Q 1,111 I'" Ul

Such an organization would materially aid tne army in tne accompiisnment of a task for which its numerical strength is sometimes foDnd insufficient. But. while the emnlovment of forces for the prevention or repression of Indian troubles, is of 'occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humano and civilizing agen cies tor the ultimate solution ot what is called the Indian problem. It mav be very difficult. and require much patient effort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the re straints of civilized life, but experience shows that it is not impossible. . Many ., of the ; tribes which are . now . quiet and orderly and self-supporting . were once as savage as any that at present roam over thenlains or in the mountains of the far West. and were then considered inaccessible to civiliz ing influences, it may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white population of the United States; but we should not forget that thev are the aborigines of the country, and 'called the soil their own on which our peo- le have grown rich, powerful ana nappy. Ve owe it to them as a moral duty to helD them in attaining at least tnat aegree or civiliza tion which thev mav be able to reach. It is not only our duty it is also our interest to do so. Indians woo have become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an interest in property, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and disturbing element. It is also a well authenticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the ex pressions of Indians themselves and from many concurring reports, that there is a steadily in- Creasing desire, even among Indians belonging to comparatively wna trioes. to nave ineircnuuren educated. 1 invite attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, touching the experiment recently inaugurated, in taking nrty ina an cmiaren, boys and girls, from different tribes, ' to trie iiampioa - rsonnai Agricultural insti tute, in Virginia, where - they are to re ceive an elementary English education and train ing m agriculture ana otner useiai work, to De returned to their tribes, after the completed course, as interpreters, instructors, and examples. It is reported that the officer charged with the selection of those children might have had thou sands of young Indians sent with him had it been nossible to make provision for them. I aaree with the Secretary of the Interior in saying that LUC result oi iui luiereeiiuK cpcriuieub, 11 ja- voraDle. mav oe destined to rjecome an important factor in the advancement of civilization among toe lnaians. The auestion whether a change in the control of the'Indian service should be made was, at the last session oi congress, reierrea to a com mittee for inquiry and report. Without - desir ing to anticipate that report. I venture to exnress the houe that in the decision of so lm portant a question, the views expressed above may not be lost sight of, and that the decision, whatever it may be, will anest further, agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to pro duce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indians themselves. , - THE HOT SPRINGS, ' In the enrollment of the bill making aDnronna- tions for sundry civil expenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided for the continuation of the Hot Springs commission was omitted. As the commission had completed the work of taking testimony on the many conflicting Claims, tne suspension oi tneir laoors, Deiore de termining the rights ot the claimants, threatened. for a time, to embarrass the interests, not only of the Government, but also of a large number of the citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action of their claims before beginning con templated Improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties, which were apprehended, and the solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot - Springs, and others interested in the welfare of the town, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to request the late com missioners to take charge of the records of their. proceedings, ana to periorin sucn work as coma properly be done by them under such circum stances, to facilitate the future adjudication of the claims at an early day, and to preserve the status of the claimants until their rights should be finally determined. The late commissioners com plied with that request, and report that the testi mony, in all the cases, has been written out, ex amined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that the requisite authority be given at as early a day in the session as possible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the late commissioners for the expense incurred aud the la bor performed by them since the 25th of June last. THE PUBLIC TIMBER. I invite the attention of Congress to the recom mendations made by the Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the timber -on the public lands of the United States. The pro tection of the public property is one of the first duties of the Government. The Department of the Interior should, therefore, be enabled by sufficient appropriations, to enforce the laws in that respectL-Hut- tbia-juatter--appeatiU-mor-important as a question of public economy. The rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially in the mountainous districts, where the rocky- slopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so for ever. There the injury, once done, cannot be repaired. I fully concur wih the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that, for this reason, legis lation touching the public timber in the moun tainous States and Territories of the West, should be especially well considered, and that existing laws, in which the destruction of the forests is not sufficiently guarded against, should be speedily modified. A general law concerning this important subject, appears to me to he a mat ter of urgent public necessity.. , . , , , . "AGRICULTURE. From the organization of the Government, the importance of encouragiug. by all possible means, the increase of our agricultural productions, has been acknowledged and urged upon the attention of Congress and the people as the surest and readiest means of increasing our substantial and enduring prosperity. . . f. ' 'The words of Washington are as applicable to day as when, in his eighth annual message, he said: '-It is not to be doubted that with reference either to individual or national welfare, agricul ture is of primary importance. In proportion as nations advance, in population and other circum stances of maturity, this truth becomes more ap parent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage. In stitutions for -promoting it grow-up, supported by the public purse and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety T Among the means which have been employed to this end none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of boards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting aud diffusing information, and enabUjd, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, ' t) encourage, ffld .assist; the - spirit of - discovery and Im j rovem nt. this species of establishment contribu ting doubly to the increase of improvement by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common center the results every where of individual ski 11 and observation, ana spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experience accordingly bath shown that they are very cheap instruments ef immense national bene- The great preponderance of the agricultural, dver any other interest in the United States enti tles it to all the consideration claimed fdf it by Washington. About one-half of the popula tion of the United States is engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural prod nets of the United States for the year 1878, is estimated at $3,000,000,000. The exports of agri cultural products for the year 1877, as appears from the report of the Bureau of Statistics, were $d4,uuu,uuu. 'ine great extent or our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables ns to produce within our own borders, and by our own labor, not only the necessaries but most of the luxuries mat are cuusumeu m civmzeu wiuiiiice. Yet, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, cli mate and inter-communication, it appears from the statistical statements in the report of the Com missioner of Agriculture, that we import annually from foreign lands many rr.illions of dollars' Worth of agricultural products which could be raised in our own country. If umerouB questions arise in tne practice ei ad vanced agriculture which can only be answered by experiments, often costly and sometimes fruit less, wnica are neyona me meaun ui private m dividuals, and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It is good policy, especially in times of depression and uncertainty in otner ousiness pursuits, witn a vast area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage by every proper and legitimate means, the occupation and tillage of the soil. The efforts of the Department of Agriculture to stimu late old and introduce new agricultural industries, to Improve the quality and increase the quantity of ourproducts, to determine the value of old or establish the importance -of new methods of cul ture, are wort ay oi your caret m anu lavoravie con sideration and assistance, by such appropriations of money and enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the present favorable conditions for the growth and rapid development oi tnis important interest.

EDUCATION.. - The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows very gratifying progress throughout the country, in all the interests com mitted to the care of this Important office. The report is especially encouraging with respect to the extension of the advantages of a common school system, in sections of the country where the general enjoyment oi tne privilege oi iree scnoois s not yet attained To education more than to any other agency we are to look, as the resource for the advancement of the people, in the requisite knowledge and ap preciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and 1 desire to repeat the suggestion con tained in my former message in behalf of the en actment of appropriate measures by Congress for the pnrpose of supplementing, with national aid, the local systems of education in the several States. Adequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing the capacity of the rooms now occupieu at tne capital, suouiu oe pruviueu without further delay. This invaluable collection of books. manuscriDts and illustrative art. has grown to such proportions, in connection with the copyngut system ot tne country, as to uemanu tne prompt and careful attention of Congress to save it from injury in its present crowded and insuffi cient quarters. As this library is national in its character, and must, from the nature of the case. increase even more rapidly in tue future man in the past, it cannot be doubted that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness. The appeal of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the means to organize, exhibit, and make available for the public benefit the articles now stored away belonging to the Rational Museum, I heartily recommend to your favorable consideration. - " DISTRICT or COLUMBIA. The attention of Congress is again invited to the condit ion of the river-front of the city of Washing ton. It is a matter of vital importance to the health of the residents of the National Capital, both temporary and permanent, that the low lands in front of the city, now subject to tidal over-flow, should be reclaimed. In their present condition, these flats obstruct the drainage of the city, and are a dangerous source of malarial poison. The reclamation win improve tne navigauou ui uie river, by restricting and consequently deepening its channel; and is also of importance, when con sidered in connection with the extension of the public ground and the enlargement of the park, west and south of the Washington monument. The report of the Board of Survey, heretofore vruereu uy kvi ui MjugreBD, ,111 iuc iiujiiu,cwcui of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is respectfully commended to consideration. The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents a detailed statement of the affairs of the 1 dstrict. The relative expenditures by the United States and the District- for local purposes is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the people of the District greatly exceed those of the General Government. The exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the requisite repair of the de fective pavements and sewers of the city, which is a work of immediate necessity, and, in the same connection, a plan is presented for the permanent funding of the outstanding securities of the District. ' The benevolent, reformatory, and penal lntttu tions of the District are all entitled to the favor able attention of Congress. The Reform School needs additional buildings and teachers. Appro priations which will place all of these institutions in a couriition to become models of usefulness and beneficence, will be regarded by the country as liberality wisely bestowed. . i The Commissioners, with evident justice, re quest attention to the discrimination made by Congress against the District in the donation of land for the support of the public schools, and ask that the same liberality that has been shown to the inhabitants of the various States and Territories of the United States may be extended to the Di s trict of Columbia. . ..... ... The commissioners also invite a'tention to the damage inflicted upon public and private in terests by the present location of the depots and switching tracks of the several railroads entering the city, and ask for legislation looking to their removal. The recommendations and suggestions contained in the report will, I trust, receive the careful consideration of Congress. 1 Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed-since the - reorganization of the Governmentof the District, under the recent legislation of Con gress, for the expression of a confident opinion as to its successful operation: but the practi cal results already attained are so satisfac tory that the friends of the new Government may well urge upon Congress the wisdom of its continuance, without essential modification, un til, by actual experience, its advantages and de fects may be more fully ascertained. . R. B. Hayes. . Executive Mansion, Dee. 2, 1878. ' .Stick to Tour Farm. , Trade in manufactured goods is play ing some queer pranks nowadays. A man or a company may work hard, ex pending much time and money in per fecting some article of general use, and suddenly find that elsewhere some one has been at the same wort and can sell the results for less money. A few years ago England was the only country which manufactured cotton prints for export, while the idea of any one com' peting with her in her home markets was laughed at as a bit of insanity; Utit to-day American prints are being worn by operatives in .English cotton mills, having been found to be prettier, better and cheaper. Now we hear that agents of German, cutlers have been to Shef field, heretofore the acknowledged cen ter of the cutlery trade of the world, and sold their goods at prices which the home manufacturers could not un derbid. Sheffield will continue to make knives and scissors, and no American will be foolish enough to hope that the English print works will be closed, but the illustrations which we have given of the fluctuations of trade will show the American farmer that businesses which he mornfully considers more profitable than his own are subject to drawbacks and dangers which the agri culturist never knows. Breadstuffs and food materials of every kind are always in demand, and have a tolerably uni form value the world over, jno com petition, no new farming community that may be developed, can ever afflict farmers with a "lock-out" such as workers in the trades are constantly experiencing, nor in tremendous fail ures like those which are constantly startling the commercial world. The overstocked manufacturer cannon eat his superfluous knives or prints, nor can the locked out operative dine on his tools, but in the worst season the farmer is sure at least of a full stomach and a roof over his head. Sensible is he if instead of grumbling at his lot he makes the best of it and realizes how in the Ions run he is better off than many whose occasional , success he en vies. Jx: jr. jieraca.

One must have a vessel large enough to hold the milk. It may be any clean tub, boiler or kettle. A Wooden tub is best, because it will lose the least heat while standing. There must be means for warming, which can be supplied by a cook stove. , Rennet for coagulating the milk must be pro vided and soaked beforehand. A strong hoop for pressing the curd, with a ca pacity of at least six cubic inches for every quart of milk used, and power for pressing equal to at least the weight of a ton. These being: provided, warm the milk in any convenient way, with out burning, to about eighty-four de grees, and add rennet enough to have it begin to curdle in fifteen minutes, and cover the milk to keep it from cool ing. The quantity of rennet to use must be found by trial. When the curd has becomeso hard as to cleave before the finger when passed through' it, it should be , cut with a blade that will reach to the bottom of the vessel into columns an, inch or so square, and then covered again to let the whey separate. After it has stood fifteen or twenty min utes, the whey which can be conven iently removed may be dipped off, and the curd carefully broken, with the hands into pieces the size of chestnuts or even finer. ' When this is done the whey which has been dipped off,, or what is better, an equal bulk of water, heated to .150 degrees, may be turned into the curd and stirred enough to make all parts of the . curd warm up alike. The curd should again be cov ered to prevent cooling, and left stand ing fifteen or twenty minutes, or so long as it can be without sticking firmly to gether, when the whey may again be .dipped , off, the , curd broken, up fine again, and more hot whey or . water turned on and mixed evenly so' as not to rile the whey and waste the richness of the curd. Cover the curd again and repeat the operation till the mass is raised to blood 'heat. The stirring should be repeated often enough to pre vent the pieces of curd from adherin and the whole covered and left stand ing for the curd to hardens When it has; stood so long as to become hard enough to squeak between the teeth or spring apart readily when pressed in the hand, the whey may be at once dipped off and the curd "drained on a strainer cloth laid over something which will allow the whey to run off steadily, like a large sieve or a basket. When the curd has been stirred till it is freed from whey and becomes a little cool and the large lumps broken up fine so it wilj. receive salt about alike, salt at the rate of one ounce for each ten quarts of milk. Mix the salt thor oughly through the curd and then put to press. As soon as the curd is well stuck together, so it can be handled safely, remove it from the press, put on a new press-cloth, turn the under side up, fold the cloth evenly over it and press again till the press is wanted ror the next day's cheese. Upon taking it from the press let it stand an hour or two till it becomes dry, then rub it over with some 1 soft grease, and turn and rub daily tilt it is cured, which will be in from thirty to sixty days.

These were generally tested and ap proved by the large attendance, and elicited from the lady members a re quest for the modus operandi of mak ing, with hints as to the best yeast, etc, Uonrad w uson said that the samples of bread submitted to the club by Mrs, Wilson were intended to illustrate the economic value of this form of food and to show the capacity of these cereals for the production of bread. Liet us now glance at some of the fig ures, and hrst for corn. When good, sound corn is properly prepared and made into bread, by the atest and best methods, it is found that the gain in weight of the bread above the meal from which it id made is over 100 per cent. In other words, a pound of corn bread is the product of less than, half a pound of corn meal, and conse quently a bushel of corn weighing 60 pounds, and talten at ntty pounds net over the toll, will yield 100 pounds of bread. But when wheat flour is blended with the meal, which is very usual, the ratio of bread to gram is slightly di minished. ' i - .-! , . Assuming the cost of corn to be 30 cents a bushel on a general . average, this would bring the cost of the bread for the lowest grade of the samples submitted : to one-third of a cent ' a pound- for the meal, making a ' total, when the other ingredients are in cluded, of about one cent; while for the better sample with' its' additional in gredients, the total cost would be about two cents. For wheat bread the figures are different. ..... , , -., In a bushel of wheat weighing 60 pounds, it is commonly assumed that the net weight -of flour, after allowing for the bran, shorts and toll, is about 40 pounds. But when flour is con verted into bread, the gain of weight varies from 50 to 70 per cent. - At this rate of increase, the quantity of bread from a bushel of wheat would be from 60 to 68 pounds over and above the bran and the - toll for grinding. . Ac cording to the actual gain in Mrs: Wil son's sample, a busnei ot wheat would yield 65 pounds of bread. ; : mis gain oi weignt is oi course uue to the absorption of water by the flour, and is therefore no positive addition to the amount of nutriment. Yet it is found in practice that the greater the absorption, the Better, as a general rule, is the quality of the bread. Assummg the cost ot wheat to be io cents a bushel on a general average, this would make the cost of the bread less than 1 cents a pound, which is more than the cost of the inferior grade of corn bread, but less than the cost of the better quality. If now we assume the yield per acre to be, for corn 70 bushels, and for wheat 30 bushels (both of which I claim to be -entirely possible for average farmers), then we have the following food results: , D or corn bread, v.uuu pounds - per acre, at a cost tor tne lower grade of $70, and for the better quality of nearly double that amount. - i, For wheat bread, about 2,000 pounds,' at a cost of $30. Now if we assume that a farmer's family numbers five persons of various afrpa f afii-iitralanr. nn an .VMarA tn frtliiT adults), and allow two pounds of bread per day to each, as equivalent to their support, then an acre -of corn would sustain the family for over 800 days, and an acre of wheat 250 days. In other words, half an acre of " corn, or one and a half acres of wheat would maintain the family for one year. There , are; possibly some doubting farmers who will shake their: heads at these conclusions, and hesitate to ac cept them. " Yet I am prepared to show that the figures . here given are in re ality below the truth, and that these cereals are capable of better results than I have indicated. JV. Jr. World.
