PRICE FIVE CENTS emu WAD COMES WITH REVOLT AGAINST BOLSHEVIKI REVISION OF TAX LAW IN MONTANA COMMISSION AIM Attorney General to Interpret Present Statute Which Is Ambiguous. 

AMENDMENT MAY BE DECIDED NECESSARY Abolition Mortgage Tax and Equality of Public Serv ice Tax Is Aim. a Helena, Dec. 9.—Recommendations for important changes in the. lax laws of Montana were agreed upon by the members of the state tax commission and the state board of equaiizaMon at ttie joint session just conducted here. Whether these changes can be brought about, at the next session of the legislature will depend upon the construction that is placed on the state constitution. Constitution Ambigiouc. In one place the constitution provides that revenues shall be derived from a uniform rate of assessment and taxa tion of all property, while another place the constitution provides that a uni form tax shall be levied upon the same class of subjects. ]I the latter provision of the constitution is the one under which the legislature may make enactments, then the recommendations decided upon by the tax commission may be written upon the statute books of the state at the next legislative session, but if the former provision is followed, it is believed that the con stitution would have to Is» amended before proposed changes could be made. The commission will ask Attor ney General S. ('. Ford for an opinion on the interpretation of the constitu tion before definite recommendations to the legislature are decided upon. May Abolish Mortgage Tax. The abolition of the "'mortgage tax" is one of the most far reaching changes proposed. Under the present laws the assessor goes to the records and takes off a list of the mortgages. These are assessed to the mortgagees. If the mortgagees happen to live outside of the state, which most of them con trive to do, the tax cannot be col lected. "The revenue derived from assess ing mortgages amount to very little,'' said one member of the tax commis sion, "but the. system has a strong tendency to keep up interest on pri vate loans. The mortgagee always de mands a higher rate contending that he must pay taxes to the state for the loan." Substitute Registration Tax. Instead of taxing mortgages and notes, as is now done, the commis sion has proposed a registration tax on all mortgages. No definite figure has been fixed, but tentatively it has been agreed that the fee shall bo 50 cents for each $100. The commission reached no conclusion as to what percentage of the fees so collected shall go to the state and to the county, respectively". \ The question of how to assess money on hand or deposit in a bank has long been a stumbling block. The tax "commision agreed that it would recommend to the legislature t liât a law be enacted whereby money lie assessed SO cents on the $100 , Montana, under the present taxation system, is deriving so little revenue front the taxing of money that the in come is negligible. Public Service Companie*. Public service corporations of the state of Montana, are hereafter to lie put on an equal basis in the matter of paying taxes. The commission has de elded to go to the books of the county nsse sors to get figures, so that all concerns may be made to bear their just share of the taxes. Members of (he tax commission after some investi Ration along tills line say that many public service corporations have one valuation for rate making and another for taxation purposes. IFrequently there is a wide difference between the two valuations. » investigations of the assessment rolls of the counties lo get data for fixing valuations for public servie corporations and also for other kind of property" will liegin about Marc 1. The members of the commission are to conduct their own investiga tlons so far as it is practicable. Permanent Tax Commission. Another proposed innovation is the creation of a permanent tax commis sion. It would have rharge of the levying of taxes, the collection thereof . and would also to a large extent be given control of the expenditures of all state moneys. The creation of the commission would carry with it the budget system for carrying on the financial business of the state. The honor system of assessing is one of the proposed changes on which the tax commission is heartily agreed. The Weather Monday, Doe. 10.—Sun rises at 7:54; sun sets a 5:04.

In quiry by government experts has es tablished, it was said, that the col lision was accidental.

A torrential rain flooded Halifax at daylight today. Accompanied by a 50-mile gale, it added greatly to the sufferings of thousands of persons who had found none too sure shelter after the destruction of their homes Thurs day by the explosion on the ammuni tion laden steamer Mont Blanc in the harbor here.
