Of this amount half was saved and half lost. The number of] disasters involving the total loea of vessels, was 5,428. The number of disas ters to vessels, 217, is the greatest of that of any previous year, the highest former num ber having been 171.

These copies were distributed last Thurs day, under seal, with strict instructions to telegraph operators not to break the seals until permission was given by telegraph, which permission was to follow the delivery of the message in congress. Through some omission the Sioux City Journal and the Press and Dakotaian did not receive their quota of the advance copies sent out, which is all the more aggravating the way the matter has resulted. Through some other source the papers of New York, Cincinnati and Chicago procured possession of advance copies, and their this morning's issues contained the message in full. The following telegrams received by us this morning from William Henry Smith, ex plains the affair: "Chicago, Dec. 1.—The premature publi cation of the annual message of the mes sage of the president in New York, Chicago and Cincinnati, compels delivery to you without further delay of the copies in the .. hands of our. agents. The faith of the asso ciated press, which I personally pledged to the president, has been sacredly observed to the moment by all intraKtsd with the care of the message since Thursday.

For the convenience of the newspaper fraternity and to assist in placing the annual message quickly before the people, President Hayes cauaed a large number of copies to be print ed and circulated, through the medium of trusted agents, in. advance of its delivery. He was doubtless the victim of deep cha ,£griu this mornitag, on discovering thst most of the leading newspapers of the land h»d taken advantage of .his endeavor to serve them and anticipated the delivery of his message by several hours. As news paper publishers we are greatly obliged to Mr. 8mith ior permission to use the mes sagethis morning, but as the mails failed to firing it to us, it remains for as to either wait another day or procure it by wire. One thing is certain—tbe president can never accuse Yankton and Sioux City of premature publication of his document. AN

He does $100 worth of advertising for a railroad, gets a 'pass' for a year, rides *25 worth then he is looked upon as a dead head, or a half blown dead beat. He 'pufii' a theatre or concert troupe $10 worth and gets $1.00 in 'complimentaries' and is thus passed in'free.' If the hall is small he is begrudged of the room he occupies—for if his 'complimentaries' were paying tickets the troupe Would be so much in pocket.
