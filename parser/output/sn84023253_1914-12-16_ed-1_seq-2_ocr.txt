M. train our teachers in agricultural and Industrial lines. Let Middlebury continue to give them excellent instruction in peda gogy academic teaching, and let Norwich maintain its engineering instructors." This is the sugges tion of the Rutland Herald in an swer to the suggestion of the Bel lows Falla Times that "Vermont ought to have a state university and but one, and that cne should be lo cated at Burlington." The Herald claims that it3 proposition is the recommendation of the educational commission, but we have not dis covered where the commission has recommended any state aid for Nor wich University. On the contrary, the commission did not recommend any aid for Norwich because that institution could perform no service for the state that is not already bet ter done at one of the other insti tutions. The commission has recommend ed the training of teachers for the secondary schools of the state by Middlebury College and the train ing of teachers of agriculture In the public schools at the University of Vermont. We question somewhat the wisdom of subsidizing even two Institutions for the training of teachers for Vermont. If the plans of the educational commission are carried out Vermont will have bet ter trained and equipped teachers in every grade of the public school, especially in the small rural school where the teacher Is almost the en tire educational equipment. In these schools, especially in the secondary schoolf, some form of agricultural instruction is to be given by teach ers trained and qualified for such work. Now if these teachers were to be trained in agricultural teaching at the University and in pedagogy at Middlebury, either the teachers will be trained in only one of these branches or must divide their time between the two institutions. Neith er of these results is desirable. Vermont schools will need young men and women trained in both pedgogy and agricultural instruc tion If it intends to make agricul tural instruction at all general. It would not be wise or economical to require one teacher to attend two In stitutions to get equipment for his work. Nor is it necessary as one Institution can be equipped for less than two institutions to do the en tire work. Further, why should the state pay a second institution to perform the same work that it is paying the Uni versity of Vermont through federal aid to do? The federal government is liberally helping the state in glv . ing instruction in agriculture and mechanical arts and the state ap propriates this money to the Uni versity of Vermont and State Agri cultural College. Having done this it seems hardly proper that the state should also help another institution in practically the same line of work because one well-equipped institu tion can handle it more economically and efficiently than two partially equipped institutions. When fully considered there seems o be more merit in the propo sition to have one state university located at Burlington than some peo ple are willing to admit. The American Army The American army is the sub ject of most animated discussion, and there are practically three propositions before the country at present- Congressman Gardner of Massachusetts is convinced there should be an investigation with full publicity regarding the prepared ness for war and makes some sensa tional ' statements in support of his contention. He makes it evident that action is needed but the house refused to support his plea for pub licity. Secretary of War Garrison in his annual report shows the Inadequacy of the present army to repel an in vasion of any size and that it would take at least six months to organize a sufficient force, a situation that would be fatal were an invasion un dertaken. He gives this sane defi nition of what our army should be. "Every nation must have adequate force to protect itself from domes tic Insurrection, to enforce its laws, and to repel invasion; that is, every nation that has similar characteris tics to those of a self respecting man." He urges that the United States army be recruited to its full war strength which would require an increase of 25,000 men and 1,000 officers. This would give the coun try an army of 120,000 men with an available mobile force of 50,000 men in continental United States. The artillery and artillery ammuni tion should be greatly increased. He also urges new legislation regarding enlistment and a reserve force, both in the regular army and the state militia. Sensible and convincing as Secre tary Garrison's statements and argu ments are, we are inclined to be lieve Senator John P. Weeks of Mas sachusetts outlined a better plan in a speech in the senate on Thursday last. He believes that the army and state militia should be reorganized so to give to the mobile army the proper proportion of infantry, field artillery, cavalry, engineers, signal, sanitary troops, the needed ammuni tion and supply trains, and provide for properly equipped depots. In this he and Secretary Garrison are probably in full accord but here is a more valuable suggestion. Sen ator Weeks said: "I am firmly impressed with the idea that haphazard legislation has too long been indulged in with ref erence to the development of our military resources; that the ques tions of policy, of economy in main tenance, of effectiveness in the cost ly machine which we are forced to maintain, have not been intelligently met certainly they have not been satisfactorily solved. "This requires some sort of na tional defence council, and I " am heartily in favor of seeing such a body legislated into prompt ' exis tence. Congress then would not be asked to provide for the policies and individual opinion of vary adminis trations and military committees which so far have been Ineffective and costly, but some definite scheme would be thought out for the eco nomical development and mainte nance of that part of our military resources considered necessary for our national defence.". Here we have efficiency, economy and consistency regarding the fighting force of the country. We believe it will be well for the coun try to silence the noisy mouthings of Congressman Weeks, go beyond the recommendations of Secretary Gar rison and begin the careful and scientific development of an ade quate army urged by Senator Weeks, ment aid for the development trade routes that has ever been success fully undertaken. Every American would be glad to have profitable trade developed with South Ameri ca but many believe the government should no more go into the shipping business than it should go into the cotton business or the production of food stuffs. It may with safety en courage private enterprise in these lines but it certainly cannot under take such business in its own name with any hope of success- Taken as a whole, the wording of the president's message was admir able, his hopes and ambitions are good, but his methods proposed give no promise of securing the wonder fully nice things he seems to hope they will. The president has not asked his party to grant any relief to the Industry of the country from the unfortunate condition in which they have placed it. He has simply commanded our industries to ad vance with a load they have already found greater than they could bear. American industry like the overload ed horse has simply received another command to advance when it knows it is impossible to do it. Xo Relief Promised The country awaited the annual message of President Wilson to con gress with much interest, because it was anxious to know whether or not the president realized that Amer ican industry was paralized by pres ent law, railroads are facing bank ruptcy because the government has persisted in destructive rather than constructive regulation and that the country faces serious complications on account of the chaotic conditions in Mexico. So far as his message is concerned, it is evident he does not. On the contrary he declares "the road at last lies clear and firm" but does not show that any of the in terests mentioned above has even discovered the "road." The president comes out firmly for the development of new shipping routes by the government and the retirement of the government from the business as soon as any private party wants it. This method has the virtue of novelty but is in direct opposition to any method of govern- The Governor and The Courts. Discussion, especially cussing, of the Governor's action in appointing judges of the courts does not abate in the state press. The Bennington Banner calls attention to the fact that it was not the legislature of 1912 that is responsible for allowing the selection of the judges to pass out of control of the legislature but the legislature of 1910. That the legislature of 1910 was the only one that could propose constitutional changes and that the legislature of 1912 could only approve of , the changes proposed two years earlier. This seems correct and makes the following bit of history pertinent. Allen M. Fletcher was a member of the special committee to propose constitutional changes to the legis lature of 1910. As a member of that committee (according to what he once told the writer in private conversation) he proposed that the governor be given the power to appoint the judges and tfiat all judges be compelled to re tire at the age of seventy. The com mittee voted down the proposition. Allen M. Fletcher was a member of the legislature of 1910, the body that recommended the changes with-j out proper provision of filling the ! vacancies in the judgeships . that would occur on December 1, 1914. At the time Allen M. Fletcher made the proposal that the governor should appoint the judges and when he "was a member of the legislature that made the imperfect proposal of a change in the constitution he was planning and hoping to be elected governor of the state in 1912 and be governor of Vermont when the va cancy in the judgeships occurred. We shall not claim here that he deliberately allowed the hiatus in the proposed changes of the consti tution to go unchallenged for the purpose . of getting at the courts of Vermont, but give the history above and will allow the reader to decide for himself who let the cat get into the meal. linquent on their dues for the year pay, the association can complete its year's work free of, debt. The matter of continuing the or ganization for another year could not be acted upon at that meeting but the statements of several practical farm ers that they would rather pay $10 a year than to see it stop indicates that a majority of the members want the work continued. Doubtless it will be necesary to increase the mem bership fee to 2 for the next year. but the testimony of several farmers that they had. saved from $6 to $20 a ton on fertilizers purchased through the association shows they can, well afford to pay the small fee required. Our impression from the meeting is that the Caledonia County Farm ers Association will be continued and that the fees will be kept so reasonable that any farmer in the county who wants to receive its ben efits will be able to be a member and profit by the assistance of a trained county agent. If it does continue the value of demonstration work will be so well shown that it can be de finitely decided whether or not it will be wise to Increase it and make it permanent. It will seem like really "visiting the legislature" to go to Montpelier and find T. C. Cheney at work at the state house. Mr. Cheney is probably as familiar with the mak ing of law as any person the gover nor could have found to serve as a revisor. The high cost of meat Is partially explained . by the secretary of agri culture who said in his annual re port that "steers raised in California by an Oregon operator have been shipped through Denver to Omaha and their beef sent to points on the Atlantic coast. Hogs raised in Illi nois and sold at Indianapolis have been slaughtered at Boston and a part of their cured bacon shipped to Los Angeles. Michigan dressed veal calves expressed to South Water street commission houses at Chicago have been returned to the identical shipping points from which they came to fill orders from local retail markets." Of course this ride for dressed meat has to be paid for by the man who eats it. It would be interesting to know where the few beef cattle sent out of Vermont are finally devoured . Caledonia County Farmers. The special meeting of the Cale donia County Farmers Association on Saturday last augurs well for the future of that organization. The members present found that about $600 must be raised to meet the ex penses of the current year and nearly all of those present voluntarily con tributed toward that sum. It seems clear that, if the 175 members de-

YOUR MONEY RZFUNDZ3, Tf it fails to tvncf t yon when iwdstrictlmsdi'-eetpd on We earnestly wish the scheme to establish an auto bus service in this village success. The great need of St. Johnsbury is a transportation service that will be cheap, regular and reasonably rapid. Electric cars demand too large an Investment to promise success but the auto service can be installed for a comparatively small sum and the machines have been so perfected that reliable ser vice may be expected. The success of the scheme will make much de sirable building territory available and help reduce the cost of housing that has been unreasonably expen sive for the past decade. If honestly and efficiently,' managed the public may expect the auto service to be a'great aid in the further develop ment of the village. Secretary of Agriculture Houston in his annual report says that any credit needs of the agricultural com munity beyond those eared for un der the federal reserve law should be cared for by a system of "co operative credit associations" fi nanced with -private funds, by means of which the combined v.. credit of farming communities could be uti lized, and by a system of land mort gage banks, likewise, privately cap italized. This is practically what the Caledonian suggested a few weeks ago instead of the state loan ing money to people beginning farm ing and it is pleased to see the idea advocated by such a high authority as the national secretary of agriculture. The house of representatives gave the knockout blow to the proposi tion to have $250,000,000 currency deposited in cotton and tobacco belt banks for the relief of farmers In those sections. The country will re joice in this victory for sound fi nance by the government. The Bennington Banner has just passed its twelfth ' birthday and Lieutenant-Governor F. E. Howe is still its editor.
