Financial legislation will be recommended by both the president and the secretary of the treasury. Nearly every "Republican member of congress will have from two to five bills which he will be willing to have passed in the Interest of his the- lory and constituency, and which he will derena against, an comers. With Cuba, Hawaii and finance out of the way, and no tariff bill to consider, the attention of congress will be gtven to appropriations and matters of less general Interest. Kconomy I the Order.

This Is an approximate figure arrived at by de ducting the $30,000,000 received from the Union Pacific sale from the annual de ficit. By cuttintr expenses to this line and Vising the railroad money to swell the next year's balance sheet may show a credit of some millions. The Union Pa cific sale receipts have reduced the cur rent deficit to about $32,000,000.

The pension roll Is to be shaved wme, and the 200 bills providing for public buildings will meet little encourage ment. Incidentally Corporal Tanner claims that the pension economy is al ready in effect, and that less pensions proportionately have been allowed by wlH. Clay Evans than by Cleveland's JJjienRlon commissioner. An arbitration treaty will doubtless lie negotiated with Great Britain, although little has yet been accomplished In this direction.

As before stated In these dispatches, .Senator Lodge will try to push through an immigration bill. There are two of these, one in the house and one in the senate. The house measure treats more articularlv of what are known as -f"bird3 of passage," meaning the Can- ladlans along the border who work In the United States and live and spend their money in Canada. This bill is likely to be forced into trie background by the efforts to settle the Canadian dispute by a commission, and the sen ate bill, barring illiterates and anarch- Hts from European and Asiatic coun- ries, will receive more particular at tention. The Deep Waterway Nolieinc Among other things the deep waterway project will come before congress. and an effort will be made to secure the final selection of a route. There are many other matters of less Importance hlch will engage the attention of con gress for days and weeks; but it is the general opinion that the session will be what is considered a short one. An adjournment will be taken a few days before Christmas and the recess will probably last two weeks. Little of Im portance will be done until after the holidays.

C Further dispatches say the punitive force of British troops, which met with fierce resistance on its march into the Chamkannl coun try, where thirty villages of the insur gent tribesmen were burned, has con tinued its advance and inflicted heavy punishment on the Chamkannls. These tribesmen held an almost inaccessible position, which was stormed In fine style by the Gurkhas, who captured the position at the point of the bayonet. Many of the tribesmen were killed and the bodies of thirty of the dead were left behind them. Of the British force Major Vansittart and two men were wounded and two privates killed.

Character of the Treaty Drawn t'p hy Two Aged Dlplomatlati A Fin Old EugliBhiuati Neglect of Famoua Amer ican Women. Washington, 6. Special. Con grcsfinien, as a rule, do not tako very kind ly to tho suggestion that a newgencrul ar bitration treaty with Great llritain bo rat Hied at this wssion. For somo reason or other the Idea of closing a compact with F.ngland I not popular hero. A great many of the senators who will vote to rati fy tho treaty which hns been negotiated by Secretary Sherman and .Sir Julian l'aunco fote, tho liritish embassador, uro not en thusiastic about it and would bo quite as well Mitislied if tho matter wcro dropped From sources which admit of no question as to their reliability I learn that the truo inwardness of the arbitration treaty Kchcino is as follows: Aged Diplomatic. Sir Julian l'auncefote, tho British em bassador hero, is Hearing that ago at whic h Uritish diplomatists aro usually retired. Sir Julian expects in a very short time to be placed upon tho retired list. It Is cuh tomaiy in England to givo to thoso diplo matists who have specially distinguished themselves in tho service upon their retire ment a place in tho pecrago. It is this that Sir Julian is striving for. Up to this timo his career here, while one of usefulness and dignity, has not been marked by uny special success. Tho Venezuelan affair, of which ho knew next to nothing heforo the thing was sprung upon Lord Salisbury, certainly could not bo counted among Sir Julian's triumphs. Nothing else that has fallen under his hand during his long so journ here has given him the eclat which would entitle him to a place among the peers. It is obvious that if the embassador is to secure tho coveted honor he must stir him self about and do something in order to earn it. Now, it happens that in England, us hero, a largo class of the iteoplo, the church attendants, tho business men, the peaco lovers and tho conservative folk pen orally, uro anxious to have a general treaty of arbitration with tho Lnited States They believe it would be tho harbinger of eternal peace between the two great Eng lish speaking nations. Nor does it matter much to them what kind of a treaty it is, It may not bo worth tho pacr it Is writ ten on as an actual preventive of serious disputes. It is all the same to most of them. If It a treaty of arbitration, that is enough. Therefore they would be quite well satislled with tho thin and ineffective treaty which hus Imh-ii drawn up by tho two aged diplomatists, Secretary Sherman and Sir Julian Paunccfote, and if Air Fauncefotn ran get tills little treaty through he will hat earned his peerage, and will doubtless be the happiest man in tho realm. A Flue Old Man. Aslorgns t bo United States has not h ing to loso by the making of such n treaty every ono in Washington that knows Sir Julian is hoping he will havo his heart's wish. There never was a more lovable old man. In appearance ho Is n typical Englishman of mature years. Ho looks hearty and bluff and as if ho could be sav age on occasion. As a matter of fact, he Is us soft and peaceful as a cooing dove, He is popular with all classes. His serv ants love him quito as much as his secro taries and his daughters. The ladies all vote him "the sweetest old man in the world." Ho is without doubt the best liked member of tho diplomatic corps, ol which ho is the dean and loader. Sir Julian's popularity hero is something like that which our lato embassador to Ijomlon, Mr. llayard, enjoyed over there While I was in Ixmdon last summer they told mo tho average Britisher looked upon Mr. Bayard us quito the greatest man that ever came out of America. Tho secret of his popularity was not hard to llnd. lie bad fine, winning manners, to start with Ho was benevolent of aspect and of speech, but this was not his strong card. HIb piece de resistance was his ability to make a public address upon any and every occa sion without notlco and without prepara tion. In England public speaking is al most a lost art that is, after dinner talk Ing. Of course tho political und parlta mcntary orators uro somewhat like t licit brethren on this 6ide the water, but the man who can get up and rattle off n good talk on a moment's notico Is a rarity in London and a jewel of great price. Charmed With Hayard. This Mr. Bayard was ablo to do to tiic queen's tasto and also to that of all her subjects. Tho words would roll out of his mouth in long, beautiful sentences. He could say such sweet thingsaudsuch witty tilings without apparent effort. Tho Eng lish were simply charmed with him. IK' Fliono ull the more brilliantly by contrast for tho average Englishman who essays an after dinner speech hems and haws and says "don't you know" and falls over himself and soughs whllo ho is trying t think of what to say v.r::t, and his whole l-crforinaiu-c is one of pain for himself ami also for his auditors.

Sir Kdwin Arnold, who legalized his union with a fascinating Japanese widow by an hngllsh marriage service in London, , was always c.osmoj)olitan in his ideas. Surely no Knglishman Isjrn and bred has ever sucecedeel in merging his own indi viduality into that of other iKH)plo's as tho author of "The Light of Asia" and "The Light of the World" lias done. When ho was in India in his young days, his work frhowed his inteusu sympathy with the Uuddhists. and in the preface to "The Light of Aia he wrote. "This book was written by o-ie who loved India ami tho Indian jM'ople For twrifcore of years he was English to the core of his heart in the editorials lie wrote lor the London Teh-graph, und in 18W lie came to America seemed quite ablo to unil-'i - iund us as few of his e-oun- trymen ''oit! 1 ln and then lie went on to Japan and i.iinud':.tcly bean to live a la Japonais lie lived in a native house left his shoes at his door, slept on a thick quilt, and. they say ate in true Japanese style In his bedroom he had a cheap Kitropcan washstand two Japanese chests of draw crs of wh;t;'vood ami black Ironwork and the usua'. s'.idnu cupboards, into which Ins heel was put when It was rolled up in the daytime The walls of the room were of tissue jmi pcr panels, powdered with silver maple leaves, and a clear glass belt ran around the room "at a height inconducive to pro priety." us our eoirispouileiit of tho day remarked.

I date my success exactly from tho timo I hit upon a little idea that being a novelty Immediately won for mo a reputation Am I French?

I jumjied up, soizod a candle und mado for the cellar Arrived there, I grasped a hatchet and knocked off a barrel hoop. Dividing the hoop in half, I hurried back up stairs with my embryonic waist holder. It did not take me long to cover tho curved stick with 601110 pieces of material left from tho gown and attach a ribbon und bow. It mado a very dainty ami useful nccoinpani tnent to tho gown, and my customer was delighted. Wasn't it a happy idea? Why, I never send a gown home now without a pretty waist holder to match, and I put sachet jwwdcr In tho hangers to Increase their attractiveness.
