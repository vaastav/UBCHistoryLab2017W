Hl wrote it himself. There is no doubt o! that. Thk IVeyideut is on tho right road, and the people will bo glad to keep him compauy. . Two cent po8tage~th'e President recomnemis its, the country can afford it, and the people want it. Tub country does not want silver dollars, bill the law orders their coinage and tl/G mint* must do It. But Cougrets can change , the law. ^ Oi'it llag on the seas floats bravely in the message?as it should?but it doesn't strike terior to many hearts on the bosom ol the ilt*p blue sea. Dots uuy dear Democrat think be could, If he had tt very delicate crowbar, pick u daw in the President's civil service reform ami no i>oIiticaI accessment planks? Last year the freemen of this country paid more than two millions and a quarter to maintain the Delaware match monopoly. Next year we should not pay anything. It is to be hoped that Congress will take prompt and wise action on the propositions of reform which the President huH had the wisdom and the courage to lay before it. Two hundred and two Representatives out of two hundred and ninety-three, on the lirst day. Many gentlemen are not so anxious to get to work as they are to get j their certificates of election. Tut: friends and neighbors of the late Congressman Updegrafl' and his associates in the House ol Jtepresentatives who knew his public worth, have paid a tender and j lilting tribute to his memory. i Tiiosk Congressmen who went it strong on rivers and harbors will doubtless bo glad to know that the "deestricks" will not see very much of it. The bulk o{ that gigantic baui will remain in the Treasury as a sort of nucleus for a new conscience fund. Tu e Hoard of County Commissioners very wisely holds buck $1,250 which the county does not owe, and should not pay; Now ; that Commissioners have time to think there is but little reason to fear that they will pay out the people's mohey in so freoliauded a way. The county keptjfaith with the Turnpike Company, arnf that completed the transaction. Fon the fiscal year 1882, the balance of trade in our favor was $25,902,083, but ten per cent of the previous year's excess of exports over imports, and less than fer'any year since 1870 inclusive. There was an iucrease of $50,000,000 in the imports of india-rubber, breadstufls, cotton manufactures, fruits, steel ingots, potatoes, silk manufactures, sugar' and molasses, and wool manufactures. It mav bo taken for eranted that nt its : meeting to-night Council will again con- 1 Hitler the election of a Chief of tho Fire Department. Thia officer is charged with . an important duty which comes homo to every man, woman and child in this city. ^ lie ought not to be injected as un issue into the coming municipal election. "Unless some better reason than any yet advanced * can be shown, the present Council ought to discharge its duty under tho present law. J llie i'rcHHleut'* JHchk?kc.* I The President gives to Congress and the ] country a well prepared balance sheet < showing the public business for a year, and ( to this he adds certain recommendations for the more successful management of the ; vast concern in which there are over fifty j millions of stockholders. i The statements of fact are clear, concise, i easily understood. The recomnferidatioUB i are in the main well conceived and logical; \ they will meet with popular approval, not < only because they look to the general wel- l fare but because they give high official j utterance to thoughts which at this time are uppermost in men's minds. For example, there ha3 been a general i and distinctly spoken demaud .for a judi- i cioua revision of the tariff; a considerable reduction of internal taxes; a lower rate of i letter postage; a revival of American ship- t ping; some serious effort to build a navy; ( legislation which shall, if possible, put an end to log-rolling to draw money out i of tho Treasury for wasteful purposes; pro- hibition of political assessments, and radical ; reform of the civil service. ' j The President shows practical wisdom by ' the business like way in which ho deals i with these business questions; and heshows 1 a commendable concern for the popular Will by consulting its pleasure. It will bo | observed that on political assessments and { civil service reform?with respect to ] which questions the people are very much in earnest?the President takes high < ground and intrenches himself behind solid, incontrovertible argument.. Secure and Btable tenure of subordinate employes, no political assessments?this is good' doctrine and the people will applaud it. The message id strong in all the elements ( which- give strength to State papers- of its character?dignity, wise conception, courage of conviction, manly independence, ! plain evory-day English which anybody who can read can understand. It will give strength to the Republican organization, ! and, if the suggestions be acted upon in a prompt and liberal spirit, will bo productive of lasting benefits to the country. ; uoenn iMwvaier*.

TAIUFF MATTEKS. ' His message on tbo tariff is criticised by 1 ,he tariff men as is,the tariff commission, who aro chargcd with having sacrificed the ; jeneral industries to propiato the free trad- ( jre on the commission. "Sunset"Cox ! jpened the ball for the free ships by trying :o get a bill before a special committee on he decline of American shipping but the , Souse under the lead of "Ward sat down : >n him* and sent it.to the committee on ' :ommerce. 1 The President for Uin first timn in munv rears makes no estimates for the river and harbor improvements, and the committee consequently have nothing on which to irameabill. JTlicy are to meet on Friday to decide upon their course of action, but , is the President reports seventeen millions ! )f dollars unexpended from the previous 1 jill, it is not unlikely that no bill will be ; passed at this session.

"Washington, Dec. 4.?In consequence af the unrescimied order of lost session, Ixlng 11 a. as the hour of the assembling dI tho House, second session, that body to- i ilay was opened by th(j speaker at that hour. The galleries were comfortably filled. On the floor u.hnRt.1inv thrnni* nf members engaged in friendly greeting and in exchanging jocular remarks in reference to the recent elections. The appearance of the chamber was not changed, the samo dingy carpet covering the floor, though the rovarnishing of the desks tends to make the hall look brighter. After reference to the death of Representatives Updcgr&fF and Lowe by the chaplain in tne opening prayer, the clerk proceeded to call the roll. Tho roll call discovered that there were present two hundred and two members, i The following members were then sworn in , as members of the Mouse to fill vacancies; llitt, of Illinois, to succeed Hawk; llees, of Georgia, to succeed Stephens; Shelby, of Alabama, to succeed himself. Calkins, of Indiana, presented a memorial against tho swearing iu of Shelby, but asked for no action beyond reference to the Committee of Election, and it was so ordered. Monlton, Illinois, presented a petition from John P. Cline, claiming to be elected as a delegate from Utah. A resolution-was adopted providing for the appointment of committees to inform the President ai}d senate that the House was ready to proceed to business. The Speaker presented the report of the Tariff Commission, which, on, motion of Mr. Kelley, waa referred to the Ways and Means committee. A colloquy ensued between Kelley and Cox, during which the latter remarked sarcastically that he waa happy .to hear the Secretary of the Commission was about to leave for Eu* rope. After some routino business. Mr. Iterbert, of Alabama, announced tlio death of Mr. Lowe, and Mr. Taylor, of Ohio, announced the death of l)r. Updegraff, and the I louse outof respect to the memory of tho deceased at 11:10 p. m. adjourned. The Senate was'called to order at noon by President pro tem Davis.

Tho President's messago was then communicated, which was read by the Clerk*. At the conclusion of the reading of the message, tho President pro km submitted the annual renorts of the Secretary of tho Treasury and Attorney General, alter which Mr. Brown, of Georuia, announced the death of Heuator Hill and offered a resolution of regret, which was unanimously agreed to.

Butler, the well known founder of the Woman's I*abor Exchange, went to the room in which the ofllcers were and requested possession of various articles, which she says she .had been promised. The application was refused and ascene ensued. Mrs. Butler left the Capitol in a state of indignation, declaring she had been grossly insulted and employed an attorney to attend to the matter in the courts. TilOjtnilUClfO IllVMf IitmIIj... "Washington, December 4.?In the Jeannette Court this morning, Ninderman continued his testimony. The Judge Advocate says tlio letter, found on the body of Collins has not been rejected by the Court lis requested. The question whether the letter will be received as evidence has not yet been decided. Ninderman described the arrival and Burial of Ericlcson. During the narrative* ho was much affected. He said they carried the body, wrapped in a Hag, to the river, cut a hole in the ice and put the corpse therein, and thai, the tide carried the body under the ice. 

CAPITAL BRIEFS. Clayton Macinichael, tlio new United States Marshal of the District of Columbia, :ook the oath and possession of the ofiice yesterday morning. The House committee to-day further re lupfljl tlm Tn/llnn TTfrt ? muuu Dili, making the total amount $5,208,955, a decrease if $274,200 from tho appropriation of the :urrent year. Kosson says in an interview in National Republican if Blaine's criticisms has been correctly reported lie, (Blaine), lias never icon either the Nicaragauan canal hill or the Commissioner's report. The Republican members of the Senate, in caucus, decided to continuo the commissions as constituded, the vacancy on the commissions by the death of Senator Hill to be tilled by a Democratic Senator. The star route trial came up in the Criminal Court yesterday morning, and on account of excusing several members of the panel the Court adjourned until to-morrow, tt was reported by one of the counsel that ax-senator Dorsev was seriously ill. Owing to land frauds of a startling uingnitudo in connection with the Osaefil [ndian lands, the Kansas Commissioner of the General land Office issued an order suspending all cash entries made by single men since Juno 23, 1881, where the lands lie within the counties of Sunmer, Harper, Kings and Comanche. In an interview in today's Washington Post, Mr. Blaine expresses himself as opposed to the Kusson bill and report, which propose to appropriate $75,000,000 for the construction of an inter-oceanic canal in Nicaragua. lie thinks the United States should not build a canal which it' could not control under the provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. Tragic Sccno In Court. Chicago, December4.?Quite a dramatic and startling scene occurred in the Stiles murder case to-day. The defendant went on the stand not long alter the opening of court, and began tho Btory oMier rolationB with the man she at last killed. It was a lengand uncomfortable recital of abuse at the hands of the dead man, and occupied nearly live hours in telling. -She approached the date of the tragedy, Ion# and wearisome, and the strain and recollections recalled overcame her calm demeanor, and Bhe began to grow nervous and incoherent when she came to the description of the walk into the city through the rain from Sunnysido on the night of -the murder. She suddenly threw up her Lands and fell from the witness' chair in hysterical convulsions, which required half a dozen strong me(i to restrain her.. With her 3hrieks ringing through the room, she was removed and the court adjourned. Physicians think she will be able to complete her story to-morrow. iMtfaburKti A ConncllNVllIe Rnilronil Meeting.

To the Sa\utc and Jloiue of lleprcscntdtlm of I the United States: It is provided by the Constitution that the President ahull from time to time give to the Congress Information of the statu of the-Union and recommend to their consideration such measures ns he shall judge necessary and expedient. In viewing the events of tlio year, which havo elapsed since the commencement of your session, 1 first call your attention to the gratifying condition of our foreign affairs. Our intur. course with other powers has continued to bo of tlio most friendly character. Such slight differences ns have arisen during the year have been already settled, or are likely to reach an early adjustment. 

AUUKSTS OK AMR1UCAK CITIZEN'S. The arrest of citizens of the United States in Ireland under thy recent laws, ^vbich owe their origin to the condition of tliat country, has led to a somewhat extended correspondence with tho Government of Great Britain. A disposition to respect our rights lias boon practically manifested by tho release of the arrested parties. The claim of this Nation in regard to the supervision and control of any inter-oceanic canal across tho American isthmus has continued to bo the subject of conference. It is likely that time will bo more , powerful than discussion iu removing the divergence betwepn tliftt.wnwnMnna -u>i>r>c? feelings is bo closely connected by the intimacy of their relation and the community of their interests. Our long-established friendliness -with Russia has remained unbroken. It has prompted me to proffer the earnest counsels of this Government that measures be adopted for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew race in that conntry has lately suffered. It has not transpired that any American citizen lias been subjected to arrest or injury, but our courteous remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There is reason to believe that the time is not far distant whoa llussia will be able to secure toleration to all faiths within her borders. MATTERS OF INTEKNATION*AL INTEREST. At au'international convention held at Paris, in 1880, an agreement was reached in a report tor the protection of trade marks, patented articles and the right of manufacturing firms and corporations. The formulating into treaties of the recommeudatioiiB thus adopted is receivhii? tho niton. tion which it merits. The. protection of submarine cables is a subject now* under consideration by an international conference at Taris. Believing that it is clearly the true policy of this Government to favor the neutralization of this means of intercourse, I requested our minister to France to attend the Convention as a delegate. I also designated two of our eminent Scientists to attend as our representatives at the meeting of an International Committee at Paris for considering the adoption of a common unit lo measure electric force. In view of the frequent occurrence of conferences for the consideration ot important matters of common interest to civilized nations, I respectfully suggest that the Executive be invested by Cong-, ress with discretionary power to send delegates to such conventions, and that provisions be made lo defray expenses incident thereto. The difference between the United States and Spain as to the effect of a judgment anu ceruucnte 01 naturalization hfts not yat been adjusted, but it is hoped and believed that the negotiations now in progress will result in the establishment of , the position which seems to this government so reasonable and just. UXIIOIIVITAXV KB?1 IMPOSED OS -UIKKICA.V VESSELS. I have already called1 the attention of Congress to thcjact that in parts of Spain and its colonies, onerons lines have lately been imposed on vessels of the United States for trivial technical offences against local regulations. ElTorts for the abatement ot these exactions have thus far proved unsuccessful. I regret to inform yon also that the fees demanded by .the Spanish Consuls in American ports are in some cases so large, when compared with the value of the cargo, as to amount, in effect, to a considerable export duty, and : that our remonstrances in this regard have not as yet received the attention which thev Rfttitn to iIphpwp The German government has invited the United States to participate in an international exhibition of domestic cattle to be held at Hamburg in July, 1883. If 1 tins country is to bo represented it is im- 1 portant that in the early days of this sea- 1 sion Congress should make "a suitable ap- ' propriation for that purpose. The death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that government expressions of profound respect for his exalted charac- i ter and for liis honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country. The Italian government has raised a question as to the propriety of recognizing in his < diial capacity the representative of this country reconflv jiiwnvlito/1 hn?l. ?io onn-n. . tary of legation and consul general at Rome. t He has been relieved aa secretary, but his i exequatur aa consul general lias thus far 1 been withheld. i KXT11AMTIOK TIlEATlKS. ' The oxtradition convention with Belgium which has been in operation since 1S74 has been lately supplanted.by another. Tho Senate has signified its approval and ratifications have been duly exchanged between : the contracting countries. To Uie list of extraditable crimes 1ms been added that of the attempted assassination of tho chief of the State. Negotiations have beon opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizens > can renounce their allegiance and become ; citizens ot the UnitedStates without obtaining tho consent of tho Swiss government. | I am glad to inform you that tho emtnigra- i tion of paupers and criminals from certain of the cantons of Switzerland . has substantially closed and is no ( longer sanctioned by the authorities. The consideration of this subject prompts , thq suggestion that the act of August Sd, 1882, which has for its object tho return of 1 joreigu convicts to weir own country should be so modified as not to be open to the interpretation that it nffecto the extradition of criminals on preferred charges ol i crime. Tho Ottoman porte has. not yet assented to tho interpretation whiclrtbia Government haB put upon the treaty ol 1S30, relative to its jurisdictional rights in Turkey. It may well be. howover, that this difference will bo adjusted by a general revision ol tho system ol jurisdiction ot tho United States in tho countries of tho east, a subject to which your attention has been already called by tbo Secretary olStato. In tho interest ot justice towards Chili and Japan I trust that tho question of tho return of thoindemnity fund to- tho trovernments of these countries will reacll at tho present session tho satisfactory solution which I have already recommended, and nuiuu nw ii\suu? uuuu jurcsuiuiowca DV Congressional discussion.

' ^ The Dally News says: It seems that a fresident- Arthur litis taken to hoart the ~2\ lesson of the late elections. Tlie passage \{ in his message pronouncing in favor of 0 civil service reform must be intended as an oiler at reconciliation to disaffected Kepublicans. Deferring to the financial part of the message, the JYciw says, if a reduc- " tion'of the national dobt proceeds at last ? year's rate, the protective tarill" must fall to " the ground, because there will be no means n of expending tiio enormous surplus. ^ muc.Vcngli DciiIcn the Pulitzer Ntory. 81 Philadelphia, December 4.?Mr. Wayne ^ MacVeagh, when shown the statement of |J Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, of the St. Louis i'ort u Dispatch, published to-day, said that 'Mr. Pulitzer had undoubtedly been imposed " upon, as many others had been, with J reference to alleged incidents of what is ft alleged to be the secret history of the star u route cases.

TIIE CIIUKCII. After tlie stricken relatives bad taken iave of their dead, the body -was borne to |j io old Friends' Meeting Ilouse, preceded y the Congressional escort and tho iourners. At the door the cscort parted, ) make way for the collin and Jamily. j he members of the committee wore white \] ishes with black and white rosettes. he casket wsis placed in the open e Dace at the left of the ministers' p and, and the mourners took seats to the j sft and rear of the ministers. 1] The vastedilice was filled to overflow* ? lg. The house is an unusually largo one, {> ad has an . interesting history. 'It was uilt in 1S13, and will hold 2,50C people. a capiiunv yeatcruay wHH UixeU lO U16 Utlost. It is a building of peculiar arclii:cture{ being 90 feet loop and. GO wide, ad being divided in the middle by a Seconal partition, all but the lower part of inch was removed yesterday. Abovo is bi deep gallery running around, the entire 0 ouse. Attention was paid to scouring the . tmost capacity, aiid not to style, in its u instruction. u It was with some dilliculty that Buf- jt cient room was, kept open in the aisles ?allow passage through them, many being r nablo to obtain seats. The congregation ^ us made up of people of till denomiua- 11 one, colore and ages,;tbo large number fcJ t colored peoplo being particularly no- 1 ceable. To these, before and since the P lot of Blavery was wiped from the nation- 11 escutcheon, Dr. UpdegralT had] been a lend in need, and they now came to pay ieir hist tribute to his memory. THE SERVICES. ?I Rev. A. II. Hussoy, editor of' the Gotpcl t( 'jcposilor, ol Columbus, and ? 'minister of leSociety^ of Friends, had charge of the ^i irvicea. fie opened with an appropriate si jripture reading, and the vast assemblage r< ecame as. still as death. Attheconclu- o' on of the reading ho announced tho j'4 ymn: 13 "J(i the Christian's home fn glory Hi There remains a laud of rest, sj Tliere ray Sftvlor'h gono before rac To fulfill ray soul's request. P Tlicro Is rest for tlio weary." T This was sweetly and impressively sung qi yr a choir of sixty young ladies, and dur- b ig the singing many of those present gavo mtto tears. Rev. Dr. Douglian Clark, of Richmond. idiana; after a feeling prayer, preached le funeral sermon, taking lor his text tho verse of the fifth chapter of Second orinthians: "For we know that if our trthly house of this tabernacle he jells lived, wejliave a building of God, a house 8C Dt made with hands, eternal in the uavens." so The discourse was a striking exposition fo ! the speaker's ideas of immortality. He 1 iid man cannot get rid of his personal n? entity. The object we see before us is jr at our friend himself, but his remains. ti\ Hint an apt word. These are his remains, ir ho himself, the part of him which ho illed "I" when, ho was among men,has ? spurted. Tbo body ia like a tenement V, iat has been moved out of. "When iencls movo away from their home, it is td to see the empty house, but by and by m e geta letter from them, Baying they still 01 ve and are happy elsewhere. So it is -w hen a spirit moves'out of its tenement to P' that bourne from?which * no traveler re- st irns," anil in this case we had the blessed ? jsurance that our dear brother has , nly become absent from the body to bo tl resent with the Lord. The speaker went rt n to depict the laullering and tl ain, the doubt and trial and labor u hicli end in deatb.' -When ambitious K eople accomplished their aims ho won- U ereU if they were satisfied. Isk it not like rt Ihrist said to the woman of Samaria, jr They that drink of this water shall thirst U Rain'," God has made us lor hlmseU a nuJ the soul in restless till' It rests ill Win. lie closed with a forcible exhortation to the unrepentant to turn from their evil wnvfl to Uoil. The brief sermon won delivered for the moil part in u conversational tone, but at times Dr. Clark roBo to I in passioned eloquence, and throughout bohl his hearers spellbound, nuil curried them with him through his clear, logical consideration of thu condition of tho soul after death. Another hymn was sung, and In response to nn Invitation to friends to tunko any remarks tliey might deslro to oll'er, Dr. A. 1[. Read, President of tho Steuben villo Female Seminary, pronounced a slowlug eulogv, speaking of Dr. Updegm/r iw a /rionil, ns a neighbor, as n scholar and a man of literary culture. It was so feelingly dellv ored tliat Bobs wore heard Id various parts )f tlie nouBc. ' TUB

All opportunity wan thou extended to riends of the deceased to view tho remains, ind, after souio trouble in arranging the leople bo that nil could pass the caskct, the unernl cortege took' up its march for the JpdegrafT family burial ground, which is ibout three-quarters of a mile from the necting houaq. So great was tho number of vehicles and persons that all had not left tho churcli vhen the head 0/ the profession reached ho grave. The casket bearing tho romains vnaborne in a plain hearse, the pall hear. :rs, mourners and escort following in car iageti, followed in their turn by private images, buggies and wagons, horses and oot passengers. At the grave Colonel T. J). Coulter, ol iteubenvillo, made souks brief remarks, laying that he felt that lie would be false 0 the feelings of his heart if he'did not unbrace tho opportunity to pay a final ribute to tho memory of hi? dead friend.

Tho coflin was then lowered into tlie ;rave, ft beautiful wreathe of white flowers md a floral cross, sent by Speaker .Keifer s ft token of his esteem lor tho departed, eating upon it. It was Blowly that the friends of the lost mo dispersed; and with fresli tears as the} ealized with new. force that they would lever again see his kindly faco or hear his riendly voico on earth. Probably hover before in the history of ifount Pleasant did she suitor tho loss o'f a :itizen whose death caused such general orrow. Certainly not for years luisn dentil 11 tlielConirressional district caused such vide spread and profound regret. The ributeof his fellow men, spontaneous and >eauti/ul aa it was, witnessed yesterday, vas a memorable endorsement of his faith* illness as a friend, his honor as a man and lis integrity as a Representative.
