To think she once held my .life, as it were, in her little -hand, and I can't recollect, to save my son! what her name was. - Anyhow, whoever she was, she had proved false to me, and, as I was very young Bt the time, I had promptly come to the resolution to destroy my self. My first intention was to go and blow my brains all over the stair-car pet, but then I reflected that everyone would know that Henrietta come to think of it, her name was Henrietta had infatuated me and turned my head 'No,' said I to myself, ' no scandal, no publicity V Let me Imitate the wound ed stag, which, seeking to hide its fata hurt, betakes himself to the most se crct thickets, there to perish far from all human eyes. II. In this elegiac disposition I took the 30 train "to Melon,'', which set me down jost at dusk within a few steps of the Golden Lion, s very well-kept inn with clean beds and a capital table.

With the precious bit of bemp in my p'ockeV I took my way toward a tbioket not.far from tbe hotel in a lit tie wood whose paths were familiar to me. Th'ere was one lonely and gloomy copse there where I knew my lifeless body would "swing for weeka ere it was discovered. . . III. Updo the road I thought of Bertha I was wrong before ; come to think of it it was Bertha and enrsed . her with all the bitterness ofjwhich my onl was capable. I then tested my cord. It was not snch an agent of self-destrnctlon as I would have chos en haa X naa an assortment from which to make a selection. It seemed to me both short and not op to the weight. I was annoyed. Too cannot tell bow a trifle like that will affect a person's temper at each a moment. A farther disappointment was In store for me. On arriving at the spot had selected in advance I was disa greeably surprised to find somebody else there. An individual whose back only 1 could see was occupied in fas tening a rope to the most eligible branch of my tree. ' Hello I What are you doing there ?' cried. lie turned round. ' What business is that of yours, anyway V he said. 'Bab; don't you think I know what you intend doing? Well, and supposing I wanted to hang myself It is my own funeral suicide, I mean.' IV. I regarded him narrowly, lie was handsome and manly young fellow of about my own age, with a frank and winning countenance. He was deadly pale. This yonng man,' said I lifting my hands to heaven, ' was going to take his life his own precious life all for IIia uka nt a wnrthlaaa tilt' 'Sir I' be cried. Poor, silly fool,' I went on, com muning with myself alood, 'he wonld undertake to defend her. All lovers are the same. Will you, 'I continued take my advice the advice of a well wisher? Jost leaye that cord there (it was a stouter rope than mine, I bad observed) and go quietly home, like a good fellow. When you are yourself yon will thank 'me for giving you such good advice. lie shook his head gloomily. ' I de- sire to die,' he muttered. ' Don't let yourself be goaded ; into aking a step that, if you were alive you would regret to-morrow,' I went on, with a benevolent persistence (Yon see, the fellow had pre-empted the only really eligible bough in tbe wood). When you are dead it will be too late to chauge your mind. ' You speak to me without knowing wbat misfortune has happened to me. I can guess it. ; No, you can not guess it. ; Sir, a woman that I loved ; a woman for whom' And be went on to tell me his story which, singularly enough, was pre cisely like mine. The coincidence made me pause a moment to collect my thoughts. ' ! ' V. ' I see said Charles (he had told me in tbe course of his painful story that his name was Charles) ' that your si lence jsstifiea rae,' 'By no means,' I cried. (You Will observe that it wouldn't haye been dignified for me to abandon at once my former position on the subject of suicide.) ' There Is nothing whatever ia ii that yoa have told mo to justify you in taking your life. Come, my friend, said I, becoming really inter ested in his case, 'come, let us reason the matter out 'Why should you com plain because you have been unfortu nate in love ? Don't you know wbat the poet says ? Tbe lot of girls was to deceive Since winter first was snowy. ' Women have been false to thei lovers from all time ; women will be false to their lovers to all time.' ' But no woman has ever been a false to her lover as this woman was to me.' ' Lots of 'em have.' 'No; none could be.' ' But I tell you thousands of 'em have. I know one whose conduct towards an intimate friend of mine o Why should you kill your self because one pretty woman has played you false ? Seek another one a prettier one. 'In vain, in vain,' he groaned ; 'she was the only woman in the world ever cared for tbe handsomest wo man in all Paris, sir.' O, bosh. I know a hundred hand somer and more tender, than she ever could be. You may think in the first moments of eorene89 that there are no other women in tbe world, but in i month from now you will be pre pared to admit how Billy it was to en. tertain such a thought.' VI. My eloquence seemed so convincing and my position so sound that it was a pleasure to me to listen to myself. went on : Wbat good will it do you to hang yourself? Tell me, if you can, what useful purpose will be subserved. Ei ther the woman has a heart or she has net. If she has no heart ' 'She has none none.'' ' Of course she has none. Therefore your death will only be agreeable to her will only flatter her. It is a big advertisement tor a woman to have man kill himself on her account. What will the public say the boys? They'll say. 'Charles-was an ass a silly ass.' Yes, Charles, everybody will say you were a silly ass, and everybody will be right in saying bo.' 1 - 'I waxed eloqnentjnh point of fact, for some moments it had octnred to me that I was arguing' my 'own case, pleading for my own 'life!'' I( heaped fact Upon fact, added argument to ar gument, with -such earnestness and closeness of reasoning that my friend Charles at last fell 1 into my arms and cried, ' You are right, you are right bid me do whatever you would and I will obey you. ' All right,' said I, 'let ns go and get some breakfast.' - VII.- r I brought him back to the Golden Lion. I was terribly hunzry. The table at which, we seated our selves was neatly set, and aided one's appetite by its snowy linen, its glitter ing glassware, its golden brown loaves and its yellow butter. When a thick and juicy steak with potatoes naa - oeen served up to ns, lapping our prisoned nostrils in the elysium of its appetising odors and staining our knives in its vermeil es sence, and we had tasted the first glass of some remarkably particular Bor deaux, we were rapturously silent, but our speaking eyes said nay, shouted ; ' Well, life isn't such a bad thing, after all.' 'If I hadn't met you,' said Charles, reaching across the table to squeeze my hand. 'If I hadn't met him,' I thought, as returned his cordial grsap. 'It was the most remarkable piece of luck I ever heard of,' he continued ; I don't suppose that a human being goes through that cepse . twice a month. I remained discreetly silent. 'But, I say, you know,' he went on as if a sudden light had flashed upon him, ' what were .you doing in that lonely part of the wood at that early hour of the morning? I could not help blushing guiltily. You were going' to hang yourself, too. I was upon the very same tree. Here is the rope I had in my pocket. ' The best joke I ever heard of,' said Charles, as we clinked our glasses. Adapted from the French. NATUUAL BAGPIPES. Yesterday morning a Constitution reporter, observing quite a crowd around a negro boy in the car-shed, approached and inquired the cause oi the excitement. lie . discovered that tbe boy was a musical prodigy on a very unique scale. By placing his right hand over his,righ$ earjmd par tially opening his mouth this boy gave the exact Imitation ot the music al tones of the Scottish bagpiper,play ing many airs with remarkable accu racy. The music seemed to come from the inside of the boy's head, and many people were - attracted to the spot, thinking that the bagpipes were giv ing forth their rich, mild melody. The boy was very accommdating, : and played many airs, gliding with ease from the gay to the grave. For in stance, he played Dixie with great spirit and rapidity, and then in the slowest and most mournful cadence gave ' Streams of Mercy Never Ceas ing.' His name is Alonzo Barnes, and he bails from Eastman. lie is only 18 years of age, and says that he found out by accident about three years ago that his head was full of bagpipes, and has been practicing upon them ever Bince. He said that he could play any tune that was whistled ; whereupon some one in tbe crowd suggested that he give something from Pinatore. He bad never heard of the piece, he said, but called upon man after man in the group to whistle for him, but sot one in tbe crowd seemed equal to the task. All admitted that they had once heard it, but so long ago that it was difficult to recall. Tbe boy holds nothing whatever in his mouth, but simply places his right hand over his right ear and without the slightest efiort starts his bagpipes, Atlanta (Ga.) Constitution. THE LIST DITCH. Fred Grover sat in bis attic up town ., A. few short months before, Fred had left his home in Massachusetts to study medicine in New York. His father had given his son some good advice, and (what Fred thought a great deal more valuable) five hundred dol lars to Dav his hotel bills and other expenses. His mother had given him a new set of shirts, some flannel jack etH, a fifty dollar bill which she had saved from her housekeeping expen ses made him promise to be a good boy which Fred very readily did, for he intended to be if he could and ofl he started. When Fred arrived in New York he set to work manfully, having deter mined to rival Mott or Carnechan in a very short time or igoominously re tire from the profession New York is very seductive, and I am sorry to say it Fred Grover was very fond of pleasure. Consequently he soon became an accomplished play er at billiards, and quickly discovered tbe houses where the best dinners could be obtained. When yonng men indulge too freely in good dinners, cigars, etc, they ob serve with surprise how rapidly their money disappears, it was so wun Fred, for having occasion one day to draw twenty dollars out of the bank, where he had deposited, his money, he was somewhat disconcerted by be ing told that there was only two dol lars and some odd cents to his credit. Fred went home feeling pretty badly. What to do he did not know. Having been in New York only three months and spending five hundred and fifty dollar8,he couldn't write home for more no, that was impossible, so he made up his mind to attend lectures regu larly and study tremendously hard. Poor Fred I So things went on for four or five weeks. Fred had visited a pawnbrok er several times, and left that gentle man, who so kindly lends money to those who are in want of it, bis watch, a dozen shirts, one or two coats, and several pairs of pantaloons. , Fred's landlady bad received no money for some time, so she began to importune him tor payment, and hint ed mildly tmttifsome was not forth coming very shortly Fred would have to find a new boarding-house Well, as I said before, Fred Grover sat in his attic, pondering oyer his ill- luck as. he called, it, but correctly speaking, over his improvidence and deploring the honr that brought him to New York. How .seldom we think of blaming our own imprudence I We generally manage to find an excuse for our little weaknesses. ' It,' mused Fred, 'I were to write to mother. I know she'd send on the money; but i can't do tnat no, in starve first. I wonder if come in 1" The last two words were shouted in a tone much louder than there was any occasion for, bnt Fred had been inter rupted by a tap at the door, and it had somewhat startled him. The doorslowly opened andin stalk ed a matronly-looking woman, with rather a red face, and who had three curls on each side of her face. Fred turned all manner of colors. Mr. Grover,' said the lady, ' wonld you let me have some money, if you please ?' I haven't any to day, Mrs. Jackson, but, but 'But wbat, sir?' and the matronly looking woman frowned 1 at poor Fred. 'I was going to say I expect a re mittance from home in a day or two and then III give you some.' Mrs. Jackson's face twitched about all manner of ways; finally she said : If you cannot let me have some monev to-morrow, Mr. Grover, I shall feel obliged to you if you will get an other boarding-house.' Fred readily promised to let her have some money the folio wine day, though where ho was going. to get: it from he hadn't the wildest idea. How ever it was a respite, and he shouldn't have to face Mrs. .Jackson till the fol lowing day. , When we owe money and promise to pay to-morrow, what a long way to-morrow appears. When Mrs.; Jackson had left the room Fred put his hands to the bot tom of his trousers's pocket and be gan to walk about the room with rap id strides. ' Wbat the deuee is to be done? I don't know. Let me see oh that's no use ; I've pawned everything that's pawnablel' Fred threw himself upon his bed to try and calm himself. ' He counted all the flies upon tbe ceiling, and longed to be a fly because they didn't have to pay board bills. .' By Jove, a good idea 1 said Fred, tartingup. Ill try, to. borrow it; very likely Jim can lend it to me.'' ; . He seized his hat and hurried from the house. Attached to the house that Fred had ust left is a yard, but called by. the landlady a garden ; behind that garden is a small lade leading to nowhere in particular, and having its entrance in street chiefly devoted to tenemant. houses, dirt and squalling children. About eleven o'clock' that night a man .very carefully looked ' over the fence that separated the aforesaid gar den from the above-mentioned lane. Looking carefully around, he drew from his pocket a pair of pincers, and commenced ; breaking off. short a few of the spikes that were on the top of the fence, and had been put there, I presume, for the express purpose of annoying the neighboring cats. After counting the number he had broken off, by feeling them with his hand, be carefully climbed to the top of the fence, and then lowered himself into the garden. I ; ' Blame ' the things I' he muttered, having alighted ' in tbe middle of a lilac bush, which slightly scratched him, 'there's always something to in terfere with a fellow's business.' IItviug extricated himself from the bush, be crept stealthily toward tbe yard door, applied his ear to the key- bole, and liateued. He produced an augur from one of tbe numerous pockets in his coat, and theu began to bore a hole so quietly that you could hardly hear it in tbe door. When he had finished, he put his arm through the orifice, quietly withdrew the bolt, and entered the bouse. When he was inside, by the aid of a dark lantern, he grouped hia way to the bottom of the basement staii-3 and then began ascending them, glancing with keen and penetrating eyes at ev ery object around him. On a dumb waiter near the dinins-room door a fork had been left, no doubt by the carelessness of one of the servants. His eyes rested upon it ; he went to it and examined it carefully. ' Plated V he exclaimed, in a tone of disgust, and put it down again. Quietly, and as cautiously as be fore, he ascended the next flight of stairs ; tries the handle of a door; it yields to him ; he pushes it slowly and noiselessly open ; puta in hia head, finds it only a bath-room ; he closes the door, and ascends the next flight of stairs. He hears a key being put into the lock at the hall door : he holds his breath and listens attentively. Who. ever it is closes the hall door behind him, and begins to climb the hall stairs ; he does the same. At last the top of the stairs is reach ed ; the fool8tep8 are coming nearer, and at last actually begin to ascend the last flight, at the head of which he is, lie pusnes open a door, glances hurriedly around the room, finds it is vacant, rushes to the bed and crawls underneath. ' At a late hour at night Fred Grover returned to his boarding-house, tired and disconsolate, He had been un able to raise any money, consequent Iv in the morning he would have to seek other quarters to lfve in. When he entered his room he threw himself into a chair, lighted his pipe and puffed out thick clouds of smoke, musing as he did so : ' What a fool I've been ; spent all my money, and must either beg, borrow or cheat during the next six months to liye. By Jove I I must lcaye off this spreeing. It's unfair to my fath er to spend his money in the way I have been doing Fred started up, aud placing his forehead against the window pane, looked upon the cold, dark night. ' What a shame It is that money is not more equally distributed; now that old fellow down stairs, they say, is running over with money. 1 won der if he would lend me a little if I were to ask him ? Pshaw ! tbe idea is absurd. How the deuce, 1 am to face Mrs. Jackson in the morning I don't know.' Ah catch chew I' ' What's that ? It sounded confound edly like a sneeze. Ahl' And Fred rushed to a corner of the room, seized a sword cane, drew it and looked cau tiously under the bed. The first' thing that met his gaze was the gentleman, who, a short time pre viously, had climbed oyer the 'garden fence, 'What do you want? Come out from there ?' The man came from under the bed, stood upright, and glared sullenly at Fred. Now, my good fellow, what were you doing there ?' ' What's the good of talking ? You know as well as I do what I was do ing there said the man. ' You wanted to rob the house, I suppose?' ' This ain't a police court, is it ? Take me to one it you are going to, anq then I'll tell you what I want to do, perhaps.'. 'Suppose I were to let you go, what would you do?' ' Make tracks as fast as I could.' UmphI have you any money about you ?' 'No.' ' Ah. then. I can't let you go. I must wake up the house and get a police man.' ' Hold on. I think I haye a little.' Will you lend me lome?' ' How much do you want?' 'Filty dollars, and I assure you on my word of honor I'll return it to you as soon as l get a remittance irom home.' The man offered to lend him twenty but Fred insisted upon having fifty or none at all. So, after a deal of talk- ing, the man reluctantly drew a roll of bills from his pocket, counted out fif ty dollars, and handed them to Fred, who scrutinized them carefully. UmphI, they eeem good. Now you may go, and oon i let me eaten you here again. When I'm ready to return it I'll put an advertisement in some paper to that eJect.' The man sulkily left the room, Fred politely lighted him down stairs, clos ed the hall door after him and went to bed; - - - - In the morning he settled Mrs, Jackson's claim and commenced study in good earnest. He has now one of the best practioes in New York. ... Fred put the promised advertise ment in the paper several times, but as no one came forward to claim the borrowed money, banded it over to a charitable society in that city. 'It was hardly the thing Fred thinks sometimes, 'for the robber to have been robbed. Wbat dp you think, reader? HAYES'. MESSAGE The following extracts from Hayes' Message sent to Congress on tbe 1st inst. contain all the essential points of the document: , The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs since my last annual message to Con gress are connected with tbe financial operations of the Government directly affecting the business interests of tbe country. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival of business. With a cur rency equivalent in value to the mon y oi iue commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal compe tilion with other nations in trade and production. 

DOWN WITH SILVER. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe, to effect a perma nent system for the eqnality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legis lation on the general .subject. I would however, strongly urge upon Con gress the importance of authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to sub pend the coinage of silver dollars up on the present legal ratio. The mar ket value of the silver dollar being un iformly and largely less than the mar B.CK vwue ui tne goia sonar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain tnem at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheap er coin is forced into circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon be come the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. DOWN WITH THE GREENBACKS AND TAX TEA AND COFFEE, The reti reman t from circulation of United States notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress to wards a safe and stable currency,which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government, and the in terest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender paper money, based who! ly npon tbe authority and credit of the Government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution, and a violation of sound financial principles. The issue of United Stales notes daring the late civil war, with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals. was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from immi nent peril. The circulation of these as paper money, for any protracted period of time after the accomplish ment of this purpose was not con templated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the redemption and with drawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period consistent with tbe attainment of the object for which they were provided. The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Constitu tion, has been to avoid tbe creation of a national debt, and when from neces sity, in time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as pos sible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited peri od be maintained. If any change of tbe objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has shown Bw that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars annually to the Treasury. 

FINANCIAL. - The attention of Congress ia called to the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,1879, were $273,827.18446 ; the or dinary expenditures for the same peri od $205,947,883.53; leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $6,879,300.93. The receipts for the present fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, actual and esti mated, are as follows: Actual re ceipts for the first quarter, commenc ing July 1, 1879 $79,843,663 64; esti mated receipts for the remaining three quarters of the year, $208,157,336.36; total receipts .for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000, 000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows :. For the quarter commenc ing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures, $91,683,38510; and' for the remaining three.qaarters of the year the expend itures are estimated at $172,316,1490 making the total expenditures $264, 30,000 and leaving an estimated sur plus revenue for the year ending June 30, 1SS0, of $24,000,000. The to tal receipts during the nex.t fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, estimated ac cording to existing laws, will be $283, 000,000 ; and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be $278,037,363 39 leaving a surplus of $9,902,635.61 for that year. The large amount expended for ar rears of pensions daring the last and the present fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249,60, has prevented the ap plication of the full amount required by law to tbe sinking fund for the our rent year ; but those arrears having been substantially paid, it is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained without any change in ex isting law. The Secretary of War ; reports that the War Department estimates for the fiscal year ending Jane 30, 18S1, ara $40,380,428.93, the same being for a less sum of money than, any Annual estimate rendered to Congress from that Department during a period of at least twelve years.
