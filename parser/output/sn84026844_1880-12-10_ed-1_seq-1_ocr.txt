Taere is nothing in the wool market re* porta (his week that is different from tbe newAof la*t week, aDd we therefore omit the report fiom onr columns. No change of prices are reported, though all grades of wool are reported as firm at full former quotations. The excitement that existed i in this wool region during the past week or two has eubsidtd. and matters are resting quiet again. From a more careful inrvey of tbe field we are of?the opinion that our estimates of last week of the imount of wool recently purchased were pwibly n little too high. A good many of the farmers nf this county, especially, and alrto of Jefferson, are still holding. Tbe Oadir wool-buyers estimate that three fifths nf tne wool clip of Harrison county ban bean poid, and that two-flfthe, or probably 450,000 pounds, still remain ia tbe hands of tbe farmers. Thk Welliiburg Herald has long main tained that the Connellsvllle coking vein of coal underlaid Brooke county, West Virginia, and Washington county, Penn lylvania. In its last issue it Bays: "We are under a vow never to say anything moro abjut that shaft for coal underlying Wellahurg and contiguous territory; but there is talk again of a narrow guage rail* road from Wheeling to the ConnellsviUe cike region, and that revives it just suffi ciently for one little montion.

Washington, December 9.?In the Sen ate,'on f motion : of Mr. Pendleton, bo machofthe President's annual message as refers to civil service reform, non as sessment of Government employes for po litical purposes, etc., was referred to a select commitiee to examine several branches of seryice with instructions to report at an early day by bill or other wise. On motion of Mr. Davis, of 111., the 8enate resolved that to-day's adjourn ment be until Monday. Mr. Pendleton introduced a joint reso lution for tbe purpose of obtaining the privilego of opening a highway road from the Canada line ol tbe United States and British America, through British Colom bia to Fort Wrangall and Sitka, in Alaska. Referred. On motion of^Ir. Paddock tbe Senate bill providing for the aale of the re mainder of tbe reservation of confeder ated Otoe and Missouris tribes of Indians in Nebraska and Kansas, and- for other purposes,'was taken up. It provides for the sale to actual settlers of said lands, with consent of ssid Indians, the proceeds to be placed to tbe cred't of tbe tribes, and new reservations to oe selected for them, they desiring to quit their present reservation. After debate tbe bill passed. The Vice President laid before the Sen ate a comrnunicrnon from the Secretary of War, transmitting copies of tbe cor respondence bad with t|ie legal represen talives of the Confederate Generals, Bragg and Polk, with a view to tho pur chase of tbeir private papers relatina to the late war, as per act of Juno 10,1880. Tbe Polk papers nave been placed in the hsnds of the Government, with permis sion to use such as are deemed important to the publication now authorized*by l*w. Tbe price asked for the entire collection is ten thousand do'lars. The Brsgg papers have been submitted for the purposo of being catalogued. No presentprice is stipulated for theni.bat they as well as the Polk collection, were ap Eraised in '78 at $10 000, and could doubt 5Bs now be purchased at that sum. The Secretary says that heretofore no purcha ses for archives have been made from Federal oflicers. The great bulk of ac quisitions have been gilts. Ho far as tbe Secretary knows, the only important collections a* yet unohtained, are those under consideration. It is for Congress to say whether justice to those who have freely given the mnet important docu ments, is observed by the purchase of collections. The Vice President also submitted a com munication from the Secretary of State transmitting at tbe requoat of Madame Thiers, the 8th and 9ih volumes of the speeches of Thiers, late President of the French Republic. They were ordered sent to th? Library. Mr. Paddock presented a petition for tbe extension of copyright to foreign authors.

Lord was taken up. It grants ber M,1C0 as arrears of pension for her dead bueband. It was opposed on technical grounds by the members of tbe Pension Committee, as (he requirements of the law htid not been observed as to the time of filing tbe application lor a pension. After debate tbe8enate by a vote of 16 to 33 refused to have the bill read a third time. It thus drops.

HOIIOR. Mr. Baker, of Indiana, from the Com mittee on Appropriations, reported a for tification bill, and it wss ordered printed and recommitted. It appropriates $100, 000 for the protection and repair of forti fications, and $50,000 for the purchase of torpedoes. Mr. Kelly, of Pennsylvania, introdncod a bill repealing the tax on bank checks, medicines, friction matches, bank capital and bank deposits. Referred. Mr. Aldricb, of Illinois, introduced a nill in relation,to the tax on savings banks. Referred. Mr. F.Wood,of New York, said be would like to ascertain how many days the gen tleman on tbe othor side intended to ob struct public business. Mr. Conger-I call the gentleman to or der for unparliamentary .and insolent lan gusse. Mr. F. Wood?If it troubles tbe gentle man I will withdraw that language. Mr. Conger?There must be a limit of tbe impertinence of gentlemen wbo make auch. remsrks whenever a gentleman is willing to meet the demands of bis coun try ana bring in his funding bill for action. We are even willing to postpone the pres ent debate. Mr. Wood?I thought tb? gentleman might indicate when he would permit the funding bill to oome before the House. Mr. McLane then took the floor and pro ceeded to speak on the Senste resolution, replying especially to the speech made yes terday by Mr. Robeson. As that gentleman had laid down tbe Sreposition that no judicial power could e exercised by Congreas, except by ex press grant, tbe twelfth article of the Con stitution was the express grant to Con gress to oount tbe vote tbrongh all time. Tbe idea that tbe Vice Preaident could count the votes; that he who might nave a place on the ticket, should decide what votes should be received and wtjat refect ed, bad never been accepted in the histo ry of tbe country. Over and over again, had tbe subject been debated, and, un happilv, once in tbe hiatory of the coun try, a law bgd been passed, under tbo op? eration of which a connt bad been made which would forever stand a monument of disgtace and diabonor to the country; because that count had counted in a man who hid not received a majority of the electoral votes. The twelfth article pave the House pow er to elect the President under a certain contingency. If the jurisdiction was con* ferred on the tribunal on a certain com in* gency, that tribunal was certainly to judge when that contingency had occurred. The Bouse must judge when the contingency in which it might elect the President had occurred, and the House would not judge of that contingency unless it verified every vote. The twelfth article imposed on the House the actual necessity of counting and verifying the reports. That was a power that could not be delegated. Knowing that the gentlemen on the other Bide meant to set the Consti tution at defiance, it was his hope that he would yet live to see bis party again in the majority in the House. If the gentle men on the other side choose to obstruct business until the day should come for counting the electoral vote let them have the responsibility, let the Democrats await that day and when it comes let them take their seata and see that the votes opened by the Vice President were genuine votes. Let them see that every elector was qualified, and let them take any other step they may. feel pleased to in the way of inquiry and investigation to know whether the elector who had cast their vqtes were qualified electors. If, per chance, they should find, as was the case in '77, that electors had voted who were not qualified, let them bavo the courage to refuse to certify or count such votes, or if they found that the Vice Pres ident had opened certificates where the votes alleged to have been cast were for geries, let them have the courage now and forever to refuse such votes. Let them do as their fathers had done. Take their votes, appoint tellers to count the votes and as honorable representatives of the*people certify to the genuineness of votes, or refuse to certify to it. He had never met a man who had not regretted tht necessity for an Electoral Commis sion, but now be looked back with satis faction upon the fact that the Democratic party baa, both in '77 and '80, their can didates who believed that it was the duty of the House to count tho votes. Every person felt that in the delegation of that power to another tribunal the responsi bility had been with Congress, and if there bad been any sdame or diabonor in its action it rested here. He had for that reason felt at liberty to denounce. that tribunal. He would, however, never cast a vote to create another. He hoped the Democrats would not be influenced either by filibustering or by offensive insinuations that they were hatch ing mischief. Except in the case of the States which had voted for Hancock; there was no question in any State. There was a question and a very serious question as to the vote of the State of Georgia. He could not conceive a more|deteatib!e|thiog than rejecting the vote of a State, except voting a State against its will. That wan the crime of the Republican party. It bad accepted perjury and forgery as a means of certifying votes. In the face of this fact the gentleman on the other side stood bereaud endeaved to give the Vice Presi dent power to count the votes. It was an attempt at usurpation that looked to the future, and there was no legitimate action that was not justifiable to defeat that pur poae. A joint running debate then onaued, participated-in by McLane.CAlkins, Hun ton, Cor, (NT. Y ) and Mills, during the course of which Mills intimated bis oppo sition to the pending resolution on the ground that under its provisions the Sen* ate might declare who was President. Mr. Lapham said that at tbe last session he had looked upon the pending measure ob an attempt to debauch the electoral vote. Why were the wheels of legislation now blocked to consider a question when it was admitted that there was no necessity whatever for the opera tion of the extraordinary provisions of the resolution? That there was lying be* hind it some purpose, be was bound to as sume from the tenacity with which tho matter was pressed. Under its provisions, questioning a return would justify a ? majority ? in? rejecting the vote of a Slate. It provided that if more votes than are on the list of electoral votes,4'or papers purporting to be such a list," were received from a State, either House may refuse to receive the vote. What was this paper? An offiial paper? Not at all, hut a paper certified by the Chairman of a Democratic State Committee would answer the requirements of that provision. The Republicans were willing to justify themselves in resorting to every expedient known to parliament ary usage to resist the purpose of this res olution. Mr. Herbert argued in opposition to the theory that the Vice-President bad aright to connt tbe vote. He denied that there was any political motive which induced the Democrats to press the matter, unless the desire to prevent tho theory that tbo Vice President had the power to declare who was his successor from passing into a precedent, were a political motive. Mr. Newberry ipadean elaborate argu ment in support of the proposition that the power to count the votes was vested in the Vice-President The proposed role was unconstitutional in that it attempted totafee from the President of the Senate certain powers and rights and vest them in the two Houses. Pending further debate, the House ad journed. '

The subject of tbe reorganization of the Bepublican party in tbe South by inviting the co-operation of all prqgresaive men, without regard to their past political affil iations, was warmly discussed, and speecbos were made in its favor by Col.

Washington, December 9. ?A joint catictiB of the Republicans of the Senate and House was bold in the ball ot the House of Representatives for the purpose of determining upon a party policy in re gard to the Senate concurrent resolution, now pending in the House, which pro* vldes for the adoption of a specific joint rule to regulate the counting of the Electoral vote. Between eighty and ninety were in attendance. The de hate, which occupied two hours and a half was quite general. Among those who t <ok part were Senatora Blaine, Anthony, Ferry, and Teller, and Representatives Lapham, liawley, Conger, Keller, Has kell, Butterworth, Hiscock and Robeson. The only question upon which any differ ence of opinion was expressed was to the extent to which it should be considered neceseary or advisable to oppose the adoption of the pending rule. While none of the speakers believed there was anv purpose on the part of the Democrats to attempt the renewal of the result of the recent Presidential election, or that any danger at the present juncture need be anticipated from the adoption of the pro posed joint rules, the majority held lihat a great principle was at stake, which might at some time affect the stability of our institutions, and that the policy of the party should be to meet the isaue now and to resist, by every known parliamentary method, the adop tion of tbeproposition,unwarranted by the Constitution and at variance with the precedents of the past. At the conclusion of the debate a vote was taken upon Judse Lapnam's resolutions, declaring it to be "the sense of the caucus that the Repub lican minority should resist the adoption of this joint rule by all means authorised by parliamentary law," and without dis sent it was adopted. SlfKRMAN AND GRANT. In the matter of the retirement of Gen eral Sherman, the General has lately re peatedly stated to his intimate friends that be Bhould celebrate bis sixty-second birth day, which comes in April next, by vol untarily retiring from the army. He can retire on three-fourths pay, which is about ten thousand dollars a year. This will give Sheridan a chance to command the army, although the office of General of the Army expirea with Sherman's retirement or death. If he should retire, as contem plated, it fa possible that Congreas will re vive the office again and give it to Grant, unless provision ia made for him be- 1 fore that time, which is more prob able. Indeed, among members of Con gress, there is considerable unanimity of sentiment in favor of creating an office for Grant bofore the adjournment of the ? present Congress. This feeling is shared by many Democrats, who are in foil ac 1 cord with the (entiments expressed by the 1 President in his message on this subject. General Grant will arrive here on Mon day afternoon next. He will be received | by the Boys in Blue and other organiza tions, though the big reception will not i take place until the Wednesday following, i the arrangements for which will* not be | made until neit week. General Grant | will be accompanied by Mrs. Grant, and | will stop at the residence of General Beall. | He will remain here about ten days. i FRACTIONAL CURRENCY. . Senator Ingalls said to day be should press bis bill providing for the reissue of fractional currency, lie thinks the pub lie convenience demands a certain amount of it for transmission through the mails. Senator Rirkwood suggested to-day the propriety of having instead a certificate issued to postmasters in sheets, like stamps, of the denomination of ten, twenty-five and fifty contp, to be sold to aoplioants for transmission of small amounts through the mails, these certifi cates to be redeemed at sub-treasuries or national depositories. He thinks that in this way it would be kept out of common circulation, for which silver coin is better. TUB YORKTOWM ,)f EM0UIAL. Tbo subcommittee of the Yorktown joint Congressional Committee will meet to morrow to select a site for the proposed monument to commemorate the surren der of Cornwallis. Their decision will be reported to the full committee on Friday. Lieut.

It was re ported that a conference was held here in which Senator Conklingand vice Presi dent-elect Chester A. Arthur participated, when the arrangement was perfected.

Bile of Talk About Mntirrs nt (be Metro* polls?A Fiend In tlomnu Form. Naw York, December 9.?The Com missioners of Oharities have just rescued three immigrant girls from a life of im morality. Their names are Maria Ari gassi, Louise Ponati and Magdalena Blades, natives of Paris, from 19 to 23 rears of age, and exceedingly pretty. They were engaged as domestics by a man named Xavier Willeon, a resident of SE. Louis, who represented himself as tbe owner of a splendid new hotel in that city, and who promised them easy work and large wages, besides agreeing to pay tbeir fare to this country. They were passenger* on the Periere, and after their arrival were taken to a French boarding house on Wooster street. During the voyage Wil leon dropped some hints which rendered the sirla suspicious of his intentions to* wards them, and at the boarding bou*e their suspicions were confirmed. Tele graphic inquiry to tbe St. Louis police oronounced Willeon's hotel story a hoax, and the girls visited Castle Garden and made complaint against Willeon, stating that he had all their clothing locked in bis trunks and refused to give them up. A detective went to the Wooster street house and recovered the clothing, but not until be had been compelled to knock Willeon down. Situations have been found in New York forall'tbreeof the girls. S1TK FOB TBI WORLDS FAIR. The World's Fair Committee has adopt ed a report recommending tbe Inwood site for the exhibition of 1883. The site is about eight miles out tbe New York Cen tral and Hudson River Railroad, and con tains 250 acres. FBARS FOR T1IB FATB OF A SHIP. The Anchor Line steamer Victoria, which left London November 14, has not yet been heard from. She is now eleven days overdue. On board were one hun dred passengers and a valuable cargo. The igeut thinks she has met with an accident to her machinery. Five European steam 9rs have arrived within the past twenty 'our hours, and a number of other over Jueve se's are expected shortly. Thesteam era now in met heavy westerly gales and high seas. The Rbola, twenty-five days from Cardiff, reports a terrific g^le thai aited from the 2lat to the 20th. On the 27th it increased to a hurricane, in which ;he ship had her life boats stove in, and ibout twenty feet of her rail was carried iway. COMPLAINTS FROM IMMIGRANTS. The steamer Switzerland, of the ReK Star Line, which arrived vosterdav, jrought 430 steerage passengers and 82 persons in the cabin, nearly all of tbe ormer German and Swedish immigrauts, jut a small party of Englishmen bound or Nebraska were of the number. In their ormal and sworn affidavits tbe English party declare that the Switzerland adver tised to sail from Hull, November 17th,and London on the 18th, and tbe tickets they purchased contained that contract. At the lafit moment, however, they were told that tbey must go to Antwerp and tho Switzerland would not touch at English porta. They were shipped to Antwerp in two small coasters and lodged for the night in filthy places with bedding made of wet straw. Next morning they were hustled on board the steamer, only ten minutes being allowed for 430 passengers .to get aboard. TDK MISERIES Or THE VOYAGE. Some wero rudely treated, even to the extent of being kicked and pushed. They found the steerage wet and dirty and tho bedding water soaked, no separation of sexes whatever, and only three lamps lighted in the entire bold, and objects not discernsble a few feet away. Men and women slept promiscuously about during the whole long voyage, about twenty days. The most disgraceful immorality is said to have prevailed. To use the language of one of the men, "The ship was nothing less than a floating hell." Home of tbo passengers could find no bunks, and slept on the deck. Some of the bunks broko down. Only two gallons of fresh water was furnished in the morning for four hundred and thirty people to wash with. It Is alleged that the officers laughed at the passengers' complaints. The com* plaints of the German passengers were of the same tenor as those of the English. Some of the sailors, also, were ill-treated, and one man well nigh-killed.
