We regret that space does not per­ mit of our printing the message in full, but will give a brief This government stands for n|an hood first and for business only? as an adjunct of manhood. We wish to secure as fair treat­ ment for the small town as for $the big city for the small shipper as tn^such a republic ^i Qt^S^^he one thing that we cannot afford to neglect is the problem of turning out decent citizens. Individual capitalist and in­ dividual wageworker are alike en­ titled to the protection of the law and must alike obey the Jaw. This government is not and never shall be government by a pliltocracy. This government is not and never shall be government by a mob. AH contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be for­ bidden by law. More and more, war is coming to be looked upon as in itself a lament­ able and evil thing.. As the world is now, only that nation is equipped for peace that knows how to fight and that will not shrink from fighting i'fever the conditions become such that war is demanded in the name of the high­ est morality. We cannot have too much im­ migration of the right sort and should have none whatever of the wrong sort. These corporations doing an in­ terstate business are subjects with­ out a sovereign. We should assert the sovereignty of the national government. All private car lines and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the interstate com­ merce commission. Congress should consider the federal government's duty with re­ spect to insurance transactions. Our navy is for the present suffi­ ciently large. Sate and Supper.
