Austrians Are Greatly Dissatis fied With State of the War. May Make a Separate Peace at Any Time. THEY BLAME THE GERMANS Their Army Used to Stop In vasion of Prussia Enabling Servia to Wrest Their Victory From Them. By J. W. T. Mason. New Tork, Dec. 15. The recapture of Belgrade by the Servians Is the cli max of an accumulation of Austro Hungarian mysteries. The Hapsburg empire is now feeling the strain of the war almost at its breaking point. There must be a first nation among the many belligerents to show signs of exhaustion and popular resentment against continuation of the war. Austro-Hungary is now giving evi dence that she is the one. The inexplicable collapse of Aus tria's offensive in Servia should pro duce a dispair through the empire proportionate to the extreme delight felt when the Serbs apparently had been crushed a fortnight ago. The blow will be far more serious In its moral effect than a victory by Rus sia at Austria's territorial expense would produce. From vast Independent sources come evidences that Austro-Hungary is a.mopt prepared to cry quits on any reasonable terms; certainly there is much disaffection among the non-German people of the empire who com prise 75 per cent of the population. A belief is spreading that the Austro Hungarian armies are being used primarily not to defend their own country but to prevent a Russian in vasion of Germany. There can be no doubt that the Hungarians in particu lar are extremely bitter against the German general staff. Reports are circulating in Budapest that an effort to persuade the German emperor to pay greater attention to the defense of Galicia and Hungary has met with a severe rebuke. Open Resentment. While Galicia is largely in the hands of the Russians, who also are reported in northern Hungary, the re se tment of the non-German-part of Franz Joseph's empire is openly un derstood. Even Austria's disaster in. Servia is being blamed on the German staff. The Hungarians are declaring the necessities of the German .cam paign compel a large withdrawal of the Austro-Hungarian forces from Servia, and this accounts for the pres ent national humiliation. Such may not be the true reason for Servia's unlooked-for success, but the circulation of anti-German criticism in Hungary is a serious matter, whether it be true or not. It is naturally accentuated by such circumstances as Germany's public rebuke to her ally, analyzed in this column yesterday. Presumably, only a victory against Russia or new success in Servia will be able to stop Austro-Hungary's growing dissatisfaction with the war. If by any possibility short of a Galician disaster, men can be spared from the northern front, the Austrian general staff will doubtless make fresh concen trations against Servia. If this can not be done and, if the Slavs are able to capture Prezmysl and Cracow, there are many indications that a formidable movement will be begun in Austro Hungary for a separate peace. Even a lesser disaster might bring about this condition. BACK IN BELGRADE Servians Hare Retaken Their Capital From Anstrians. Occupation by the Enemy Last ed but Two Weeks. Ixmdon. Dec. 15. Belgrade, the un fortified capital of Servia, which the Austrians after a long and terrible bombardment, occupied two weeks ago, is again in the possession of the Ser vians. A dispatch from Nish, the temporary capital of the country, received in Lon don early this morning, makes the an nouncement that Servian troops have re-entered the city, thus crowning their recont surprising victory against the Austrian Invaders of their territory. The telegram from Nish is brief and says merely that the city has been oc cupied. To the present time it has not been followed by an admission from any Austrian source. Austrian arms have been figuring prominently of late in the war. The Austrian progress across the Carpa thians from the passes of which thev have been clearing the Russians having been one of the positive factors In the fighting, in the last few days. In the eastern arena. North of thrt Vistula, along the Mlawa front the struggle seems to be favor- inp the Russians, but neither side claims a decisive victory anywhere along the eastern front. The final en gacement still remains to be fought be tween Lofiz ana the Vistula. Vienna Owns Vp. Vienna, Dec. 1 5. The abandonment of Belgrade by the Austrians is ac knowledged in an official statement given out at army headquarters today. i ne statement follows: "In the southern theater of war the retirement of our right wing In volved a cnange In the militarv situa tion which made it advisable for us to abandon Belgrade, which was evac uated without fighting.

WATSONTO STATE Former Indiana Congressman Before Kansas Day Club. Ex-Governor Bailey Another Attraction at the Banquet. James Watson, former congressman from Indiana and one of the most noted Republican orators of the country, is in prospect as one of the principal speakers at the Kansas Day club ban quet, here next month. His presence is not definitely assured but is being counted upon with considerable confi dence. Former Governor Willis J. Bailey has definitely accepted an invi tation to be one of the two principal speakers at the banquet. He will be assigned next the last place on the program and has agreed to deliver a fairly lengthy address. vernon Day of Anthony, who win give one of the ten minute speeches as signed to the numerous home-grown orators who will fill up the earlier part of the evening's program, has signified his readiness to respond to the cluD s Invitation. Each of the congressional districts of the state will be represent ed by some clever talker, to each of whom will be allotted ten minutes time Governor Bailey and Mr. Day are the only two speakers who have thus far been definitely assigned places. Bailey Is a director of the federal re serve bank in Kansas City and is an able speaker. It is probable that one of the largest crowds In the history of the Kansas Day club will attend the banquet next month. With the state legislature in session and meetings of the state edi torial association and state bar asso ciation being held on the date of the banquet, it is probable that every seat at the banquet tables will be sold in advance. CITY OUT OF WATER. Petrogrnd's Supply Is Cut Off by Ice Blockade. Petrograd, Dec. 16. Petrograd . was without water supply today. There are grave fears of a possible disaster in cafe of fire and the danger of biases being started by spies who may be in the Russian capital is believed to be acute- This is the first time in thirty years that Petrograd has suffered from a lack of water. The supply has been cut off by ice blocking the conduits from the Neva from which the city's water supply is taken. All factories, tea shops, public baths and other In stitutions were closed today. Horses used in drawing carts and cabs in the city as well as other animals were forced to go without water.

WANT STATE TO DEAHURDEtlS Hutchinson Fair Has Lost $17, 110 in Last Two Years. Now It Asks Kansas for 9107,000 Investment. REL'EQER E!G ATTECDOE? Well, Hutchinson Shows Entire Receipts of Only $29,000. What About Coming Losses to Show in the Southwest! In two years that the Hutchinson fair has been operating as a state institu tion, it has lost $17,110.92. according to the biennial report of the board of state fair managers, filed today with Gov ernor Hodges. In the face of this loss. the Hutchinson fair management is sending a lobby to the legislature to urge the appropriation of $107,000 for new buildings and maintenance and will base their arguments on the theory that it is a good investment. The biennial report which comes from the Hutchinson fair is one of the most puzzling documents filed by any state Institution. Not only does the report of the fair managers show that the In stitution has been losing money at the rate of $8,555 a year on their own state ment, but it shows that even with the $17,000 deficit which the Hutchinson Commercial club met, that the fair -as sociation is still in a most unhealthy financial condition. The kindest thing that can be said about the Hutchinson fair is that it hasn't a dollar in the world. The deficits formerly met by the local Com-nerclal club, are now to be shouldered on the state, under the items included in the fair association's budget. All during the fair meets oX 1913 and 1914, Hutchinson was busy send ing out reports concerning the tre mendous attendance at her big show. Some days see the booster reports from the fair the attendance at the fair was as high as 50,000. On spe cial days 75,000 people visited the Hutchinson show so the reports said. How About Those Big Admissions? But here is the cold blooded truth about the fair, as told in the biennial report of the fair managers. In 1913, the total admissions collected were $19,789. The admission fee for adults is fifty cents. Based on attendance of adults, the average attendance for the five days, cash admissions, was 7,815. Children were admitted-to the grounds for 26 cents. Tfitrgro8S re ceipts for 1913 would permit 15,631 children's tickets for each day f the fair. Or, making the admissions one half adults, one-half children, would make an average daily attendance of 11.723. That is quite a bit short of 7K 000 riollv a ttano nnA r n il ------ - VI QTVU OV,- V POO daily attendance. In fact, on this oasis, me attendance for the entire five days would be but 68,616. In 1914. the fair association collected total admissions in the amount of $29, 784.30. Still; the fair lost money during both years. In 1913, the Hutchinson Commercial club agreed to provide a deficit of $20. 000 to meet any losses in 1913 and 1914. That deficit Was provided that the Hutchinson institution might make a "showing." It made a showing. But after the fair the Commercial club met and dug up $12,568.81 to cover a deficit In addition to this amount, the fair as sociation had collected in Insurance from burned buildings a total 'of $4, 608.41. which was used to help out the record of the year's assets. The fair last fall also lopt money. The Commercial club was compelled to raise $4,442.11 to meet the deficit. In addition to this deficit, the associa tion had received "donations" total ling $100. This money is also spent. But the report leaves doubt as to whether the report really covers all expense ' items. For instance, there was the secretary's salary. In 1913, the secretary was' paid $1,040.90. This year the secretary drew $2,395.69 for his services. Whether there still re mains a deficit in the secretary's sal ary is not explained in the report. Worked State Labor. That isn't all. Because the legisla ture had conferred upon Hutchinson the official title as state fair, the Hutchinson management Induced the penal board to permit the working of convict labor from the state reforma- tory on the fair grounds and buildings. ! No items of expense for such labor is' included in the expense report. But I even with labor for upkeep of grounds and buildings, donated by the state. the fair association lost more than $17,000. Whether the agreement with the Hutchinson Commercial club calls for a return of the $17,000 as soon as state aid is secured, is not mentioned in the board s report. Neither is reference made as to whether the Hutchinson or ganization will continue to finance the fair in event the state fails to provide the desired aid. Under the budget submitted by the Hutchinson fair, the state is asked to set aside $107,000 for the management and upbuilding of the fair during the next two years. Of this amount 330.- 000 is to be used for "maintenance." Funds under this heading may be used to meet any deficit through misman agement of the fair, or through a shrinkage of receipts in event the fair continues to slump in box office re ceipts.

Sev eral German trenches and a number of prisoners were captured and substan tial progress made." Such confident claims have been made by the allies during the last week concerning the success or tneir new movement against the German line that the Berlin. military authorities have Is sued a special statement to contradict them. The French official statements in particular have reported a long series of victories including the destruction of a number of German batteries, the cap ture of trenches and the rout of the Germans in infantry attacks, along the whole line.

CAVE OF GOLD Another Bonanza Mine Discov ered at Cripple Creek. Gold Pours Like Water in River, Is Report. - Denver. Colo.. Dec. . Gold is pouring like water from the Cresson strike at Cripple Creek, according to advices received here from Cripple Creek. Some of the leading gold producers nf fnlrtrnrio hnve heen nermitted to inspect the bonanza chamber of the property and the sight of a chamber fun 0f virgin gold, glittering under tne dim ,,, of the miners, has stunned them. Manager Smale of the Portland mine says that the Cresson ore, struck at 1,200 feet below the surface, upsets all previous theories of the United States geological survey. The experts estimated the value of the ore from five to one hundred million dollars. The chamber where the gold is be ing mined with picks, the ore being too soft for blasting. Is sealed with a heavy steel door similar to a bank vault and the miners work under guard. There are numerous small cavities in the sylvinate walls and from this gold grain pours in rivulets without being mined. It is declared that the cave of gold, for such it is, was found to contain large quantities of broken ore, made up of decomposed quarts, and pure gold nuggeta of large size. BIG CHRISTMAS MAIL.
