WU1CII Jl W PrF Seriously, however, when the Ga zette must choose between lnvoring the suffrage of loyal negroes and dis loyal rebels it will unhesitatingly ad- vocate the former. It would rather j let a loyal black man who has fought for his eountrv vote, than a white traitor whether iu the form of a stay-at-home peace Copperhead or a South ern rebel. And if the rebels persist in rejecting the Constitutional Amend ment the Gazette is in favor of taking the State government eutirely out of their hands and putting them in charge of the loyal element of the South without regard to its color. The white loyalists of the South already demand this, and ir the contingency mentioned it would be but doing them necessary j justic. j ": Out of all the millions of rebels who j , . . - . .u - 1 tooK ud arms lixaiuBt tuo uhjcu., iuu. . , , v : tbe Constitutional amenameut, wueu it becomes a law, disfranchises about 30,000. These have every one violated a solemn oath to support the Consti tution of the Coked States, and were the leaders who organized the rebel lion aud mauaged it to the end. Many of them have been high in office in the Federal Government and have shamefully abused their trust to pro mote the works of treason. They are guilty ol the double crime of betray ing thei country and deluding the masses erf tire Southern people into the toils of rebeiljoo. They have corrupt ed Southern public sentiment and in fused it with disloyalty and hatred of the North. They are chiefly respon sible for the sl-irvation and slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers and for our being burdened with an iinmence national debt. They brought uDoii the North und South alike unrold woe and suffering. For all theee crimes it is proposed to punish them merely by disqualification from again holding office. Yet North ern Democrats join Southern rebels iu denouncing this as a humiliation to the South ! The Ifftrnr refuses t- accept it because it touches her honor ! What a wonder that a ense of honor so del icate did not cause her to refrain from nefarious rebellion !

Thus the. slanderer is compelled to vindicate h:juself from his own slander and to apologize for in dulgence in that for which he has all his lifetime boen professing to condemn and despise ethers ! Alas, alas, for the Democracy! Sooner would we htive expected a notorious thief to make ex cuses for being honest, or a common uruntara to grow indignant at an ac cusation of sobriety, than thatit should come to this. Nor is the rase mitigated by the Her ald's very lame attempt to raise a ques tiod of veracity with the Gazette. "ot only have all the Democratic papers we mentioned last week followed in the wake of the Chicago Times, but also the Philadelphia Age, New York fciun, and Boston Post, all notorious copper bead sheets. Kven the Xew York World, whose orthodoxy the Herald will not deny, has indulged in such lan guage as tbe following: "Whenever the negroes set auy value on elective franchise, they will lie able to command it.

In scouting negro suffrage as a thing never to be tolerated, the ex treme Southern party display just as little wisdom or foresight." Tbe Herald displays lamentable ig norance in reading out of its party such representative Democratic sheeta as the Milwaukee News, Buffalo Courier and Washington Star.

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. Fellow-citizen of the Senate ami House of Representative : After a brief interval the Congress iiii tne timrea orates resumes its an- nual legislative labors. An all-wise and merciful Providence has abated the pestilence which visited our shores, leaving its calamitous traces upon some portions of our country. Peace.order. ... , . ..- . . ' , rrnnnmhtv. an-l civil imthnntv hnvn ! beeD formally declared to exist throughout the whole of the United States. In all of the States civil au thority has superseded the coercion of arms, and the people, bv their volun- ! tary action, aie maintaining their gov eromeuts in full activity and complete operation. the enforcement ot the laws is no longer "obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings;" and the ani mosities engendered by the war are rapidly yielding to the benificent in fluence! of our free institutions, and to the kindly effects of unrestricted social and commercial intercourse. An entire restoration of fraternal feeling must be tbe earnest wish of every pa triotic heart,' ahd we will have accom plished our grandest national achieve ment whea, forgettiDg the sad events of the past, and remembering only their instructive lessons, we resume ous an(j umted people. In my message of the 4th of Decem- b r. 1SG5, Congress was ioformed of the measures which had been institut- , , . , . , . . . ed by the Executive with a view to the gradual restoration of the States in which the insurrection occurred to their relations with the General Gov ernment. Provisional Governors had been appointed. Conventions called, Governors elected, .Legislatures assem bled, and -Senators aDd Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United States. Courts bad been opened for the enforcement of laws long in abey ance. The blockade had been remov ed, custom-houses re-established, and the internal revenue laws put in force, in order that the people might contri bute to the national income. Postal operations had been renewed, and ef forts were being made to restore them to their former conditions of efficiency. The States themselves had been asked to take part iu the high function of amending the Constitution, and of thus sanctioning tbe extinction of African slavery as one of the legitimate results oi our internecine struggle. Having progressed thus far, the Ex ecutive Department fouud that it bad accomplished nearly all that was with in the scope of its constitutional au thority. One thing, however, yet re mained to be dooe beiore the work of ! restoration could be completed, and that was the admission to Congress of loyal Senators and Representatives from the States whose people bad re belled against the lawful authority of the General Government. This ques tion devolved upon the respective Houses, which, by the Constitution, are made the judges of elections, re turns and qualifications of their own members; and its consideration at once engaged the attention of Con gress In ilm meantime, tbe Execuitve De parimect no other plan having been proposed by Congress continued its efforts to perfect, as far as was practi cable, the restoration of the proper re- lanonh oeiween too citizens oi tne re- ; spective States, the States and the Fed- i l,ave become valid as a part of the Constitution nt the United States. All of the States io which the insurrection had existed promptly amended their Constitutions., su as to make them conform to the greatchaDge thus effec ted in the organic law of the land ; de clared null and void all ordinances and laws of secession : repudiated all pretended debts aud obligations crea ted for the revolutionary purposes of the insurrection ; and proceeded, iu good faith, to the enactment of meas ures for the protection and ameliora tion of the condition of the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesita ted to admit any of these states to rep resentation j and it was not until to wards the close of the eighth month of the session that an exception was made in favor of Tennessee, by the ad mission of her Senators and Represen tatives. I deem it a subject of profound re gret that Congress lias thus far failed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Representatives from the other States, whose inhabitants, with those of Ten nessee, had ensaged in the rebellion. Ten S'ntes more than one-fourth of the whole number remaiu without repress utation : the seats of fifty mem bers are yet vacant not by their own consent, not by a failure of election hat by a refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their admission, it is believed, would have accomplished much toward the renewal and strength ening of our relations as one people, and removed serious cause for discon tent on the part of the inhabitants of those States. It would have ac corded with the great principle enun ciated in the Declaration or American Independence, that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation, aud yet be denied the right ot representation It would nave been in conson iree with the express provisions of the Constitution, that '"each State shall h:ive at least one Representative," and "that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in tne Senate." These provisions were intended to secure to erery fctate, and to the people of every State, the right of represention in each House of Congress: ana so important was it deemed by the framers of the Consti tution, that the equality of the States in tbe Senate should be preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Constitution, can any State, without its consent be denied a voice in that branch of the National Legislature. It is true, it has been assumed that theexistence ot the States was termin ated by the rebellious acts of their 10 habitants, and that the insurrection having been suppresseii, they were thenee-forward to be considered mere ly as conquered territories. The Leg islative. Executive, and Judicial -De partments of the Government have, however, with great, distinctness and uniform consistency, refused .ta -sekt tio etrirssuffiption so incompatible with the nature ot our republican sys tem, and with the professed objects of the war. 1 hrouebout the recent leg islation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes itself apparent, that these ten political communities are nothing less than states ot this Union. At the very commencement of the rebel lion, each House declared, .with a unanimity as remarkable as it was sig nificant, that the war was not "waged upon our part, in any spirit of oppres sion, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of over throwing or interfering with the rights or established institutions ot those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the Union with all the dig nity, equality, and rights ot the several States unimpaired: and that as soon as these objects" were accomplished the war ought to cease. in some in stances. Senators were permitted to continue their legislative functions while in other instances Representa tives were elected and admitted to seats after their States had formally declared their right to withdraw from the Union, aud were endeavoring to maintain that right by force of arms All of the States whose people were io insurrection, as States, were inclu ded in the apportionment of the direct tax ot twenty millions ot dollars annu ally laid upon the United States by the act approved th August 1861 Congress, by the act of March 4, 1862 and by the apportionment of represta tion thereunder, also recogoized their presence as States in the Union : and they have, for judicial purposes, been divided into districts, as States alone can be divided. The same recognition aooears in the recent legislation in reference to Tennessee, which evident ly rests upon the fact that the functions of the State were not destroyed by the rebellion, but-merely suspended; and that principle i of course applicable to those States which, like tennessee. attempted to reuouoce tneir places in the Linion. The action of the Executive Depart ment ot the tiovernment upon this subject has been equally definite and uniform, and the purpose ot the war was specifically stated in the Procla mation issued by my predecessor on the 22d day . of September, 1862. It was then solemnly proclaimed and de clared that "hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the ob ject of practically restoring the consti tutional relation between the united States and each of the States and the people thereof, in which States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed." The recognition of the States by the Judicial Department of the Govern ment has also been clear and conclu sive in all proceedings affecting tbem as States, had in the Supreme, Cir cuit, and District Courts. In the admission of Senators and Representatives from any and all of the States, there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the pow ers of legislation ; for this could not happen when the Constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each House is made the "judges of the elections, re turns, and qualifications of its own members," and may. "with the con currence of two-thirds, expel a mem ber." When a Senator or Representa tive presents his certificate of election he may at ones be admitted or reject ed ; or, should there be any question as to his eligibility, his credentials may be referred for investigation to the appropriate committee. If admit ted to a seat, it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a member, that he pos sesses the requisite constitutional and legal qualifications. If refused ad mission as a member for want of due allegiance to the Government, and re turned to bis constituents, they are ad monished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed a voice in the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon this question so vitaly affecting the restoration of the Union and the permanency of our present form of government, my con victions, heretofore expressed, have undergone no change ; but, on the contrary, their correctness has been confirmed by reflection and time. If the admission of loyal members to seats in the respective Houses of Con gress was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and expedient now. If this anomalous condition is right now if, io the exact condition of these States at tho present time, it is lawful to exclude them from rep resentation, I do not see that the ques tion will be changed by the efflux of tin:e. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of repre sentation will be no stronger-the right of exclusion will be no weaker. The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the Presi dent to recommend to the considera tion of Congress "such measures as he shall judge necessary or expedient." 1 know of no measure more imperi tively demanded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy and equal justice, than the admission of loyal members from the now unrep resented States. This would consul ate the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary influenco in the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and fraternal feelinir. It would tend creat- ly to renew the confidence of the Amer-1 ican people in the vigor and stability of their institutions. It would bind us more closely as a nation, and enable us to show to the world the inherent and recuperative power of a Govern ment founded upon the will of the people, and established upon the prin ciples of liberty, justice, and intelli gence. Oar increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irrefraga bly demonstrate the fallacy of the ar guments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disor ders by the enemies of republican gov ernment. The admission of loyal members from the States now exclud ed from Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn eapital. now awaiting an opportunity for in vestment, into the channels of trade and industry. It would alleviate the present troubled condition of those States, and, by inducing emigration, aid in the settlement of fertile regions now uncultivated, and to an increased production of those staples which have added so greotly to the wealth of the nation and the commerce of the world. New fields of enterprise would be opened to our progressive people, and soon the devastations of war would be repaired, and all traces of our domes tie differences effaced from the minds of our countrymen. In our efforts to preserve "the unity of Government which constitutes us one people," by restoring the States to the condition which they held prior to the rebellion, we should be cautious, lest, having rescued our nation from perils of threatened disintegration, we resort to consolidation, and in the end absolute despotism, as a remedy tor the recurrence ot similar troubles. The war having terminated, and with it all occasion for the exercise of pow ers of doubtful constitutionality, we should hasten to bring legislation with in the boundries prescribed by the Constitution, aud to return to the an cient landmarks established by our fathers for the guidance of succeeding generations. "The Constitution which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." "If in ths opinion of the people, tne distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be, in any particular, wrong, let it be correct ed ry an amendment in the way in which the Constitution designates. liut let there be no change by usurpa tion ; for 'it is the customary weap on by which free Governments are de stroyed." Wash;ngton spoke these words to his countrymen, when, followed by their love and trratitude he voluntarily retired from the cares of public lite. I o keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional powers, and cherish the Federal Uni on as the only rock of safety," were prescribed by Jefferson as rules of ac tion to endear to his "countrymen the true principles of their Constitution, and promote a union of sentiment and action equally auspicious to their hap piness and safety." Jackson held that the ction cf the General Government should always be strictly confined to the sphere of its appropriate duties, and justly and forcibly urged that our Uoverotuent is not to be maintained nor our Union preserved "by invasions ot the rights nnd powers of the seve ral Statas. In thus attempting to make our General Government stroog, we make it weak. Its true Ftrength con sists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible to themselves : in mating itseit telt, not in its power, but in its beneficence ; not in its control but in its protection ; not in binding tue etates more closely to the center, but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit." These are the teachings of men whose deeds and services have made them il lustrious, and who, long since with drawn from the scenes of life, have left to their country the rich legacy of tneir example, tneir wisdom, and their patriotism. Drawing fresh inspira tion from their lessons, let us emulate them in love of eountry and respect tor tue constitution and the laws. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury affords much information re specting the revenue and commerce of the country, ttis views upon the cur rency, and with reference to a proper adjustment or our revenue system, in ternal as well as import, are commend ed to the careful consideration of Con gress. In my last annual message I expressed my general views upon these subjects, t need now only call atten tention to the necessity of carrying in to every department of the Govern ment a system of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment, and wise econ omy. With no exceptional nor unu sual expenditures, the oppressive bur dens of taxation can be lessened by such a modification of our revenue laws as will be consistent with the public faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report presents a much more satisfactory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated. During the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 18G5, the last year of the war, the public debt was increased $941,902,537, and on tKe 31st of October, I860, it amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 31st day of October, 1866, it had been reduced to ?2,0ol ,310,006, the dimin ution, during a period of fourteen months, commencing September 1. I8 60, and endiog October 31, 1866, hav ing been $20b,3i9.56o. In the last an nual report on the state of the finan ces, it was estimated that during the 1 nrce quarters ot the hscal year end ing the 30th of. Tune last rhnrlerit. would be increased 112,101,0i7. . Du ring that period, however, it was re duced $31,196,387, the receipts of the year having been SP89.90o.90o more. and expenditures $200,529,235 less than theestiraates. Nothing could more clearly indicate than these statements the extent and availability of the na tional resources, and the rapidity and safety with which, under our form of government, great military and naval establishments can be disbanded, and expenses reduced from a war to a peace looting. During the hseal year endine the 30th of June, 1866, the receipts were $558,032,620, and the expenditures $520,740,940, leaving an available sur plus ot ScS7,81,b80. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal vear ending the 30th June, 1867, will be $475,061,386, and that the expendi tures will reach the sum of $316 . 078, leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, it is estimated ttiat tbe receipts will amount to $436.- 000,000, and that the expenditures will be $3o0.247.641 showing an ex cess of $85,752,359 in favor of the Government. These estimated receipts may be diminished bv a reduction of excise and import duties ; but after all necessary reductions shall have been made, the revenue of the present and of following years will doubtless be sufficient to cover all legtimate charges upon the Treasury, and leave a large annual surplus to be aon led to the payment of the principal of the debt. There seems now to be good reason why taxes may be reduced as the coun try advances in population and wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished with in tne next quarter or a century. The report of the Secretary of War furnishes valuable and important in formation in reference to the opera tions of his Department during the last year. Few volunteers now remain 111 the service, and they are being dis charged as rapidly as they can be re placed by regular troops. The army has been promptly paid, carefully pro vided with medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted, and is to be furnished with breech-loading small arms. The military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by the dis charge of volunteers, the disposition of unserviceable or perishablo stores, and the retrenchment of expenditure. Sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been retained, and, from the disbanded volunteers stand ing ready to respond to the national call, large armies caa bo rapidly or ganized, equipped, and concentrated.- Fortifications on the coast and fron tier have received, or are beine ore- pared for more powerful armaments ; lake surveys and harbor and river im provements are in course of energetic prosecution. Preparations have been made for the payment of the addition al bounties authorized during the re cent session of Congress, under such ' regulations as will protect the Govern ment from fraud, and secure to the honorably discharged soldier the well earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received artific ial limbs or other surgical apparatus ; and forty-one national cemeteries, con taining the remains of 104,526 Union soldiers, have already been established. The total estimate of military appro priations is $25,205,669. It is stated in the report of the Sec retary of the Navy that the naval force at this time consists of two hundred and seventy-eight vessels, armed with two thousand three hundred and fifty one guns. Of these, one hundred and fifteen vessels, carrying one thousand and twentj -nine guns, are in commis sion, distributed chiefly among seven squadrons. The number of men in the service is thirteen thousand six hundred, fireat activity and vigilance have been displayed by all the squad rons, and their movements have been judiciously and efficiently arranged iu such manner as would best promote American commerce, and proteet the rights and interests of our countrymen abroad. The vessels unemployed are undergoing repairs, or are laid up un til their services may be required. Most of the iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, a place whieh, until decisive action should be taken by Congress, was se lected by the Secretary of the Navy as the most eligible location for that class of vessels. It is important that a suit able pubiic station should be provided for the iron-clad fleet. It is intended that these vessels shall be in proper condition tor any emergency, and it is desirable that the bill accepting League Island for naval purposes, which pass ed the House of Representatives at its last session, should receive final action at an early period, in order that there may be a suitable public station for this class of vessels, as well as a navy- yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service, on the .Delaware river. The Naval Pension fund amounts to $11,750,000, having been increased $2.- o0.00O during the year. 1 he expend itures of the Department for the fiscal year ending 30th June last were $43,- 324,520, and the estimates for the com ing year amount to $23,568,436. At tention is invited to the condition of our soamen, and the importance of leg islative measures for their relief and improvement. The suggestions in be half of this deserving class of our fel low-citizens are earnestly recommend ed to the favorable attention of Con gress. The report of the Postmaster Gen eral presents a most satisfactory con dition of the postal service, and sub mits recommendations which deserve the consideration of Congress. The revenues of the Department for t he yer ending June 30, 18bb, were $14, 386,986, and the expenditures $15,352, 079, showing an e.x -oss of the latter of $965,093. In anticipation of this de ficiency, however, a special appropria tion was made by Congress in the act approved July 28, 1866. Including the standing appropriation of $700,000 tor tree mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet remaining unexpended, the actual deficiency for the past year is only $0o,0;w a sum within $51,141 of the amount estima ted in the annual report of 1864. The decrease of revenue compared with the previous year was one and one-fifth per cent., and the increase of expend itures, owing principally to the en largement of the mail service in the South, was twelve percent. On the 30th of June last there were in opera tion six thousand nine hundred and thirty mail routes, with an aggregate length of one hundred and eighty thousand nine hundred and twenty one miles, an aggregate annual trans portation of seventy-one million eight hundred and thirty-seven thousand nine hundred and fourteen miles, and an aggregate annual cost, including all expenditures, of $8,410,184. The length of railroad routes is thirty-two thousand and ninety-two miles, and the annual transportation thirty mil lion six hundred and nine thousand four hundred and sixty-seven miles. The length of steamboat routes is fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-six miles, and the annual trans portation three million four hundred and eleveu thousand nine huudred and sixty-two miles. The mail serviea is rapidly increasing throughout the whole country, and its steady extension in the Southern States indicates their constantly improving condition. The growing importance of the foreign ser vice also merits attention. The Post Office Department of Great Britain and our own have agreed upon a pre liminary basis for a new Postal Con vention, which it is believed will prove eminently beneficial to the commercial interests of the United States, inas much as it contemplates a reduction of the international letter postage to one half the existing rates; a reduction of postage with all other countries to and from which correspondence is trans mitted in the British mail, or in closed mails throush the United Kingdom : the establishment of uniform and rea sonable charges for the sea and terri torial transit or correspondence in closed mails : and an allowance to each Post Office Department of the right to use all mail communications establish ed under the authority of the other for the dispatch of correspondence, ei ther in open or closed mails, on the same terms as those applicable to the nhabitants ot the country nrovidintr the means of transmission. The report of the Secretarv of the Interior exhibits the condition of thote branches of the public service which are committed to his supervision. During the last fiscal year, four million six hundred aud twenty-nine thousand three hundred and twelve acres of pub lic land were disposed of, one million eight hundred and ninety-two thou sand five hundred and sixteen acres of which were entered under the homestead act. The policy originally adopted relative to the public lands has undergone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not their rap id settlement, was the cardinal feature of our land system. Long experience and earnest discussion have resulted in the conviction that the early devel opment of our agricultural resources, and the diffusion of an energetic popu lation over our vast territory, are ob jects of far greater importance, to the national growth and prosperity than the proceeds of the sale of the land to the highest bidder in open market. The pre-emption laws confer upon the pioneer who compiT&s with the terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a limited portion of " unoffered lands " at the minimum price. The homestead enactments relieve the settler from the payment of purchase money, and se cure him a permanent home, upon the condition of residence for a term of years. This liberal policy invites em igration from the old, and from the more crowded portions of the new world. Its propitious results are un doubted, and will be more signally manifested when time shall have given to it a wider development Congress has made liberal grants or' public land to corporations, 111 aid ol the construction of railroads and other internal improvements. Should this policy hereafter prevail, more stringent provisions will bo required to secure a faithful application of the fund. Tho title to the lands should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but remain in the Government and subject to its control until some portion of the road has been actually built. Portions of them might then, from time to time, be conveyed to the corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the whole quantity em braced by the grant than the completed parts bear to the entire length of the projected improvement This reside- tion would not operate to the preju dice of any undertaking conceived in good faith and executed with reasona ble energy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw from market the lands falling within the operation of such grants, and thus to exclude the incep tion ot a suOsequent adverse Tight. A breach of the conditions which Con gress may deem proper to impose should wort a lorteiture of claim to the lands so withdrawn but unconveyed, and of title to the lands conveyed which re main unsold. Operations on the several lines of the Pacific Railroad have been prose cuted with unexampled vigor and suc cess. Should no unforseen causes of delay occur, it is confidently anticipa ted that this great thoroughfare will bo completed before the expiration of theperiod designated by Congress. During the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners, including the expenses of disbursement, was thirteen million four hundred and fifty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-six dollars ; and fifty thousand one hundred and seventy-seven names were added to the pension rolls. The entire number of pensioners, June 30, 1866, was one hundred and twenty-six thousand seven hundred and twenty two. The fact furnishes melancholy and striking proof of the sacrifices made to vindicate the Constitutional authority of the Federal Government, and to maintain inviolate the integrity of the Union. They impose upon us ccrresponding obligations. It is esti mated that thirty-three million dollars will be required to meet the cxigeicies of this branch of the service during the next hscal year. Treaties have been concluded with the Indians who, enticed into armed opposition to our Government at the outbreak of the rebellion, have uncon ditionally submitted to our authority and manifested an earnest desire for a renewal of friendly relations. During the year endiog September 30, 1860, eight thousand seven nun dred and sixteen patents for useful in ventions and designs were issued, and at that date the balance in the Treas ury to the credit of the Patent fund was two hundred and twenty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety seven dollars. As a subject upon which depends an immense amount of the production and commerce of the country, I rec ommend to Congress such legislation as may be necessary lor tho preserva tion of the levees of the Mississippi river. It is a matter or national im portance that early steps should be ta ken not only to add to the efficiency of these barriers against destructive in undations, but for the removal of all obstructions to the free and safe navi gation of that great channel of trade and commerce. The District of Columbia, under ex isting laws, is not entitled to that rep resentation in tne iNational councils which, from our earliest history, has been uniformly accorded to each Ter ritory established from time to time within our limits. It maintains pe culiar relations to Congress, to whom the Constitutioi has granted the power of exercising exclusive legislation over the seat of government. Our fellow citizens in the District, whose interests are thus confided to the special guard ianship of Congress, exceed in number the population of several of our Terri tories, and no just reason is perceived why a delegate of their choice should not be admitted to a seat in the House of Representatives. No mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling them to make known their peculiar condition and wants, and of securing the local legislation adapted to them. I therefore recommend the passage of a law authorizing the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a dele gate, to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a delegate representing a Territory. The increasing enterprise and rapid progress of improvement in the District are highly gratifying, and I trust that the efforts of the munic ipal authorities to promote the pros perity of the national metropolis will receive the efficient and generous co operation of Congress. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture reviews the operations of his Department during the past year, and asks the aid of Congress in its efforts to encourage those States which, scourged by war, are now earnestly engaged in the re-organization of do mestic industry. It is a subject of congratulation that, no foreign combinations against our domestic peace and safety, or our le gitimate influence among the nations, have been formed or attempted. While sentiments of reconciliation, loyalty and patriotism have increased at home, a more just consideration of our na tional character and rights has been manifested by foreign nations. The entire success of the Atlantic Telegraph between the coast of Ire land and the Province of Newfound land is an achievement which has been justly celebrated in both hemi-1 spneres as tne opening ot an era in the progress of civilization. There is reason to expect that equal success will attend and even greater results follow the enterprise for connecting the two Continents through the Pacific Ocean by the projected line of telegraph be tween Karuschatka and the Russian possessions in America. The resolutions of Congress pro testing against pardons by foreign eov- ernments of persons convicted of infa mous offenses, on condition of emigra tion to our country, has been commu nicated to the States with which we maintain intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject of complaint on our part, has not been renewed. The congratulations of Congress to the Emperor of Russia, upon his es cape from attempted assassination, have been presented to that humane and enlightened ruler, and received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation. The Executive, warned of an at tempt bv Spanish-American adventur ers to induce the emigration of freed men of tbe United States to a foreign eountry, protested against the project as one which, it consummated, would reduce them to bondage even more oppressive than that from which they have just been relieved. Assurance has been received from the Govern meat of the State in which the plan was matured that the proceeding will meet neitner its encouragement nor approval. It is a question worthy 01 your consideration, whether our laws upon this subject are adequate to the prevention or puuishmcnt of the crime thus meditated. In the month of April last, as Con gress is aware, a friendly arrange ment was made between the Emperor ot trance and the 1'resident ot the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary military forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in three detachments, the first of which, it was understood, would leave Mexico in November, now past, and the second in March next, and the third and last in November, 1867. Immediately upon the comple tion of tho evacuation, tho French government was to assume tho same attitude of non-intervention, in regard to Mexico, as is held by the Govern ment of the United States. Repeated assurances havo been given by the Emperor, since that agreement, that he would complete the promised evao uation within tho period mentioned, or sooner. It was reasonably expected that the proceedings thus contemplated would produce a crisis of groat political inter est in the Republic of Mexico. The newly appointed Minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore sent forward, on the 9lh day of No vember hist, to issume his proper functions us Minister Plenipotentiary of tho United States to that Republio. It was also thought expedient that he should be at.teudod in the vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant General of the Army of the United States, with the view of obtaining such informa tion as might be important to deter mine tho oourse to be pursued by the United States in re-establishing and maintaining proper intercourse with the Repubii j of Mexico. Deeply in terested in the cause of liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever in fluence we possessed for the restoration and permanent establishment in that country of a domestic and republican torm ot government. Such was the condition of affairs in regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d of November last, official information was received from Paris that the Em peror of France had sometime before decided not to withdraw a detachment of his forces in the month of Novem ber, according to engagement, but that this decision was made with the pur pose of withdrawing the whole of those forces in the ensuing sprmg. Ot this determination, however, the United States had not received any notice or ntimation; and, so soon as the inform ation was received by the Government, care was taken to make known its dis sent to the Emperor of France. 1 cannot f orego the hope that t ranee will reconsider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evac uation of Mexico which will conform as nearly as practicable with the exist ing engagement, and thus meet the just expectations of the United States. The papers relating to tl7e subject will be laid before you. It is believed that, with the evacuation of Mexico by the expeditionary forces, no subject for serious differences between France and the United States, would remain. The expressions of the Emperor and people of France warrant a hope that the traditionary friendship between the two countries might in that case be renewed and permanently restored A claim of a citizen of the United States for indemnity for spoliations committed on the high seas by the French authorities, in the exercise ol a belligerent power against Mexico, has been met by the Government of France with a proposition to defer set tlement until a mutual convention for the adjustment of all claims of citizens and subjects of both countries, arising out ot the recent wars on this Couti nent, shall be agreed upon by the two countries. The suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in which claims for indemnity by foreign ers, as well as by citizens of the United States, arising out of the late civil war, shall be adjudicated and determined I have no doubt that the subject of all such claims will engage your attention at a convenient aud proper time. It is a matter of regret that no con siderable advance has been made to wards an adjustment of the differences between the United States and Great Britain, arising out of the depreda tions upon our national commerce and other trespasses committed during our civil war by British subjects, in viola tion of international law and treaty obligations. The delay, however, may be believed to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred in that country dur ing the last session of Parliament. The attention of the new ministry was called to the subject at an early day, and there is some reason to expect that it will now be considered in a becoming and friendly spirit. The importance of an early disposition of the ques tion cannot be exaggerated. W hat ever might be the wishes of the two Governments, it is manifest tiiat good will and friendship between the two countries cannot be established until a reciprocity, in the practice of good faith and neutrality, shall be restored between the respective nations. On the 6th of June last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military ex pedition and enterprise against the British North American Colonics was projected and attempted to be carried on within tho territory and jurisdiction of the United States. In obedience to the obligation imposed upon the Exe cutive by the Constitution, to see that the laws are faithfully executed, all citizerrftwere warned, by proclamation, against taking part in or aiding such unlawful proceeding, and the proper civil, military, and naval officers were directed to take all necessary measures for the enforcement of the laws. The expedition failed, but it has not been without its painful consequences. Some of our citizens who, it was alleg ed, were engaged in the expedition, were captured, and have been brought to trial, as for a capital offense, in the Province of Canada. Judgment and sentence of death have been pronoun ced against some, while others have been acquitted. Fully believing in the maxim of government, that severity of civil punishment for misguided per sons who have engaged in revolution ary attempts which have disastrouly failed, is unsound and unwise, such re presentations have been made to the British Government, in behalf of the convicted persons, as, being sustained by an enlightened and humane judg ment, wilK it is hoped, induce in their cases an exercise of clemency, and a iudieious amnesty to all who were en gaged in the movement. Counsel has been employed by the Government to defend citizens o theUnited States on trial for eapital offences in Canada ; and a discontinuance of the prosecutions wiieri were instituted in the courts of the United States against those who took part in the expedition, has been directed. I have reaaided the expedition as not only political in its nature, but as also in a great measure foreign from the United States in its causes, char acter, and objects. The attempt was understood to be made in sympathy with an insurgent party in Ireland, and. in strikiug at a British Province on this Continent was designed to aid in obtainine redress for political griev ances which it was assumed, the people of Ireland had suffered at the hands of the British Govenment during a period of several centuries. 1 he persons en traeed in it were chiefly natives of that country, some of whom had, while other.sh:id not, become citizens of the United States under our general laws of naturalization. Complaints of mis government in Ireland continually en gage the attention 01 the iiritish na tion, and so great an agitation is now lire vailing in Ireland that the British Government laave deemed it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in that country. These circumstances must necessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have enter tained in regard to an expedition ex pressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as those laws remain upon our statute-books, they should be faithfully executed, and if they operate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively. Con gress alone can supply the remedy, by their modihcation or repeal. Political and commercial interest of the United States are not unlikely to be affected in some degree by events which are transpiring in the eastern regions of Europe, and the tiino seems to havo come when our Government ought to have a proper diplomatic rep resentation in Greece. This Government has claimed for all persons not convicted, or accused or suspected of crime, au absolute polit ical right 01 seir expatriation, ana a choice of now natiounl allegiance. Most of the European htates liuve dis sented from this principle, and bava claimed a right to hold such of their subjects as have immigrated to and been naturalized in the United States. and afterwards returned on tr pnt ! visits to their native eoufries, 10 thj performance of military - ; vice in like manner as resident suf.j ots. Com plaints arising from the clui n in this respect made by foreign St,i''s, have heretofore been matters of coul. oversy betwaen the United States and ftue of the Kuropesin Powers, nnd the irri tation consequent upon the failure to settle this question increased during the war in w hich Prussia, Italy, and Austria we - recently engaged. While Groat Biital 1 tas never acknowledged tho right of expatriation, she has not practically insisted upon it. France has been oqually forbearing; and Prus sia has proposed a compromiao, which, although evincing increased liberality, has not been accepted by the United States. Peace is now prevailing every where in Europe, and the present seems to be a favoraale time for au as sertion by Congress of the principle, so loog maintained by the Executive De partment, that naturalization by one State fully exempts the native-born subject of any other State from the performance of military service under any foreign Government, so long as he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and Benefits. In performance of duty imposed up on me by the Constitution, I have thus submitted to the Representatives of the States and of the People bucIi infor mation of our domestic aud loraign af fairs as tbe public interest seems tore- quire, uur uovercmeni is now uu dergoing its most trying ordeal, aud my earnest prayer is, that tne pern may ik fuccessfully and finally passed, with out impairing its original strength and symmetry. The interests of the na tion are best to be promoted by tne re vival of fraternal relations, the com plete obliteration cf our past differ ence, and the reinaueuration of all the pursuits of peace. Directing our ef forts to the early accomplishment of these great ends, lot us endeavor to preserve harmony between the co-ordinate Departments of the Govern ment, that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operato with the other in securing the maintenance of the Constitution, ti e preservation of the Union, and the perpetuity of our free institutions.
