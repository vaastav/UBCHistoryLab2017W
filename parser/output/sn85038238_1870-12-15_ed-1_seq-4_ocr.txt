Spear thinks they ought, and adduces the follow in;; among cojrent leasons : The ordinarj' plea for bwearing men is that of practical utility. We are told that it increases the certain ty that witnesses will speak the truth, and that public ollicers will faithfully perforin their duties; and hence that, as a means to this end, it is both allowable and proper. This is a question of fact ; and the fact is that we have fcr the result, in multi tudes of cases, perjured witnesses, and in a much larger number of cases perjured officers of law. As a preventitive of falsehood the tivil oath is a failure; and it may well be doubted whether it has ever ad ded any considerable influence in favor of truth. If one has no fear of God before his eyes, swearing him that he will speak the truth or discharge Lis official duties is not likely to increase the certainty that he will do so . rue oath is not a process of reformation, but an ap peal to moral sentiments alreadv existing; and, if these sentiments are not present, then the oath has no power to secure the utterance of truth. If, on the other band, one be a mac of habitual veracity, he will speak the truth, and discharge his official duties, whether sworn or not Either then the oath is useless and for this reason it may well be omitted ; or it is unnecessary, and for this reason we should come to the same conclusion. Those who need to be sworn in order to make them tiuthful will not be made so thereby ; and those who are not al ready truthful do not need to be sworn. Sworn witnesses or sworn officers are not regarded as any more credible or reliable than those wno simply affirm, but decline on conscientious grounds-to take an oath. For these reasons we think that it would be better for the State to dispense with the oath altogether. and require witnesses or officers of law simply to affirm, making false testimony a penal offense and offi cial unfaithfulness a ground of im peachment. This is enough for-the state, without attempting to admin ister a religious rite. Let it punish false testimony as a crime against the State, and impeach unfaithful officers ; ana it will wield ;the only motive which, it can successfully wield in favor of truth. This we regard as legitimate and proper. It is just the sanction of truth which falls within the province of the State. The fact that the State permits per sons to affirm without being sworn is a virtual adxission that they need not be sworn at all. .The excep tional case provided for had better be the general rule. Society would not. in our judgment, lose anytuing by suspending a nsage which an swers no good end, and to which there are certainly very serious ob jections. The New York Press on the Message. The Tribune thinks tbat the prom inent features of his administration had already commanded popular ap probation, but the message will still more endear the President to the hearts of his countrymen. The writer thinks that in reference to San Domingo, the President is clear ly right in his position, if not mis informed as to the material facts and submits that Congress will be constrained by public sentiment to admit San Domingo into our Union unless it can be made to appear that her people are preponderantly ad verse to sucb a fusion. He thinks the Presidentis patience almost ex hausted by the Cuban outrages, and regrets the silence of the message in regard to the Alabama Claims and esteems the President's suggestions and recommendations with regard to public lands and land grants as wise and timely. The Herald thinks the President's message is a good state paper and a staunch party platform, and that as an exhibit of the management under his supervision of the Government in our foreign and domestic affairs there is much in it that is good and encouraging, and foreshadowing the general policy of his administration, there is nothing in it calculated to disturb the general confidence of the country . The Timet saja the message is the best answer to those who insist that the mission of the Republican party is ended, or impugn General Grant's fitness for interpreting the wishes and promoting the interests of the people, and that the policy set forth is at once positive and practical. The writer thinks it is clear that the President has no idea of plunging the nation into war as a means of manufacturing party capi tal; j et that there is nevertheless a rethcr striking suggestiveness in a brief paragraph which is devoted to the Alabama claims, and the mild nesa of the President's reference to that question renders more signifi cant the firmness of his remark in regard to the fisheries. A pleasant slip of ths tongne is recorded by a French Tjaragraphist A lad' was enjoj ing the society of her lover, wucn tne bell rang, and the servant announced the doctor. "Tell him I am ill, and cannot sec him," was the madame's reply. Dr. Hall tells this story of a man who sang most piously the hymn : 'Were the whole realm of nature mine. That were a present tar too small." and all through ,'the singing was fumbling In his pocket to mako snre of the smallest piece of silver for the contribution box.
