VOL. XX, NO. 7. WATERBURY, CONN.; WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 12, 1906. PRICE TWO CENTS. ODIOUS ACTION That Is What Vatican Terras France's Cnrailiatlon of Mgr Rlontagnint ORDERED TO ORGANIZE Rome, Dec 12. The Vatican au thorlties characterize the action of the French government , in ' having Mgr Montagnlnl. the. excelled aecre tary of the papal nunciature at Paris, accompanied to the frontier by police . as being an odious action showing a desire to Inflict humiliation on those who because of their weakness can not retaliate. Vatican circles regret Mgr jjeiia Chlesa, the assistant papal secretary of state, was not sent to Paris after the rupture of diplomatic relations, as, in view of the Fran cophile attitude he always displayed under the late Pope Leo, he was the only person capable of reaching an understanding with the French gov ernment. It Is believed even . now that notwithstanding the gravity of the situation. France would not find it difficult to conciliate the Vatican if negotiations on the subject were opened. , In the meanwhile all the Vatican forces have been mobilized to take part in the campaign. Even Father Wernz, the general of the Jesuits, has joined tnu belligerents. ' The latest Instructions sent to the French clergy are in substance that they are to look upon the situation from its worst possible aspect and organize private religious services. " Thousands of telegrams, It Is an nounced here, have boon sent 'from iree Masons, anti-clericals, republi can and liberal clubs and politicians to the French' premier, M. Clemen- eeau, and Minister of Public worship Briand. congratulating them on their energetic attitude against the vactt- ran and clericalism. On the other band the Vatican authorities have re ceived thousands of telegrams of sym- pathy and encouragement from bishops. Catholic clubs and prom! nent Catholics, Italians and foreign ers, condemning the action of . the French government.- Government Accepts. Paris.-Dec 12. The prefect of police. during the- afternoon an nouneed that the goveiament had ac cepted the application of M. Martinet, editor of the Renaissance, and Felix Robin for permission under the pub lic meetings law of lssi, to hold re llgioui meetings In all the churches, as being compliance with the . law, In other words the step taken pro vides for the legalization of Catholic services In' the churches ot Paris to morrow. ; ".' One De of Urate. ; , Paris, Dec 12. The day of grace granted to the churches of Paris in the execution of . the aw providing for the separation of church and state, postpones until to-morrow the measures for its. enforcement. The delay,' however.-has only Increased the excitement caused by the expul sion from Franc yesterday of Mgr Montagnlni. secretary of the papal nunciature at Paris. Prosecutions have been begun against the Ultramontaine abbes of the churches of St Pierre du Gros Caillou, St Augustln and St Roch, where the greatest resistance to the taking of the inventories occurred, and it baa been decided to Immediate ly take over the buildings belonging to the ecclesiastics, stop the pensions of the clergy, compel aspirant to the priesthood to fulfill their military ob ligations, and. If necessary, treat the clergy as subjects of a foreign power. This shows the spirit w'th which the government intends to meet resist ance. The reception of . Premier Clemenceau'a speech in the chamber of deputies last night also shows that he has parliament at b back. .Nev ertheless M. Cleraencea t was careful to say tbat there wis still time for the Catholics to conform with the law. That the rank and tile of the lihoinl Catholics dlaaaorove of the Intranslgeant attitude f the author! ties at Rome Is evidenced by the fact that the editor of the Renaissance, rellx Robin, has of hie own Initiative Died with Prefect of Police Leplne an application under the jmbllc meetings law of 1R81 for permission to noia ' religious meetings In tU the church a. This affords the single ray ot nope In the situation. The Figaro to day says that cardinal Kirnara. archbishop of Paris, at first declined to approve of XI. Robtn'f actio, but that later he changed his mind. This application, if accepted, no matter whether it is approved or disap proved by the clergy, will legalize the holding of religious i ices and ren der unnecessary any proceedings against parish priests or vlcara to morrow.

Starvation. rather than previous slaughter by hunters, has been responsible for the falling off of deer receipts this year. according to the veteran hunters and guides who are returning from the woods in this the last week of the open season. Deer shipments through Bangor-this season are about 1,000 below the record of 1905 and fear inn that these animals were-hln- exterminated by the hunters, there has been agitation for stricter came laws. The old hunters, ' however, claim tbat feed is scarce in, the old haunts and that the deer have gone to new grounds.

The ability of government navy yards to turn out warships equal in all respects to those built under contract In the onlulou of Bear Admiral W. L. Capps, chief of the bureau of construction of the navy, in his annual report, has. been fully demonstrated. He urges that at least one yard ou the Pacific coast ana one on the Atlantic coast, when practicable, should be given a reason able proportion of new construction work in order that such yards may al ways De available, t . Reference is made to the battleship Louisiana and Connecticut, the latter constructed in the ,New York navy yard, Admiral Capps remarking that at tne time of the delivery of the Con necticut the actual condition of Work on the vessel was practically Ideuti cal with the Louisiana so far as con cerned all matters unconnected with armor and armorment. Admiral Capps admits that it costs less to build warship by contract by reason of the snorter Hours of labor, paid holidays, etc, granted to navy yard employes but he believes nevertheless that the government should be always pre pared to turn out its own ships in times of emergency. The lack of suitable docking facill ties at Norfolk and are Island - is commented upon as being especially embarrassing to the bureau, as no bnttleshlps of any class can be dock ed at either of those yards. .. He recommends the building of . an additional dry dock, capable of dock Ing the largest vessels,, at both the Norfolk and Pensacola navy yards and that provision should be made for enlarging ana reuuuatng ury uock No 3. at the New York navy vara The appointment of a special board to consider matters relating to the personnel of the corps of natal con structors, the report says, Is in con temnlatlon. 1 Tho report describes the work upon new and old vessels' during the past year, and states tba . pellmlnary work has begun upon the design of the 20.000 ton batleship, authorized at the last session of congress. Admiral Csdps doubts tbo expend ency of repairs to warship" on for eign stations, and says tuat notn economy and efficiency will result from carrying out all large repairs and overhauling of naval vessels in nary yards within the continental limits of the United States wUcrerer practicable. : , ' . .

TOWNFIRESVEPT For tne Third Time In a Few Weeks Flames Swept Mas sachusetts Town TEN BLOCKS BURNED Wareham, Mass, Dec 12. From early evening until well into this morning the heart of this town was swept by a fire which, before It was checked, had destroyed ten buildings at a loss , roughly estimated from 175,000 to $100,000. The fire quick ly gained the upper hand and held it for over five hours, owing to the town's lack of Are lighting apparatus or waterworks, and as a last resort, after help from New Bedford, Onset, Marlon and Mattapoisett bad been driven steadily back, dynamite had to be used twice before the boun daries of the devastated district could be marked out. No lives were lost, although at first It was reported that an elderly lady. Miss Lily Washburn, was missing. Some of the homeless families managed to save the greater part of their belongings. Tho loss is partly covered jay insurance, Tbe buildings destroyed are: Bos ton Meat Supply Co's store and barn; Angus Nickerson's house; Benjamin Water's drug store and barn; Dr Charles E. Morse's bouse and barn; Dr Sawyer's house and barn; A. B. Makepiece'a house. The blaze started in a shed belong ing to the store of tbe Boston Meat Supply Co, from some unknown cause. A high wind was blowing at the time and the flames spread quick ly. Employes of the New Bedford and Onset Street Railway Co ran out their hose, but it fell short 500 feet and the additional link was borrowed from one of the hardware firm ot this city. With this coupled in the rail way company's power house pumped sea water a distance ot half a mile to the scene of tbe conflagration with but little efTect. Over Water's drug store was the telephone office, and here Operator William Nlckerson re mained at hla post summoning help from nearby places until driven from the switchboard by the smoke and flames. . A bucket brfgade helped by tbe hand tub from Marion made a gallant stand with these old-fashioned fire fighting methods. Special cars and automobiles brought many ot the New Bedford fire department to the scene, but their engine and hose and the engine from Onset arrived too late to be of service. Dynamite was brought up to de stroy Dr Sawyer's house in an effort to check the flames, but tbe attempt failed. The flames Jumped to the Makepiece house, the finest in tbe town, and tho firemen also dyna mited - this. Here the fire waa checked. . Mr Makepiece, whose house was valued at about $25,000, is one of the largest cranberry bog ownera in the state and he had many valuable papers in bis residence, but it is thought that he saved all ot them. Tbe fire district was bounded by Main and Back atreeta and the street leading up to the center of the town from the railroad stauon. Within the paat two years Ware- ham has been visited by tnree or four bad fires. Each time there baa been talk of establishing a fire de partment and buildins a water sys tem, but at the town meetings no action waa taken in thla direction. From oplnlona expressed by many of the town s most prominent cititens directly after this latest and most dis astrous conflagration. It ia believed some stens will be taken towards pro viding the place with some kind of fire protection. Tbe town nas aoout 4,000 population. Postmaster Accused. North Attleboro. Mass. Dec 12.
