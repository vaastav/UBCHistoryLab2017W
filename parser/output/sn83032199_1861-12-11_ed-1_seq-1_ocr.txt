Senate and Haute of FfHo'v-cititrnt of the Iifnrcst'ntutive.i : In the midst of unprecedented political troubles, we Lave cause or grunt gratitude toGotl for unusual good heulth urid uiott abundant hai vests. Vou w ill not bo surprised to learn, that in tlio peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound lolicitin'e, chiefly turning upon our own domestic .n-Vir. A i ix nvu portion OI tne Aiuiri-, ,.n nnnnU hn'O. durilll! the whole year. fcsen engaged in an attempt, to divide and dastroy tlio Union. A nation which endure factious do ijipstic division is exposed to disrespect abroad , and one party, if not both, is auro sooner of later, to invoke foreign inter, volition. Nations thus tempted to inter fere are not always able to resist the coun ts of seeming expediency and ungener ous ambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to bo unfortunate, and lnjuiiou to those adop ting them. The disloyal citizens cf the United Stales who have offered the ruin of our country m return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received less putionage and encourage ment than they probably expected. If u werejust to suppose, as the uisurgeuts Lave seemed to assume, that foreign na tions, in this cnae, discarding all moral, social and treaty obligations, would act KtMy and selfishly for the most speedy restoration ol commerce including espoc jally the acquisition of cotton, these na tions appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clear ly through the destruction, than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe thai foreign nations aro actuated by no higher piinci plu than this, I am quite sure a sound ar gumetit could be made to show them I lint they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebel lion than by giving encouragement to it. The principal" lever relied on by the in surgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intimated, U the e'mbarrassme tit of commerce. These nations, however, not improbably saw from the first that it was the Union which nude as well our foreign as our domestic commerce, fhey can scarcely have failed i weive that the effort for disunion produces the existing dillicuky, and that t.o iiotig nation promises more durable ntiJ a mor extensive nod rt-linbU lommeue, than can the tame nation bro ken into hostile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discussions witb( foreign States, because whatever might be their wishes, or dispositions, the integrity of our country and the stability of our (i.ivernuient mainly depend not upon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriot ism 'tnd intelligence of the American peo ple. The correspondence itself with the us ual reservations is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it will appear that we Lave practised prudence and liberality to wards foreign powers, averting causes of irritation and with firmness maintaining our own rgbts and. honor. .Since, howev er, it is apparent that here, as in every other State, foreign dangers neccssnrily attend domestic dillieulties. I recom mend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaicing the public de fences on every side. While under this general recommenda tion provision for defending our seacoajt line occurs to the mind. 1 aio, in the same connection, ask tho rttention ofCongross to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some for tifications and depots of arms and muni tions, with harbor and navigation im provements, all at well selected points upon these, would be cf groat importance to the national defence and preservation. I ask Attention to tho views of the Sec retary of War expressed :n his report up on tho same general subject. I deem il of importance that the lyal regions of Last Tennessee and Western North Caro lina should be connected with Kentucky and other fiithful parts of the Union by railroad, I therefore, recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for the construction of such road as speed ily as pos-ib'n. Kentucky, no doubt, will eo.oporatt .'id, through her Legislature, make the most judicious selection of a line. Tho Northern terminus must con nect with Bomo existing railroad, and whether tie route shall be from Lexing ton or Nicholasville to the Cumberland Han, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee I- .1 - -P T " : 1 1 - lino in tlm direction of Knoxville or on I some still different line can readily be termined. Kentucky and the General Government co-operating, the work can t0 completed in a very short time, and, when done, it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a valuable permanent improvement, with its cost, in All the future. Some treaties deiigned chiefly for the interests oi commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been ne- gotialed, and win ne submitted to the Senate for their consideration. I Although we have failed to induce some ei tne commercial powers to auopi a a j- trie Military Academy, sirable melioration of tho rigor of a mari- Ily mere omission, I presume, Congress time war. wo have removed all obstruo- has failed to provide Chaplains for hospit. lions from the way of this humane reform, als occupied by volunteers. This subject except such hs Bie merely of temporary J was brought to my notice, and I was in and accidental occurrence. duced lo dri up the form of a letter, one I invite your attention to the corres- j cony of which, properly addressed, has pondenco between Her Britannic Majes- been delivered to each of the persons, and ty's Minister, accredited to this Govern I at the dates, respectfully named, and ma nient, and the Secretary of State relative ted in a schedule uontaining also the form w me detention ol tne lintisn stip t'ann- oi tne letter t,:ener marked Aj and here Rhire in June last, by the United State with transmitted. learner Massachusetts, for a supposed j The gentlemen I understood ntered bleach of the blockade.

I f, however, it should not bd deemed advisable to carry that lecommeudaiioti into effect. 1 would suggest that authority e given investing tho principal over the proceeds of the surplus referred to in good securities, with a view to tho satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely to arie hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire. lty tho act of the ftth of August last, Congress authorized the President to in struct the Commanders of suilal le vessels to defend themselves against and cap ture pirates. This authority has been ex ercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the Eastern seas, especially, it seems to me that it would uho be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture nny prizes which pirates may mako of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the Cor. iular Courts now established by law in Eastern countries to abjudicate tho eases, in the event that this should not be ol jectea to by the local authori- ties. If any good reason exists w hy we should perseveie longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of liny ti, I am unable to dis. cover it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a charge d'affaires ucsr each of those new States; it does not admit of a doubt that impor tant commercial advantages might be se cured by favorable treaties with Iheni. The operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment, have been conducted with signal success.

It is gratifying to know (hat the expen ditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same pat riotism which has thus far sustained the Government xill continue to sustain it till peace and uuiuii shall again bless the land. I respectfully refer lo the report of the secretary of ar for information respect' ing Ihe numerical strengtn ot tne army and for recommendations, having in view ai: increase ot it ollicirncy and the well being of the various blanches of Ihe ter vice entrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the peoplu has proved equal to the occasion, and that the number ol troops tendered greatly exceeus the force which Congress author ized me to call into the iiuld. 1 refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable decree ol discipline already at de-jtained by our troops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army The recommendation of (ha Secretary for an organization ol the militia upon a uniform basis, is a subject ot vital i'npor tance lo tho future safety of the country, and is commended to the serious at ten tion ofCongross. The large addition to the regular army in connect'on with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of Cadets to the grettest capacity of peusa'ed bt tho sivtne into nt Chaplains in the Army, fin titer suggesting that gener al provision bo made lor Chaplains to serve nt hospitals as well as with regiments. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operations ol I hut branch of the service, the activity and en ergy which have characterized its admin istration, and the results of tho measures to increato its ellieieney ami power. Such have been the . d lition by construction und purchase thnl it may almost bo said a navy has been created and brought into service since our cliflicul tins commenced Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before assem bled under our Hag, have been put afloat, and performed deeds which have increas ed our naval renown. I would invite special attention to the recommendations of i ho Secretary for a more perfect organization of tho Navy, by introducing additional grades in the ser vice. The present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions submitted by the Department, will, it is believed, it adopted, obviate the uithcul ties alluded to, primote harmony, and increase the ellieieney of the Navy. There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court ; two by the decease ol Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. 1 havosofar forborne making naminations to fill these vacancies for reasons whish 1 will now stute: Two of the out-going Judges resided within the States now ovenun by revolt, so that if their success sori were appointed in the same localities, they could not now serve upon their cir cuil, and many of (ho most competent cuil, and many of tho most compe'ent . men there probably would not take the justment of claims against the Govern-pc-sonnl hazard of accepting to servo.even ! ment, especially in view of their increased here, upon tlio.

The invesl thal to transler to the North one which ' igation and adjustment of claims in their has heretofore been in Ike South, would nature belong to tho judicial department, not, with reference to territory and pop- ' l'.esi lei, it is apparent that the attention illation, be unjust.

The di pressing iullu ,ry difficult for even the best informed per- ences of the insurrection have been e.-pe-son to ascertain precisely what the f'.nlute ' chilly felt in Mm operations of Hie Talent law really is. It seems lo me, vety minor- taut that the statute laws should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may con sist with the fullness and precision of the Legislature, and the tiersnicuit v of ils hin i guage. This, well done, would, I think, greatly fucilitate ihe labors of those whoe duty it is to asi.-t in Iheadininistration of iho luws, and would be a lasting benefit , to the people by placing before them, in a more acceptable and ir telligible form, the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties. 1 am informed by some, whose opinions 1 respect, that all ihe acts of Congress now in force, and of a permanent and general nature, might be revised and rewritten, so as to be em braced in one volume, or, ot most, in two Volumes, of ordinary and convenient fixe, and I respectfully recommend (o Congress to consider on (he subject, and it my sug gestion be approved, to devise such lilau as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed. One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection, is the entire sup pression in many places of all the ordina ry means of administering eivil justice by the oflicers, in the form of existing law. This it the caso, in whole or in pari, in all the insurgent States, and as om armies ad vance upon and lake possession of parts of those Slates, the, practical evil bi conies more npparent. There tire no courts nor oflicers to whom tho citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent States, and there is a vnst amount of debt consti tuting such claims. Some hive estimated it os high as L'l K),()l )!),( Kit) due in large part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citi7ensj it ho are even now making great sacrilioe in the discharge of their patriot ic duty to support tho Government. Un der these circumstances I have been ur gently solicited to establish, by military power, courts to administer summary jus tice in such oases. 1 have thus far declin ed to do it ; not because I had any doubt that the end proposed tho collection of the debts was just and right in.itsell', but because I have been unwilling to go be yond the pressure of necessity in tho un usual exercise of power. Hut the powes of Congress, I suppose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I reler the whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent Stales and Territories I s may be under the control of this Govern ment, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order, or by tho power of our arms. This, however, is not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and tocease as soon s the ordinary courts can b re-est'tUished in peace. It is im- portant that some core convenient means should be previded, if possible, tor t lie ad . . . sources during I lie fiscal year, eiuiing o one 30, 1801, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the trans than the revenue, lor IMjO. llieexpon- uiiures weiu c io.uvu, i n. , a decrease of more than eight per cent, as computed with those of the previous year, and leaving an excess of expenditures over the retenuc for the last fi-cal year of 4,5i7,402 7'J The gross levenue for the year ending June ;uuh, lSOli, is e.-timate I at an increase of four per cent, on that of 1801, making !?S.iS:5.0t0. to which should be aided the rai ning, of the Department in carrying free matter, viz: JjOO.UUO, making

The receipts of tho Patent Otliee have declined in nine months about ?100.00i), rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary, to make il self-sustaining- The demands upon the Pension Olliee will be largely increased by t lie insurreu (ion. Numerous applications lor pensions. based upon the casualties of the present war, have olieady been made. There is reason (o believe that many who are iioit upon the pension rolls, and in receipt of the bounty of (lie Government, ore in the ranks of tie insurgent army, or giving them aid and comfoit. The Secretary of the Interior ha directed a fuspen-ion of the payment of the pensions ol such per sons open proof of Ihuir disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that olbccr to cau'io the names of such persons to Le stricken from the pension j roiis The relations of tho Government with the ladian tribe i have been greatly dis turbed by the irsurreetion, especially in .Southern Superinteiidency und in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kiiiimis is in ihe possession of inmr genls from Texas and Arkansas. Tlieiigenls of the United States Gov eminent, appointed since ihe 4th March for this mipoiintendeucy, have been unable lo reach their ptsls, while most of those who were in tho otliee before that lime, have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assume loexercise the powers ofugeuts by virtue of commissions from the insurs i cctio IlihtS. It has been stated in t lie public press that a portion of these Indiana have been organized as a military force, and are at tached to the uriny of the insurgents. Although the Government has nr official information upon this subject, letters havo been written io tho Comm'r of Indian Affair by several prominent Chiefs, giv ing assurance of their loyalty to tho Uni led Stales, ond expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops lo protect them. It js believed that upon tho repossession of tho countiy by the Federal Ibices, the Indians will readily cease all hostile dem onstrations and resume their former rela tions to the government. Agi iculture, confessedly the largest in terest ol the nation, has not a Department nor a Bureau, but a clerkship only assign ed to it in tho government. While it is. fortunate that (hi? great in terest is so independent in i:s naturo as t.) not have demanded and extorted more from the government, I respectfully ask Congress to coiisi k-r whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general udi'iinlage. Annual reports ex hibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce and manufactures, would pro sent a fund of information of great prac tical value to i lie country. While I make no suggestion as to details, 1 venture tho opinio.i that uu agricultural find statisti cal bureau might profitably be organized. Tho execution of the laws for tho sup pression of the African slave trade has been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject ot gralulation thai Ihe efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman train! have been recently attended with unusual success. Five vessels being lilted out for the slave trade have been seized and ei;n (leiuiied ; two mates of vessels engaged in the trade, and on !'""' )"in "".j vis-el as a slaver have been convicted and subjected lo the penalty of line and inis piisoument; and one captain, taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of of fence under our laws, the punishment of which is death. The Territories of Colorado, DakoU.h and Nevada, created by the last CongresR, have been organized and civil administra tion has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying, when it is considered that the loaven of treason was found existing in some of these new coun tries when the Federal oflicers arrived there, Tho abundant natural resDurces of these territories, with thu security and protec tion atloided by orgini.ed governments, will doubtless invito to them a largo im migration, when peace shall restore the lusiness of the country toils accustomed channels. 1 submit the resolutions of the Legisla ture of Colorado, which evidence the pat riotic spirit of the people of I hat Territory. So far tho authority of Ihe United States has b?er. upheld in all the Territories, ns it is hoped il will be in the future.
