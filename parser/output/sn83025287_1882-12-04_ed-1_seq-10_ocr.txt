TIIE STA ROUTE PROSECUTIONS. A Reform of the Civil Service—Postal Statistics. I Special Telegram to the Globe. Washington, Dec. —The president's message and the report of the secretary of the treasury were submitted to the cabinet at yesterday afternoon's session, and care fully considered. • The main features of both documents had been discussed at for mer meetings of the cabinet, so that yes terday's work was mainly revisory. Last night they were sent to the printer, who ■will be " held responsible f<"r their safe keeping until the time for their return for regular transmission to congress on Mon day next. This secrecy of preparation has not altogether availed in serving its pur pose, however, and there is authority for giving out , A 

SVMMABY OF THE MESSAGE, which also includes the important features of the treasury report. The message of last year covered thirty two pages of a printed pamphlet. The message of the present year will not cover more than twenty-four such pages, and it is probably a column, if not more, less in newspaper space. The president pre faces his message with a review of the more important matters which appertain to our foreign and diplomatic intercourse. He recites the fact of the passage of the immigration treaty with China, and an nounces that under the direction of the state department, arrangemests have been effected for carrying its provisions into operation. THE 

SOUTH AMERICAN TROUBLES are treated at length, and comprise a succinct review of what has been done by the government in the direction of an amicable adjustment of the pending difficult^ between the bellig erents. The mission of Mr. Trescott and Walker Blame to Peru and Chili is re called, and reference is made to the reports submitted by them, which were the subject of full discussion in congress and other wise, officially, last spring. The apparent prostration of the effort made by the gov ernment at that time in the interest of peace did not discourage further efforts in the same direction, and the appointment of Mr. Logan as -minister to the Chilian government gave assurance that the gov ernment of the United States was still desirous, so far as might be proper and acceptable, to interpose its good officers. The president ventures to hope that the apparent obstacles which have so far confronted our minister to Chili may eventually be overcome to the credit of this government and the satisfaction of the hostile powers. On the subject of the movement for an 

INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONGRESS, to assemble in Washington city inaugurat ed under the administration of his prede cessor, the president recites the fact of its interruption by his own order, and states as his reason for giving such an order, that upon careful research and earnest re flection he had been unable to reconcile the customs that have prevailed in the diplomacy of this government with a proposition so far-reaching in its scope and so doubtful in i|s effect and that, since upon congress must de volve the development and ratification of such a proceeding, he had felt it incum bent upon himself, in the interest of pub lic policy, to transmit all the correspond ence which bore upon the subject as well as the subject itself, to congress. The president does not intimate an un favorable attitude toward the assembling of such a peace congress, but prefers that if it shall assemble its character and ob ject shall have been first the subject of thoughtful consideration, and by the representatives of the people rather than by the executive head of the government. In this connection the president suggested the advisability of measures looking to a settlement of international difficulties by arbitration, which method, he recalls, has been the subject of profitable discussion, satisfying him that the object is well worthy the attention of congress as a means of securing prolonged peace. 

MEXICO. The president notifies congress that, pursuant to the confirmation by the sen ate of the special commissioners nomi nated by him, arrangements have been progressing for the commercial treaty with Mexico, and the departure of the commis sion will not be long delayed. Mention is made of several copyright and international treaties, notably with Spain and Belgium. 

AMERICANS IN SBtXISH JAILS. The president treats briefly the matter of the arrest and imprisonment of Ameri can citizens in English jails, reciting the fact of the arrest and inquiry regarding them on behalf of this government, of the demands made through the state depart ment and our minister to England for the prompt trial of the suspects or their re lease, and acknowledges the reparation subsequently accorded by the British gov ernment. The statement is supplemented by tha announcement of the transmission to congress with the message of volumin ous correspondence and other papers cov ering the subject. The president next reviews the opera tions of THE

The total net revenue was $403,525,250.28. The net expenditure decreased from $260,712, --887.59 to $257,981,440.20, a reduction of $2,731,447.39, which, added to the increase, makes $45,474,405.10 ii the surplus rev enue applicable to the reduction of the public debt. The expenditures on account of interest on the pnblic debt show a re duction of $11,431,534.39—fr0m $82,508, --741.18 in 1881 to $71,077,206.71 in 1882. The exAss of revenues over expenditures was $145,543,810.08, and the amount applied to the reduction of the debt $106,281,505.55. The amount stand ing on the books of the treasury to the credit of the disbursing officers of the United States at the close of the fiscal year was $36,067,872.48. THE POSTOFFICE DEPABTMENT. ; The receipts for the fiscal year on ac count of the postoffice department were $31,836,062.30, and the expenditures $39, --265,298.43. Of these amounts $20,211, --991.78, or about one-half, was received and expended directly by the postmaster, with out being deposited in the treasury. The unavailable funds of the treasury decreased from $29,521,632.72 to $29,517,275.32. EXPOBTS AND IMPOSTS. • The exports for the last fiscal year were $733,239,732, as against $883, --925,947 during 1881, a decrease of $150,686,216. The value of our exports of cotton was $199,812,644. The value of the exports of breadstnfe amounted to $182,970,528. The imports during the year amounted to $724,639,574. balance of trade in our favori n face of our decreased ex ports aggregated nearly $26,000,000. BEDUCTION OF TAXATION. The president congratulates the country upon its prosperity, and favors a rigid economy in public expenditures and a re duction of the internal taxes. He endorses the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury that the tax on distilled spirits, tobacco and fermented liquors be reduced to a minimum consistent with sufficient revenue to meet largely in part the ordinary demands of the government. He favors otherwise the ab olition of internal taxes, leaving spirits, tobacco and fermented liquors to bear the burden. 

BEFUNDING. A considerable portion of the message is devoted to a report of the operations con nected with the refunding of the three and a half per cent bonds into three per cents. From the fact that these latter bonds rule at a premium, the president suggests to congress that in his opinion the time is now ripe for legislation which will enable the secretary of the treasury to further con tinue to refund the debt. He thinks the experience of the year conclusively shows that the bonds of the nation bearing 3 per sent, interest can be successfully placed. He aggregates the amount of interest it will require to pay the four and four and a half if they remain outstand ing until maturity, and concludes that wise statesmanship ought to find out some means of escape from the burdens of such heavy drafts upon the treasury on account of interest. He recommends no specific plan, but if some portion of the bonds are not funded, favors a modification of the law, so that national banks may in some way have the advantage of the premium on such bonds as are held by the United States treasurer to secure their circulation. THE 

TABIFF, Touching the tariff, the president renews his recommendation of last year, that the existing laws need revision. He expresses the - hope that the labors and the report of the tariff com mission may be so enlightened as to facili tate congress in dealing with the subject. The president also renews his recommend ation for the early retirement of the silver certificates, on the ground that they form an unnecessary addition to the paper cur rency, which he thinks can be supplied in sufficient amounts to meet the demands of trade by national banks. 

GOLD CEBTIFICATES. An interesting clause of the message is levoted to the gold certificates. Of the is sue authorized by the act of July 12, 1882, $138,000,000 has been ordered printed for issue; up to Nov. 1, $21,790,000 had been ssued, and $14,827,000 are held in the faults of the several United States sub-treasures, leaving actually out standing $9,802,289. Up to Nov. 1 last there had been coined un ler the act of Feb. 28,1878, 128,329.880 standard silver dollars, of which $93,006, --382 remain in the treasury vaults, and $35^123,498 are in circulation. The presi dent favors the repeal of the law which requires a fixed coinage for each month, and recommends that it be left to the-dis cretion of the secretary of the treasury. THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM. Alluding to the national banking sys tem the president directs attention to the. fact that up to Oct 31, last, over 170 banks had been organized, vrith an authorized capital of $15,707,300, and to which there had been issued circulating notes aggrega ting over $6,000,000. The total number of I national banks is nearly 2,300. Siaco the passage ■of ths act of congress authorizing national banking associations to continue their corporate existence, more than fifty banks hive reorganized. ; Tire post onricE department. In reviewing the report of the postoffiee department, the president calls the special attention of congress to the reductions in the cost of the postal service for the last fiscal year. The star route service it is estimated, will cost, for the fiscal year, $5,500,000, which is more than $200,000 less than the cost of this service for the last fiscal year, and $1,730,000 less than the amount appropriated for the current year. Ho favors the suggestions of the postmaster general fo* 1 the establishment of a postal : savings system, and directs the attention of con gress to numerous recommendations calculated to promote efficiency and secure economy in the postal service. For the next fiscal year the receipts are estimated in round numbers at $50,000,000 and the expenses $40,000,000, an estimated excess of receipts over expenditures of {$4,000,000. ■-•'. *! THE WAE DjETABTMENT. . -■ That portion of the message which re THE SaINT 

PAUL DAILY GLOBE, MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 1882. i lates to the war department is of interest: chiefly because of the concurrence by the president with the views of the secretary touching an increase of the army and the curtailment of appropriations \ for public works. The president advises congress that of the amount appropriated in the last river and harbor bill, there remains on hand a large unexpended balance, which could not be applied during the year because of the late day at which these amounts became available. Pro ceeding on the theory that taxation is to be reduced, the president joins with the secre tary of war in the hope that congress for the next fiscal year will make no appropri ations on account of rivers and harbors, except in so far as maybe necessary to prosecute the work already begun, and for which the appropriations will have been exhausted at the end of the fiscal year. Tin: navy. The operations of the navy department are very briefly reviewed. The attention of congress is invited to the report of the board of advisors of the navy, and vari ous recommendations advanced. to promote its efficiency. The president concurs with the secretary of the navy in his recommendations for placing the navy on a better footing, both as to ships and armament. He also in dorses the recommendation that the rev enue, marine and life-saving service and coast survey be transferred from the con trol of the treasury department to the navy department, as a means of combin ing under a single head all similar ser vices. He also states that since the ad journment of congress a board has been appointed, which is now engaged in an in vestigation of the circumstances attending the loss of the Arctic steamer Jeannette Also, the appointment of a commission to inspect the various navy yards now estab lished and to report upon such as can be dispensed with without detriment to the public service. 

INDIAN AFFAIBS. The policy of the secretary of the inte rior with regard to Indian affairs meets the president's approval. He urges that such treatment of the Indians as will tend to civilize them should be encouraged, and calls attention to the firm and yet harmon izing influences which have been thrown about them during the past year, resulting in an exceptional season of freedom from turbulence. The importance of a law to allow the Indians to hold their lands in severalty is also urged on the ground that it would best tend to promote the welfare and permanent advancement of the It dians. 

POLYGAMY. The president congratulates congress upon the passage at the last session, of a law for the suppression of polygamy in the territory of Utah. The commissioners ap pointed under the law have been engaged in their labors in Utah, and have made con siderable progress. There were and remain, obstacles of no mean order to be overcome, which the president hopes may disappear without occasion for more stringent legis lation. The failure of the people of that territory to accept the law in its fall spirit ' was, he says, perhaps to have been expect ed to some extent because of the radical change in the elective system heretofore prevailing, and the natural aversion to the law of the great majority of the people of the territory. He recom mends the continuance of the commission until it shall have bean demonstrated that there is no longer practical necessity for its use. ,• 

PENSIONS. The estimates required for the payment of pensions for the current year is $100, --000,000. This is an increase over last year's estimates, accounted for by the ad judication of a greater number of claims because of the increased clerical force authorized at the last session of congress. THE STAB SOUTH PKOSECUTIONS. The president recalls the prosacution of the ; star route cases under the de ! partment of justice,' announcing the progress already made and the determination of the administra tion to secure a full investigation and a satisfactory outcome in the courts. He de clares it to be his purpose, and it is that of the department, to obtain only a just result, and one that will commend itself to intelligent and fair-minded public opinion. But the administration will not suffer obstruction at the hands of its own officials, as has been shown by removals from office as the penalty of official departures from a correct course of action. The president takes care to emphasize the infliction of these penalties as having been prompted wholly in a spirit of loyalty to the reasonable demands of the government, and he commends the action of the department of justice in this re spect, referring to the attorney general's report and correspondence transmitted from the depratment of justice. 

CIVIL SEBVICE EEFOBM. Nor does the president forget the civil service. He is still in favor of its eleva tion, and some plan which will improve it by reason of a more stable tenure. He is opposed to removals save for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance. He makes no rec ommendation as to what should be done to reform it, taking the ground that it is within the ample jurisdiction of congress. sab DBowwnre. A Lad Drowned V.'liile Trying to Save His' Krother From Death. On Friday afternoon a sad accident oc j curred on the Minnesota river near the railroad bridge opposite Fort Snelling. A number of lads were skating on the ice at that point, and while engaged in that sport became somewhat boisterous. One of the boys, named Frank Freeman, snatched the bat oil a companion, and was making oil with it in great glee when he passed the danger line arid broke through the ice. The accident was seen by his brother Reese, who was some distance away, and lao at once rushed to.the assist ance of his younger brother. . In las haste he did not observe that he was passing over dangerous ice, and before ho , was aware of his danger he broke through and was completely submerged and drowned. The attention of the crowd . was attracted entirely by the first accident,' and the breaking in of K,9ese was not discovered until it was too late. His body was re covered soon after, at the spot where the ice broke, but life was extinct. The younger brother was saved by the spec tators, among whom were several men from the fort. When the body of the unfortunate lad was taken home, his mother was completely prostrated. She is in a delicate condition, and the she • : very nea: ly killed. her. SI c has been lying moaning, without shedding a tear, ever since. Reese Freeman was a bright lad of fif teen, and universally beloved by all who knew him. 

AGREE TO DISAGREE. , The Attempted Compromise of the Rail road War at Chicago a Failure— Porter's Firmness Bursts Things—Another Meet ing: in York. : [Special Telesrram to the Globe. ! Chicago, Nov. • —The meeting of the presidents and general managers of the railroads engaged in the war in the North west, held at the office of President Keep, of the Chicago & Northwestern, failed to arrive at any agreement regarding the mat ters in controversy. President Alexander Mitchell and General Manager S. S. Mer rill, of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, were first to arrive on the scene, and a short time afterward, President Hugh Rid dle and Vice President R. R. Cable, of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific came in. Assistant President E. H. Winter, of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha, was the next to appear, but President Bax ter, of the same line, did not join the party until the hands of the clock indicated the hour or" 11, the time for which the meeting was set. Thy visitors were welcomed by Presi dent Keep and Vice President Marvin Hughitt, of the Northwestern, and after a hand shake all around the antagonists re tire I' into the president's room to endeavor ' to settle their difficulties. The conference lasted from 11 un til 1 o'clock, and when' it was'over, Presi dent Keep informed the Globe represen tative that nothing decisive had been ar rived at, and that the meeting had ad journed to meet at the Windsor hotel, New York, Dec. 8. "You may say,*' said Vice President Hughitt, "that all the subjects in dispute were discussed in good temper." It was evident from the expression of perplexity am]j dissatisfaction on .Presi dent Keep's face that the out con- of his little plan to restore peace or patch up a truce was anything but what he hid hoped it would be. In a general way it was learned that President Porter of the Omaha' line, was fixed and immovable in the position he has taken, which is that the Milwaukee & St. Paul people must relinquish the ag gressive policy of extending their line and building new roads into the territory of other roads, where such new roads are not required, before he will consent to a cessation of the present war. President Mitoaell, of the Chicago, Mil waukee & St. Paul, defends the right of his company to build new roads wherever they were wanted^ by the people, and de clined to made any concessions in this respect. President Keep, in calling the meeting, evidently thoight that the question of the division or theJNorthwestern business was the principal thing to be settled, but Presi dent Porter's statement of his position has changed the situation entirely, and the prospects of an early adjustment of the troubles are exceedingly gloomy. Messrs. Riddle and Cable, representing the Bock Island and the Minneapolis roads, were of course ready to enter a new pool, provided it was agreed that'Jtheir in terests should have an equal share of fie earnings, but the new phase of the war put the consideration of their proposition out of the question for the present. President Porter was the first to leave the meeting, and was followed by Messrs. Riddle and Cable. Messrs. Mitchell and Merrill remained in conference with Messrs. Keep and Hughitt for five or ten minutes longer. It was reported that President Perter had lost control of the Omaha line, and had taken his present attitude in order to prolong the war and depress the stock market and regain his hold on the road.
