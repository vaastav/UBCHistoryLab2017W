Roosevelt's message in a nutshell: A square deal for all and tbo big stick for the trusts and pother thieves, and some for the foreign bogie 'man. W' Ht is well that tbe Bradley and the Thaw i cases come up in the good old winter time when disinfectants are not neoded. The insurance cotnpauies in tbe state, which number about 125, are on the verge of aban doning tobacco risks in the Burley section that do not enjoy police, fire or community protection. 'i. If the American Society of Equity will keep within the law tho will have the support of Svery right thinking man in the tobacco belt. 'Tbere is no doubt but what the Society has in- J?cfea9edtho price of leaf tobacco at least $4 per hundred. That meaus at least $10,000,000 extra money in the hanil9 of the grower. If, , on the other hand, the tobacco war is controled -bv the mob spirit, .with intimidation, arson and m . ........ ........ , general anarcny, men tiie gooa wotk or years ijwill.be lost, and pricewill drop back to where they were and theie will be more sheol to play fin old Kentucky than there has been in dark; est Russia for the past twouty years. The ujjeioLcdgkr is emphatically against the Shigh-handed monopoly known as the Ameri can Tobacco Trust, but farmers, remember Ithat arson and anarchy are" even worse than monopoly Keep within the law and the law liwill protect you. All lawbreakers look alike the bar of justice. ing a sito'f&r tlie State 'Fair at Louisville. Tbe easiest way out of the trouble is to move the State Fair to Lexington, whore it should be held. Six hundred thousand retail tobacco stores in the United States is food for thought and calculated to make a body smoke up and take notice. Of this vast number It is declared that the Tobacco Trust controls only 1,000 of them. President Roosevelt has issued his regular Monday announcement, that he will not be a candidate for a third term. These bulletins will bo issued weekly from the White House and a copy sent to Wall street and another to Senator Forakkr. Catcsi 3Ums The Oklahoma Legislature The President's message "contained 30,000 has passed a "Jim Crow" car words, and was as lengthy as a piece of string or the moral law. If one were to read care fully the last message of President Roosevelt, study it and jot down all its saliont points, he would doubtless have a complete political and economic vade mecum and a statesman's guide to a perfect commonwealth. There is neces sarily a heap of tommyrot and superficiality about all such documents, and if you will measure the deficit in what he wants and what he gets, the ratio will be quite disheartening. But, nevertheless, the President's annual mes sage, although one of the firmly established customs of the Republic, and a very ocean of words, yet it could and should be boiled down to about one-fifth its usual dimensions, and it would then be too long. The annual saving in printing, handling, mailing, reading, etc., would be no little item of econbmy. But, on the other hand, it gives employment to hun dreds and it might be just as well to let Mr. Roosevelt alone. He'll do as he pleases; anyhow.
