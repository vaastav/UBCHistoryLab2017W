By special cable telegram from IddiIod, riaii-d yesler day afternoon, we learn tbat the outdoor demonstration of the trade societies in that city in support of the re form movement constituted one of the most imposing and significant political manifestations witnessed for many years, perhaps in modern times, in Great Britain. There were fifty thousand men in the line of marcfc, with hands and banners, alter the American fushion. The people were addressed from seven stands, and there were about fifty popular speakers. The Fenian element was strongly represented, and the flag of the Stars and Stripes was borne aloft to the music of the "Wearing of tho Green." When our despatch dosed the city re ma.oed quiet. Two English regiments had sailed from Liverpool for Ireland. Count Bismarck has returned to Berlin. He received a deputation from Scbleswtg-Hotstein. A private cable despatch from Paris was received in this city yesterday, which saya in effect that "no direct reply has yet been transmitted by the French govern ment to that of the United States upon the subject of the Immediate withdrawal of the troops from Mexico, or in instalments, as was proposed by M. Drouyn de l.hnys. Mr. Seward, In his despatch, has remonstrated against the neglect, aad asks for the prompt fulfilment of the promise, which was received by the United Sutra in good faith, aad In the expectation that It would be ful filled. His remonstrance, however, was wholly free from threat, though decided sod earnest in Its tone. That any difficulty will grew out of it is not believed la quartan here where the lengthy message to Mr. Bige low, so far ea ite general character is concerned, is fully known."

During the week ending last Saturday evening there were four hundred and twenty-two deaths In this city, being a largo increase over the number reported for the previous week. An interesting lecture was delivered last evening in the Chare? of the Transfiguration, Mott street, by Rev. Father Wilson, on tha subject of his travels In the Holy ljtp.1, before a very large audience. The Church of the Divine Paternity (Dr. K. H. Chopin) was dedicated to the service of God by appropriate exer cises yesterday. The building is of ample dimensions, la built of Belvilie atone and brick In the perpoadloular gothic stylo of architecture, Is handsomely finished, and is capable of seating over sixteen hundred persons. Owing to the Charter election taking place to-day, no business will be transacted in any of the courts.

They were served with an injunction while at their labors, however, and the work ceased. The December term of (he Court of General Sessions opened yesterday, and four cases were tried. James Robinson pleaded guilty to burglary in the third degree, and was sentenced to the .ling rtlng Prison for five years. George Mfer, charged with burglary, was sent to the Penitentiary for a year. John Wilson and Michael Mackin were acquitted of the charge of mealing small sums of money. The Grand Juty were discharged till the 12th inat. Tlie further hearing of the charge against James H. Greatrox of having manufactured forged notea on the Union Bank of Scotland, at Glasgow, was resumed yes terday. The evidence for the prowcution has closed. Mr. George M. Curtlss, for the derenee. submitted that no case had been made out for the extradition of the prisoner. Commissioner Newton formally adiourned the matter till Thursday. There were some thirty persons arraigned before Judge Smaliey in the United Stales Circuit Court, yesterday, on charges of uttering and passing counterfeit fractional currency and compound interest notes. Tbey pleaded not guilty, and Monday next was appointed for tbo com mencement of trial In the several cases. The stock market was buoyant yesterdav. Gold closed at 140X a 141. The amount of business transacted yesterday was limited, though the markets generally were not essen tially changed, previous prices being sustained for both foreign and domestic merchandise. Cotton was more active and a shade firmer. Coffee was dull aud nominal. On 'Change flour was quiet, lint unchanged. Wheat was dull, bat steady. Corn was in limited demand, but fully lc. higher.

They will fad it, M ?n exhibit of the working of the several Executive Departments daring the lest year, an interesting, instructive and satisfactory State paper, while upon the great issue of Southern reooaatruetion it reads like a chapter from "The World before the Deluge." Mr. Johnson devotes tiro tedious newspaper columns to a defence of his last year's measures and general ideas of Southern restoration, including some beantirul extracts from Washington's Farewell Address and from Jefferson and Jackson, in support of his theory of State rights and the powers of Congrees, and then he drops the subject. It is as argument to the court alter the jury had rendered their verdict. It may be compared to a history of France, omitting the revolution whioh over threw the Bourbons?as a trivial matter not worth mentioning in pleading their claims to the throne. It is indeed remarkable that slier deliber ately submitting his Southern policy against the plan or Congress to the people in the late elections the President should not have a word to say of the will of the people, as made manifest in these elections. He talk* of "the ancient landmarks," as if none of them had been swept away by the late Pouthern deluge of fire and blood, as if the war had changed nothing and as if the recent elections had decided nothing. In a word, Mr. Johnson for gets that we have passed through the fiery ordeal of a mighty revolution and that the pre-existing order of things is gone and can return no more?that a great work of recon struction is before ns, and that we cannot escape it. Taking it for granted, however, that this superfluous argument of the Execu tive on his exnloded policy is only an ingenions device, with his colors flying, for turning over the whole matter absolutely into the hands of Congress, where it belongs, we may dismiss this branch of the Message without further rerna rk. Passing over his summary of the depart mental reports and the recommenilutions in connection therewith, the President's brief statement of onr relations with England and France next challenges our attention. He sayB "it is a matter of regret that no consid erable advance has been made towards an adjustment" of onr difficulties with England, arising from Anglo-rebel depredations upon onr commerce during our late civil war; but be thinks the delay in this mailer may be charged "in no small degree" to I he embar rassments resulting from the late change in the British ministry; and he expects that a* the attention of the new ministry has been caller! to the subject, it ? will be now taken up and considered in a becoming uud frieudlv spirit." In regard to France, it appears that, expecting the removal or the November instal ment of the French troops from Mexico, as promised by Napoleon, our new Minister to Mexico, Mr. Campbell, with General Sherman as hia confidential adviser, was sent off on Mie 9fch of November to look up the republic, under the impression that with the exit of the first instalment of French bayonets the republic would displace the empire. It further appears, however, that on the 22d of November information whs received from France that Napoleon had decided not to withdraw his first detachment, as promised, in November, hnt to wail and withdraw the whole of bis troops in the spring. Hence the late despatches to the French government re monstrating against this nonfulfllmeot of Na poleon's pledge in the premises. No answer to this despatch, we infer, has been received. Thus, then, the matter standi. Mr. ( ampbell and General Sherman, sucking oranges, are awaiting at Havana the retirement of Maximilian with the first instalment of the French troops before venturing into Mexico, while "poor Max" is forcibly detained by Mar sha) Bin line, ami the French troops are kept In the countrv Intact for some ulterior purpose. What is it? The President hints at it in s proposition from France for "a mutual conven tion for the adjustment of all claims of citizen* nnd subjects of both countries arising ont of the recent wars on this continent." This proposition is thought not unreasonable; but it is turned over to the consideration of Congress. We conclude that Napoleon is holding his army and his man Maximilian iu Mexico in order, through some arrangement with the United Stales. to get certain claims fixed upon the re public as the price of hia trithdrtiwal of the empire. There tany be even deeper designs than this contemplated by the French Emperor. His fnrme? tnUnlf cordial* with hnglnnd. which seems to be now revived, m?y result in a common purpose between tboae two Powers to nrreaf the growing influenoe of the j United States in the British provinces, the Spanish American States, and the West India Islands; for the empire of the sess Is Involved in this American balance of power and the conflict between republican and monarchical ideas the world over. 1 his is a great subject, and next to the para mount business of .Southern reconstruction, It should command the attention of Congress. Mr. yieward. in his efforts to solve onr foreign difficulties, has signally tailed, and the admin istration falls back upon Congress. Indeed, i he gist of the Message may be summed up In the simple remark that it turns over to t-ongres* the settlemeut of onr domestic and our foreign troubles, and we ran only hope that the two bonnes will rise to the demand* ol the crisis and prove equal to the task assign ed them.

The report of the Secretary of War iaa plain, well written document, containing in as brief a apace aa practicable a compact and well ar ranged history of the business and operations of that Department during the past year. The reduction of the army has been going on aa rapidly aa circumstanoea will permit, and there haa been, of course, a corresponding retrench ment of expenditures. There are now only n little over eleven thousand volunteers, white and colored, left in the servioe; bat the Secretary reminds the conn try that, should any national emergency arise, pant experience proves that an army of the fall strength of a million of men conld he organised with all necessary swiftness. The importance of speedily providing the army with breechloading nmali arms of the best pat tern has been reoognised by the government, and experiment have proved that the Spring field rifle can be altered into a breech loader and become a better arm in all respects than the Prussian needle gun. This Is no doubt a fact, since the latter arm has been much over estimated. With these improved breech load ers the efficiency of the regular army of the United States will be much increased. The total estimate of military appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, I860, is $23,205,609. The Secretary's report is confined to the business of the Department?the expenditures of the different branches of the service, the progress of works of defence, the operation* of the Frcedmen'a Bureau and other interesting details. It is accompanied by reports from the roinmaudants of the military departments and of their subordinate officers, transmitted by General Graut, all of which contain mutter of interest. General Grant explains that the regular army, which has now almost entirely replaced the volunteer force, has been mainly employed during the past year in service along the con stantly extending frontier and in insuring the execution of the laws and protecting life and property in the lately rebellious States. Indian hostilities have, however, diminished with the expiration of thn Teltellion, and the lawless elsss si the South has heen much Bmaller than could ha ve been expected aft er a civil war of such magnitude, although sufficiently formida ble to justify the presence of a military force. General Grant snggests the abolishment of In dian agencies and the transfer of the Indian Bureau to the War Department?a policy which, we have no doubt, would be beneficial to the Indians as well as to our government. In a great many instances these agencies have been used as a means of defrauling both the red man and the white, and have lain at the foundation of most of our Indian difficulties. Lieutenant General Sherman, who has had coramsnd of the military division df the Mis souri for the past year, unites in this recom mendation to place the entire management of the Indians under the control of the military anthoi itics, and gives good reasons for such a policy. Ilis report is brief, but contains an interesting account of the measure* by which lie hopes within the next year to overcome some of the difficulties that have presented themselves in the past within bis Important division, so that the important work of the Pacific Railways and the general onward march of civilization and improvement may not suffer from the depredations of the savage. The reports of Generals Pope, Halleek. Mc Dowell and Steele relate mainly to Iodian affairs. General McDowell believes the main difficulty in the District of California to be with the whites more than the Indians, and states I hat white men ahoot and maltreat the natives with utter impunity. Here, we sub i mit, is a chance for ohr philanthropists, now that they are abont to lose the negro as su object of sympathy. General Meade makes a report of hla opera tions on the frontier in connection with the Fenian movement against Canada, and sbo ws I that bnt lor hi* prompt action our Canadian neighbors intght have witnessed the sight of more of ihelr "Queen's Own'' in the neighbor hood oF Montreal running nway from the bavonels af the terrible Fenians. | The report of Phil Sheridan is?like Phil Sheridan. It reads with all the snap and fire ot ooe ot bis cavalry raids. The surrender of the rebel commander. R. Klrby Smith, bore upon its face, be says, the evidence of double dealing. His real object was to get serurify fir the Arkansas, Lotiisiunn and Mississippi i roup* to return to their homes in safety, while the Texan*, who m.nlo a constant boast that I hey were not conquered and that they would i-eaew the fight at some faturs day, declined to surrender and returned to their homes, rie ?troying magazines on their way and carrying off the arm* and ammunition from the differ ent arsenals. Sheridan tells ns that It was the original intention of this branch of the rebel army to organize a column of fifteen thousand confederates at Marshall. Texaa, under Jeff Davis, for the invasion of Mexico. Tba cap ture of Davis spoiled this scheme. Sheridan makes no concealment of his sym; pa thy with the Mexican republicans and regard* Maximilian's Imperial rule as only the "history of the buccaneer Morgan," on an extended scale. The presence of the large Union force in Texaa and on the Rio Graude, the General believes, settled Maximilian'a business, and he advances the opinion that if a demand had been made twelve months since for the with drawal of the imperial troops on the ground that (be invasion of Mexico was a part of the rebellion, it would have been successful, and the HufTeringa of that conatry would the sooner hsvc ended. The condition of Texaa itself is not repre sented ns very promising. Pride in the rebel lion is the atnndmrd of loyalty, and the Union soldiers are in bad odor. "My own opinion," any* Sheridan, "la that the trial of a white man for the murder of a freed man, la Texas, would be a farce; sad, Hi making this statement, 1 make It because truth compels me. and for no other reason." The troubles la New Orleaae are dismissed with a brief notion, sad the General evidently looks upon Governor Well* aa a political demagogue, aaxlous to retain office by any ?Mffib During i*a anaran * fftUfc fcg wM a 1m filled vacancies in offlos through, oat the State with returned confederates, In order to advance hie own chanoee of election. "I only apeak of It now," aaye Sheridan, "bo oauee it led afterwards to bitterness and shed ding of blood, in which the military were to some extent involved." The whole report of General Sheridan will be read with interest. Major General Thomas confines himself to submitting the sub-reports of the officers in his department of the Tennessee. General Wood, from Mississippi, gives a good general account of that State, alleging that substantial justice is now administered throughout the State by the local judicial tribunals to all classes of per sons, irrespective of color or antecedent politi cal opinions. He admits, however, tbe presence of a great deal of crime and that many outrages have been suffered to pass unpunished. The labor question has of late presented a more promising attitude, since the freedmen have been taught that freedom is not licentiousness. Tbe contract system is regarded as tbe best, both for the employer and employed, although some of its details are uqjust and oppressive. The crops are almost a total failure. Reliable information goes to show that the corn grown in the State will not feed the people until the first of January, and the cotton made will not repay the cost of production. In Kentucky General Jelf C. Davis reports the only trouble is in the increasing number of "gnerillas" and "negro regulators," whose lawless sets have necessitated the more aotive interference of the military. The report of General Daniel E. Sickles on tbe Department of the South is hopeftil in its tone. There is a marked improvement in the condition of affairs, both as regards the ad ministration of justice and tbe question of free labor. Id this respeot the Depart ment Commander differs from tbe Governor of the State, whose recent message to the Legis lature was full of gloomy apprehensions and of sullen murmnrings against the attempt of the "conquerors of the South" to "further humili ate and degrade" hor people. So far as free labor is concerned, General Sickles quotes the remark of the Colonial Governor of Jamaica in 1835:?"Wherever the planters wish the thing to succeed it is successful." We have no doubt there is sound troth in this, and that the main difficulty in the way of the entire Buccess of tbe free tabor system may be foand in tbe stiff necked obstinacy and stubborn prejudices of tbe old slave-owning secessionists. There is one portion of General Sickles' re port which will be read with satisfaction. In formation has reached him that General Wade Hampton recently delivered an address before an association of rebel soldiers, in which he spoke of the government and armies of the United States in s manner well calculated to incite discontent and hostility in the minds of the people. "I have directed an inquiry into the matter," says General Sickles, " in order that the association of rebel soldiers may be suppressed and General Hampton admonished to observe th? terms of his parole." This is a good move in the right direction. Tbr h'rral Reform nrmnaiitrolion in l.nniloM Yesterday. We were not unprepared to Hod tbat the prreat John Bright reform demonstration in Loudon, yesterday, had assumed a strong democratic character, nor tbat evidences of Fenianism were discernible throughout the whole proceedings. The recent action of tlie British government in countermanding the order to send the English militia regiments to Ireland, and the evident panic which has seised upon the authorities, proves that there is quite as much danger from the Fenian movement ia England as in Ireland. Accord ing lo our special despatch from London, received by the cable last night, there were fifty thousand people in the procession yes terday, in which forty-seven trades societies and several branches of the Ketorra I<eaguo participated. Forming in St. James Park, this immense body of m?n marched through the princioal thoroughfares of the city to Beaufort House, where titty prominent leaders of the movement addressed a mam meeting from seven stands. There was no disturbance. The military were closely confined to their barracks, and no collision was possible, even if it watt desired. But the most significant point in the proceedings was tbat the Stars and Stripes of America were carried conspicuously among the banners and the people marched to the music of hands playing "the Wearing of the Green," through.Pall Mall and Piccadilly and the aristo cratic quarters of the West End. Our despatch is dated in the afternoon of yesterday, at which time the meeting was still progressing, without any symptoms of disturb anee, although the most intense excitement pervaded the entire metropolis. Upon the whole the event was regarded as the most sig nificant public demonstration which has taken place in London for many years. It may be accepted as a token of popular unity and popu lar discontent of a most menacing character to the government. Tut fimwi ok John H. Sciuutt?Oca Latk Spk< iai. Ovspatch rami I tour. It a|> poers from a despatch received at the State Department, Washington, on Sunday night last, and dated the same day at Alexandria in Egypt, and from Mr. Hale. United States Con sul General in that quarter, that he had "ar rested John H. Snrratt, one of President Lin coln's assassins." and that thers was "no doubt of identity." From this official information and the Roman correspondence published to day, our late special despatch from Rome, announcing the detection of Snrratt as a sol dier in the Pope's Zonaves. hia arrest in ths Pontifical States aad escape, is confirmed; fbr we conclnde that, finding Italy too hot to bold him, Snrratt tost no time in escaping in some fishing smack or trading vessel to Egypt. We waited witk confidence, as in regard to the meteoric shower in England, the confirmation ol this special despatch from Rome, and it has arrived, as did ths csiestlal attestation, in due time. As fbr the wretched Snrratt. he will probably be brought back to the United Stales in one of our vessels of war of the Mediterranean squadron by orders from Wsah ington.

In another part of the paper we toy before our readers the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury to Congress. Making up the books of any great entabllshment is very Interesting matter to tboae oonoerned, and there certainly never was a period in our history when an exhibit of our national finan cial condition and prospects excited greater interest than now. The facts presented by the Secretary are highly gratifying. The figures show that wo are prosperous beyond every preeedent and .11 calculations. The receipts from aU the or dinsrv sources, of revenue, Independent of loans, for the fiscal year ending June 8^ IMC, were five hundred and fttty-eight millions. For the quarter ending September 30, 1866, the amount was nne hundred and fifty-eight millions. The actual Income exceeded too estimates for the first three quarters of this year, beginning in January and ending in June, over ninety millions, and for the follow ing quarters in a greater proportion. Mr. McCulloch had no Idea, and perhaps few had, of the stupendous resources of the country. The expenditures were two hundred mil lions less than estimated for the fiscal year. The enormous estimate of over three hundred millions was made for the War Department before peace was lully restored and while the hulk of our armies were in s-rvlce. The De partment has expended only about one hun dred and nineteen millions, which makes nearly the difference of two hundred millions between the estimates and actual expenditures. The balance in the Treasury on October 1 ol this year was one hundred and forty-two mil lions. , , . The public debt on June 30, 1865, less cash in the Treasury, was $2,681,000,000. June 30, 1866, it was $2,650,000,000 ; showing a net de cline of $31,000,000 for the year. Bnt font months after, that Is, on October 31, 1866. the debt was $2,551,000,000, showing a decrease dar ing these tour months of $99,000,000. With the present vast income of the government the debt would necessarily continue to decrease mora rapidly, because nearly all of the claims fot war expenses have been paid. But the feecre tarv says, "It la not expected, nor Is it desire hie", perhaps, that the same rate ot reduction should be continued." He proposes to diminish the internal taxes and a modification of the tariff, which will re duce the duties on importations, lie thinks the tariff should be so revised as to remove the burdens on industry, and especially on thai which weighs upon the production of raw materials. He is decidedly opposed to taxing raw materials. The amount of revenue ha wants is only enough for an economical ad ministration ot the government and for redoc^ log gradually the principal of the national debt. He thinks four or five millions s month should he applied in extinguishing the debt But he says there must he economy, and, abovs all. there must be no additional donations to railroads and other companies. "The debt," be urges, "can and should be psid by the gene ration that created it" He wisely maintains that "a national debt is a burden and a ae vere atrain on republican institutions." He proposes to issue twenty years' five pes cent bonds, psyable in England or Germany, to absorb the six per cents now held in Europe. This is very well as fsr as It goes j but it would be much better to consolidate the whole debt into five per cents and for a longer period. This would render the debt uniform and less expensive, ss wall ss more simple to manage. The longer period would give a greater value in the transformation of ons mock lor another, and would not prevent the government buying the debt up at any time with its sinking fuud. Some of there views are sound enough ; bul when Mr. McCulloch gets on bla old bobby of forcing specie payment* be sbow^thai in this respect hp is a man of one idea. He re grets that Gongreas did not give him more power to contract the currency. He has done all he could by withdrawing legal tendets, bul the Increase of the nstionsl bank currency has kept the amount of circulation much as it wa* when lie made his last report. He regards "? rednndaut legal tender currency as the prime cause of our financial difficulties." What finan cial difficulties ? Where are they? Are they tonnd in his overflowing Treasury or in the (^universal prospenty and active industry of the country? They are nowhere but in his im agination. The truth is Mr. MoOnlloch appears to be incapable of learning "Uker from the actual condition of things or the lessons ol history. He says *p?cie payments ought to he resumed and could be by tbc first day of July, 1868, and he hopes the legislation of Congress will be such as to bring it about earlier. There are no financial difficulties now. nor are there likely to be under our present gradually pro gressive movement toward specie payments: but if an attempt should be made to carry out bia theory the whole country would be plunged into revulsion and bankruptcy. strongly as we object to this part of the Sec retary's report, there are other portions whleh oall for commendation. Some of these we have referred to; but we cannot slose our remark* without expressing the hope that Congress may act upon thin recommendation to pan* l"w tor the government of our mercantile so that such s disaster as that of the Kv*n Star may not occur again.
