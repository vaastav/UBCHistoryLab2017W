Fitz- Tsimmons, United States Marshal for ijeorgia.

Baxter, United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit; E. A. Hoyt, Commissioner of Indian Affairs; Henry S. Sanford, Minister to Belgium, and H. W. .Hilliard, Minis ter to Brazil. The nomination of Gen. Harlan, to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, was confirmed. It is stated that the President has indicated his determination to renominate all per sons whose nominations fell at the ex piration of the special session, except sucn as were shown by inquiry in the Senate not to have as clear records as public officers should have. Mr. Hendricks lias been "interview ed in reference to the reports recently published, that Mr. Tilden took the oath of office last year, and would soon begin a contest for the Presidency. Mr. Hendricks says of this : "I know noth ing whatever about these statements. Of course I can not know Mr. Tilden's actions, what he has been doing, or what he intends to do. So far as I am concerned, Mr. Wheeler has been sworn into the office of Vice-President, and he may stay there for four years. When he was sworn in that ended it." Mr. Crittenden, of Missouri, has introduced in the House a bill for -the appointment of four Commissions on the improvement of riven one on the Upper Mississippi, one on the Lower Mississippi, one on the Missouri, and one on the Ohio.

The country between Bismarck and Deadwood is reported to be overrun with predatory Indians, and many dep redations and murders arc reported ftamrwiiipaiiagrornie"Bereuin cavalry from Fort Lincoln, besides an addition al force of infantry from other stations, have been ordered to Deadwood. The War Department is informed that these hostiles are largely com posed of Spotted Tail's and Red Cloud's followers, some of whom were recently on to Washington. It is not considered unlikely that we may have upon our hands ' this winter a general war with the Sioux. It is said that the House Committee on Elections, as a result of their delib erations on the Colorado case, at first agreed, 7 to, 4, to "report in favor of a new election. Party pressure on both sides was brought to bear, however, with the effect of bringing all the Dem ocrats to agree in favor of Patterson, and all the Republicans, with one ex ception, in favor of Belford. Gen. Cox, of Ohio, stood out in favor of a new election, and so reported. Ex-Gov. Pinchback, of Louisiana, has addressed an open letter to Gov.

The amount of deposits held by the, German Savings, as shown by an official statement made on the 5th, is $352,572, and the number of de positors is about 2,200. As the larger portion of these are the poorer classes, mainly German laborers, me chanics and shopkeepers, the failure will undoubtedly be productive of much suffering, as, even if the bank ultimately pays nearly,or .quite in full, depositors will necessarily lie kept out of their money for some months.

Turkish advices of the 4th were to the ef fect that a Bussian attack on Kamarli had been repulsed with great loss to the assail ants. The Turks also claimed to have se cured decided advantages in a fight near Tirnova, in which the Bussian loss was esti mated at 3,000. Their own losses were not stated. This news came from Constantino ple direct. Turkish official dispatches of the 5th state that Suleiman Pasha has captured Hgana, with 11 guns, 20 ammunition-wagons, and MO prisoners. A Constantinople dispatch of the Cth says: One Turkish di ision has crossed the Lorn, taken Popkol, and is marching in the direc tion of Verboca. Another Turkish division is only three hours' march from Tirnoa. The Russians admit the capture of Iizana. and acknowledge heavy losses, after a stub born resistance. Dispatches of the th state that Suleiman Pasha is making strenuous efforts to relict e Plevna, and hopes to force the withdrawal of enough Bussian troops to enable Osman evacuated Batoum, and the fall of Erzcroum is daily looked for, as reinforce ments can not now reach Hukhtar Pasha.

The Turkish commander attempted to break through in the direction of Widdln, but was attacked in front and rear, and was com pelled to lay down his arms after a glorious struggle.

WUKUIIW, oiiu UlUUt feel any of the dreadful aches and pains which sometimes distressed her so. For a week, Jack' wondered and mused within himself how he could get something for Christmas presents for his little sisters. "He couldn't make any thing at home without their seeing it, nor ai scnooi without the teacher's see ing it, or else the big boys plaguing him about it. Besides he would rather buy something pretty, such as they had never seen before china dolls in nink dresses, or" something of that kind. One morning, however, Jack discovered sfraw-stack, and he no longer wondered about ways and means, but in a mo ment was awake to the importance of this discovery. That very, evening he made a wooden trap, and the next morning early set it near the stack, and laid an inviting train of wheat quite up to it, and scattered a little inside. He told his sisters, Mary and Janey, about the trap, but not about what he meant to do with the quails when he caught them. . That afternoon Jack went to his trap, and to his .unbounded joy found an imprisoned quail, frozen quite stiff. He quickly set the trap again, and ran to the house with hi-j bird. All that evening he worked at quail-traps and made three more. It was so much warmer that their mother let the children stay up a little later than usual ; and Mary ventured to bring out her playthings and Janey's. There were two ddlls.some bits of broken-dishes, and a few little pine blocks. Mary watched hef. mother's face until she was sure she was "feeling good," before she ventured to begin to play, because on days when mother was very discouraged, it made her feel worse if the children were noisy, and so they would keep quiet and speak in whis pers. "Does Santa Claus bring dolls?" asked Mary, suddenly, of Jack. "Ohyes; dolls with pretty dresses on; and little bunnits and pink shoes ; and little cubberds to keep their clothes in, and chairs, and every thing," said Jack, enthusiastically. "Oh, my!" sighed Mary, as she look ed dolefully at their poor little heap of toys. Reader, their dolls were cobs, with square pieces of calico tied around them for dresses; and after hearing what Jack said, it wasn't so much fun play ing, and the liltle girls soon went to bed. After they were asleep, Mrs.Boyd said, reproachfully: "'Jack, I wish you wouldn't say any thing more about Christmas to the chil dren." " Why, is it bad?" asked Jack, so as tonished that he stopped whittling. "No, of course not; but you're get ting their heads full of notions about fine things they never can have." Jack's eyes twinkled. "Oh, but you don't understand, mother," said he; "maybeSanty Claus will come this Tear." His mother shook her head. ."You know I caught one quail to day?" whispered Jack. 1 ? " Well ! " said his mother. "Well, I'm going to save 'em all the week, and Saturday take 'em to the meat-man in the village. I guess he'll buy 'em. I heard that quails were fetching two cents apiece. And I'm go ing to get enough money to buy the girls something nice, and you must make 'em hang up their stockings, mother, and then we'll put the things in after they get asleep." His mother smiled quite cheerfully. "Well," said she, "do the best you can." Their father was away that evening." He was generally away evenings be-: cause most of the neighbors had cozier firesides than his, besides apples, and sometimes cider; and so he passed many a pleasant hour in gossip and farm-talk, while his own little family shivered gloomily at home. By Saturday morning Jack had 10 quads. The four trap3 had not been as fruitful as they ought to have been, perhaps,' but this was doing very well, and he trudged joyfully to town with his game hanging on a stick over his shoulder. The meat-man did, indeed, give, two cgnts apiece for quails, and be Even -the groceries had Christmas tovs and.. Christmas trees. A good 'many boys and girls stood around the store windows pointing out &ehing8 they most admired, " Md1!!!' what Santa Claus would bring them. Jack had 15 emails, whfoh hmncrlif fc'm in cents; so he was now the owner of half a dollar, which was more tnonnv than I he had ever possessed in all his life be fore. But when, two dolls were bought, and they weren't very fine dolls either. there were only 20 cents left. Jackrdtcf mean to buy something for his mother too, but he had to give that up, and after looking over the bright-colored toy books in the show-case he selected two little primers, one with a pink cover and one with a blue one, and with a big ache in his throat, parted with his last ten cents for candy. How very, very umo uo wit uuyiug aner an, ana not one thing for his dear mother who had sat up till two o'clock the night before, mending his ragged clothes for him. Jack's heart was very heavy as he walked out of the gay store with such a little package, but it sank still lower when his father's tall form loomed im suddenly before him risrht in front of tne uoor. "What you doing here?" he asked, sternly. "Been buyin' a few things," said Jack. "Let me see 'em,' said his father. Jack tremblingly opened his package. "Where 'd vou set the moniir? "With quails," said Jack, meekly. His father fumbled overtho thimra with his big mittened hand, and said quite gently: "For the girls, I s'pore." " les, sir," answered Jack, beginning to feel relieved. ' Well , run along home.' ' Jack was only too happy to do so. There wasn't much sympathy between him and his father, nor. indeed, between his father and any of the family that is, there didn't seem to bo: but 1 sruess the stream was frozen over, and only need- eu a igw gleams oi sunsnine to make it bubble on, laughing and gurgling as in the best of hearts. "Jack related his adventures to his mother in whispers, and hid the Christ mas articles in the wash-boiler until such time as they should bo wanted for certain small stockings. He told his mother how sorry he was . not to have a present for her, and that Iittlo speech went a lone . .. . . o way towara niaKing her nappy. That night she sat up I wouldn't dare tell you how late making cookies some thing that hadn't been in the house be fore that winter. She cut them out in all manner of shap.es thnr. fYminin in. not forgetting a bird for Janey, with a remarkably plump bill, and a little- girl for Mary, with the toes turned out. bhc also made some balls of brown sugar (the Boyds never thought ot such a lnxury a3 white sugar), to make believe candy, for she didn't know Jack had bought any candy. Nowl amgoingto tell what Mr. Boyd did after he met Jack by the toy-store. He had gone to the village to have a "good time." That didn't mean, as it docs with some men, to get tipsy; but it meant ho was going to Munger's gro cery, where he could meet people, and talk and joke, and keep warm. Mr. Bovd had been chopping wood for a farmer, and had received his pay; but instead of going dutiiuiiy home ana consulting with his wife about what he should buy, he was going to "look around" and see what Munger had. He was touched at tho sight of Jack's poor little package of gifts, but I doubt if it would have made much impression on his mind if somebody hadn't walked in to Munger's and asked in a brisk, loud voice: "Got any Brazil nuts, Munger?" The man with the brisk voice bought T don't know how manv ouarts of Bra zil nuts, and walnuts, and filberts, and almonds, with all the loungers looking on, very much interested in the specta cle. Then he bought raisins, and candy, and oranges, Mr. Munger growing more smiling every minute. " Going to keep Christmas, I guess," said he, rubbing his hands together. "That I am; 'Christmas comes but once a year,' and there are little folks up 'at our house who've been looking for it with all their eyes for a fortnight." Then he bought a bushel of apples, and, filling a peck measure with them, passed them around among the men who sat or stood about the stove. "Take 'em home to your little folks if you don't want 'em," he said, when any one nesitatea. There were three or four apples apiece, and Mr. Boyd- put all in his pockets, with a slight feeling of Christ mas warmth beginning to thaw his heart. After this cheery purchaser had gone, some one asked: --Who is that chap?" " He's the new Superintendent of the Orphant Asylum," answered Mr. Mun ger, rubbing his hands again; "and a mighty nice man he is, too. Fays for all them things out of his own pocket. Very fond of children. Always likes to see 'em happy." There were two or three men around that stove who hung their heads, and Mr. Boyd was one of them. He hung his the lowest, perhaps because he had the longest neck. I don't know what the other men did something good and pleasant, I hope but Mr. Boyd thought and thought. Jbirst be thought how the " orphants " were go ing to have a brighter and merrier Christmas than his own children who had both father and mother. Then he thought about sweet, patient little Janey, and auiet Mary, and generous Jack, who had taken so much pains to give pleasure to his sisters, and a great rush of shame filled his heart. Now, when Mr. Boyd was once thoroughly aroused, he-was alive through the whole of his long frame. He thumped his knee with his nst, men arose ana wamea to tne counter, where he dealt out rapid orders to the astonished grocer for nuts, candies and oranges ; not in such large quanti ties, to be sure, as the "orphants" friend had done, bat generous enough for three children. And he bought a calico dress for his wife, a pair of shoes for each of tne little gins, ana a cap lor Jack. That store-contained every thing. from grind-stones to slate-pencils, and from whale-oil to peppermint-drops. These, purchases, together with some needful groceries, took all Mr. Boyd's money, except a few pennies, hut a Christmas don't-care feeling pervaded his being, and he borrowed a barr. intn which he stowed his goods, and set oat lornome. It was a pretty heavy bagful, but its heaviness only made Mr. Sard's heart the lighter. When he reached home,he stood the bag np in one corner as if it neia runups, ana said, " Don't meddle with that, children.". Then- he went out and snent the rest of the ahnrt day in chopping wood, which was very cheering to his wife. So manv Sundays had dawned with just wood enough to cook breakfast, that Mrs. Boyd began to dread that dav par ticularly, for ner husband was almost sure to go right away after breakfast and spend the whole day at the neigh bors' houses, while his own familvshir- ered around a half-empty stove. Mr. Bovd said never a word about the bag, and the unsuspecting household thought it contained corn or some other uiuuieresting vegeiaoie, ana jpaia little attention to it.

Her eyes were so full of tears that there seemed to be about eight pairs of shoes, tens bags, and half a dozen Mr. Boyds; but she managed to lay hands on the real one, and him she embraced fervently. Then she brought out the cookies and sugar-balls she had made, and said to her husband, in a very shame-faced way: "See my poor presents; I didn't know the children would have anything nice, and I made these. 1 guess l won't put 'em in their stockings though, now." But Mr. Boyd insisted on their going in with the other things, and I think they were prized by the children a little more dearly, if such a thing conld be possible, than those which they called their "boughten" presents.

And this was only the begin ning of good days for that family, for, somehow, the Christmas feeling seemed to last through all the year with Mr. Boyd, and through many other years; and the little ball set rolling by Jack, with his quail-traps, grew to be a mighty globe of happiness for the whole family.

The little animal was caught in a trap about six weeksv ago, and trans- lerrett to a miniature squirrel cage wuu a revolving cylinder. The family soon became interested in tho actions of the mouse, which was nearly always sing- incr. the notes being somewhut similar to those of a bird. It continues this singing while exercising on its wheel, of which it is very fond, and especially while eating or when pleased in any way. Generally the notes are low, but at times the singing is loud enough to be heard all through the house.
