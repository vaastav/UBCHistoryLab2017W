" Till' : Irish envoys pause in the middle of their American tour to turn sad faces back to Ireland , where they now return. But whether to assume the leadership fit their party , or to stand back In the Bluulow of I'arnell's disapproval , they know not. Tun popular democratic notion , that the Alllnnco movement has arisen largely out of the opposition to soctiou- nlism , is entirely erroneous. It rostson fleopor grounds , for which certain ele ments that flourish equally in the demo cratic and republican parties are respon sible. A vast amount of philosophical Ignorance has boon aired about the Al liance. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ SKNATOR MAxmutso : ? does not claim to bo much of an Indian lighter , but his suggestion that the redskin bo deprived of his lleot pony nud furnished with oxen Instead has considerable merit. The senator's Idea is that this change of boasts will gradually turn the warrior into n farmer , and the sword Into a pruning lieok.- Considering the general worthlossncbs of senatorial philosophy on Indian civilization , the suggestion of the Nebraska senator la realty quite luminous. t.OOKINO FOll CAUSES. It ij well that the congress ol the United Stated has given prompt atten tion to Iho Indian troubles with n dis position to Inquire into their causes. The discussion In the senate on Wednes day ought to have great results. On tbo authority of General Miles , one pctmtor ascrlbo'l the demonstrations of the In dians wholly to starvation , and declared it wns a crime on the part of the gov ernment to stand by and do nothing but furnish arms to the whites. Another sunator , the chairman of the committee on Indian alTalrs , expressed n doubt that shortness of food was the origin of the trouble , or that a good supply of food would bo n euro for it. Flo intl- mated that a constant change in the policy of the Indian service was in some measure responsible for the revolt. The rations required by treaties had been cut down year by year , by way of starving the Indians into soil-support. This senator admitted that tlio Indians had just cause of complaint because of the non-fulfilment of agreements made with them by the government. A third senator stated from personal observa tion that tlio Indians generally are well fed , and ho thought the trouble with them is that being fed nnd clothed and allowed to live on the bounty of the gov ernment makes thorn mischievous. The weight of these senatorial opinions Is that the government has not boon doing its full duty by its wards ; it has not kept its obligations with them. Tno inspector general of the divi sion of Iho Missouri , who wns sent to the scone of the disturbance to investigate the matter of food supply , has returned , nnd his testimony must bo regarded us entitled to full conlldenco. lie saya the principal cause of trouble is the lack of rations , principally of meat. The supply of meat issued for the Pine Ridge reser vation has been reduced within a year 1,000,000 pounds , and this is not all. The cattle driven out to the Indians do not weigh moro than two-thirds what they are represented to , but the Indians lose the difference. Is it at all surprising that they are dissatisfied with thisV The inspector general does not ex pect a winter campaign , hut he says that so long as the Indians are not properly fed there will be the probability of trouble. His testi mony sustains the opinion of General Brooke , expressed within two or three days after his arrival at the scene ol the demonstration , and loaves little doubt that hunger was the chief in centive to the rebellious spirit mani fested by the Indians. The interior department has gene tc the extent of its authority in an effort to remove thin cause of complaint , and vury likely good olTocts will follow. It may bo necessary to do moro in the same direction , for which congress must make provision. Senator Dawes may bo right in the view that an additional supply ol food would not bo a euro for the trouble , but the wisdom of trying the expedient will hardly bo questioned. AltaOMRNTS FOll STSAMSlIfPS. The president , the secretary of the treasury , and the postmaster general have all submitted to congress argu ments in favor of developing steamship linos. Bills for this purpose , providing subsidies , have passed the senate and are now in the house. It is understood that the friends of those measures out side of congress are thoroughly organ ized to bring to bear all the pressure possible for their passage through the house , and if they are passed it is not doubted they would receive the ap proval ot the president. When the strength of the influence in favor of this legislation is considered it is apparent that there is serious probability of its adoption by the present congress. It will bo Interesting to refer tc the arguments offei-ed. The presidonl says that reciprocity will bo largely lim ited nnd its benefits retarded and ciimin ishod'if provision is not contemporane ously made to encourage the establish ment of first class steamship communi cation between our ports and the ports of such nations as may moot our over tures for enlarged commercial ox- changes. Ho suggests as the first condi tion of foreign trade the steamship car ; ryiug the mails statedly and frequontlj and offering to passengers a comforta ble , safe and speedy transit. The secretary tary of the treasury regards the facl that the percentage of imports and experts - ports carried in American vessels during the past year was less than in anj year since the formation of the government as appealing nliko t ( our national pride and our national in terosts. Ho regards it as both a follj and n danger to depend upon our com potilors for the moans of access to for eign markets , while "the humiliation o : witnessing tlio disappearance of oui flag from the high seas , without one effort fort to restore it to its former proud po sition , cannot bo expressed. " The secretary tary reasons that aid tto our morchnnl marine is not aid to u class , but to tlu farmer , the manufacturer , nnd the merchant chant , as well as to the ship builder uni ship owner. The postmaster general h equally earnest in favor of the countrj having its own moans of ocean trnnspor tatlon. Ho says the count'-y shouli not bo subject to foreign capital ists for moans to distribute its mall. Unexpected differences witl foreign steamship companies might at any moment cut oil mall intercourse with Europe \indor the present circum stances. Besides , the foreign mail ser vice yields a profit of not far from two millions of dollars per annum , whicli Hum , the postmaster general thinks might bo fairly considered for disposal In the encouragement of American ship ping for American mails. The force and cogency of these nrgu raonts , not now presented for the firs time , will bo universally conceded" , Tlu fact that foreign ship owners got fron this country between one and two rail lions of dollars annually , the largos part of which would l > n kept at homi and distributed among our own poopli If the country posbosscd the moan : of transportation for its foreign commerce morco , is one that challenges sorioiii con tom plat ion. It Is an ontirolv sount and unassailable proposition that i great commercial nation like the United States ought to have its owi merchant marine carrying its Hag int ( every sou and into the ports ol all na tlons with which it has * trade. But It may be possible to obtain this at too great n cost , not merely in money , but in the sacrifice of a principle important tct bo maintained in a government ot tills character. The proposition that subsidies to steamships would not bo class legislation cannot bo successfully defended , and besides this objection is the no loss serious ono that the policy would impose obligations upon the treasury the extent of which could not bo estimated with any dogrco of certainty and the end of which could not bo flxod nor foreseen. The measure providing for mail contracts with [ \inorlcnn-bullt steamships , although in volving the subsidy principle , would per haps bo accepted by the people. There is very great force In the view that the country should not bo subject to foreign capitalists for means to distribute its mail. Besides , the provision of this measure that the steamships shall bo so constructed as to bo available for gov ernment use as auxiliaries to the navy , If an exigency should arise requiring their employment , commends It to favor. But popular sentiment is strongly op posed to the other measure , known as the tonnage subsidy hill , and Its onact- moat into law would bo n great mistake. l I'llKrOSTfiltOUS MKASUItR. Homy Cabot Lodge , the father of the "forco hill , " has promptly como forward at this session with another measure of far-reaching importance. Ho proposes to deal with immigration by u now and novel method , and to make illiteracy a bar to the privileges of American citi zenship. Mr. Lodge's scheme is to turn our con- snlnp agents Into an army of foreign Inspectors specters and to admit no immigrant who Uoes not bear a passport from thorn. He would make them the moans of enforcing the severest restrictions upon immigra tion over imposed by our government and attempt to stop all undesirable ele ments buforo they had sot sail for Amer ica. ica.Mr. Mr. Lodge may readily bo credited with an ambition to perform high pub lic service , but there is neither demand nor excuse for his now bill. Present laws exclude every class of foreigners whom wo do not welcome and they accomplish it by very simple and sensible methods. They provide that .iO contract labor , paupers , criminals or diseased persons shall bo admitted to our ports * , and they make the steamship companies responsi ble for the enforcement of the law , under penaltyof returning without pay any immigrants refused admittance by cus toms ollleinls. This law embodies the spirit of American institutions on the subject of immigration. Wo have neither right nor object in refusing to receive into our citizenship any able- bodied and sound-minded man who desires - sires to como hero to improve his con dition. The proposition to inako illit eracy a bar to immigration is utterly foolish. It Would place a stern limit on the coining of foreigners , and would alter the entire character of our historic hospitality to all mankind. There are also serious defects in Mr. Lodge's plain to make use of the consuls as judges of what constitutes good ma terial for citizenship. Our consuls are not , us a rule , fitted for such important service , which would require the best intelligence and finest discrimination. Nor would it ba practicable to under take any such examination in foreign ports. It is safe to predict an early interment of Mr. Lodge's bill to abolish the in alienable right of man to seek his homo wherever ho may under the broad canopy of honvon , limited only by his duty not to interfere with the rights of others. THE PltESTDEXT AXD 

TIIE WKST. The western people have close nnd ex tensive relations with the na tional gov ernment. And what they ask of a chief executive , above all else , is honesty and promptness in tbo discharge of their public business and vigilant and thought ful attention to the development of their resources. Judged by these standards , President Harrison's administration has been eminently' satisfactory. It has been notable for the sound business in stinct which is his prominent charactor- ibtic as an administrator. The message well illustrates the atti tude of the present administration toward the west , both in its record of things done and in Its suggestions for future legislation. When it is examined with especial i-oforonco to the subject it is soon that the president has good reason to bo satisfied with the results of his work in this section. The public land question was never before in bettor shape. Under Secre tary Noble the domain open to settle ment has boon increased over fit teen million acres by new treaties with the Indians. Settlers nnd homesteaders have never had bettor reason to bo pleased with Commissioner GrotT's con duct of-the land ollico. Cases have boon pushed through with unprecedented promptness and legal questions decided with a strict regard to the rights of honest settlors. These are precisely the conditions calculated to encourage the filling up of our vacant lands by a desir able class of citizens. In connection with statehood they have given a * mar velous impulse to the growth of Wash ington and the Dakotas. The Rooky mountain region has strong reasons of its own for remembering the first half ol President Harrison's term. By his approval Wyoming , Idaho and Montana have joined the ranks of the sovereign states. The passage of the silver bill , for which his administration is responsi ble , has lent an impetus to their mines and quickened their general prosperity. Under his vigorous application of the laws tlio Mormon power in Utah has grown feeble and uttered its first cry of surrender in regard to the doutrlno of polygamy. The department of agriculture ha ? bo- coma an established institution and one of great usefulness. It constantly seeks to improve the conditions of farming and is therefore becoming an important fac tor in the prosperity of the west. It has done much to protect the reputation of American moat products abroad , unit Its watchful attention to the volume of ag ricultural exports Is worth much to our farming interests. If to this rec ord of usefulness is nddod the erovynins. achievement of reciprocity , the producers of the west will liuvo cause to put tho/presont administration higher in thoir'stoom tlmnnny previous ono. ono.No No portion of the president's mossnpo Is moro gratlfyWjj to the west thnn his emphatic deelaSition In favor of govern ment nssistnncein } { preparing the way for great systems of irrigation. He would limit the work of the government to making surveys , ascertaining the lo cation and extent"of the water supply and taking possession of It In the Inter est of settlors. TAJid this Is all that is nsked. Prlvnto clipltal and co-operative enterprise will do the work when the federal government has demonstrated whore irrigation will bo an assured suc cess and whore it will bo n hazardous experiment. Great good may bo ex pected from the president's earnest sug gestion on this subject. The west has benefited much from the sound and sensible methods which char acterize the entire administration o : President Harrison. The organ of the defunct combine as sorts that If the now council makes as good a record as the old gang It will have done well If the new council does not radically Improve the present management of citj nlTnirs , wo shall have several largo politi cal funerals a year hence , It will not bo a question of ono ward Every voter In the city will have n voici in the selection of the next nine council men. Even if a remnant of the preson t'ang succeeds in manipulating a cltj convention , they will discover that tlu voters as a whole cannot bo bulldozoc into supporting any member who prostitutes titutos the interests of the people foi selfish ends. If the nlno members at largo an anxious to succeed themselves , the' should lose no time in disinfecting them selves of the odors of the combine , fin the sinecures , conduct the affairs ot the city as they would their own business and avoid the notorious scandals , favor itisms and jobbery , which have been thi conspicuous features of the combim regime.

Lot the oillco seek th man. / TUB most pathetic feature of the present ont council situation Is the efforts of th' ' combine toolS to convince the demo cratic majority that they wore no forninst them on election day. Even tin ardent supporters of the major nt thi primaries and at the polls have disco\ orcd that they are "good enough dome crats to hold the job. " The sinecure are now as heretofore for anybody an everybody if their grip on the troasur is not ; disturbed. THE Hon. Dick Burdish is too modes by half. The fact that a majority of hi political associates are anxious to pre side over the destinies of the corainj council should not deter him from entering toring the lists. It will not detract fror the abilities of others to say that Rich nrd's masterly handling of a policeman' ' club would enable him to sbino rosploi : dent behind a gayol. . Tun awakening was a trifle rude , bu under the circumstances it was ncces sary to convince the Council Bluff council that it takes two parties to mak a bargain. _ Now that Mayor Gushing has a part majority in the council wo shall presently ontly see whether ho will insist on "busl ness methods in city affairs.

A bill was Intro duced by Mr. Laird providing that the stnto should bo permitted to locate the lands any- wharo within the stixto , but his dc.ith pre vented any action behnr taken upon the meas ure. Subsequently the proposition was pushed by Senator Manderson , who laid a brief of the case before Land Commissioner Qroft and a reply was made to tbo effect that the location of the lands must be In the eastern district , where there nro not now any lands subject to entry. Senator Teller in the early part of this congress introduced a bill amending sections 2275 nnd 2Ur ot tUo revised statutes , provid ing for the selection ot lands for education-it purposes so as to permit states to locate them in districts within their border. Colorado Is In the same condition ns Nebraska. The hill was passed by the senate May a lust and was favorably reported to the house on June U , where It now rests upon the calendar. It Is expected that the members of the house from Nebraska will immediately rnovo to have the bill acted upon. An amendment will bo offered to the bill , providing that If desirable lands cannot bo found in u statolt may receive cash payment from the govern ment at the rate of'SlO nn acre. TAHirP IJUJNDUIH IIA1ID TO COUUKCT. It looks very much ns If the republicans would have difllculty in correcting the two serious blunders in the tariff bill , namely the omission of the par.igraph nbout the rebate upon tobacco and the violation of tlio Hawaiian treaty without reopening the en tire tariff question. Kveryono agrees tint thcso two corrections must bo made , and there nro imperative reasons why they should ho rnado nt once , but the best parlia mentarians on both sides of the house hold thnt ns soon ns any such correction of the tariff bill comes before the committed of the whole house It rcopons the Hood gates of any amount ot amendments. In short , the rebate on tobacco and the Hawaiian treaty cannot pass without offering a chauco for tin plate nnd a thousand aud ono other amendments. A largo tobacco delegation Is here from every part of the country. They appre ciate that this dlfllculty is before them , and held a * meeting at 4 o'clock this afternoon to devise some means to overcome it. Mr. Samuel Baiter of the tobacco house of SpaulUhiR & Mcrritt of ChiL-aRO was especially commissioned to no- jiotiaUj with. Representative Taylor and per suade him to withhold his tin plate amend ment , which ho has been keeping back in order to sccuro a favorahlo chance to present it. Other tobbaceo men were assigned to labor with other congressmen who have amendments to offer anil intend to press them when the tobacco rebate is proposed. "I ilon't see how wo can help reopening the whole subject , " said Mr. Mills this after noon , "much ns I want to help tliotobacco men. Wo would have no trouble in the corn- mittco on ways nud means in respect to the tobacco rebate amendment and tUo Ilawilan treaty , but the trounlo will como after the bill comes up before the houso. If ono amendment Is proposed it will ho possible to olTor other amend ments without sending them to the committee , aud tucro are a number of ambi tious democrats who wish to make records who cannot bo restrained from attacking the bill with other amendments as soon as an op portunity is presented. " Hepresentatlvo McMillan , who is , next to Mr. Mills , the most active democrat on tlio ways and means committee , takes the same view. "Tho precedent was lonj. ; ago estab lished , " ho said , "that If a tariff act was amended in any particular it might bo amended in all particulars , and any attempt to correct the tobacco section will reopen the entire schedule. There are only two ways to get around It. The conimittu oil rules can adopt a now rule to fit the case or they might pass the amendment on suspension day If they could get two-thirds of the house to vote for it , but some such unusual course will have to bo adopted to get the amendments through. " Mr. McKlnley today introduced the amend ment to correct tbo bill so far as the Hawaiian treaty is concerned. Ho also recognized the necessity of inserting the tobacco rebate , for the tobacco men say that their trade is being jeopardised nnd they cannot do any business until the error is corrected. sunn FOU i > iiouaitTsuFPF.ncits , Senator Paddock has reported favorably from his committee aud will propose to make It an amendment to the regular agricultural appropriation hill the resolution of Senator Ingalls and Senator Manderaon providing that seeds shall bo distributed by the ngri- culturnl department to the drought sufferers in Kansas and Nebraska. The- making of this resolution an amendment to thu regular appropriation bill will insure its success. Senator Manderson today received this reply to bis letter to Secretary Husk asking if uny thing could bo dona for the drought sufferers in Nebraska : "In reply to yours of tholstinst. concerning the distress among the farmers of your stuto and asking for sug gestions looking to their relief through thin department. I can only say that beyond tlio regular quota of seeds thnt will bo allotted to the senators and members from your state nnd distributed and such other miscellaneous distribution from the portion of seeds re quired bv law to ho distributed by the de partment nothing ran bo done without special legislation. It would not bo In ac-cordadco with the spirit of the present law to inako in creased distribution In some sections of the country from the department's quota of seeds for miscellaneous distribution over the whole country. " 

SCHEMES ron SUITLINO ixnuxrnoum.Fs , Secretary Proctor today presented the out lines of a novel olan for determining the causa of the present Indian trouble and preventing similar dlQlculties in the future. ' 1'ho ' secre tary made an argument before the house com mittee on military affairs and proposed the increase of the maximum strength of the nnny to Its former quota of ! ! 0,000 men of all arms. If this is done , he &nld , no would Im mediately enlist two full regiments of Indians , nil for the full term of three years , and all to bo treated in every tcspect like the whlto soldiers. The Indian force would consist of both Infantry nnd artillery. The secretary thinks thu enlistment of Indians would have n very good ettVct upon thorn and their kind , us It would bring them closer to clvillznttoji mid teach them business which it now seems impossible to Inculcate. Thu routine of mili tary llfo would bo ugruoablo to the In dians , and it Is believed by tha war department oftldnls that thcro would bo croat rivalry among the Indians to bo en listed. Only the host Indians would bo selected - lected by the military authorities , and this would put them on thulr good holmvlor unit set a premium on loyalty and fidelity to the whites.

TIUKD TO MARK rouTinn CXHTAI , . There was a warm discussion lit the senate for aomo tlmo today over the Indian question In general. The democrats tried to give the situation n political turn nnd throw the re sponsibility upon the administration , insist ing that the dissatisfaction on tbo part of Iho Sioux and threatened outbreak. was the natu ral outgrowth of nilsnmtmgrmcnt. Senator Voorhccs said them was n lot of stealing among the ngonts nnd these who distribute the rations and that the dlfilculty wna duo to honest tmm ImvliiR been turned out of ollico to glvo republicans places. Senator Toiler , who Li probably better acquainted with the affairs of Indians than any other man In the scnuto , having been secretary of the Interior , acknowledged thnt there might bo Irregulari ties among some of these who distribute ra tions to the Indians , but snld the itrnllniM could bo nothing moro than lHcoiiscquciitl.il nnd that the system now employed was the ono maintained by Mr. Cleveland during the hist administra tion nud , which had borne the scrutiny of democratic statesmen nud politicians for many years. The result of the discussion was the adoption of the resolution providing for the Issuance of arms to the citizens of Nebraska , North nnd South Dakota and Wyoming. IAXD DECISIONS.

The serious turn that thoillncss of Admiral Porter has taken In the post week makes it improbable that the marrl.-igo of his daughter , Miss Kllcn , to Mr. C. II. Campbell will bo surrounded by as brilliant features as the couple had anticipated. The Invitations for the wedding on the Ifith of this mouth were sent out a week ago. The event is to culmi nate nn engagement or nt least ton years standing. No couple In Washington has over ns stoutly dolled parental objection nnd cer tainly no wedding can bo attended by as satislled n company us lins neon bidden to witness tl Is. Mr. Campbell's attentions to the daughter of Admiral Porter began when ho was a captain In tlio nriny. Ho has since been retired and for several years past lias been a valued attache of the depart ment of state. From the very llrst , while his suit wns favorably re garded by the ladv of his choice , it was violently opposed by Admiral nnd Mrs. Porter. Miss Porter bus , however , never wavered nn Instant in her determination to marry Mr. Campbell when she could nianneo to get her father's consent. For ten years Mr. Campbell has never entered the Porter mansion , because ono day Mrs. Porter had said that if she over found him in her parlor aho would leave the room. The courtship has therefore been almost nn object of public property. Everybody in the west end has watched the devoted lovers every afternoon , rain or shine , out together for a promenade. Mr. Campbell's custom was to call at tlio door for his lady love , and as she was al ways waiting ho had scnrcclv over to ring the bell. Mr. Campbell lately fell heir to some money , and this Justified him in asking his fiance to imuio the day. When the subject was broach to Admiral Porter It met with. the usual storm of objection , but ho yielded at last and the long-looked for consent was won. Chairman Dorscy of the house committee on banking nud currency and Mr. Sherman of thosouato 11 nan co committee are answer ing Inquiries on the point to the effect tha they do not hope for tUo adoption of their bill giving national banks circulation to the full parvaluoof the bonds deposited and induc ing to $1,000 for each hank the required cir culation , in view of the fight that is being made made against the proposition. Colonel Charles A. Dukor of South Dakota was nmontr the president's callers today. Thp commission of John K. Dramond of Brooking , S.

Watson Pickcrell , special agent of the bureau of animal industry of the agricultural department , loft for Now York today. Ho will bo in Omaha ou next Tuesday and then go to his homo in Beatrice. Senator Paddock intends to strengthen his bill to create n permanent tariff commission , lutroduccd by him today , by the addition of anew now section empowering the commission to adjust apparent inequities , incongruities , etc. , of the now law with the sanction of the nrcsl- dent , thus qualifying the provisions of the now law. IIo believes that if the president may lawfully ndjust duties , as provided in the reciprocity provisions of the act , no may on the same theory nuthoriro adjustments of the character proposed In the now section In dicated. The preliminary draft of the bill was sentenced today to bring the general subject before the senate at the earliest possi ble moment. First Lieutenant Francis E. Eltonhead has boon designated by the secretary of war as n member of the examining hoard for the lire- motion of oflicers , to incot at Fort Leaven- worth , Kati.

Judge Caldwell announced that ho would hear arguments In the case ot Fit/Rornhl against tlio Missouri I'ncllh In ch.imlors , The petition in the case covers llfty-two liases of closely written typewriter copy. It sots up that the Fltzgcrald-Mallory construc tion company Is Incorporated uiulcr the laws of IownwUh a capital stock of $1,500,000 .Tho stockholders are Jay UouUl , Sidney Dillon , Itusscll Sago , QcorgOiT. Oouiil , Morton , Hllss , t Co. , S. 11. Mullory anil John FiUgonild. The Gould contingent hold A controlling In terest , nud Fitzgerald nnd Military hold 115,000 In stock. The construction company contracted to hulld a road across Kansas from Its eastern tolls western boundary for the DcnvcrMem- phis & Atlantic railway company , for which it wns to receive $10,000 per mlle In stock.nml $10,000 per mlle In first mortgage loans. These securities wore afterwards turned over to the Missouri Pacltle railway company In return for promises of $1IOOU per mile of Missouri Pacllli ) S per cent bonds. The construction company afterwards con tracted to construct 11 ro.ul from I'uoblo to the state line between Kansas and Col orado , This wns to bo paid for In Missouri Pacific bonds at thorato of Sl'J.OOO nor mile , thn construction company to have the right to locate stations and , towns tmtl retain uny protlts arising therefrom. It Is alleged that tlio railway company falsely represented that I s bonds wro worth $1.05 , and agreed to deliver the bonds ns each ton miles \voro completed. Tlio company re fused to deliver the bonds as agreed and It Is claimed this was n part of a ichomo to harass and oppress Iho construction company. It Is alsonllcgcil that the stock of "tho con struction company should not bo assessed for moro than ! )0 ) per cunt , but not withstand ing this the Missouri i'liclllo directors , who held u majority of the stock of tlio construc tion company , made calls to the full amount of the stock , 1'Mtzgcrald's ' share of the assess ment amounting to Sii",000 , wtilcU wns paid with money advanced by Jay Gould und Sage. Afterwards .lay Gould offered $1.20 for tlio stock and tbo plaintiff being in flnaii- ci.il distress solil $75,000 woith of his stock to Gould. The plaintiff further alleges that in Novem ber , 18M ) , ISO mill's of road were completed nnd ready to bo turned over to the Missouri Pacific. Gould \\oi\t \ over the road unit re ported thnt it was not complete and on his recommendation tlio thrco stockholders , Gould , Dillon and Sage , voted to allow the construction company only $10,000 per mile for the first 150 ini'los , Instead of fll.OOO per mile , as per contract. The engineer of the Missouri Pacific afterwards went over the liuo and approved Itniid the railroad company has been operating it over since. It is charged that George Gould and SIICD conspired with Jay Gould and agreed to extend the ro.id from Stafford to Lnrued a distance of thirty-six miles , for f 10.000 per mile , which was at a great loss. The road was built and was afteiwards turned over to the Missouri Pacific company , the two Goulds and Sugi receiving Jl'J.OOO . per milo for the road. This transaction , together with the previous ono , It Is claimed , netted the Goulds .and Sago $1SI,000 ! , , which they pocketed. i'lio petition goes on In this strain for sev eral pages , charging the railroad magnate with squeezing ids victims and opponents by controlling the stock market and soiling bonds to stockholders for ! N ) cents when the bonds were repicscntcd us being worth $ l.tr ) > , and many otlfer tiunsuctlous ol a similar na ture. The roads contracted to bo built by the construction company weio completed and turned over to the Missouri Paclllc December 15,1887 , and on the piomlso of the New York parties to pay in a fo\v days , Fitzgerald paid debts duo the sub-contractors from the con struction company amounting to $ M,000. IIo afterwards brought suit ugalnst the construc tion for this amount and recovered Judgment in full In the United States court In this city which was alllrmcd by the suprpmrj court. / The case now pending , it Is claimed , was referred ton referee without the knowledge of FitegeiMld or his attorneys , and the rof- erco has made n loport linding for the Mis souri Pacific In the sum of SlbO.UOO. The case is a complicated ono and several A days will probably bo consumed in the hearing. Judge Caldwcll handed down a decision yesterday In the case of John S. Baker ct al against Samuel J. IIowcll ot al , a suit founded on a promissory note for $ J,000 , brought against the makers mid endorsers. The plaintiffs rolled on a claim of $ .1.50 us notary's fees for protesting the note to bring the amount sued for above the amount of $3.000. The court held tliattho question for deci sion , was , "are the notary's fees to bo treated as costs within the meaning of that word in the act of congress , or as an Independent sub- & tan two debt , wtilch may boused to inoreaso the sum of 'tho matter In dispute.1" These fees were found to ho those of a pul > - Ho ofllcial which tire iixed l > y law. Numerous authorities were quoted to show this. The . court held that these fees were uo part of \\\o \ \ \ debt sued for , and were "no such part of the 'matter in dispute' as to give the court jurisdiction by increasing the amount involved. " "On a question of jurisdiction the court has no discretion but to give effect to tlio net of congress without liberality of Intcndment or construction.
