Tho witness repeatedly refused to answer the question, o- ns ho termed It lo discuss tho mat ter' under Inquiry, At ono time ho appealed to the court for prolcrtlou against tbo maimci of the crooA examination.

Gniteau's shrewdness In dctcctlm? end anticipating any point which might bo mado ugatnst him was n marked feature of the Inves tigation. Judce Porter pressed him very closely to lecturo on theology and to sell Inspired volume of his own authorship, and which be said was one of the finest literary productions that ever cmnnantcd from an Inspired pen. "I am sorry to contradict you," Interposed the prisoner, "b it I never said so." Witness had several conversations with him.

Storrs, of Chicago, was placed on the stand. Ho had seen prisoner sev ral times at the Ke pu oilcan Committee roonm during tho cam paign. His Impression was that Oulteau had an Illy-balanced mind. Upon cross-cxamlua- tiou Storrs said ho never saw nuythlng In Gul tcau to Indicate he could not ulstlnmilsh be tween ncui ami wronir, or in.it no uiu not Know tho dlfferenco between guilt or Innocence, or that ho would not be responsible for crime. ocoYiuo noteu several exceptions to mo rul ings of Judge Cox In favor of the admission of thee" icplles. Tbo cvldcuco created quite n stir In t tic court room and seemed to stagger hoso about tho defense table. The sister of tho prisoner was particularly affected and in tones distinctly caught by reporters said, "Ho has perjured lilmsclf. that In all there is about It juiwara muicis testiucd ne tnougut uuiteau crazy. Scovlllc mado a sensation by summoning David uavis, cpeaKer itanuau, auu (senator uayanl, none of whom responded, nllhoutih thev had uccu suuptcnacil.

It was finally brought out that Kuiley had been given f.juu. Tho prisoner was worked up considerably, ami ho contradicted and accused him of perpe trating a fraud upon blm. When an extract from one of tho papers was read, referring to tho reported bargaining ot John Davenport In New York, concerning tho Marjhalshlp, Gultcau saldi "That shows how weak Garfield was and how determined hXi was to crush tho stalwarts. Bailey denied emphatically that ho represent ed himself to Guttcau as a II raid correspond tnt or tricked him In any way.

The Lord Injects the spirit tnto and then lets mnn use his own ludrement to work It out. That Is Just my ca6c. That Is tho way 1 tret tnv Inspiration." DavlYlge then put a hypothetical case, using a term like "a common, vulgar criminal." Guttcau turned toDavldgo nnd with lmmcno THE XLVJUh CONOitES superiority saldl "Thero Is nothing vulgar about this caso; It's all blgh-toncd." (Laugh ter.) Ho was quickly suppressed by tbo court. Guttcau suddenly Interrupted the examination, and despite Scovllle's efforts to restrain hhn, brokoout Ina severe denunciation of his late wife, and saying ho had Just noticed a discourse from her which was full of misstatements, nnd that if she camolnto court to testify against him he would show her up. He railed for somo minutes but flnallyqulctcd down. Witness was about to bcillsmlF'ecl when Gul tcau dctatm d t im -Jul said Willi an air of great scrloiisuesi: "Doctor, I want to ask you, who, c herldltary nimbus of tho brain exists wont a man show It wherever there Iscausel" Wltucs responded In the alllrmativc.

Witness was asked what ho thought of the speech, "Gaifleld vs. Hancock," and re plied that ho thought It a ridiculous and dis jointed niralr. Oulteau was murh Incensed nnd shouted out, "Well, It wasn't anything of the kind. You don't know what you're talking about. My speech received the endorsement of tho best men of tho country." Witness said the prisoner seemed a perfect nuisance about the rooms Gultcau retorted! "You wero auulsaucc yourself) I'd rather be hung as a man than acquitted as a fool, nnd I won't have any morn of this kind of evidence." Witness said: "He was a laughing stock as far as he could see." Oulteau became enraged, and turned to Sco vlllo and said : "If you put any moro of those cranky fellows on tbo stand, I'll squaro you again.

Dr. Theodore Fisher, of Boston, would dislike to be confined to the statement of the facts con tained in the hypothetical question, but If com pelled to answer, ho would say that he should judge the prisoner to ho Insane.

At Gulteau's trial to day, Speaker Randall appeared, but said h't could not understand why bo was subpa-naed.

Ho excused Randall till Wcducsday. Oulteau said bo wanted some of the experts to decide whether It was lusano to be Impelled bv tho Deltv to an lusano act.

Ho based Gulteau's insanity on nn hereditary taint, impairment of Judgment, and Inspiration, which also Included motive. Of course when a man committed' a crime under a delusion, and then acted precisely as a crimi nal would do, it would be presumption to bring evidence of lusnnlty, Dr. Samuel Worcester, of Salem, Mass., de clined to express an oplulou uutll tho counsel explained moro definitely his meaning of tho term "inspirational." uuiieua lunpavicunv; "u)t iii i'i'"' bird that comes among us in tho spring to spend tho six months with us gets its board, of some kind,from our fields, gardens, etc. They aro all moro or less injurious and all moro or less beneficial, and tho latter under all circumstances, fully 'or moro than com pensate for the former.

Tho blackbird (gracklo) is especially disliked, but tho hostility to it is no better founded than against the crow and many other birds.

Tho young of thoso birds, which wero at this timo fully on tho wing, had been hatched and were then roosting on tho promises of two or three gcntlu nion nearly a mile off, whore all birds aro protected against gunners or other wise, and wo have yet to hear for the first time that they desiro to gct rid of their guests. On a visit once to tho residence of ono of theso gentlemen, while sitting upon his piazza towards ovcning,we saw no less than fivo wild young rabbits running fearlessly over tho lawn. Knowing that thoy would tmaw young trees when the snow interfered with gotting thoir necessary supply of food, wo inquired whether thoy wore not destructive at such times. "Not at all," was tho response. ''Ihrougliout tho winter thoy aro regularly fed offal vege tables and hay; and. in November and .December, when they become fat, most ot them aro trapped and consumed. Tho robins,catbirds, etc, devoured 0. considerable proportion of thoir straw berries, ehorrics, grapes, oto., and tho several varieties of sparrows cat somo seeds, in season,but thoy wero regarded as friends rathor than enemies. Observ ing farmers, and otheis of cxporionco, who pay propor attention to theso things, seldom differ in opinion. Germantown Telegrajrfi.

I believe you, ns a Ixnly nnd ns uiuiviuu is, win give mo a neniiy support. 1 promise to devoto myself faithfully nud assidu ously to tho work before me. I Invoke yours and the country's charitable Judgment on all my official acts. I will strivo to be Just to all regardless of party or section. Where party principle la involved I will be found to bo u Republican, but In all other respects I hope to be able to act free from party bias. It is a singular fact tnat at this most prosperous time of our Nation's history no party In either branch of Congress has an absolute majority, and it Is therefore peculiarly fortunate that ai no other time slncoand for many years prior to the accession of Abraham Lincoln to tho exec utive chair has thero been so few unsettled vital questions of a National character In relation to which the party Hues have been closely drawn. Tho national Piospcrltv Is In advance of uuv other period In the history of our government. Violence of party splilt has subsided In n great measure nnd many of tho reasons for Its existence aro gone, while tho uulverpal tendency of tho pco plots to sustain and continue tit build un thu unparalleled Prosperity. It f-honld he our high est aim tt iiennatiently promote nud not cripple It. This Congress should be, aud I profoundly hope It will bo marked peculiarly ns a business Congress. It may bo that additional law aro necesary to give to every citizen complete protection 111 the cxerclsu ot all polit ical rights. W Itli evenly balanced wrty power with few grounds for party strife, aL with no Impending Presidential election to detract us from purely legislative duties.

In tho spring of 18S0 eight yom g Rteors wero purchased for tho experi mental farm of tho Illinois Industrial University. Two wero full-blooded Ayrhiro, two Ecvcn-eights Devon, two one-half Hereford tho dams being mmon" cows ono a full-blooded and ono about thrco quarters Short horn. They wore in ordinary condition, tho younger Hereford nnd the grade Sliort-horn being, in best flesh. Thoy wero counted fair specimens of tho dif ferent breeds, oxeopt tho older Hero ford, which was small for his ago, and not of especially good form. It was proposed to comparo tho dif ferent breeds under ordinary treatment, rather than to sccuro largest develop ment. May tho 1, 18S0, ono of each breed numbers 1,2. -land G of table was placed iu jmsturo with other cattlo, until October 1, when they wero turned into a corn-stalk fiold. Tho other four weio kept in a small pasture, which proved quito poor during n part of the sutmndr, having also corn each day. They wero placed with tho others in October, nnu all wero wintered 111 an open yard, with unthrcshed oats, much injured Irom lodging nnd rains, thrcsl ed timothy straw, corn-stalks and a very lttlo corn at the last. 1 rom 31 ay 1 thoy were all on pasture timothy, blue-grass nnd clover with full feed ot Micllcu corn, averaging about 2UU pounds per day for Iho eight head, un til tsoptctuocr 1; alter tuts thoy wero fed new corn in tho ear, about ouc-hulf bushel ench per day. Irom July until cool weather they wero on pasturo only at night, having shelter during tho day m a rather dark shed. Tucro was so vcre drouth both summers, especially in 1831, tho pasturo became very short. The winter was a trying ono on stock exposed to tlio storms and mud. In August ono Ayrslnro steer mot with an accident nnu had to bo killed. November, ! tbo rcuiaining scven wero shipped to the Chicago tut stock show, where they were slaughtered Novem ber VZ. The accompanying table gives tho ages, weights at different times, and re suits of tlio slaughter test. Tho homo weights nro "full weights;" thoso at slaughter nro alter being without lood or water about eighteen hours. A com mittee of butchers examined tho car cass nnd their judgment is given in col uutn "Quality ef Carcass." somo order as tho proportion of "Im proved, blood" in tho different animal,-, Singularly enough, tho carcass pro nounced best haci, relatively, tho light est hind quarters. This steer was tho favorito of almost nil who saw tho cat tlo when nlivo. Tho steer with largest porccntngo of tallow was placed last in merit of carcass; the next to him in tallow wero placed' first nnd second in merit of carcass.

Tho Cincinnati Pnca Current says- tho now packing season is hardly enough advanced to render comparative- figures thusarof much value.' Nearly all points show a lighter number of hogs than last yoar. At that timo thero -was a widely prevailing holief that tho, futuro of prices was towards lower fig ores, and farmers wero freo sellers. Tho condition of stock also was favora blo, and tho month of Novembor last year was exceptionally largo in number of hogs marketed. This season thero seems to bo about as much eagerness to sell, but tbis is moro tho result of a boliof in tho futuro high prices of corn. It it is not unlikely that tho courso of ovents in tho latter part of tlio sum mer season hns led to a closer "top ping" out of the stock, and that thero is relatively a smaller number of hogs in marketable condition, compared with samo timo last year. Prices of hogs aro now about $1.30 per hundred lbs, gross higher than then, which makes tho product cost about -Jo per'lb. more Last winter's packing wus nearly up to tho preceeding winter, aud for tho twelvo months now closed is 520,000 less than for tho preceding twelvo months. Tho present winter may show somo falling off in tho number of hogs, but it would bo unwiso to count upon an aggrcgato supply for the ensuing year as less than the past year. It was a significant fact that tho severity of last winter cut short tlio number of young pigs, and now wo nro led to ex pect a mild and favorablo season, in ad dition to which is tho extra inducement of higher prospective prices for stook, which will fully balanco tho advanced cost of feed material.
