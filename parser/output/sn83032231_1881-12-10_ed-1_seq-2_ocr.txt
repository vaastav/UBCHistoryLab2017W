Of course he had the assistance of heads of departments j but yet his own hand is visible throughout the message. Our relations with Hie powors of Europe are, in. this review, all satisfactory. Our Hebrew fellow cilliem will bo glad to know thit energetic remonstrances have been ad dressed to Russia concerning tho treatment of those of them who may visit that empire. Our Protestant fellow citizens will be pleased to know that steps have been taken lose our the better protection nf American mis aionaries in 'the Turkish empire. Our Cer man-born citizens tvill be happy to know that there is an end of complaint respecting the treatment of those of them who visit the German empire. Our Swissfellow cill zens will rejoice to know of the protest against Iho1mpnrtation ol Swiss criminals j nnd our Spanish fellow citizens will be sat Isficd to learn that the Spanish Government is doing its duty icspecting tlio awards ol the Claims Commission. With the, powers of North and Smith America, also, our Government is on be ctming terms. Wo have, promoted com' mercial Intercourse with Mexico, pievented a rupture betwien Mexico nnd Guatemala, taken an interest in the .boundary arbitra tion between Cosln Rica nnd Colombia, sent a special envoy to promote ienie between Chill, Bolivia and Peru, maintained warm friendship witli Venezuela, and aided in es' Ublishing the boundary ol l'itn;onin.

It is wonderful news that Ja pan is about to establish a fully cnnstitulton ul government, the Emperor having already euminowil a Congress lor that purine; tnd the President recommends the return to-.Tu- pan nnd'Cliina nf tho indemnity fund now. iu our hands. Having thus touched upon (he Govern ments of the. world, President Arthurreach es its waters, and recommends the adoption. otlha new 'CiKje'of 'ntei national yules for ,,tbe prevention jif.collisions on the high seas. Reaching our domestic business, President Arthur olleis an elaborate discussion of questions in finance and revenue. The Treasury is in a satisfactory condition, slid the surplus of the present fiscal year is esti mated at $.130,000,000, which is by' far the largest surplus since the year 1617. when it was three millions higher. The recom uieudatians of the; Secretary nTlne Treasury lespeetlng tho retirement of silver certifi cates unci the limitation of silver coinage are sustained by the President. It is estimated that the entire debt of the country can be paid In ten years; but, in view of the pres ent heavy taxation, the President holds that the revenue might wisely be reduced, even it the payment nf the debt be delayed, and he therefore advises the abolition of all In ternal revenue faxos, except those ,up.n to bacco and 1 Icoholic liquors, nnd the revision erthe tariff laws. These important ques tions of public economy will doubtless be fully debated in the present Congress. The President holds that the strength of the army should.bo increased to 30,000 en listed men, that tho navy should be "tlion ougly rehabilitated," that the fortifications and roast defences should be improved, and that the efficiency of our torpedo system should be increased by strengthening the engineer battalion. Thn rinslnl service 1 growing iu efficiency, and the attention of Congress Is again invited to postal savings banks: the Piesident, in referring to the Star route businets, calls for the vigorous prosecution of those guilty of fraud. Legis lative action is needed upon the Indian question, which the President thinks is now iu the way of being finally solved. It is the duty of Congress and tho Executive to array against the barbarous system nf polygamy nil the power which they can wield. The Government should sustain the work of education, and such aid lor its promotion as can be constitutionally atTorded should be given. Claims for pensions under the Ar rears act have lately been very heavy, and the President would slve the Commissioner of Pensions such additional assistance as is Deeded for their speedy settlement. There Is a Ion,; passage of the message in which tha President discusses civil service reform, end offers his views upon its various fea tures. The decline of our merchant marine is deplorable, and tho President would give to our navigation interests that kind of old and protection which has teen bestowed ujn our manufactures. The President elo.es his message with some remarks upon the question recently before the country of Presidential inability, tu which he hoirs Congress will speedily give consideration. Sub-Trutsurer HillUonse, of New York, lias resigned Iris position to nccej t the presidency of a new Trut company, which has been organizid wKu a capital of 41,000,000, It is rumored im tho beat possible authority, that Juilg - 1'ulger will cot re main long at the bind of the TrcaNtiry Department, but will succeed Judge Hunt on the Supreme Court liencli atau ently day. No "better choice could be made from among all the ltepublicatis of ! our acquaintance. J 11, 1 go Folger'U an able jurist and an bon at man. Mr. Joseph Warren Keiftr, of Ohio was Monday elected Speaker of the House f lUpnseuta'tivrs. lie Is -probably, ,-.js the New York Bra, the lightest weight ever promoted to so hcavj a place. Even old Mr. Petiiiiuetnu.of New Jersey, tut (!'estc'' htntecinau than Keiftr; jet heal ay bad to cou'ult the page "bo stood about hU desk when questions of parliamentary law required a prompt de cision.

While the debt (statement for Novem ber shows that the reduction of the pnb Iio debt, less cash iu the Treasury, was, daring the month, Id round numbers, $7.2GO,000, tho nctnnl reduction! of the debt won only $3,167,000, the word debt there including alt classes of obligations. The reduction of the. bonds debt wan $5 600,000 This inclu'defi the interest-bear; ing dibt,and the matured debt on which interest has censo'd. The .reduction of the Interest-benriuR debt was only $2, 400,000. A comparison of the statement issued December 1st with that Issued on the i st of July. shows that sthcelue be pinning of the fiscal year the reduction of the interest-bearing deblbas betn over S75.000.000. This is an average of over $15,000,000 per mouth. The reduction of the total debt, including all classes of obligations nnd leas cash in the Treas ury, faas been a little over $02,000,000 since the beginning of the fiscal yar, or An average of over $12,000,000 per month. This is an unprecedented record in the financial bi-itoryof tho country. It is improbable that It will be repeated dar ing the remaining months of tbo current fUcal year, with the exerption of that part of the record relating to the interest-bearing bonds. Secretary Folger can undoubtedly redeem $75,000,000 of bonds between now and ctrt July, provided that he adopts the policy of drawing heavily upon the Treasury r. sir re. But if he should depend rpon the surplus revenues the redemption will fall far short of $75,000,000. Borne time before, the end ot the lineal year there will be nn ex traordiuary expenditure of $20,000,000 for pension dencicneies. Arthur Lefroy, tlio English mnrJer er, who took the life of a Icllow passenger ou n riilwny train not many months ago, paid the penalty of his crime on Tuesday of last week. lie murdered Mr. Gold, a retired xtock broker, for the money he carried, nnd then flung the lifeless body into n tunnel from the car window.

M. Pasteur has resolved to extend his studies In vaccination to yellow fever, with view -of determining whether or not the isease is due to parasites and can be guard' ed against by inoculation. A broad field of Investigation is o;ien to Pasteur, as It is sug gested bv hi discoveries thus far that all contagious maladies may be due to parasitic growths, the virulence of which may be so reduced by his method of Inoculation as to reuder this class of disesses no longer a mat ter of drand.

Mr. C. 8haler Smith ha given the re sult of extensive observations in relation to the pressure exerted by the wind. The most violent gale recorded by him was at East St. Louis, In 1871, whon the wind over turned a locomotive, the force developed in so doing being no less than 93 pounds per iquare foot. At St. Charles a jail was des troyed in 1877, tho pressure required being 84 pounds per square foot. At Marslifield, iu 1880, a brick mansion was levelled the force necessary being S3 pounds per square foot. Below these extraordinary pressures, Mr. Smith instances uumerouscases of trains blown o!fra!ls,aud bridges, etc., blown down by gales of 24 to 31 pounds per square foot. In all the examples the lowest force requir ed to do the observed damage has been tak en as the maximum power of the wind, al though, cf course, it may have been higher. Enthusiasts who make a special study of sun-spots and attendant phenomena be lieve that the corner-stone of a new science s being laid,discoveries pointing to an inti mate connection between solar and lerrcslr ial'meleorology. Just what the connection is they are not yet able to clearly define, al though electricity is suspected of being the agent through which tho .effects are mani fested upon our planet. It Is known that the gaseous envelope of the sun is effected by eruptions of such prodigeous magnitude as to be utterly, beyond the power of concep tion, these disturbances appearing to us in the form of rapidly changing spots and pro- uberonces. The eras of the spots or sun- storint occur at remarkably regular inter vals, a complete cycle of the'various stages of activity from maximum to minimum aud again to maximum being performed in aboutelcven years the so-called "sun-spot period." The sun spot physicists claim a coincidence of th perlodsof maximum s-ots aud years of great atmospheric and physical disturbance in the earth. The present has been a year of great solar,disturbances, while it has been marked by violent storms and earthquakes upon our globe. Further than this, these scientists claim to have recently delected, by simultaneous observation, mln or atmospheric changes tt the result of cor responding movements in the sun. Many difficulties attend these observations, but the Astronomer Royal for Scotland and others believe that tho state of the sun will some day become an important factor iu "weather forecast and like calculations. 

WASHINGTON. Faoit ova RsnuLin CoastsroxnisT. Washington, D. C, Dec. 3,1681 This bas been Guiteau's week at the City Hall, and the crowd that has been moving to that edifice during the past few days bas been mere persistent than ever. This morning there was a perfect jam for twp hours in the vicinity of the cast wiug, and those whose business gave them the right to a space in the interior had to make a. fight to get there. Coun sel on both sides, witnesses, jury, court officials were caught in the tide and the utmost encleavois of tne police were necessary to extricate tbem. The result of this crush was a delay of some twenty minutes in the opening of the court. The oourt room itself seemed full to bursting. As on previous days, four out of five of the audience were ladies. There were two or three rows of ladles standing in the rear of the raised seats, where tbey remained during the sitting of the court, clinging to unything they could lay their hands on, A good many prtminentiu dlvidnals, among them Acting Attorney Phillips, several Congressmen and others were shut outside and their efforts to gain admission were fruitless. The prisoner looked paler and more baggard this morn ing. The restless, haunted look appears to have permanently settled in his coun tenance. A government expert on insan ity who talked with Guiteau to. day says that if the trial should last two months the prisoner would be hopelessly imbe cile. It is apparent from the cross-ex amination of Guiteau, as well as in the opening speech of Col. Corkhill, that the prosecution intends to show, if possible, that the assassin in firing the fatal shot was more moved by viudictiveness and revenge than by any "inspiration, It has already been established that the conception of the idea of murder occurred just about the time the President, v. earied of Guiteau's annoying persistence, gave biin to understaud that be would not lis ten to him. That the assassin is of a malignant, vindictive disposition, has been shown upon several occasions. Ill abuse and, no doubt, slanderous accusa tion against bis former wife, becsuse she was called to testify for the-government-, furnished an illustration of the revenge ful spirit within him. He stoutly insist ed that both Mason and Jones should be punished to the fullest extent of the la' for attempting tbs very deed be is now seeking to justify in himself. The prose cution will probably elicit many facts going to show that Guiteau was "inspir ed" to commit muder by tits derilisk nature, and thai-ire 'dlifit'to gratify "his malice. It is an accepted theory that an unsound mind cannot dwell rationally and consecutively upon any subject, but that it becomes flighty and incoherent. If this be true, then it is a point against the insanity of the assassin. Since bo bosii eon on the stand be bas gone over bis entire life, relating incidents of years ago, giving date, circumstances and de tails with most reasonable accuracy. There bas been no wavering in bis story. He never misses an opportunity to as sert and reassert his inianity and bis "in spiration" as the motive of the deed. There is now a Slalwnrt revel in Wash ington. The men who lisped the praises of Garfield when be came into powor.and the men who spoke of bis suffering nnd probable death with tremulous voice, are not heard in the hotels, or the streets, or in the departments. His sun has aet,ahd the fitful worshippers of the Capital'wbo have praise for every ruler and contempt for every ruler of the past, nstr speak of Arthur as the saviour of the party: the statesman of the age; the candidate of 1884. Blaine is about to retiro to his qnlet home in tho Pine Tree Stale. Win dom lias gone and is now his own succes sor in the Senate. MacVeagh has gone amidst jeers of the now triumphant pub lic plunderers be had the courage to grap ple with while supported by the Presi dent James is limited to the New Year, when be will slve place to his Stalwart successor. Hunt and Klrkwood will be unknown injand about the Administra tion twenty days hence, and it is now probable that even Lincoln will not sur vive the general wreck of the policy upon which Garfield laid the foundation of his Administration. In the selection of the successors of the Garfield Cabinet, no Garfield man need apply. Democrats will be generously considered by tbo new Administration wben necessary, but the Girfield Republicans will ever be Strang- rs to the favor of the Arthur reign. A majority of the Senators and Mem bers of Congress are already ou band. One can almost tell tho section by the dotbing. Those from the South come with heavier overcoats than they are ac customed to wear at home, and tbey feel tbo extra weight; those from tho North wear lighter materials than the regions of Maine, New York and Minnesota ordi narily require. There is a look of "work to be done" on every face, and of bend down to it with tremendons energy. Busi ness of great importance is to be trans acted, and the members new and old, seem to feci that there should bo no delay nnd no child's pity. August. Faou oua SrrciiL CoaaxsroyoKiiT. Wasiiixotok, Dec. 5,1831. There is life enough about Washington now. I he clans have been gathering rapidly for some days aud bnzzings are heard which indicate the renewal of hos tilities ou Capitol Hill. The chaotio con dition to which vacation, neglect, dust nnd abandonment reduced even the grandeur nnder the Capitol dome, has suddenly disappeared and new life has taken possession of the corridors so long deserted save by the Inoktrs-on. During the past week employees have been dtul- ng and brushing, and new Congressmen ktrolling here and there familiarizing themselves with the various wayxaud by ways of tbs building which' tbey expect to make tremble with the tbundtrs of their eloquence. The attendant retinue of clerks and assistants are in their places and strangers, office-seekers and loungers are everywhere. Everything has been put in apple-pie order. The Senate chamber is as complete and tidy as a lady's parlor warm, Dioe, dy, cheery, comfortable--and the Hall nf Represen tatives is scarcely anything behind; all is as elegant as for a bridal party. The renewal of activity is not confined to the abodes of Congress. It is every where about the city the hotels, the boarding houses and nil places of resort. Congress makes Washington. For sev eral months, except at the time of Presl dent Garfield's funeral, the hotel corri dors have been deserted and lonely places; now they are thronged day and night, and one only has to visit the different bead quarters to meet hundreds of familiar ftces that do not belong htre, and to see groups of office-seekers, Congressmen and lobbyists! button-holiug each other for dear-life. One evening while the speak ership contest was at its zenith of uncer tainty I saw In the lobby of a prominent hotel at one time three candidates for Speaker, two for Clerk of the Uouse, one for Sergeant-at-Arms. and about twenty- five aspirants for lesser positions. There were also two ex-Governors and several ex-Congressman aiding the candidates in their attacks on tbo poor unsuspecting members-elect, of whom a goodly num ber were in the crowd. The Congress man is an important personage at such a time, and when it is all over and every thing settled be must feel lonesome as though he had lost his best friend. President Arthur has at last gone into the White Uouse to live. Everything is as neat and bright as a new pin since the old bouse has been fixed up. The Presi' dent will occupy for a sleeping-chamber a room that has rartly been used for that purpose by his predecessors.thongh Gen Grant occupied it for a short time. It is very spacious, measuring about thirty by twenty feet, and is over the private din ing room. It is fully as large as the Red Parlor down stairs. During Gen. Grant's two terms this room was known as "Miss Nellie's room," being that usually occu pied by bis only daughter, Tho cbam ber is on the north side of the house and with the tmiller room adjoining occupies the north est corner. Tbe sun never shines on tbe large room. Tbe small one will be, so to speak, the President's bou doir and communicates with the larger one by a mahogany door. Tbe question that has lately agitated our society circle is, "what lady will 'preside' at the Whit House, and assist at receptions, etc?' ut it has been settled by the President, who lays thai' the wife of a member of bis Cabinet whose name is not yet made publlo will assist in dispensing tbe bos- pitalltlea of the Executive Mansion. In fact be expects all ladies of bis Cabinet to come to tbe rescue in doing the hon ors. His married sister bas cares enough of ber own and the unmarried one is not able to perform tbe duties. There will be none but formal entertainments given at the mansion this winter that is to say dinner parties and publlo eveuing recep tions. No sue will be there on whom the ladle can call sociably as they have been in the habit of doing heretofore. Dor fzdso. New Advertisements. w, n. doolittib. n. n.
