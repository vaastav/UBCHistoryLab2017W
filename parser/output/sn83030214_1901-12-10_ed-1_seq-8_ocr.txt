Without striving for literary effect, but seem ingly with the purpose of sharing a multitude of pleasant recollection? with his friends and musical peop> generally. Mr. William Mason ■wrote down his observations made during an active musical career of over fifty years, and pi II III them in the pages of "The Century Magazine." They have now been brought to pether In a tasteful manner between binder's boards, illustrated with portraits and reproduc tiens in fa'- simile from th* author's autograph album, provided with a handy index, and thus m=de a nortion of the musical history of the nineteenth century to which future writers will turn v.ith much pleasure and some profit. The work of the reproductive musician, like th^t of the actor, is fleeting. Compositions re n-.^in. ard. despite changes in tastes and ideals. ttey retain something of their validity for the historian who is what the word implies. Musi <Li r- finances are creative activities in a F.r.Pi". but ,1 is only the story of their effect v^-n the people who hear them and record their i:np:t:sions that remains after the performer lias passed away. Memoirs, like those » of Mr. Jlasni are therefore welcome to those who would Slke to look at the heroes of a period fTiVxr than :;.cir own.

Mason Joined the colony in 1653. raving spent the preceding; four years in Leip sic. Dresden, Prague and elsewhere, studying •with Mosehelefi, Mi II I. Hauptmann 'and Alex ander Preysrh^ck. He also meets Chopin, Wag ner. rhalberg End other lights. Himself l^ng ■ concert pianist (it is interest ing to note that he claims to have been the first pianist to have given concerts exclusively of pianoforte anisic and alone in America), and one whose *-=rly artistic days were spent in such distinguished presences, it is not surprising to find Mr. Ma* filling many pages with descrip tions of the manner it. which the pianists of fifty years ago played. Such recollections are of the kingdom of heaven in the eyes of the later historical writer. Mr. Mason also carries his observations down to the young artists of to day, but here he contents himself, as a rule, -with amiable peneralizings. He believes, evi dently, that there is a saving virtue in growing old gracefully and with a cheery view of th •world as it stands, and a pleasant opinion of the generation that has come to take the places of the people who were the heroes of his early pages. It is an amiable disposition; and we should not quarrel "with it even if it made for mischievous notions in criticism. There is. how ever, more instruction in what he says about old style players and old style playing than in what he says about the new. He studied with Moscheles, and it is plain from his description that in that egotistical old master there still lived some of the traditions which dated back to the early days of the nineteenth century. Moscheles, says Mr. Mason, was in a direct line of descent from dementi and Hummel, and the immediate predecessor of Thalberg. He was fond of quoting the older authorities, of holding them up as excellent examples for his pupils. Be advocated a very quiet hand position, con fining, as far as possible, whatever motion was necessary to finger and hand muscles: and by way of illustration, he said that dementi's hands -were so level in position and quiet in motion that he could easily keep a crown piece on the back of his hand while playing the most rapid passages. This is a clear reminder of the old harpsichord days when fleetness of finger and clearness of execution were the first requi sites of playing, and strength of wrist was not at all called for. Thalberg's playing was char acterised by grace, elegance and finish in de tail, and he played the arabesque scale passages end arpeggios with which he was fond of orna menting his melodies with rapidity, clearness and brilliancy. Mr. Mason accepts the old story* that the inventor of the manner of "writing which became identified with Thalberg's name was the harpist. Parish-Alvars, forgetful of the lact which Dehn established long ago that Giuseppe Francesco Pollini used the device long ■before either Parish-Alvars or Thalberg in his "Metodo pel Clavicembalo." Mr. Mason did not hear Chopin, but Drey schoek Uf««*4 to describe his playing as extremely delicate and exquisite, 'hese qualities being cul tivated because of Chopin's lack of physical ftrength. Two anecdotee are told in illustra tion. The nrßi was told by L-reyschock, who said that he had once attended a Chopin concert in Pari6 in company with Thalberg. They listened with delight throughout the perform ancp. but on reaching the street Thalberg began shouting at the top of his voice. What' 6 the matter?" askrd Dreyschock. in astonishment. "Oh." said Thalberg. "I've been listening to piano al! evening, and now, for the sake of con trast. ~i want a little forte." The other story was vouched for by Mr. Fran cis Korbay: A young and robust pianist had been playing Chopin's "Polonaise Militaire" to th? composer, and had broken a string. When, in confusion, he began to apologize, Chopin said to him: "You Tig man. if I had ynur strength and played that polonaise as it should be played, there wouldn't *»c a sound string left in the in strument by the time I got through.' Henselt s playing was specially characterized toy a warm emotional touch and a delicious legato, causing '.he tones to melt one into th" other, but without confusion or lack of clear rt .<t: Preyschook was especially famous for his wonderful left hand and his octave playing, and accomplished the feat of piayir.g the left hand part of Chopin's study in C minor in octaves, though it cost him twelve hours of study a day Jor six wt-eks to prepare himself for the feat, which he attempted under the stimulus of a r»rr.ark rr.ade l>y TY.maschek. his teacher. Of Lift's i>ying we must permit Mr. Mason to Fj.eak ir. 'rrs own words: Time and again at Weimar I heard Liszt play. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that he was the greatest pianist of the nineteenth century. Liszt was what the Germans call an •Erscheinupg" — ah epoch-making genius. Taus tt:ic is reported to have said of him: "Liszt dwells alcne up'"n a solitary mountain top. and none of us can approach him." Rubinstein said to Mr. William Steinway in the year 1573: "Put all the rest of us together and we would not make one Liszt. " This was doubtless hyperbole. • but nevertheless significant as expressing the enthusiasm of pianists universally conceded to "be of the highest rank. There have been other great pianists, some of whom are now living, but I must dissent from those writers who affirm that any of these car. be placed on a level ■with Liszt. Those who make this assertion are too young to have heard Liszt *ther than in his declining years, and it is unjust to compare the playing of one who had icng since passed : hie prime with that of one who is still in it. In the year 1873; Rubinstein told Theodore Thomas that it was fully worth while to make a trip to Europe to bear Liszt play, but he added: "Make haste and go at once; he Is al ready beginning" to % break up. and his playing is not up 10 the standard of former years, al though his personality is as attractive as ever." ." . . The difference between Liszt's playing anC that of others was the difference between creative genius and interpretation. Hi« genius flashed through every pianistlc phrase, it illu minated a composition to its innermost recesses, i and yet his wonderful effects, strange as it must «<«. «n proved without tte aav.ijw^o! muscles: hence a lack of econoraj in the ex penditure of his energies. » Mr. Mason knew Oottschalk well, and «*»£s dnated by his playing, which was full of brill iancy and bravura. "His strong, rhythmic ac cent, his vigor and dash, were exciting and al ways around enthusiasm. He was the pe.fec tion of his school, and his efforts had the , spark c and effervescence of champagne." Kubinstein had transcendent ability, but he was too im pulsive, and lost self-control and self-possession. He was. therefore, an uneven player, but a thor oughly conscientious artist. Yon Biilow s Chopin playing impressed Mr. Mason as dry. and his Beethoven interpretations lacked warmth and fervency. But he had an extraordinary memorj. remarkable technic. was invariably accurate and precise in his careful observation of rhythm, accentuation and phrasing. m^-i,; Mr. Mason touches lightly but interesting on the domestic affairs of Yon Bulow and Wag ner. The general impression has long been that when the latter won the love of his wife away from his friend the shock came near shattering Yon Bfllow's mental as well as physical heath. Mr. Mason says that he knew that Yon Bulow had accepted the matter philosophically, and in proof relates the following anecdote: V r n ir r^ h x 2sr^£sii&|S and I thought it just as well to arrive imme diately at a clear understanding. "Bulow- I said, "you will excuse me if I touch on' a rather delicate subject Of course, vcur friends abroad know just what > our pre em attitude is toward Wagner: but over here we St. or nothing about it Perhaps you would like to enlighten me. I hope lumber, I P^at happened was the most natural thing in the wortdL «» know what a wonderful woman OMfma if such intellect, such energy, such ambition, which she naturally inherits from her father I was entirely too small a personality for her. She required a colossal genius like Wagners, and he needed the sympathy and Inspiration. of an intellectual and artistic "-Oman Wee <;0™;; 0 ™; That they should have come together eventuall> was inevitable." Here, finally, are two contributions to what the Germans would call the "characteristik" of Mr. Mason's most admired master: Deep beneath the surface there was in Liszt's organization a religious trend which manifested itself openly now and then, and there were oc casions upon which his contrition displayed itself to an inordinate degree. Joachim Raft long his intimate friend and associate, told me that these periods were sometimes of consider able duration, and while they lasted he would «eek solitude, and. going frequently to church, would throw himself upon the flagstones be.ore a Muttergottesbild. and remain for hours, as Raff expressed it. so deeply absorbed as to oe utterly unconscious of events occurring in his presence. Rubinstein also told me that on one occasion he had been a witness of such an act on the part of Liszt. One afternoon at dusk they were walking together in the cathedral at Cologne, and quite suddenly Rubinstein missed Liszt, who had disappeared in a mysterious way. lie searched for quite a while through the many deluded nooks and corners of the immense building, and finally found Liszt kneeling b< fore a prie-dieu. so deeply engrossed that Rubinstein had not the heart to disturb him. and so left the building alone. I have mentioned that Liszt was careful in his dress He was also particular nhout the ap pearanoe of his pupils. 1 remember tw"o in stances which show how particular he was in litt'e matters. I have been nearsighted all my life and when I went to Weimar 1 wore eye giasses, much preferring them to spectacles. Eyeglasses were not much worn in Germany at that time and were considered about as affected as the mode of wearing a monocle. The Ger mans wor" spectacles. I had not been in Weimar long when Liszt said to me: "Mason. I don't lik^ to see you wearing those g'.asso?. T shall pond my optician to tit your eyes with spectacles. hardly thought that he was serious, and so pai.l no attention to him. But sure enough, about a week later there was a knock at my door, and the optician presented himself, saying he had come at the command of Dr. Liszt to examine my eyes and fit a pair of spectacle? t'> them. As 1 was evidently to have no say in the matter, I submitted, and a few flays later 1 received two pairs, one in a green and ono in a red case. I thought them extremely unbecoming, but 1 was very particular to put them on whenever I went to see Liszt. Not long afterward Liszt went to Pnr:=, and when we called to see him after his return, and h" was talking about his experiences there, he said casually: "By th» way. Mason! 1 find thai the gentlemen in Paris are wearing eyeglasses now. In fact, they are considered quite comme il faut, so I have no objection to your wearing yours." As he did not ask me to ?pn! him the sr.fctacl p F. I kept Thc-m, and hay th f> m to this day. "YAWLBTG." THE NARRATIVE OF A GLORIOUS VOY AGE. A YEAR IN A YAWT.. A True Tale of the Ad ventures of Four Boys in a Thirty Foot Yawl. By Russell Douhi^dav. From the Log of Cap tain Ransom. Illustrated. Octavo, pp. viii, 353. (Doubleday. Page & Co.) This is the story of a trip that was in many ways unique. The travellers were four boys. and their boat, which they built themselves, ■wsp only thirty feet in length. Yet in her they sailed from Lake Michigan, by way of canals and rivers, to the mouth of the Missis sippi; csasted thence along the shore of the Gulf, rounded the end of Florida, and made their way up the Atlantic Coast to Norfolk. Philadelphia and New-York, by way of the Karitan Canal. Continuing up the Hudson and through the Erie Canal and the lakes, they finally reached home, after a journey of more than seven thousand miles. The motives of the chief en gineer of this ambitious undertaking are set forth in the following somewhat obvious but most enthusiastic speech: Listen. I've studied this thing out and I know it can be done. You know what I want to be and what I want to do. and there is no way of seeing all kinds of boats and experiencing all kindte of weather and conditions of water anil climate except by seeing and experiencing them. The best and most, thorough way of doing it, it seems to me, is to go in a small boat you have built yourself and see everything at first hand. Po the four boys went, and they saw most of the things they wanted to see and experienced more kinds and conditions of water and wind than seemed to them at the time at all desir able. The Gazelle, as they named their yawl, had numerous narrow escapes from various kinds of disaster. She was bumped by other boats, ran into bridge piers because the wind failed them and the draw would not open, ran rapids and dodged reefs. Off Baton Rouge the yawl encountered a terrific ice storm, which forced her to lie to for several days, and nearly sunk her into the bargain, with the weight of ic* it deposited upon her. Her youthful crew had to*turn out in lively style with axes and chop the ice off her decks, or she would doubt less have gone to the bottom. It was not a grateful task, for the thermometer stood at "1 degrees below zero, and the yawl pitched and rolled like a crazy thing in the force of the gale. "And this in the Sunny South!' wrote the weary captain sarcastically in his log. Off Pt. Josephs Bay the wind failed the Ga xelle. and one of her wmsw put off in the yawl's tender and went fishing. He caught the biggest fish he had ever seen. It was nothing less than a 12-foot shark, and for a time it looked as if the shark was fflhing for boy and not the boy BMr shark. However, the crew got the fish after a long fight. Not long afterward, the young voyagers passed a fleet of sponge fishing boats, had a ride on a monster turtle, and performed other feats all of which are veraciously recorded. The Gazelle proved a stanch boat, and her crew a courageous and skilful one. When the age and inexperience of the young sailors are taken into NEW-WkS -DA7ET TRinUKB. TPESDAY. DECEMBER 10. 1901. consideration, the Gazelle's voyage seems scarce ly lese noteworthy than any one of the voyages tcroaa the ocean made in an open boat by older sailors. Books anD flnbhrations.
