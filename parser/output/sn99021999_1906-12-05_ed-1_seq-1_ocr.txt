Mr. Van Cleve condemned strongly men who oppressed their employes, declaring such a man to be "a worse cltlsen than th demagogue he assails." Mr. Vun Clove said In part: Mr Cliulrman and Gen.lemen: I am In vited to acl.lr' vi.iii today as the president ol the National 'Association of Manulnc turers, which represents millions of work era snd billions of dollars of capital. It Is by far the strongest organisation of any sort In this country. My subject will be the "fit Irons' Industrial Association from the Standpoint , of the Manufacturer." It Is for us to understand that some of the captains of Industry, the heads of great aKrregatlor.a of capital and some em ployers of labor In general, are responsible for Uompers and Hearst.

Nevertheless, while recognising and com mending the good tha unions have done, l cannot clone our eyes to the evtle annia of their tarhlr- arc Inciting. In the in teres r of lndisi rial r.'r and lastlnr har mony bt ween '; plovers and workmen we must oppose those principle and methods of the unions which have been opposed by the most prominent men of the country, men friendly to labor fend champions- of a square deal f r capital and labor alike. Those men condemn, as we do: First The closed shop. Second The restriction of the number of apprentices. Third 1 he boycott. Fourth The attempt by labor leaders to draw class lines and to make the laborers believe the employers are their enemies. We muet also, as patriotic Americans, condemn the blacklisting snd proscription bv tl.f American Federation of I-Kbor in the recent election. The laborers outside I the unions ho constitute ten times aa many workers as within the unions are op posed to the enactment of laws which tne labor union bosses are attempting to push through congress. As an ally in combating the extremists who Would revolutionise society and assail the Individual a property and social rights all good citizens should welcome such o operatlon as the labor unions afford. For this reason the employe: who would like to strlk down all labor unions Indiscrim inately Is blind to hl own Interests as well faithless to his duty to the general publiev Wa must.

The Intentions and attitude of the In terstate Commerce commission respect ing the car shortage In the northwest are made clear In a letter addressed to Senator Hansbrough by Chairman Knapp, which a--s: The Inability of shippers to secure cars for the movement of their truffle 1s re ported from various parts of the country and amounts in some sections, ns you observe, to almost a CHlamity.

He said there had been a general urgent demand for coal this winter and that on many or ders the company were two months or more behind. He said he knew of no dis crimination In the matter of furnishing ca in. At the completion of Mr. Welborn's testi mony Commissioner Clarke said: "Well. Mr. Welborn, your testimony in regard to the shortage of cars resolves Itself Into this: You have more orders for coal than you can produce and can produce more than you can get cars to carry V "Yes, sir." replied the witness.

EVIDENCE PILES IP IN BIG TRIAL Witness After Witness Testlaes to Being Subsidised to File en Land He !evrr Intended to Occupy. Wholesale testimony was adduced yester day In the big land trials In the federal court to the effect that agents of the de fendants had persuaded the witnesses to file on land they never Intended to occupy or Improve, took them to the land free of charge and assured them they could dis pose of their claims at remunerative fig ures. Tom Huntington and Anuilla Trip lett continue to be dragged In by witnesses aa potent factors In this crusade of col onisation for the big land and cattle men. "I was paid by the Nebraska Land and Feeding company, by check signed by Mr. Jameson, for the livery teams furnished by me to take th old soldiers out to their claims from Gordon. The descriptions of the lands were furnished me by Tom Hunt ington and he told me where to find the lands, r.ear some windmills snd In certain valleys. He also gave mo the number of the lands." Such was the testimony given by Ira Trueblood, the Gordon liveryman, who took several old soldiers out at different Inter vals to see their claims. Th(s witness was followed by his brother, Ben TrueMood, who gave similar testi mony and who was associated In the livery business at Gordon with the first witness. This witness said he wss told by Hunting ton to show the old soldiers over some flats out near the Overton ranch. He did not know of any particular name being applied to the flats. Livingstone's View of Law. At the beginning of the hearing Tuesday j morning A. H. Livingstone was recalled ! to the stand. He told particularly of his j understanding of the Klnkaid law and of his Intent to comply with the law accord ing to that understanding. The words, "for my own use arid benefit." he applied literally and assumed that it meant that he could sell the land for S300 or any other sum after making final proof. He did not understand that the Kinkald law required actual settlement on the land, but that cul tivation was equivalent to settlement, and that leasing the land to sn sgent for graz ing purposes was perfectly legitimate. Had he had any other understanding of the law he would not have entered the land, he said. Francis J. Porter a banker of Woodbine and an old soldier, expressed a similar un derstanding of th Kinkald law and took up the land only on that understanding. He had no Intention of defrauding the gov ernment, he said, nor of making an appli cation for land under any other version. He distinctly understood and believed, he said, that the offer of S300 for the land after final proof was a togltimaU transac tion and that no one would b wronged by th transaction. -- "I simply wanted to get out of the land what I could," said he. Kw Baa of Operation. In th testimony of the last witness of the forenoon the scene of operations wa shifted to the Alliance land office and at Ellsworth, with Aqullla Triplet, as a prom inent figure in soliciting cntrymen to file on lands near Ellsworth. This witness s James W. Newell of Alliance, who was a traveling auditor for the Burlington rail road. He said he had been approached by Triplett and solicited to enter land near Ellsworth, and did so, selecting a piece of land about three-fourths of a mile north west of Ellsworth. Triplett gave the wit- ; P,, a description of the land and th Wil I could find a purchaser for the land if h ever wsnted to sell It, but no particular person was named. gpade Ranch Fliers. All of Tuesday afternoon was devoted to hearing the testimony of witnesses who made filings within the Spade ranch at the Alliance land office.

Meat oi the President's Message Government should have right to appeal in criminal cases. Technicalities should not outweigh merits in law suits. Lynch law is denounced in unsparing terms. Education is the solution of the "race" problem Labor and capital alike should discountenance the agitator and demagogue, who do harm always and good seldom. Hours for railway employes should be strictly limited. Eight-hour day not applicable to isthmus; nor should there be any quibble as to color of man who does work there a white man cannot do. Eight-hour day for all workers is sure to come. Child labor law for District of Columbia should be drastic. Employers' liability law should be enforced. Compulsory arbitration a solution for labor diffi culties. Control of corporations should be extended by con gress. Inheritance tax and income tax laws are needed. Technical education for mechanics and farmers an advantage. , ''' Divorce laws should be uniform; race suicide a deadly sin. American shipping interests deserve attention. Free trade for the Filipinos and citizenship for Porto Eicans, with some improvements for Hawaiians and Alaskans, are suggested. Eights of all people should be regarded; hostility to ward the Japanese is unfair and unwarranted; Japanese should be allowed to become naturalized citizens. Peace is always desirable, but war is honorable. Army and navy the surest guarantee of peace. 

WASHINGTON. Pec. 4. The annual mes sago of the president of the United States to th congress was read In both bouse at noon today. Its domestic recommenda tions ar as follows: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: As a nation we still continue to enjoy a literally unprecedented prosperity; anu It Is probable that only reckless specu lation and disregard of legitimate busi ness methods on the part ot the business world can materially mar this prospcVit y. No congress in our time has done more good work of importance than the present congress. There were several matters left unhnlshed at your last session, now ever, which I most earnestly hope you will complete before your adjournment. I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already t-l one h""8" ol congress. Let individuals contribute they desire; but lt us prohibit in ef fective fashion all corporations from mak ing contributions for any political pur pose, directly or Indirectly. Government' Rlsht to Appeal. Another bill which has Just passed one house of th congress and which it U urgently necessary should be enacted Into law Is that conferring upon the govern ment th right of appeal In crimlnai case on questions of law. This righ-. exists In many states; It exlsta In tne district of Columbia by act of the con i i n'v ease' a verdict for th defendan gress. It Is, ot course, not proposeu mat I conviction obtained under It, and Hi defendants santenced to imprisonment. The two cases referred to may not he In real conflict with each other, but It is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At present there if no way by which the government can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to b solved by an appeal to a higher court, and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. I tan not too strongly urge th passage of the-bill tn question. A failure to pass It will result In seriously hampering the government In its effort to obtain Justice. especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also prevent the governm-Tit from obtaining Justice for wageworkrrs who are themselves able ef fectively to contest a case wher the judg ment of an Inferior court ha been against them. I have specifically in view a recent decision by a district Judge leav ing railway employes without remedy for violstion of a certain so-called labor statute. It seems an absurdity lo permit a single district Judge. aKalnst what may be th Judgment of the immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declar a law solemnly enacted by th congress to be "unconstitutional." and then to deny to the government trie right to have th supreme court definitely decide the uuts tlon.

In connection with this matter I would like to c II attention to the very uuajii. factory state of our criminal law. result- (lM i n luri, r.cirl rmm llie nurilt or -fltriir f ... 1 r r I, I n tn . Imw Juat find lninilHPitl. erlfl. courts; In which case of course the legisla tion would be Ineffective. Moreover, 1 be lttve it would be wrong altogether to pro hibit the use of Injunctions. It Is crlrnm.il to permit aymputhy for criminals to weaken our hands In upholding the law; and If men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no Impairment of the power of the courts to deaf with them In the most summary and effective way pos sible. But so far as possible the sbuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. Abase of Injunction. In this matter of injunctions there la lodged in the hands of tne Juuiclary a nee essary power which Is nevertheless subject to the possibility of grave abuse. It la a power that should be exercised with ex treme tare and should be subject to th jealous scrutiny of all men, and condemna tion should be meted out as much to th judge who fails to use It boldly when nec essary as to the judgo who uses It wantonly o.- oppressively. Of course a Judge strung e .loiiK li to be fit for his office will enjoin any resort to violence or Intimidation, espe cially by conspiracy, no matter what bis opinion may be of tl rights of the original quarrel. '1 here must be no hesitation in dealing with disorder. But there must like wise be no such abuse of the Injunctive power as la Implied In forbidding laboring men to strive lor their own betterment In peaceful and lawful ways; nor must tha injunction be used merely to aid some big corporation In carrying out schemes for Its own aggrandisement. It must be remem bered that a preliminary Injunction In a labor case. If granted without ailsquil proof (even when authority can be found to support the conclusions of law on which It is founded), may often settle the dlsputo between the parties, and, therefore. If im properly granted, may do Irreparable wrong, let there are many Judges who assume a matter-of-course granting of a preliminary Injunction to be the ordinary and proper judicial disposition of such case and tlier have undoubtedly been flagrant wronar committed by judge in connection with labor dispute even within tiie last few yeara, although 1 think much less often than In former year. Such judge, by their unwise action. Immensely strengthen th hands of thus who ar strlvu entirely to do away with the power of Injunction, and therefore such careless use of th Injunc tive process tends to threeiten It very s Utence, fur If the American people ever become convinced that this process is hubitually abued, whether In m.tt-ra af fecting labor or In matters affecting cor porations, it will b wellnigh impossible to prevent Its abolttkn. Criticism of Court. There Is one consideration which should be taken into accoui.t by tha good peopi who carry a sound proposition to an ex ecs in objecting to any criticism of a judges decision. The Instiuct of tha American ixrople as a whole Is sound in this maiur. Tney will not subscribe to tha doctnn that sny public servant is to t abov all criticism. It th best citixena. tho most competent to xprea their Judgment In such matter, and above ail, tho belonging to the great and bonorabi profession cf th bar, so profoundly In fluential in American llf. tak the position that ttier snail be no criticism of a Judg umlsr any circumstances, tnelr view will not be accepted by the American people as a whole. In such event th people will turn to, and tend lo accept a Justifiable, th Iniemperwls and lmpror criticism uttered by unuorthy agitators.
