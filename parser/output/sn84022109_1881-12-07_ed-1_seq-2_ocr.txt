accuracy of a few passages hut as a wholo wo feel con fldent It appears in our columns precisely as read in congress yester day The message is a long ono J t treats of every conceivable subject within the fccope of presidential purview Uomiug at the hour it did we have found it im practicable to accord it more than the brielest consideration too brief to he candid to attempt anything in the nature

this message will not prove weari oine or insipid The circumstances under which its author came to be the head of the union no lens than the earlier incidents of his nolitical lile all combine to
