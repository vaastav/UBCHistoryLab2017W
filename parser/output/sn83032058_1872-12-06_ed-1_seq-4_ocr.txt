He has not ignored the democrats in the conven tion, and seems to be conscious that there arc over 300,000 democratic to tera in this state, who are entittled to some consideration. A. G. Curtin has been appointed as chairman of the committc on the Executive De partment. Public and Muuicipa) Debt, C. R. Buckalew. Private Cor porations, Geo. \V. Woodward. Dec laration of Rights, Wm. Hopkins. Constitutional sanctions, J.?. Black, —ail democrats. Mr. M'AHister is chairman of the committee on Suffrage, Election and Representation, also a good selection as we would sooner entrust the affairs of that important commute into the hands ofMr. M'AHister, than any oth er republican we know of in that body —he will discharge his duties free from partisan bias. Seargeant Bate®, an American, is just now making a fool of himself by a tramp, on foot, through England, bearing the American flag, having en tered into a bet with some one that he could perform such a feat without be ing molested. We have no doubt be can, unless in his walk he comes across a son of John Buil, who is as big a fool as himself and who may wish to kick his backside. But whether Bates e®- cape a kicking or not, will not settle the question that England is not a tolerably free country, and if he should be greet ted with rotten **hegs" and at some points be denied a bite of "am," or have an application of sole leather administered U> br seat, it would only be accounted for on the score that Johu Bull became enrage*! more at the fool than at the flag he carried. Gen. Grant haa lately done two things for which many radicals, who lately supported him, will curse him, and are already doing it, while the democrats give him credit. These are the appointment of Fairman, as post master of Philadelphia, instead of Tru man, who belongs to the ring and whom Cameron insisted on having ap pointed. but got snubbed ; the other is the promotion of that gallant sol dier, Gen. Hantlcock, to the position made vacant by the death of Gen. Meade. President Grant Lad beeu treating Gen. Hancock very, very nieanly all along, and banished him to the re motest and most isolated frontiers out of 9heer spite, and contrary to the rules and usages which apply to a soldier of Gen. Hancock's rank. Gen. Han cock submitted to all this shabby treatment without a murmer. It is one of the little and discreditable things in the life of Gen. Grant which he now would gladly wipe out, and while the entire democratic press, and other right thinking men sensured President Grant for his mean treat ment of Gen. Hancock, they give him credit for doing him what is simple justice now, and what was meanly de nied him during the last four years. We give c-redii where credit is due, and should President Grant lift him self above the past littleness of his na ture, and keep snubbing the Camerons, and tbat£clasa of thieving radicals, we shall praise him for it. Let's see bow long he holds out in this course. Death of Horace Greeley. We are pained to chronicle the death of Horace Greeley, which oc curred on last Friday evening. His death is a loss to the nation, and at the present stage of American politics, his death is to be regretted by every American citixen. The nation has sustained a lose—he occupied a posi tion, as editor-in-chief of one of the most influential journals in the couu try, which gave him an influence and an opportunity for good, that few oth ers, if any, can be found to fill, at pres ent. Mr. Greeley may have had —did have —his faults ;of these il does not now behoove us fo speak ; but he had his good qualities and enough of them, to entitle him to the respect of all. He was honest, he was sincere, and he was fearless in the ad vocacy of what he thought was right. Nothing else can be said of Horace Greeley, scan his life as you may covering the last thirty years, and this is what can be said of too few of our great men, who are .time-servers and in whom selfishness and the desire to gain place and wealth is the controlling motive, and without aDy re gard as to the meaos by which they obtain these. In tbe present hour, when the government in its every branch is reeking with corruption, and when the constitution and law are violated with the greatest possible non concern, we believe that the nation sustains a loss in the death of Mr. Greeley, for he was enlisted IB oppo sition to these abuses, and was dealing corruption and asal-admistration the hardest blows they received, and his paper became a terror to the evil doers of the radical party, of .which he had been the fermost champion, hut which be did not hesitate to Jash with A whip of scorpions when it so notorU ously forsook the path of duty. This, Mr. Greeley h been engaged in for] several years, ami all honest men re gret that his life tens not spared, that he might continue in the good work of seeking to purify the government and hring it back to the good old standard [of hon-csty which'once was it:- charno teristie. All accord toMr. Grrcley hon eolyfof purpose, although many,and the democrat* particularly, may have dif fered with him and thought hi n er rtic upon a ccitaiu great if- te. He believed he was right —we d raoemts believed he was wrong. That issue has passed—it was decided in favor of *Vr. Greeley—let it be dead with him. Hut in the present, and as far as re gards the future of the government, he was right, he was democratic, and he had the honesty, the manliness and courage to say that the radical party, the party of his own making, was wrong, and ho was among the bold est aud most powerful opponents of that wrong, and his stand did much to check abuses, and bad ho liv es! to continue in the battle for the right, its triumph would have been hastened. Mr. Greeley was a generous hearted mau; he was pemtinifil of tho noblest social qualities;he was strictly tem perate iu all his habits. Of his abili ty as a thinker and a writer, wc need say nothing, his powers iu thev-o re spects are knowu. As a speaker be never was rated high, until the last campaign—for want of opportunity or because he never strove to show his powers in that line —but the speeches be made during the last presidential campaign proved that in this rvspect he was a truly remarkable matt also. His speeches were all so cfcarly to the point; so full of meaning uud good sound sense tbat none of his moat bit ter opponents could pick a flaw in them, a tribute which cannot bo paid to the addresses of any other presiden tial candidate who undertook to ad dress the public at the time of his candidacy. But, as the life of Horace Greeley is so familiar to all, we will not go to further length iu this article. Hor ace Greeley is dead —the natiou sus tains a deep loss—Peace to his ash es. Harry White the Blatherskite. The Pennsylvania Senate for quite a number of years has been pestered with a member, called General Harry White, of Indiana county, the same chap, who, during the war, was south, not to fight but to look, and was cap tured by the rebs and held at Rich mond. He is the greatest success as a paper general we know of—he never fought any, aud we are doubly sure he never died a bit for his country, or for any body—yet he is Gtv. ra! Har ry White, and stands [ romincut among all the dunghill roosters about the capkol at Harrisburg. He is a great talker, likes to hear himself talk and imagins every-body else has the same liking, in which he is greatly mistaken—for he is a disagrcable talk er, and as an imitation of tbo braying of an ass, bis speeches are a perfect success. Ho can draw just as long, broad and disagreeable as that ani mal, only the ass has the advantage of him by knowing wbea to keep qui et. In the senate, he pokes his gab into every thing, and this propensity for gab has made him disagreeable to all his fellow members, for bis deliv ery is disagreeable, aud his talk has nothing in it —he is a perfect walking definition of the word "Blather-kite." Yet general Harry White stands at the head of the capital roosters, and he may yet be governor —stranger things have happened. This Harry Blatherskite White, is a member of the constitutional con vention, to the disgust of every decent member of that body. True to his na ture, he brays into every thing that comes up, and will, as lie docs in the senate, monopolize more pages upon the record than any other three "talky" members in it. It is a pity there is not a provision somewhere to make the aapheaded blatherskite subside, so tbat the con vention could get along without the annoyance. 114 is the noisiest empty tin-can that ever turned up, and tied to a dog's tail, the dog's death would be certain from fright. Wc hope gen eral Harry White, will let the conven tion go on without inflicting his dis agreeable talk continually upon that body upon every subject, to the an noyance and disgust of the rest of the members —none of whom is fond of hearing him. The Proposed Official Ontli. A few weeks previous lo the meet ing of the constitutional convention, we favored, iu these columns, a elau-c in the constitution by which all mem bers of the legislature should be re quired on taking the oath, to swear, that they will accept no bribe directly on indirectly, for any vote or action taken by them as such. Wo* sec that one of tbe members of that body has introduced a resolution to that offrct of which a Harrisburg paper says: The new oath for civil officers, pro posed to be incorporated in tlic ameu ded Constitution, if'adoptcd, would revolutionize tbe usages and practices of political parties, and is the first rec ognition in the reform convention, that there are fraud aud corruption in politics. The oath compels the man who qualifies on going into a civil of fioe, to swear or affirm that he paid no one to secure him such an office; that he gave no bribes of any kind to se cure his nomination, and that he is un der no promise to any man or men, to shape his official course to meet their individual interests—in short the oath is to prevent .candidates for office to resort to any foul <uifiatif to secure such places. We repeat, if theoatii en forced, the occupation ofthe profession- j a] politician is gone, or perjury become i as eqtgmon as pea-nuts. —Horace (ireeley .was 62 years of uge. His funeral took place on Wednesday 4th. The President's Message. Coogroos met on Monday. Prasi <lonl CJmnl'i MtMgn i* long and dry. Contains nothing now, nnd it mostly a summary of the reports of the heads of the different departments. The Pitts-j burg l\ut' article uj>on it, embraces a fair idea of the document : The document Urt* out in the usual way of thankfulness to the (liver ot all Good, refer* to the Ito.ion and Chicane fires, notes how tin | t-ojilo are rallying under their mit fortune* and how free we have been from war je*liteiiee and other 0 iUmitior. The happy termination of our trouble with Ureal Hiilain is referred to in which a high compliment is paid t* Charles Francis Adams. The quaoUon between this country and Groat Uritain in regartl to the flherteshas been ilDpeo<t of and legi-dation to carry out the provision* of the treaty are asked for. The bounda ry line with the llrilub poestoas receives a passing notice, and an inviUtiou is asked fbr the International Otngro*s to hold iu next session in the I'nited States. The Vienna exposition receives considerable attention, as it deserves, and money and f two naval vessels to transport article*, so as the United States will be properly rep resented u desired. Our ufiairs with Mex ico, Spain, and other foreign powers are alluded to with all of which wo are upon the most friendly relation*. Provision is urged for distressed seamen iu foreign countries, and then come extracts from the report* of the secretaries of the various departments, one of them the most iinpor ant, the Treasury, and in which Mr.Grant now makes, or Mr. lluutwoll has made some very huge blunder* in regard to the reduction of the debt. A* there may b* some mistake in trans mitting the figure* over the wires, we deter further comment tor the present. The message then refers to river and harbor Improvements, and favorable attention is requested to suggestions of the Secretary of War m regard to the appointment ot cadets and other matters. Some other questions aud suggestions; how they should be met are spoken of. and the abo lition of the franking privilege is rcecom monded. Then come* ths question ef the Government taking posession of the tele graph lines. Grant is in favor ot this—in fact it is one of his pet schemes. It gives him considerable more power and soius thirty, perhaps fifty thousand additional efilcers to appoint, all calculated to assist in centralization. Whatever action is tak en he says he wants to be fair to the Gov eminent and to private parties concerned, lie says there is an alarming falling ofi in our carrj ing trade, and thinks that an expenditure of $5,000,000 per annum for the next five year* would help our mer chant marine Should'nt wonder. The President informs us that the dis bursement* through the Department* ot Justice have somewhat increased and blame* it on the reckless and lawless men of the South. He much regrets the neces sity for the Enforcement Act, and hopes the cause for applying it may not be again demanded. Most likely it never will be, provided the people act and vole as Grant tells them. Tho Indians receive sotno attention. Patents and Pensions are mentioned, and Compulsorv Education is commented upon and commended to the favorable attention of Congress, which is asked to pass tin bill appropriating the net proceeds of lan h for educational purposes in the varioui States. An appropriation to improve th* public grounds and buildings in washing ton is solicited, and the hundredth anni versary of American Independence favor ably alluded to. The message closes with reference tc Civil Service Reform tn which the Presi dent coniesscs that Federal offices har< been regarded too much as the reward oi political services, and promises to apply the rules as he understands them, but w< hardly infer from this that he will appoint any Democrats. It is needless to say that the document falls far behind what the country had a 1 right to expect. It has nd comfort for ths I South, neither for th* colored populatios j who so recently appealed to the President to say something in favor of civil rights. I It my delight somo but it will not ths masses. A New Question. Mr. Greeley'* death has raised a new question—one which now arises for the first time For whom shall the demo cratic and liberal electors cast their vote? Some propose Hendricks of Indiana—we would agree to that, no botfe-r and more deserving the compliment can be found. Again, suppose Grant should die after the electors cast their vote for him (which was done on last Tuesday) and before be is in augurated, who would be the next Presi dent? The electors could not be called together again, as their duty would have been performed and their office at an end. Somo have their doubts, whether in such a contingency tho Vice President elect would become the President. The Salted Jewel Fields. The Whole Tiring Denounced at a Shameless Fraud. . SAW 

FRAWCUOO, NOV. 25.— The Chronicle of to-day exclusively prints a full expose of the diamond swindle, 1 which has just been discovered to be one of the most gigantic frauds ever perpetrated on the public. The fields, belong to the New York and Sat) 1 Francisco Diamond Company. They were discovered by J. F. Bar ry of Salt Lake. The claim, which is about fifty miles from Fort Bridges, in Summit county, Colorado, turns out to have been salted with stones purchased in London six or eight months ago. Arnold and Slock, the men who lo cated the claim, are said to have made! one million out oflhcswindle, N>s.r ly all the capitalists in San Franciscc are out from 820,000 to 8100,000 each by the transaction. The directors held a meeting to-day and acknowledged tbntthey had been duped, but claim that Calitornlans are not to blame. There is great excitement in fbis city over the disclosure.^ A TRIAL OF 50 YEARS.

I DEATH OF HORACE GREELEY HlB ILLNESS AN HL ANT-HOL' IIS New Yoke, November 29, —The, Tribune furnishes the following nc- | count of the illness and last hour* ol Mr. Greeley: So far a* any of hi* associate* knew Mr, Greeley was in al- 1 most good health a* usual, when one day after the election he wrote a card announcing hi* resumption of the edi torial charge of the Tribune. Hi* sleeplessness wu* known to Iwomr 1 greatly worwe, but for vear* ho had| *utfered more or le*a from tho tatue difficulty, and a* i* now clear auffij cient allowance bad not been made for the intense strain upon hint through- j out the autumer, eepecisllv during the j lust month of hi* wife* illnea*, out it iwmmi become evident that hi* elrcuglli, was unequal to the hard task to which he had set himself. He wrote ouly 'three or four careful article*, one of them half a column in length. The moat notable oerhsps was that entitled "Conclusion*, 1 wherein he summed up hi* view* of tho canvass. All he wrote was less thau throe and a half column*. At last, on Tuesday, the 12th inst.. he abandoned the effort to visit the of fice regularly, and scut for hit family Physician. Effort was ruado to induce sleep, but he grew steadily worse, until it became •evident that his case was critical, l)r. i George P. C'hoate and others were Icalled in for consultation, and finally it was decided to take bim to Dr. jcboate's residence, two or three miles Jistaut from Mr. Greeley's own couu j try house, at Cbappaqua. Here he received uuremitliug attention from Dr. Choate, Dr. Brown, and Dr. 8e- Iquard. Dr. Brown and others were called in for consultation. Tha in soniniu had developed into inflama liou of tho bruin, aud under this the venerated patient rapidly saiik. At times he wa* deleriou* ; at other times as clear-headed as ever. He lost flesh and strength with startling rapidity, and in a few days his speedy death forced itself into unwilfing recogni tion. It was not, however, until Thursday that his associates and fami ly brought themselves to admit it; even then thev still clung to his faith in the vigor of his constitution. Ou Wednesday nigbt he failed very : rapidly. Thursday moruiug and eve ning he was deemed somewhat easier, • dur:ng the uight he slept very uneasy, muttering occasionally aud frequent ly raising his right haud. Towards morning he was more quiet, and be tween eight aud niue o'clock fell into a nearly unconscious condition, which continued with some intervals through the day. lie made an occasional ex clamation, but many of them in con sequent* of his extreme weakness and apparent inability to finish what ha 'begun were unintelligible. About noon "however, he said quite distinct ly, and with some force, "I know that my Redeemer livetb." During the day he recognized various people, his daughter many times, the members of his household at Chappaqua, Mr. Juo. 'K. Stuart, and Mr. Reid. On the whole he suffered little, and seemed to have no more thau ordinary restless ness which accompanies the last slage of disease. About half-past three he said distinctly, "It Is Done." And beyond briefest answers to question* ibis was hi* last utterance. Hi* youngest daughter, Mia* Gabrielie, was with bim through Thursday eve ning. Throughout Friday the elder . daughter, Mus Ida, was in constant t attendance a* she had been during the whole of his illness and of Mrs. Gree ley's before him. At ten minutes hefere seveu o'clock the watchers drew back in reverent stillness from the bedside. The great editor was gone in peace after so many struggles in honor after so much oblo quy. The German Minuter in Washing ton has received information to the ef fect that owing to the disturbed ami threatening condition of France aud to prevent the hagira of arms-bearing men from Germany, strict orders have been given to the owners of all vessels leaving German ports to immediately raise their rates of charges to emi grants to all foreigu ports. M. Thiers will attend the session of the Assembly to-day, when the report of the ruajoritv will come up for con sideration. The excitement of the last few days has greatly subsided and all is quiet in Paris and the provin ces. Nine bodies have beeo recovered from the ruins of Boston fire, and five of them identified.

Brave wan, he do • served a nobler fate than the dog's death , 1 he received. I Etna and the Lipari Island* come into view. Smoke is always issuing from the crater of Etna and fumes from that of Stromboll. The day was somewhat hazy so that we could not verify the fact. It is said that Stroroboli, serves as a natural light house, visible for nearly fifty.mile* all around. The third day out we cast aticber*al Pa ; lermo, in Sicily. The engine had scarcely , j been reversed until we were boseiged by ' score* of noisy,, clamoring boatmen, yell f ing at the top of their voire* in a horrible .mixture of bad French and worse Italian ] and striving with each other fur the job of ' i taking us on shore.

Unfortunately Centre Uall has met with her reverse* and just at I present J* very much in need of a (borough | ,] reconstructing, from the fact thai one man' is as good a* another and a great deal bet ter. Just now wrangling, malice, hatred, i and scandal seems to be the order of the day. Charity is a stranger here now; charity thinketh no evil, rjok-eth not in iniquity and boareth all thug.. It take* no pleasure in hearing or talking of the ; Cam led or real faults of others ; it sayt, let: 411 bitterness and evil speaking be pott tway rum you with alt malice.

But how did you know it wa* not false' How seldom they who spread an evil report take any pains to Investigate It* (truth. Be sure before you repeat a charge that it is true. Once uttered you cannot recall it He to w horn you te!fit tell* oth |er*. Before repealing an evil report we I should ask does charity prompt m , am 1 ] seeking the good of others ; but I will just 'tell my friend, at the tame time enjoining .ecrecy on him. The causo* of this evil vpeaking of other* is various sometime* from eovy. The wise and the good are j rendered less superior in the <-y.* of the j world when some evil is siid of them, 'then from hatred and revenge. O. what a eowardlyjuiethod of retaliation I why | not stand up face to (ace with your enemy and tell him of bit fault*.

As greedy vultures pouncing down upon a putrid ' carcase, at filty die. buzsiug round a stinking dirt heap, all the po*si|ter* who ' with evident relish utter detraction or listen to it, "Whrn men combine to hate and treat on ill, Must be return them good and love them still. But if hi* nam* and character they tear, And cruel malice too, too plain appear. And when be sorrow and affliction knews They try to add unto hi* cup of woes." In conclusion let me say to mt western friends they have my heartfelt thanks for their kindness shown me while sojourning in their midst. And to all contemplating a visit to the west, that they will never re gret it, is my honest conviction. A. 5.
