With the commission thus relieved of some of its present duties and equip ped to bandle Its business more prompt ly., the railroads will urge that the pe riod during which the commission may now suspend proposed increases In rates be reduced from ten months to 110 days, with provision for reparation to be paid to the shippers If the ad vance shall he declared unreasonable. poss They will also ask that the commis sion be given the power to prescribe minimum as well as maximum rates so that in meeting complaints of dis crimination the commission may order the advance of a rate which it consid ers too low. One of the most important recom mendations for which the railroads will ask favornble consideration Is that the commission lie specifically authorized to take into account in rate regulation the effect of rates upon total earnings in the light of ex penses. While the Newlands Committee is required, under the resolution creat ing it, to submit a report by January 2 next, it is not anticipated tliut the Committee will have coiue anywhere near completing its labors then.
