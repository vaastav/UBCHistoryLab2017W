Four mem bers of the so-called Jennings gang of outlaws were lodged in jail here tonight. AI and Frank Jennings, the reputed leaders of the band, are among the pris oners. The two Jennings brothers and Tom O'Malley -were captured byvfour of United States Marshal Bennett's men early this morning, while traveling in a covered wagon, east of here, toward the Arkansas line. Tne deputies surprised them on the road, and they surrendered without firing a snot. The deputies then went to a house near Band Switch and captured Morris O'Malley, catching him in "bed. Since last Tleaday the deputies had been close upon the trail of the ban dits, for whom there are standing re wards aggregating $8,000. On Tuesday last Marshal Bennett's men encountered the gang at a house in the western part of the Cherokee nation. The deputies succeeded in arresting John O'Malley, but the others made their escape at that time and had evidently satisfied them selves that the officers had been eluded, es they were not prepared to resist when surprised today. Tne Jennings iboys and their followers are charged with various crimes, but were particularly wanted for the hold up of a Rock Island passenger train in broad daylight, several months ago, near Chlckasha, I. T. They are also accused of having stolen four hundred head of cattle from the Chickasaw nation. Al Jennings has been a leader in Okla homa politics. He was at one time fiunty attorney of Canadian county, and la a lawyer of considerable ability. nd both Al and Frank are graduates of the University of Virginia. Another brother was killed by Temple Houston of Texas, during a saloon row about two ; ears ago. Al Jennings was shot in the nrm during the same affray. The broth ers come of a highly respected family. Their father is probate judge of Wood ward county, Oklahoma.

It will roe remembered that Colonel For rest at the last statehood convenjpn was chosen as chairman of the committee on credentials; he and his committee -were at work when the convention took a no tion to adjourn sine die. The colonel knew nothing of the adjournment until four or five hours after the convention had fallen into "innocuous desuetude" and a majority of the participants were either drunk or returnng to their homes. He Insists that a convention cannot ad journ indefinitely while it has commit tees out at work, and that therefore the wild and wooly aggregation of howling sovereigns which met in Oklahoma City two years ago are still in session, and tha: he is ready to report whenever he can catch the eye of the chair.

Fletcher and O. B. Ke, with some friends visited an ice cream parlor in Chandler and informed the proprietor that they had bet the ice cream and wished to eat It then and as soon as the bet waa decided the loser would pay the bill. That was all right, and they par took of the cooling refreshments, after which the proprietor asked what the bet was and when it would be decided. Kee explained that he 3iad bet that the spire of the 'Methodist church would fall south and Fletcher bet that it would fall north, and that the bet would be decided when the spire fell. In the course of time a cyclone caime along and the whole build ing -went north, and -now Fletcher in sists that Kee should hunt up that ice cream man and pay the MIL EL RENO'S PROSPERITY S LARGELY OF CUB (ID THE CURB N President McKinley's Message to Congress is a Thoroughly Con servative Document.

It was thought two weeks ago that he would 'travel the long and narrow trail. Here is another evidence of prosperity. Last year the Rock Island railroad used the depot at this point for a whistling statlon.few passengers got on or off the cars and the freight business would not pay the salary of the baggage master. Last month the company did a business of $S1,35S, and the chances are that dur ing the month of December the freight and passanger business will get close to $100,000. Saturday 125 car loada of cot ton were unloaded at the compress and freight yard. Helen, the 3-year-old daughter of Charlie Casswell, county attorney, got hold of a -battle of carbolic acid and glycerine, Saturday, and drank a por tion of the mixture. .The parents of the child received a scare they will remem ber for some time to come.

Surely it should not pay them out ag3ln except on demand for gold.

FINANCIAL BAROMETER. In my view, it is of the utmost Import ance that the government should be re lieved from the business of "providing all the gold required for exchanges and ex port. This responsibility is alone borne by the government without any of the usual and necessary banking powers to help iteelf. The banks do not feel the strain of the gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the government and the size .of the gold reserve In the treasury has come to be, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of secur ity. This ought to be stopped. If we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient receipts for the expenses of the government, we may feel no immediate embarrassment from our present currency; but the dan ger still exists and ever will be present, menacing us as long as the existing sys tem continues. And besides it is in times of adequate revenues and business tranquility that the government should prepare for the worst. "We cannot avoid without serious consequences the wise consideration and prompt solution of this auestkn.

Guthrie, O. T., Dec 6. (Special.) A special from Atchison says: Atchison people generally believe that Charley Loller is still alive and a report was even circulated about a week ago to the effect that he was improving and would prob ably recover, but Jt has just leaked out that he died in Oklahoma September S. The matter was kept quiet by Loller's relatives in order to secure a compro mise with Captain David Baker, in their 10,000 damage suit against him. It will be remembered that young Loller waa arresteJ some time aso and that while resisting arrest Captain Baner, -who was then pohce commissioner, struck him on the head with a cane, inflicting, as the Lollers claim, permanent Injuries, for which they brought salt for 510,000 dam ages. Young Loller afterwards accident ally shot himself at Potter, and after lingering between life and death for sev eral mcn'ihs. was taken lo Oklahoma, where he died on September S, at above stated. It is understood that a compro mise was recently etfectetf Tn the dam age suit and that Captain Baker is still ignorant of the young man's death.

THE EXTRA SESSION". The extra session of this congress, which closed during July, last, enacted important legislation, and while Its full effects have not yet been realized, what it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent value further time will be required, and the people, yatisfied with its operation and results thus far, are Sn no mood to withhold from it a fair trial. CURRENCY.

On July 1, 1SS5. the principal of the interest-bearing debt of the government was $2,332,331,205. On the first day of July, 1S93, this sum had been reduced to 55S5.037.100, or an aggregate reduc tion of J1.747.294.10S.

EVILS AND REMEDIES. There are many-pkins proposed as a remedy for th& evil. Before we can finJ the true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It Is n:i that oar currency of every kind is not good, for every dol- 1 lar of i: is good; good because the cov- ernment's pledge is out to keep It so, and that pledge 'will not be broken. How ever, the guaranty of our purpose to lteep the pledge will be best -shown bj advancing toward its fulfillment. The evil of the present system1 if found1 in the great cost to the government of maintairiing the parity of our different forms of money that is, keeping all of .them at par with gold. TVe surely can not be 'longer "heedless of the burden this imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperous conditions, -while the past four years have demonstrated that "it is not only an expensive charge upon the'ffbvernmenr, 2rat a-'-dangerous, men ace to the national credit. ALL 

GOLD OUT; JN'O GOLD TN. It 6s manifest that we must devise some plan to iprotect the government against bond issues for repea-ted re demptions. "We must either curtail the opportunity for speculation, made easy by the -multiplied redemption of our de mand obligations or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. We have $000,000,000 of currency which the gov ernment by solemn enactment has un dertaken to keep at par -with gold. No body is obliged to redeem In gold but the government. The "banks are not re quired to redeem in gold. The govern ment is obliged to keep equal "with gold all its outstapdlng currency and coin obligations, -while its receipts are not required to be paid in gold. They are paid In every kind of money but gokl, and the only means by which the gov ernment can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most needs It. The govern ment without any fixed gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and faithfully done and which, under the authority now given, it will continue to do. "THE ENDLESS CHAIN." The law which requires the govern ment, after having redeemed its notes. to pay them out again as current funds demands a constant replenishment of the gold reserve. This is especially so an times of business panic and when the i revenues are insufficient to meet the ex penses of the government. At such times the government has no other way to supply its deficit and maintain re demption but through the increase if its bonded debt, as during the administra tion of my predecessor, when 5262,313,400 of 4U per cent 'bonds were issued and soklKind the proceeds used to pay the expenses of the government in excess of the revenues and sustain the gold re serve. While it is true that the greater part of the -proceeds of these bonds was used to supply deficient revenues, a con siderable portion was required to main tain the gold reserve. With our revenues equal io our ex penses, there would be no deficit requir ing the issuance of bonds. But if the g3kl reserve falls below the 5100,000,000 how wiH it be replenished except by sell ing more bands? Is there any other way practicable under existing la-w? GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD. The serious question, then is, shall we continue the policy that ha3 been pur sued In the past; that Is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger. Issue more bonds and supply the needed gold or shall we provide other means :o pre vent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no further legislation is nad. and the policy of selling: bonds is to be continued, then congress should give the secretary of the treasury author ity to sell bonds at Iorur or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. A FIXANCLVL TTT-FOR-TAT. I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts, of the government are quite suf ticlent to pay all the expenses of the government, that whtn any of the Unit ed States notes are presented for re demption in gold and are redeemed in gold, such note shall bt kept apart and se: apart, and only paid oa: in exchange for gJlJ. This Is an obvious daty. If the holder of the United States note pre fertthegoldan eta mcfdlwuyp etaoinn fera the gold end gets it from the gov ernment, he should not receive back from the government a United States note witaoat paying gold la exchange fcrlL The reason for this is made an the mors apparent whec the foversznect : rence of a df-pleted gold reserve and save us from future embarrassment on that account. To that plan, I invite your careful consideration. I concur It'a the secretary of the treas ury in his recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue cotes to the face value of the bonds whicti they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by de posit of such bonds be reduced to one half of one per cent per annum. I also join him in recommending that authori ty be given'for the establishment of na tional banks with a minimum capital of 525,000. This will enable the smaller vil lages and agricultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet their needs. I recommend that the Issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomin ation of ten dollars and upwards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the approval of congress, then I (would recommend that national banks be required to redeem their notes in gold. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. The t'olrsa Question. The most Important problem with, which this government Is now called up on to deal pertaining to its foreign rela tions concerns jts duty towards Spain and the Cuban insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less in common with itfcosenow existing La,Q confronted this govercsnent in various times in the p.iit The story ot Cuba for many years hr.s been one of urxreet; growing discon tent; an effort toward a larger enjlyment cf liberty and self-control; of organized resistance to tne mothfr country; of de pression after distress and warfere, and of ineffectual settlement, to be followed by renewed revolt. For no enduring- r.e itol dnce tho enfranchisement of the continental possessions of Spain in the Western continent has- the condition of Cuba, or f.e pcllcy cf Spain toward Cu ba, not caused concern to the United Stated. THE MONROE DOCTRINE. The prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon the island and tho political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home government might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power, called forth, between 1S23 and 1S60, various emphatic declara tions of the policy of the United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba's con nection with Spain unless Jn the direc tion of independence or acquisition by the United Statea'througb purchase; nor has there been any change of this de clared policy since upon the part of our government. THE TEN YEARS WAR. The revolur'on which began in 1S63, lasted for ten ytare, despite the strenu ous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress It. Then, as now the government of the United States testified its concerr end offered Its aid to put an end to bloodshed In Cuba. The overtures made by General Grant were refused and the war dragged on, entail ing great lo?a cf life and treasure, and increased injury to American interests, Lesides throwing erxranced burdens of neutrality upon this government. In 387b p-tzo waa brcuxrht o bout by the truca of Zanjon. obtained by negotia tions between the Spanish commander, Matfni De Campos, and the insurgent leaders. THE PRESENT INSURRECTION. Tne present insurrection broke out in February. 1S93. It is not my purpose at this time to recall its remarkable in crease or to caaracterlze its tenacious resistance against the enormous forces massed against it by Spain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue carried destruc ticn to every quarter of the island, de veloping wide proportions and defying the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of "war has "been dis regarded no less by the Spaniards than by the Cubans. 

MEDLVTION REJECTED. The existing conditions cannot bat fill thi3 government and the American peo ple with the pravest apprehension. There is no de?ire on tne part of our people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have cnly the desire to sec the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying tnat raiioure ol eIf-ccntroJ which U the In alienable right of man, protected la their right to reap the benefit of the exhacst les3 treasure of thfir country. Tho offer made ty 'ay predecessor la April, 1SS5, tendering the friendly offices of this government, failed. Any media tion oa our part was not accepted. In brief, rhe answer read: "There is no effectual way to pacify Cuba unless it begins -scjta the actual snbmSesloa of the rebeis to ihs mother country.' THE CONCENTRATION PLAN". Then, only couM Spain act 1n the prom ised direction of -her own motion and after hr own -plana. The cruel p$2cy of concentration was Initiated Febmary 1?. 15i.

It was soon after this that she manifested sigsi9 of returning conscious ness. The first .nourishment received for several days had a telling effect, and she nt once rallied. There 1s again stronger hope that she may recover sufflciently to survive until the president reaches her bedside tomorrow morning, and perhaps to recognize him. Ic is not thought, how ever, that she will avor regain complete consciousness. When the attending phy sician left Mrs. McKinley this evening. It was with a feeling that she would sur vive the night and pceitbly longer. Sho had taken no nourishmtint Blnce early In the afternoon, and was not in quite as good condition as when she seemed to recognize those about her. But she sus tained little net loss of strength during the day and was reposing in a quiet and seemingly natural condition. 10:30 p. m. Mrs. Meg I nicy is exceed ingly low. She has just experienced an other sinking spell, during, which life seemed to be almost extlncft. There are smcie moments when she does oot seem to "breathe. If she rallies from this spell she will probably survive the night, but just now -it seems d6uTtful that she will rally. Her pulse Is Tteak and uncertain, more so than at any otjher time, and her breathing is difficult. Tha physician when he last called reported that'she had .weakened perceptibly. Washington, Dec 6.
