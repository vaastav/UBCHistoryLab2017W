Washington Special—Following 1* a Summary of President Taft's flrat annual message which was delivered to both bouses of congress: After reviewing at considerable length the satisfactory relations be tween the United States and European powers, President Taft takes up the relations between this country and Latin-America, saying In part: Protect American Capital. Today, more than ever before, Ameri can capital Is seeking Investment In for eign countries, and American products are more' and more generally seeking for eign markets. As a consequence, In all countries there are American citizens and American Interests to be protected, on occasion, by their government. These movements of men, of capital, and of commodities bring peoples and govern ments closer together and so form bonds of peace ami mutual dependency, as they roust also naturally nometimes make passing points of friction. The resultant situation Inevitably Imposes upon this fio.vernment The Pan-American policy of this gov ernment has long been flxod In Its prin ciples and- remains unchanged. With, the Changed circumstances of the United •tates and of- the republics to the south of us, most of which have great natural resources, stable government and pro gressive ideals, the apprehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be aald. to have nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as It exists nor any other doctrine of American policy should be.permitted to operate for the perpetua atlon of Irresponsible government, the esoapo of Just obligations, or the insidi ous allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United States. Beside the fundamental doctrines of our Pan-American policy there have grown up a realisation of political In terests, community of institutions and Ideals, and a flourishing commerce. •se bor Is will be greatly strengthened as -tin* goes on and Increased facilities, nch as the great bank soon to be estab lished In Latin America, supply the 553? bja-ssa fcan vastly Increased responsibll- ties. This administration, through the department of state and the foreign serv ice, Is lending all proper support to legit imate and beneficial American enterprises In foreign countries, the degree of such support being measured by the national advantages to be expected. A citizen himself can not by contract or otherwise divest himself of the rigtit, nor can this government escape the obligation, of his protection in his personal and property rights when these are unjustly infringed la a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless vexations It Is proper that In consider ing whether American enterprise should be encouraged or supported In a partic ular country, the government should give full weight not only to the national, as opposed to the Individual benefits to ac crue, but also to the fact whether or not the government of the country In ques tion Is In its' administration and in its diplomacy faithful to the principles of moderation, equity and justice upon which alone depend International credits, in diplomacy as well as In finance. tor building up the colossal Inter- continental oommerce of the future. Martin* With Dias. meeting with President Dias and greeting exchanged on both American Mexican soU served, I hope, to slg --J»* the close and cordial relations which, so well bind together this repub lic and4 the 'grrtat republic Immediately to the south, between which there Is so vast a network of material interests. I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our eolationswith. Venezuela have been set tied within the past few months, and that undor the. enlightened regime now directing the government of Venezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining q^se before The Hague tribunal. On July 30, 1»», the government of Pan ama agreed, after considerable negotia tion, to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having. In deed, been killed by the Panaman police this year. JH» sincere desire of the government of Panama to do away with a situation where, such an accident could occur la manifest: In the recent request In com- Rmt 1(4® &V Uance with which this government has the services of an officer of the army to be employed by the government of Panama as Instructor of police. The collection of the customs of the Dominican republic through the general receiver of. customs appointed by the president of the United States In ac cordance with the convention of Febru IT hproceeded In an unevent fujand satisfactory .manner. -Thtoi government was obliged to Inter vene diplomatically to bring about arbi tration or settlement of the claim of the b# arbitrated. A settlement of thle troubtasoxne case was reached by t£ stature of a protocol on September *liaajr years ago diplomatic Intervention became necessary to the protection of the Interests In the American claim of Aslop ,9°*nRJi?ly against the government of Chile.

'SZXSZZS ated*t£ the Jftyal to their bo bo leaa un the sad tale Mi have put to forces of to the itsmotal nmOT-m It&sikiestmc iii. emment Is endoavorlng to facilitate these measures and the needful acquiescence of treaty powers. When it appeared that Chinese llkln revenues were to be hypoth ecated to foreign bankers In connection with a great railway project, It WHS ob­ vious that the governments whouo na tionals held this loan would have a cer tain direct Interest In the question of the currylriK out by China of the reforms In question. Because this railroad loan rep resented a practical and real applica tion of the open door policy through co operation with China by Interested pow ers as well as because of itB relations to the reforms referred to above, the admin istration deemed American participation to be of great national interest. Happily, when it was u» a matter of broad policy urgent that this opportunity should not bo lost, the Indispensable Instrumentality iresented Itself when a group of Amer bankers, of International reputation and great resources, agreed at once to share In the loan upon precisely such terms as this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that Amer ican railway material should be upon an exact equality with that of the other na tionals Joining In the loan In the placing of orders for this whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. It Is gratifying that Americans will thus take their share In this exten sion of these great highways of trade, and to believe that such activities will give a real Impetus to our commerce and will prove a practical corollary to our historic policy in the far east. In one of the Chinese-Japanese con ventions of September 4 of this year there was a provision which caused con siderable public apprehension In that upon Its Ti.ce It was believed In some quarters to seek to establish a monopoly of mining privileges along the South Mnnchurlan and Antung-Mukden rail roads, and thus to exclude Americans from F. wHe field of enterprise, to take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough exam ination of the conventions and of the several contextual documents, the secre tary of state reached the conclusion that no such monopoly was Intended or ac complished. However, In view of the widespread discussion of this question, to confirm the view It had reached, this government mado inquiry of the lmpe rial Chinese and Japanese governments and received from each official assurance Department of State. I earnestly recommend to tho favorable action of tho congress the estimates sub mitted by the department of state and most especially the legislation suggested In the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby It will be possible to devel op and make permanent the reorganiza tion of the department upon modern lines In a manner to make It a thoroughly ef ficient Instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American in terests abroad. The consular service has been greatly Improved under the law of April 6, 1906, and the executive order of June 27, 1906, and I commend to your consideration the question of embodying In a statute the principles of the present executive order upon which the efflclenc' service 1s wholly dependent. cy of our consular Government Expenditures. Perhaps the most Important question presented to this administration is that of economy In expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The deficit of the last fiscal year, and the certain deficit of the cur rent year, prompted congress to throw a greater responsibility on tho executive And the secretary of the treasury than had heretofore been declared by statute. This declaration imposes upon the sec retary of the treasury the duty of assem bling all the estimates of the executive department's bureaus, and offices, of the expenditures necessary In the ensuing fis cal year, and of making an estimate of the revenues of the government for the same period and if a probable deficit is thus shown, it is made the duty of the president to recommend the methods by which such deficit can be met. The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will ex ceed the estimated receipts by $34,075,620. If to this deficit Is added the* sum to bo disbursed for the Panama canal, amount ing to 38.000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be In creased to a total deficit of 73,075.620. This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds ofibonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama 'canal. I approve this proposal. The policy of paying for the construc tion of the Panama oanal, not out of cur rent revenue, but by bond Issues, was adopted In the Spooner act of 190S, and there seems to be no good reason for de parting from the principle by which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity who are tt enjoy It and there Is all the more reason for this view because the actual cost to date of the canal, which Is now half done and which will be com pleted. by January 1, 1915, shows that the cost of engineering and construction will be $197,766,000. Instead of $139,706,200, as originally estimated. In addition to en gineering and construction, the other ex penses, Including sanitation and govern ment, and the amount paid for the prop ties, the franchise, and the privilege of building the canal, increase the cost by $75,455,0w, to a total of $376,201,000. The Increase in the cost of engineering and construction Is due to a substantial en largement of the plan of construction by widening the canal 100 feet in the Cule bra cut and hy Increasing the dimensions of the locks, to the underestimate of the Quantity of the work to be done under tne original plan, and to an underestimate of the cost of labor and materials both of which have greatly enhanced In price since the original estimate was made. Low Estimates Made. In order to avoid a deficit for the ensu ing fiscal year, I directed the heads of de partments In the preparation of their esti mates to make them as low as possible consistent with imperative governmental necessity. The result has been, as I am advised by the secretary of the treasury, that the estimates of the expenses of the fune overnment for the fiscal year ending 10, 1911—that is. for the next fiscal year—are less by $55,683,000 than the total of appropriations for the current fiscal year, and less by $94,000,000 than the estl mates for that year. 8o far as the secre tary Of the treasury Is able to form a Judgment as to future Income, and com pare It with the expenditure for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, Including the payments on account of the Panama canal and the publlo debt, there will be no deficit In the year ending June 30, 1911, but a small surplus of $712,000. In the present estimates the needs of the departments and of the government have been cut to the quick, BO to speak, and any assumption on the part of con gress, so often made In times past, that the estimates have been prepared with the expectation that they may be reduced, will result In seriously hampering proper administration. It has been Impossible In the prepara tion of estimates greatly to reduce the cost of permanent administration. This can not oe done without a thorough re organisation ot bureaus, offices, and de partments. For the purpose of securing Information which may enable the execu tive and the legislative branches to unite In a plan for the permanent reduction of the cost of governmental administration, the treasury department has Instituted an Investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants in the United States. The result of his work In two or three bureaus, which. If extended to the en tire government, must occupy two or more years, has been to show much room tor Improvement and opportunity for sub stantial reductions tn the cost and In creased efficiency of administration. The object of the investigation Is to devise means to increase the average efficiency of each employe. There is great room Cor Improvement toward this end, not only bjl .the reorganisation of bureaus and departments and in the avoidance of duplication, but also In the treatment of the Individual employe. Favors Civil Pensions. More than this, every reform directed toward the Improvement In the average efficiency of government employes must depend on the ability Qf the executive to eliminate from the government service those who are inefficient from any cause, and as the decree of efficiency tn all the wpartmsnts ie much lessened by the re tonttOM of old employes wh« have out-I Hw their energy and usefulness, it to to asr proper system of ewwasi tho wall, conducted to has naturally grown out of the heavy 111 le oollcy ot ugly that no other practical solution of the burden of military pensions, which It has always been the policy ot ou to assume: but I am stroni our government convinced dlfflculties presented by the superannu atlon of civil servants can be found than that of a system of civil pensions. Frauds in the Collection of Customs. I rejfi-fit to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds In the col lection of the customs revenue at New York City, In which a number of the subordinate employes In the weighing and other departments were directly con cerned, and in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining com pany and others. Tho fratuls consisted In the payment of duty on underweights of sugar. The government has recovered from the American Suj?ar Refining com pany all that It Is shown to havo been defrauded of. The sum was received In full of the amount clue, which might have been recovered by civil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an express reservation In the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not Interfere with, or prevent the criminal prosecution of everyone who was fount! to be subject to the same. Criminal prosecutions are now proceed ing against a number of the government officers. The treasury department and the department of Justice are exerting every effort to discover all the wrong doers, Including the officers and em plyes of the companies who may have been privy to the fi'uud. It wuuid neem to me that an Investigation of the frauds by congress at present, pending tho prob ing by the treasury department and the department of Justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and otherwlsu prove an embarrassment In securing conviction of the guilty parties. I Maximum and Minimum, Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference. By virtue of the clause known as the "Maximum and Min imum" clause, it is the duty of the ex ecutive to consider the laws and prac tices of other countries with reference to the Importation Into those countries of tho products and merchandise of tho United States, and If the executive finds such laws and practices not to be unduly discriminatory against the United States, the minimum duties provided In the bill are to go into force. Unless the pres ident makes such a finding, then tho maximum duties provided In the bill, that Is, an increase of 26 per cent ad valorem over the minimum duties, are to be In force. Fear has been expressed that this power conferred and duty Imposed on the executive Is likely to lead to a tariff war. I beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need be anticipated. 1 that the provision had no purpose Incon sistent with the policy of equality of op portunlty to which the signatories, in common with the United States, are pledged. Our traditional relations with the Jap anese empire continue cordial as usual. The arrangement of 1908 for a co-opera tive control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work I satisfactorily. The matter of revision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which is terminable in 1912 is already receiving the study of both countries. The discretion granted to the executive by the terms "unduly discriminatory" 13 wide. In order that the maximum duty shall be charged against the Imports from the country, It Is necessary that he shall find on the part of that country not only discrimination in its laws or the practice under them against the trade of the United States, but that the discrimina tions found shall bo undue that Is, without good and fair reason. I conceive that this power was reposed in the pres ident with the hope that the maximum duties might never be applied In any case, but that the power to apply them would enable the president and the state department through friendly negotia tions to secure the elimination from the laws and the practice under them of any foreign country of that which is unduly discriminatory. No one is seeking a tariff war or a condition In which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. Use of Tariff Board. The new tariff law enables me to ap point a tariff board to assist me In con nection with the department of state In the administration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the government In the administration of the entire law. An ex amination of the law and an understand ing of the nature of the facts which should be considered in discharging the functions Imposed upon the executive show that I have the power to direct the tariff board to make a comprehensive glossary and encyclopedia of the terms used and articles embraced In the tariff law, and to secure information as to the cost of production of such goods In this country and the cost of their production in foreign countries. I have therefore ap pointed a tariff board consisting of three members and have directed them to per form all the duties above described. This work will perhaps take two or three years, and I ask congress a continuing annual appropriation equal to that al ready made for its prosecution. I believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility and Importance whenever congress shall deem it wise again to readjust the customs duties. If tho facts secured by the tariff board are of such a character as to show generally that the rates of duties imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the princi ples of protection as described in the platform of the successful party at tho late election, I shall not hesitate to In vite the attention of congress to this fact and to tho necessity for action predicated thereon. Nothing, however, halts busi ness and Interferes with the course of prosperity so much as the threatened re vision of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after careful and deliberate Investigation, upon which such revision can properly be undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt it. The amount of misinformation that creeps into argu ments, pro and con in respect to tariff rates Is such as to require the kind of investigation that I have directed the tariff board to make, an investigation un dertaken by it wholly without respect to the effect which the facts may have in calling for a readjustment of the rates of duty. War Department.: In the interest of Immediate economy and because of the prospect of a deficit, I have required a reduction in the esti mates of the war department for the coming fiscal year, which brings the total estimates down to an amount $46,000,000 less than the corresponding estimates for last year. This could only be accom plished by cutting off new projects and suspending for the period of one year all progress in military matters. For the same reason I have directed that the army shall not be recruited up to its present authorized strength. The secretary of war calls attention to a number of needed changes in the army In all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most emphasis is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by which the merits of officers shall have some effect upon their ad vancement and by which the advance ment of all may be accelerated by the effective elimination of a definite propor- fiortlon of the least efficient. There are every army, and certainly in ours, a number of officers who do not violate their duty in any such way as to give reason for a court-martial or dismissal, but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for high command as to justify their remaining In the active service to be promoted. Provision should be made by which they may be retired on a certain proportion of their pay, in creasing with their length of service at the time of retirement. There Is now a personnel law for the navy which Itself needs amendment and to which I shall make further reference. Such a law Is needed quite as much for the army. Tha Navy. The return of the battle ship fleet from its voyage around the world, in more ef ficient condition than when It started, was a noteworthy event of Interest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world. Besides the beneficial and far-reaching effect on our personal and diplomatic relations .In the countries which the fleet visited, the marked suc cess of the ships In steaming around the world In all weathers on schedule time has increased respect for our navy and has added to our national prestige. Our enlisted personnel recruited from all sections of the country Is young and energetic and representative of the na tional spirit. It Is, moreover, owing to its Intelligence, capable of quick training into the modern man-of-warsmen. Our officers are earnest and zealous In. their the admirals do not arrive at flag rank young enough to obtain adequate, train ing In their duties as flag officers. This need for reform in the navy has been ably and earnestly presented to congress by my predecessor, and I also urgently rec ommend the subject for consideration. Early In the coming session a compre hensive plan for the reorganisation of tho officers of all corps of tne navy will be presented to congress, and I hope It will meet with action suited to its ur gency. 1 Expedition in Legal Procedure. The deplorable delays In the adminis tration of civil and criminal law have received the 'attention of committees of the American Bar association and ot many state bar associations, as well as the considered thought of judges and „-J pr* cases and faciutating the dispatch ot business and final decision in both civil and crtaOnal cases, constitute* the great eat need in our American lnstltutlona. I do not doubt tor one moment that much of tha lawtaas .violence and cruelty ex hibited In lrnrhlngs is directly due to tha uncertainties and Injuatlca growing out of the delays In trials. Judgments and tho exacuUoaa thereof by.our courts, of cowrse then remarks amhr oulta.as weU to the Hartatairailim ofjasucp la sta( But they are very great In the federal courts. The expedition with which business la disposed of both on the civil and the criminal side of KnKlIsh courts under modern rules of procedure makes the delays In mir courtB seem archaic and barbarous. The. procedure In the federal courts should furnish an ex ample for the state courts. 1 presume It Is Impossible, without an amendment to the constitution, to \jnk« under one form of action the proceedings at common law and proceedings In equity In the federal courts, but It Is certainly not lmios.slb!e by a statute to simplify and make short and dlrc.-et the procedure both at law and In equity lrj those courts. It Is not Im possible to cut down still more than It Is cut clown, the Jurisdiction of the supremo court so as to confine it almost wholly to statutory and constitutional questions. Under the present statutes the equity and admiralty procedure In the federal courts launder the control of the supreme court, but In the pressure of business to which that court Is subjected. It Is Impossible to hope that a radical and proper reform of the federal equity procedure can be brought about. I therefore recommend legislation providing for the appointment by the president of a commission with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of the federal courts of first Instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to the supreme court, and the costs Imposed In such procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and make recommendation with a view to simpli fy Iiik anci expediting the procedure as far as possible and making It as Inexpensive as may be to the litigant of little means. Injunctions Without Notice. The platform of the successful party In the last election contained the following: "The republican party will uphold at all times the authority and Integrity of the courts, state and federal, and will ever Insist that their powers to enforce their process and to protect life, liberty, and property shall be preserved inviolate, believe, however, that the rules of We procedure in the federal courts with re spect to the Issuance of the writ of In junction should be more accurately de ilned by statute, and that no injunc tion cr temporary restraining order should be issued without notice, cxcept where Irreparable Injury would result from delay In which case a speedy hear ing thereafter should be granted." I recommend that In compliance with the promise thus made, appropriate leg islation be adopted. The ends of Justice will best be met and the chief cause of complaint against1 ill-considered' Injunc tions without notice will be removed by the enactment of a statute forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunction or restraining order, whether temporary or permanent, by any federal court, with out previous notice and a reasonable op portunity to be heard on behalf of the parties to be enjoined unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the delay necessary to give such no tice and hearing would result in irrepar able injury to the complainant and unless als of the cotire shall from the evidence make a written finding, which shall be spread upon the court minutes, that im mediate and irreparable Injury is likely to ensue to the complainant, and shall define the injury, state why it is irrep arable, and shall also endorse on the or der Issued the date and the hour of the issuance of the order. Moreover, every such injunction or restraining order Is sued without previous notice and oppor tunity by the defendant to be heard should by force of the .statute .expire and be of no effect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may fix. unless within such seven days or such less period, the lnjuncf«n or order Is extended or renewed after previous no tice and opportunity to be heard. My Judgment is that the passage of such an act which really embodies the best practlco in equity and is very like the rule now in force in some courts will prevent the issuing of ill-advised or ders of Injunction without notice and will render such orders when Issued much less objectionable by the short time in which they may remain effective. Anti-Trust Commerce Laws. The jurisdiction of the general govern ment over Interstate commerce has led to the passage of the so-called "Sherman anti-trust law" and the "interstate com merce law" and Its amendments. The developments In the operation of those laws, as shown by indictments, trials, ju dicial decisions, and other sources of in formation, call for a discussion and some suggestions as to amendments. These I prefer to embody in a special message in stead of including them in the present communication, and I shall avail myself of the first convenient opportunity to bring these subjects to the attention of congress. Postoffice Department. The deficit every year in the post office department Is largely caused by the low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charged on second class mall matter, which in cludes not only newspapers but maga zines and miscellaneous periodicals. The actual iosa growing out of the transmis sion of this second class mail matter at 1 cent a pound amounts to about $63,000,000 a year. The average cost of the trans portation of this matter is more than 9 cents a pound. It appears that the average distance over which newspapers arte delivered to their customers is 291 miles, while the average haul of magazines is 1,049, and of miscellaneous periodicals 1,128 miles. Thus, the average haul of the magazine is three and one-half times and that of the miscellaneous periodical nearly four times the haul of the daily newspaper, yet all of them pay the same postage rate of 1 cent a pound. The statistics of 1907 show that second class mall matter constituted 63.91 per cent of the weight of all the mail, and yielded only 5.19 per cent of tho revenue. The figures given are startling, and show the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to the newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, and congress may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to reduce the deficit In the post office department caused by this discrepancy between the actual cost of transportation and the Compensation exacted therefor. A great saving might be made, amount ing to much more than half of the loss, by imposing upon magazines and period icals a higher rate of postage. They are much heavier than newspapers, and con tain a much higher proportion of adver tising to reading matter, and the average distance of their transportation Is three and a half times as great. I commend the whole subject to con gress, not unmindful of the spread of in telligence which a low charge for carry ing newspapers and periodicals assists. I very much doubt, however, the wisdom of a policy which constitutes so large a subsidy and requires additional taxation to meet it. Postal Savings Banks. The second subject worthy of mention In the post office department is the real necessity and entire partlcoblllty of es tablishing postal savings banks. The suc cessful party at the last election declared In favor of postal savings banks, and although the proposition finds opponents in many parts of the country, I am con vinced that the people desire such banks, and am sure that when the batiks are furnished they will be' productive, of the utmost good. The postal savings banks are not constituted for the purpose ot creating competition with other banks. The rate of interest upon deposits to which they would be limited would be so small as to prevent their drawing depos its away from other banks.''-' I believe them to be necessary. in or der to offer a proper Inducement to thrift and saving to a great many people of small means who do not now have bank ing facilities, and to whom such a sys tem would offer an opportunity: for the accumulation of capital. They will fur nish a satisfactory substitute, based on sound principle and actual successful trial in nearly all the countries of the world, for the system of government guaranty of deposits now being-adopted In several western states, which' with deference to those who advocate* It seems to me to have in It the seeds of demorali zation to conservative banking and cer tain financial disaster. The question of how the money depos ed In postal savings banks shall be In vested Is not free from difficulty,, but I believe that a satisfactory provision for this purpose was Inserted as an amend ment to the bill considered by the Senate at Its last session. It has been proposed to delay the consideration of legislation establishing a postal savings bank until after the report of the monetary commis sion. This report is likely to be delayed, and properly so. because of the necessity for careful deliberation and close In vestigation. I do not see why the one should be tied up with the other. It is understood that the monetary commission have looked Into- the systems of banking which now prevail abroad, and have found that by a control there exercised in respect to reserves and the rates of exchange by some central au thority panics are avoided. It Is not ap j. eavtngi fere with parent that a system of postal- savings banks would in any way Interfere with 4 change to such a system here.' Certain ly Ui most of the countries in. Burope where control Is thus exercised by a cen tral authority, postal savings banks exist and aro not thought to be Inconsistent with a proper financial and bsnking eye- Ship Subsidy. ftiUowinc the course of ay distln-' galahed predecessor. 1 earnestly recom-' mend to congrosa the consideration and ot a ship subsidy bill, looking to of lines between our aad tha eastern coast passage ot a ship 1 the sstalillshmant rVSS Philippines. The profits on foreign mailt are perhaps sufficient measure of thi expenditures which might first be tenta^ tively applied to this method of Inducing American capital to undertake the estab lishment of American lines of steamshlpi in those directions in which we now fee. It most Important that we should have means of transportation controlled In h« interest of the expansion- of our trade A bill of this character has once passed the House and more than once passed tin Senate, und I hope that at this session bill framed on the same lines and witt tho same purposes may become a law. New Mcxi and Arizona. The successful party In the last electloi In ita national platform declared In favoi of the admission as separate states of New Mexico and Arizona, and I recommend that legislation appropriate to this end b« adopted. I urge, however, that care b€ exercised In the preparation of the legisla tion affecting each territory to secure de liberation In the selection of persons as members of the convention to draft a con stitution for the incoming state, and 1 earnestly advise that such constitution after adoption by the convention shall bt submitted to the people of the territorj for their approval at an election In which the sole Issue shall be the merits of the proposed constitution, and If the consti tution Is defeated by popular vote means shall be provided In the enabling act for a now convention and the drafting of a new constitution. I think it vital that the is sue as to the merits of tho constitution should not be mixed up with the selection of state officers, and that no election oi state officers should be had until after the constitution has been fully approved a..d finally settled upon. Alaska. AVIth respect to the territory of Alaska, I recommend legislation which shall pro vide for the appointment by the president of a governor and also of an executive council, the members of which shall dur ing their term of office reside in the ter ritory, and which shall have legislative powers sufficient to enable it to give to the territory local laws adapted to its present growth. I strongly deprecate leg islation looking to the election of a terri torial legislature In that vast district. The lack of permanence of residence of a large part of the present population and the small number of the people who eithet permanently or temporarily reside In the district as compared with Its vast ex panse and the variety of the Interests that have to be subserved, make it altogether unfitting in my Judgment to provide for a popular election of a legislative body. The present system Is not adequate and does not furnish the character of local control that ought to be there. The only compromise it seems to me which may give needed local legislation and secure a conservative government Is the one I pro pose. Conservation of Resources. In several departments there is presented the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national re sources, and the subject Is one of such Importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be en tered upon in this Communication. For that reason I shall take an early opportu nity to send a special message to congress on the subject of the improvement of our waterways, upon the reclamation and irri gation of arid, seml-arld, and swamp lands upon the preservation of our for ests and the reforesting of suitable areas upon the reclassification of the public do main with a view of separating from agri cultural settlement mineral, coal and phosphate lands and sites belonging to the government bordering on streams suitable for the utilization of water power. Consolidation of Bureaus. I request congressional authority to en able the secretary of commerce and la bor to unite the bureaus of manufac tures and statistics. This was recom mended by a competent committee ap pointed in the previous administration ror the purpose of suggesting changes in the Interest of economy and efficiency, and Is requested by the secretary. White Slave Trade. I greatly regret to have to say that the Investigations made in the bureau of immigration and other sources of infor mation lead to the view that there is urgent necessity for additional legislation and greater executive activity to sup press the recruiting of the ranks of pros titutes from the streams of Immigration into this country—an evil which, for want of a better name, has been called the of a better name, has been called "the white slave trade." I believe it to be constitutional to forbid, under penalty, the transportation of persons for purposes of prostitution across national and state lines and by appropriating a fund of $50,000 to be used by the secre tary of commerce and labor for the em ployment of special inspectors it will be possible to bring those responsible for this trade to indictment and conviction under a federal law. 1 have thus, In a message compressed as much as the subjects will permit, re ferred to many of the legislative needs of the country, with the exceptions al ready noted. Speaking generally, the country Is In a high state of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial business expansion, and we have Just garnered a harvest unexampled in the market value of our agricultural products. The high prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming com munity, but on the other hand they mean a very considerably Increased bur den upon those classes In the community whose yearly compensation does not ex pand with the Improvements in business and the general prosperity. Various rea sons are given for the high prices. The proportionate increase in the output of gold, which today is the chief medium of exchange and Is In some respects a measure of value, furnishes a substan tial explanation of at least part of the Increase in prices. The increase in pop ulation and the more expensive mode of living of the people, which have not been accompanied by a proportionate Increase in acreage production, may furnish a fur- ther reason. It Is well to note that the increase in the cost of living is not con fined to this country, but prevails the world over, and that those who would charge Increases In prices to the existing protective tariff must meet the fact that the rise in prices has taken place almost wholly in those products nf the factory and farm In respect to which there has beep either no increase In the tariff or in many Instances a very considerable reduction. Severe on the Minister. Bishop Olmsted, of Denver, tells a Thanksgiving story Illustrative of the fact that clergymen must keep very much farther away from evil than the ordinary man. The bishop was once talking in Olmsted ville with an old fisherman about a neigh boring divine. "A very good man," the bishop said. "A good man, yes," assented the old fisherman. "He swer.rs a good bit for a preacher, though." "Swears?" ^exclaimed Bishop Olmsted, "I can't believe that. "But heerd him," said the old fisher man, obstinately. "I sat beside him at our Thanksgiving treat, you know, sir. We both of us were backing away at a turkey leg. His got away from him. It slid across the table towards me and a lot of cranberry sauce was spattered about. "I said to him, sympathetic like, for I could see he was worked up: 'These legs are damn tough, ain't they, sir?" "He answered back, quick as a flash: •Yes, George, they certainly are.' •'Now, if that ain't swearing," concluded the old fisherman, "what Is It?" Liberty vs. Groans. From Llpplncott's. A colored man from Georgia had lived in Washington but a few years when he was arrested for some slight violation of the city ordinances. Upon hearing that the negro was In jail, the secretary of the colored Y. M. C. A. secured the services of a minister t« go with him and sigh the prisoners ball bond. They reached the jail shortly before noon, and told the negro the subject of their visit. .In response to the proffered kindness he said: "Mistab Johnsing, I sho Is glad you all is gwine tab git me out, but I wants you-all to fix it so I can't git out tell late dls ebenin'." Of course the two Samaritans were somewhat taken aback by this unusual request. But a moment later they lost their breath when. In answer to the secretary's question, the Georgia negro replied in a whisper: "Weil, sah, dey's a-gittin' dinnah ready, an* dey's cookin' greens an* I sho wduld like ie git some o' dexn greens befo' I leabes dls place!" One difference between a pugilist and a champion football team la that the latter makes most ot its noise at tha close of the contest.

RUBBEB INDUSTRY IN THE BELGIAN CONGO The scene here represented is at Missumba, in the Bakuba country, in the Belgian Congo. During the collecting of the rubber, small particles of wood and hard bits of fiber get into it, and to remove these the rubber balls and twists are cut up into slices and put into sacks, which are then beaten by the native workmen with heavy sticks. "While at this work," writes the artist, "they were singing their native love songs, beating time on the rub ber with their sticks. When I made the sketch from which this drawing was done they were singing their own native version of 'Where Are You Going To, My Pretty Maid?"'—Illustrated London News.

A Kansas statute makes municipali ties liable for all damages accruing in consequence of the action of mobs within their corporate limits. Shortly after the celebration of a marriage a number of men gathered at a house where a bride and groom were stay ing, placed them In a wagon, drew It Jlaiming iy hand up and down the streets, pro their nuptials and intro ducing them to passers-by in burlesque speeches. The wagon was pulled over a child, breaking his leg. He and his mother each sued the city. In City of Cherryvale vs. Hawman, 101 Pacific Reporter, 994, the Kansas Supreme Court pronounced such a gathering a mob, remarking that the object of a charivari Is about as barbarous as the pronunciation of its name. Whatever toleration it once had has long since passed away. Even when In vogue it was often attended with violence and bloodshed. If ever such an assemblage with all its tumult and confusion was not a great provocation to those an noyed and Insulted by it, that time has gone by. Judgment against the municipality was affirmed. HARVEST SCENE PLEASES TAFT. Hanquet Hall Presented a Boner of Color and Oat dor Fragrance. "My, it's beautiful!" This simple, homely but eloquent ex clamation fell from President Taft's lips as he entered the Hall of the Doges at Davenport's for breakfast, says the Spokane Spokesman-Review. It was his first glimpse of the beau tiful banquet room in which he was to be feted by official Spokane, and the words he uttered were a spontane ous and Bincere tribute to the skill of those whose duty and pleasure it was to decorate the ball in his honor. When the President mounted the iteps leading to the banquet room he found himself, in effect, in a fragrant ipple orchard. The green branches of prolific trees, heavy with russet and crimson fruit, almost met the borse ihoe of the President's table, and at tils right in that part of the banquet hall that lies under tbe dome, golden knd red and purple grapes hung from vines twined about the pillars and trooped from the arches. Just behind President Taft, who, luring the luncheon, occupied a seat "1 of him, in an oval frame. Green vines were entwined about the picture and here and there in the vines were fast ened the presidential flag. In front of the President's table there was a great cluster of grapes, apples and pears, resting on long "runners' of scarlet gladiolus and the feathery gypsy vine. In the grape room under the dome, which is separated from the main ban quet hall by slender arches, great col umns of Shasta daisies that had been literally pulled up by the roots—the latter concealed in jars—were grouped just back of the table where the Presi dent breakfasted. Everywhere there was fruit. Every apple that hung from the boughs was luscious looking, big and polished every bunch of grapes was so solid and heavy that it seemed to tax the strength of the vine from which it hung. And the final note—the gar lands of autumn leaves, russet, red and golden, twined about the beauti ful chandeliers—made the whole pic ture seem a bit of the real outdoors, fragrant with fruit and grasses and beautiful autumn flowers.
