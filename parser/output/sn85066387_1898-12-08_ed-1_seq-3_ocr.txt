FIRE DESTROYS OIL TANKS AT LOS ANGELES Standard's Property Burned. CARELESSNESS OF A PEDDLER PROBABLY DROPPED A MATCH INTO BENZINE flames Spread So Rapidly That Only a Portion of the Books and Valuables Are Saved. Special Dispatch to The Call. LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.— The ware house of the Standard Oil Company and nine tanks of oil were destroyed this afternoon by fire. The nine tanks were Bmail sized. Four of them contained gasoline, one benzine and four linseed oil. Fortunately four l:\rge tanks con taining hundreds of thousands <Jf gallons of Oil <li<3 not burst. If the flames had reached the oil in these tanks?, one of which contained gasoline, the fire would have one of the most disastrous this city has ever known. Although E. S. Sullivan, the local manager, places the damage at only $25,000, experts say that $100,000 will not cover the loss. Little or no insurance was carried. Shortly after 3 o'clock this afternoon J. Peterson, an employe of the Stand il Company, was assisting a ped i named Stevens to fill his wagon tank with benzine. Peterson was hand ing the benzine to Stevens, who was in the v on. Suddenly Peterson heard a noise and saw that the bucket, into which be was pouring the oil from the faucet, was on fire. Peterson tried to quench t..-> flames, but they spread quickly to the benzine tank, which con tained' 7000 gallons of oil. Stevens whipped up his horse and tried to es from the names, but as he left tli" yard it was noticed that his wagon was ablaze. The lire was probably due to the i arelessness of Stevens, who had either lighted a match or had mis i a pipe. Manager Sullivan saw the burning wagon, realized the danger to the ware and rushed to close the fireproof After turning in an alarm he his attaches did their utmost to :• the books ai.d valuables. The fire spread so rapidly that only a por tion was saved before the flames reached th<- warehouse. The benzine tank had been burning for fully fifteen minutes. As soon as the names beran to lick up that build ing there was a series of explosions which caused the flames to spread quickly all around the warehouse. The smaller tanks began to melt away and the thousands of people that had been attracted by the fire were driven back by fear of an explosion of the gasoline tank. At first the flames shot brightly from >n the top of the tanks. Then ■ < <1 the dull, heavy black cloud of the oil fire. At a distance the sky s- emed to be darkened. On coming nearer, however, curving flames could be seen. Beneath the dark cloud over- head a series of fire areas seemed to a ■form and tn trace spiral curves. The warehouse was Bituated on the rfver bank between the Downey avenue Buena Vista street bridges, and between the Santa Fe and South ern Pacific tracks. The Santa Fo runs in a northeasterly direction; the South ern Pacific runs north and south. Seven Santa Fe cars w*»re burned. Four cars were laden with hay, one box car contained coal, two tank cars contained crude oil. The Soutnern Pa cific lost no cars. Later the flames reached the four bie tanks, which fortunately did not burst. The largest tank holds 400,000 gallons, hut had only 125,000 gallons in it to day. The second t;mk holds 200.000 sal lons of oil. but to-day it hold only 40. 000 gallons of gasoline. Had the flames reached the gasoline the loss to life and property would have been awful. The remaining two tanks which hold 100.000 gallons each, are practically intact. At 4:16 o'clock the fire was fairly well tinder control, but somo of the firemen ■will be left at work all night. No dam age was done to the cottag-es in the neighborhood. EMBASSADOR MUNSON'S SPEECH DENOUNCED Sentiments That Have Caused a Sensation in Official and Diplo matic Circles. PAT; IP. Pfr.

REMARKABLE VOYAGE OF THE MONADNOCK HardshipsEnduredon the Way. TOLD BY CAPTAIN WHITING WONDERFUL ENDURANCE OF THE CREW IN THE TROPICS. Successful Voyage on a Monitor, Lit tle Better Than a Raft, From San Francisco to 1 Manila. i Epeclal Dispatch to The Call. WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.— The Navy '■ Department has just made public a re ! port from Captain Whitiner. who com j manded the Monadnock on the voyage | from San Francisco to Manila, in 1 which, after tellinV of some of the ; hardships endured during the trip, pays i a well deserved compliment to the ener \ gy and ability of the officers and crew ! which made possible what was without , doubt the most remarkable voyage ever ; made by an ironclad vessel In an emer j gency. Captain Whiting's report. which ; reached the Navy Department through Admiral Dewey, contains the follow ing: U. S. S. MONADNOCK, SECOND RATE. MARIVEL.ES. P. 1., Oct. 22, 189 S. Sir: Notwithstanding the fortuitous consequence to myself attendant upon the cruise of this vessel to the relief of the Asiatic fleet at Ma nila, I should consider myself as derelict to my duty as commanding offi cer, now that the war is over, if I failed to call the attention of yourself and the department to the highly neritorious services rendered by this ship's com pany of officers and men under the most trying and difficult circumstances. The ability, couraee. zeal and endurance I shown by them in crossing the Pacific Ocean in a vessel of this typo, practically a raft with only sixteen inches freeboard in her overloaded condition, certainly de- I serves some recognition. A cruise of over 7000 miles in the tropics, in the ex cesstve temperatures, with what small i deck room there is in the ship packed I with coal, so that sleeping places and ; sleep were almost unattainable luxuries for the forty days spent at sea— all hands • upon a limited amount of fresh water, , struggling with appurtenances and en- ! glnes never designed for such overloaded service, continually breaking down and as continually being repaired, no war duty has been more onerous or more disheart-> oning. Anticipating a fight to the death with ! the enemy's heaviest force, afloat, the voy- ' ape has been for all a forlorn hope from i the beginning, recognized as such by all ; who participated, heartily joined in with out flinching, happily ending without an incident, yet only needing disaster to em phasize what I write. Continuing, Captain Whiting es- ! pecially commends the alertness of the : ,' Monadnock's executive officer. Lieu- ; ! tenant Commander C. P. Perkins; Chief : ; Engineer T. F. Burgdorff, who "stub- j bornly fought the inherent weakness of i engines designed for harbor use and j successfully forced them through such ' ! a prolonged voyage at sea," and Sur- i ; geon J. M. Steele. who carried the j i ship's company through the trying or- ! i deal without a single fatality, though j men were continually falling from heat I 1 and exhaustion. Speaking of the zealous responses ol j \ the officers and men to unusual calls : fnr duty, Captain Whiting says: They volunteered by delegation to coal ' ship by day and night at Guapn, although i nearly prostrated by the heajrand confino ment to which they were subjected, both there and while en route. Too much i j praise cannot be given the engineer's ! j force below, who were incessantly occu- ' '■ pied at all times, day and night, under the ' most arduous circumstances that can be ; , imagined on board ship in the tropics, do- j ing their utmost to keep the machinery in i < running order. That I have succeeded in safely bringing ! : this monitor so far from her intended field ! j of action in such a comparatively short ] : time, with the Nero for a consort, is ! wholly and entirely due to the mast patri otic and energetic support of this ship's '■ company of officers and men. There is no better ship's company afloat and all who can show upon their records that j they took part in the cruise of the Monadnock from San Francisco to Manila during the war with Spain deserve all the ! ; favors that the Navy Department and a I grateful country can bestow upon them j either now or in the future NORTHERN PACIFIC FXECUTES A COUP Beats the Oregon Line Into Lewiston by Laying a Track at Night. TACOMA, Dec. ".—At Lewiston, Idaho, yesterday the Northern Pacific beat the Oregon Railway and Navigation Com pany at the latter's own game. The Ore | gon Railway and Navigation Company had been piling up material for a week, ; but did little construction work. Yester day morning Lewiston found that the Northern Pacific had landed men ties and rails during the night and was rap idly laying track around the city's water front. Thfcs coup gives the Northern Pacific ; possession of the best part of the frontage on both Snako anu Clearwater rivers and puts the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company at a disadvantage in securing adequate terminals. To get into Lewision ; the Oregon Railway and Navigation Com , pany will have to build up the north side of Clearwater River, cross it below the Northern Pacific bridge and then build back on the opposite shore into town. MANY RELIGIOUS MANIACS. Four Followers of "The Wife of Christ" Now in the Insane Asylum. SACRAMENTO. Dec. 7.-The State Lu nacy Commission has on flle papers to show that within the past few days there have been four commitments from South ern California. In each of these cases the cause of insanity is given as religion and each of the patients is known to have been a disciple of an alleged "healer" who is known by her followers as Mum my Williams. This aged colored woman claims to be the wife of Christ and has created a great deal of excitement among the ne frces in the southern part of California t Js reported that one of her disciples starved himself to death.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898. ACCUSED OF HAVING ACCEPTED A BRIBE Supervisor Charles W. Garrett of Fresno County Indicted by a Grand Jury. FRESNO, Dec. 7.— Supervisor Charles W. Garrett was Indicted by the Grand Jury this morning on a charge of having received a bribe of $150 in connection with the purchase last August of a road sprinkler at a cost of $900. The true bill returned by the Grand Jury was present ed to Judge Rlsley at 10 o'clock. Then the jury returned to make fur ther Investigation into the same affair. At 4 o'clock a bench warrant was Issued on the indictment and placed In the hands of Deputy Sheriff Peck, who served it on the Supervisor shortly after the board had adjourned. Garrett was not taken by surprise; in fact, he had been informed that he had been indicted and was looking after bondsmen. His bond was fixed in the sum of $5000 by Judge Risley and he gave bail with Jeff Ames, Adolph Shields, John Kerr and Frank "Wickersham as sureties. According to the findings of the Grand Jury, Garrett received $150 as a bribe to vote for a road sprinkler for his district, which was bought for $900. It was purchased from the Hopkins Agricultural Works, of which James K. Hopkins is president. Garrett was summoned before the Grand Jury and admitted having re ceived $150 from Hopkins about a week after the purchase of the sprinkler, but claimed that he merely borrowed it and had paid $40 of the amount back. Supervisor Ward bought a sprinkler from the same firm and also bor rowed money from Mr. Hopkins; It Is understood that two more indictments on the same transaction will be returned to-morrow. The arrest of Garrett caused a big sensation in political circles and the further action of the Grand Jury is awaited with the greatest interest. 

ROMANCE OF AN ARMY HARDTACK Begins Beautifully, but Ends Sadly. LOUISA DUGAN'S GRIEF BECOMES ENGAGED TO PRIVATE ROBERT J. BROWN. Upon His Return From Cuba He Be comes an Embezzler and Flees on the Eve of His Wedding. Special Dispatch to The Call. SEDALIA, Mo., Dec. 7. — An army hardtack brought a season of happi ness and then one of grief to pretty Louise Dugan of East Sedalia, and started a romance which had a most unhappy ending last nifeht. When the war with Spain broke out, Robert J. Brown was doing well as an insurance agent in San Francisco, but he was anxious for a brush with the Dons, and joined the regular army. When his regiment passed through Sedalia last May, hundreds of pretty maidens were at the depot to wave tiny flags and cheer the boys in blue. Brown saw Miss Dugan and handed her a hardtack upon which was written his name, number of his company and regiment, with the request, "Write to me." A correspondence commenced and re sulted in an engagement. Brown was among the soldiers who ; faced shot and shell at San Juan Hill, : where he was wounded while charging ' the Spanish trenches. When he recov ; ered from his wounds he Avas honor- I ably discharged for physical disability i and then came direct to Sedalia, mak i ing his home at the Dugan residence. 1 While in the army he became a slave !to drink. He succeeded in hiding his failing from his bride to be, but it led him into using his employer's money. Knowing that his shortage with the in surance company was liable to be dis covered at any moment he fled the city at the hour his bride expected to be married to him and the wedding party waited for him in vain. It was almost midnight before Miss Dugan would be lieve that she had been deserted. Then she fainted and the guests departed. RAISED TO THE RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL i Brigadiers Guy V. Henry, U. S.

CASSIAR COUNTRY IS RICH IN GOLD Reports of Discoveries Confirmed. STAMPEDE NEXT YEAR LIKELY REMARKABLE FINDS MADE BY PROSPECTORS, Locations Kept Secret Until the For tunate Argonauts Can Provide for Themselves and Friends. Special Dispatch to The Call. 

TACOMA, Dec. 7.— Authentic news has been received at Wrangel. con firming the recent reports of new placer discoveries in the Cassiar mining country and also to the westward of Teslin, between Teslin Lake and the Atlin district. J. H. Rose of Fargo, manager of the Alaska Mining and Commercial Company, predicts at Wrangel that there will be a great stampede to the Cassiar placers next summer. Rose's company sent several men into that country this year under his direction. One of these found a stream from which in four days he alone washed nineteen ounces of gold. These diggings are reached by way of the Stickeen River and the road to Teslin Lake. Their exact location will not be made public until locations are made by the party of men whom Rose will pilot in next spring. Rose is of the opinion that a railroad will yet be built from Glf-nora to Teslin. result ing, he says, in the immediate opera tion of a number of quartz claims, upon which assessment work has been done. Just before Rose left Clenora pros pectors arrived with new/ of rich placer discoveries to the northwest of Teslin, in the direction of Lake Atlin. Several creeks yielded 10 cents and upward per pun, and gold was found from the grass roots down. Their description shows that these diggings, and the general characteris tics of the country, are similar to the Atlin district. At Glenora. in fact, there is little doubt that they are on the eastern edge of the Atlin gold belt. Several of the lucky prospectors mak ing these finds are in the employ of Frank Calbreath, a storekeeper at Glenora, and John Wright, who keeps a store at Teslin. Wright attached so much importance to the find that, de spite the lateness of the season, he abandoned his business and has gone to verify the reports. It is probable the new diggings will be best reached via Atlin Lake, in which event the in tervening country will also be explored. Rose and his mon will takp into the Cassiar district next spring modern ap pliances for developing both placer and quartz propositions. CALIFORNIA FRUIT GROWERS PROTEST Petition Against Reciprocal Agree ment With Greece Laid Before the President. WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.— Each member of the California delegation received to day from the California Fruit Growers' Association a protest against the pro posed agreement with Greece concerning fruit importations. Greece has been en deavoring for some time to reach a re ciprocal agreement which would give her currants nnd raisins certain advantages. The Zante. currant people of California are therefore protesting against the conclusion of any reciprocal agreement which would admit the raisins of Greece by the payment of a minimum duty. Senator Perkins called on tile Presi dent and Secretary of State and presented the remonstrance to-day. LOS 

ANGELES, Dec. 7.— At the regular meeting of the directors of the Chamber of Commerce to-day a resolution was adopted earnestly protesting against the negotiation of any treaty or the making of any agreement involving any change in the tariff with reference to currants or other fruits. This action was taken be cause of the reference made by President McKinley in his message, to the complaint of the Government of Greece that the duty imposed on currants of that country was unjust, the product not coming into competition with any domestic product. 

CALIFORNIA TROOPS TO COME HOME FIRST DENVER, Dec. 7.— The Rocky Mountain News prints the following telegram from Secretary Alger, dated Washington, De cember 6: "It is proposed to send regular regi ments to relieve the volunteers in Manila just as soon as transportation can be se cured. The volunteers will be returned to the United States in the order in which they left." This will bring the troops back in the following order: First California, First Oregon. First Colorado, Tenth Pennsyl vania and the Utah Battery. Advances made on furniture and pianos, with or without removal. J. Noonan., 1017-1023 Mission. LYNCH LAW IN PROSPECT AT DEL MAR Reign of Terror in the Town. DRINKING WATER POISONED CRIMES OF INCENDIARIES AND VANDALS. Citizen Ordered to Leave the Place Arms Himself and Issues a Defiance to the f Vigilantes. Special Dispatch to The Call. SAN DIEGO, Dec. 7.— Del Mar, twenty miles north of this city, is aroused over a series of depredations committed by some unknown person, and it is not improbable that a lynch ing will take place if the identity of the culprit becomes known. A vigilance committee has been organized, and Uri Bennett, prom-'-' - of the hotel that burned there yesterday morning, has been ordered to leave town within forty-eight hours. Mr. Bennett refuses to do so and defies any one to lay a hand on him. He goes about the streets armed with a Winchester, and to-day posted a notice on the postofflce door that if any one desired to serve papers on him he could do so through the post office. The excitement runs high In the town. Trouble has been brewing for months between cor*"'" factions there, and on Thanksgiving night the big tank and windmill which supplied the town with water was burned. There was no doubt that the work was that of an incendiary, and as the calamity was a public one there was talk imme diately of organizing a vigilance com mittee and driving the incendiary ouj of the town. G. W. Bennett, who owned the property, made no apparent move to learn who had done him the in jury. A night or two later the office of the Justice of the Peace was wrecked, and two days afterward a bag of strychnine was found in a barrel of water used for drinking purposes by the section men. Affairs came to a climax early yester day morning when the hotel burned with all its contents. The building was erected during the "boom" at a cost of $5000 or more, and stood in the name of Mrs. Uri Bennett, the wife of the manager and sister-in-law of George W. Bennett. The next surprise in the list of sensa tions was the notice of a committee of citizens which was served on Uri Ben nett, ordering him to leave the town within forty-eight hours. For his part Mr. Bennett procured a rifle and a belt of ammunition, and at last accounts was marching the streets of the little town defying the constables, vigilance committee and citizens generally to lay a finger on him, and declaring that he would *not leave the town until he got ready to do so. Inquiry fails to show exactly why Mr. Bennett has been selected as the un desirable citizen. He certainly did not burn the hotel, as he was in San Diego on Monday night. MORGAN ASSAILS THE NICARAGUA GOVERNMENT Continued from — lr«l Page. cessionary incidents to a corporation chartered for such great purpose." Attention is then called to the fact that the concession provides for the submission of any dispute to arbitra tion, and it is claimed that this provi sion operates to prevent any arbitrary action on the part of Nicaragua. Dwelling upon Nicaragua's course in the matter, the committee says: "How this unexampled condition is to be dealt with otherwise than by an express and determined attitude on the part of the United States is a question that carries with it the danger of seri ous embroilment in the near future. If Nicaragua is not held to the per formance of her agreement, years will elapse and many dangers will be en countered before even a start can be made toward the construction of a canal." COLOMBIA WILL GRANT EXTENSION OF TIME Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gor don Bennett. PANAMA, Colombia, Dec. 7.— 1 am In a position to state by the very highest authority that the statement from Washington to the effect that an ex tension of time has been refused to the new canal company in which to con struct the canal is absolutely false. I have just seen a dispatch from Bo gota which says the bill had passed its second reading, but Congress having been called in extraordinary session for o?ily twenty days, which time has al ready expired, the measure was laid over. Another dispatch states that in view of the paramount importance of the question the President will again con voke Congress to deal with the canal bill, when it is almost certain an ex tension of time will be granted. 

HOUSE MAY DEFEAT THE MORGAN BILL NEW YORK, Dec. 7.— The Washing ton correspondent of the Herald tele graphs: Everything is ready for the big fight over the Nicaraguan canal bill. At a special meeting of the Nica raguan Canal Committee this morning it was decided to report the Morgan bill to the Senate at once and to press it for immediate consideration. Not discouraged by the gloomy outlook in the House the friends of the mea3;:ro are combining their forces for a prompi and vigorous campaign in the Senate. They believe they will succeed, but with Speaker Reed arrayed in the opposition in the House they have almost de spaired of securing action by that body during the present session. Interviews I have had with leading members dur ing the last few days indicate that the fight for favorable action in the Hous< is hopeless. 

CLAMORING FOR INDEPENDENCE Filipinos Have Not Lost i Hope. WOULD REIMBURSE AMERICA BELIEVE THEY CAN PUB-CHASE FREEDOM. ■■■•■■ ■'-— »" ■ ''-:'■■'• ■■■■■" Transport Newport, Bearing General Miller and Staff, Casts Anchor in Manila ;; ' \ Harbor. ; }) : Special Dispatch to The Call. MANILA, Dec. 7.— The native press continues to advocate independence and reimbursement to the United States of the amount to be paid Spain for the Philippines. The Independencia thinks this course the only Just one. It in sists that the Filipinos have aided the Americans solely because they believed they were fighting for independence. The paper quotes liberally from Presi dent McKinley's last speech in Chicago to support its contention that the Americans are pledged jto give the Filipinos independence. Aguinaldo and his principal advisers fully recognize the importance of a strong protectorate in some form. One of the advisers has even ventured the assertion that if the Filipinos were granted independence in accordance with the demand of the leaders the United States would be asked to estab lish a protectorate, as otherwise the Philippines must sooner or later become the prey of a less liberal-minded coun try. This statement Is borne out by the at titude of the better class of Filipinos In the vicinity of Manila. The numer ous stories as to hostility felt and dis played on their part toward the Ameri- cans are without foundation. The United States authorities expect on the part of the natives a peaceful accept ance of the inevitable. The United States transport New port, bearing General Miller and staff and the First Battalion of the Twen tieth Kansas Regiment, with the Wyoming Light Battery, which left San Francisco on November 8, arrived to-day, closely following the City of Puebla, which arrived yesterday with Lieutenant Colonel Childers, twenty five officers and COO men, including five companies of the First Tennessee, Troop A of the Nevada Volunteer Cav alry, a detachment of recruits for the Twenty-third Infantry and a detach ment for the California Heavy Artil lery. To provide for the accommodation of these newcomers will necessitate the transfer of a number of United States troops outside the limits of the city proper. SHERMAN OPPOSES COLONIAL POLICY Ex-Senator's Letter to the Anti linperialist League of Boston. BOSTON, Dec. 7.— At a meeting of the Anti-Imperialist League executive committee to-day, a letter was read from John Sherman, saying: My hope is that the Senate of the United States will reject the treaty and leave the people of the Islands free from the shackles of Spain and the distant domina tion of the United States. I sympathize with Aguinaldo in his ambition to found a republic in the China Sea near the equator, and hope he may become the v ashington of a new nation, absolutely free from European and American in fluence. Bishop Potter of New York and James G. Carter of New York were added to the list of vice presidents of the league. More than 500 petitions pro testing against an imperialistic policy regarding Spain's conquered posses sions have been received at the Wash ington and Boston offices of the league, each petition bearing many signatures.' It was decided to-day to begin at once presenting the petitions to the Senate.
