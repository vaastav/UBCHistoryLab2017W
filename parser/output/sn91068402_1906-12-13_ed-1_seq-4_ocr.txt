THE HENDEHSON GOLD L.EAF THURSDAY, DECEMBER 13 ,1906. i - i r Mi ii' P RESIDENT'S M ESSAG E President Roosevelt iu his annual message again urge the enactment of h law prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign funds. He also urges the passage of the measure conferring upon the government the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. Continuing, the president tuny: I cannot tM strongly urge the pas sage of the bill in question. A failure to pans it will result in seriously ham pering the sovernnwiit in it effort to i.btain jusli.e, especially against wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong, and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for wagewurkers who are not them selves able effectively to contest a case where the Judgment of an inferior court has been against them. I have specifically In view a recent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees without remedy for viola tion of a certain so called labor statute. The importance of enacting into law the particular bill i i question Is fur ther increased by tin- fact that the gov ernment bus now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law in those trust and Interstate commerce uses where such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. Proper I uf Injunction, lu my Inst message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of ap plying injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts, in which case, of course, the legislation would be ineffective. More over, I believe It would be wrong alto gether to prohibit the use of injunc tions. It is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law, and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no im pairment of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way jtossible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should le provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. Airalnut Lyac-hla-. I call your attention and the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us and, above all, to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up now in one part ot out country, now in another. Each sec tion north, south, east or west, has its own faults. No section can with wisdom spend its time jeering at the f:uilts of another section. It should be busv trying to amend its own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption it is necessary to have an .lunltinipil miblic conscience and to supplement Ihis b whatever legisla tioii will add spec-' and certainty m ihe execution of th law. Wbeu we deal with lynching even more Is neces sary. A great many white men are lynched, but ihe clinic is peculiarly frequent in res-pec t to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the hideous crime of rape, the most abominable In all the category of crimes, even worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what It feeds upon, aud when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the pucrc uf their operations and lynch for many oth-r kinds of crimes, so that Iwo-thirds i the lytichiues are not for ran.- ::i all. while a considerable nri' i ti.!i .l the individuals lynched are iuui cent of all crime. There is i ui hi safe rule in dealing with lia.-L hum as with white men It it- lh suue rule that must be ap ulied in dealing with rich men and poor men that is. 1o treat each man. whatever his col r. his creed or his so cial position, with even handed justice tin his real worth as a man. White people owe it quite as mu ti to them selves as to the colored race to treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves such treatment. There is no question of social equality or negro domination Involved. In my judgment, the crime of rape should always be puuished with death as is the case with murder. Assault with intent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court, and provision should be made by which the punish ment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense. No more shortsighted policy can be imagined than in the fancied Interest of one class to prevent the education of another class. The white man, if he is wise, will decline to allow the uegroes in a mass to grow to man hood and womanhood without educa tion. "Preachers of Mere Dlscamteat." In dealing with both labor and cap ital, with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important to re member than aught else, and that is the intiuite harm done by preachers of mere discontent These are the men who seek to excite a violent class ha tred a pi Inst all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ments for the iH'tter control of corpora tions and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim is to in flame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogues aud foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to as sociate themselves with those working for a genuine reform in governmental aud socir.l methods and sometimes mas querade as such reformers. In reality they are the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors of sensational slander in newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies of all men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what Is bad iu our social and governmental condi tions. Corruption is never so rife as in com Bnunities where the demagogue and the agitator bear full sway, because in such communities all moral bands be come loosened, and hysteria and sensa tionalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus produced men are sure in the end to turn toward nay leader who can restore order, and the their relief at being free from the in tolerable burdens of class hatred, vio lence and demagogy is such that they cannot for some time be aroused to in dignation against misdeeds by men of wealth, so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were In part responsible for the original out break. The one hope for success for oar people lies in a resolute and fear less but sane and cool headed advance along the path marked out last year by this very congress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled Into fol lowing either that base creature who appeals and panders to the lowest in stincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or that other creature, equally base, but no baser, who in a spirit of greed or to accumulate or add to an already huge fortune seeks to exploit bis fellow Americans with callous dis- i regard to their welfare of soul ana body. The man who debauches others In order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit, and when hatred is sown tne crop wnicn springs only be evil. The plain people who think the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently bv their neighbors owe it to them selves to remember that the most dam aging blow that can be given popular government is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Railroad Employers Hours. I call vour attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. The measure Is a very mcder ate one. and I can conceive of no seri ous objection to it. Indeed, so far as it is in our power, it should lx our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general In troduction of an eight hour day. There are industries In which it Is not pos sible that the hours of labor should be reduced, just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, If in the tropics, so situated that there Is no analogy between their needs and our? In this matter. On the isthmus of Panama, for Instance, the condi tions are in every way so different from what they are bore that an eight hour day would be absurd, just as it is absurd, so far as the isthmus is con cerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by alien black .men or by alien yellow men. But the wiitr'-workers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint It should be our object to do what we can in the direc tion of securing the general observance of an eight hour day. Let me again urge that the congress provide for a thorough investigation of the conditions of child labor and of the labor of women In the United States. The horrors incident to the employment of young children in fac tories or at work anywhere nre n blot on our civilization. In spile of all precautions exercised bj -employers there are unavoidable ac- cidents and oven deaths involved in nearly every line of business connect- , ea Willi tne mecnanic arts, u is a great social injustice to compel the em ployee, or, rather, the family of the killed or disabled victim, to bear the entire burden of such an inevitable sacrifice. In other words, society shirks i its duty by laying the whole, cost on from what may be called the legiti mate risks of the trade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due in any line of Industry to the actual conditions un der which that industry is carried on should be paid by that portion of the community for the benefit of which the Industry is carried on-that is, Dy those who profit by the industry. If . as 4ills, ,,,,.,. j mx iUSi ,-areful study in the entire trade risk Is placed upon the . oro,- xl,vt the ieopIe may become fa employer, be will promptly and prop- i m-jia, with v hat is proposed to be erly add it to the legitimate cost of pro- , done, may clearly see the necessity of ductlon aud assess it proportionately j proceeding with wisdom and self re upon the consumers of his commodity, j straint and may make up their minds It Is therefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire "risk of a trade" upon the employer. Capital and Labor Disputes. Records show that during the twen ty years from Jan. 1. 1881. to rec. Z. 1900. there were strikes affecting 117', 509 establishments, and 0,105,01)4 em ployees were thrown out of employ ment. During the same period there were 1,005 lockouts, involving nearly These strikes and lockouts involved an estimated loss to employees of $307, 000.000 and to employers of $143,000. 000, a total of $450,000,000. The public suffered directly and indirectly prob ably as great additional loss. Many -of these strikes and lockouts wouM not have occurred had the par ties to tne dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced body representing the nation and. face to face, state the reasons for their con- This Trai Par I mA purchases Uai LUaU enable me to make prices same as factory cost.

The exercise of a judicial spirit by u disinterested body repre senting t!ie fet .nil government, such as would Ik; provided by a commission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create an atmosphere of friend liness aud conciliation between con tending parties. Control of Corporations. It cannot too often le repeated that fxpericice litis conclusively shown the impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but ineffective chaos iu th way ot dealing with the great corporations winch do not oper ate exclusively within the limits of any one state. In some method, wheth er by a nati n:il license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, aud that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great conoratiou: a control that will, among other things, prevent the evils of ex cessive overcapitalization and that will compel the disclosure by each big cor poration of its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether own ed directly or through subsidiary or affiliated coviwrations. This will tend to put n stop to the securing of inor dinate profits by favored individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders or the wage workers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to sec that it results in no harm to the people. Combination of capital, like combina tion of ktbor. is a necessary element of our present industrial system. It is not possible completely to prevent it and if it were possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try to prevent all combina tion, but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their injuring the pu lie or existing in such , form as inevitably to threaten injury, j for the mere fact that a combination l has secured practically complete con- j trol of a uecessary of life would under i any circumstances show that such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to the public interest. It Is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid all combinations instead of sharply discriminating between those combinations which do good and those combinations which do evil. Re bates, lor instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers (as was shown in the investigation of the Standard Oil company and as has been shown since hy the investigation of the tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the initiative of big railroads. Often rail roads would like to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining improper advantages at th- expense of small shippers ant' of the cr-a-.-ral pubiic. Such a combinj - ! :. ........ Kn Inn. )(. ,,-rued to railroads to ' . , , , the mter. ! staie commerce commission and were j published. With these two conditions complied' with it is inijfossible to see ! what harm such a combination could ! io to th- public at largo. Inheritance ami Income Tax. Tin- national government has long derived it chief revenue from a tariff on imports and from an internal or ex cise tax. In addition to these, there is every reason why, wlien next our sys- ; tern of taxation is revised, the national j gover'iiDci rhould impose-a graduated i inherit a ii .-' tax and, if possible, a grad i uated income tax. , ull W4 ;lwnre tnat such u subject just how far they are willing to go in the matter, while only trained legisla tors can work out the project iu neces sary detail. But I feel that in the near futvre our national legislators should enact a law providing for a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily in creasing rate of duty should be put upon nil moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest or devise to any individual or corporation. There can be no question of the ethical pro- mining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritance should be received. As the law now stands it Is tmdoubt edly difficult to devise a national In come tax which shall be constitutional. But whether it is absolutely Impossible Is another question, and if possible it is most certainly desirable. The first purely income tax law was passed by the congress in 1801. but the most im portant law dealing with the subject ! thnt nf 1S04 Thia th court held to be unconstitutional Arrived With 7T JBBsl Slimes' T.

It is the law of the land and of course is accepted as such and loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Xeverthe!es the - hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole in coming to a -conclusion, when considered to gether with previous decisions on the subje-t. may perhaps Indicate the pos sibility of devNhig a constitutional in come tax law which shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. Tho difficulty of amending the constitution Is so great that only real necessity can justify a resort thereto. , Every effort should be mane in dealing with this subject as with the subject of the proper control by the national govern ment over the use of corporate wealth in interstate business, to devise legis lation which without such action shall attain the desired end, but if this falls there will ultimately be no alternative to a constitutional amendment, v Industrial Training;. Our Industrial development depends largely upon technical education. In cluding in this term all industrial edu cation, from that which fits a man to be a good uicvhanie, a good carpenter or blacksmith to that vhicb fits a man to do the greate-r engineering feat. The skilled uiecha!::c. the skilled work man, can best become such by tech nical industrial education. The far roachlng usefulness of institute, of technology and schools of mines'.or ol engineering now universally ae knowledge;!, nnd no less far reaching is the effect-of a good -building or me- chi-nical trades school, a textile or watchmaking or engraving school. In every possible way we should help the wapeworker wLo toils with his hands juuI who must (we hope in a constantly increasing measure) also toil with his brain. Under the constitu tion tiie national legislature can do but little of direct importance for his wel fare save where he is engaged in work w hich permits it to act under the In terstate commerce clause of the consti tution, and this is one reason why I so earnestly hope that both the legis lative and judicial branches of the gov ernment will construe this clause of the constitution in the broadest possi ble manner. Tlie Farmer. The only othf r persons whose wel fare is as vital to the welfare of the whole country a a is the welfare of the wageworkers are the tillers of the soil, the farmers. Several factors must co-operate in the improvement of the farmer's con dition, lie must have the" chance to be educated in the widest vpossible flense. In the sense which keeps ever in view the intimate relationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. Organizat' u has become necessary in the business world, and it has ac complished much for good in the world of labor. It is no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement I good in itself and is capable of a well nigh infinite fur ther extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimate business. Tlie benefits to be derived by the as sociation of farmers for mutual ad vantage are partly economic and part ly sociological. Irrigation and Forest Preservation. Much is now being done for the states of the Itocky mountains and great plains through, the development of the national policy of irrigation and forest preservation. " Nongovernment policy for the betterment of our inter nal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. Divorf Legislation. I am well aware of how difficult it Is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless, i:i 'my judgment, the whole question of marriage and di vorce should be relegated to the au thority of the national congress. The change would be good from every standpoint. In particular it would be good because it would confer on the congress the power at once to deal radically and efficiently with iolygamy, and this should be done whether or not marriage and divorce are dealt with. It i neither safe nor proper te leave the qtiestlon of polygamy to be dealt with by the several states. Merchant Marine. Let me once again call the attention of the congress to two subjects con cerning which I have frequently be fore communicated with them. One ii the question of developing American shipping. I trust that a law embody ?ng in substance the views or a major part of the views expressed in the re port on this subject laid before the house at its last session will be passed. It seems to me that the proposed meas ure is as nearly unobjectionable as any can be. Fine FORNHDRE, NOVELTIES, &c.

I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aid- ins the enormous business develop ment of the country, and within ten i years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating that additional leg islation is r.cvrled. The recurrence of each crop see.son emphasir.es the de fects of the present laws. There must soon le a revision of them, because to lenve them as they are means to in cur liability of business disaster. Since your body Adjourned there has been a fluctuation Ir the Interest on call money from - per cent to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary or' the treasury had to step in aud by wise action put a stop to' the most viol.'at period of oscillation. I d- not press any especial plan. Va rious plans have recently been pro posed by expert committees of bank era. Amoi g the plans which are possi bly feasible nnd which certainly should receive your consideration is that re peatedly brought to your attention by the present secretary of the treasury, the essential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan, national banks should be permitted to issue a specified propor tion of their capital iu notes of a given kind, the issue to be- taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted iu legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional prof Its, but to meet the emergency present td by times of stringency. I do not say that this Is the right sys tem. I only advance It to emphasize my belief that there Is need for the adoption of some system which shall be automatic and open to all sound ban&3 so as to avoid all possibility of discrimination and favoritism. The law should be amended so a specifically to provide that the funds derived from customs duties may bf treated by the secretary of the treas ury as he treats funds obtained under tli3 internal revenue laws. Thera thottld be a considerable increase in bills of small denominations. Permis sion should be given banks, if necessa-t ry under settled restrictions, to retiro their circulation to a larger amount than three millions a month. Oar Oatlyins Possessions. I most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or else abso lute free trade in Philippine products will become a law. No harm will com to any American industry, and, while there will be some small but real mate rial benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit will come by the showing mad as to our purpose to do all iu our power for their welfare. Porto Mean Affairs. American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan, in Porto Rico, should be dredged and improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. Hawaii. The needs of Hawaii are peculiar. Every aid should be given the islands, and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the lines of a com munity of small freeholders, not of great planters with cooly tilled es tates. Alaska. Alaska's needs have been partially met, but there must be a complete re organization of the governmental sys tem, as I have before indicated to you. I ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow citizens who dwell on the shores of Puget sound with character istic energy are arranging to hold in Seattle tne Alaska-xuitou-i'acinc ex position. This exposition in its pur poses and scope should appeal not only to the people of the Pacific slope, but to the people of the United States at large. RilEhts of Aliens. Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with justice and good will all immigrants who come here, under the law. Whether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or gentile, whether they come from England or Germany, Russia. Japan or Italy, mat ters nothing. All we have a right to question Is the man's conduct If he is honest and upright in his dealings with his neighbor and with the state, then he is entitled to respect and good treatment. Especially do we need to remember our duty to the stranger within our gates. It is the sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against or in any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and who is con wniture JOS. C. ducting himself properly. To remem ber this Is incumbent on every Amer ican citizen, and it is of course pecul iarly incumbent on every government official, whether of the nation or of the several states. I am prompted to say this by tho attitude of hostility here and there as sumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility is sporadic and is limited to a very few places. Never theless it is most discreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught with the gravest consequences to the nation. I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would nsk fair treatment for Ger mans or Englishmen, Frenchmen, Rus sians or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity and civilization. I ask it as due to ourselves, lecause we must act uprightly toward all men. I recom mend to the congress that an act be passed specificallj- providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrass ments attending the performance of our international obligations is the fact that the statutes of the United States are entirely inadequate. They fail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through Unit ed States courts and by tbe use of the army and navy, to protect aliens In the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and add ed to as to enable the president, acting for the United States government, which Is responsible in our interna tional relations, to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties. The Cabas Matter. Last August an insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grew evi dent that the existing Cuban govern ment was iowerless to quell. Thanks to the preparedness of our navy, I was able immediately to send enough ships to Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless, and I fur thermore dispatched to Cuba the sec retary of "war ami the assistant secre-tarj- of state in order that they might grapple with the situation on the ground. In accordance with the so called riatt amendment, which was embod ied in the constitution of Cuba. I there upon proclaimed a provisional govern ment for the island, the secretary of war acting as provisional governor un til he could be replaced by Mr. Magoon, the late minister to Panama and gov ernor of the canal zone on tho isthmus. Troops were sent io support them and to relieve the navy, the expedition be ing handled with most satisfactory speed and efficiency. Peace has come in the island, and the harvesting of the sugar cane crop, the great crop of the island, is about to proceed. When the election has been held and the new government inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashion the provisional government will come to an end. The United States wishes nothing of Cuba except that it shall prosper mor ally and materially and wishes nothing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce and if the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed on the island it is absolutely out of the question that the island should continue independent. and the United States, which has as sumed the sponsorship before the civ ilized world for Cuba's career as a na tion, would again have to intervene and to see that the government was managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The Rio Conference. The second international conference of American republics, held in Mexi co in the years 1901-02, provided for the holding of the third conference within five years and committed the fixing of the time and place and the arrangements for the conference to the governing board of the bureau of American republics, composed of the i representatives of all the American nations in Washington. That board discharged the duty imposed upon it with marked fidelity and pains taking care, and upon the courteous invitation of the United States of Bra-' i zll the conference was held at Rio de J Janeiro, continuing from the 23d of j July to the 20th of Ajigust last. Many subjects of common interest to, all the American nations were discussed by the conference, and the conclusions reached, embodied in a series ef reso lutions and proposed conventions, will be laid before you upon the coming of the final report of the American dale gates.
