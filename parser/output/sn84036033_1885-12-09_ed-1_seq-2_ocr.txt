the PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. eont mplate a nanr diKham aid (ha army a prohtable riddance. After one term of service a reenliatment would be quite apt to sec lire a contented recruit an a good soldier. The acting JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL REPORTS that the number of trials by general court» martial during the year was 2 828 anr that 1.185 trials took place before gkrrri son and regimental courts martial? Tht suggestion that, probably more than halfo' the army have been tried for offenses great and small, in one year may well arrest at tention. Of course many of these triale before the garrison and regimental courts martial were for offences almost frivolous ami there should, I think, be a way devised to dispose of these in a more summarv and less inconvenient manner tha# bv court martial. some of the proceedings of the courts martial which I have had occasion to examine, present the ideas of justice « Inch generally prevail in these tribunals J am satisfied that they Bhould be much re formed, if the honor and the honesty of the army and na vy are by their instru mentality to be vindicated and protected. 

COAST DEEE.N8ES. The board on fortifications or other de fenses. appointed in pursuance of the pro rr^ I«« 0 ,n *, re88 a i , p ro ' , ed Mart h da, 188o. will in a short time ore sent their report, and it is hoped that this may greatly aid the legislation so neces aarv t- remedy the present defenseless condition of our sea coast. The work of the signal service has been prosecuted j during the last year with re aulrs of I .creasing benefit to the country The held of instructions has been enlarged «,t!i a view of adding to its usefulness. The number <d stations in operation on June 3>Mh, 188o. was 489. Telegraphic reports are received daily from 160 sta tions; reports are also received from 75 Canadian stations; 375 volunteer observ ers; 52 army surgeons at military posts and 333 foreign stations. The expense of the service during the fiscal year, after de ducting the receipts for military telegraph lines, was $797,592 97. In view of the fact referred to by the Secretary of War that the work of this service ordinarily is of a scientific nature aud the further fact that it is 

ASSUMING LARGER PROPORTIONS constantly, and becoming more and more iinsuited to fixed rules which must govern the army, I am inclined to agree with him in the opinion that it Bhould be separately established. If this is done the scope and extent of its operations should as nearlyas possible be definitely prescribed by law. and always capable of exact ascertain ment. The military academy of West Point is reported as being in a high state of efficiency and well equipped for the satisfactory ac complishment of the purposes of its mainte nance. The fact that the class which gradu ates next year is an unusually large one has constrained me to decline to make ap pointments to second lieutenancies in the army from civil life, so that such vacancies as exist in these places may be reserved for such graduates, and yet it is not probable that there will he euough vacancies to pro vide positions for them all when they leave the military school. Under the prevailing law and usage those not thus assigned to duty never actively enter the military ser vice. It is suggested that the law on this subject be changed so that such of these ybung men as are not at once assigned to duty after graduation may be retained as second lieu tenants in the army if they desire it, sub ject to assignment when opportunity oc curs, under the proper rules as to priority of selection. The expenditures on account of the military academy for the last fiscal year, exclusive of the sum taken for this purpose from the appropriations for the support of the army, were $290,712.07. PRIVATE LOSSES. The act approved March 3, 1885, de signed to compensate officers and enlisted men for the loss of private property while in the service of the United States is so in definite in its terms, and admits so many claims, the adjustment of which could not have been contemplated, that if it is to re main on the statute book it needs amend ments. BRIDGING STREAMS. There should be a general law of Congress prohibiting the construction of bridges over navigable waters in such a manner as to obstruct navigation, with provisions for preventing the same. It seems that under existing statutes the ^Government cannot intervene to prevent such a con struction when entered upon without itB consent; though when such consent io aeked and granted upon such condition, it is clear. Thus it is represented that while the offi cers of the Government are with great care guarding against the obstructions of navi gation by a bridge across the Mississippi river at St. Paul, a large pier for a bridge has been built just below the place directly in the navigable channel of the river. If such things are to be permitted a strong argument is presented against the^ appro priation of large sums of money to improve the navigation of thi3 and other important highways of commerce THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Navy gives a history of the operations of his de partment, and the present condition of the work committed tohischarge. Hedetailsin fufi the course pursued by him to protect the rights of the Government in respect of cer tain vessels unfinished at the time of his accession to office, and also concerning the dispatch boat "Dolphin," claimed to be completed and waiting the acceptance of the department. No one can fail to see from the recital contained in this report that only the application of business principles has been insisted upon in the treatment of these subjects, and that what ever controversy has arisen was caused by the exactioti on the part of the depart ment of contract obligations, as they were legally construed in the case of the "Dol phiu.'" with entire justness to the con tractor. An agreement has been entered into providing for the ascertainment by a, judicial inquiry of the complete or partial comp iance with the contract in her construction, and further providing for the assessment of any damages to which the Government may be entitled on account of a partial failure to perform such contract, or the paymen thesumstill remaining unpaid upon h^rpnee in ease a full performance is adjudged. The contractor; by reason of his failure n* bus» ness, being unable to complete the other turee vessels, they were taken possession of by the Government in

POSTAL AFFAHtp. . ;ïï e , a ^ ai r® of the postal service are ex hibited by the report of the Postnmster General, which will be laid before you. The postal revenue, whose rates of gain upon the rising prosperity ofl 882 and 1883out Htnpoed the increasing expense of our growing service was checked by the reduc tion in the rate of letter postage, which took effect with the beginning of October in the latter year, and it was diminished dur ing the two past fiscal years $2,790 000 in ero!: r ;w l '? r - i0n 1 ,° f *2.270,000 in 1884 to $o20,000 m 1885. The natural growth and development have in the meantime in creased the expenditure resulting in a de ficiency in the revenue to the expense of the department of $5.250.000 for the year 1884 and $8,333,000 in the last fiscal year. The anticipated and natural revival of the revende has been op pressed and retarded by the unfavorable business condition of the country, of which the postal service is a faithful 'indicator. I he gratifying fact • is shown, however, by the report that ojir returning prosperity is marked by a gain of Saso.ooO in the reve nue of the latter half of the last year over the corresponding period of the preceding year. Tbechange in the weight of fist-class matter which may be carried for a single rate of postage from a half-ounce to an ounce, and the reduction by one-half of the rate of newspaper postage, which under re cent legislation begun with the current ye ir, will operate to restrain the augmen tation of the receipts, which otherwise might have been expected to such a degree that the scn.le of expense may gain upon the revenue and cause an increased de ficiency to be shown at its close. Yet, after no long period of re-awakened pros perity, by proper economy, it is confi dently anticipated that even the present low rates, now as favorable as any country affords, will be adequate to sustain THE 

COST OF THE SERVICE. The operation of the Postoffice Depart ment is for the convenience and benefit of the people, and the methods by which they pay the charges of this useful arm of their public service, so that it be just and im partial, is of less importance to them than the economical expenditure of the means they provide for its maintenance, and the due improvement of its agencies, that they may enjoy its highest usefulness. A proper attention hae been directed to the preven tion of waste or exterva.gance, and good results appear from the report to have al ready been accomplished. I approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-Gen eral to reduce the charges for domestic money orders of $5 and less from 8 to 5* cents. This change will mateir ally aid those of our people who. most of all, avail themselves of this instrumentality, but to whom the element of cheapness is of ' the greatest importance. With this reduction the sys tern would still remain self-supporting. The free delivery system has been extended to nineteen additiona 1 cities during the .year, and 178 now enjoy its conveniences. Experience has commended it to those who enjoy its benefits, and a further enlargement of its facilities is due to other communities to which it is adapted. In the cities where it has been established, taken together, the local postage exceeds its maintenance by nearly $1,300,000. The limit to which the system is now „fined by law has been nearly reached, a:..x the reasons given justify its extension, which is proposed. It was decided, with my approbation, after a sufficient examination, to be inexpedient for the Postoffice Department to contract for CARRYING OUR FOREIGN MAILS under the additional authority given by the last Congress. The amount limited was inadquate to pay all within the pur view of the law the full rate of 50 cents per mile, and it would have been unjust and unwise to have given it to some and denied it to others, nor could the contracts have been let under the law to all at a rate to propriation without such practical pre-ar rangement of terms as would have violated it. The rate of sea and inland oostage which was proffered under another st tute clearlv appears to be a fair compensation for the desired service, being three times the price necessary to secure transportation by other vessels upon any route and muchbe yon . the charges made to private persons for services not less burdensome. Some of the steamship companies, upon the refusal of the Postmaster General to attempt, by the means provided, the distribution of the su in appropriated as an extra compensa tion, withdrew the services of their vessels, and thereby occasioned slight inconven ience, though no considerable injury. The ails have been dispatched by other means. Whatever ma, be thought of the policy of subsidizing any line of public conveyance or travel I am satisfied that it should not be done under cover of an expenditure in cident to the administration of a depart ment, nor should there be any uncertainty as to the recipients of the subsidy or any discretion left to an executive offner as to its distribution. If such gifts of public money are to be made for the purpose of AIDING ANY ENTERPRISE in the supposed interest of the public. I have brought the aggregate within the ap cannot but think that the amount to £ paid and the beneficiary might better be determined by Congress than by any other might — - an by The international congress of dele gates from the postal Union countries con vened^in Lisbon, in Portugal in February last and after a session of some weeks the delegates signed a convention amendatory of the present Postal Union convention in some particulars, designed to advance its ourposes.

The message directs that the powers and func tions of the Commissioners should be Btrictly defined. THE 

LAND LAWS. The message recommends the repeal and modification of certain of the land laws, and deprecates the filling of large tracts into the bands of syndicates for specula tion. The President urges that trans-con tinental roads be held to strict account ability in the matter of fheir grants. The message cites that in July, 1885, there were 345,125 persons borne upon the pension rolls, an increase during ten years of 110,000 persons. He recommends that care be taken to cleanse the rolls from any fraudulent personages. Utah's polygamy. In the Territory of Utah the law of the United States, passed for the suppression of polygamy, has been energetically and faithfully executed during the past year, with measurably good results. A number of convictions have been secured for unlaw ful cohabitation, and in some cases the pleas of gu ilty have been entered, and slight punishment imposed upon a promise by accused that they would not again offend against the law nor advise, counsel, aid or abet in any way its violation by others. The Utah Commissioners express the opin ions, based upon such information as they are able to obtain, that but few polyga mous marriages have taken place in the Territory during the last year. They further report that while there connot be found upon the registration lists of voters the name of a man actually guilty of polygamy, and while none of that class are holding office, yet at the last election in the Territory all the officers elected except in one county were men who though not actually living in the practice of polygan.^., ( *» u.. trine of polygamous marriage as a di vine of revelation, and a law higher and more binding upon the conscience than any human law. local or National. Thus is the strange spectacle presented of a commu nity protected by a Republican form of government, to which they owe allegiance, sustaining by their suffrage a principle and a belief which seta at naught that obligation of ab solute obedience to the law of the land which lies at the foundation of Republican institutions. The strength, the perpetuity and the destiny of the Nation rest upon our homes, established by the law of God, guarded by parental care, regulated by parental authority and sanctified by par ental love. These are not the homes of polygamy. The motheis of our land who rule the Nation, as they would the charac ters and guide the actions of their sons, live according to God's holy ordinance, and each, pure and happy in the exclusive love of the father of her children, sheds the warm light of true womanhood, un perverted and unpolluted, upon all within her pure and wholesome family circle. These are not the cheerless, crushed and unwomanly mothers of polygamy. The fathers of our families are the besc citi zens of the Republic. Wife and children are sources of patriotism, and conjugal and parental affection beget devotion to the country. The man who 

UNUEFILEO WITH PLURAL MARRIAGE, is surrounded in his single home with his wife and children, has a state in the country which inspires him with respect for its laws and courage for its defense. These are not the fathers of polygamous families. There is no feature of this prac tice or the system which sanctions it which is not opposed to all that is of value in our institutions. There should be no relaxation in the firm but just execution of the law now in operation, and I should be glad to approve such further discreet leg islation as will rid this country of this blot upon its fame. CIVIL SERVICE. Devoted to the civil service question the President says : ''I am inclined to think that there is no sentiment more general in the minds of the people of our country than the conviction of the correctness of the principle upon which the law enforcing civil service reform is based." He reiterates his former expressed views on the subject and says: 'I venture to hope that we never shall again be remitted to the system which distributes public positions purely as a reward for partisan service. Doubts may well be entertained whether our Gov ernment could survive the strain of a con tinuance of this system, which, upon every change of administration, inspires an immense army of claimants for office to lay siege to the patronage of the Govern ment, engrossing the time of public officers filling the air with the tumult of their dis content. The functions of the Presidential ««Sice has caused a public anxiety and a i-ust demand that a recurrence of such a condition of affairs should not be per mitted. A 

CLOSING ADMONITION. In conclusion I commend to the wise care and thoughtful attention of Congress the needs and welfare of an intelligent Nation. To subordinate these to the narrow advan tages of partisanship or to the accomplish ments of selfish aims is to violate the peo ple's trust and to betray the people s interests. But an individual sense of re sponsibility on the part of each of us and a stern determination to perform our duty well must give us place among those who have added in their day and generation to the glorv and prosperity of our beloved 1 and- * Grover Cleveland.

INDIAN AFFAIRS. A Review of the Yellowstone Park, With a Request for Large Appropriations. In his annual report to the President, L. Q. C. Lamar, Secretary of the Interior, opens the document by a somewhat lengthy consideration of the Indian Bureau, pre facing it by the statement that ''whilst- the exhibit the Indian Commissioner makes of the condition of various Indian tribes and bands within the limit of our country does not show a result commensurate with the efforts and expenditures in their behalf, it makes manifest a general state of peace and order and considerable progress in the mass of this dependent and helpless peo ple." Then follows the details (already published) of the transfer of the Apaches on the San Carlos reservation, in Arizona, to the War Department, adding that the arrangement did not prove as satisfactory as expected, although an improvement on the old system. He gives an account of the several outbreaks, and adds : "The «commendation of the Commis sioner of Indian Affairs that the less guilty of the rebellious Chiricahuas should be transported to an island in the Pacific ocean, as a penal colory, to earn their own living by fishing, stock-raising, etc., or sent to the military prison at Fort Leaven worth, merits consideration. They cer tainly should be removed during the com ing winter to some place where they can be more securely guarded." In referring to the Southern Utes and »Heir rleoredations he says: "These Indi ans are malting very nt-tu, ?Br( ,oa ,Thev are not disposed to till the soil, and if they were the land on their reservation offers many embarrassments, as much of it is rugged and requires irrigation." The re commendation is made that they be trans ferred to the Indian Territory, or to the Ute reservation in Utah, where there is a great deal of better land. During the year 954 patents in severalty have been issued to the Omaha Indians in Nebraska, under a previous agreement. 

INDIAN SCHOOL8 AND LEASES. After referring in detail to the various other tribes the Secretary comes to the question of Indian schools, and gives the following brief recapitulation concerning them : Kind of schools. No. of schools. Capacity. Average at'dance Cost. Day-schools........... Boa ridng-schools ... Training schools*... Contract schools ....

The money paid therefor should be handled by the officers of the Government, and used for the support of the Indians and their advancement in civilization. With my con victions I cannot recommend such legisla tion. It is in direct contravention of the pol icy of keeping the Indian reservations free from the settlements of white men—a policy which, in my opinion, should be more rig idly enforced." It was found that these leases had closed the old and established cattle trails from Texas north, and it was necessary to in struct the military to open them. RAILROAD RIGHT OF WAY. In referring to the passage of the Utah & Northern Railway through the Fort Hall Reservation, in Idaho, the report says: "The road isin operation,usingand occupying over 2,126 acres of land within the reservation for right of- way and station grounds with out having mai le any compensation to the Indians therefor. This matter was brought to the attention o f both Houses of Con gress by my predecessor, Mr. Secretary Tel ler, who stated 'it is not presumed by this Department that the law of Congress granting the right of way to the Utah and Northern Railway Company was intended to authorize the construction of their road across the lands of these Indians without oouu.ensation therefor.' No legislation Das been had on the subject." INDIAN ESTATES. The cost of the Indian service in direct appropriations is estimated to have aver aged $3,870,629 since the year 1832, and now is more than $6,000,000, having reached as high as$7,000,000. The principal possessions of these "do mestic dependent nations," with which this Department has to deal, is the land owned bv them. But a number of the tribes have funds invested and other moneys belonging to them, and have also annuities secured to them by treaty stipulations. Estimating the total area of their reservations as given at $1 per acre, the value of the es tate owned,- held and occupied^ by the In dians is, in round numbers, $134,000.000. And to this should be added other invested and uninvested funds amounting to seven teen millions, and other lhnds on the mar ket, but not yet sold or paid for, making a total of $152,000,000 in round numbers. This does not include the annuities, which, on account of the uncertainty and indefi niteuess of some of them, cannot be accu rately calculated beyond each year; nor does it embrace the value of other prop erty iu ponies, sheep, cattle, industrial im plements etc. After giving this series of estimates the Secretary adds that the above is an expen sive showing when it is taken into consid eration that there are only 260,000 In dians in the country. The Indian problem could easily be solved by conferring upon them the rights of citizenship, absorbing them as were the slaves, but this is not ap proved as it "would be more cruel and de structive to the Indian in the helpless con dition to which the extension of settle ments would soon reduce him than a war of extermination. LANDS IN SEVERALTY. A recommendation is made that por tions of each reservation be divided into suitable tracts ana alluted to each Indian as a sole and separate estate, with a pro vision against selling, mortgaging or leas ing the same. A commission, not exceeding six members, and being three from the army, is advocated to do away with "much expensive mismanagement," the members to "visit each reservation and in vestigate and report to the Seretary of the Interior the condition, peculiar circum stances and needs of the Indians therein." The "squaw men"—those who marry or cohabit with Indian women—are justly shaken up, and he recommends the "pas sage of a law which shall provide that any Indian woman, who shall hereafter marry a citizen of the United States shall be deemed a citizen, and that all children born of such marriage should be deemed citi zens," arguing that no Indian woman would marry such a man with the cer tainty of losing her membership in the tribe aud the right to remain on the reser vation. After referring to the removal of the set tlers from the Crow reservation and Okla homa, the report goes on to say: "The lands reserved for the accommodation of the Indians are undoubtedly much larger in extent than is needed for their wants or accommodation. There can be no harm in recognizing the gradual current slowly tending in the direction of civilized occupa tion and use of the Indian Territory, at i the Indians themselves become consolidated upon fewer residental points; but rapacity and lawlessness will not-abide the gradual and gentle method of change, and seek by violence and forcible invasion to displace law and treaty and the sense of obligation If PUBLIC LANDS. an ac be Re iu was -----------------. by the several States to the United re- g tates am j f or their disposition for the »mm» »««eat »<«»IM« sut. A great deal of space is devoted to the public domain, its origin in 1781, and a history from that time down to the pres ent time, from which the following extract is made: On the 10th of October, 1780, the Con gress of the Confederation, by resolution, provided for the reception of lands to be VIUUIUU OUUV. 1 V W . w —----- —---- . In pursuance of this resolution, as patri of it on of be be is re the a in the the 15 50 04 33 02 pos to go by in & the to as es In a nor im the In ap de the the in the or any be citi cer the set of or at by otic donations for the common good, ces sions were made by several of the States to the United States, by which the western boundary of the Nation was carried from the eastern line of Ohio to the Mississippi, including an era of 259,171,787 acres. Thus on the lstday of March, 1781, the public domain originated. On the 30th day of April, 1803, by the purchase of Louisiana from France the boundaries were carried to the Pacific Ocean and the mouth of the Mississippi. By subsequent purchases, the last of which was Alaska, the whole of the lands acquired reached an area of about 1,814,829,938 arres; 668,526,683.53 acres of thi B has already been sold and conveyed. About 176,000,000 acres more will be required to satisfy land grants to railroads and pri vate land claims. The Alaska purchase, which in the esti mate represents 369.529,600 acres, is largely unexplored, and its actual area and capacities are comparatively unknown. If these be subtracted from the whole area, the residue of land subject to future dis posal would be about 600,772,654.41 acres. Excluding Alaska, about three-fifths the public domain has passed out of the ownership of the Government. The re maining two-fifths embrace a very large proportion of desert and mountain lands, unfitted for habitation. Up to June 30, 1885, 969,469,347.50 acres of land have been surveyrd, leaving 845,360.390.50 acres yet unsurveyed. During the past fiscal year 20,995,513.59 acres of public lands were entered and se lected, yielding a gross revenue of $8,619, 598.32, including $933 598.32 on account of Indian lands. The Secretary recom mends an increase ot the minimum price for lands disposed of at private cash en tries, and he also suggests the repeal of the desert land laws and the timber culture law, TRIBUNE CUTTING. Regarding the promiscuous cutting timber on the public domain the Secretary says: "I would earnestly commend Congress such modifications of the law will providefor the sale of timber on the min eral lands, for the necessary agricultural, mining, domestic and industrial purposes o' the several Territories in the act men tion«a. ~ifcb of the boundaries of land off which such timber is sold, and the re-enactment penalities for trespass on public lands, to all timber cut, except in accordance with the law." Many cases of complaint regarding fees having come to the notice of the depart ment, the Secretary says: "The public good demands that this antagonism tween the pecuniary interest of the officer and his duty should be avoided. To rem edy it I would respectfully suggest, for the consideration of Congress, the passing an act providing an adequate salary full compensation to the officers of the local land offices, payable out of the treas ury of the United States, and the fees to collected on contests as now provided law by the several offices be charged, all which fees should be fully accounted for the officers and paid into the treasury." Congress is asked to appoint two gen eral land agents at a salary of $3,000 per annum to look after the illegal fencing public lands. TIMBER PRESERVATION. Under this head the following very con cise and appropriate legislation is asked 1. —That as to the lands already sur veyed, of which the plats have been filed, appraisers be appointed to examine lands. All legal subdivisions, by sections and quarter sections, more than the half which are overgrown with timber. Trees shall be selected and appraised at their actual value and return made of the lands so selected and appraised to the officers the laud office where the lands so selected shall be marked on the plats "timber land,' with the appraised value thereof. 2. —That in all future surveys, the sur-' veyor shall, as a part of his official duty, so select, appraise and return each survey and mark upon theplatall timber land and the appraised value. 3. —That every fourth section described by number, one-half of which, or more than one-half of which, shall be marked timber land" and appraised, shall (as the quarter sections thereof so numbered) be permanently reserved from sale. 4. —The lands marked upon the plats timber lands and appraised, except the served sections, shall only be sold at public auction to the highest bidderjf or cash (butin no event below the appraised value). The sales to be after full advertisement, and be made on the order of the Secretary the Interior as he may direct. Any lands not sold at. any such auction shall be held subject to future sale in the same manner and subject to the same order and direc tion. 5. —Until the appraisal shall be made and the plats marked all entries made shall required to establish that the land entered is not timber land as described herein. THE UNION PACIFIC. The report of the Railroad Commissioner is given in great detail, but only the follow ing extracts can be given: The Union Pacific Railway Company composed of the Union Pacific, the Kansas Pacific Railway Company and the Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company. One thousand and thirty-four and four thousand eight hundred and forty ten thousandths miles of the Union Pacific and 393.7425 miles of the Kansas Pacific were subsidized. The mileage proper is 1,831.9 miles. careful examination shows the whole property to be in good condition, and commercial industries are energetically proving. The rolling stock comprises 345 engines, 289 passenger cars, 6,960 freight cars. The company's mines yielded a profit $198,592.13. Net proceeds of land sales (to December 31, 1884), $25,668.806.65. Estimated value of landsunsold, $13,602, 696.25. All the engines and cars required manufactured at the company's shops Omaha. The company expended during the year on new construction and equipment: New construction.........................$160,452 New equipment............................. 77,924 The company now owes the Government $48,914,056.62, but none of this is until the maturity of the principal 1895-99.

The road, when finished, would entitle the company to 43,200,000 acres of land. Land sold (to June 30, 1885), 5,468, 779,97 acres. The comnanies assets are $167,136, 755.42; liabilities, $167,044,795.56; being a surplus of $91,959.86. None of the other roads mentioned of any local interest, and their statements would take up more space than is avail able. All matters of importance in the report regarding pensions and patents has ready been published. THT YELLOWSTONE PARK. During the year the the geographical sur vey, which was established six years ago,has with twenty-seven parties in the field, sur veyed 57.508 acres, including 1,000 in Yellowstone Park. The preservation this district of the country and establishment as a National Park Congress iu 1872 was a wise and benifi cient measure in the interests science and for the benefit of the whole peo ple. The natural phenomena contained within its boundaries; the altitude of entire area, over 6,000 feet; the panorama of grand mountain» with summits of petual snow, and sides clothed with prinv eval forests; the great plateaus covered with grass of every variety and studded with crimson and golden and purple in tints of flowers; its great fossil ^forests, whose petrified trunks, when upright, semble the columns of a ruined temple; beautiful Yellowstone Lake, 8,000 above the level of the sea, and covering area of 150 square miles with a sheet water of crystal dearness; . its enty-one geysers, some of which throw streams of water to height of over 250 feet; its 3,000 the the a pres Con be . springs of marvelous forms, coloring variety; the great falls and canyon of Yellowstone river, make up in one view region unequaled by any other on globe, in august splendor, grandeur, novelty and wonder. _ Professor Comstock says of it : "Hot cold springs, mud volcanoes, fnmaroles, solfataras and geysers; rapids, waterfalls and torrents; deep canyons and cragy peaks abound in every direction ; lakes, peaks abound m every direction, iaa gorges and cataracts surprise one at almost every turn, and the whole is situated at point where the grand Rocky Mountain _ A n r. i ,t n L' n it T. fil TiPfl K R system culminates in a knot' of peaks closing the most remarkable lake basin the world." Professor Geikie, Speaking of the Yellow stone river and canyon, says : "For dimen > : A in of sions large enough to be profoundly strik ing, yet not too vast to be taken in by the the eye at once ; for infinite changes of pic turesque detail, and for brilliancy and end less variety of coloring, there are few scenes in the world more impressive than the grand canyons of the Yellowstone." This wonderful section not only furnishes phenomena for the study of the scientific investigator, but its attractions have be come known to all the world, and the Na tional Park is now the favorite resort of our own people of our own country and of foreigners from every civilized country. The act of Congress setting apart this reservation as a national park placed it under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior. GAME IN THE PARK. The new superintendent reports that the game is increasing in the Park. It is now tenanted by 200 bison, elk in large num bers, and several bands of ante lope, the black-tailed and white-tailed deer, mountain sheep, Rocky Mountain goat, beaver, otter, marten, fisher, pheas ant, grouse, prairie chicken, fool-hen, quail, partridge, wild goose, duck, meadow lark, thrush, goldfinch, yellow-hammer, black bird, oriole, jay, snow bird, robin and innu merable BiiiaUpunging birds. Professor Comstock, in an article pub lished in 1874, said : "Unless prompt and vigorous measures are instituted to check the slaughter now in progress in our Western wilds, the.zoological record of to-day must pass into thedomain of the paleontologist." In the preservation of the mammals and birds of the country, the Park will play an important part. The superintendent reports the force of assistant superintendents in the Park tobe insufficient to protect the game and the many objects of interest, and hence acts of vandalism will occur until a force is sup plied large enough to watch over the dif ferent portions of the Park, which is 61 miles long and 53 miles wide. This request for an increase of force seems warranted, and I therefore recommend an appropria tion for five additional assistants. Under Lieutenant Kingman (whose efficiency is most highly commended), the improvements of the roads and bridges in the Park have been as rapidly and efficient ly prosecuted as could be with the appro irv koaJ fiouao af roaila am already admirable drives. This work con tinued until about the last of October, which was as long as the season permitted. I recommend, an increase in the appro priation for the construction of these roads APPROPRIATIONS ASKED. The superintendent's estimate for the next fiscal year amounts to $150,000, in cluding the following items : For pay of superintendent............ $3,500 For pay of 15 assistant superin tendents, at $1,000 each............ 15,000 For pay of one secretary............... 1,500 Incidental expenses........................ 7,500 For headquarters' building and other buildings for Government use............................................... 10,000 For suitable stables and sheds for use of Govern ment stock............. 2,500 For the construction of roads and bridges........................................100,000 For the erection of telephone wires for use of the officers the Park.... 5,000 For extinguishment of claims prior to the dedication of the Park, or as much thereof as may be awarded by a duly constituted commission appointed by the Secretary of the Interior............. 5,000 Total......................................$150,000 "When this estimate was first presented I regarded it as too large. Upon reflection after reading the report of rhe superintend ent, which subsequently came to hand, I do not so consider it." The Secretary gives a synopsis of the re ports of the Governors of all the Terri tories, including Montana, but, as The Miner has already published that, it is here omitted. He also touches on the subject of National University, and advocates its immediate establishment In apologizing for the great length of his report, Mr. Lamar concludes it as follows: "The "subjects considered have extended in this report to a great length, but the numerous, extensive, and very dissimilar classes of the public business committed to the charge of this Department, if considered and presented to Congress with informa tion proportionate to their importance, and adequate to form the basis of intelli gent action, seem incapable of greater com pression, Besides, my own experience in Congress hes impressed upon me the great advantage that would arise from embracing in a single report matters re quiring Legislative action, which would otherwise have to be searched for numerous and disconnected reports, not always easily accessible in the limited time allovved for Le gislation." STABBED WITH A CANDLESTICK. A Miueï Inflicts Three Hounds Free Fight. On Sunday morning about) 3 o'clock Dub lin Gulch was the scene of a very lively and serious fight, in which three or fourmen were engaged, and one of them was stabbed in three places with a miners' candlestick The difficulty is ho badly mixed, that great difficulty was experienced in ascertaining anything about it. The cause of the affair dates some time back, and was the direct result of a fight between a man named Murphy and John Lyons, in which the former was w orsted, Lyons being the better man, and Murphy is said to have since watched for an opportunity to get even and thought that it presented itself last night. Lvons had been around town all night) drinking very freely, and was consid erably intoxicated when he started home about 2:30 o'clock in the morning. Murphy had been watching the proceedings, and it is asserted, had waited for Lyons to get drunk, in the hope of being able to whip him as lie went home. After Lyons had left a saloon on Main street, he was follow*ed by Murphy and another man, and when he had reached a point in Dublin Gulch, out side of the city limits, Murphy came up and in less than a minute a fight was the result Again, as on the former occasion, Lyons was getting THE BEST OF THE SCRAP,, when Daniel Murphy, a brother of the one who was fighting with Lyons, came olong as he was going home from his work in the Parrot mine. " Seeing his brother getting the worst of the affair he very naturally uterfered, and was knocked down. He uniped up, and the fight was continued as a free-for-all. In a few* seconds Lyons fell to the ground and began to scream. He was taken to his home, when it was ascer tained that he had been stabbed three times with a miners' candlestick. When Daniel Murphy left the mine he had his dinner bucket and a miners' candlestick in his hand, and it is supposed that as soon as he got up after being knocked down, and in his excitement, used the candle stick, but upon being locked up in the city prison he claimed that he had given the bucket and stick to another miner who was passing by. THE ARRESTS. Word was at once brought into the city and Marshal Stoner and Officer Frank Mc Donald made their way over the ditches and rocks up into the gulch aud arrested Daniel Murphy on a charge of doing the cutting and brought him into the City Hall and locked him up. Daring the day vesterday Murphy's brother was also arrested, and both of them gave bonds and were rel, ased. When the second Murphy was taken into custody it was ascertain«! that he had been pretty roughly handled in the fight-; and besides being considerably bruised from fist blows, he had received several Kicks in the face, badly battering his countenance. THE WOUNDED MAN. A physician was summoned to attend Lyons immediately after the stabbing and went over to his home. Upon making an examination of the injuries it was found that he had been stuck three times with the candlestick, but the wounds closed up and it was not considered safe to probe them. Probably the most dangerous of the three is the one in the right groin, and it may prove very troublesome. If the instrument went straight- in it is very liable to cause se rious trouble, as it passed very close to the femoral artery, and may have penetrated very deep, but- if it turned downward, as is most probable, there is not likely to be anything serious result from it. A second wound, and almost as perplexing as the other, is near the point of the left shoul der-blade in the back. It is also very diffi cult to tell wliat will come of this thrust, i as, like the former, there was too much j (Jauger in probing, aud it is not known how . deep it may be. The third wound is in the a ' * ----------^ cheek, near the mouth, and does not amount to much. Lyons' friends thinks there is nothing serious in his stabs and that he will be out in a short time. CONFLICTING STORIES. The fight having taken place in the dark, it « as hard for even those close at hand to see just how it was progressing, and it a, verv difficuit to ascertain who was the 8gor> The friends of Murphy cl im a " ne jther he nor his brother startedthe , but tbat l VOU 8 m et Murphy and HI - ' ..... i p i : i 11 i I in in conunenced it himself, and forced it all the way through. The ease will probably be called in the Police court to-day, and further developments may be looked for. A LOVER'S CRIME. A Jealous Man's Awful Act of Revenge. DEADAND WOUNDED A. M. Morrison Killed, Hiram Pony Suicides and Frankie Riley Badly Injured. Special to Thb Minks. Dillon, Montana, December 8.—Shortly after midnight last night Moses Morrison, one of the proprietors of the Nevada ealoon in this town, was about closing the saloon for the night. He invited several parties to take a drink with him. Among the crowd was a gambler by the name Hiram Perry. While the drinks were be ing set up a woman of the town, by the name of Frankie Riley came in and was vited by Morrison to join the party and go to an oyster parlor a few doors away. The woman started in advance of the crowd and the whole party, except Perry, went into the restaurant. Morri son called for oysters for the crowd, and soon after Perry came in and sat at table with Morrison, the woman and others. Morrison went to the clerk's desk and paid for the oysters. About the time Morrison turned from the clerk's desk Perry began to USE SOME ABUSIVE LANGUAGE toward Morrison and the woman. Morri son stepped outside the door, and Perry said:. "God d-n you, I have a notion kill you and her and myself, and end this trouble;" and as he spoke, drew a large army pistol and shot Morrison, entering Dell cnteiiug bdun left eye. Death was instantaneous. Perry then turned and fired at the woman, who was retreating through the back door the restaurant. His aim was good, someone saw the revolver leveled in that direction and SNATCHED THE WOMAN ASIDE. The ball shattered her right arm. Perry then placed the pistol to his own head and blew out his brains. These are about .the facts developed at the inquisition held to-day on the bodies of two men, Perry and his victim. Dr. Pickman amputated the woman's arm, and she is not thought to be in danger dying. She seems to have been the bone contention. The woman, jealousy and whisky played their usual parts, and played them well. .« orrison was liked very much. Perry was a gambler. He parents and friends in Ogden. His remains will be sent to his parents. it he in is THE MURDERED MAN. Universally Liked and Esteemed Everybody Who Knew Him. A. M. Morrison, or "Mose," as he familiarly known, was about 50 years age, and was one of the best known men Montana, having been in the Territory since 1863. Iu that year he came to Ban nack-, in its palmy days, and has been various parts of the Territory ever since. After remaining some time at Bannack drifted away, taking in Virginia City, Madi son county, Jefferson county and other mining districts. About ten years ago moved into Trapper gulch, above Glendale, and there he had a saloon, and afterwards he was engaged in the same business Glendale. At the last election he «as candidate for assessor of Beaverhead county, and was defeated by T. F. Rein hardt. After the result of the contest known, he moved from Glendale to Dillon; where he, in connection with B. H. Dettmer, assumed the proprietorship of the Nevada saloon which they were running at time of his death, also having a branch Bannack, started last summer. Mi. Mor rison was one of those kind-hearted, gener ous and broad viewed men, who have peculiar faculty of making friends wherever they go, and no man in Southern Montana had more warm and true friends than he THE MURDERER AND SUICIDE. Always of a Quarrelsome Disposition Frequently In Trouble. Hiram Perry, the chief mover in the awful tragedy, was raised in Ogden, Utah, was the son of a Mormon Bishop, and about 28 years of age. When a mere he obtained work on the Central Pacific Railroad as a brakeman on a freight train running from Carlin, Nevada, to Toano, but after working there for two or three years he was transferred to the run Ogden west. The mania for gambling the better of him, aud he became a profes sional, since which he has done nothing else. When the Utah and Northern was being built he followed the road as as Dillion. From there he drifted down ttie road, and up as far as Shoshone, Idaho, where he first met Frankie Riley, and they went together into* the Wood River country, finally bringing up in the Cœur d'Alene mines. In Murray, a year ago last May, Perry killed an Indian under the following cumstances: Perry and two other were playing seven-up for $1 a corner. Indian came into the saloon in an intoxi cated condition and wanted to play, those in the game did not desire his presence The Indian was so anxious to take a hand that he was finally let in, ahd the cards were so manipulated that Perry beat Indian out of 50 cents—all the money had. Exasperated at this he drew a knife and ran Perry out of the house. Dodging behind a tree,he told the Indian stop, which he refused to do, and Perry shot him dead in his tracks. Perry acquitted on his preliminary examination. After this he and Frankie Riley came back to Dillon aud that town has since the home of both parties. Perry was powerful young fellow, very quarrelsome when drinking, always ready for a fight any shape. He has been in so many culties in and around Dillon that for some months it has been rumored that the time he made a break he would be treated with a dose of hemp, and several persons there have been afraid he would,kill some good man, as he has done at last. THE CAUSE OF TH SHOOTING. A Sketch of the Woman Who Caused Desperate Deed, it Frankie Riley, the woman over whom the murder and suicide took place, about 30 years of age, and was not by means a handsome woman, although kind-hearted, generous woman,' and who is alway to be found on hand when act of charity was needed. She was mar ried to James Riley, also a gambler, Frisco, Utah, about ten or twelve years ago. Riley left her iu that place, but after some months returned and took her him to Ogden, and thence to Shoshone, where they had a split up, and the woman became the mistress of Perry, following him in his rounds. While in Dillon lived only a short distance from the vada saloon, and frequently went there liquors. Perry was always jealous of although he knew perfectly well what character was, and treated in a most shameful manner, often beating and abus ing her. Mr. Morrison sympathized the woman, and when Perry and Riley were dealing faro in the Nevada saloon, often remonstrated with Perry for his treatment of the woman. Perry's jealousy undoubtedly increased as time wore on, in a drunken spell he spilled the blood of good man and ended his ow.i miserable istence. ChurcbiU'H New Idea.
