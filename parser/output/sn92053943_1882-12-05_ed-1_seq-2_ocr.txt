I invite the attention' of 1c6tfgresst to the propriety of making more adequate provisions for arming and equipping the mOitia than is afforded by the act ot 1806, which is still upon the-statUTe" books.

The two acts, wheil construed together, seem to forbid re!Iving, even for absolute incapacity, the ofijeers who do not fall within the purview of Ifhe latter statute save at such times as there is chances to be less than four ha6&?d names on the retired list. Ttere ar sow four hundred and twenty. ' It to not likely that congress intended thi rftsult, wi'lr- concur with the secretary that the law .ought to le amended. RIVERS AND ' HARBORS. The grounds that impelled me to wjth hold my sitature frofcn the bill entitled An act-ffskinff apDTOpria,ion for the constrdCtlom repair.tandfpr JServatlon; of certain worse on risers ana harbors," which became a law near the close of our last session prompt me to express that no similar measure be deemed necessary dur ing tne present session of congress. 1 n- deed such a measure would now be open to serious objection in addition to that which was lately urged upon your atten tion. I am informed by the secretary of war that the greater portion of the sum an pronriated for the various items specified In Hi-it .remains unexpended of the new ofts ; which it authorized; expenses have been incurred upoxt two only forwhfch the total afpropriation ws $210,000. The present available balance is disclosed by 4he folhywing 'toblej .Amount of appro- imaiion Dy act or Aug. 2, 1883. $738,875 00: amount of appropriation by - act of June 19, 1882, $10,000; amount of appro priation for payments to J. is. reacts, $304, 000; unexpended balance of former appro E nations $4,738,263; total $23,791,138. ess amount drawn from treasury between July 1st, 1862 ana 2Sv. 80, 1882, $6,056, 194; total $17,734,944. It is apparent by this exhibit that as concerns most items to which the net of August 2, 1882, relates there can be no need of further appropria tions until after the close of u present sosRiOB. -if. no-ever. "anvctt6n- should be necessary in respect to particular ob jects it will be entirely feasible to provide tor those objects by appropriate legisla tion. It ia possible, for xaffipl, that i delay until the assembling" of the next con gress to make additional provision for the Mississippi river improvements might be attended with serious consequences. If such should appeared be the case a just dui reiatiHg to the snmecr would command my approval. This leads me to offer a suggestion which I trust will commend it self to the wisdom of congress. Is it not advisable: that grants 4f-considerable sums of money "for "diverse and ' independent scnemes or internal improvement should be made the subject of separate and dis tinct legislative enactments? It will scarcely be &ainsayed even by those who fasrorintoe'taoBt liberal expenditures for purposes sought e be ceom- Iplishcif iv Whafc" is --wommanlv trailed -the?-- ftvef- td'baflwjrv bill,'' that' toe practices of grouping in such a bill appre ciations for a gTeat diversity of objects widely separated tuber tn their nature, In the locality with which they are concerned. or in both, is one which is to be most dep recated." Unless it is remediable it is inev itably tending to secure the success of the bill as a whole, though man v of the items. if separaratelv considered, could scarcelv fail of rejection. By the adoption of the course I recommended every member of congress, whenever opportunity should arise for giving bis influence and vote for nrerttorioosappre-priations, which be would be enabled to do without being called upot to sanction others deserving his approval. So, al6o, would the executive be afforded a full opportnnlty to exercise his constitu tRmal preTTg&tfvF4pf appropriatien ' seems t hint; objection ablerwitbont inspcriling Che success of oth ers which' commended themselves to bis judgment. It may be urged, in opposition to these suggestions, that a number of works of international improvement, which are justly entitled to governmental aid, is so .great as to render impracticable "several apprftpriation bills therefor, or even for such a comparatively limited number las to make a disposition of large sums of money, 1 ins objection may be well founded, or' whether it be or not, the ad vantages which would be likely to ensue from the adoption of ILe course I have recommended, may perhaps be more effec tually attained by another, which I respect fully submit to congress as an alternative proposition. Itwasr provided bv the-tson- stitutioas fefffotmeen at our states that the executive may disapprove any item oi' items of a bill appropriating money, where upon the part of the bill apprpved shall be law, and the part disapproved shall fail to "RfectiBhe law unless Repassed according td pro-vlsions prescrlbejd for the" paasasre of billi over thrf veto ''of ihs? cMicotive. "ibe states wherein some such provision as the foregoing is a part of the fundamental law, are: Aiabania,"Califoruia. Colorado, Flor ida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mis souri, Nebraska, Now. Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia. I commend to 7011 careful consideration the question whether the amendment of the federal constitution in the particular indi-cated-woOld not afford the best remedy for wbat is often a grave embarrassment, both to the execu- tive. . and is sometimes a serious public mischief. THE 

TTATT." It appears by the secretary's report that the available naval force of the United states consists of 37 cruisers, 14 single tur- a n number of smooth-bore guns and rifled "efcnnon. The cruising vessels should be gradtliHy replaced by irotnor steel ships,, the mouitdts. by modern - armored -vessels; and the arfeament by higft S power rifled bans. The teiconstruction "of our navv. 4iich was recfttnmended in my 'last mes sage, was begun dv congress authorizing in its recent act the construction of two large steel vessels of the character recom mended by the lafte naval advisory board, "I'StfOTftjeet to approval of a new advisory. uaara to im mf, aed as provided by that act. ';' tiM atit-ation to the fecommemda tion "'of tbe f tecitary of the board, that aath6i4ty;b5gfe,-ja to construct two more ccubJCTf 'f -smaller dimensions, and one fleet-dispatch vessel, and that , ap propria-. tions be maae ior nign power tiannon, lor torpedo service, and for other harbor de fenses. Pending considefation' "by con gress of the policy to be hereafter adopted in conducting the eight large large , jiavy yards and their expensive establishments, the secretary advocated a reduction of ex penditures therefor to the lowest possible amounts. For the purpose of affording the officers and seamen of the navy Oppor tunity for excercise and discipline in their 1 profession, under appropriate control aud ejection, toe secretary advises that the 1 jthouse and coast survey be transferred, w organised, from tl treasury t navy department; and he also suggests, for. the reasons which he assigns, that similar transfer may wisely be made of the cruising revenue vessels. The secretary forciblv depicts the mtimate-connection and independence of ihe "tsavyandlbe commercial marine, aad iuvites attention to - the continual decadence tf th latter, unJ he V ofresnoudina tratisfer of our growing commerce to foreign bottoms This subject is one of the utmost import ance to our welfare. The methods of re viving American ship-building and of rein stating the United Spates flag in the ocean carrying trade should receive the imme diate attention of congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant material for the construction of modern iron steam ships in fair competition with our com mercial rivals. Our disadvantage in building ships is the greater cost of labor, and in sailing them higner taxes ana great er interest on capital, while the ocean highways are already monopolized by our formidable comioutors. inese oosiacies should in some wav be overcome, and for rapid communication with foreign lands we should not continue to depend wholly upon vessels built in other countries and sailing under foreign flags. With no United States steamers on the principal lines to foreign ports our facilities for ex tending our commerce are greatly restrict ed. while the countries that build and sail the ships and carry the mail and passen gers. obtain thereby conspicuous ad van tages in increasing their trade. POSTAIi MATTERS. The report of the Postmaster General gives evidence of the satisfactory condition of the department, and contains many val uable data and accompanying suggestions which cannot fail to be of interest. The information which it affords that the receipts for the fiscal year have ex ceeded the expenditures must be gratifying to congress and to the people of the coun try as matters which may fairly claim par ticular attention. I refer you to his ob servations in reference to the advisability of changing the present basis for fixing salary and allowances, of extending the functions f. postal establishment sd s to have under Its carrtrol, the tele jraph sys tem of the cfruntrv, mougb from this lffst and important recommendation I must withhold my concurrence. At the last session of congress several bills were intro ! duced into the House of Representat ives for. the reduction of letter postage to the rate of 2 cents per half ounce, Ibava given much study and reflection to' this! subject and am thoroughly persuaded that such reduction would be for the best inter ests of the public. It has been the policy of the government from the foundation, to defray as far as "possible the expenses of carrving the mails by a direct tax in tne form of postage, and it has never been claimed, however, that this service ought to be productive of a net revenue. As has been stated already, the report of the postmaster general shows that there is now a very considt-rabie surplus . in tus department, and that henceforth the re ceipts are likelv to increase at a much greater rah than tne f necessary- expend! tures. Uniteat j56nCfihajz4 iahotadAiialbe existing laws, the profits of the postal ser vice will in a very few years swell the revenues uf the government many millions of dollars J The J irofc 'seems fcouspaCuous, therefore, for some reduction in the rates of postage. In what shall that reditction consist? A revision of the legislation which has been had upon the subject dur ing the last thirty years discloses that do mestic letters constituted the only class of mail matter which has never been favored by a substantial reduction of rates. I am convinced that the burden of maintaining the service falls most unequally upon that class, and that more than any other is en titled to present relief. That such relief may be extended without detriment to other public interests will be discovered. Upon reviewing the results of former re ductions. immediately prior to the act of 1845 the postage upon a letter composed of a single sheet was as follows r If cenveyed 30 miles or less, six cents; between 30 and 80 miles, ten cents; be tween 80 and 150 miles, 13 r cents; be tween 150 and 400 miles, 18$ cents; over 400 miles, 25 cents. By the act of 1845 the postage upon a single letter, conveyed for any distance under 300 miles, was fixed at five cents, and for a greater distance, ten cents, fifty per cent reduction m tax for carriage would at once increase the num ber of letters consigned to the mails. The advantages of the secresv would leed to a 1 very general substitution of sealed packets for postal cards and open circulars and in divers other ways the volume of first class i matter would be enormously augmented. Such an increase amounted in England in the first year after adoption of penny pos tage was more than 125 per cent. As a result of careful estimates the dteails of which cannot be here set out, I am con vinced that the deficiency for the first year would be small. ..... If congress should approve these sug -gestions it may be deemed desirable to supply to some " extents the deficiency which must for, time result by increasUng the charge for carrying merchandise, which is nowmly 16 eeits per pound; but even without .such. tf increase I-ani coafiehHit that the receipts under the diminished rates would equal the . expenditures after the lapse of three "br four years.
