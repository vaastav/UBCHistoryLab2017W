If, lo addition to drying up the manifesto business, the Administration can in duce its commsnding Generals to foiget every thing bat tbe rebellion and know no purpose bat its overthrow, we [think all good loyal people will have no difficulty in standing up squarely, shoulder to shoulder, in its sopport as heretofore. pg* The editor of tbe N.

BENTON BARRACKS, Dec, 6th, 1861. DEAR HAWK-EYI:—Tbe tattoo has been beat Tapps have been beaten, and I ought to be in my blanket but thoughts of home and a desire to let brother Hawk-Eyes hear from us, prompt nie to violate law in allowing my light to burn so late. The Fourteenth Regiment, you are aware, is a divided 'one, three companies {having gone early last antumn to Fort Randall. Tbe other seven rendezvoused at Davenport, and it wasaaid were destined for Fort Leavenworth. A month anil a half ago the regiment was filled and the boys were anxious to be "off." Weeks passed by aud yet there was no indication of our going. A little before midnight of the 26tb, tbe loud hurrahs of the boys announced to tbe citizens of Davenport that the time of our departure was at hand. The next day we left Camp Mc Glellau. The younger ones were enthusiastic for notwithstanding the assertions of the elder and more experienced, that this was a good and very likely the best place they would socn see they had become dissatisfied. From some cause only three companies went down the river that day. The others were ordered back to camp to go on tbe following day, by Railroad, to Alton, thcnco by steamboat to St. Louis. We arrived at the latter place on the 80th somewhat ex hausted from tho want of sleep and proper food. From these causes, change of climate, &c., the regiment has been quite unhealthy. For sever cral days there were from three to eight in cacb company confined to their bunks, and almoat one-third of tbe regiment were complaining,but ns time progresses we are becoming acclimated and coming out "all right." Nearly all are well and all are better. Benton Barracks are between three and four miles from tbe river, and in a westerly direction from the city. Without entering into a descrip tion of tbe place, let me say tbat the "conven iences of life" are here. It is regularly laid off and resembles a city more than a soldier's en campment Scattered over the place at regular distances, are not wells, but fountains of water, conducted hero by pipes from the waterworks of the city. There is a large washing establish ment here, worked by an engine and fifty women, and all who will can have their washing done at Uncle S\m's expense. Here, too, is a horse car railroad to carry provender for the horses and food for the men. Aside from these are some not so necessary perhaps, indeed, the soldier or the dear ones at home, would be better without them entirely, for tbey supply him with things he can well do without, and in lieu take the money, which his family actually needs. Such are the eating-saloons, groceries, Sutler's estab lishments, Ac., &c. There are between fifteen »nd twenty thous and men here, but they are being sent to other places, so that their number will soon be greatly diminished. Other correspondents of yours talk about the boys being keen for fight not so with as, how ever, for like a few others, we have nothing to fight with, nor are there any arma here for us. save some old Belgian muskets, unfit for service. The boys are full of fun no such thing here as the blue*, but a'contiuued succession of witti cisms and tricks. Well may tbey be contented for they are well fed, well clothed, well paid, and in the service of an uncle who never was whip ped, though attacked by a big (John) Bull when quite aboy. _u Yesterday our company (Co. K, Capt Camp, bell of Kossuth,) expressed a wish to go outaida the lines, ostensibly to drill, but in reality to breathe the free air, have a romp over tho hiila, and ntay be "skirmish" a little—not on the en» my, but oa aomething edible. This waa readily granted by our Captain, aad away they scamp ered, reminding one forcibly of schoolboys on holiday. Recall from drill and dinner call panted, yet tbe boys came not, bat jMt aa wo were getting alarmed for their safety tbey came in, not empty but with haversacks filled with persimmons snd a few applet. 11 mi pardon for oeoopyings much spaoe in your columns.

Daring his stay here, I became very, well acquainted with the gentleman. His aame is John F. Udey. Ho is a British sutyect, aad it waa through his pnv ikges as such tbat bo made hia way through both liaea of belligereata, thoagh ha was de taiaed some time at Richmond, aad at laat got away from than with much difficulty. He is la partnership with '*Gov."Giiaaer ia a gold mine, aad came at the reqaset of Mr. Giiawr, who was employed aa aa attorney to attend to the matter aad to try to save tho property for the children, Tho property io large in amount, comprising the often-spoken-of property in Mississippi aa well as tbe large estate la North Carolina. Tbe flrat Mrs. Douglaa, the mother of tho two aurviv iag children of Mr. Douglas, was an only child. Her father was one of the wealthiest men ia North Carolina. All bis property in that State, together with the Mississippi plantation, waa be queathed to his daughter and her children—Mr. Douglaa being excluded, as tbe old gentleman considered him too anaafe adepoaitory for a large property. This property ia now all liable to confiscation, and likely very coon to be con fiscate d. Besides that, squatters are encroach iag upon it, and its value ie depreciating. Mr. Udey informs me that tbe Carolina property alone ia estimated at $700,000 to $800,000. Of the amouut, there ia about $100,000 in hard caah tbat can be bad by coming after. There is a fine home estats, with an elegant mansion,* full of servants and ready fo.' tbe occupancy o tbe family. Mra. Douglas waa invited through Mr. Udey to come down with the children, oc cupy tbe mansion and save tbe property. Tbe children (boys) were pretty much raised there, and (especially the oldest) seemed not averse to going. Reverdy Johnaon, the attorney for the children advised that they shonld go, as it was only a temporary matter, and involved neither the legality nor their permanent residence. But Mra. Douglas, beiag their guardian, refused not only to go with them, but, after many interviews and consultations, resolutely, and at every in terview, refused lo let tbe children go. Her chief argument was that she did not believe that Mr. Douglas, if he were alive, would allow his children to take op their residence in a dis loyal State for the purpose of preserving their property, or for any other object No effort could surmount this objection, and Mr. Udey has retained.' The property will doubtless soon be confiscated, and, for tbe presen^at least, en tirely lost It is a great sacrifice, especially as it is underatood that it leaves the children, who would otberwiae be very wealthy, 'substantially penniless. There is somo property here of com paratively s:nall value,—worth perhaps $16,000 but a mortgage will by and by devour that. The rent derived from it is the present source of livelihood for the family. The Chicago property is understood also to be mortgaged so heavily that it will never be available for the family. The recovery of North Carolina to the Union ia the only present pocuniary hope of the children of Stephen A. Douglas. 

IOWA. FROn WASHINGTON. [Cornqxradeaee of the Hawk-l e.] WASHINGTON, Die. 9, 1861. Log cabins and rough board bouses are going up for* the winter quarters of a part of our im' mense army. The dense forests along the Poto mac afford ample material, and the labor and rude akill of the soldiers do the rest And as the style of achievements is dependent on the taste of each soldier, their villages present a decidedly unique appearance. Still, nobody be lieves the army is to go into quarters before some great movement Iu Washington, the presence of the immense throng which tbe Army and Congress bring with them, has given a great rctivity to every branch of business. Every petty boarding-house mis tress holds her seven-by-nine rooms at triple the prices asked six months ago. Every little atore room is crowded with knick-knacks for aoldirta, mostly under the auspices of Jews, and flaming sign-boards announce to the world that Sutler's Suppliet" can be had cheaper than at any other locality. The amount of business done by these suppliers of sutlers is immense, and large fortunes will doubtless be made by it But I would not advise any new-comers to em bark in it, because Congress has become con vinced that the department of sutlers, under the existing regulations, is a most atrocious swindle, and will doubtleaa place it hereafter under the most stringent restrictions, if not abolish it altogether. The President's Message is commented upon as a plain, straight-forward document, with not much literary elegance, and a considerable amount of motaphysical abstraction which might have been omitted without injury. Nobody cares now for essays on capital and labor. Tbe accompanying reports are all able. The Secretary of the Navy gives such a plain state" ment ot the energy which has dealt such blows to the rebellion, and such a firm aud unreserved commendation of Captain Wilkes as justly make him very popular. The Secretary of War, apart from statistics and bis reserved views as to slavery, starts a novel idea, the division of the cumbrous State of Virginia, into aeveral portions,—all west of tbe Blue Bidge, to be the State of Virginia, all eaat ot the Blue Ridge to be annexed to Mary land, and all of Maryland and Virginia, east of Chesapeake Bay, to be incorporated into Dela ware. Virginia, it is claimed, is sn anomalous State without any great natural boundaries. This division would givo these boundaries, aud would make Maryland and Virginia two States of de. sirable size, and would constitute Delaware, now hardly more than a geographical name, a State of very respectable dimension". But its chief merit is that it would place tbe Capital of the nation in the interior of Maryland, thereby ac cording to Mr. Cameron, rendering it much safer from tbe dangers of civil discord. Tbe report of the Secretary of the Treasury is not yet submitted. It is looked for with grea1 ioterest, as it is understood that Mr. Chase will recommend radical ckangea. One of these will be the doing away of the shinplasters ot irre sponsible bauks and the substitution instead, of national notes, secured by the best property of the nation. A society has been formed to securo a course of lectures. from radical men in this city this winter,—a new wonder in Washington. I learn tbat Wendell Pbillipa, Gerritt Smith, Beecber, Chapin, Greeley, Bayard Taylor, G. W. Curtis, Whiuier, D. S. Dickinson, and a heat ot others, have been invited and that many of them have accepted tbe invitation. f, .XOX,

VUOIBIA nnaniiim. For tbia struggle, ao -suddenly oomsseaoed, Virginia tad for aome time been makino such preparations aa ber mesas enabled her to asake and although she waa not so well prepared aa waa desirable, atill ahe waa better prepared than uoat of ber Southern elaters—better, perhaps, than any one of them. For aome tiam anterior to the Secession, she bad been engaged in the purchase of arma of different Hade, ammunition and other neoeeeary articles, and in amounting artillery, in anticipation of the event which subsequently occurred. GOVERNOR VLOTD A» TEH SIX fOOXBtSS. On the 28th day of February, 1846, the Legis lature directed the Superintendent of the Ar mory to sell, andcr the direction of the Execu tive,* uil such arma and accoutrements then ia the Armory as were not worth repairing. Thla order waa construed by Governor Floyd to in clude the iron six pounders then at tbe Armory, and bv an order dated February 22, 1849, tbe Superintendent waa directed to ssll them at not less than twenty-five dollars each. Fortunately for uS there were no bidders at that price, and the guna remained in possession of the State, and now each one of thoae pieces is in tbe field, and they have proved to be equal to any guna of like calibre now in service. How small a circumstance controls the greatest events.— What embarrassments would have attended our operations in this important struggle, if these pieces bsd not been in our possession and ready for transportation to the field. WHT rORTRBSS MOIROB WAS BOT CAPTtTRKD. It is to be regretted that Fortress Monroe is not in our possession—that it was not aa easily csptured as tbe navy yard and Harper's Ferry, As far back as the 8th of January last, I con sulted with a gentleman whose position enabled him to know the strength of that fortress, and whose experience in military matters enabled bim to form a:i opinion as to the numbor of men thst would be required to capture it He repre sented it to be on* of the strongest fortification* in the world, and expressed his doubts whether it could be taken, unless assailed by water as well as by land, and simultaneously. He stated, emphatically and distinctly, that with the force then in tbe fortress it would be useless to at tempt its capture without a large force, thor oughly equipped and well appointed. At no time previous to the secession of Virginia had wc a military organization sufficient to justify an attempt to take it and events since that occur rence demonstrate very clearly tbat with our military organization since, and now existing, it has not been deemed prudent to make tbe at tempt GOVIKSMENT MUSKETS BOUGHT TO ARM YIROIHIA Prior to the Secession of the State, indeed from the commencement of my Gubernatorial term, I used all proper means within my reach aided and supported by the military commission, to prepare the State for defence. In answer to this recommendition, the Gener al Assembly appropriated one hundred and eighty thousand dollars in bonds, to be expend ed in tbe purchase of arms, equipments and mu nitions of war. If we could then have pur chased all the arms which we desired to obtain, our State would have been in a better condi tion to repel the assaults of the Federal execu tive. At the tiir.e we made the purchase of fire thousand muskets from the Federal Government we desired to purchase ten thousand additional, but tho authorities declined to sell them to us although five times tbe number were then in the Arsenal at Washington. VIRGINIA VOLOTITBKBS IK THS FIELD. It is impossible at this time to state the pre cise number of voluuteers and militia that Vir ginia now has in tke field, owing to tbe fact that the mustering at Norfolk, Lynchburg, Abingdon, 8taunton, Winchester, Harper's Ferry, the Po tomac division, and other places, have cot made their returns to the Inspector-General's office in thiscity. From the light before me, I estimate the number at not less than seventy thousand. We have in service fifty-nine regiments of in fantry, and a considerable number of battalions and companies in this arm of the service that have not been organized into regiments. We have eight organized regiments of cavalry, and a number of companies attached to different commands, which, if consolidated, would make probably three regiments more. We have is sued three hundred and fifteen pieces of artil lery, nearly all of which are in service in the field. One artillery regiment only has been or ganized, and that was organized at the instance of General McGruder. EXPENDITURES Or TBS STATE. The expenditures of the State for war purpo eea since the 17th of April last amount to more than six millions of dollars. Her contributions of men and money for the common cause have been cheerfully furnished, nnd her past course gives assurance of her determination to spare no effort to insure success. She feels and knows, and therefore acts upon the principle, that noth ing short of the fuH and free recognition of the independence of the Southern Confederacy can give assurance of protection to persons air pro perty, and happiness and prosperity to her peo ple. Every consideration, therefore, that should influence a people prompts us to repudiate all compromises, to reject all advances toward re construction. We must triumph in this strug gle. In that alone consists our safety for the present and the future. 

WHAT VIROW1A HAS DOSE ROB OTHER STATES. In addition to arming our own troops,we have issued arms to such unarmed regiments, battal ions and companies as came from other States to participate in this struggle. I have furnish ed to our friends in Maryland three thousand muskets: to Tennessee five batteries of six-poun der field pieces, comprising four guns each, and have armed a number of fine infantry regiments to Missouri, two aix-pounder rifled cannon and five hundred muskets to Kentucky, thirty-six hundred muskets, and have furnished arms to regiments, battalions and companies from Tej as, Louisiana, Georgia and South Carolina. Ve ry reoently I have furnished one thousand mus kets to South Carolina, and aome heavy guns and five hundred muskets to North Carolina. HOBTH-WESTERN VIROIRIA. I refer with mortification and regret to the unpatriotic spirit which has been exhibited by a portion of our people in North-western Virginia, and to tbe dis'oyal and revolutionary acta to which tbey have resorted to dismember this Commonwealth, and to organise a new State within its limita.

To ssy nothing of tbe arrogance of Congress la assuming to sit ia jadgtnent upon military matters and to arraign and try tho officers of the army, what shall wo say of tbe madness tbat proposes to jadge snd dsnounoe the offioers upon whom the defense of tbe oountry rests, aad without whose services there would be slight prospect of maintaining tbe Union. It is tare that mistakes hare been made and it ia true that many of oar officers were inexperienced aad have made that fact ev ident it u true also thst some of our most cx perieoced officers have blundered badly, and that the national cause has loat sadly thereby. Bat tbe best military officers are have or are likely to kave are inexperienced, compared with tbe veteran generals of Karope, and there is no ab solute perfection in military science mere than in any other branch of human eflbrt, and the ablest snd bravest generals the world has ssen, have committed errors and lost battles. We be gan the war with raw troops and inexperienced commanders. It is one of the inevitable neces si tiea of the case tbat oar armies and command ers be educated in the service, and errors were to be expected. Bat is it worth while to de Sve ide snd drive from the service the best men we because they are imperfect V Aad yet that would be tbe inevitable effect of tho course that Congreee ia aaked to pursue, and no course that could be taken would so rapidly demoralize and destroy our armiea aa this. If members of Congress have charges to make sgaiuat any of our generals, let them lay their complainta before the Cou.maader-in-Chief, and if there ia apparent grounds for it they will doubtless be court-martialed and puniahed or ac quitted by tbeir peers in the service, who stone are competent to judge of the facts and princi ples involved and to reach an intelligent and juat decision. A congressional inquest on tbe Bull Run and Ball's Bluff disssters, and a half dozen others that have been mentioned in Congress, would be just as appropriate as an inquest of editors on the subject, and that has already been held, fortunately with such a variety of decisions tbat none of our generate have been seriously damaged in the war of worda. If Mr. Sumner tbinka Gen. Halleck'a course in Missonri is bad policy and inhuman and shameful, let him say so to the President, to tbe Secretary of War, to Gen. McClellan, and give bis reasons. But it is something worse than bad taste to denounce him before Congress and tbe country, and then if tbe Senate is so far misled as to undertake to arraign or censure Gen. Hallock or any other command er, it will find tbat a serious blunder hss been committed and that mischief has been done tbat cannot be easily repahed. There ia no more di fficult military position than that now occupied by Gen. Halleck, and he is certainly manifesting comprehensiveness and energy in his plans, and vigor and earnestness in his declarations. He deserves at leaat ordinary forbearance and can dor. So do all our generals. They have a work of tbe greatest difficulty in band, such as must task the highest powers. No war against a for eign nation can be compared with this in tbe skill and energy required for its successful pro secution. It is a work of exposure and self-sac rifice, too, such as those who sit comfortably at home, or make severe and pretty speeches in ly ceums and the halls of Congreas, have little cou ipntion of. Shall those upon whom we chiefly rely for the salvatioirof tbe country in this hour of its peril be disarmed at the outset Shall we destroy and throw aside the commanders we have because tbey are not perfect in the judg ment of civilians and according to the standards of those who know war only as it is seen in rbe toric and poetry No, no.

LOUISVILLE, Nov. 30. Did you ever put a large lump of lead in ladle, and place the ladle over a hot fire If you were not sure the lead must ultimately yield to the beat, when the ladle became red hot and tbe atubborn lump looked as far from fusion as when you held it in your band, you might have despaired. But you waited, like a manifest des tinist, a few seconds longer, end then a little bright stream of liquid metal begin to steal from under the cool looking gray mass. Yon pressed the top gently with tbe poker, and all tumbled into glistening molten metal, except the dross. That lump of lead, which would not melt—its out-given stubbornness said it wouldn1 —was a fit emblem of the greit rebellion, as now lies in tbe hot ladle of loral wrath. The infusable-lookiug political hypocrites and thieves at Richmond, the eddy-driven, time-serving poli ticians who are striving to fatten themselves on the apoila of a groaning, oppressed people, and the subsidized and brutalized writers who live dissipated life by lying for tbe usurping conspire tors, are tbe coating of dross which proclaims, "You cannot melt tbe lump." But a blight stream haa stolen from uuder them at Hatteras, another at Port Royal, and another through the mountains of East Tennessee. The dressy sur face begins to move. They are anxious to alide off before tbe maas becomes a lake of fused metal, and they find themselves floating lightly on the top to be brushed off and thrown into the aahae of infamy. All accounts show that the people are sick of secession throughout the South. But none dare speak their minds, lest their liberty of locomo tion shoal be taken away, or tbeir property con fiscated after they have been driven into exile. In the boaated cotton States, when wealthy planters—planters who were wealthy—ire ap proached by impudent vagrants endeavoring to raise, clothe and equip military companies', tbey dare not refuse a subscription or donation. But to such penury have tbey b«en reduced by tax ation and the high prices of all things necessa ry for the subsistence of their families and their alaves, that in many instances tbey are forced to give their notes for ten or twenty doliara.

IBISH BRIGADE IM MISSOVRI—An anec. dote of the war in Missouri was thus told by Colonel Mulligan in a recent add re as at Detroit^: With your permission I will now relate a circumstance which occurred in Missouri. "Oa pleasant spot just outside Jefferson City lay eticamped two regiments, over which floated twin banners—banners which will be twin forever—the Harp of Ireland and the Stars and Stripes of America. [Applause.] Under this twin banner lay aa gay and rollicking a regiment as you ever met, vis, the Irish Brigade. Instructions came requiring the Commander to report at head-quarters for orders. These in structions came (to use a military term) after tap,' which ia a time when civil men should be in bed. [Laughter.] The question was asked, When pan you march Immediately,' waa the answer. Well, I wish you to go to Tipton's relief, cut your way through the enemy, go to Lexington, take it and hold it' [Cheers.] The next day saw tbe Irish Brigade on its way to Lexiogton. [Cheers.] As we moved along w smoothed his wrinkled brow, tbe Chaplain mixed his admonitions with occaaionally chanting a snatch of an Irish melody. The Major was a married man, and chanted, Ever of tbee I am fondly dreaming.' The Lieutenant-Colonel was a married man, and, not to be personal, I was a married man, and followed the Major. [Laugh ter and applause. Thus we went on, until ar riving within two miles of Lexington, where we encamped,-aud previous to entering the city we washed and brushed up so aa to make a respect able appearance. [Laughter.] We went in with our solitary six-pounder, muzzled in roses and breeched in evergreens, and, notwithstand ing our wesry nine days, march, we looked well. (Cbeers.] We started with three days' rations, and six days we had to live on the country.— We were told to cut our way through, but we left the -impress of our teeth far deeper than that of the sword in the section through which are passed. [Laughter and applause."] HOLD FINANCIAL Movie or THC FBENCH EIR rzROK.—Louis Napoleon bas performed one of the boldest acts of hia eventful life. He haa decided to leave finances to his advisers. He must either be in a very tight place or must feel very strong. Acbille Fould, wbo was Min ister of State from 1852 to '60, resigned, and Forcade took tbe finances. But they don't go right, and the Emperor wants Fould back sgain. Fould writes a letter of four columns, and shows the Emperor that his power of putting his band into the treasury at pleasure, under tbe name of "supplementary credits," upsets all finances. He shows tbat for the first six years, Napoleon took in that way an average of $26,000,000 above estimates and taxes, and for the last two years increased it to 140,000,000 that there is new a deficit or floating debt of $200,000,000, which must be funded and that if he goes on in this way his government must come to grief tbat he bas still to provide for the famine, and ro forth. Fould, therefore, advises tbe Emperor to renounce the power of drawing money from the Treasury without a bill voted by tbe Legie lature and tells bim that if he will do thia his finances can be restored. Also that such re nouncement will allay tbe fears of Europe, which is constantly arming, because they fear his mon etary power, and will be relieved only by his surrendering it. Tbe Emperor therefore re nounces the purse, concedes it to the Legisla ture, appoints Fould minister of finance, and has the courage to publish Fould'a expose in the Moniteur. A foreign letter writer thinks there can be no certainty as to France's policy and now tbat the Emperor is so bard pressed at home, if his economical scheme fails to re-assure the country, or if tbe old influences manage once more to drive out Mr. Fould, then all foreign nations had better at once put on their warpaint and sharpen their tomahawks, for there will be acalping to do soon. Fallare or tbe Merrtnaae. Fortress Monroe, Nov. 26. The Confederate iron-clad frigate Merrimac is now universally OQOceded by the authorities here to be a complete failure, ao much so that all work upon her his-been for aome time abandon ed. It appears that the original intention of the rebel engineers was to cover the entire vessel to within a short distance below the water line with two layers of rolled iron 2} inches in thick ness. A large portion of this iron had been rolled at the Tredagar Iron Works, Richmond, and tbe holes for riveting were, to expedite matters, punched at the worke before being brought to Norfolk. Well, the first difficulty these engineers encountered was, that when these plates were "bent" or "turned" to be ap plied to tbe sides of the vessel, none of. ihtte Jtolei matched, so they were compelled to resort to the expedient Jof filing and "reaming" them out before tbe rivets could be inserted. The next waa that tbe ship, which is at the dry docks at tbe old Navy Yaid, commenced to settle on the •'docks," owing to tbe enormoas weight of tbe iron placed upon ber. These, and p.ooa bly other reasons which wo have not heard of, are thought here to have eauaed the abandon ment of the work. So much for Southern me chanics.—Cor. of New York Timea.

We cited the grtifytog fact, as among the eoaweasstioas of this abnormal period la oar civil history,tbat tbe people of the loyal States have with sarpri siog anaaimity upheld the hands of the PreeL dent in this day of giddinees and revolt, while tho President bas shown by bis prudence, aot aamlagled with firmness, that, so far aa depead. sd oa bim, this happy aaanimlty should receive BO shock. Aad if sach wss a just interpretatioa of the acts by which the Executive baa indicated his adherence to tbe original theory on which this war was undertaken, he bas subssqueatly Bads it apparent to all by tbe emphatic declaration of hia message, that he contemplates no depar ture from the path in which, "obeying the dic tates of prudence, as well ss tho obligations of law," bo baa determined to guide bis -*tm Confessing biaiself "anxious sod careful" that tbe inevitable conflict joined for the suppres sion of Insurrection msy not degenerate into "a violent aad remorseless revolutionary straggla* be significantly adds, la tho saaw breath, thitit Is for thlnsason be haa, "in every caae, thought it propefto keep the Integrity of tbe tJska prominent as tbe primary object of tbe rrmtra on oar part, leafing all pmtieni which annate/ vital military inyxrrtance to Humor* ddiberait *e (ion of the Legulahcre." If ire may credit tbe report of tbe iHrtfo journals, it baa been well and wiiely said by distinguished supporter of the Administrates who is ss much romarkaMo'fcr the souadasmsf bis political ideas as for hia forcible mode of stating them—we allude to Mr. Senator ftpfo mer—that "war is not a business Congress em engineer. It is properly Executive bumimt, ta4 the momeat Congress passss beyond tbe lias if providing for the waota of tbe Government, nj deciding the purposes of tbe war, to my aowlt aball be conducted, the whole thing will sro*i a failure* No one, we are aure, will suspect the pnn« occupant of the Presidential cbair of ssy dis position unduly to magnify his offiee, aad, at a time when such momentous concerns »rt com mitted tobie discretion and oversight in tke daily administration of tho duties aeesauijr imposed on him aa tbe Chief Magistrate of tbs Nation, there must be little room for say tetsp. tation in thia direction. Yet with a proper •pect for tbe incumbent obligations of his poA tion, ss well aa from regard for. tbe propriety* with which tbat position ia "hedged about" by tho allotmenta of tbe Constitution, it Is evidaa tbat tbe President cannot abdicate the exsn tive functions with which he is charged by ths supremo law of tbe land, and any attempt oa tbe part of the legislative branch to direct or supervise tbe military movements of the Adab istration would introduce confusion and petyia ity into all tbe operations of the war at a tias when most of all unity of will is necessary ts their successful issue. There is danger of dissension, it would ma, only upon a single topic—the disposition thst shall be made of Slavery in tbe conduct of tho upending campaign. It is not i pretended tbat any accruing ex%et ciee of the military service, or any experieocH derived from tbe progress of tbe war up to this point, imperatively call for the dogmatic defini tion of a policy on tbe subject different froa tbat which bas already been propounded by Congress at its late extraordinary session. And yet, In the name of "military necessity," there are a few who insist upon extreme and radical measures of Congrenioiial declaration under this head, as though the attainment of the end pro posed could be expedited by legal formula or tbe codification of any number of aets that shall be duly inserted in the forthcoming edition of the Statutes at Large. But what are tbe "mili tary neoessitiee" which constrain the legislative action tbua demanded by a few Where, when and w have these "necessities" been demon strated? Or, if their existence be admitted, who is the judgu of them—Gen. McClellau and the officers of oor armies, or a majority of Cos gress To plain minds it would seem to be a plain propoeition that "military necessities might be most prudently determined by tboss wbo have made the art of war a study aad a profession. We would not have our readers infer that these suggestions are prompted by any misgiv ings with regard to the temper and dispositioa of a majority of the present Congreas in regard to the present prosecution ef tbe war. In the presence of the manifold and imperative con siderations which plead for the preservation of tbat harmony and unity of counsel which aos subsist throughout tbe loyal States, it would bs a grave disparagement alike to tbe wisdom and patriotism of the People's Representatives ts suppose that, through any agency of theirs, ths vigor of the Executive and military arm of ths Republic should be paralyzed by disputes re specting the theory on which the war shall he conducted. If the persistent hostility of ths Seceded States should make it necessary, in ths language of some, "to carry the war into the heart of Slavery," the victorious march of oor armies would not be greatly accelerated by an theoretical and universal edicts of emancipation, which would not be worth the paper they were written on, except so far as they might be en forced by tbe superior power of the nation.— Powerless for good to the slave, tbey would on ly serve to intenaify tbe hatred and stiffen tbe armed opposition which stand alike in the way of the objects proposed to themselves by every clsss among the supporters of tbe war. A wsr for the Union may aa one of its poseible inaf dents or consequents, conduct to emancipation in part or in whole. A war for emancipat** would, according to all the probabilities that occur to our mind, result only in the disap pointment of the hopes rested on this basis, while at the same time proving fatal to the hopes of thoee who, with the President, "keep tbe in tegrity of the Union prominent aa tbe primary object of the contest."—[Nat Intelligencer.
