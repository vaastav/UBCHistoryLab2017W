How will exempted congressmen know when it "hurts"? The prospect of "lightless nights" is not as cheerless as it seems. The owl family may dis cover, even in the darkness, that home is more than a place to sleep in. 1 The practice of auto drivers rushing past street cr stopped at crossings continues piling up trouble for those who take the risk. Better lose a minute than win a damage suit. Senator La Follette explains that absence from the senate prevented him from voting against the Austrian war declaration. But why explain? The country understands and knows why. More caution and less haste in auto driving insures arrival at the destination without the ex pense and subsequent worries of financing hos pital cases. The deeper that truth sinks in the greater the safety. But every question propounded to General Crozier by the senate carried a back-hitting boomerang on the vaunted champion of the kaiser's bill to make it impossible for our army to get guns at all by putting all our munitions factories out of business. Judging by the volume of publicity, defiance of fuel regulation prevails to larger degree in Philadelphia than in other large cities. Operators whose policy centered in taking all the traffic would bear experience real hardship in loosen ing their grip, even to win the war. Supporters of the volunteer system see in the present rush to recruiting offices an argument in favor of their pet system. So it would appear by ignoring the impelling motive. The volun teers, foreseeing the inevitable, choose sclectivj service and head off selective draft. Certain canners of food products have been called on the official carpet to explain why they hoard their goods. Officials suspect the reason, but prefer first hand knowledge. Moreover, since Commissioner Murdock added a can opener to his tools, all Washington eagerly awaits a try- out. Ccunty Bonded Indebtedness. The repo. t of the state auditor touching the ' bonded indebtedness' of Nebraska counties pre- j ! sents some interesting phases. It reveals the ! I fart that two-thirds of tile counties of the state j have no bonded indebtedness and that the debts j of only five exceed a hundred thousand dollars ! each. Five others show bonded indebtedness of eighty to ninety thousand, while the rest have mortgaged their property for various amounts down to a minimum of six thousand dollars. Nearly every county having voted bonds for public improvements is very productive and rich in natural resources and, computed upon the ba sis of the actual or assessed valuation of taxable property, every one of the counties is well able to support the debt incurred and to liquidate it in good time. A cursory analysis of the statement indicates the taxpayers of Nebraska counties have exer cised unusual moderation in the matter of mort gage indebtedness. The showing is very good evidence of the antipathy of the farming element to the specter of debt, be it public or private. The aggregate bonded debt of the counties named is $.1,778,887, which is a small sum compared with that which these counties are able to sustain should they desire to do so. Thus we see that the financial condition of Nebraska counties as political entities is excel lent. The presumption is that most of these debts were incurred for the promotion of pub lic improvements, including public buildings, good roads and drainage projects. It is to be predicted that Nebraska counties will continue to put more money in the improvement of the main highways of the state from year to year, since the farmers as well as the townfolks are advocating better roadways. This subject, by the way, was discussed recently in a convention of the State Association of County Commissioners and Supervisors, which for the first time invited the state engineers to become members in or der to facilitate the joint plans of the state and county for the betterment of roadways. The auditor's report shows, too, that the vot ers who control the policy of counties respecting the matter of going into debt are able to hold tight reins upon public officials, thus keeping the limits of debt within reason. The net result should not be lost upon the voters of our cities and towns which have often shown a disposition to plunge the people into heavy bonded indebt edness until the legal limit is not only reached, but exceeded. Keys to the Mysterious House By Frederic J. Haskin Washington, Dec. 15. So far Colonel E. M. House is known to the public chiefly as a man of myaery one whose thoughts and motives are unknown, whose movements are secret or obscure. This quality of reticence lias brought him more fame than could volumes of lan guage, because it is so rare. Most of our pub licists have made something of an art of self explanation, sometimes even drawing upon his tory to help the common man to an under standing of their characters. likening themselves modestly to Jefferson or Lincoln. Colonel House seems to resemble no one but himself. His unique place in the public mind has been gained largely by the simple expedient of keeping his mouth shut when so many others are open. Most of the sketches of him so far have been elaborations of tin's fact, with the added information that he lives in Texas, where he deals in lands and "makes" governors, senators and cabinet officers for recreation. These things he apparently accomplishes by thel same silent and inscrutable method that he applies to the problems of European diplomacy. He wants nothing for himself, and gets it. He has noth ing to say, and says it. He is quiet as a rub ber heel, elusive as a lost collar button. Inci dentally, he does not seem quite human, as limned by most of his recent biographers; he stands forth as a selfless image of cryptic reticence. I 

TODAY I Right in the Spotlight. Sir Robert U Borden, the fate of whose administration is at stake in , the Dominion elections today, has j been premier of Canada since 1911. j .Sir Robert was born on a farm at , historic Grand. I're, Nova Scotia, in 154. He is a descendant of a family of New Enplanders who left Connecti- j cut at the time of the American revo- i lution, being loyal to England, and went to settle in the Province of Nova I Scotia. The future premier was edu- ! eated in Nova Scotia, made law his j profession, and In 1 S 9 6 made his de- but in the Dominion parliament. In lHul he became leader of the con- ' servative opposition and continued as j such until he succeeded Sir Wilfred ; Laurier in the premiership. Since the beginning of th" war Sir Robert has j worked unceasingly to keep Canada to the front in loyalty to. England. Politics Makes Postal Inefliclcncy, Omaha. Dec. 15.

Kviriem-e of their confidence is indicated in But if the man will not talk of himself, his friends will occasionally talk of him, and there is beginning to grow up a little body of House legends, which are passed from mouth to mouth and occasionaly blossom into print. These stories reveal the suprising facts that House is a great story-teller, an enthusiastic hunter, and a typical Texan, who regards Texas as a special province of God, proves every argument by a Texas example, and uses a Texas date line on his letterhead even when he is in Rerlin or London. Under these rays of light, the House image begins to look more human, but several more im- j portant facts have gotten into circulation, which j seem to be keys to at least some parts of the i House mystery. Thus, starting at the begin- j ning. we learn that Ins father, Thomas William House, was an Englishman, who settled in Texas, built a manorial mansion, and lived like an English country gentlemen, devoting his time to farming and sports, for which the Texas wild erness was then a virgin field. On this Texas estate, modeled after an English manor, were entertained many .Englishmen and other for eigners, and there Colonel E. M. House first met many of the British officers and diplomats with whom he is now dealing in Europe. In Omaha Thirty Years Ago.

The depressed state of the bond market struck the Board of Education of St. Louis in a tender spot Building projects under way necessitated the sale of $300,000 of an issue of $3,000,000 of 4 pe cent school bonds, and the best price ob tainable was 90.53. The interest rate accounts for some of the slump, but gilt edge issues carry ing 5 and 6 per cent sell below par. These conditions applaud the wisdom of the Omaha school board ;in keeping out of the bond market. Two Rival American Kings Baltimore T-rlran Way back before the civil war the contest ,07 """St. place in the farm industries of the United States between cotton' and corn began. , The contest is not yet decided. There have been years when corn looked an easy winner, but wnn King Cotton convinced the United States and the rest of the world concerning the immense food value of the cottonseed there was a moveup m the cotton score, and, notwithstanding the bigness of the corn yield this year, it is by no means certain that the 1917 corn crop represents Keattr n-round value than the 1917 cotton yield. Each of these crops has a value far be yond what is apparent on the face of the returns. From the cottonseed is made a table oil that is substituted for olive oil and a cooking fat that is substituted largely for lard. Also, there is the cottonseed cake, prized highly as a cattle and pig food, thousands of tons of which are exported to cattle-growing countries. It is said, also, that cottonseed meal is being used extensively as a mixture with beef in the manufacture of hot dogs, and that ginger snaps are being made of cottonseed flour. But corn also has a by-product commodity that scores into millions of dollars for the side line values. This refers not alone to the foods prepared from the grain, but mainly to the value of the corn leaves or blades, as a hay crop. Corn fodder is the main fare for cattle dur ing the winter months ' wherever corn is grown. This fodder has as great food value for horses and cattle as timothy hay. Beef, milk, cream, butter and cheese are, to an extent not commonly known by city consumers, but trans mutations of corn fodder. .It is an abstruse question as to whether corn or cotton is king. The Study of German. While every intelligent and patriotic Amer ican must agree that our public schools, and our private schools, too, for that matter, must not be used to propagate subversive alien ideas or promote disloyal sentiments through the teach ing of the. German language, common sense does not prescribe complete cessation of the study of German or refusal to use the German lan guage where it can be put to good and desirable use. All languages, we must remember, are but devices for communication of thought and it is only the evil use of the German language, its abuse to build little kaiser-worshiping Ger manics in free America, that must be stopped. The best discussion of the study of German in the light of present war conditions that has come to our notice is this from the annual re port of President Butler to the trustees of Co lumia university: "For a generation past the German language and literature have been widely taught in the schools and colleges of the United States. In some parts of the country the study of Ger man has been given a preferred position by law or by municipal action. A first effect of the war has been to arouse a shrp antagonism to the study" of German, for obvious reasons. At a time when passions are stirred, and justly so, by the shocking outrages that have been committed by German agents in the name of the German government and the German peo ple, it is not easy to reason calmly about a matter of this kind. Nevertheless, there are certain ruling principles which should be pointed out. "No country can have a homogeneous or a safe basis for its public opinion and its insti tutions unless those rest upon the foundation of a single language. To protect the national unity and security no community should be permitted to substitute any other language for English as the basis and instrument of common school education. Instruction in a foreign language should, however, always be provided, since, as Goethe subtly said, to know but one language is not to know any. Whether that foreign language should be French, or Spanish, or German, or Latin is a matter to be deter mined in accordance with varying circum stances and differing needs. So far as German is concerned, it is unfortunately true that its study has been urged and emphasized in some parts of the United States, not because of the intrinsic value of the German language and its literature, but rather as part of a persistent political propaganda intended to wean the American people from their Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Critic origins and to. divide their na tional interest and national sympathy. Wher ever thi propaganda has been attempted, or wherever it may again be attempted, it should be ruthlessly stamped out as a wrong com mitted against our national unity and our na tional integrity. "When this point is guarded there can be no reasonable question not only as to the desirability, but as to the necessity of contin uing the study of the German language, Ger man literature aiid German history when this war shall end. There are, perhaps. 1 .'0.000,000 people in the world who speak German. They constitute an intelligent, a highly organized and a powerful group, and they will continue to do so even when defeated. It will certainly be the hope and the purpose of the American people to live in peace and concord with them when thev shall have admitted their wrong doing in fomenting and in carry on this war, and when they shall have accepted those ideas and ideals of political life and social progress "which animate the rest of the world. More o:r, should Germany again go wrong, wo must be prepared to appeal from the materialistic and force-worshiping Germany of today to the Germany of Herder and of Kant, of Goethe and of Schiller. We must be able to appeal from the modern German barbarism to earlier German poetry, and from modern German hymns of hate to the beautiful music of her masters of song. A prophet with ministerial connections in New York takes his outgivings seriously enough to print and mail out a sheet warning the world to prepare for three and a half more years of war. Looks like a pretty tough sentence for human ity, but since the prophet prophecies the death oMhe kaiser and the devil at the finish doubt less the spectator will patiently bear the delay for such an admirable climax. While the chase for "slacker dollars' is on wastage of good money in political campaigns deserves attention. The fusion campaign in New York cost over $1,000,000 and two rivals for the mayoralty of Pittsburgh burned up $170,000. A turn or two of the conservation roller in these localities or a dollar-for-dollar war tax would contribute mightily to public morals and safety. , Young House was a crack shot, a daring rider, and loved the outdoors as do all westerners. His youth and young manhood, his formative years, were spent largely on the prairies and in the mountains with summer visits to London and the continent. The roots of whatever quali ties a man develops may usually be found in his early manhood, and perhaps Colonel House may be interpreted as a westerner, who has spent much of his life in the great outdoors, and has acquired the calm and reserve which such a life nearly always inculcates. Talk did not count for much in the west 40 years ago. A- man was called upon to keep his mouth shut and do tilings. Colonel House seems to be still using that formula. House was educated at Cornell university and maue a special study ot economics. He has I remained a student all his life, lames Hryce, long British ambassador to the United States, and an author of note, is credited with the state- j ment that House writes "as pure Addisonian English" as lie has ever read. House seems to have used this faculty chiefly in his correspond ence, although he has been accused of writing a book. This is all the direct evidence that we can j find as to the man's intellectual attainments. '"or in nu uiic in puunc me wno nas so sedulously refrained from putting himself on record.

He had observed the struggles and enterprises of Wilson in New Jersey politics, and remarked to Colonel Bryan, who has long been his- friend and hunting com panion, that Wilson seemed to be a real pro gressive. "How docs he strike you?" House asked. "Every time he gets a chance," replied the great Ncbraskan with a rueful smile. He was thinking of the famous "cocked hat letter," of which he was already aware, although the pub lic was not. Nevertheless he gave House a let ter to Wilson, and they met at the Gotham hotel in New York.
