It is evident that the rublic at large desires to do what It can to make up in friendly sentiment and good wishes for the future, the monetary loss sus tained by Frank .Grimes. AVhen asked how he felt after the reaction of giving up so much money, Mr. Grimes said today: "There is little use of talking about it now. It is over, and I intend to con tinue making an honest living for my self and family. Perhaps 1 may in time retrieve the loss of this money, but if I do not I will continue to live. I did what I thought was right, and no man deserves any credit for doing what he wants to. Although this was hard on me financially, I wanted to do it. and it was done after due delibera tion not on the strength of a sudden whim. "It does me good to meet friends, acquaintances and even strangers, who commend my course. Men who tnly know me by sight- have stopped me on the street and told me that they endorsed my action. My friends all agree that I did right in making good the treasury loss, and I meet with norhing but approval on all sides. "A sample of the general senti ment." continued Mr. Grimes, "came to me today in the shape of a letter, which. on account of its source, pleases me more than anything else." Mr. Grimes then produced a short note from Rev. S. S. Estey, pastor of the First Presbyterian church. The note was brief, and to the point. It read: "My Dear Grimes: You are all right and here's my hand. I am proud of vou and vou'r deef. S. S. ESTEY." Having purchased the Topeka Coal Co.'s interest in their "West 10th St. of fice.

What would you do if you were a member of a church congregation which owed the pastor 440 back salary and you didn't have the money and the pas tor wanted his money right away? Would you put a mortgage on the church for $440 to raise the money? Would you? Some of the congregation of the col ored B street Baptist church say yes. They will decide finally at a meeting to be held this evening. The B street Bap tist church is located in North Topeka near the banks, not of the Jordan, but of the Kansas rl-er. It is one of the flourishing congrega tions of the city, that is at least from the point of numbers if not in the pock etbook. But while this mortgage looms up portentously there is an over shad owing cloud of differences existing be tween factions in the church, some of them opposed to the pastor G. W. Harts and others supporting him. Harts claims that $440 is due him on back salary. The debt seems to be a just one for no one denies that the amount is due. The question seems to be over the manner of Its payment. Mr. Harts says he wants it now and doesn't think that he should be made to wait for it. He states that he won't give up his pastorate until the back salary due him is paid over. J. M. Dorsey of 116 West Sixth ave nue states that a proposition was made to Harts to pay $2 50 down with $20 a month until the debt is paid in full. Harts states that this Is untrue and that such an offer was never made to him. He shoulders the whole blame for the trouble which has been stirred up on Mrs. Sailie Barker and a few others who are members of the church. "Mrs. Barker tried to get me to re sign without paying my salary," said Harts. "I helped them pay off the mortgage they had on the church and then came back and agreed to help them raise the money that was due me. It amounts to $439.85. Mrs. Barker and about six others tried to get me to resign before my salary was paid, but I refused to do this. The whole trouble is due to this Mrs. Bar ker, the church board and the church itself officially, never asked me to re sign. I am going to quit when I get my money but not before. I have an other place In view here in Topeka when I quit." "Two-thirds of the congregation want Rev. Harts to tender his resignation as pastor, and the pastor has declared that he wouldn't pastor such a gang of heathen another month under any cir cumstances," says J. M. Dorsey. "He and a few stand pat friends are making an effort to mortgage the church to raise the money to pay him dues. This meeting will be held tonight to decide this mortgage business, and then the trouble comes." "Dorsey is not a member of the church and what he saya isn't true," said Harts.

PRICE STORE out of the accumulation of great for tunes. This subject will be considered tomorrow. "No subject can bring greater good to this country if correctly solved," said he. "Or greater harm If, for wise and Just taxation, punitive spoliation and thi destruction of our boundless spirit of enterprise through hamper ing regulations be substituted." Government by injunction was char acterized by Mr. Belmont as "another burning subject to be discussed." He said he was not - sure that President Roosevelt's proposition for com pulsory investigation of industrial dis turbances is advisable. He doubted the wisdom ' of government interference but the greatest justification for such a policy would be in the case of quasi public corporations. Mr. Belmont also called attention to that portion of President Roosevelt's message, wherein the president de nounced the effort to prohibit all com binations of capital. The federation then took up the government by injunction. Carl Spel ling, general attorney for the Ameri can Federation of Labor, said that in labor disputes judges have set forth decrees which were special legislation and have paralyzed and rendered abortive all the efforts on the part of the labor side of that dispute. An In junction he said, should never be granted except to protect property rights. It wag deplrirahle, said Mr. Spelling, that men sTloufd be advised to commit crimes, but more deplorable if irre sponsible men on the bench are to be allowed to-'Usurp authority above the law and become unrestrained despots; to take one side in every trade dis pute, to decide ex-parte that hundreds and thousands of men are about to violate' the law and send for these special decrees to paralyze and destroy the rights of ail these men. "That is 'the most dangerous tendency in our government. If these vicious and far reaching precedents are to be rec ognized Of permitted to go on building mere on top of these they will soon con stitute and erect-a. power as despotic as that which, -destroyed Rome." He declared that it was very seldom strikers ever resort to actual violence but that they frequently appoint com mittees to help the police preserve the peace. The speaker said the Pearce bill which is before congress embodies the proper and legitimate demands of organized labGr. 

THINKS IT WAS SHIELDS. Xew Theory About Identity of Great Bend Bank Robber. Attorney Nlrdlinger of Leavenworth, says he is convinced that the man who held up and robbed the Great Bend bank and was later captured, is Wilmot Shields, who was released from the federal penitentiary a few days ago, after serving a year for the robbery of the postofflce at Quenemo, Kansas. Attorney Nlrdlinger was appointed by the court to defend Shields, who was charged with blowing the postofflce safes at Quenemo and Great Bend. Shields confessed to the Quenemo rob bery, and the other charge was dis missed. If Attorney Nlrdlinger is right in his surmise, there will be no trouble in identifying the prisoner. Wilmot Shields was committed to the Shawnee county Jail September 11, 1D03, for postofflce robbery, and was sent to Leavenworth October 15, 1903. His description in the jail record Is: Age 25, height 5 9V4, eyes blue, hair light. Carl Lawson, jailor In charge at the n - n ft make your own selections easy. aoies or Men s.

WOMAN CAR CONDUCTORS. Their Employment In Chilean Toivn Attend Well to Their Work. The most remarkable feature of the Valparaiso street car system is its con ductors; they are women. The sex is also employed in like capacity In San tiago and all the other cities of Chile that have horse or electric trama. This practice sprang into being at the time of the revolution of 1891, when men and money were scarce and women plentiful. Having apparently given satisfaction to their employers during the intervening years, they are stiM retained. ' The first woman conductors were said to have been young : and pretty and to have been dressed in natty uni forms. Tradition even goes further and says that at that time youth and good looks were a part of the "en trance requirements." In the light of the present this seems hard to believe. It is also recorded that after a while the natty uniforms were dropped and it is just possible that the apochryphal "youth and beauty" clause was strick en out at the same time. Today, judging from what I have seen in a somewhat painstaking sur vey of the situation, I would say that the possession of youth and beauty, far from "being' s requirement. was now the means of earning a Hat dis qualification. The customary dress Of a lady tram conductor of today Is a broad-brimmed slouch hat, a short jacket with the sleeves turned back an inch or two. and a short block skirt, always hanging with a heavy port or starboard list. They are neither flirtatious nor prudish, and no scandals aro heard about tUro-- To .a foreigner It Is an Interesting sight to observe the street car girl, to note how capably she manages her car, and the quiet, busi nesslike way in which she goes through the routine of collecting fares, giving change, discharging passenger, and seeing that the rule regarding the number admitted it not broken.
