Fiom tbe New York Tribune. j The Coal-Fielda of Pe»i>*a. IIAZLETON, Luzerne Co.. Pa., ) November 28,1863. j Yesterday morning at 11 o'clook. we took the cars of the Beaver Meadow Iload | at Mauch Chunck. bound for this place. The road is one of the most romantic and wild, so far as scenery is concerned, of auy that 1 have seen yet. We wind in Rud out around the base of the mountains, following the course of the Lehigh all the way. From Weatherly onto llazleton Creek Bridge, a distance of two milea, our course is steadily upward. Our {jood old steam horse ahead snorts and j'ufl's in. i»t furiously. We are ascending a grade nil the way of 144 feet to the mile—prob ably the heaviest grade upon any road in the country. At the Bridge we change. 1 and take the llazleton road going onto j Kckley, where passengers goiug to White Haven or Wilkesbarre are again transfer red. From Kckley we are backed down J to the bridge again, and then run up to j Hazloton. We pass all along the road i large locomotives running down to the Chunk, drawing behind them cars hold ing from O,oi)d to 10,000 pounds of coal. Tbe passenger car of our train is full.— The passengers are nearly all miners or their families, or the parties leasing the mines. The entire population, not only here, but all the way from Easton, speak Pennsylvania l>uteh.a lingo a New York Dutchman would never understand. Ido not wish to be understood as saying that no English is spoken, because nearly all speak more or less of it, but simply that it would be almost fruitless in any town through here for a storekeeper, or one ex pecting to do business, to settle unless he could talk Pennsylvania Dutch. At llazleton we find the mines of A. Pardee & Co., the oldest, and probably the wealthiest firm in this section of the State. They have under their control, and are working at this time, some six mines. At Jeddo, some two or three miles beyond Hazleton, are the Mines of (I. B. Markle it Co. Those mines, with those at this point I shall consider and speak of in most instances as one. they being so to all prac tical purposes, the firm at Jeddo being to some extent a branch of A. Pardee & Co. The<e two firms will this year forward 460,- 000 tuns from their mines; a large in crease over last year. During the past Summer they have shipped about 11,000 tuns per week, and in no instance have they satisfied the orders of a single man. • The same causes have operated hen; as at Mauch Chunk, to hinder the fall working of the mines. The difficulties have at these points, however. '>een much greater than at any other portion of the State. Strikes have been frequent, and in conse quence thereof the productions have di miuishc' about 50,000 tuns from what thev otherwise might have been. Trans portation has also been lacking. Wages have been increased enormously. At the llazleton mines the miners formerly re-I ceived from -ij to 5J cent.- per car for ! mining. Each miner's car holds about a j tun. These men are now receiving from j 75 cents to t*l per cur. Laborers inside I the mines are now receiving about double from last year's prices. At the Jeddo mines 6d cents per car was formerly paid ' the miners, whereas they arc now receiv ing 81 for the same quantity. Their j wages have been raised some six or eight j different times. Some of the men are making from 85 to 810 per day. Com- I moil laborers arc averaging 815 a week ■ for simply loading the cars. Such are some of the obstacles against which the ; owners have been*obliged to contend, and [ vet these are but slight compared to those ; 1 shall now consider. The miners are I composed of Welsh, Gftfman and English, \ and Protestant ami Catholic Irish—the latter class have been at the bottom of all the troubles, set on and abetted by the va- I rious outside small fry Democratic Copper- ! head politicians of the State. The men commenced by forming themselves into an ! organization styled, '-The Buckshots," having for its avowed aim and purpose in sistence to the draft. Arms were furnish ed them from Philadelphia, by a Copper head politician of Ike Shite, at 81 50 a I piece , they giving security for the safe re- ! turn of tbe pieces. Thank God that this 1 man has lately been arrested by the inili- , tary stationed here, and sent onto Head ing. there to await the action of the au thorities.' I wonder if some of our poli ticians, and journals as well, won't soon be calling it an "■arbitrary arrest?" Per haps they have already done so. From a resistance to the draft they soon assumed the position that none but men of their own nationality and religious faith should be al lowed to work in the mines at all, and at the same time demanded an increase of wa ges. Seeing the state of affairs,the owners at once commenced discharging, one by one. these men. As each mail was discharged, all the ''Buckshots" would quit work, and not a thing was touched until the man j was returned to his position. Not only this, but they drove by force all others from their work, thus completely paralyz ing all operations. The conscqucnco was that the men discharged had to be again reinstated, or all oj>erations were at an end. Men belonging to the '• Buckshots " were ofteutinies sent for to proceed to other mines, sometimes eight or ten miles dis tant, and help there to carry out the same programme. Strikes then became the order of the day, and came frequently.— Their demands were obliged to be acceded to, or no work could be done. Threats I were made against the lives of the owners. I Soiue of them were shot.souie killed, oth- - ers tired at wherever they appeared. The : lives of the owners and overseers were un- 1 safe, and also those of their families. The daughters of Mr. Pardee were overtaken upon the road an 1 stopped by these men | who demanded 85 from each. After much cntieaty. an 1 int ; ruin.' them that they had uo money with them, the ladies were al- \ lowed to proceed a short distance, but were ngaiu stopped by the same parties, who in sisted u|ion having the amount. The young ladieajlnally escaped them, and the men were arrested. Upon being taken before the Luzerne county court then sit ting in the vicinity, the "Grand Jury de clined to find an indictment against them, and they were released. I presume it is ; needless to add that the Jury was Copper- ! head to the core. The men, when arrest ed, were defcuded by small shy storing i Democratic lawyers. In fact, the plan was one simply to obtain control of the i Wines, drive away the proprietors, and | t«sb of tbe work i*ou a a were not mem-: berg of their organization, and then by force of aims prevent all work being done, and thus by stopping the coal from being furnished to.the Government, these poor, deluded creatures, the tools of men cring ing to them for their votes (and here let me say tha>, if needed, satisfactory evi dence can be obtained that from 100 to 200 illegal votes were cast in the town of llazleton alone, at the recent election), hoped to obtain exemption from the draft. Truly, the fools are not all dead yet. One more instance, and I will drop the subject. G. 1!. Markle. Esq., the proprietor of the Jeddo mines, while riding on the road in his carriage, was several times shot at in broad daylight. Several balls were put through the top of his buggy, and three passed through his hat. This gentleman was particularly marked by tbe " Buck shots," owing to his firm refusal, in many instances to accede to their demands.— Such, very briefly, was the state of affairs when a company or two of the 10th New Jersey were ordered here. Previously the men controlled the mines, but now the proprietors are once more gaining.although very slowly, the ascendency over them.— Strange, indeed, is the respect these''Buck shots " have for our veteran troops. A company of fifty men at any one point is sufficient to awe them at once into submis sion. Some one or two hundred arrests have been made, and hundreds have fled from the mines through fear. At Jeddo, where formerly the Catholic Irish out numbered the other nationalities three to one, the others are now in a majority. It will, however, be necessary to keep troops on hand throughout the district during the entire Winter. By so doing hundreds of these men will be forced to leave for other regions in order to obtain a livelihood, and their formidable organization will, it is hoped, thus become broken up and dis banded." A few words now as to the cost of get ting the coal to market. The net cost for the labor of mining, at tbe Jeddo mines, is about 81 25 per tun. The net cost of a tun delivered in the New York market, is from 8-'! 75 to 84. The average price obtained for their coal is about 85. At the llazleton mines not a tun has been sold for over 85 HO. Thus I think it will be readily seen that the coal operators here arc free from all charges of combining to keep the price of coal up. If any such combination exists, it lies with the middle men, as they are termed, to whom the pro ducers sell. No one who has not been here and seen and learned of the diffiuel ties that arc in the way of the owners of the mines, can have any idea of the state of things as they exist. The owners have lost all control of their mines and over their men, and it is the sincere prayer of many, ay. most of them, that the price of coal may fall in order that the price of wages may with it decrease, and that they may thus regain their past control* 'l'hev feel intensely, the delicateucss of their po sition. The cure and anxiety of mind that they possess is dragging tliein down very rapidly. They all go heavily armed, not knowing when they leave their fami lies in the morning that they shall ever return to them again alive. I said, in my last letter, that i would endeavor to state here, for the benefit of inquirers, wheth er there was any hope that the price of coal would fall, and if so, when; so 1 must not close without noticing it.l can only say that 011 this question the coal men are divijkd. No one can tell anything defi nite lwd>out it. The present price is an unhealthy one. It is one which I have shown has been brought about by au un healthy state of afiairs. The demand is far greater for it than is the supply that can be furnished. It is the natural re suit of this fact, together with the state of affairs at the mines. It is something that at present seems beyond control. A large proportion of the advance is chargeable to the teachings of the so-called Democratic party, who have been instigating the mi ners and laborers to assume thoir present position, in hopes (vain men of thereby materially " aiding the Government in a vigorous prosecution of the war," by stop ping its supply of coal, and preventing the enforcement of the draft. Some seem to think that it will not be long ere coal will fall if they are allowed to work their mines to their full capacity. Others seem to think that the demand is so great that it may be months ere they will be able to supply it. All, hail with satisfaction the recent low sales at auction in New York. GEN. 

BANKS IN MATAMORAS.—After the capture of Brownsville, Gen. Banks paid an official visit to the American con sul at Matamoras. The Mexicans, hav ing previously learned of his intention to ! do so. decided to give him a public re j eeption, of which we find an account in I the New Orleans Times. A deputation | was dispatched to invite him to the public j hall. The military were paraded, a salute j was fired, and all the enthusiasm of a ga |la day was manifested. Speeches were j made by Srs. Argues, Cortina and others. | expressing their sympathy with the Fed | era I cause in the United States, and their I belief that the result would be favorable | to the cause represented by Gen. Banks. ! Genera! Banks replied, hoping that Mex ! ico would come out of her present trou ; bles triumphantly ; and after a great ma ! Ny mutual expressions of friendship and | sympathy, the party adjourned to the of fice of the American consul. 

FORTRESS MONROE, Dec. 14th inst.— The following has been received, dated Yorktuu-n, Va.. Dec. 14. To Major Gcncrul Butler : —I have the satisfaction to announce the complete success of the exjjidition sent out uuder Col. West. All worked in successful combination. Our cavalry carried the enemy's camp at Charles City Court Bouse, after sharp fighting, the enemy firing from their hou ses. We captured eight officers and eigh ty-two men, being the whole command, (three companies.) fifty-five horses, and three mules, besides many small arms.&e., left on the ground. The enemy's camp, with its equipments, ammunition and pro visions. were all thoroughly destroyed.— Our loss is, Capt. Gregory severely wo«nd ed, one sergeant and one" eorporal killed, and four men wounded. All are entitled to high commendation for gallantry and unflinching endurance, and Col. West es pecially, for his precise execution of a difficult combination, by which alone he could have accomplished my object. Signed. J. J W ITTAR. Brig. Gen.

FOtt PRESIDENT IN 1804 : AltltlHAtt LIXC'OLX. Tilt' Impt'iitling Ih-al'l. As the time approaches which has been fixed for making the impending draft, those likely to bo effected by it naturally begin to feel uneasy. This uneasiness is increased somewhat, by the knowledge of the fact that Congress is now in session, and is even now debating tbe propriety of making some changes in the law. 'j he present law, at the tiuic of its passage, was generally believed to be fair, but when it was reduced to practice, many im perfections were thought to be diseover el by some. Amendments have*already been reported by the Militaay committee of the Senate, and are now being consid ered by that body. One of these propo ses to strike out the distinction created by the present law, between the two classes, and thereby placing all able bodied men between the ages of twenty-one and forty five, in the same class. Another proposes to strike out the commutation clause.— This clause, we believe, was opposed by the Democratic side of the House wlieu the bill was on its passage. It has been used by that party ever since it became a law for the purpose of bringing the whole law into disfavor, and whether it is right or wrong, so great is the prejudice of the people against it now, that its repeal seems to be a necessity. Conscripted service, at tbe best, is unpleasant. It is our duty therefore, to yield a cheerful obedience to whatever just laws Congress may pass on the subject. There can be 110 law 011 this subject but what will work great hardship to some. Let us yield strict obedience to the law ourselves, and encourage others to do likewise. Whether the proposed changes will become a part of the law be fore the pending draft is made or not, it is impossible to say. We think it probable that some of them will. THE 

SITUATION. 111 a great ;ivil strife like that in which we have bijjjii engaged for more than two years past, the scene undergoes many changes. Before the first Bull Run dis aster, wo were full of hope—after the treachery of Patterson brought that hu miliation upon us, all nas gloom—sadness pervaded every loyal heart. So too when McClellau'sgrand army pitched their tents' in front of Yorktown ; all were confident; all were cheerful. But after the " seven day's battle," how changed! Not ouly were the unconditional loyalists disap pointed, and therefore, to some extent, discouraged, but those who were not so devotedly faithful, embraced every fresh reverse to our arms, to stir up a feeling of hostility to the Administration. By them the Administration was held responsible for our Bull Bun disaster, having forced that battle on too soon; when in truth it should have been fought ten days sooner, and it would have been a glorious victory as it was, had Patterson obeyed orders.— By them also, the Administration was at fault for not sufficiently reinforcing Mc- Clellan, although all that was possible to be done in that behalf without leaving Washington to the tender mercies of Lee, a; ! his rebel army, was done. While Vallandigham, Voorehees, and thoir co-laborers were always hostile to the war for the Union, they were still more defiant and vindictive after each reverse to our arms. They saw in every reverse irretrievable disaster. In every question that seemed to require diplomatic solu tion, they saw a foreign war. Every blun der of a commander in the field—every mistake of an agent, in whatever depart ment he might be, TO laid upon the shoulders of the President, and his advi sers ; nor did their immediate removals make amends. For then, it would be de clared to be political persecution. Thus, while the prca:vit Administration has. from the beginning, had to struggle with a gigantic rebellion, covering about one third of the whole country. It ha also h; d to contend with a '• fire in the rear." which being for the most part, masked in the robes of Loyalty, was the more dangerous. While the great body of the people of the loyal States, without distinction, were rallying around the '• powers that be," and wishing them God speed, these men were watching the signs of the times, hoping for something to turn up favora ble to their disloyal purposes. Thus, when we won a great victory, such as the occupation of. New' Orleans, they could see nothing particularly encouraging in itj it was a barren success, aud the dis tinguished General, to whom it surren dered, has-over since been the subject of their animadversions and abuse. While on the other hand, a defeat has always been hailed by this same class of patriot*. ' as an evidence of our entire inability to conquer the rebellion—with theui on such occasions, the only question was whether they would not conquer us. And thus it was, that in the fall of 1862, while half a million of the uncondi tional Unionist* were absent from the polls fii;hting the open enemies of our common country; they, by stirring the< prejudices of some, and arousing the fears of others, stole a march on the Adminis tration—carried a few of the elections, and then claimed it as a victory of the people against the policy of tlic Adminis tration. Imboldcncd by their success they at last unmask themselves and declare in favor of withdrawing our armies—of grant ing an armistice, and of doing every thiug else necessary to successfully interfere with a vigorous prosecution of the war. But, although they had carried the elections in a number of the States, still, with the ex ception of New York, their victories were barren of any practical result. The Union party, composed of Republicans and War Democrats, still holding control of one or more departments of the State gov ernments. In New York it was otherwise. Having succeeded in one campaign, they at once began to prepare for another; even in our own county, as elsewhere, the people who had but lately been addressed by men of both parties, in behalf of unity and vigor in the prosecution of the war, were nowappealed to, to turn their back up on it; to withhold from it their confidence and their support, assuring' them that it had violated all its pledges; had changed its policy, aud was now i: carrying on an unconstitutional war for the liberation of the negro;" that we could neither look for victory to our arms nor final success to our cause, Bave through the overthrow of the Administration, and the disorganisation of the par y that brought it into power. On the otlier hand, the friends of the Administration, and of the country, well knowing the imminent danger that threat ened us, determined to appeal once more to the people in behalf of their country and iis cause. The contest was a despe rate one. They had to bear the responsi bility of every blunder in the field, or di vision, or alleged division in the Cabinet —the misdoings of selfish contractors— the imbecility or cowardice of unworthy officers, all these they had to bear. The invasion of this State by Lee, was an additional reason urged on behalf of the opposition, the people should speak out against the povers that be; "were the election to come off now," say they, " we would you fifty thousand." Lee's was limited and brief. 1 hanks to Gen. Meade and bis patriotic army. The draft was ordered—its in foroement was discouraged by Gov. Sey mour—his "friends" resisted it—some twenty thousand from the army of the Potomac arc detailed for the purpose of enforcing the law in the Empire State, whose people had always been loyal and patriotic up to the advent of the Seymour dynasty; here the people hail a foretaste of the workings of the policy of thatpar -4y which was promising so much. Or phan Asylums were burned; persons of I all ages and sex became the unfortunate | victims of the excited and brutal mob.— The sight of a patriot wearing the dress of a Union soldier was sufficient to arouse ! their fury, which was only subdued when the unfortunate victim lay helpless at their feet. j Thus, the country was furnished with a | foretaste of tjie fruits of the change of policy so eagerly insisted upon. The enemies of the Administration still pressed forward—tliey were confident— even insulting and defiant, but to their great surprise, they were driven from one battery, then from another, until by a gen eral and final assault, they were driven from the field. The friends of the Government breathe freely once more; the Administration feels safe in the hearts of the loyal people, and the gallant Union army turns itself to it patriotic labor with fresh ardor, knowing that the people are with it, and the result is now before us. Every where the Union cause is steadily advancing. Arkansas, 'lVxas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Xorth Carolina, will all soon be«uoor ed safely in the old Union, and beneath the unsullied emblem of our nationality. The political, as well a# the military, campaign oflßo3, will long bp remembered by those who participated in it—upon it hung the destiny of our country, and thanks to the God of nations, the balance turned* in behalf of national unity and perpetuity. And now that the whole canvass is over, and we are permitted to look back, it is a matter of wonder how thestT politi cians feel, who undertook to " reconstruct" the remains of the old Democratic party into an organization, for the overthrow of a patriotic administration. Doubtless they are astonished at their own folly, and may now exthim: "Wedo 11 wrong, brillß »o nvije-tic&l. To offer it the show of violence.

GEM.—A beautiful sentiment, beautifully expressed, is the following from the Chicaga Journal: "If aman die, shall he live again?" and once a day have the daisies answered it, and "spring's little infant" given its frag rant testimony testified, and yet the world, is murmuring still, "if a man die, shall he live again?" The Realities of Slavery. To the Editor of the N. Y. Tribune. SIR : — During the latter part of June, or first of July, there appeared in Har per's Weekly Journal of Civilization two excellent illustrations, representing some of the real beauties of that " Divine In stitution." as faithfully portrayed upon the bare back of a scourged negro, which was , horribly scarred, and lacerated iu a terri ble manner by the blood-stained whip ofa " driver." The second wood-cut gave a faithful an<J lifelike representation of a negro slave sitting for his photograph, clad in the pe culiar and ragged nondescript habiliments of the plantation, tattered, torn, and bare footed. These engravings were accom panied by a short descriptive account, which very briefly stated that the negro whose bare bade attested the excruciating ordeal of torture through which he had passed, was whipped iu this brutal man ner by an "overseer," as the inhuman "drivers" are delicately called by the ad mirers and devotees of human bondage.— My object in thus referring to these re volting pictures of the real • barbarism of Slavery," at this late day, is to contradict the malicious falsehoods that.havc appear ed iu the Rebel organs of the North. No sooner had this heart-stri<Jcing picture be gun to circulate, and awaken a thrill of horror among the loyal and humane por tion of the community, than the Copper head press at once spit forth their poison ous venom, and boldly asserted that the whole story was a fabrication from begin ning to end—the fruitful results of a fa natical Abolitionist's deluded imagination. This prejudiced and inconsistent state ment was copied into nearly all the l'ro- Slavery organs, for they deemed it a mon strosity that should not go unpunished, notwithstanding Messrs. Harper k Pro. announced that the wood-euts were exact copies from the original photographs, ta ken from life by McPherson it Oliver at Raton Rouge, Pa.. It will thus be seen that not only did these venal sheets en deavor to deride the whole exposure of the outrage, and thereby deceive the public, but they deliberately and willfully attempt ed to cast the stigma of falsity and untrust worthiness upon this loyal and honorable publishing firm. Since the publication of the above pictures in Harper*' Weekly the friends of freedom in New York and Bos ton have purchased " carte dc visite" size photograph copies of the abused negro, as a faithful picture of the realities of Sla very as it exists in the Southern States. Through the mysterious agencies of the camera obseura the most wonderful as well as beautiful results have been ob tained, and it is to the genius and perse verance of Daguerra and M. Niepec that ivc of the nineteenth century to-day be hold the outside view of the moon and the inside view of Slavery, The light of heaven that shoots through well-defined lenses of the camera, and quick as a flash precipitates the outlines of the imago up on the chemically-prepared plate within, cannot and docs not lie. All the logic of the blind and infatuated believers in Hu man Slavery cannot arrest or thwart the progress of truth, any more than they can prevcut tho development of the positive picture, when aided by the silent and powerful process of chemical action. With this much of an explanatory in troduction, permit me to saturate this '■ Copperhead" falsehood with a considera ble solution of truth', and it will not re quire a very great exercise of metaphysi cal ingenuity on tho part of your loyal readers to detect that the sunlight of truth has developed, printed and made indeli ble a positive fact. The original photo graphs from which tho two faithful engra vings in Harper's Weekly were copied I brought from Louisiana last June, and 1 can therefore vouch for their entire racy, as well for the truthfullness of the brief account of the outrages perpetrated upon the unoffending negroes which was published in connection with the pictures. On the of lust March, four ne groes. the property of ('apt. John Lyon and Louis Fabyan of Clinton, La., start ed off at midnight in search of freedom, which they well knew would be guaran teed them as soon as they reached our lines at Baton Rouge, La. Their depar ture was quietly effected, and during the night they traveled at a rapid rate, not daring to venture out of their hiding-pla ces durjng the day, for fear of being cap tured by the " hunters" or gangs of guer rillas that infested the "woods for miles, and surrounded the swamps. The second day, one of the party, - John," ventured out in search of food. He had not been gone more than half an hour when the loud report of firearms startled and terri bly alarmed his companions] Believing that poor ''John" had fallen into the hands of the "hunters" or guerrillas, they kept secluded all that day. The fears of these oppressed creatures, as they hid in the de cayed trunks of old trees, surrounded on all sides by swamps and turbid bayous, the delectable abode of the most poison ous snakes, venomous reptiles, and the scaly alligator, can be imagined, but not described. Night fame, and the timid party set out on, their perilous journey, hoping to reach our lines next day. Passing thro' a sugar plantation, they stopped at one of ; the negro huts (described as neat, com i fortable cottages, by the Pro-Slavery wri i ters), where they were furnished with | (juite a liberal quantity of such wretched ftx* as the slaves receive from their hu mane; generous, and chivalrous masters. It was hero that the dreadful tale was told of the murder of poor " John." He had been shot by one of the brave and chival rous hunters. Jim Fassel, a notorious vil lain—the fear of every colored person for miles around. This same mnrderer, the day bofore, had assisted in the butchery of the young mulatto slave of 21 years, an intelligent '• field hand," who had escaped from a cruel master at Vicksburg, Miss. It seems that this young man had been concerned in a sort of conspiracy aiding and advising the flight of able-bodied men to our lines for the purpose of eulistiug in our army. Hearing that, his master sus pected him, he resolved to decamp, and success seemed to crown his efforts for i freedom until the sixth dcy, when a large j reward being offered by the Rebel planters) for his capture, or murder, a band of'huntH ers' with apaek of panting hounds thirst-, ing for blood, set out ou full chase for the I fugi:ive. At Cypress Bayou, about ten or I twelve mile# from Raton Rouge, he wa« ' i overtaki n in a Hiim.'l swamp, baving eluded | the track of his eniVgcd aud hoarderspuf i sue'rs for six dij*. Most of the time he was obliged togo without food, not daring !to show himself even to the slaves. Com i pletely exhausted, with his coarse gar ments hanging iu shreds, he sought ref uge in the branchesof a large but the bloodhounds sented his traek—until one of them, howling at the footof the tree,at tracted the attention of the 'man hunters.' Their discovery was signalled by the ut terance of the most horrible oaths,' shout ing for the unfortunate man to come down • out of the tree. He was in the act of do ing so, but begged most piteously for the inhuman wretches to call off their savage bounds, who flocked around the tree anx | ious to satisfy their bloody appetite. His I request was answered by another oath.fol j lowed by the whistling of a bullet, which | lodged '.n bis thigh, bringing him to the ground, where he was set upon by the ; bounds, and his face terribly lacerated.— I His captors desired to return with him alive to the planters in the vicinity of Vicksburg, who had so generously offered a large reward for bis capture—and it was this circumstance alone saved him from being entirely torn to pieces by the blood hounds. With exultant shouts and fearful itn i precations upon their lips, they placed the I half-lifeless and bleeding body upon a j horse, and, supported by one of the' hun ters." the brutal party started on their way i back with their victim. After riding a j few miles, tlicy alighted at the house of a | "bushwhacktVr' - Here they remained an i hour or two, imbibing freely of that gun j powder stimulant known as •• Lousinna whiskey." Excited almost to frenzy,they j galloped some four or five miles; till they | reached a small bayou, whore they halted jto water their horses. The wrath of Hea ; von had manifested itself during that | death-gallop, aud a righteous God inter posed, and with Ilis silent and mysterious | power lie summoned the agonized soul to j the bar of judgment, snatching it from the j clutches of those demon- while thoy were . gloating over the fiendish tortures iu store | for their innocent and helpless victim.— While in the act of adjusting a portion of his harness, the "hunter" holding the bleeding captive discovered that the vital spark had fled. They were greatly enrag ed to think that they were obliged to car ry an inaniu.a e piece of flesh. The body j was carried in this way to Jackson, where its arrival was welcomed by a brutal crowd, | who complimented the ' hunters" upon j their success, and heaped the vilest anath emas up in the remains, that, bleeding, torn, and disfigured, lay before them.— i One of the planters, who had lost several ! negroes since the Emancipation Proclama | tion, called all his slaves together, and compelled them to witness the burial of the murdered man in a ditch adjoininghis plantation. 'Toon PETER" is the name of the negro whose lacerated back, as presented in the original; photo graph, has excited both the sympathy and indignation of every humanitarian that has seen it. Here is his own statement, taken from his lips April 2,1863, at Baton Rouge, La. just after he had entered the Provost- Marshal's office. It may be well to state i that''Peter" could speak but, little Kng i lish, and that in broken accents. The majority of the negroes of Lousiaria are owned by Frenchmen or those of French descent, and nearly all speak French ; ih deed. thousands were to be found along our line of march who could not under stand a word of English. 15eing interrogated in French, ''Poor ] Peter," who stood before us the picture of poverty, shrouded in ragsof every imagin able color, began his doleful story. 'Ten days from to-day I left the plantation, run away from massa.' 'What made you run away, Peter; was your master ugly—did be whip you ?' With a peculiar shrug of his shoulders, and raising his eyes towards the ceiling he shouted, 'Lor Gor Almighty Massa! look here'—and suiting the action to the word, he pulled down the pile of dirty rags that bait' concealed his back, and which was once a shirt, and exhibit ed bis mutilated sable form to the crowd of officers and others present in the office, j It sent a thrill of horror to every white | person present, but the few Blacks who ! were waiting for passes, both men, w omen i and children, paid but little attention to | the sad spectacle, such terrible scenes be ing painfully familiar to them all. 'Who J whipped you, Peter V 'Overseer Artayon ; Carrier whipped me—l don't remember | the whipping. I was two months in bed. j sore from the whipping arid salt brine, which Overseer put oi my back. By and by my senses began to come—they said 1 was sort of crazy, and tried to shoot every body. I did not know it—l did not know that I had attempted to shoot any one— they told me so. I burned up all my clothes, but I don't remember that. I nev er was this way (crazy) before. I don't know what make me coinc that way (crazy). ; My master came after I was whipped—-aw me in bed. He discharged the overseer They told mc I attempted to shoot mv wife j first one. I did not shoot any one. I did not harm anyone. My wife tcllmc I nodo : these things when I come away. Shetho't i t was dead with whipping. My master's name is Captain John Lyon, cotton plant- ! cr, on Atchafalaya River, near Washing ton, La. I was whipped two months before Christmas.' The above is a verbatim copy of the original statement of 'Poor Peter', as writ ten up in the bank of the photograph at Baton Rouge. La., a few hours afteritwas printed. If 'Copperheads' still doubt the authenticity of cither the pictures or the j narrative, tiic originals of both are open . fir free inspection aod criticism. '-Poor Peter.'' with "Gordon," tho sable youth clad in variegated and torn garments, and whose likeness also appeared at the same time in Harpers Weekly, together with another negro, reached our lines at Baton Rouge, La., in safety, after enduring un told hardships. They were in feeble con dition, hunger havinggreatly reduced them and exhausted their energies. Although half famished, and tlieirswol lcn feet bleeding at every pore, they could not refrain froui weeping with joy when their colored brethern surrounded them, clothed in the Federal uniform, and offer ed them plenty of food and warm oloth- All of these men were chased by 'hunt ers' with their savage pack of hounds, but they -were ingenious enough to wade and swim through every stream they could find on their way, twice swimming' the turbid waters of the Amite River in their wan derings. Upon coming from the water, they had presence.of mind and sagacity enough to rub every portion of their body with onions and strong-scented weeds, irt order to elude the trail ofthe bloodhounds, who were several times close upon tlu'ln. To their intelligence may be attributed their narrow and fortunate escape from tho terrible fate that befell - Poor John,' their companion. This concludes my narrative of the two pictures, libeled by the Pro- Slavery press as ''the fruitful results of a fanatical Abolitionist's deluded imagina tion." New York, Nov. 12, 1868.
