Tho pin-t year, undoi' a wiso Prov'.doneo, has been one of the gen oral pronperity to the. nation. Il has, however been attended with moro than ukuuI chanlinonionts, as in I ho loss of life and property by Htorm and fire. While these disas ter have served to call tortli mo best elements of human nature in our countrv, and to develop a friend ship Tor us on tho part of foreign natiotm, which goes fur townrd al levlutinfr tho distresses occasioned by thcM calamities, the benevolent, who huvo so generously shared thoir mean with tho victims of thoRO misfortunes, will reap their reward in the consciousness of hav ing performed a hoblo act. nnd in receiving tne gratefu! thanks of mon, women and children; whoso sufferings they havo relieved. rottEtOX

TIiih ennrxn hns received tho com mendation of tho German Govern ment, und has wounded no suscep tibiliiy of the French. The Govern ment of tho Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendly feeling towards tho United States, and a desire to lutrmonizo wmi uie mod -rate and just policy which this Government maintains Iti its relations with Asiatic nowors, as well as with South Am-.-rican re publics. I havo given assurances that the friendly feelings of that Government aro fully shared by tho United Stales. The ratification of the Consulnr nnd Naturalization Conventions with iho Austro-llnn- gariaiiEmpiro na . e oeen exchanged. 1 havo been officially informed of tho annexation of tho Stuto of tho Church to tho Kingdom of Italy and the removal of the cipitul of that Kingdom to Roino.

JAI'A.t. Willi Jnpnn we continue to main tain iiilimale relations. The Cab inet of tho Mikado has, sirico the close of Iho lust session of Congress, selected cilijseiia of the Uliiled Slates to servo in ofllees of impor tance in several department of Ihe Government. I huvo reason to think thai this selection is duo lo an appreciation of tho disinterested ness of tho policy which tho United Slates havo pursued towards Japan. It is our desire to continue to main lain this disinto.ebtcd and just poll, cy with Chilians well us Japan. Tho correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no dis position on tho part of this Govern ment to swerve from its established course. TUB roKKAN EXl'llilTION. Prompted by n desire to put an end to tho barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked sailors on Iho Cor oil n coast, I instructed our Minister at lVkin to endeavor to conclude a convention with Corea, for securing till) safely and humttne treatment of biich mariners. Admiral Rogers was instructed to occompony him with il suillcient foreo to protect him in case ol'tieed. A small surveying pa rty son t ou t, on reach i ng the coast, Was treacherously attacked utn dis advantage. Ample opportunity was given Cor explanation and nppology for tho insult, neither ciuno. force was then landed after an ar duous march over n rugged nnd difficult country, the forts from which tho outrages had boen com mitted woro reduced by a gallant insault, and were destroyed. Hav ing thus punisliod'the criminals and having vindicated tho honor of Iho flag, tho expedition returned, find ing it impracticable, undor the cir cumstances, to cotielu Jo tho desired convention. I respectfully rtfer to tho correspondence relating thereto, herewith submitted, and leuvo the subject for such action as Congress may eeo fit to tnko. Mexico. Tho Republic of Mexico has not j et repealed tho very objectionable laws establishing what is known as the free Zono on tho frontier of tho United Slates. It is hoped thut this may yot be dono, and also that moro stringent measures may bo ta ken by the Republic for restrain ing lawless persons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by its own.ao lion, will soon roliovo this govern ment of tho difficulties experioncod from theso causes. Our relations with tho various Republics of Cen tral und South America eoniinuo, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly. I recommend some action by Congress in regard to overdue installments under tho award of tho Venezuela claims com mission of 1 SOU. Tho internal dis sensions cf this government present co justification for absence of effort, lo meet their solemn treaty obliga tions. The ratification of an extra dition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged. It is a subject of Congratulation thut tho great Empire of Bruiil hns taken tho ini tiulory steps toward tho ablition of slavery. Our relations with the Empire were always cordial and will naturally be made moro so by this act It 'is not too much to hope that the government of Brazil may hereafter find that it for its into -est aa well as intrinsically right, to advance toward cntiro cmuncipu lion moro rapidly than the present act comteinplatc. The tone, pros perity and greatness of a nation ia to be found in Ihe elovation and cd ! o cation of ita laborers. It is a sub ! ject P-r regret that the rcformore in mi direction, which were roluntar I ily promised by the aUtesmon of Spain have not been carried ont in ! lie West India Colonic.
