CONGRESSIONAL Opening of Sixtieth Congress. The first day of the Sixtieth con gress was taken up largely with the routine business of its organization. r-ue senate was In session only half an "our and did nothing but swear in new members and call the roll. There was a slight clash of opinions as to the or- der of these two matters, Senator Lodge objecting to the course of Vice rrcsident Fairbanks In having the sen ators sworn before the roll call and Baying It was contrary to custom.' The vice president insisted, however, that this had been the practice of the sen ate for more than a hundred years. The new Oklahoma senators, Owen and Gore, were not recognized, and their credentials will not be accepted untn af ter their formal election by the Johnston of Alabama could be sworn until the deaths of their predecessors, Morgan and Fettus, had been announc ed, as the senate adjourned in honor of the dead. In the house the only variation from the cut and dried routine outlined by the leaders of the majority was the nrn(,f ni k rw,. wicnnndn "" J ' against we ruies or me lasi congress Speaker Cannon had been duly elected in accordance with the unanimous choice of the Republican caucus on the preceding Saturday night and had been Mrortf.d to the rhnlr hv Williams the escorieu to me cnair Dy v imams, me Democratic leader, when the adoption of the former rules was moved. Mr. Cooper said that experience had con vinced him that the rules gave too much power to the speaker and too lit tie opportunity for the members to rep resent their constituents. For Instance, when he had refused to vote for the f'aciflc railroads refunding bill a former speaker had refused to recognize h 1 m for any purpose for the next four or five years. He declared further that the speaker had become the sole ' judge of what legislation shall be consid ered, whereas, in his opinion, the leadership of the party should be upon the floor of the house and not in the chair.

A recommendation is also made for representation at the Tokyo exposition In 1012. Chairman Fowler Reapp6inted.

Thirty-eight of the forty-three de fendants named by the government in its charge of conspiracy and trade restraint on the part of the powder trust have filed answers in the federal court at Wilmington, all denying the charges.
