The author I* a trained journalist, aivi in the Interest cf the London "Standard" accompanied the Prince an<l Princess of Wales on their re oont tour. •■..-. however, a per functory chronicle of royal doings or m|sdoings —indeed, It has very little to say of those ex alted personages— but a?sociation with their party gave the writer _..... r.or. open to the ordinary traveller and enabled him to meet j>eople from wbora he derived novel, varied ar.d Illuminating views on tlie questions <^f the day. These questions are numerous, :n t-i.nent and grave. The atmosphere of the Orient is heavy with discussion, and Mr. Low has the art of touching on vital topics lightly and briphtly. First of all there is the jrreat j>fob!em of race. Ir.dia, of course. i< a sub ject country, and Its inhabitants are continually reminded, cr fancy they are reminded, of their inferiority. Then there is the potent fact of co-or. Consciously or unconsciously, generally the former, the line is drawn between natives ar.d Europeans. Anglo-India, says Mr. Low. tern not care to be too familiar with the in habitants of the country- He discerns ■ cer tain acerbity in the sentiments ot many Uiflu- psrtlal Indians toward the English and English rule. He dines with a number of native dig nitaries of Wealth and standing. and finds when they are property warmed up by French cook fry and judicious contradiction that one and all are su*Tering tinder a sense of Injustice and list, A great Parsee mil] owner can't under staad why his white foremen should be admit ted at the railway station to apartments from •nfaich he. the employer, is excluded In common with coolies tad day laborers. Th Parsee mill ionaire who may ask half of London to his en tertainments when he Is living In Piccadilly wsjbM be requested to withdraw at once if be pot a foot inside the grounds of the Bombay Yacht Club. The grievance is rather social than political or legal, and hence all the harder to cope with, though ncr.e the less real. Th»> witter treats such a subject with abundance of amusing illustration, and even has the hardi hood to intimate that the young British officer is often wanting hi tact and consideration in his dealings with natives. The fascinating subject of widows affor.ls th« asiOssr a rich field for the display of Interesting fact and sound reflection. .According to a re cent census, there are some twenty million Hindu widows, of whom more than three hun dred and twenty thousand are under fifteen years of ege. The government, which has tried to put p prop to female Infanticide and has abolished pelf-imraolat:on by widows, has been unable to prevent child marriages, with all their attendant pasJm, A feeble and Utopian effort to raise the age of marriage to twelve has met with no re rponse. Even the much heralded abolition of suttee may be a doubtful blessing, since multi tudes of women only exchange the swift and passing agony of the funeral pyre for years of oppression, neglect and misery. Many thou rands of widows have to choose between a lire of degradation and shame If they leave their • husband's relatives and barbarous 111 usage If they remain with them. Of the Intricate and absorbing system of caste the author suites infortnlngiy and enter- j tainingly. The classification of society in India I is guarded by the strictest observance of the j principle of heredity and includes most of the population, v.ho are shut up, as it were, in air tight compartments rigidly marked off from the i rest. Religion with what seems a malign in- ; genuity his succeeded in heaping complication round the two essential functions of eating- and marrying. As tor the higher sort of Brahman, I nothing Is easier than to sully his purity. There i ■yaj some inferior castes In the south, who are sot supposed to approach even within speaking distance of the elect. A regular table has been drawn up of what may be called the degrees of j pollution; so that, while some of these low per sons can pollute a man of a superior caste only by touching him, it is held that blacksmiths, masons, carpenters and leather workers can pollute at a distance of twenty-four feet, toddy drawers at thirty-six Feet and cultivators at forty-eight feet, while the pariahs who eat beef j have a . stiasi range of no leas than twenty- j one yards twelve inches. Luckily, these ] Injunctions are subject to certain convenient ! legal fictions. Sweetmeats, it appears, are not ] food and soda water the pundits at Benares have decided is not water within the meaning sf the act so to speak. As to the prohibited de prees of consanguinity -in marriage a table of them would include nearly everybody except cousins several times removed. A commentator imagines as an analogy a great tribe of Smiths whs could only be united to fellow-Smiths and V/y no possibility to Browns, Joneses or Robin- ' sons. Then the Smiths would be split up into smaller fiercely endopamous clans, shooting Smiths and hunting Smiths, temperance Smiths Bad brewing Smiths, all forced to be accommo dated with life partners In their own particular section of the Smithian multitude. And having played about the subject with much twinkling i tayety he sums it up soberly: I T'-ut tlie crudities and cruelties of the caste sys tem :j»-«f<l not blind us to its other aspects. Titan is no dvuM tliat it la the main cause <■: the lunda :n*-r.t2.1 stability and contentment by which ludian iwfcfcty has been braced for centuries against th. shocks of politics and the eatucl> sms of nature. It provides . .cry man with his place, lii- career, bis , '•r-capation. his circle of friend 3. It makes him. at ; Urn outset, a mcinbtr of a corporate body; it pro- : "•■cts hini throueh life from tho canker of social .^alousy and unfulfilled aspirations; it insures him « orapanionship and a sense of community with «'th«?rs in like case with himself. The caste organ ization is to the Hindu his club, his trade tinion, v .:- beaent society, his philanthropic society. There *»r<j no workhoi:ses in Ir.'lia. and none are — as yet— T)eed<?J. The obligation to provide for kinsfolk and Meads in distress is universaliy acknowledged; r.or can it be questioned that this la due to that recognition of the strength of family tics, and of ■be bonds create by association and common pur suits, which is fostered by the caste principle An India without caste, as tilings stand at present, it Is at Quite easy 10 imagine. More ephemera! in character than Mr. Low's I ass are the newspaper letters and magazine sketches embraced in lan Malcolm's -Indian Pictures and Problems." This writer wandered far in Northern India, and the latter half of his Volume is devoted to Burmah. whither the au thor accompanied the viceroy on a state- pil grimage. This book is mere objective than the preceding, more a diary of personal experience. more a description of places visited and per sons met. These are the letters home of a sjm pathetic, appreciative traveller, who has a knack of making unfamiliar scenes and faces seem real to us, who has more than the usual opportunities of teeing beneath the surface and who occasionally bursts Into song when level Xiiws Is inadequate to express his exuberant I feelings. He visits rajahs and maharaj-ihs and depicts the splendors of an Oriental court with lively appreciation, and then turns to pay tribute to the efficiency and self-sacrifice of the English administrators, who cope with famine and drouth and enduring heat and strange tonguea and superstitions and lack of gratitude. This book. like the other, is illustrated by many v.-ell ■...-. product? of the kodak, the pictures ♦•/ native ru'.ersjn their tugg«ry 1 ins particu- ' - «a,-!y BtrLkiri*. '[' £t!!l another Journalist afield is the -well known Anglo-Indian Mr. Everard Cotes, who records impressions of places more or less inti mately connected with the great conflict be tnecn Russia and Japan and discusses the re sults of the war so far as they may affect the interests and destinies of the British empire. I This Is a sober • me, worthily treated by a | capable and interesting writer. No intelligent I person Fuppo.-^s for one instant that a war af fects only the combatants. The civilized world is l*ie audience, and the side Issues, the effect on tlio spectators, the reflex action of events arc scarcely ley? Important thnn the rate of the I belligerents themselves. Hundreds of millions I nf Asiatics hold their heads higher and draw a | longer breath because an Oriental nation has • downed a European power. When the babus of Bengal are boycotting British goods and the agitators of the Punjab are denouncing their "oppressors" even the broken spirited peons of Java may be dreaming of independence. And what of China, with population and potential wealth nice times those of Japan? la China really awakening or will It only turn over and j slumber on? "Will the array of yellow against white intensify and sweep the East like the I plague? And what about Japan — she hold I her pace? How far can she go? And there is ! India, with its army, its trained consular and civil service, its accumulated fund of govern mental experience, Its preparedness for etner • jrencies and the immeasurable advantage of Its 1 propinquity — what part is India to play In the j furtherance or hindrance of the game In the i Far East? An answer to questions like these is ! Bought In a season's flight through Manchuria and Corea and Japan and. the region that sep arates them from Hindustan. The author is duly impressed with the fact I that Chinese are successful under British rale. I In Singapore and the Malay Peninsula, in Bur mah, too, and other places, a large share of business is in Chinese hands. Chmese labor la efficient and contented, and Mongolians make good citizens and loyal subjects. This does not prevent tho Chinese at home from cherishing animosities against Britons along with Ameri cana and Japanese, their preservers,' hardly less strong than against those peoples who have been openly working for the dismemberment of the great empire. But careful comparison of views, particularly of resident missionaries, leads to the conclusion that such hostility Is not increasing, and that a healthy respect for for eigners v..is a marked result of the Boxer trouble. The missionaries as a class command : respect; many are good Chinese scholars, and I live on terms of more or less intimate famil i iarity with the natives, and for the purposes of ; the inquirer they are a more reliable source of : information than the. commercial classes. But it need not be supposed that diminished hostility ; is to be replaced by Instant affection for the ] foreigners. i I ♦"•hina has taken in her stow wmy the advice con- I tinually proffered l.er from the West, to employ 1 foreigners to furnish her with armament ana to < .'.rill lier soldiers. She has pot together a great '■ <ieal of more or less modern material of war, and ' a large force of men not altogether despicable from !;i righting lint of view, in spite cf the essentially ' peaceful character of her people. With Russia de ' feated by a nation thai China holds to be her own ! ;*!f>rior, and with France and Germany— the only i other rations likely to interfere with her autonomy ! —in effectual check, sh* is forming the inflated i opinions of her own position natural to the Eastern mind. She has not forgotten the catastrophe which befel her efforts in 1988 to expel the foreigner. She acquiesces in his presence, as an unavoidable evil, i and protects his person with solicitude that is sometimes pathetic in order to avoid subsequent trouble, but she has no respect or liking far him self. The Chinese administration Is a bundle of I contradictions. Officials still habitually employ torture In the ordinary dispensation of justice, though the people are the most law-abiding In ♦he world. The government is one of inaction exacerbated by tax gathering. The central government does not bother with the provinces —It only requires sufficient remittances and the assurance that the people are content. Towns are insanitary and devoid of elementary con veniences, but close beside some of the wnrS?t of Chinese towns are European managed for eign settlements with every modern improve ment which multitudes of Chinese prefer to the mismanaged native quarters. Progress is local, partial and slow, and is Impeded by the intense national loyalty to existing Institutions. But the inexhaustible fund of industrious and capa ble labor available for transportation to any field Is a force to be reckoned with by the world. Coming to Corea, the author avers that pa tience and self-restraint in dealing with a sub ject people have not been displayed by the Jap anese in tho peninsula. Everything tends to show the Japanese have made a false start. The blood of the Empress murdered by Japanese In stigation has never b**»n washed away. The Oorean Is strong bodied, pleasant mannered, good tempered. He is a coward only because experience warns him not to expect Justice from his rulers. The system of forced labor teaches him to idle lest he enrich the tax gatherer. Jap anese methods do not always commend them selves to the Western mind. It gives a shock to find officers disguised as cooties, photogra phers or domestics in order to acquire Informa tion or experience. The traders, artisans and laborers have a poor standard of commercial probity. Japan is a tourist's paradise, we are. told, because tho tourist la a source of profit to its people, but it Is no place for the European who has to make his living. Regulations will be interpreted to his disadvantage and he will find native competitors favored at every point. The Chinese merchant is content to work with and through the foreigner. The Japanese will do nothing of th* kind, but Is determined to get busi ness sooner or later into his own hands. The am bition of Japun is to drive «11 manufacturers but her own out of Japanese markets, and out of those Of China. Manchuria and Cores, to absorb the carrying trade and to employ none but Japanese in the handling and distributing of the goods. An ambition honorable and legitimate enough in itself arouses, however, the indignation of the foreigner who finds the state leagued with pri vate enterprise against him. The promises of the government to treat foreigners upon an in dustrial and commercial equality with Japanese in Manchuria and Corea leave much to be de sired In fulfilment, and it must be admitted that commercial dealing, even by the government, is not yet quite recognized as an expression of na tional honor. The writer traces the effort to take industrial Japan out of European leading strings and shows that efficiency Is limited by the paucity of men of first class training. Though Japanese have the advantage in China of similarity in language and habits, yet when it comes to Western knowledge, China Is begin ning to realize that it is more advantageous to learn first hand from the Europeans than sec ond hand from the Japanese. The Japanization of China Is proceeding, in consequence, very much more slowly than Is generally supposed. These generalizations are necessarily hasty and superficial, but they are indicative and provoke thought. The difficulties and dangers of the Far Eastern situation in a word concern only Japan and 1 China. Japan is powerful but poor. ; She has her hands full. She occupies an uneasy pre-eminence, but she does not supply the nerves and brains to China. The flowery em pire is borrowing largely from Europe, and mod ern Chinese civilization and progress have ail the inherent weaknesses of erotics. Japan will remain Great Britain's ally and China will re main China. The interests and the peace of the civilized world demand the discouragement of Chinese armament, but how. the reader may s iv. can Western nations preach to China a doctrine they arc utiablo or unwilling to practise themselves^ .. t - . ■ - • -...'- -— -' 

NEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE, THURSDAY. DECEMBER 5. 1907. ME3IORYOFTHACKEBAY IS ENGL. i XD AND AMERICA Speech Before Titmarsh Club, Lon don, hi 1 the American Ambassador. Justin McCarthy, the veteran Irish statesman, successor to Parn*-ll in th« leadership of the Home Kule party In tbe House of Commons and author of "A History of Onr Own Times," wrote as fol lows a. few week: ago in an illustrated article la "Th< New York Independent*': Many •■" my American readers must already know something of the Titmarsh Club, a. literary anil social Institution founded not long since in London with the object ••: paving periodical hotn !igi j to the memory or' W. M. Thackeray. The club Included in its members a large number of lit erary men whose names are well known througb out the reading world. Among such names are those of Sir F. C. Hurnand, J. M. Barrie. Comyna Carr, Frederick Harrison. Anthony Hooe, Sir Gil bert Parker. Owen Seaman, th« well known mem ber of -I-.- staff of "Punch"; Percy White. Beer bohm Tree, Harry Irving and Theodore lfcKenna. The third dinner of the club is to take place on Thursday, October .*, when the chair is to be taken by Mr. Whitelaw Held, the United States Ambassador, who is one of the club's original mem ,l may perhaps be excused If I indulge a little personal and family vanity by mentioning the fact that my son and I were also among the original members of the club. It seems to be es pecially appropriate that the United Stales Am bassador should preside at the forthcoming ban qiK't. The genius of Thackeray has never been more thoroughly appreciated than it was through out the United; States, and 1 have myself heard the great author allude in terms of i *•*- highest gratification to the welcome which his lectures received throughout the great cities, of the Ameri ran Republic Mr. White! aw Reid is, I reed hardly tell American readers, a brilliant speaker, who upon such an occasion Is not at all likely to dis appoint, and I am sure that his address delivered at it. opening: of the Tl.-.narsh Club banquet will find its echoes ringirs through the '.■■■■:',< of all. educated men and women In these islands. The letters and circulars Issued officially by the club all bear In imprint an effigy portrait of Thackeray, ami I inclose one of tnese. with a bope that it may be reproduced In the pages of -The Indep mdent. fc The masa ol thick hair on Thackeray's bead, which is well represented in thla sketch, bad grown snowy v: Ue long before his too short living career had cotne to Its end. London, England. The epeech thus generously heralded by so con spicuous a man of letters Is here reproduced from this week's "Independent." Thackeray found his audience in America al most if not quite as soon as at home; he always held it. and holds It still. And, perhaps, too. it may be remembered that Mr. Thackeray seemed to like as nearly as well as we liked him. and was never weary of showing his good will — even when be was somewhat more lonely In such manifestations than he would be now. i never had the good fortune to meet Mr. Thackeray in America, though I did meet soon afterward your other great novelist of that period. But tor years I was- constantly hearing gossip about Thackeray from those who had met him during his visit to us, like the genial publisher who was his guide, philosopher and friend among the Brahmins of Boston, or like the old Centurions of New York. Their ac counts ran ail one way. They admired his talk and they loved him. They pictured him as big, hearty and very human. They didn't and him playing the lion the. least little bit. and we may hope he didn't find us playing the spread eagle too much. They "pointed out the corner in the Century where he need to sit exchanging literary chat, or. in Yankee parlance, "swapping stories'." with a group of clubmen about him. They could tell you years afterward what had been Thackeray's favorite chair, and some had even been so observant of the least trifle* about the great man that they knew what particular con coction In a club tumbler had been his favorite "nightcap." There never was any lack of admiration for the other great novelist to whoa I have re ferred, even when we were still thin skinned ami the "American Notes" and "Martin Chuz zlewit" were still fresh from the press. But there was no such social and dub tradition of Dickens. Perhaps the reason Is not very ob scure. Dickens Inted us. [or the very eyes in all the world wherein we were then most anxious to look ••'!. In the books I have just named. Thackeray represented America to the mother country in the persons of Henry Es mond and George "Washington. NTo doubt we had our Jefferson Bricks and Elijah Pograms. too. i do not deny It, and do not deny that they were painted to the life. But we were human enough to like it better when the others were presented as our national types. No such consideration, however, affected the publisher's touchstone— and, I am afraid, the touchstone of most men of letters, too — sales. These went on In America very much as they did In Great Britain — perhaps more so. The great popular circulation belonged to Dick ens, the audience fit though fewer to Thack eray. I have not s< en the late figures— perhaps some publisher here will correct me if I am wrong — but I fancy that the disparity in sales is leas nowadays. Fen reasonably comprehen sive private libraries are without the works of one if not both; but I believe that In the severer collections of pure literature the name under which we are assembled begins to lead. We must not think of anything more nearly approaching comparison between trust- two men of genius. It would be utterly Idle if not Impossible. I may say, however, without dis paragement or offence, that American men of letters are apt to speak with particularly warm admiration of Thackeray. Simply as a story teller they may not rate him so high as other British authors— not, in fact, so high as some British authors of to-day. They may even hint at prolixity, and at the frequency with which the Innocent reader la held by the buttonhole for overmuch moralizing. But criticism Is silenced, all are carried away by his creations of charac ter, by the keen hut kindly analysis of human nature, the scorn of meanness, the trenchant sat ire that .still hates to wound, the sentiment at once healthy, manly and tender, the splendid humanity. As for his style, it is thought wellnigh perfect. Leslie Stephen has somewhere told us that at the beginning, if not to the end. this stylo waa the work of constant revision and In terlineation. For myself 1 do not believe any style of the first order was ever attained In any other way. I have no faith— here perhaps speaks the old editor, hardened in his preju rlioesbut I have no sort of faith in the things that are written at a dash, and handed you without a change of a word. It was no less a genius than Sheridan, was it not, who formu lated the Immutable literary law that "Your easy writing's rurst hard reading." But this rambling talk must not wander on. As I was thinking before dinner of this man. whose place Is secure among the Immortals, whom every one counts in the first rank of th« great Victorians, I could not help recalling that exquisite little essay of his among the "Round about Papers," \il A 'V Bonum, as noble a paper as ever adorned even "The Spectator." You remember the warm tribute it pays to two men of letters then lately taken away, one from you. both perhaps I may presume to say. from us. IMiomas Babington Macaulay and Washing ton Irving. He called them the Johnson and Goldsmith of their time, and finally applied to them some words which I venture to think this company of men of letters will think we may apply with equal justice and even greater fervor to "William Makepeace Thackeray himself. Let me close by rending them: "It has been his fortunate lot to give Incal culable happiness and delight to the world, which thanks him In return with an immense kindliness, respect, affection. It may not be our chance, brother scribe, to be endowed with such merit, or rewarded with such fame. Rut the rewards of these men are rewards paid to 'our service. "We may not win the baton or epau lettes; but "God give up strength to guard the honor of the flag!" 1 * -

' Commenting on the recommendation of President Roosevelt in his message that there should be es tablished in Washington a national gallery of art, S. B. P. Trowbridge, the New York architect, who has been active in the movement, said yesterday: Friends of this movement all over the country will be gratineU that the President has again shown his loresigtit and staiesiuanaaip in rising above tne turmou of recent nna.ncia.l troubles to recommend to Congress the establishment of a national gallery. Tola action of the President will unquestionably give a strong impetus to we move ment. It is »igni:.cant that this is practically the only definite' recommendation by the Chief Execu tive in regard to the tine arts since the time of Washington and Jefferson. If the President's rec ommendation is followed. Congress will ue asite-i to make an appropi iati<tn for the erection of a suitable and appropriate building for a national gaiicry. The action of the board of regents of the Smith sonian Institution yesterday In urging Congress to make an appropriation for adapting the large hall of the Smithsonian Building to the purposes •■{ a national gallery of art only emphasizes the neces sity of a proper building for housing valuable col lections. Such an arrangement, however, can be only temporary, as the, large hall of the Smith si nlan Building Is badly lighted and otherwise un suitable. Congress will be asked to act soon. Many Senators have taken a keen interest In the movement. The President's expression in regard to the abo lition of the tariff on works of art gives fresh en couragement to the artists who have been work ing for years to this end. The President truly says there should be no obstacles to the Importation of works of art. It Is a manifest absurdity that we as a nation should raise obstacles to their Im portation. At present, works of art are looked upon as luxuries, and to a great extent are kept in private galleries to which the public are refused access. Every step toward placing them within the reach of the people Is I step in advance. The Smithsonian Institution, on its establishment by Congress, in 1846, was made the lawful custodian of all works of art belonging to the nation, and the regents sought to maintain a rallery. Few-pur chases, however, were made for It lor many years. Mrs. Harriet Lane Johjjstoa. ignorant qX the ex- Istence of a national Kallery. bequeathed her col lection of paintings to the Corcoran Art Gallery, which was obliged to decline the bequest. President Roosevelt In his message to Congress in December, 1904. recommended that the Smith sonian Institution should be authorized to accept any additions to Its collections, and In 19w> a de cree of the SUDreme Court of the District of Co lumbia authorized the Smithsonian Institution to receive the gift of the Johnston collection and gave legal standing to a national gallery.
