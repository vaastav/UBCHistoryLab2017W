Dr. Smucker promulgated these "ten commandments" in a sermon last night in "Peris and Rules of Con duct for Mothers," tho first sermon of a series of "one-man debates.' The series of laws, modeled upon the decalogue, is as follows: 1. Thou shalt have no man except thy husband. 2. Thou shalt place no club, so cial circle, pleasure organization or missionary society before thy home. 3. Thou shalt not waste thy hus band's substance on gay raiment and vain show. Thou shalt not let the petty vexations of the household disrupt the family harmony and harass thy tired husband. 5. Thou shalt not teed thy family with Idle gossip and neighborhood scandal. 6. Thou shalt not fret thyself be cause tny neighbor's house is greater than thine, neither shalt thou repine when Bhe smiles condescendingly from her limousine to thee in a trolley car. 7. Thou shalt not serve punch to thy guests nor put up prizes at thy whist parties, lest thy moral advice to thy sons and daughters become a mockery. 8. Thou shalt not pronounce thyself delighted to see an unwelcome caller, neither shalt thou declare to the con ductor that thy 13-year-old child is of half-fare age, lest thy heart be come hollow and thy soul utterly false. 9. Thou shalt not wear showy dresses over shoddy underwear, nor shine with imitation jewelry, lest thy children be given to sham and false pretense. 10. Thou shalt not allow thy Bible to gather dust and thy attendance upon divine worship to be governed by caprice or the state of the weath er, lest the altar fires of thy heart go out and thy children become god less. LYING ABOUT THE COLONEL. He Never Contemplated Heading a Paltry 12,000 Troops. The London Dally Mail is a liar and a crook and a jackass and a burglar. The Colonel never planned to raise a force of 12,000 Rough Riders to throw into Flanders in case the Unit ed States went to war with Germany. Twelve thousand men, indeed. Is the Colonel a mollycoddle or a milksop that he should command a paltry cor poral's guard? And if he planned to raise such a force, would he be de terred by the fact that the United States did not go to war? The Iiondon Daily Mall would bet ter confine its vituperation of great soldiers to Kitchener. If the Colonel prepared to go to war it would be with a force of at least 12,000,000 men. His social relations with the kaiser make it beneath his dignity to command fewer men than the Ger man emperor. Moreover, if he had planned to raise an army and rough ride the trenches Of Flanders, the failure of the United States govern roent to declare war upon Germany could not have held him back. He •would have commandeered the neces sary transports, moved his legions to CalaiB and taken command of all the forces along thp western front. The Colonel is a man of action. He is no closta philosopher %ho scribbles armies on paper. The fact that he has rittver taken -charge ot the war Is proof that he never thought of going to war. Possibly the London Dally Mail'liaa confused him with some of the Balk&n states.—Nelfr York "World. as- Intelligent, Skids: ^^Does yon* titke telligent Interest Uj£r t&fe -war?"

ALLOWING is the message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and tiuuse al the beginning of the Sixty-fourth congress: CJenllciueii of the Congress—Since I Inst had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war of natioiiH on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun to disclose Its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within Its flame' some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered the whole face of International affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. The president tells how this eountry practiced neutrality and declares that he hopes that when the time cornea for readjustment and' reoperation this country will be of Infinite service. Re ferring to Central and South American problems, the president declare* that we should retain unabated the spirit which has Inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly pat Into words by President Monroe. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are In her own bands. But we have at least proved that we win not take advan tage of her In her distress and under take to impose upon ber an order and government of oar own choosing. lib erty Is often a fierce and Intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set and to which no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bltl of rights, which in the great days- in which our government was set up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine is, "That government Is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple, nation or community that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness and safety and la most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, ai.J that, when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community hath an Indubitable, Inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to tbe public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but nec essary process. We will aid and be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her. and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control. 

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Economic Adjustments Inevitable With* in tho Next Generation. The moral is that tbe states of Amer ica arc not hostile rivals, but co-op*. eratlng friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of Interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them ft new significance as factors in interna* llonal affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them aa in a very deep and true sense a unit lit world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to gethet. quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all tbe cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hos tile rivalries united In spirit and pw pose, they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This is pan-Americanism. It has rnjne of the spirit of empire In it It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment* of the spirit of law and independent and liberty and mutual service. :V The president calls attention to the!, meeting in 'Washington recently of representatives of the pan-American^ reputes and says that economic ad*? !n&*&nt is Inevitable In tbe next gen.' pration. »yS, Sh v'0 No one who really ctfniprehonds th£ sptrlt of the great poop's for whom we| are appointed to speak can fall to per" celve that their passion is for. peace, their- ieulus best displayed In the prafcsf 'lee of the arts of peace.

SATURDAY NEWS. W A Pfaoto by American Preac Association. PRE8IOENT WILSON'S LATEST PICTURE. (From aoapabot takes on Nov. 26.) of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the un censored thought that quickens It Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning or agreeable to our princi ples. But Just because we demand un molested development and the undis turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, tbe aggression we ourselves will not practice. We Insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development We do more than that We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for Individual Uberty and free national development to the inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there Us people that tries to walk In these difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberly on this side the sea and have deemed it us Important that our nelgb bora should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be have set America aside as a whole for the uses of Independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation as of aggression from without We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary In times of peace as In times of war. 

SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. IIWdaM Standing Rtflular Foroo—Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldisrs. BUt war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It Is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and immediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it The military arm of their government which they will not allow to-direct them, they may properly use to serve tbein and make their independence secure, and not their own independence merely, but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role In the world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened am bition to play. It is with these ideals in mind that tbe plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before you. and which I urge you to sanction and put Into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinised and discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps and they Seem to me for the present sufficient They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 offi cers and 102.9S5 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7.186 officers and 134.707 enlisted men. or 141,843 all told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of Infantry, four regiments of field artillery and four aero squadrons, besides 750 Officers re quired for a great variety of estra -"service, especially the all important •dnty of tmlninK the dtfeen force of whlPh shall presently speaks 702 non "ommissioned officers for service In drill, racruitins and tbe like and the necessary ouofta fit epllsteJ men for the j\t«£rt£rTnnater the hospital orp«. the ordnance department and serrteejt These 

MESSAGE Declares That #$Full Navy Pro gram Is Carried Out We Wirt Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Bor ders. are the additions necessary to render the army adequate for its present du ties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, but also in the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isth mus and in Porto Rico. By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan alsa contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400.000 disciplined citi zens, raised in increments of 133,000 a year throughout a period of three years. This it is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would bo asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400,000 men would be pro vlded with personal accouterments as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assem bled for training at stated intervals at convenient places In association with suitable units of the regular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. The president says it is up to th« patriotic youncr men of the country to respond to this call. 

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR GREATER NAVY. Always Looked to It aa Our First and Chief Line of Defense. The program which will be laid be fore you by the secretary of the navy is similarly conceived.' It Involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be. carried out, but It does make definite and ex plicit a program which has heretofore been only Implicit held in the minds of the committees on naval affairs' and disclosed in the debates of the two houses, but nowhere formulated or for mally adopted. It seems, .to. me very clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the congress, to adopt a comprehensive plan for. putting the navy upon a final fqoting of strength and efficiency and to ,press that plan to completion within the next. five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense we have always seen it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high in deed .among the navies of the maritime nations. We Bhould now definitely de termine how we shall complete what W£ have begun and how soon. The program to be laid before you contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion Bhips, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It Is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for tbe construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gun boats and one hospital ship the second year two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat and one fuel oil ship the third year two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines and fifteen coast subma rines: the fourth year two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and the fifth year two battleships, one bat tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen' coaat submarines, one gunboat, one am munition ship and One repair ship. The secretary of the navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the personnel of the navy of 7,500 Sailors. 2,500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma rines. This increase would be suffi cient to care for the ships which are to be completed within the fiscal year 1917 and also for the number of men Which must be put In training to man the ships which will be completed early in 1918. It is also necessary that the number of midshipmen at the Na val academy at Annapolis should be Increased by at least 300 In order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added to. and authority is ask cd to appoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineer ing colleges, und for service In the avi ation corps a certain number of men taken frqpfc'&rtl life.

Of the vast wealth which the ironmaster possesed when he started giving away his fortune 20 years ago, in confor mity with his principle of dying poor, that is all he has left He now Is far down on the list of America's mil lionaires. Mr. Carnegie has given away about $330,000,000, If interest Were to be included on some of the funds he has set aside the total would reach nearly $400,000,000, The $20,000,000 which Mr. Carnegie has left he has given In his will al most entirely to charity.
