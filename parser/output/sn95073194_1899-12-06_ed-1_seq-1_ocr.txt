At a Con ference .of about twenty-five promi nent house republicans held at the capitol tonight it was decided that thd eligibility of Representative" Robert? of Utah to occupy a seat in the house should be investigated and determined and that pending the decision he should not be permitted to take the cath of office. This decision was arrived at by those present without a dissenting voice. Representative Tayler of Obid, who will have charge of the matter in the house, explained after the confer ence had adjourned that this proceed ing docs not involve a pre-judgment of the case, but irrespective of party, will afford the members an oppor tunity to vote after a thorough Inves tigation and complete presentation of the case for consideration. Mr. Tayler had made a study of the allegations and precedents and pre sented them at length to his col leagues. He offered a plan of proced- i ure which was agreed to after a gen ! cral exchange of views. The proced ure is to be as follows: When Mr. Roberts appears at the bar of the house to take the oath ob jection is to be made upon the ground that he is ineligible. He will then step aside and after the other mem bers are sworn in the member mak ing the objection who probably will be Mr. Tayler will recite the allega tions and offer a resolution for their investigation by a special committee. This will give the house an oppor tunity to vote in the first instance on the question of postponing the ad ministration of the oath until after the allegations have been investigated. The resolutions have not been for multed yet, but they will include the investigation cf the charge that Mr. Roberts' alleged conviction of viola tion of the Edmunds act in 1889 ren ders him inel.gible by the terms of that act. whether the fact that he is an avowed polygamist renders him in eligible and whether tne state of Utah in electing him has not violated the compact by which it obtained state hood.

The Post militaiy expert says: "Save for the list of .cas ualties there is still no news from Gen eral Metheun. He was among the wounded which may in a measure ac count for the prolonged uncertainty as to his 'present position. It is dif ficult to account for his description of fighting as desperate and hard, if the river divided the combatants. It is boped the wound which General Me suffered is not sufficiently important to deprive him of his command. "News from Mafeking brings our knowledge of the investment up to November 24, and despite a somewhat despondent telegram that supplied our latest previous information, we are convinced that Mafeking has in it still a good deal of fight The government has at last decided to mobolize the second division of the second army corps and it will doubtless be des patched as speedily as possible. We are living in a state of suppressed in terrogation. Every man has his little question to put at the proper time and at some one whom he desires to see pilloried. Before putting the question with which he is at present choking, let each man ask himself, when cavil ling at our unpreparedness, whether he would willingly pay the price of being prepared."

G METH SHOT r UTILE CHANGE IN HAYWAR1. I Past Tweaty-Foar loin Do Net Work Mack Chans. NEBRASKA CITY, Neb., Dec. 1. The condition of Senator Hayward this evening shows -little change from what it was twenty-four hours ago. He passed an uncomfortable night and has been very restless and uneasy today. Dr. Whitten spent most of the night at his bedside and has watched him close ly during the day. At 6 o'clock tonight he issued the following bullotin: "Senator Hayward has had a very restless day, having slept very little. His temperature is 100, pulse 89, regu lar and softer than in the morning;' respiration 24 and still intermitting. He is more conscious of his condition, as he manifested more concern about himself. Paralysis remains the same." The fact that the patient is more conscious of his condition is taken by Dr. Whitten as a good symptom,, in that it shows that his mind is brighter. .and more free, indicating partial ab sorption of the clot, and yet if he be comes greatly concerned and worried the effect is likely to be unfavorable. Major E. B. Hayward, the senator's brother, together with his wife, arriv ed from Davenport, la., at 9:30 this morning and has been at his brother's bedside almost the entire day. The scene in the sick room upon .he major's entrance was very affecting. Senator Hayward recognized his brother in stantly and apparently made a supreme effort to speak to him. Failing to utter a single intelligible word, he burst into tears and could not be quieted for some time. Mrs. Hayward was finally pre vailed upon to take a few hours' rest last night and as a consequence is feel ing much better physically today. How ever, her concern about her husband's condition is as great as ever. HIGH PRICE FOR RANGE STOCK. Stern Sold at Denver Brine the Highest . Price Since 1885. DENVER, Dec. 1.

Colorado, was sold by Clay, Robinson & Co. to the Colorado Packing company for 5.7o per 100 pounds. The steers averaged a weight of 1,552 pounds each and brought the owners IS9.25 each. They were bred from range cows and registered Hereford bulls, and were ''. and 4 years old. They were bred by Monte Blevens of North park, Colora do, and were the proper .y of his chil dren. The highest price recorded in this country this year on gras3-fed cattle was 5.50, paid in Chicago re cently. The price paid here would be equal to 6 per 100 pounds in Chi cago. This is the highest price paid for range cattle anywhere since 1882. The steers in question were fattened on the range and have never eaten any thing but hay and grass.
