This sentence forms a not unimportant part of the message of President Woodrow Wilson to the Con gress. It is important because it reflects the policy that is to be adopted by the Administration with regard to the natural re sources of Alaska and to the Nation at large. The message of the President is the most significant so far as Alaska is concerned, that has been delivered to the Congress in many years, because it gives recognition to the needs of Al aska. and urges the development of the Territory, in a manner that cannot be mistaken either by Congress or the people. Admitting that a double duty faces Congress and the Admin istration in regard to Alaska the President states emphatically that thf people of this Territory should be given a full territorial form of government, and Alaska as a storehouse should be un locked. l'he key to unlock that storehouse, he says, is a system of railroads, controlled by the government in the interest of all who wish to use them. It is pointed out that the construction of railroads is but the first step ? the thrusting in of the key to the storehouse ami throwing back the bolts of the lock and open ing the door. II >w the resources are then to be developed will form a polciy which must be worked out by well-considered stages, not upon theory, but upon lines of practical expediency, this being a part of the general problem of conservation. The President is emphatic in his statement that the resources of the country must be used, and not locked up. They must not be de stroyed or wasted; used but not monopolized upon any narrow ideas of individual rights as against the abiding interests of the communities. The President is confident that a policy can Ik- worked out by conference and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopardize them or dissipate them. A policy that will enable the vast latent resources of this Territory to be developed along comprehensive lines is thus clearly foreshadowed. Alaskans may take courage because of these frank words of the President. It is the first declaration in favor of a policy that will enable Alaska to be unbottled that has been enunciated at Washington. It deals with a question, momentous to the people, fairly and squarely. It is a declaration of good faith and an expressed promise to put into motion those agencies of government which will enable the vast natural re sources of the Territory to be put to legitimate use, and it may now be confidently expected that the barriers to the completest development of Alaska along permanent lines, and in the inter- ^ ests of the people, will be speedily removed. < But while the material development of Alaska is urged, the references to its political development is marked in the Pres ident's message. Evidently it is believed that Alaska does not yet enjoy the full political advantages to which her people are t nt it led. and a more complete form of territorial government is demanded, before the doubel duty by which Congress and the Administration is confronted can be discharged. Other commanding features of the message are his advo cacy of primary Presidential nominations, and recommendations that the merely formal nominating conventions, be made up of m n already members of the Congress, or who are candidates for election to that body, the idea being that in this manner party pi 'forms will b#> framed by those responsible to the peo ple for carrying them into effect. Whether this plan would be practicable or not, it at least would be unique. Mexican affairs are handled courageously in the message. It is made plain that Mexico now has no government, the attempt to maintain one having broken down, but in its stead is a military despotism sot up by a usurper of constitutional authority, and the perdiction is made that Huerta's power and prestige are crum bling and the collapse is not far away. If Standard Oil is financing the Mexican Constitutionalists, as alleged, it must be admitted that John D.'s company are get ting a run for their money. 

ALASKA RAILROAD BILL. IT IS not likely that the Alaska railroad bill will be called up in Congress on Dec. 8, next, the day set for its consideration. The currency bill is in the way, and in all probability it will have the right of way until it is disposed of. But it is equally certain that the railroad bill will not lose its place on the calen dar. which will give it first place after the currency bill. The friends of the Alaska bill will see to it that it is not lost sight of, and its early consideration is made doubly sure in view of the President's pronouncement in his message on Alaska affairs. The currency bill is an important measure. The insistent needs of the country demand its early passage, and the Alaska bill will not be jeopardized should it not come up for discus sion and passage until the beginning of the New Year. Dictator Huerta must be taking things rather quietly since he finds time now and then to spend a day at his farm. It may be, however, that he is contemplating an early return to the sim ple life.
