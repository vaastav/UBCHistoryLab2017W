Many of them ha\'e finally come to see their error , and have . . tried through publicity bureaus to educate the public to a different - ent view than. that which the common . people had obtained. Thcre has undoubtedly been much truth and justice in what has been sent out-in the effort to change public sentiment--but the work of education came too late. It fell on unwitling and unprejudiced cars-cars that . have become couvinced that ' .no oed thing- can come out of Nazareth. " [ i'or years the opinions - ions of the public were ignored , amI then when it was found that a selfish : ourse had placed public opinion against them , many interests suddenl , wolte up anel vigorously attempted to brin a change about but it was too late. 'l'he } mblic is like a woman scorneil-slte wants revenge e\'en if it injure herself. It is probable that the public has gone far enough in somc instances to injure its own interests , but this is what would be expected. The way to secure fair treatment is to . give it-before being dr'en iu a corner anel compelled to be just. 'rhe corporations which pursue such a course need nevel fear what the llublic in this count.ry win insist upon having done , li'air treatment ' begets . the same in return. Now the government is after the druggist trust. It is hoped this investigation will not ha\'e the same effect on the price of drugs as the prosecution of the print paper trust. Since the report went out that the combination - bination between the manufacturers - urers of paper had been smashed , the price of print paper has ad vanced $8 per ton. No message of a president has been awaited with more 1nterest than the one of President Roose- velt' which was delivered to congress on Tues ay. It proved to be a logical one , interesting and deals intelligently with the live issues. . 117 Duahel. in 9 Houn. An item recentl.r published stated thatFrnnk Cramer shuckcd 113 bushels of coni in nine hours on the James Raines place. . Last Friday on the . Swope place , farmed by Clarence Franklin , the Cramer record was beaten by George 1.'appan who shucked 1i7 bushels in the same length of time. Tappan , who is about 19 yenrs 01(1 ( , 111 mentioning - ing the matter , said : "Y OLl can bet I didn't stop to discuss wilh anybo y as to whether President Roosevelt was right or wrong in ordering the discharge of the nigger troops. " I Corn $2 a Duahel. E. W. 'Vagner , an , operat r on the Chicago board of trade , has issued an interesting pamphlet in which he takes the ground that denatured alcohol will put corn up to $2 a bushel and corn land up o $300 to 5500 per cre. He says : "Corn is the biggest , readiest and best producer of alcohol in the world. Alcohol is the best and cheapest available source of light , heat arld motive power 111 the world. Light , heat and motive power arc the three agents closest allied to the civilization , development and advancement of the industrial world a d the COI1- ' ortable existence of mantdnd. Those who consi er this funny laugh ; those who think it not \rue should sell the corn crop of 1906 short , but the farmer who (1isposes of his corn below 40 cents at home is throwing a way money. " To OUlt Convict Lobar. The Bureau oLLabor has just iss cd a report devotpd entirel ) ' to the discussion of convict labor. The tendency of various state to engage in the manufacture of goods in competition with free labor is occasioning much adverse criticism , for it not only estab. lishes a dangerous precedent but it' is inimical to the 1Uterests of both commerce and labor , 'rhe dealcr and workingman and ta . payers in assisting to support the penal institution , are thus placed 111 the position of creating and aiding a rival with whom they cannot hope to compete in th open market.

' Aa Seen by the Inapector. The Uniuersity Journal , published - lished at LincoJ11 , contains an article from the pen of T. Mordy Hodgman , state inspector of high schools , in which he obsen'es the Broken Bow schools as follows : . . "Broken Bow has made remarkable - markable impro\'ements this year -espcciall ) ' 111 its scientific and library equipment. For .rears the burden of hard times and \lnulating debt has l < ept this school sadly deficient in adequate 'plant , scientific , equipment , library and course ofstudy. Now all is changed and Broke\1 Bow bids fair in the near future 1 < J become a strong leader in th < : western part'of the state. Thi happ ) ' transformation is due tc better times , an ambitious board and its efficient superintendent , J. M. l\IcImloo. Having foUl high school instructors , a sURer- intendent trained and experienced in normal methods and a wide I territory seeking better ru ra1 teachers , Broken Bow has \ i elJ undertaken the normal tra1UlUg , course but the courses will.be . carried strictly on the fitan ards su gested in the pubhshed I syllabi. \ .
