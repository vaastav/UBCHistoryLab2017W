The N. Y. Courier and Enquirer is not suited, and criticizes severely : "As for the recommendations of the mes sage in regard to a convention to change the constitution to suit Svnth Varolitia, and for thc purpose of carrying slavery into the ter ritories, it is all boh. The people of the United States love the Union ;but they have just prnclaimed trumpit-tongued through the ballot boxes, that they do not love the institution of slavery. They have said "Let it alone," and conline it to the limits of thc states which love it. We will have nothing to do with it. It is local, not national : nnd the general poveinment shall not nieddle with it. A e wih protect everv Mate in the enjnyment ot tl;e institution, but we will not recognize its presence in our Territoric.t. And in lhe fuee of all this Mr Buchanan ask i a cnange in tne constitution by these ver i people, for the express purpose of making ; them stullify themselves and repudiate theii j recent vote agamst slavery excitenrjnt. The N. Y. News (Douglas)is disappointed. It says : "Either from lack of natural capacitv to grasp so great a question, or through the ob structing dissensions of a heterogeneous rab inet, Mr Buchanan has failed to come up to our expectauons. The Albany Journal is perplexed : as thus "There is evidence, in the structuie of this ', message, and upon its f'ace, that it was con- I ceived and written in a patnotic spint, and j with a lofty purpose.

The 1 crops were abundant, there was a good de- ', mand for allourmanufactures.sterling change '. was below par, and the commerce of the country was increasing. Now money is tight, 1 failures are occurring every day and another financial crisis is imminent. The cause of all this is to be found m the insolvent position ofthe South. With prosperitv in every nar-. ticular, for the last few years, prices have ad-. vanced in that section, land as well as slaves 1 have increased m valuc,and there was a thor- ough mfiation in all the departments of bu- year, together with the disunion flurry, have caused a close contraction on the part of the bank., which have wif.drawn their balances i frm vcn. v,l- imntB TnKt,d ?

Jlumpshire Gaziile, Montgomery and Kansas. The difticulties in Southern Kansas are at an eiid, and arrests are made without difficul ty, the United States troops making them selves useful as a sheritf 's posse. The re ports of outrages by Montgomery have add ed somethir.g to Soutliern exaspuration, and have satisfied the rest of the country that it is the presidcnt's duty to remove at once the incompelent Judge VillianiS, who has raised an unnecessary alarm for purposes of niis chief. He is as unpopular as a judge as he is malicious as a politician. A recent iettei Montgomery has had no thought of hreak- ing ui) fiis court. sackiiir the towns on the border, invading Missouri, or in any nianner interfering with fier slaves. has received no money or arms from Uoton, or anywhere else in the Kast, yet this strong pro slavery anu partisan Juilge, unuer the mhiience of his Inghteneu linaginaiion, and knowing the excitement on the secession movement,would throw firebrands, arrows and death, would fan the Hame, widen the breach, and plunge the country into inevitable ruin, if he could. The courts of this im'oecile old fogy are a mockery of justice. God pity the people is sent to rule over. 1 he lawvers him, and the one that can Co u the oet whether he has justice on his guins his casr side or not. Wyandot county used to be in cluded in his ditrict, but sujfering under the galling yoke of his imbecility, and the greai uncertainty of seeing justice adtninivtered in his court. they netitioned and lobbied tiic legislalure, and got transferred to Judg.- Peltit's district a first-rate judge.and I hope Lincoln will keep him in as long as we arein territorial vassalage ; also the same of Judge Klmore ; but this old fojjy Williams is the greatest nuisance in the territory, except th U.
