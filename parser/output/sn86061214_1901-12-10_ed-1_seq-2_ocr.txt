'The cocaine habit is but little known to' the outside world except' in 'Such cases where the victim eithef dies or betrays the habit by some eccentric! ty that is not accounted for in the list of sins that are attributed to alco hol. Cocaine is deadly in .its effects after a certain period has passed, and this too in a comparatively short time from the beginning of the habit. It is cumulative in effect and when tlip poor victim is once\ enthralled, it is almost impossible for him to break from its influence. These observa tions are prompted from the sad case of a young negro, about twenty years of age, who died in this city on Tues day night in convulsions produced from the use of the deadly drug. He was at one time a promising young colored man, prompt in the discharge of Ms duties but during the past three months he has been yielding more and more to the accursed habit, until he expended all of his wages for co coaine. It was noted of him also,that he became cross, ill-natured and dis posed to quarrel with those who had been his best friends his countenance changed to one of desperation and lrensy his eyes protruded and glared as the eye's of a wild beast finally he was taken with serious symptoms,and brought into shelter, where medical relief was applied, but it was too late ht died in great (agqny. II. is part of the penalty of being a i.e-gro that these people are driven to ,100 use of cocoaine because negroes -not wanted in the saloons. It is ,t,U'i that they are served at such places, but it is in such a way that it la unpleasant for them. They do not often return and finally seek'relief in drugs that have no odor, are easily procured in some places, without re gard to age, sex, color, or previous condition of servitude. These, drugs iare sold for money and the sale of such drugs forms a considerable part of the trade .of certain establishments. The habit is deadly, the trade is atro c:ous it is doing a great evil to the people of all races, but to the colored people especially, because there are no restraints to the sale of it so far as they are concerned indeed it is hinted that agents of the trade, can vass the city and sell to negroes at their houses and receive pay in daily installments. The drug is sold at an enormous profit and if a day's sale is lost, the trader can well afford to lose it. •RET" CLARKSON, FOR POSTMAS TER GENERAL. It is said that Postmaster General 'V I Smith is to retire from the cabinet of Jnient and Mr. Hinrichsen takes the President Roosevelt within the pres-1 matter up in a manner that brings it ent month and that his successor is to directly home to the individual citi be James S. Clarkson, of Iowa, at pres-' ent living in New York City. Mr. Smith 1B said to be anxious to resume his editorial duties on the Philadel phia PresB. Gen. Clarkson was asked liy a reporter to make a statement concerning the matter, but refused. It seems certain that he has been call ed to Washington. Mr. Clarkson has lived in New York a number of years engaged in important business' enter* prises. He was at one time chair man of the national republican com mittee and is now very close to Sen ator Thomas C. Piatt, and other pow erful leaders. It must not be forgotten that the duties of Postmaster General are con genial to Mr. Clarkson he was first assistant postmaster general during President Harrison's term. John Wan r.umaker was postmaster general, and a ureat part of the duties incumbent upon a postmaster general were per formed by Mr. Clarkson, to the entire ,tis-factlon of his chief, of the'Presl •l r.t snd of the country. Mr. Clark introduced some important im ovwents in the postal service dur i'i the time he held office and assist to lay the foundations of that al perfect system which is in vogue A U.y. If .• iiii.es S. Clarkson had remained 'Li Iowa, he could hav$ been either governor or United States senator, but it was never his habit to stand in the way of friends or ot prominent Icwa. men who &«pir«d to rank and po pittoa. "Eat" wai always serving in ihe interest ot friends and promoting Ployed 

TSJK V* t' -wi j** the principles to which he was so thor oughly devoted and took little heed of his own chances or opportunities to/ political advancement. The,administration could do nothing greater in one act .to commend itself to Iowa people than in recognizing Mr. Clarkson and selecting him as an important member of the cabinet. He, although he has for years been a res ident" ot another state, is still regarded as "Ret," and one whom we are all prijud to recognize as having once been-one of the foremost citizens of a state that will delight to receive him back again Whenever it is his pleas ure to come. THE PENSIONS QONSIDERED. in this issue of the Courier will be found tin article, with Statistics, from the, report of the commissioner of pen sions, showing that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1901, there were 1,041,321 pensioners, an increase of 4,206, as compared wi'tJi" the number of pensioners at the close of the fis cal .year 1900N*$his is over 54.0&0 in excess of any previous y«ars -and'con stitutes '.'high wat»£r .mark" ,in the his tory, ot the bureau. ..Thai additions to the roll during the ^ear consisfed of «52S "new' Jensioners^3fh(t 3,65? re storations, a total of 47.^2,',^'hile the loiSfies Jo the^rglls during ths."same: pe riod- from d'eathb* and other causes, were 43,586-- -The report refers to not only pension claims -oifUnion soldiers. but to those of the 'Fiorid-a-war.sokUers little soldiers\pf the §pah,|^ wajr. -:Tho fig ures of the* latest' troftiiantR are in some! degr^p alarming .but the figures as to the old "soldiers of the war. of th^rebellion are' assuring to tjhose whoybewail tfe~ enormity of thei pen sion list and hope to see it speedily 'reduced:-'--- The selfishness of these peo ple is soon to be rewarded.. The fig ures show that the veterans of the civil wiar are rapidly disappearing.

A PICTURESQUE DESCRIPTION. President Roosevelt's, first message abounds in epigrams but in no single sentence of the document^'is there more beauty of'description apd at the same time fearful signipcance than that one wbicli' r6terk to anarciiy, in -11-• these words: •,- ..... "If ever anarchy is trumphant, its triumph will last for bub one red mo ment, to'be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism." There is a volume in the sentence. It is'"plain and requires no elaborate explanation and yet ,one lingers over it in love with it, for l(s picturesque description.! .We caij, in .imagination see that-red^ moment, when' all govern ments have ceased tmd Society 'in a •state of chaos no officers of. the law, no.-law-, no power to control the bois terous, nor to protect the innocent! It will surely last but a moment, for the man will appear with the hour— the Man on Horseback, who will come to rule, and the people will gladly ac claim him emperor, dictator, king of kings and award him all the wealth they posses if he will but give them peace! AN 

INTERESTING STUDY. The second of a series of twelve articles on "Practical Politics" by Hon. Wm. H. Hinrichsen, of Chicago, is published in the Courier this week. The speoial topic of this article is th6 study' of civil' govern- zen in every community. Among the questions asked are, "Who are our public officials? What are their terms of office? What are their duties?" There is also careful instruction as to the best manner of making a study of the election laws by which our of ficials are elected to office. Mr. Hin richsen then takes up ,the question of political geography and suggests that one of the first things that a student of practical politics should become ac quainted with, is the boundary of his own voting precinct, its population and the strength of the different par ties represented therein. The young man who desires to understand our system of government and to make himself an influentiaf'force in the com munity in which he resides, will find in these articles of Mr. Hinrichsen, matter of greatest inter est and value. The old wheel horses of the various parties will be, equally interested with the student of poli tics in the revelations made in these articles as to the extent to which par ty organization is carried in those cities and states that are recognized as being close in politics. IOWA MANUFACTURES. Census bulletin No. 114, just publish ed- by the United States Census depart ment "hsu* been received, arid shows some interesting facts and figures. From it we learn that Ottumwa has 160 manufacturing establishments small, and great that the capital em ployed i« $3,403,321.

There are a number of cities in Iowa that have more manufacturing plants than Ottumwa, as for instance, Burlington has 340 and Ottumwa only 160, but the total value of products manufactured gives over nine millions of dollars to Ottumwa and but five .millions and less than-a half, to Burlington. Ot tumwa ranks sixth in the value of manufactured products among Iowa cities. Tile five cities which surpass it are in their order, Sioux City, 1st Cedar Rapids, 2nd Davenpbrt, 3rd, Dubuque. 4th Des Moines, 5th. The place which Des Moines occupies ill this list will be a great surprise to the public generally. THE TARIFF AND RECIPROCITY. The present tariff that has given such excellent results—Prosperity and wide employment of labor where there had been prior to its adoption, hard times and little remuneration to labor —is to be attacked in the present con gress and in the house of its friends. Representative Babcock, of Wisconsin, mistakes the true meaning of recipro city as declared for by McKinley and by President Roosevelt, and if his the ories were carried out there would be the protective features of be lost in the reciprocity measures that are now being pressed upon the country, some of them by men who have never been friendly to the doc trine of protection. The real question that confronts the country now is, what more can labor or capital desire than is presented in the conditions as they are today? La bor has good wages and capital is eaining good returns. Who will haz ard this pleasant situation in order to establish a new systcia that may bring disaster? We are sure of the prosperity as conditions aro now we imperil the interests of both labor and capital if we try a new scheme in-' deed it is not a new scheme but an old device, under a new name. This does not imply that we should ignore the reciprocity measures so fa vorably endorsed by the late lamented President, Mr. McKinley, and by the present President, Mr. Roosevelt neither do we forget that the best fea tures of reciprocity were brought into publicity ana public favor by that great American, James G. Blaine. The reciprocity that Blaine, McKinley and Roosevelt advocated irt public speeches never for one moment lost sighUof that feature of protection that guaranteed to the American laborer and to the American manufacturer, the difference between the wages of a European workingman and the wages that should go to the workingman of America, in order that he may live in the way and manner of an enlighten ed American freeman without coming in competition with the ignorance and the half enslaved condition of the Eu ropean laborer. The friends of protection should write every line of a measure that pro poses reciprocity and the true friends of protection in congress will know fuu well how to vote when such measures are presented. 

PHILIPPINE CONDITIONS. Secretary of War Root has made his report to congress, which is a volumi nous document. The secretary says in part: "We have avoided the premature abandonment of any power necessary to enforce the authority of the United States, and at the same time have held open to the people of every, com munity the. opportunity to escape from the stringency of military rule by- unit ing with us in effective measures to bring about peaceful conditions in the territory which they inhabit. The con ditions do not now permit the abandon ment of military government through out the archipelago. It appears that approximately 74,152 square miles, or 58 per cent of the estimated area of the islands, and 4,902,837 people, or 70 per cent of the estimated population of the islands, are under the civil ad ministration and approximately 53,701 square miles, or 42 per cent of the to tal area, and 2,072,236 people or 30 per cent of the total estimated population, are under military administration. "The civil service law enacted by the Philippine commission September 19, 1900, has been put into successful and satisfactory operation. No officer, high or low, has been appointed upon any one's request, or upon any per sonal, social, or political consideration. A native police force, well officered, can be made faithful and effective, cau be trusted with arms and will be an element of constantly increasing value in the maintenance of order. The latest reports show a little over 6,000 natives employed in the various municipal police forces and between 900 and 1,000 already enlisted in the insular constabulary." The secretary alludes to the tariff regulations and their embarassments and yet the business of the islands has increased during the past year. The following statistics and figures will be of interest to all classes of readers: "The total value of merchandise (ex clusive of army supplies) imported during the fiscal year 1901 wiss $30, 279,406, as against $20,601,436 for the fiscal year 1900 and the total value of merchandise exported during the fist cal year 1901 was $23,214,948, as against $19,751,068 for the fiscal year 1900—an increase of 47 per cent in the, value of imports and an increase ot 17 V» per cent in the value of exports. The imports from the Unitr^ States itr^ *2, -w 3:rA£,„v^. THE OTTUMWA COtJJRIEK: TUESDAY. DECEMBER lO.'lfWi. shdty an increase of 72.4 per cent over the imports of 1900 and the exROrts to the United States show a decrease of 27 per cent from the exports of 1900. The imports from the United Kingdom, from Germany, from France, and from the British East. Indies have increased in a greater prbportion than the im ports from the United States. "The revenue? of the Philippine government during the fiscal year 1901 amounted to $10,817,662.31, as against $6,723.852.1S during the fiscal yeaT 1900. The total expenditures during the fiscal year 1901 amounted to: $6', 763,821.68, as ag:ainst $5.218 38J.1'2 in 1900, making an increase" of revenues of over $4,000,000, and an increase ctf expenditures of about $1,500,000, and a surplus of revenues over expendi tures of $4,053,840.63, as-against a sur plus Qf $1,505,471.06 for the preceding year. Of course the great expendi tures which have been undertaken for public works, education, insular con stabulary, extension of the judicial system, etc., will rapidly dispose of this surplus." The secretary refers to the peaceful processes now on foot to abolish slav ery in the islands. This condition has been tolerated but the time for it to end is now close at hand. -The President .in his first message says the following as to the Indian: "In my judgment the time has arriv ed when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and n6t as a member of a tribe." This is the presidential expression and it differs somewhat from the thought of Theodore Roosevelt oh more than oneoccasion, when he would carefully .raise his head above the top of a hill"and look over on the sky line and tnere see a body of gen tlemen without hats, advancing rapid ly toward him. Then it was that The odore Roosevelt made up his mind to recognize the Indian as not only an individual but the member of a tribe or any other thing that was uncom fortable. Miss Beatrice Fellows, of P) vnntvio England!year back to the proifqrtions of great Re publican good times years, 1890, 1891 and 1892. According to the annual re port just filed with the governor by the state railroad' commission, the averse, wages paid to railroad em ployes during the year just passed were-$1.88 per .day in 1890 they amounted to $2.12 in 1891 they were $1.88, .and. in'lfj?2, $1.89. These are the highest wages in the history of the Iowa railroads. In the hard times of 1893, when the panic first lit been struggling back to the old time republican level ever since. Iowa people will not join with the capitol decoration commission which recommends that four panels be paint ed commemorating the assassination of President McKinley by an anarchist. All national decorations and monu- nients should represent the progress of the country toward a high Civiliza tion We should strive to forget the acts that'ftend' toward degradation. Good taste will object to any repre sentation that will perpetuate the names of Booth, Guiteau or Czolgosz. The names .of Lincoln, Garfield and annals of the republic survive. President Roosevelt's recommenda tion for appropriations for water, awakened some distrust and resentment in Kentucky, until it was ascertained that the irrigation business applies on ly to the dry states and territories west of the Missouri river. 

FROM OTHER VIEWPOINTS. Glidden Graphic: Ctn the surface, it seems-that there is but little need for a session of the Iowa general assembly. But it will be fouhd when the assembly meets that there is amply room for use ful service. Eagle Grove Eagle:- Should this congress fail to take any action as to the revision of the tariff and recipro city, the republican party will go into the next presidential campaign dis credited and dangerously handicapped. Burlington Hawk-Eye: Some people may think Attorney General Mullen of this state, has hurt his political pros pects by having a $500 dog but we do not think so. ,He sold the dog for $nU0 and that shows widsoin and ability. Des Moines Register: Thfe present prospect is that one of the most strenuous contests .of the Iowa legis lature this winter will be oVer the submission of the proposed constitu tional amendment granting the unlimit ed and unrestrained vote to women. Iowa Falls Citizen: If Iowa is to be redietrlcted on account of the new cen sus, let it be done with a little less partisanism. Give the democrats a ."V* -, Act ..

Mason CUy Clobe-Gazette: The great national maiming matches passed into history last Thursday for a year, and the country will needs content itself with the prize fight, which is exceed ingly tame because there is never more than one man killed In the fis tic contests. Monona Leader: The job of redist ricting the state falls to the lot of the general assembly. What it yill do in the matter is a question, but one thing is certain, nothing worse than the present boundaries of the districts, representative, senatorial and congres sional, can be suggested. Davehpct Democrat: The proposed law requiring the judges of the su preme court to maintain offices ill Des Moines ought to be supplemented by a few more conditions such as these— requiring the judges to build houses there to educate their children in the schools of that city to read only Des Moines papers and to vote only tor Des Moines candidates for office. Waverly Independent: We never saw finer November days during Thanksgiving week than the days we enjoyed last week. They don't make finer weather anywhere. Spirit Lake Beacon: Hank Yeager caught 180 dozen frogs Monday for which he received $18. This big catch was made by wading into the lake and using a dip net. As the weather becomes cold the frogs take to the water and are easily taken from their winter quarters with nets. 

PENSIONS. The report of the commissioner of pensions shows that the total number of pensioners on the roll during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1901, was 1,041,321, and the number remaining on the roll at the close of the year was 997.735, an increase of 4,206 as com pared with the number of pensioners at the close of the fiscal year 1900.

The average annual val ue of each pension on June 30, 1901, was $131.87, a slight decrease from the former year, caused by the death of pensioners who were in receipt of high rates of pensions, and by the re duced number of general-law pension ers. The annual average value of 9*/ '., /1 -a The total number of applications for army and na.vy pensions received in the pension /bureau during the year was 218,616 of which number 117,986 were applications for increase. The number of pensioners living in foreign countries at the close of the year was 4,547, to whom was paid in pensions the sum of $641,161.65. There were also 72 pensioners resid ing in our insular possessions, who received during the year the sum of $10,312.89. The number of claims filed under the act of March 3, 1901, which is an amendment of section 4,708 of the re vised statutes, confirming title to res toration of pension-to remarried wid ows under conditions specified in the act, was 3,258. They are being adju dicated as rapidly as the evidence is furnished to complete them. It is not now'practicable to estimate the num ber of persons that will be entitled to the benefits of this act. The number of special acts granting pensions and increase of pensions passed at the first session of the Fifty sixth congress was 684, and the num ber passed at the second session was 707, making a total of 1,391 special acts for the congress. A net decrease is shown in the num ber of pensioners for the old wars for service prior to March 4, 1861 of 4, 884 a net increase in the number of those pensioned on account of the war of the rebellion of 3,301 in in crease in the number pensioned on account of the war with Spain of 5,604, and 16.610 pensions were granted to widows under the act of June 27, 1890, or nearly 4,500 in excess of the num ber granted the previous yeair, the re sult of the act of May 9, 1900, amenda tory of the former law. The total amount paid to pension ers during the year as first payments upon the allowance of their claims was $9,934,763.54. These payments were on account of arrears of pension which are becoming smaller each year by reason of the progress which has been made in bringing the adjudi cation of claims current, thereby les sening the "arrears" period between date of filing the claim and the date of its settlement. There are, however, many claims adjudicated carrying large sums as 'arrears," 675 of these having been allowed during the year, in which the first payment averaged near $1,500 each. The amount paid as fees to attor neys during the year was $591,245.22, an increase of $73,868.90 over the pre vious year. The commissioner re ports that this increase wag caused by the allowance of Spanish war claims, in nearly all of which the attorneys had filed agreements from claimants for a $25 fee, although most of the claims required very little service on the part, of the attorney aside i'rom the preparation of the declamation. FOUND IN THE TALL GRASS, Rock Rapids Reporter: Local agents report that never before have their traina carried so many passengers as now, Schaller Herald: Farmers are near ly all done picking corn. A few be lated ones are still at it, but will close up the work soon. Sheldon Mail: M. C.

Those who are able to hold onto their corn will receive a record breaking price for it next summer. Those who are obliged to sell now are not kicking on the present prices. Ringgold Record: Jt is now said to be quite stylish for girls to wear their hats over their right ear.
