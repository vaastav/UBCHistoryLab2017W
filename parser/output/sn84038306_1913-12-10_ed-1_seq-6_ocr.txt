Boston, Dec. 5.—Fire which de stroyed the Arcadia lodging house at 1202 ^asMngtOD street caused the death of 27 persons on Wednesday. This is the heaviest death toll ever re corded in a fire in Boston. Two persons were fatally Injured while more than a score were slightly hurt or overcome by smoke. There were 179 men asleep in the lodging house when the fire broke out. The flames spread swiftly through the flimsy building and a number of men, caught on the upper floors, leaped from windows. All of the victims were poverty stricken men, the lodging housfe being a 15-cent-a-night affair,, catering to the poor. Many 6f them were home less wanderers and for this reason the authorities believe that the names of all the victims will never be known. .The conflagration was attended by many thrilling escapes. Firemen spread nets and into these many of the panic-stricken lodgers leaped. One man wrapped a mattress around his body, and jumped from the fifth floor, the mattress saving his life. The great rapidity with which fire leaped from floor to floor caught the lodgers and scores awoke to find their beds hemmed in by flames. There they clung as the flames belched from windows beneath them and crept across the beds they, had vacated to the sills of the'windows. Several narrowly escaped being hurled from the coping into'the street in the tush for the ladders, which fell Just short of the coping on which they were clinging. The firemen as cended as fur as they could and caught the lodgers as they jumped to the tops of the ladders four stories in the air. Medical Examiner Leary, after an examination at the scene of the fire, declared: "I am going at this matter with ah ax. This is one of the greatest crimes ever, committed in this city. An in quest will be started at once. I think we have taken all the bodies from the ruins. Boston has nearly a dozen such fire traps. It is a crime to allow them to exist.
