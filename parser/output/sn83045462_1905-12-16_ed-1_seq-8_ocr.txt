Meeting Last Night of Representatives of Board of Trade and Business Men's Association. In rcspc rtse to invitations from, the board of directors of the Young Men's Chris tian Association about 200 members of the Board of Trade and the Business Men's As sociation gathered in the new association building >n G street northwest last even ing. The visttors were met In the lobby by a committee from the Y. M. C. A. board of directors and after chatting for a short time they were conducted through the new structure from basement to roof garden. Following those investigations several speeches were made concerning the asso ciation work and "The Club" for business men. Then the party adjourned to the third floor, where refreshments were served. I,ast night marked the formal opening of "The Club." the feature of the new build ing which is provided especially for the business men of the city, whose generosity made the 'building possible, and, it Is be lieved, will continue to make it a success. After tin; visitors had been shown through the ouilding and the cltrb features had been explained to them, application blanks for membership were given away and several of those present filed application. The club is expected to prove a popular feature among business men. It was announced that Mr Cuno H. Rudolph had accepted the pros dency of the club for the first year ar.d to ] im will be Intrusted the work uf putting It on a successful basis. The Addresses. After the business men of the city had been si own around, President Woodward called the meeting to order in the lobby and pol ited out that the magnificent new building provided for the Y. M. C. A., which had been admired by thousands of visitors since its completion, was due ft) the generosity of men of money and influ ence. Without their help it could not have been built; they were absolutely the bacK bone of the building, he said. It was there fore thought to be only proper that room should b.! provided in the building for these men. Therefore, two handsome rooms on the ground floor were set aside for the men's club and It was hoped the men would avail themselves of the opportunity af forded. Following President Woodward, Vice President Macfarland spoke on the new building from the city side. Responding to the critics who say there Is no civic pride in the city, he pointed out the fact that almost ail of the 3,000 subscribers to the building fund in the association campaign are residents of this city and that nearly all the ir oney that went Into the new build ing cam; from, the pockets and bank ac counts of Washingtonlans. Here, he main tained. was the finest example of civic pride, and he i irtlier argued that this civic pride would b' exhibited in the future by con tinued Interest of the local people in the as sociation The association, he said, was a spiritual bank, which is alwajs able to pay off all Its creditors, in which deposits are surely safe and which never skips a divi dend. Club Features. John B. pieman, jr., was the next speaker and he took up specifically the club feat ures. Not only does it entitle the member to the full membership privileges of the association, but to many special and addi tional privileges. Among the extras are two richly furnished club rooms on the main floor, with library, reading table, writing desks and suitable games, large private dressing rooms and sanitary steel lockers free Tui kish and Russian baths under the supervision of an expert and the use of the large gymnasium, gymnasium annex, hand ball. fen -lug and other individual exercises The membership of the club will be lim ited to 200.

RUSSIANS ROBBING JEWS. Homes of the Wealthy Pillaged by Organized Bands. A cablegram from Warsaw. Russian Po land, last night says: Many wealthy Jews are leaving this city owing to the raids on their residences by bands of revolutionary co-religionists calling themselves anarch ists. . The latter Invade the houses and flats of rich Jews demanding large sums at the points of revolvers, and in case of a refusal they plunder the premises of Jewels and money and destroy the furniture. The police are so disorganized that they make no attempt to interfere STORM FROM THE GULF. Much Damage and Inconvenience South and Southwest. A dispatch from Louisville, Ky. laat night says: The gulf rtorm which has been causing heavy precipitation In Texas and Louisiana for the past two days has moved eastward, bringing snow Into Arkansas, rain and sleet In Tennessee, and rain, sleet and snow In part* of Kentucky, while un settled conditions prevail generally In the entire district south of Ohio and east of the Mississippi. Ijoulsvllle's annual visitation of sleet ar rived a month or more ahead of time, and today Is causing eerious delay to all wire communication, while street car service In the city was interfered with more or less. The telegraph companies report a loss of from e'ght to ten wires on every route out of the city, to say nothing of the inter rupted facilities* for communication to suburban and nearby coiyity towns. Only two wlrc9 were left on the main artery of communication from Louisville to the south, and the sleet In Louisville turned to snow. Rain has been falling at Mobile and Birm ingham for two days and nights, and other cities have experienced steady precipitation for more thatt* day. Burned to Death in Stamp Mill Fire.

GONTROLOFINSURANCE MR. COCKRAN ARGUES FOR USE OF THE TAXING POWER. The House yesterday devoted four and three-quarters hours to lively debate on the possibilities of controlling Insurance com panies. Two set speeches were the feat ures. One, by Mr. Bherley of Kentucky, bore on the doctrine of states' rights, and the other, by Mr. Cockran of New York, related to the actions of the officers who manage the big life Insurance companies of his state, Mr. Cockran proposing that Con gress. through Its taxing power, should con fine all Insurance companies to the state In which they are organised. Mr. Mann of Illinois outlined a proposed means of control he will later present in the form of a bill, leaving It to the Insur ance companies to voluntarily submit to federal examination and approval. Mr. Wil liams, the minority leader, closed the de bate, holding that control was possible, but not through the taxing power. No conclusion was reached on the com mittee reference of the insurance feature of the President's message, which is the matter under consideration. In his eloquent speech Mr. Cockran said that the remedy was to confine insurance companies to the state in which they -were organized, the same as savings banks are confined. ' Believe me," he declared, "there Is not the need of paying a salary of $150. 000 a year by any insurance company to protect its policy holders, but It Is necessary to get a man to swindle them." Mr. Cockran described the method of stock gambling practiced by insurance companies, and said that the thousands of successful instances left no record behind. It was only the few failures, where the companies were required to make good, that a record was made. "Rockefeller's fortune is a monument to crime," declared Mr. Cockran, "and he does not deny it." "It is time we should consider the awful effect of criminals still holding* the offices they have abused," he added. The situation, Mr. Cockran said In conclu sion. was such that Congress was bound to take action. He beMeved this action should be to limit Insurance companies to the state in which they were organized. He believed a special committee should be appointed to secure that action. Mr. Adams tPa.,) called attention to the recent hazing at Annapolis and the provi sion for the expulsion of midshipmen engag ing in hazing. The code of honor of the academy was denounced by Mr. Adams, and he declared It was time for Congress to take action to prevent the recurrence of re cent disgraceful events. Mr. Williams criticised life Insurance officers In New York. He declared that If they had not stolen, they had abused their trust, especially when they gave large cam paign contributions where the money was not their own. Mr. Burke (Pa.) interrupted to ask If the courts of the state of New York were not under the control of the political party to which Mr. Williams belonged. This was resented by Mr. Williams, who said it was degrading the discussion of a broad ques tion to a partisan fling. He might make return in-kind if he wished to, he continued. "Is the gentleman not from Pennsylvania?" he asked. (Laughter). "Is he not also from the city of Philadelphia?" Mr. Burke re joined that Pennsylvania was not com posed entirely of the city of Philadelphia. "But," rejoined Mr. Williams, "the Im pression prevails in many parts of this country tnat the absolute republicanism In Pennsylvania is due to the sardine-like condition of things in the city of Philadel phia, which has recently so far surpassed the history about Boss Tweed, or anything else that ever wore the uniform and bore the name of the democracy of New York city, that these old characters are rush lights of corruption to the sunlight of the rank rottenness of Philadelphia." With this fling, which was received with laughter, Mr. Williams concluded his re marks and the House at 4:45 adjourned until today. 

TRAGEDY AT CLEVELAND. Terrible Work of Man Discharged From Insane Asylum. A dispatch from Cleveland, Ohio, last night says: William Guy, just discharged from the Newburg Insane asylum, shot and killed his brother-in-law. Harry Flint, aged fifteen, and an elgh teen-months-old child at 280 Brownell street today. Guy then went to 314 Central avenue and .fatally wounded Mrsc Elizabeth Bennett. He was larter arrested. He Is a wire-drawer, and twenty-nine years of age. Guy had been In the insane asylum three years, and upon his return home declared that he found his wife had been?wnfaithful. This apparently renewed his maniacal frenzy and he procured a revolver. He killed his young brother-in-law as the boy was riding a bicycle in front of his home, and then went into the house and shot the baby, which he says was born to his wife while he was in confinement. He then started to find his wife, who had left home previously. He went to the house of Mrs. Bennett, who was a close friend of Mrs. Guy. He shot once at his wife, but missed her, and she escaped. He then shot Mrs. Bennett and ran from the house with the revolver still in his hand. The police by this time were on his trail, and after a short chase he was captured and lockedi up. He talked freely of his crime, and expressed no regret except that of failing to kill his wife. Mrs. Bennett is not expected to live more than a few hours. FATAL REAR-END COLLISION. Two Trainmen Killed and One Seri ously Scalded. | A dispatch from Newcastle, Pa., last night says: Engineer J. J. Welsh and Brakenmn | J. A. Harris were Instantly killed and Fife man O. W.

The Morrell measure recites that the Secretary of War has sub mitted a report upon the canteen law show ing that its effect has been to increase drunkenness, disease, insubordination and deeertion and moral and physical degener ation. and as other reports of the War De partment show that all of the generals in service except two, all of the ten colonels of the cavalry, all of thp seven colonels of the artillery, all of the forty-nine colonels of the Infantry, save one, and 504 out of 516 commanding officers of companies, bat teries and troops for one reason or another are opposed to the law. It Is further stated that the testimony of 00 per cent of offi cers in command of posts has Indicated that the law has Increased drunkenness, deser tion, absence without leave and trials by court-martial; that the condition of health has deteriorated and that morality and dis cipline have been injuriously affected. The present chief of staff is quoted as having failed attention to reports of division and department commanders as to the bad ef fects following the passage of the law. The measure says that in view of all these things the anti-canteen law if repealed is to go into effect immediately upon the pas sage of the Morrell measure.

WEBER PIANOLA PIANO Now recognized through the length and breadth as "The Modern Type of HISTORY is making more rapidly in the industrial field than many of us fully i realize. Only a few years ago the first automobile was regarded as a curiosity. To day city streets and country roads are full of them, and millions of dollars are invested in the industry. In the realm of music the great invention of the age is the Pianola Piano. Like the au tomobile, its practical efficiency was no sooner established than a tremendous field opened up before it. People everywhere were eager to be among the first to install in their homes an instrument which was seen to be of such epoch-making character. Now that its success has become so apparent, the only wonder in people's minds is that the idea was not thought of long ago. As a matter of fact, the idea of incorpo rating a Pianola in a piano dates back to the very invention of the Pianola itself - years ago. seven rutin* SANDERS & STAYMAN CO., Exclusive Agents, SI PERCY S.
