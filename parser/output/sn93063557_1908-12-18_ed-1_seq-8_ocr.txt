Venezuelan Govornmont Failed to Mako Good tho Threat to Fire on Ships Committlng Hostile Act, Al though Guardshlp Is Taken Undor the Very Guns of Puorto Cabodo A Reprisal Against Castro Willemstd, Island ot Curacao, Dec. 14. Tho Dutch crulser Gelder land came into thls port towlng tho Venezuelan coast guard shlp Allx, wth the Dutch flag flylng and a Dutch crow on board. Tho Gelderland cap turcd tho Allx off Pucrto. Cabcllo on Saturday. At tho tlme tho Allx was lylng close ln shoro, and notwthstandlng tho threat whlch tho Venezuelan gov- crnment had mado to flro upon any of the Dutch warnlips commlttlng a hos tile act, tho Geldcrand steamcd at speed towards tho guardshlp and selzed lt. No shot came from tho forts on land. The tezure o tho Allx was ln ac cordance wth the plana of Tho Neth erlands government whenl Instruc tlons weie ssued to tho threo Dutch warshps now ln these waters to mako a dmonstraton off the coast of Veno zuela and to capture any Venezue lan ships of war or guard vessels that they might llnd. Naturally tho peoplo of Curacao, who have long been clamorng for ac tlvity by the Dutch government, aro grcatly rejoced over tliis evidenco that Holland has at last beguij ac- tlve measurcs against Venezuela, but the governor of Curacao, in explain Ing the ncident, had thls to say: I "The capture hy our warshps of coost guards and war vessels is not to be consldercd an unfrlendly act against the Venozuelans. "It is merely a reprisal against Castro's government, whlch refuses lo 1 give batsfaction for hls unfrlendly acts towards Holland. "The selziu-e of these vessels wlll make s mposshlo for tho Venezulai; nnent to carry troops or ammunl tlon to and from the various ports. "A communlcatlon to thls effect ha3 been forwarded by the Dutch gov ernment to the German minlster at Caracas." German Cheers For Castro Merlln, Dec. 15. President Castro ,of Venezuela arrived here last evcn. ing. Xo precautlons had been taken to prevent the public from crowdlng the platforms, and as tho traln steamed into the depot the president was greeted with shouts of "Long llve Castro!" There was a gerieral llftlng of hats and much cheering.

Now York, Dec. 16. The World, in thc courso of its answer to Presi dent Uoosevelt's refercnces to that paper in his speclal message to con gress, says: "Mr. Hoosevelt is mlstaken. Ho cannot muzzlo The World. White no amount of blllingsgate on his part 1 can alter our determlnatin to treat hlm wlth judlcial impartlallty and scrupulous falrncss, wo repeat what we have already sald, that tho con- i gress of the Unlted States should make a thorough lnvesttgation of the whole Panama transactlon, that the full truth may bo known to the Amcrican people. "The World fully appreciates tho compltment paid to it by Mr. Roose- ! velt in making it the subject of a speclal message to the congress ot the Unlted States. "The World likowlse appreciates ' the Importanco and significance of Mr. Uoosevelt's statement when ho declares to congress that the proprie- tor of The World should be prose cuted for libel by tho governmental authorities and that the attorney general has under consideraton the form under whioh tho procoedlngs against Mr. Pulltzer shall bo brought.

Nelther the king of Great Britain nor the German Emperor would ven turo to arrogato such power to him self. John Adams' attempt to en force the sedltion law destroyed tho Fcderallst party ln America. Yet Mr. Roosevelt, in tho abscnco .ot law, offlcially proposes to useall tho power of the greatest government on earth to crlpple tho freedom of tho press on tho pretext that tho government itself has been Ilbellcd, and he is the government. "It is true that The World prlnt ed tho public reports concornlng thf Panama canal affalr wlich resulted from Wlltiam Nclson Cromwell's ap peal to the dlstrict attorney's ofllco durlng the recont campaign to pre vent the publication of a story whlch was sald to bo in the hands of tho Democratic national committeo.
