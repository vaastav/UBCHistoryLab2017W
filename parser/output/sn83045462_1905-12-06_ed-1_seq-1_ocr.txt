Reported Safe in Winter Quarters at King Point. SEATTI.E. Was t:., December 6.?Ma J. Glassford, in charge of the government cable ..ffice here, received a mess.ge yes terday addressed to Xansen. the Norweg an explorer, at I'hristlania. from Capt. Ronald Amundsen of the ship GJoa, at Port Eg bert, Eagle City, Alaska, telling of a trip by a dog te-jm from Herschel Island to Eagle City. While the message is incomplete in de tails, it purports to be from a member of an exploring party sent out by Nansen. and states that the party is safe with the ship GJoa. wintering at K ng Point. The message also .-. ys that the American whaling fleet Is held in the ice in the v:c.n Ity of Herschel Island and that ail of the vessels are safe with the exception of one, which wa.? w re' ked on the shore when Amund>< n left Herschel Isiand, October 1!4. There are twelve of the American whaiera In all caught in the ice. The tr p from Ht-r.diel to Eagle City was made up the Mackenzie river to the Pee! river and over the divide to Port Eg bert, through an entirely uninhabited coun try and .t section that is practically unex plored. Capt. Amundsen, who sot out in a small craft with a crew of hut eight men, found the north magnetic po'e, whose discovery Is origin illy accr. d ted to Ross, in 18.'!1. al though scientists doubt that Ross really located this elusive guide to the compasses of th> world. The north magnetic pole has bren gen erally assumed by geographers as being In Bothnia, the most northerly peninsula of t!>?? American continent and close to King William's Island. It Is supposed to be a shifting sphere of influence, though Its V i r.at Ions are not great. Having gone from Greenland to a point In th> vicinity of Herschel Island. It would seem as though Amundsen has at list found the northwest passage for wHich arctic explorers hive bten searching for years. AFFAIRS IN GUAM.
