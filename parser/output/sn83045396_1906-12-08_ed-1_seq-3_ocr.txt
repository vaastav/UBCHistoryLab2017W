NEW TREATY WITH JAPAN IS PROPOSED California Offers Suggestion to Settle Trouble Over the School Question. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7. Califor nia proposes a settlement of the im broglio with Japan over the San Fran cisco school question on the following grounds: Tho Federal Government to enact a new treatv with Japan, excluding Jap anese coolie labor from the United States and Hawaii and American labor from Japan. Japanese contract labor importations to cease. Equality in public schools, with sep arate schools for adult Japanese desir ing primary and grammar school train ing. A decision by the United States Su preme court on the State 's right to pass anti-misccgonation and school laws. The Federal Government to decide the right of franchise for the Japanese, California suggesting' only Federal cog nizance of Japanese class distinctions in passing the law. Keep the question out of the bauds of Congress. California, although still frothing over President Roosevelt's message to Congress, has begun to quiet down and study the possible motives behind the utterances of the chief executive. That the President really meant what he said is considered absurd, and while part of the people still bitterly declare he was misled, others' declare that the message is part of a big diplomatic game and that the President; slapped California mereb- to gain a deplomatic advantage by conciliating Japan. Public men here, probably advised from Washington, are firm in the con viction that President Roosevelt and the Japanese Embassador are framing a new treaty" which shall exclude the Jap anese coo'lie class from tho United States and American labor from Japan.
