S WILSON Cosflniied from Firtt l(ige. I with adh sentence, white an irritating smile spread over the faces on the Re publican side of the stale. The President's suggestion of a tax on pig Iron and fabricated Iron and steel came In for more general criticism ' than any other feature of the message, with the posalbte exception of his re iteration of a recommendation for tne i McAdoo ship purchase legislation, i The Democratic leaders In ths House are st odds with the President on this ! question, and there Is little likelihood l that any tax on Iron and steel can be ! But through Congress. The Republicans will oppose this almost unanimously, and there are many Democrats from Iron and ateel producing dletrtcte who will not consider It for a minute. The chief objection raised to these suggested taxes is that they constitute tax en Industry ana Tne ianor em ployed In that Industry. Republicans insisted tnit ins rres ident had proposed this tax as a sub stitute for a tax on war munitions, and that It was Intended partly to onset the harsh criticism contained In his mea- uige In regard to Americans of foreign pa rentage.

They contend that it will ne a narusnip on me larniir who now usee gasolene to a considerable extent In proarcutlng his business.

In this cnneoJon the Interesting rumor was circulated in Washington, to night that the President ihad told mem bers of Corefress that lie feared that sooner or later he United States or the Americas would have to fight in defence of the Monroe Dootrine. Some color Is lent to this eia'.ernent by toe fact that the President makes It clear In his mee aage that preparnc'nees for t-r.e enforce ment of thla doctrine la one of the ahlet considerations that are moving him In hie national defenos programme at the present time.

Ths President's recommendaton for the appointment of a Joint commission to Investigate the en'lre question of rate regulation with a view to aiding the rail roads will undoubtedly be favorably acted on by Congress.
