Over a Million Copies of Hub bard's Essay Circulated. DEMA5D I0E 250,000 MOEE MADE. tieors H. Dawlela Larsrely Responsi ble Fr tbe Remarkable Dernsad For tbe Article Xerly 1 ,000,000 Copies Have Been Circulated by III ni Alone Text of "Message."' With the beginning of tbe new year more than 150,000 copies of Elbert Hubbard's pamphlet A Message to j Garcia" will bare been issued. It is estimated that 7.500,000 copies of tbe essay have been reprinted in various forms. This, taking into consideration tbe fbort time that lms elapsed since the little book was printed tirst, is un doubtedly the most remarkable record that has ever been made by any pub lication. Elbert Hubbard, who wrote "A Message to Garcia," wrote It without any idea of tbe possibilities for wide circulation of tbe sermon it contained. He is tbe editor of The Philistine Magazine, a small "period teal of protest." published at East Au rora, Erie county. N. 1. He conducts a printing shop and a fine bookbindery in the name of tbe Society of tbe Philis tines, of which he is himself tbe prin clpal and pervading member. He wrote "A Message to Garcia" for last March's number of The Philistine. His attention had been attracted to tbe act of Lieutenant Andrew S. Rowan In delivering a message from the president to General Garcia early in the (Spanish war and thereby keep ing some 20.000 Spanish troops out of Santiago until the United States army and navy had taken the city. He made the incident tbe text of a homily on prompt aud intelligent service of em ployees. The great Interest taken in the "mes sage" and the wonderful demand for it are due largely to the work of George II. Daniels, tbe general passenger agent of the New York Central and Hudson River railroad. As be was sitting In bis oHice at tbe Grand Cen tral station one day looking over Tbe Philistine his eye caught "A Mes sage to Garcia." and it struck him that the sermon contained there applied with particular force to railroad em ployees, says the New York Sun. He made arrangements with Mr. Hub bard to print off some copies. Four thousand were printed. Then Mr. Dan iels obtained leave for himself from Mr. Hubbard to print "A Message to Garcia." This was done, and 500,000 copies were issued in editlous of 100,- OOO each. Hut it has become manifest to bim that 100.000 editions are too Blow, and there is now in preparation an edition of &00.0O0. More than 1,000,- 000 copies of the essay have been cir culated, as tbe demand for it has come from many sources. Iiesides the 1.000,- 000 copies printed by Mr. Daniels. Hub bard has printed 2."jO,000 at tbe Roy- croft shop to till orders that have come there for the book in numbers from 1 to 1.000. The following Is "A Mes sage to Garcia:" In all this Cubau business there is one man stands out on the horizon of my memory like Mars at perihelion. When war broke out between Spain aud the United States, it was very necessary to communicate quickly with the leader of the Insurgents. Garcia was somewhere in the moun tain fastnesses of Cuba no one knew where. No mall or telegraph mes sage could reach him. The president must secure his co-operation, and quickly. What to do! Some one said to the president. There's a fellow by the name of Rowan will find Garcia for you, if any body can." Howan was sent for and given a letter to be delivered to Garcia. How "the fellow by the name of Rowan" took the letter, sealed it up in an oil skin pouch, strapped it over his heart. in four days landed by night off the coast of Culra from an open boat dis appeared Into the jungle and in three weeks came out on the other side of the island, having traversed a hostile country on foot and delivered bis let ter to Garcia, are things I have no special desire now to tell in detail. Tbe point I wish to make is this: Mc- Kinley gave Rowan a letter to be deliv ered to Garcia, llowan took the letter nnd did not ask, "Where is he at?" By the Eternal, there is a man whose form should be cast in deathless bronze and the statue placed In every college of he land! It is not book learning young men need nor instruction auout tnis and that, but a stiffening of the verte- ( brie which will cause them to le loyal to a trust, to act promptly, concentrate tfcelr energies, do the thing "carry a message to Garcia!" General Garcia is dead now, but there are other Garcias. No man who has endeavored to carry out an enterprise where many hands were needed but has been well nigh ap palled at times by the Imbecility of the average man the Inability or unwill ingness to concentrate on a thing and do it. Slipshod assistance, foolish Inat tention, dowdy indifference and half hearted work seem the rule.and no man uccecds unless by book or crook or threat he forces or bribes other men to ssist him. or mayhap God. in his good- LS3, performs a miracle and sends bim n angel of light for an assistant. You. ender. put this matter to a test: Y'ou re sitting now In your office; six clerks are within call. Summon any one and make this request. "Please look In the encyclopedia and make a brief memorandum for me concerning the life of Correggio." Will the clerk quietly say. "Yes, sir." and go to the task? On your life, be will not. He will II look at you out of a fishy eye and ask rice or more of tbe following questions: Who was he? Which encyclopedia? Where is tbe encyclopedia 7 J, ua 1 Uiiru Aft iiiu, . Don't you mean Bismarck? What's the matter with Charlie do ing it? Is be dead? Is there any hnrry? Shan't I bring you the book and let you look it up yourself? What do you want to know for? And I will lay you 10 to 1 that after yoft have answered tbe questions and explained how to find tbe information and why you want it the clerk will go off and get one of the other clerks to help him try to find Garcia and then come back and tell you there Is no such man. Of course I may lose my bet: but, according to the law of average, 1 will not. Now. if you are wise you will not bother to explain to your "assistant that Correggio is indexed under the C's, not in the K's, but you will smile sweetly and say, "Never mind," and go look it up yourself. And his Incapacity for independent action, this moral stupidity, this in firmity of the will, this unwillingness to cheerfully catch bold and lift, are tbe things that put pnre socialism so far into tbe future. If men will not act for themselves, what will they do when the benefit of their effort is for all? A first mate with knotted club seems necessary, and the dread of get ting "the bounce" Saturday night holds many a worker to his place. Advertise for a stenographer, and nine out of ten who apply can neither spell nor punctuate and do not think it necessary to. Can such a one write a letter to Gar cia? "You see that bookkeeper?" said the foreman to me in a large factory. "Yes; what about bim?" "Well, he's a fine accountant, but if I'd send bim up town on an errand he might accomplish tbe errand all right, and, on the other band, might stop at four 6aloons on tbe way, and when he got to Main street would for- .get what he had been sent for." Can such a man be intrusted to car ry a message to Garcia? We have recently been bearing much maudlin sympathy expressed for the "downtrodden denizen of the sweat shop" and the "homeless wanderer searching for honest employment,' and with it all often go many bard words for the men in power. Nothing is said about the employer who grows old before bis time in a vain attempt to get frowsy ne'er do wells to do intelligent work and bis long, patient striving with "help" that does nothing but loaf when bis back Is turned. In every store and factory there Is a constant weeding out proc ess goiug on. The employer is con stantly sending away "help" that has shown their Incapacity to further tb,e Interests of the business, and others are being taken on. No matter - bow good times are, this sorting continues. only If times are bard and work is scarce the sorting is done finer, but out and forever out the Incompetent and unworthy go. It is the survival of the fittest. Self interest prompts every employer to keep the best those who can carry a message to Garcia. I kuow one man of really brilliant parts who has not the ability to man age a business of his own, and yet who Is absolutely worthless to any one else, because he carries with him constantly the insane suspicion that bis employer is oppressing, or Intend ing to oppress, bim. He cannot give orders, and be will not receive them. Should a message be given to bim to take to Garcia, his answer would prob ably be. "Take it yourself." Tonight this man walks the streets looking for work, the wind whistling through his threadbare coat. No one who knows bim dare employ him. for he is a regular firebrand of discontent. He Is impervious to reason, and the only thing that can Impress bim is the toe of a thick soled Xo. 9 boot. Of course I know that one so morally de formed Is no less to be pitied than a physical cripple, but In our pitying let us drop a tear, too, for tbe men who are striving to carry on a great enter prise, whose working hours are not limited by the whistle and whose hair is fast turning white through the strug gle to hold in line dowdy indifference. slipshod imbecility and the heartless Ingratitude which but for their enter prise would be hungry and homeless. Have I put the matter too strongly? Possibly I have, but when all the world has gone a-slumming I wish to speak word of sympathy for the man who succeeds tbe man who against great odds has directed the efforts of others and.' having succeeded, finds there's nothing in it nothing but bare board and clothes. I have carried a dinner pail and worked for day's wages, and I have also been an employer of labor. and I know there is something to be . said on both sides. There is no excel- ' lence per se in poverty; rags are no recommendation, and all employers are not rapacious and high banded any more than all poor men are virtuous. . My heart goes out to tbe man who does bis work when the "boss" is away as well as when be is at borne. and the man who. when given a letter for Garcia, quietly takes the missive without asking any idiotic questions and with no lurking intention of chuck ing it Into the nearest sewer or of doing aught else but deliver It. never gets "laid off" nor has to go on a strike for higher wages. Civilization Is one long, anxious search for just such indi viduals. Anything such a man asks shall be granted. His kind is so rare that no employer can afford to let him go. He Is wanted In every city, town and village. In every office, shop, store and factory. The world cries out for Fuch. He is needed, and needed badly tbe man who can carry a message to Garcia. 

ADVANCES IN FARMING. Varied and Useful Work of the Agricultural Department. FOEEIQN PETIITS GBOWN HERE. fmyraa Flgrs Introduced on Pacific Coast WltU Marked Snecesa Trop ical Products Now Importea Which Can Be Raised la Oar New Posses sions In trodact ion of Xew Plants. The annual report of Secretary Wil son summarizes an immense amount of valuable work done by tbe agricul tural department in Washington dur ing the past year. He comments par ticularly on tbe successful extension of the weather bureau service around the Caribbean sea, giving timely storm warnings to tbe vessels of the navy and merchant marine, says the Phila delphia Public Ledger. The division of entomology has done valuable work this year In showing fruit growers on the Pacific coast the proper method of fertilizing Smyrna figs. It is believed that in a few years the Pacific coast will be able to produce as fine figs as are now imported from tbe Mediterranean. Tbe department has gathered much information regarding the plants which supply India rubber and gutta percha and expects, during the coming year. to locate in our island possessions zones suitable for the culture of these plants. The United States now in ports about $30,000,000 worth of rub ber annually, and it is thought that a large proportion of this supply can be raised in our new island possessions. The same is true of Egyptian cotton, of which we import $5,000,000 worth annually, while he thinks that $200, 000,000 worth of tropical products which we now import each year can all be raised in Porto Rico, Hawaii and tbe Philippines. Much work has been done in the hybridizing of grains to secure varie ties which will resist drought, rust and cold. The same methods are be ing used to produce hardy orange trees and sea Island cotton, which will be immune to the fungus disease now attacking that staple. Practical forestry work Is being done on a large scale among the lumbermeu of several states. Irrigation work In tbe west has been carried on. and much alkali land has been reclaimed. The secretary's recom mendations in this line include irriga tion experiments in the east nnd south outside of the arid region. He thinks that congressional action also may be necessary in the west on this subject of water rights and reservoir rights. The experiment station work of the department has been extended to Alas ka and should be extended to Hawaii, Porto Rico and the Philippines, so that they may "be enabled to supply the United States with the tropical prod ucts of which our importations are now $200,000,000 annually. Extensive experiments are being car ried on in road construction, in co operation with the local authorities of the several states, iucluding the build ing of sample roads from the mate rials found in different localities and the laying of steel track wagou roads. The third year of experimentation with hog cholera shows that from 75 to 80 per cent of the hogs injected with serum are saved. The secretary strongly recommends a more rigid inspection of our export dairy products to counteract the Injury tlmt lias been dono to the trado bv un scrupulous dealers in thQSast. Regarding seed distribution, the sec retary says that there Is no need for the department to come Into competi tion with the sales of seedsmen, but that there is room for valuable work in the collection and distribution of such foreign seeds nnd plants as are adapted to the United States, but would not be secured by private enter prise. Tea growing experiments In South Carolina are commended, and he notes that 3,000 pounds of good tea were raised in the gardens at Summerville in tbe last season. Turkestan alfalfa, Introduced by the department, has been found a valuable forage plant iu the northwest for re sisting both cold and drought. Its intro duction, it is said, probably will add millions of dollars to the annual hay product of the -country. A valuable quality of rice has been introduced from Japan. It is superior to the domestic product, and should it succeed In Louisiana hundreds of thou sands of dollars will be added yearly to the rice growing Industry. The sec retary asks for $10,000 to prosecute a technical and scientific investigation of native drug plants in co-operation with the Pan-American congress. A Toagk, Toatk Flab. Fish sesvn to have no sense of feel ing, and many people believe that the angry and energetic movements of a fish when It is caught are due rather to annoyance at losing Its liberty than to any sense of pain. I can confirm this, because I have over and over again taken an undersized pike that has been once or twice caught and put back into the water. Upon one occasion three of us boys of tbe Old brigade were fishing in a small pool in a narrow, sluggish river. Jones caught a small pike, and as it was undersized, being barely four pounds, be cut tbe books out of its gul let and threw the fish in again. Inside of 30 seconds Jones caught tbe same fish again. Once more be cut out the books, and this time he had to maul it very much. Once more it was kicked in. . Then I caught it. still bleeding. I got tbe books out with difficulty, and be- j fore I could throw the fish in again a terrier dojj. bjt JtlULlttJhr9Mja. JTljtpX kicked the fish In, and Brown taught it. At last we got so tired of catching this fish that I threw it away in dis gust. It caught in the fork of a willow tree and staid there for half an bour, when a crow attacked it. dislodging it from the tree, but not before it had re moved one of the eyes. The selfsame fish was caught next day by the keep er. Fishing Gazette. Pride of tbe Poor. Mrs. Clarence Burns, who is so well known for her philanthropic work. says that in all her experience in visit ing the- tenements of the poor of the city she has never been asked for alms, Mrs. Burns has made a business of vis iting the poor with the hope of helping them whenever she saw the need, but finds it almost Impossible to make the really deserving poor acknowledge that they are in need of anything. One day she vifited a family who were all huddled together in one bare, cold room, ana their races were so pinched she knew they were starving. But in response to her offer to help them the mother said: "No, thank you. The children have had something today. I am sure to get work soon." After questioning as to just exactly what the children had had to eat Mrs. Burns found that they had subsisted for three days on a few dried scraps of stale bread. This experience, she says, is repeated freqdcntly. New York Tribune. Sbe Hadn't Dropped Off. "Delia!" 'Yis, ma'am." "I am very tired, and I am going to He down for an hour." "Yis. ma'am."

She is awakened by the clock striking 0 aud cries indig nantly: "Delia!" "Yis, ma'am." "Why didn't you call me at 3 o'clock. as I told you to do?"
