Elsewhere in this issue is presented a sucoint review of President McKinley's message to congress, which should be carefully read by everyone who desires to keep posted on the affairs of the country. The chief interest in the doc. ument at this time centers in the Phil ippine question. The president treats of it fully in his message and, while he leaves it to congress to specify the form of government for the islands, he con elusively proves thut the United States could not-with honor to herself or jus tice to the Filipinos-have pursued any other course than that which has been followed. This is proven by a review of the con ditions in the islands prior to the begin ning of the war, and by reference to the report of the peace commission. The message proves what every honest man who has kept track of the Philip pine question already knows-that the fighting was forced upon our army; that only a small per cent of the natives have been engaged in it; that most of them are loyal to the United States; that from the moment Admiral Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet, the presi dent directed him, and later the mili tary autohrities, to inform the Filipi nos that we came not as invaders and conquerers, but as friends of the na tives, to protect them in their homes, in their personal, political and religious rights. All these facts are so clearly set forth by the president that the rn tire Philippine situltion is made plain; those who do not understand it can get a clear comprehension of the subject by reading the message. The president, ,of course, declares that the soverignty of the United States must be recogniz ed and maintained in the islands, and suggests no thought that they will be surrendered. The next most important subject treated in the message is the trusts. The president agrees with ex-President Harrison that, when trusts are organiz ed to suppress natural and ordinary competition and unduly enhance the price of articles to the general con sumer, they are dangerous conspiracies and should be made the subject of pro hibitory and even penal legislation. The federal law enacted against trusts in 1890 is referred to by the president, who recommends congress to supple mnent it with an effecitve code of state legislation, so that the people may be protected from the unlawful and injur ious combinations of capital. The lan guage of the message on the trust ques tion rings clear and true and the dem ocrats will find it difficult, in the face of the president's words, to make the people believe that his administration is protecting the trusts. The president urges the importance of upholding the present gold standard and preserving the coinage of the two metals on a parity with each other, He treats of the conditions in Cuba and Porto Rico, favors the Nicaragua canal and reviews every public question in uech a iconise nanllur that the mLessage imparts a fund of informnition which is invaluable to overy citizen. It is prob. alby the ablest state paper that over came front the white house; it advises remedies by legislation wherever evils exist and dodges nothing. The tnes isage, in fact, is a good platfonm for the republicauu party-because it is for the good of the government and the people. RBead it or you canot be posted no the publio questions of the day. A HIOGUtr BID). Yesterday's issue of the Billings Times contains a column and a half wail because the county commissioners did not award it the county printing r contract, and the Times threatens to S"how up" the commissioners to the public, calls their action an awarding t.hbe contract to The Gazette 'republi Sa usurpation" and says also that "it eps(iher just nor honest." The sim taots in the case are that the editor T'mes, coached by a discredited republican, tried to sub. gdo the commieuioners, ior hbe purpose of en. % mtake .potl. oal capital .ti im." es editor was h l;bardb-arud admit. M be woueld u the same action if he was a commis siouer-that they Were going to award the contract to The Gazette at 25 per cent less than statute rates, Then he hastened from the court house and pre pared a bogus bid, returning with it in 30 minutes, according to his own state ment, after be knew the contract had been awarded to this newspaper. Very properly, the commissioners re fused to receive his starvation bid, which was 70 per cent less than statute rates for publications, 50 per cent less for blank books and 40 per cent less for legal blanks. The law does not require the aommissioners to receive bids, nor to let the contract to the lowest bidder if bids are presented; it authorizes them to award the contract to the newspaper which, in their judgment, is best qualified to perform the work. In this county, that newspaper is The Ga zette, which fact is recognized by every one-democrats as well as republicans. Tihe Times, bid was a bogus bid and never would have been made had its editor not known that the contract had already been awarded to this newspa per. For the past year The Gazette has had the contract at much better figures than those offered by the Times, uand has not made anything on the county work. The Times would have lost muoey if it had been given the con. tract, and the taxpayels will sustain tl e commnissioners in making aln award at living rates, as they had' a perfect legal and moral right to do. That is the Montana way at doing things; Arkansaw methods do not pre vail in the northwest, where a laborer is worthy of his hire, and Editor Morris should take his medicine like nt man and pretend he likes it, anyhow. The Times will only make itself more ridic ulous than it is by censuring gentlemen of such probity of character as the county commissioners. The people will hardly believe, on testimony furnished from such a source as the Tinies, that old and respected residents of this county would be guilty of a dishonora ble action. Our contemporaiy will first have to get into their class before its strictures will havre any effect. Tile Times and its co-conspirator have been guilty of a dirty and contemptible trick in trying to besmirch the official char acter of the county commissioners. But the Times has no standing in this community, even with its own party, and the only way it could cast suspicion on the commissioners would be by com mending their action. S By the death of Senator Hayward oi Nebraska, it is thought possible that W. J. Bryan may be appointed United t States senator to fl the vacancy. Mr. Bryan had better take the job If he can get it; he'll never get that close to the white house as a candidate for presi. dent. In its column and a half wail about not receiving the county printing conu tract on its Chinaman's bid, the esteem. ed Billings Times fails to state that its - editor informed the commissioners that hle would do just as they did if lie was in their place-give it to The Gazette. The esteemed Billings Timts is in formed that the county commissioners let the printing contract togThe Gazette because it is a newspaper of general cir oulation. Purchase your holiday goods of the merchants who advertise in The Ga. zette, and you'll get the best goods. A
