VERDICT. The verdict rendered by the jar' or the federal court in Greensboro In the Nick Williams indictment Is causingl comment In the press. The Nick Wil liams Company is -a corporation. N. Glenn Williams arid ED. Kennedy are its principal officers. They and the. company were charged In a bill ecn-j talnln? fifteen counts with defrauding the government. Ten of the counts were withdrawn and the jury passed upon the other five. The jury return ed not guilty as to all the defendants on four of these- counts and on the fifth It found that the corporation was gnilty of defrauding tho government; but that the individual defendants were not guilty. The trauds.if committed, were neces sarily the work of some person con nected with the company. The cor poration, having no personality, cxila not commit sltl actual crime. Any wrongful act done In its name or in the course of -the transaction of Its i business, must necessarily have boen the work of &cme individual connect ed with that corporation. Hence we- cannot see Tiow there could be a vio lation of a criminal statute by this eor-l poration without some one of its jzrsm hers or officers being guilty of having' done the forbidden deed. Under the finding of this jury ta bank official might steal all the funds -deposited with the bank by its custom -rs anrl on an indictment including the corporation with the guilty official for criminal mismanagement and embes zlement. the jury might find the in dividual not guilty and still declare the corporation ;guilty. This woulJ 'hardly be a .greater straining of the law than was hat resorted to by the jury in the .Nick '.Williams case. -The Norfolk Landmark in discussing the Nick Williams verdict says that lit was the "".natural , consequence of the :peniicious .precedent established by -the President" in preventing the pros cution of Paul Morton for violation of the law against discrimination in ;rwiLway freight rates when vice pres- :Fe railrdrtd. II will be remembered :that Mr. Roosevelt . held in substaaa.ee that "here was no : evidence that the railway rate .law was violated, by Mr. Morton butonly by the corpora tion of which he was general manager. Of says: these two cases the Landmark This makes it impossible to do any-; thins: more than fine ihe corporation1 o,000 and the costs Of the action. The Sawyers for the defence jnade the point immediately after the verdict was ren dered, that a corporation, being: im personal, could not 'have intent, ami that therefore the judgment of crime asrainutt the Oha 'Nick Company is null contention, bwt from the lay -point ofj view there is a great deal of sound ense in the argument that it is im-l possible for a corporation to be eruiltyj while all its officers are innocent. How ever, ff the president was right in the iMorton case, the Greensboro .iury is rfcrht in the Nick Williams -case : and if! that is so. the big corporations will go atvead violating the taws while thev la,js:h m their sleeves -at-the Jittle fines assessed against them after tedious and cost- prosecution by tho govern ment. 

THAT RAILWAY KXTE ?iANK. In Tuesday morning-s .News and Observer we find the following in the editonnl department, lieferepce of coui-se is to the matter of federal con trol of interstate railway rates- The railroad organs are greatly dis appointed because Mr. John Sharpe Williams didn't iump off the -demo cratic platform because Mr. Roosevelt' determined to stand for its soundest plank. Mr. Williams doesn't leave , own home because another -asks kave to warrt hv his fire and brings some wood to help make it rightly. In The Evening Times of Itiale&h i the same day we find the following -paragraph in an editorial comment on president IJocisevelts message to con-' ,gl?ss: -The rate bill w&s hatched in the cor-H runt republican breast. It is a republi can measure, a hair-splitting roject terribly exaggerated until there are people who believe that the railroads have been sucking Uie very life bipod of the shippers. Its. enactment into a a law will not increase the size of thej loaf. It will not give more meat to the hungry, and it will help none of us for that tariff robbery is the law that takes bread from starving American citizens. ' If the bill ever passes it will be with the aid of democratic votes democrats will help to make Theodore .Roosevelt the mighty dictator. Just as Tner w. 1 lurn tne government over tO( i t-.i'.uuuvauM i.r an ume. uniess. uer traps, the thing' shall react and rebotmdj aaid crush the party which bas fought for it. Its passage will mean that Theodore Roosevelt will be the next president of the United States by the! grace of democratic votes, or that he will be the mest unpopular statesman on American soil. When such geod and ably edited democratic papers as these differ so widely and so emphatically what must the ordinary man in the ranks do who looks to these pa pers for guidance? How can he form an opinion as to what his party should do? He mut be in doubt whether this railway rate contest, which was advocated by his party long before adopted by the republi cans, has become a corrupt matter, not lit any longer to be touched by a demo crat since Mr. Rooseveit has endorsed the proposition, or whether he shall eontinuo to stand on this plank of his platform considering it as'sound as ever notwithstanding the fact that the republican president is try ing to climb upoBlt. 'r- ' ; : For ourselves, we cannot see why it i not as good democratic doctrine since the delivery of the president's message as it was on the day it vras promulgated in a democratic national convention as one' of the principles of that party. Wonder what Mr. Jose phus Daniels, and Mr. John Sharp Williams have to say about this prin ciple being "hatched in the corrupt republican breast."
