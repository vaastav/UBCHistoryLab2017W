Indications are cropping out that the Japanese who have been arriving here for some time past, alj well as those who have been granted passports and who will arrive In the future, are picked men with military experience. London, Dec 4. The Daily Mail publishes lin an editorial this morning on the difficulties of the United States with Japan over the school question in San Francises. The paper is of the opinion that in spite of the gravity of the situation, "owing to the fact that President Roiisevelt has not power to coerce California, It Is foolish to suggest that Japan would enforce her rights at the cannon's mouth. Japan certainly has no intention of picking a quarrel with the United States, the paper says.' America has ibeen her firm friend In the past, her rulers wlill be able to make large allowances for the difficulties of America and as President Roosevelt is certain to meet Japan's requests in a fair and kindly spirit, tho incident will pass and be forgotten.
