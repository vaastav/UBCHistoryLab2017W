V. U.S.TROOPS TO GUARD MINERS Six Hundred Regular Army Men Will Protect Volunteer Workers In Kansas. DRASTIC ACTION IS DUE Nation Shivers as Coal Situation Grows More Desperate—Many Mines Ready To Open, Await ing Return of Workers. Washington, Dec. 1.—The pinch of the coal shortage promises to force the adoption of drastic measures to avert an actual famine. A vacation of one month by soft coal miners has brought on conditions like those pre vailing during the war, in many sec tions, but wartime restrictions have not altogether checked the drain on coal piles. Not much hope is held out by of ficials for early production of bitumi nous coal in quantities sufficient to permit the maintenance of the present slim reserve, under supervision of the Railroad administration's central coal committee. The latest authentic fig ures show that last week's soft coal output did not reach 50 per cent of normal production. This meant, of ficials explained, that local needs must be met from the supplies being dis tributed through the central commit tee, whose stocks aggregated about 22,000,000 tons when the miners quit work. Mines Ready To Open. Chicago, Dec. 1.—Mines in many states were ready to re-open on the basis of the 14 per cent wage advance fixed by Fuel Administrator Gareld, but the anticipated refusal of many union miners to break their strike now one month old left the prospect for Increased production an unans wered question. But with nearly the whole of the country under fuel restriction more stringent than in war time, many gov ernors were considering taking some drastic action similar to that of Gov ernor Allen of Kansas who took over control of the strip mines under court receiverships and who has federal troops at the mines and 1,200 national guardsmen on the way to protect volunteer workers. Kansas cities were appealing for troops because of tlje strike of switch-, men and trainmen in the Kansas City terminal district. There was a pos sibility that state troops might be called out. Bad Situation at St. Joseph. St. Joseph, Mo., Dec. 1.—With only three carloads of coal in the railroad yards here and fuel oil practically un obtainable, St. Joseph faces a fuel and water famine which will force the closing of the light and power plant, the waiter plant and big industries of the city. A mass meeting of citizens has been called. 

GOVERNORS URGE ACTION. Hold Conference Looking To Produc tion of Coal.

SPECIAL SESSION HIS ALL BILLS IN Time Limit on Introduction of Measures Finds "Hopper" Contains 107. SOLONS DOWN TO WORK Free Rein in Introduction of Bills Does Not Mean That All Will Receive Session's Time Steering Committee Being Used. Bismarck, N. D.—When the agreed time limit for the introduction of bills had elapsed Saturday afternoon, the extraordinary session of the Sixteenth legislative assembly, now convened here, found Itself confronted with an array of proposed measures covering nearly every imaginable subject and aggregating a total of 107. The num ber is considered sufficient—even sur prising—when it is reflected that the present session is designed to last only ten days or thereabouts and was called for the purpose of considering only a few measures which the administra tion held needed attention of the law making body at this time. Among the subjects proposed for consideration by Governor Frazier were: A law constituting the railroad com mission a body to investigate and ex pose profiteering. The ratification of the woman suf frage amendment to the federal con stitution. Extension of county feed and seed loans and the further issuance of seed and feed bonds by counties to handle more loans where crop conditions have been adverse. Provision for semi-annual tax pay ments on real estate, making one-half delinquent March 1, and the other half the following November 15. Authorization of a bond issue to finance the home builders' association. Broadening the scope of the soldiers' compensation law, and providing for quicker payment of allotments. Repeal of the moneys and credits tax. An appropriation to meet the state's share of the construction cost of a bridge across the Missouri river at Bismarck. Governor's Program to Have Attention AH of the foregoing subjects, it Is believed, have come under the wire among the numerous others introduced last week, -and these will naturally have' attention, whatever befalls in dividual measures which may be lack ing the sanction of the administration or the league. In fact, in order to clear the work of the session at all within the contemplated limit of time for its work, it will be necessary to adopt means which will center the at tention of the law makers largely upon the subjects upon which the ad ministratioii, or at least, the majority of members^ are pretty thoroughly agreed. To this end, it is understood that all b/lls will go through the hands of a ''steering committee" which will submit for.'attention only those which its leaders approve. By this means, It seemed possible, at the first of the week, that the plan of an early ad journment might "be realized, yInvestigations"^,Widely Proposed -jOne o£ the features expected in the governors messagS/and on$:vyhich did not fail to be incorporated„ln it, was a proposal for the naming of a legisla tive committee of five members to look Into certain alleged unlawful acts and expenditures Of st'&te official^ who have fallen Tinder the ban for non conformity: with the wishes of Non partisan leaders, or, as It Is said, with the wishes of the league. Measures were Introduced looking to this end, and, In fact, other measures were pro« posed—as usually results in such in stances—for the investigation of other departments of the state administra tion and about everything else In sight. Many of these will probably receive no attention at this time, either through shortage of time or through the prevailing sentiment, of those who are directing the session's work. As an instance of the divergent spirits working in the session It may be noted that following the Introduction of measures embodying the governor's Investigation plans, a retaliatory meas ure was proposed In the senate, call ing for a committee to investigate the charge that J. W. Brinton, formerly connected with the organization of league newspapers, had made $62,000 out of the operation of the official newspaper law, of which he was the chief sponsor at the regular session last winter. A law providing that counties might issue .bonds for the purchase of dairy stock for farmers, upon the petition of 50 freeholders, Is one of the measures introduced. It is claimed to have con siderable support from farmers in the western part of the state. Among the so-called '"punitive" legis lation introduced for the purpose of disciplining certain state officials or limiting their powers are bills designed to reduce the appropriations available for their respective, departments, and In the instance of the attorney gen eral's office, at least, to provide for the appointment of assistants attorney general, by th^-governor arid, placing •^at his'! disposal an appropriation of 425,000 to defray the salaries and ex penses of such appointees. Associate Justice Robinson ad dressed the session with suggestions that the taxes be greatly decreased.
