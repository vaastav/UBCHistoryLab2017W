From Our (hen Correspondent. WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 0, 18!>9. The important events of tho week in Congress have boen the reading: of fhn annual message of the President, and tho action of tho House upon the cre dentials of Roberts, the polygamist from Utah. Thc general comments heard upon tho executive communication are any thing but flattering to its author, lt is enormously long, coutaiuiug more words than any previous annual mes sage to Congress. Hut its laugunge is dubious, lacking in force; and upon the important issues of the day? it falls far short of expectations, lt leaves the Philippine question in tho air; and it is apparent now that the President will not venture to put himself square ly on record, officially, ? in regard to this matter, prior to tho national elec tions. His utterances to Congress are remarkably short of his speeches in the west, on his famous avound-the-circ!o trip befox? tho Ohio election. He now ventures nothing upon the imperialistic issue, beyond a statement, which no one disputes or has denied, that the insurrection must bc ended, nnd that obligations incurred in the war with Spain for establishing order in terri tory acquired by this country, muet be fulfilled. Hut upon the important question as to how this government snail govern the Asiatic possessions, what measure of liberty shall be given the Filipinos, the President is silent. His evasion of the issue is taken gen erally to mean that ho is doubtful now himself about the American people's endorsement of the policy to hold per-, inanently all tho Philippines ami to' ffovern them by a colonial system sinii ar to that of Great Britain. Tho financial suggestions of Mr. Mc Kinley have chilled the western lle fmblicans, who cherished the hope that ie would, nominally at least, adhere to tho Republican platform of 1890 upon which ho was elected, favoring larger uso of silver, to be brought about by international agreement. Intelligent men have understood fully that this declaration was put in merely to pro pitiate certain sections like Indiana and Illinois where silver coinage is strong, even with Republicans. Now, however, the President conies out squarely for the establishing more firmly of the single gold standard, the increase of national bankers privileges, and authority for the Secretary of the Treaeury to sell United States bonds on long or short time. As the present Secretary exercises his discretion to buy bonds and tura cash into Wall street whenever the speculators are short of money, this new proposition implies a moro flexible arrangement by which the Treasury will lend itself to the adjustment of rates to stock speculators at their behest, or as the whim may strike him, and both sell and buy bonds for the purpose. The trust question is treated with little short ot misstatement of. law and facts. The day prior to the reading of this message the United States Supremo Court, in the important case of the Addyston Pipe Co., decided that this trust was in violation of Federal sta tutes. There is no longer doubt that existing law is sufficient to reach the trusts. Histor the Attorney-General of the United States, an official of McKinley's administration, to prosecute the offenders. But Attorney-General Griggs comes from New Jersey, tho great incorporating State of all the trusts operating in the country, and his thoughts and convictions are im bued naturally with prejudices in favor of the great capitalistic concerns. Griggs can not see means for prosecu ting these combinations under the so called Sherman act, although the Su premo Court can convict when cases aro brought before it. Tho easiest es cape from such a situation is to ask for more legislation, and this is tho course of tho President. With laws enough to cover tho principal offenders, the trust-fed administration asks Congress to furnish more; and then ifi implies these matters will receive considera tion. When the next Republican con vention meets, it will no doubt de nounce vigorously, in general terms, trnstsand combinations for the purpose of stilling competition. The Republi cans have lost none of their character istic effrontery, as is shown very well in the latest message of their chief re presentativo. No suggestion is made for lessening the burdens of the standing army, but, on the contrary, between the lines can be read the purpose to establish it permanently. If tho President actual ly believes the insurrection in the Philippines is practically ended, why is no hope extended that soon the army can bo reduced, and n portion at least of the present burden of ?120,000,000 tor this army can be taken off the shoulders of the tax-payers ? In the House the message was listen ed to impatiently. The thousands who filled the galleries were there to witness the proceedings in the Roberts case. They were bored by the long, tedious message. Without party division, the House voted not to admit Roberts on his un questionably perfect certificate of elec tion as a Representative. Tho com ments heard from thc leaders cn both sides indicate very clearly that they were not at all satisfied witli their votes upon the question. They re cognize, unanimously, thata most dan gerous precedent has been established in* refusing to admit any man present ing regular credentials, a precedent that may be invoked hereafter to great injury of a State, by unscrupulous ma jorities in the House. It can be stated, moreover, that there were not six men of the nearly 400 in the House who did not recognize the fact that the proper procedure in the case would havo been to adopt the resolution offered by the Democratic leader. Mr. Richardson, proposing to admit Roberts temporari ly upon his credeuuais, and then refer to the committee on the judiciary for immediate report ttie charges of per sonal disqualification. Roberts would nave been expelled under that method, beyond tho shadow of a doubt. S. Deafness Cannot be Cured hy local applications, as they can not reach the disca-jod portion cf the ear.
