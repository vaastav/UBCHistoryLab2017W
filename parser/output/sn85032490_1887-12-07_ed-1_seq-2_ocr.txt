The necessity of combi nation to maintain the price ot any com modity to the tariff point, furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity and that such prices arc remunerative, and lower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus, where either of these exist, a case would seem to be presented for an easv reduction of taxation." The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws, are in tended only to enforce an earnest recom mendation that the surplus revenues of the government be prevented by the re duction of our customs duties, and, at the .same time to emphasize a suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose, we may discharge a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources which it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Korean the presentation made of such consideration be, with any degree of fairness, regarded as evidences of un friendliness toward any of our manufac turing interests or any lack of apprecia tion of their value and importance. These interests constitute a leading and most substantial element of our national greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress, but if in the emer gency that presses us on o ur manufact urers are asked to surrender something for the public good and to avert dis aster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of the ad vantages already afforded, should lead them to willingly cooperate. Xo demand is made that the- shall forego all the ben efit f of governmental regaid, but they cannot. fail to be admonished of theirduty, jib well as their enlightened self-interest and .safety, when they are reminded of the fact that a financial panic and collapse, 10 which the present condition tends, affords no greater shelter or protection to our manufacturers than to our other important enterprises Opportunity lor safe, careful aud deliberate reform is now offered, and none of us should be un mindful of the time when an abused and in-elated people, heedless of those who have resisted timely and reasonable changes demanded a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs. The diffi culty attending a wise and fair revision of our tarifl laws is not underestimated. It will require on the part of the congress reat labor and care, and especially a broad and national contemplation of the subject and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasona ble and reckless of the welfare of the en tire country. Under our present laws more than four thousand articles are subject to duty. 3Iany of thc-e do not in any way compete with our manufacturers and many are haidly worth attention as subjects of reve nue. A considerable reduction can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries presents no 'features of hardship, but. the necesiries of life used and consumed b all the peo ple, the duty upon which adu to the cot of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened. The- radical reduction of the duties imposed upon raw material used in manufactures or as iree importation is. of coui-se, an inipoi taut factor in any effort to reduce the price of thev1 necessities. It would not only relieve them from the in creased cot caused by the tariff on such material, but the manufactured product being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such product as a compensation to our manufacturers for the present price of raiw material could be accoulingly modified. Such reduction, or free importation, would serve beside to reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a change can have an injurious effect upon our manufacturers. On the conlary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the many of other countries who cheapen their wares by free material. Tims our people might have th" opportunity of extending their sales bejond the limits of home consumption, saving them from the depression, interruption m business and Joss caused by a glutted domestic .market and affording employes more certain and steady laiborrwith its resulting prosperity and contentmont. The question thus presented for solution should be approached in a spirit higher than partisanship and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those intrusted with the weal of a eonhding people. The obligation to de clared party policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt ami effective action. Both of the great political parties now represented in the gov-rnment. have by rcptatcti aindaiuthoritativjj declarations, condemned the condition of our laws which permits the collection from the people of unnecessary revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised its correc tion, and neither as partisans nor as coun trymen, are in a mood to condone the delib erate violation of thesu pledges. Our pro gress toward a w ise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It is a condition which confronts us, not a theory. The relief from this con dition may involve a slight reduction of the adantage.s which we award our home productions but the entire withdrawal of such advantages should not lie contem plated. The question of free trade is abso lutely irrelevant, and the persistent claim made in certain quarters that all ellorts to .relieve the people from unjust and unnec essary taxation ate schemes of so-called free traders is mischievous and far re moved from any consideration of the pub lic nood. The simple, plain duty we owe the peo ple is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economical operation of the government, and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the treasury through the perversion of government powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our industries, without danger to the oppor tunity for remunerative labor which our worklnginen need aud with benefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of subsistence and increasing the measure of their comforts. The constitution provides that the presi dent shall from time to time give to con gress information of thestate'of the Union. It has been the custom oi the executive, in compliance with this provision, to annually exhibit to the congress at the opening vi its session the general condition ot the country and to detail with some particu larity the operations of the different exe cutive departments. It would be espec ially agreeable to follow this course at the present time, and to call attention to the valuable accomplishments of these departments during the last fiscal year. But I am so much fm pressed with the paramount importance of the subject 10 which tins communication has thus tar been devoted, that I shall forego the addi tion of any other topic, and only urge up on your immediate consideration the state ot the Union, as shown in the present con dition of our treasury and our general fis cal situation, upon which eery element of our safety and prosperity depends. The reports of the heads of departments, which will be submitted to you, contain full and explicit information touching the transaction of business entrusted to them, and such recommendations relating to legislation in the public interest as 1 hey deem advisable. 1 ask for these reports and recommendations the deliberate ex amination and action of the legislative branch of the government. There are other subjects not embraced in the departmental reports demanding legis lative consideration, and which I should be glad to submit to you. i?ome of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous mss-iges, and as to them, I beg leave to repeat prior recommendations. As tiie law makes no provision for any report from the department of state, a brief history of the transactions of that import ant department, together with other mat ters which it may nereafrer be deemed es sential to commend to the attention of the congress, nun furnish the occasion for a future communication.

G. After the reading of the Journal in the senate today, the presiding officer was asked whether it was the pleasure of the senate to proceed .with the usual morning business. Mr. Harris suggested that bill3 and me morials might, be introduced and referred. Mr. Hoar opposed the proposition stating that it was an ancient custom of the senate not to enter upon any -ordinary business till after hearing the communication from the president at the beginning of the ses sion. That was a matter of respect due from the legislative department of the government to the executive. He there fore moved a recess for half an hour. The motion was agreed to. After the recss had been extended for a quarter of houran longer. Mr. .Merrill re ported that the joint committee appointed to wait on the president had performed the duty and had been informed that the president would immediately communi cate with the congress in writing. Thereupon, Mr. O. D. Pruden, one of the president's secretaries presented several messages in writing, and presiding officer laid before the senate the president's an nual message. Mr. M. C. Cork, secretary of the senate, at 1:03 commenced the reading of the mes sage. The reading of the message was concluded at 1:50, when the senate ad journed.

A cross-petition, filed in the court this evening in the case of Charles J. Hein-sheimer and others against the Dayton, Ft.

The Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton in this petition ac knowledges Ileinsheimer's petition as true, and unite- with him in the prayer and claims a huge interest in the road. It alleges that Ives and Stavner appropriated more than 1, (VO.OOO to their own use. The Cincinnati.

Derby writes from St. Thomas-, Dakota: We are having a great wheat blockade up here, as is usual with us every year at thi time. Cars are not forthcoming except where rival lines of railroad come together, ami even then not always in siilttcietit numbers to keep a market 'open for wheat. The Manitoba people said before harvest that they had lots of cars, enough to move the . crop re.ulilj. Now they say they were I mistaken.

TIIE FIDELITY CASH The Conrt Room Crowded Harper Still Cheerful and Hopeful. Cincinnati, Dec. G. Although the main facts in the great Fidelity bank failure caused by the famous but disastrous wheat deal withE. L. Harperas general manager, have been before the public for six months, yet the interest in the matter remains as vivid as ever. Today, for instance, when the whole day was devoted to dreary but damaging business 'records of the eccentricities of Harper's checks and drafts and certificates of deposit. With not a gleam of dramatic coloring, the court room was kept continually full. A large space is divided by a railing from the public domain, in which the parties, their council, members of the bar, the press and distinguished visitors are ad mitted. Among the last named are in cluded ladies. This space was today kept fully occupied by a continually changing assembly. The farther end of the room is open to the public, and almost a constant procession ot men passes in and out (as cnnosity leads them in and disappoint ment drives them out,) but they all move noiselessly under the constant watchfulness of two or three deputy marshals. But all are not disap pointed. They get to see Harper, the cen tral figure of the scene, with that unex pluinable courage and cheertulness wliich has never yet deserted him. He is the most interested man in the court room, but he betrays no worry nor annoyance. His black hair and line features dis tinguish him in a flattering contrast with his portly and somewhat lethargic counsel Messers Blackburn and Wilson. Mrs. Harper is also seen by these curiosity hun ters. Her gentle face shows no sign of weariness as she sits there through the long dull hours of the whole day's session giving what support her presence may be to her husband. They also see her sister, Miss Matthews, a beautiful girl with a telltale face hiding with diiliculty her emotions. Beyond the sight seeing there was little of interest today. The testimony almost all related to Harper's method of doing business. Albert F. Gay, individual book-keeper of the Merchant's National bank, testified to numerous overdrafts on their bank by J. W. Wilshire & Co. The same story was told by other witnesses about riwitt's iron and steel works. THE FARGO WILL CONTEST. Xew Yoiik, Dec. 6. The suit ot Miss Georgiana F. Fargo, the daughter of the millionaire expressman, against James G. Fargo, Charles Fargo and Franklin D. Locke, the executors of her father's will, was begun in the superior court today before Judge Truax. Miss Fargo was herself in court. She is a handsome woman of 130. In her complaint Miss Fargo stated that her father died on Au gust 3rd, 1SS1. His will decieed that his re siduary estate should be divided into three equal parcels. One of these was to go to her sister, Mrs. Helen Lacj Squires, one to the grandchildren of Mr. Fargo, Anna A. and .Mary Fargo and one to go to her. On March 25 all the legatees entered into an agreement that enough of the income of the estate should be allowed to accumu late to form an indemnity fund of .50.()00 to guarantee against any shrinkage in the estate. The executors were also to make an accounting every six months. Jn Feb ruary, 188.", the Surrogate of Erie county ordered that the beneficiaries should re ceive their shares of the estate. Only 10, 000 was paid to her and she alleged that C-10,!)2.'i.05was still due. Mr. Cole, for the executors, stated that proceedings for an equitable distribution ot the estate are now going on before the Surrogate; that the present action was un called for, and that it ought not to go on in the absence of all the other legatees. He said that the executors had no interest in the distribut ion. and that they only took the, position ot defendants in order to protect tiie absence of legatees. James G. Fargo was called as a witness, and testified that the executors had made accountings as ordered by the Surrogate. Mr. Foster, the young lady's attorney, charged that the executors had wiongfully accumulated $43,020.r0, and that his client was entitled to one-thiul of that. The case was adjourned one week. 

ABR1DGESU1T DECIDED. Toi'KKA, Kan., December!!. Action wa recently brought by the city of Topeka against the county of Shawnee to recover money paid for repairing the bridge acro.ss the Kansas River at this point, and to de termine the liability of the county for such repairs in the future. County At torney Curtis argued that the bridge be ing within the. city, and the city having the power ordinarily conferred in re spect to bridges, slieets and walks within its limits, owes tp the public the duty of keeping the same in safe condition for use in the usual mode by travelers. It was also set up that the city of Topeka was a city of the second class, when the bridge was purchased, at which time the bridge was within the city limits; that cities "of the iir&t clas have the same powers as cities of the second class; that, under the law, the company was in no way obliged to help keep it in repair, although it did help to ljuild it,for if the bridge was within the city limits when built, or as soon as it be came so, the duty of the city attached and the duty of the county ceased. The gist of the argument on the city's side w.is, that the bridge being a large one and cost ing many dollars to repair, it was the duty ot the county to shaie in the expense of keeping it hi order: that it was used equ ally by the people of the city and county, and that tl law only contemplated that the city should repair small bridges and culverts, and not bridges on public high ways used fully as much by people outside of the city as by the people ot the city. Judge Guthrie delivered a long opinion in the case today, holding that the bridge belongs jointly to the city and county, and gave judgment to the city for the amount claimed "as one-half the repairs for the year.

The San Jup company, a powerful Chinese organi- i zation here, split some time ago into two factions, allied the Bo Sin Seer and the Kie Sin Ser. Some highbinders, of the ' Kie Siu Seer faction killed two men of the ; I5o Sin Seer factiou, and the latter com missioned a trusty cutthroat named Iong ' i Ah Tick to avenge the slaughter of its members. Long Ah Tick accordingly , ' killed Ie Wy, who happened to lie the , first Kie Sin Seer man who came in range ' of his pistol. A party from the Kie Sin j St:r then went to the headquarters of the j Bo Sin Seer faction and tearing down the sign over the door chopped it into pieces. This is considered the highest indignity that am be offered h highbinders' organi zation and can only bu wiped out by blood. CONGRESS. BUT- LITTLE BONE BY EITHER 0 BODY.

At the joint con ference of the representative wool growe-s and wool dealers, held this morning, a committee was appointed to formulate views and wishes of the convention with respect to the tariff insofar as it effects t he wool industry, and to devise some plan ot action upon which growers, dealers and manufacturers may unite for the common good.

THE 

JOURNAL CLERKSHIP. Washington, Dec- 0. The priciple topic of conversation this morning among the members on the floor of the house was the change made last evening by Cleric Clark in the office of journal clerk. Mr. John j Robertson, who was appointed to succeed Mr.. Smith as journal clerk, took the oath of office this morning, and after consulta tion with his predecessor began, at once the discharge of his duties. lie is from In-1 dianapolis, was formerly judge of the In-' diana circut court and held for a time the ! position ot journal clerk to the state ' senate. It is rumored that Mr. Smith will ' make a fight for reinstatement and that the Democrat members will offer a resolu tion providing for inquiry into the vague statement that has been made to the effect that the change was the result of a promise by Indiana Democrats to support the clerk of the house in his candidacy for le-election if the office of journal clerk wasiven to an Indiana man, and that Don M. Dickinson had demanded Smith's removal. When Mr. Clark, clerk of the house, was spoken to on the subject, this morning, he declared positively that Mr. Dickinson had not communicated in anyAvay with him in regard to the matter. He had intended to make the charge last session he said, but had deferred action for various reasons. Xo member of the Indi ana delegation had been consulted upon the appointment, or knew of his intention to niiike the change, save Representative Mat son, who had been requested to furnish some information concerning Mr. Robert son's record. Mr. Clark denied in the strongest terms that there had been any Understanding between himself and the Indiana delegation relathe to his candi dacy for office of clerk. In all of these statements he was corioborated by Repre sentatives liglmes and other of Indiana Democratic representa fives. INGALLS TALKS. Washington, Dec. C An extended in terview with Senator Ingalls was pub lished today in which he gave his views respecting the surplus in the treasury. While agreeing that it should lie reduced nevertheless he deemed it a benefit rather than a detriment to the nation. He favored the establishment of a great national institution for the training of soldiers as officers are educated at West Point and Annapolis, but took strong grounds against the Blair educational bill While not favoring a large navy, lie advo cated the erection of impregnable coast defenses armed with the best modern guns and wished the government to construct public buildings in various sectious ot the countrv instead of renting them. He squarely announced .himelf as believing in protection for the sake of protection, but he did not think the tanii would be the leading issue of the next campaigu. as the real question would be whethei the Democratic party had verified its accusa tions against the Republican party and re deemed its pledges. Senator Ingallssaid Mr. Cleveland would be renominated by acclamation, but he doubted whether Blaine wanted the Re publican nomination. Sherman, he said, would have a strong following and, if nominated, would secure the party sup port. I Ie thought stranger things had hap pened than the nomination of Governor Foraker. Respecting Mr. Cleveland's stiength in lNb, he thought the president would be stronger in some localities and weaker in others. Mr. Ingalls took no stock in tly? fisheries commission and in sisted that any negotiation for a construc tion of the tn-aty of lblS based on commer cial muion with Canada in the interest of free trade would not be popularly received. He favored a commercial unibn with Cana da on the basis of annexation only, be lieving that political union would be an important step in an alliance between the Anglo-Saxon races. The whole interview was intensely partisan.

On the entire At lantic and gulf coast line of 2,670 miles' the sole armaV.ieut is 1-fci rilled guns, of which 110 are obsolete and of very low power. Even the few servicaeble guns that are mounted are of but little value. Some of them are mounted on little carriages and some of them are of inadaquate iirotection. The secretary referrs to General Schofield's re commendation that at least one eight-inch muzzle loading gun. with appliances for target practice, and one or more of the breech loading guns and mortars be fur nished to each artillery post with a view to the improvement of the artillery instruct ion. He says, however, that the depart ment is unable to comply with the request, as we have no gnns suitable for audi large practice and technical instruction. This division is garrisoned mainly by ar tillery. Four-fifths of the oilicers and men of that army being stationed within its limits. In no branch of the service is tech nical instruction and daily experiments and practice in the use of its weapons more demanded than in the artillery. It is earn estly hoped that it guns cannot be had for foitification, appropriations can be made for the purchase or manufacture of enough guns to employ the artillery and fit them for any emergency. In the division of the Missouri during the past year, it has been necessary to patrol the Oklahoma country iu the Indian Territory, to kecpout iutru doosand to protect the Indian reservations A considerable bodj of troops have been constantly engaged in this duty and there have been no serious disturbances. A brief history is included in the report of the diffieulty'that arose in August last in Colorado net ween the state authorities anil Colorow's band of Ttes, and it is said that some efforts should certainly be made for the restitution of their property to the Indians. The secretary strongly approves of the recommendation contained in Gen. Sheridan's report,touching the extension of all possible aid by the general government to the national guard of the different states and suggesting a system of national encampments for state militia at the ex pense of the national government. Attention is called to the fact that the Pacific coast is destitute of fortifications, guns and aftnament of every description, while San Francisco is without a single "gun which can he lired with safety with present charges of powder aud modern pro jectiles. Favorable endorsement is also given to the lieutenant general's recom mendation that the present strength of army be increased by j,000 men, and par ticular attention is called to the import ance of the artillery .arm of the service and certa'n changes in the present organization of artillery regiments The schools of instruction, .the secretary says, afford admirable post graduate coulees of study and it will be necessarj-. as it is desirable, that every ollicer should take his-tour of study, in order that he may be fully equipped for his duty. He trusted that the bill introduced in the senate at the la-t session requiring the ex amination of officers for promotion may be passed by congress.
