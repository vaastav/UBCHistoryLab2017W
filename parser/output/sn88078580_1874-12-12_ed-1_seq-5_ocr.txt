ASHTABULA TELEGRAPH EXTRA. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. T tft ienmt ni Ecnte of Rtprtttnta- Siec the conTentcg of Congress, one year ago, the nation has undergone a trroatraUon la business eu 1 industries sad u ku sot. bees witnessed with as for aany yean. Speculation as to the abacs for this prostration might be in dulged in wilhoutpmfit, bemuse as many theocte would be advanced as there were independent writers those who ex tressed tiieir own Tievs without borrow ing apoa the subject, without indulging in theories as to the causes or this pros tration. Therefore I will call your at tertuxi only to the fact, and to some questions as to which it it would seem there stwsUd be do disagreement Dur ing Ibis prostration two essential ele ments of prosperity have been most abudant labor and capital. Both have beea larc!; snemployed. Where secu rity at leen nucoubted capital has been attainaol a at very moderate rates. Where labor has been wanted it has been found in abundance at cheap rates, compared with what necessaries and comforts of life could be purchrsed with the wages demanded. T wo great elements ot pros pmtf, therefore, baye not been denied a. A third might be added : bar soil and olimale are unequal ud within the battta of any contiguous territory nnder aoe BaUonality for the Tarieties of pro ts to feed and clothe a people., and in the amount of surplus to spare to feed, less favored doodIc Therefore, with1 taea (acts in view, it seems to me that wMsatatesmanshiD at this session of Con gress would dictate, ignoring the past ad tsveoung in proper cnaneis uiese srasi elements of prosperity to any needle. Debt abroad is the only element that caa," with always a sound currency, sasier auto oar aSair to cause any con tistaed depression ia the industries and ftmpeatjr of our people, a great con fitcf for naUonal exi&ience made neces- way for temporary purposes the raising at iarye sews oi money irom whatever soaroe attainable. It wns made neces easy, ia the wisdom of Congress, aad I to oot Ooabt their wisaom in me premi MS regarding the necessity of the times, to sense a system ot national currency, - wtuoh proved to be impossible to keap a par with the recognized currency of the Airktsaa woria. lius oego a m&rr ov spbccutio. iavoivaz aa extraTagance and loxury ot required far the happinev or pros- perHv ot a peepie ana WTotvmg, do in ai . ixaf and indireotly, foreign indebted Bees. The currency being-of a fluctua ting value, and therefore unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject oi specula tion in itself. These two causes, bow ever, bare involved us ia a foreign in debtedness, contracted in good faith by the borrower and lender, which should be paid ia coin . and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was eontracted, ia sold or its caaiv lest. The good faith of the government cannot be vwltted towards ita creditors witboet national disgrace. Oar commeroe ahotfid be enoocreed, American ship build ing and carrying oapacity increased, foreign maffceti sought for the prodacta of our soil aai isnafaoWies, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a bet can be created for the sale of oar pro- daesa, either of the soil, the mine, or the awrfaotory, a new means is diaoovered of ntliiaiBg our idle capital and labor, to the advantage of the whole people; bet in my yadgment the first step towards acoompliab sBguus object is to secure a' currency good wherever oviliettion reigns one which if tt becomes surperabundant with one people wk and a market witn some other; a cur rency which has as its basis the labor neeanarr to prodooe it and . which will give its value. Gold and silver are now the reoogaked mediums of exchange the eiviiiaed werld over, and to this we ahoald retam with.the least practioable delay. In view 01 tee pledges ot tbe American Con enjs whan oar present legal-tender system . was adopted and debt eontracted, there herald be no delay; certainly no unaeces- aarv delay, in tiling by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the aosomrJishTnetit of this end I invite yoar apeeul attention. I believe firmly that there oea be no prosperous and per- Baaoeot eenval ot bBsueta and ia daetries atitil a policy is adopted. with legislation toearry it out, lt'i"g to a Karats to A aracs &asu. It is easy to oonoeive that the debtor and apeeniatove ot asses may think it of value to make so-called money abandant antil they an tnrow a portion of their hardens apoa othera, but evea thaM I believe wvafd be disappointed in the reuls if a eeuee ahould be porsoed which will keep m ooaM toe raiae ec ana legal tender me dian of exfihaneea. A revival of sro- dnptive indastriee is needed by all olaans; by aone more than the holders of property f whatever sort, with debta te liquidate iraca realiaatioa noon the salaa. Kat ad.' avftstA that these two oUsses of oitiaenM ana to b beneficed by expansion, would ill be honeat to give it I would not the gen eral loaa be too great to justify each re lief T. Would it not be jolt as honet aad as pnaden to authoriaa each debtor to iaiae hia own legal tenders to the extent of h abilities ? Than ta do this, woold it not be safer, for fear of over iaraes by na MtapeSowa creditors, to eay that all debt vahgationa are obliterated in the United atatea, and now wa eoaunenoe anew, eeen. possessing all he has at the time, tree irom eneumbranoet These pro poartiefM are too absurd to be enter tained for a moment by thinking people. Krery delay " in prapara tioa for final resumption partakes of tiia dishonesty, and is only less ia decree aa the proposition ia held oot. The convenient eeason will at bat arrive for the good work of redeeming ear pledges to eommeroe. It will never eeaae, In my opinion, except- by positive action by Congress or by national disasters, which will destroy, for a time at least, the credit of individuals and the state at large. a aoawa cvasjsror must not be reached by total bankroptoy ofj of andmduals. I believe it ia in the power! oi ogress as uua session to devise sucb legislatioa as wi renew eoafideaee, revive all the iaduatriea, start aa on a career of prosperity to last for many yean, and to save the credit of the nation and the peo ple. Steps toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisites to this de- . voU T-to-be-songht for end. There are others which I may touch upon hereafter. A nation dealing in aeurrenoy below that of specie in valne labors nnder two great dis-adv-es first, having no use for the world's acknowledged medium of exchange, gold and silver, these are Driven ont of the eoontry because there ia no demand for their aae; seoond, the medium of exobange in - use being of a AWaating value for after all it . is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver metals, having an intrinsic value just in proportion te the honest labor ft takasto produce them a large margin mast be allowed for profit by the man a. . factarer and producer. It ia months from the date of production ta the date of reali sation, and interest upon capital jpust be barged and the risk of fiactuatif u the vaiae of that which ia to be rtnj'td ia paysnent added. Henoe high prises, act. lag as a protection to the foreign producer, who receives nothhig in exchange for the prodaet of hia skill and labor exoapt a earrenoy good at a stable value the world ever. It seems to me that nothing ia dearer than thecreater part of the burden of the ei is ting prostration for the want of onad financial system falls upon the workiag man, who must, alter all, pro- da j the wealth, and the salaried man who daserin tends and oonaact the business. the burden falls upon them in two ways by the deprivation of employment and by the decreased purchasing power of their aaiar.es. f u.u w' V."""" w "rTi se tha method ot correcting tb irj. which are acknowledged to nd not mine; cut l wiu yea- tare io suggest two or three things which teem io me as absolutely necoassry to a return to specie payment, the first great requisite ia a return to pros perity. , The legal tender clause to the law authorizing the issue ot currency by the national government ahonld be re pealed, to take eff act aa to all contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repeal' ins act: not .to sddIv. however, to pay ments of aaiariea by the government or for other expenaesnot provided by law to be paid in currency. Ia the interval pending between repeal and final resumptioa. pro vision ahould be made bv which the .Secre tary of the Treasury can obtain gold aa it may become necessary from time to time. From the date when specie re sumption eommencVJe to this might and should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure aa accumula tion of gold in the Treasury to sustain) re demption. I commend this subj set to your careful consideration, beiievinc that a fa vorable solution is attainable, and that if reached by this Congress that the present and future generations will ever j-ratefnuy remember it as their deliverer from. thraildom of evil and disgrace. With re-1 sumption w v Kav BaxKiso may be authorised with safety,' giving :iH protection to billholdera which they have aider existing laws. Indeed, I would regard free back ing aa essential. It would- give proper, elasticity to the currency. As mora out reocy should be required for the transec tion of legitimate business new banks would be started, and ia turn banks would wind no their business when it was -found there was a saperabundance of eurfeuey.J The expenenoe and judgment of the peo ple can best decide just how much carseacy ia required for the transaction of the busi ness of the country. It is Boaafe ta leers the settlement of this question to Con gress, the Secretary of the Treasury ar tbe executive. Congress should make .the regulation, under which (banks may lit bat ahould not mike banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable piper eurreney that shall be authorized. ,Such importaaoe do I attach to this subjeet aad so earnestly do I oommend it to your at tention that -I give prominenoe by intro ducing it at the beginning of this Ueasaga. THE 

STATE DEPARTMENT. the past year . nothing hit' occurred to disturb aae general friendly and cordial relation of the United State with other powers. The correspondence submitted herewith between this govern ment and ita diplomatic representatives ot other eoentnee shows a saUstaetory " tion of all eaestiene between the United States and the most of those eosatrieavl and witai few exoeptiooa, to which refer ence ia hereafter made, tbe absence ef aay points ef difference to be adjusted.,'. The notsos direoted by the resolution of jCeev greas of June 17th, 1874, to be given -to terminate the convention of inly 17th, 1S53. between Tars vnraa statbb ays esxoitm,''. has been given and the treaty wiB aoeord ingly terminate oa the first day cf -July, 4875. This convention secured to oertaia Belgian vessels entering the parts ef the United States exceptional privilege',, which are not accorded to our own vesseia. Other features of the convention have proved satisfactory and have tended to the cultivation of mutuallv beneficial oonuuei- cial intercourse and friendly relation) bt tween the two countries. 1 bope that tK negotiations which have been invite&.will result in the celebration of another treaty, which may tend to advance the interests c-f both countries. ' OTR IUSATiaS8 WITH nmn i' cl continue to be friendly. During the past -year the fear of hostilities between China and Japan, growing out of the landing of an armed force upon the Island of Komoea by the latter, has occasioned BeassneesM T . .1 t. a i AL-AAV-t difficulties ariaini from this eanse will be adjusted, and that the advanoe of civilizaJ tion in those empires may not be retarded by a state of war. In oontequenoe of tbe part taken by certain eitWsna ot: the United btates ia tha expedition - oar representatives in those countries have been inatraoted to impress upon the governments of China and Japan tbe firm intension of this country to maintain striet neutrality in the event of hostilities, and carefully prevent any infraction of law bo the pait of cur citizen, la connection with this subject I call the attention of Congress to a generally eoneeded fast, that the great propottion of who eonte to oar shores do not oomi-al-untarily te make their homes with as sad their labor prodaotive ot tbe general pros perity, but come coder eon tract with head men, who own them almost absolutely'. In a worse form does this apply to Chinese women. Hardly a perceptible percentage of them perform any honorable labor, but they are brought for shameful purposes, to the disgrace of the communities ia which they are settled aad to the greet demoral- iattiaB of tbe youth of those localities. ,: If this evil practio caa be legislated against it will be my pleasure, as well as my duty. to enforce aay regulation to secure so de sirable aa end. It as hoped that the negotiation be-' tween the government of U lAfim aits thx Run rowt&a,-- " looking to the further opening of the em pire and to the removal of varioaa restric tions upon trade and sravel, may soon pro duce the resalts desired, which cannot fail to enure to the benefit of all the parties. Having on previous oooasioo submitted, to tne oonauleration of lAmereee the propriety of the release of the Japanese govaro- ment. from the further payment of indemnity under the oonventioa of Octo ber 22. lb&L sod a na action had been taken thereon, it became my daty to. re gard the obligation of the convention - as in force; and aa the other powers inter ested have received their portion of the indemnity in full, the Minister of the United State in Japan has, on behalf of wis government, received tne remainder oi tne amount due to the United State- un der the oonvention of Simon osekL I sub mit the propriety of aimlvinir the' in some of a part, ii not the whole of this fund, to U- ,j . . . . euuoauwi, u we wspauete language, ot a number of young men, to be under obligations to the government far a speci fied time as interpreters at the legation and the consulates in Jsnea, A limited number of JaBanm youths might ' at the aame time be ed coated in our own vernacular, and mutual benefits would result to both .cov ernments. The importance of having our own citiaans competent and familiar with the language of Japan, to act as interpre ters and in other capacities oonnected with the legation and consulates in that country, cannot readiJy be overestimated. BRITISH CLAIMS. The amount awarded to the aroverninent ox vreat Dtitain by the mixed commission organised under the provisions of the Treaty of Washington, in settlement of "the claims ot British aabject arising from acts committed between April 18. 1S41. and April 9, 18G5, became m- able under the terms of the treaty within the past year, and was paid upon tbe VI lit day of September, lav, in this con nection I renew my recommendation made at the opening of the last aessioa of Cen gress that a special oourt be created to hear and determine all euums oi aliens against the United States, arising Irom acta com mitted against their persons or property auring the tniurrecuon. It appears eqoM liable that opportunity ahould be offered to eiucena oi other atatea to present their elaims, as well aa to those British subjects whose claims were not admiaaable nnder the bite OOmmission. to the earlv donkinn of some competent tribunal, To this and I recommend the neoesaary legislatioa to organises court to dispose of those claims of aliens of the nature referred to in an equi table and satisfactory manner, and to re lieve Congress and the Departments from the consideration of these question. . ihe legislation necessary to extend to the colony of New Foundland the pro visions of oertain at tioles of the SRSAfT Of WiSBISOTOW of the 8th day of May. 1871. having been had, a protocol to that effect was signed on behalf of tbs Uuited States and of Qreat JBrjtain oa the ?Sth 'day of atsy but, aad duly proclaimed on the following day.

Formerly. amid oonfiietiag opinions and decision, it was dimoult to exactly determine now tar the doctrine of perpetual allegiance waa applicable to citizens of tha United Mates. Con cress, by the act of the 27th of July, 1863. asserted the abstract right of expa triation as a fundamental principle of this government.

In view of the large national debt exiaing and the obligationi to add one per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a suaa amounting now to over $34,000,000 per aednm, I submit whether the revenues should not be increased or expenditures diminished to reach, this 'amount. of sur- gas."'.

THE WAR DEPARTMENT.

Legislation is de sirable to render more efficient this branch of the publie service. All the recom mendations of the Secretary of War I re gard as judicious, and I especially com mand to your attention the following:1 The consolidation of government arsenals ; the restoration of mileage to officer travailing under orders ; the exemption oi money received from the sale of (ubaisterke stores from being covered into the treas ury; the use of appropriations for the pur chase of subsistence stores without wait ing for the, beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation ia made; for adai1 tional appropriations far the oolkctionof torpedo material;' for increased appropri ations for -the manufacture of arms; for relieving the various states from indebted-. ness for arms oharfred to Warn during the rebellion; for' the dropping of ofiioers from the rolls of ttrS army without trial; for the offenos of drawing pay more than once for tits tame period; for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by checks, aad for the .establishment ot a ' professorship of Khetorie sad English' literatare at .West 1'oint. The reasons for the recommends.- tions are obvious, and are set' forth tfuffi-T eiently in the report attached.

I respectfully suggest to Congress the propriety oi increasing the number of judicial districts in the Uaited States to eleven, the present number being nine. The territory to be traversem by the Circuit Judges ia so great and the business of the court so steadily increasing, that it ia growing more and more impossible for them to keep up with ths business requir ing their attention. Whether this would involve tha aaceasitv ef adding two more Juitices cf the Supreme Court to the pre aent number I submit to ths judgment of Cougres. . ' f ! 

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. The attention of Congress is 'invited td the report of the Secretary of the Interior and to the iegiiww" w "j The domestic interests of the people are mora intimateiy oonnected. with this ds nartment than with either of the other departments of the government. 1 ts duties have been added, to from time to tone, until they have become ao onerous that ithnot the moat perfect (vatem and order will b impossible for any Secretary of me anterior w seep w . vu.v.m transections having his sanction and his name, and for which he is held personally responsible. The polity adopted for the management ot " , buhajt AJVABia, . known as the peace aoliey, has beea ad hered to with moat beoeaeial result...-it confidently hoped that in a few years more our frontier will bs free from danger from Indians. 1 commend the recommen dation ef the Secretary for tha extension the homestead laws to tha. I ldiana and for some sort of territorial government tor the IndianTtirritory. A great majority of the Indians occupying this territory are believed ito be incapable of maintaining their rights against the more civilized and enlightened white man. If a territorial i form-of government should be given them the government should protect them in their home and property for a period of at leaat twenty year, ) and before ita final adoption it ahould be ratified by a majority of those affected. The report of the Sec retary of tbe Interior herewith attached, gives much interesting statistical informa tion, which I abstain from giving an ab stract of, but refer you to tha re port.itself. PENSIONS. . The act of Congress providing the oath which pensioners must subscribe before 'drawing their pension cuts off from this bounty a few survivors of the war at 1S1-2 residing in the Southern State. I recoiri mend the restoration of 'thia bounty to aui "e numoer ef persons whose name would be restored to the list of pen sioners is not large. They are old persona who could have taken no part in the rebel lion, and the services for which they were awarded pensions were in defense of the whole country. AGRICULTURAL REPORT. The rt part of the Commissioner of Agri culture, herewith submitted, contains sug gestion of much interest to the general public, and refers to the AFFKOACEIXO CECTBSKIAL and tha part his department ia ready to take in it I feel that the nation at large ia interested in having thia expuaition a success, and commend to Congress such action as will secure a greater general in terest in ik Provision has already been made for the foreign nations which have signified their intention to be represented at it, and it is probable that every civil ized nation of the globe will take part in the exhibition. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. The rule adopted to improve the civil service of the government have been ad hered to as closely as has beea practicable with the opposition with which they met. The effect I believe has been essential on the whole, aad has tended to the elevation ef the service ; but it ia impracticable to main Lain them without the direct and pos itive support of Congreaa, Generally the support which this reform receives is from those who give it their support only to una isuit when tbe nuea are apparently departed from. Removal from office without preferring cbargea against the parties removed are frequently cited as departures from the rules adopted. and the retention of those .against whom charges are . made by irre sponsible persona and without good grounds is also often condemned aa a viola tion of them. Under these circumstance. therefore, I announce that if Congress ad journs without positive legislation on the suDje.it of Civil Service Reform I will re gard inch action . as a disapproval of the system and will abandon it except so far as to require examinations for oertain ap pointees to '"determine their fitness, and competitive examination will be aban doned. The gentlemen who have given their service without compensation aa members of the Hoard to Devise Kuiee and Regulations for the government of the civil service of the country have shown much zeal and earnestness in their work, and to them, aa well as to myself, it will be a source of mortification if it is to be thrown away; but I repeat that it ia im possible to earrv thia av stem to a aaccesa ful Issue without general approval and as sistance, and positive law to support it. THE LABOR PROBLEM. , I have stated that the elements of pYor perity to tbe . nation cipital labor. skilled -and unskilled, and the products of the sou still remain with us. To direct the employment cf these is a problem deserving . the most serious attention of Congreaa. If employ ment can be given to all labor offering itself prosperity necessarily follows. I have expressed the opinion and repeat it that the first requisite to the accomplish ment of this end is the substitution of a sound eurreney in place of one of fluctu ating value. Thia secured there are many interests that might be fostered to the great profit of both labor and capital. How to induce capital to employ labor is the question to be decided. The subject of Ib&ap XBAH8F0BTA710B' has occupied the attention of Congress, e light on this question will without doubt be given by the committee appointed by the last Congress to investigate and report upon these subjects. ' A revival of Ship BciLDiya, particularly of iron steamship building, is of vast importance to our national prosperity.. The United States is now paying over f 1,000, 000, COO per an num for freights and pauage on foreign ships, to be carried abroad and ex pended in the employment and support of other peoples. It is to be regretted that this disparity in the carry in? trade exats, and to correct it I would be willing to take a great departure from the usual course of government in supporting what might mually be termed private enterprise. would net suggest as a remedy direct sub sidy to American ateamship lines, but l would suggest the direct, effer of smp'e compensation for carrying the mails be tween the Atlantic seaboard cities aad the Continent on American -owned and Ameri: can-built stealers, and would extend this liberality to vessels carrying tha mails to the South American states and to Central America and Mexico, and would pursue the same policy from our Pacific seaports to foreign seaports oa . the Pacific. It tight be demanded that vessels built and for this service ahould eems up to a tiand ard fxed by leeialatioa in tonnage, speed, and ail other qualities looking to ths possibility of ths government requiring them at some time for war purpose. . The rifibt. also, of takinr poaaessioo ef them io such emergency should be guarded. I offer these suggestions believing them to be worthy ofeonaideration in all seriousness, affecting sections and all intereata alike. If anything better can be done to direct the eoontry into a course of general prosperity aone wui be more ready than i to second the plan. Forwarded herewith will be found the report of the eommiamonera appointed under an act of Congress approved Jaoe 20. 1374, to wind up the affaire of ' ' TBM DBJTKiar A3D OOVXRKMEXT. It will be seen from the report that the total debt oi tha District of Columbia, less securities on band and available, ia bond ed debt iasued prior to July 1st, 1874, $d,8S3 940.43 ; 8.65 bond, act of Congree of June 20, 1874, r2.08S.163 73 ; oertidcatea of the Board cf Andit, 14 770,658 43; total, $15,742,667.61; less special improvement aasessmanucnargaDie to private property in excess of demands against aach assessment, SI, 614. 054 37; less Chesapeake and Ohio Canal bonds, 175 000; leaa Washington and Alexandria Baiiroad bonds, (59,000; less cash in the hands of the Commissioners of the Sicking Fund, f 1,748,054 37-leaving the actual rf.ht lea said accounts. 113.994.613 24 Io addition to this there are claims preferred against the Governor and of the Dittriot amounting in lae aggregate, reported oy the Baard of Audit, o 3,147,7S7 48, of which tho greater part will probably be rejected. Thia ram can with no more pro priety be included in the delt of the Dii trict government than can the thousand of claim (gainst the general government be included as a portion of the national debt. But the agaregate sum thus stated includes something more than the funded dett, chargeable exclusively to the District of Columbia. The act of Congrasa of November 2Stb, 1S74, contemplates aa apportionment between the United State government and the Dis trict of Columbia in respect of the payment ot - tbe principal and interest of tbe 3 oj bonds, j bereiore in computing with pre cision the bonded debt of tha District, the aggregate sums above stated aa lespect the 3 65 bonds now issued, the outstand ing oertifioates of the Board oi Audit, and the unadjusted sums now before that board ahould be reduced to the extent of the amount to be apportioned to the United States government in the manner indicated in tbe aot of Congreaa of Jans 20, 1P74. . I especially invite your attention to the rec ommendation of the Commissioner of the Sinking Fund relative to the ambiguity of the act of June 20, 1874, the interest on the District ' bonds, and the con solidation of ths indebtedness of the District, 1 feel much in debted to the gentlemen who consented to leave their private affairs and come from a distance to attend to the business this District and for the able and satis factory manner in ahioh. il laa teen con ducted. I am sure their services will be qually appreciated by tbe entire country. r-7,701,r500; 1, St. It will be seen from the accompanying foil report of the Board of Health that the SASITABT COJTDmOS OF THI DISTRICT is very satisfactory. In my oDinion tfco District of Columbia should be regarded as the grounds of the national capitol, ia which the entire people are interested. X do not allude to thia to induce a eneraaa appropriation to the District, but to draw the attention of Congress in fram ing a law for the government of the District: to the magnificent ecale on which the city wa planned by the founders of the govern nent: and the manner in which, f jr orna mental purposes, the reservation, streets, and avenues, were laid out, and tha pro portion of the property actually possessed by the general government, I think the proportion of the expense of the govern ment and improvements to be borne by the general government, in the cities of Washington and Georgetown, should be . c artfully and equitably defined. in accordance with section 3 of the set approved June 23d, 1874, I appointed a board to make a survey of the MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI P.IVXR, with a view to determine the best method of securing and maintaining a depth of water sufficient for the purposes cf commerce, and in accordance with an act entitled Aa act to provide for the appointment of a eommie -ion of engineer to investigate and report a permanent plan for the excavation of the -alluvial basin of tbe Mississippi River, subject to inundations," I appointed a commission of engineer. .Neither board ha yet completed its labor. When their ; reports are finished they will be forwarded to Congress without delay. U. S. GRANT. U. S. GRANT. EXECUTIVE MANSION, Dec. 7, 1874. FORTY-THIRD CONGRESS. SECOND SESSION. SENATE.
