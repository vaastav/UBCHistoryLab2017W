From the. movements of the rebels during the | past day or two, in congregating their lories in large u.asses between Ocaquan and Manas, us ami iii the vicinity of Acotink und Colchester, it is thought that they anticipate an immediate attack by the grand army of General MeClellan. The terror? of conflagtavion have seized upon the city ol Charleston, South Carolina?tho nursery and hotbed of rebellion. A terrific fire ha. been raging there since Wednesday night, wbi h has destroyed nearly all the business portion ot Die City up to this time, mid in last accounts the flame? were still spreading so fast over the business dis trict and fashionable dwelling? In the direction of the Ashley river that Die total demolition of the most valuable portion of the city is imminent. We give to-day in our columns a detailed ac count of Charleston, and of the district which has suffered by the fire, Illustrated by a map of the city of Charleston, with copious references. The -dark portions of the map represent the progress of the destructive element, and although it seems to cover a comparatively small space, yet it in cludes the most Important linriceis part of ti t city. , The fire is aet down to the work of en Lti' C'ndiaiy. It If believed tu be tht net of the negroes, about whohs discontent SBd contemplated insurrection (it the city end ?oui.try many rumors were afloat in Charleston and Its vic.nity tor some time i feint. Whether the conflagration had ksorigii* in this ?euros or not, It will undoubtedly be so believed throughout the country, and all over the world.

On our side only thirty men wer? killod. Mr. Iligginbottom, the American Consul at An. t'guu, died at that place November 20. Our news from Missouri to-day is not without importance.

In the absence of actual hostilities, it con soles its readers by announcing that the Halifax schooner Emery had run the blockade of Savannah w ith a cargo of'turpentine and made her British port in safety. He also adds that the Emery ran into RavyunaU with a cargo of pork nud salt fish, aud that her owner got $50 a barrel for the pork from the rebels.

Burning ?>f Clinvliilnu-HeportKl \cgio iHsiirrtrllon. \Sro publish this morning details by telegraph of t)m almost total destruction by fire of the business portion of the city of Charles ton?ov.o of the most extendvo coufkigrn turns which ever took place on the American continent. The news In brief reached thin city yesterday forenoon, and created the greatest excitement. Rut the particulars which we fur oisli our renders this morning are appalling in the extreme. It appears that the fire broke out about nine o'clock on Wednesday night, in ltussell A Co.'3 wash factory, in Hazel street, at the intersection of Kast Bay street, close to the Cooper liver and extended across the street to Cameron's great iron foundry, where rebel cannon have been manufactured ever since the rebellion broke out. It extended along E;r-t Ray Street to Broad, and through Broad street in the direction of Meeting street. By refcreiice to the map which wo pul?li h on our first page, it will he seen that the burned district extends from East Buy on the cast to King street west, and from Broad street south to Queen street north. But the lire was still raging, and had crossed to the south side of Broad street, in one portion of that street. How far it may hare since travelled south, north and west it is impossible to tell. As it. is. the heart of the city is burned out, and property to the amount of ten millions of dollars is consumed. It is worthy of remark that Institute Hull? where the Democratic Convention was In-hl which split the party and split the nation; the theatre to winch the secessionists retired to hold a separate convention; St. Andrew's Hull ? where the Mozart faction figured; tt>e Chni'os t';n Hotel and the Mills House wl etv ll\e w "> ring faction; respectively hold their hend'omr ter.-; Hibernian Hail where the .-eecs-i . 1 or?'ti_ nance was passed: the cannon and unit. milieu foundries. the tiv.cmu she; ? of the Mi..-in/ and f'"trier, ami tU- i;etdtpi..rfeis oi Co. :i. ?

M hat. was the pree"?6 origin of the fire is not yet satisfactorily settled. But there Is a gene ral belief that it was the work of the incendi ary. Among the poor whiles there is ample cause for discontent -oppression of the dirc.-t Kind. M bother any of these have taken the present opportunity to avenge thvmsvht-. or whether tiny have acted in concert with the negroes, we are unable to determine. It is staled that a quantity of arms was found under the floor of a negro's cabin, "all new and in j good order.'" lie could have only obt .iiied ' them from w hile men. Other negroes were found i to have kuivos and bntcbets secreted. D is ; stated, indeed, that, a negro who has been ar- : reded is the ineendiary, ninl that h'. .v.-l was | iiut the currying out of a plot tevi led by j sonto of the negroes to their masters la this connection ll may be observed tita', in the ab sence of the firemen in the army, the negroes were called upon to work the en gine.. and tlioy broke the two best of them. We are informed that ike negro iiiMitr .ctioiv was promptly suppres-ej. }!n| of that the evidence is not very satisfactoryt for we are told that they were to be joined by large bauds of negroes from the country, who were to come in armed at night. Another ac count 'fate* that u servile insurrection had actually broken ?> it in the country two days previous to the fire, end thati! was sthi inpvo gre.-s: but tbie is not confirmed. It is evident Rut the terror which prevailed could not have the result of an accidental fire, however extensive. V.'e ore told that families were barricading tbeir house;, and that the greatest consli ination prevailed. [? will be recollected by our readent that j to n. rul Drayton, who commanded the relv.-l force at Port Royal, took pains to state that the Have wore nil quiet, and s.howed no dispo. eition to leave their maulers or join t!ic federal fctnudanl. We thought at the time that this statement looked suspicious; and it in probable that ci.bcr llraytoo was dissembling or that the negroes dissembled in order that they might lull suspicion. The slaves a;e cunning, and this is ju t ?Lc course they would be likely to pursue if they meant mischief. Should the new ? of the insnr rection prove true it will sp ten or and constcrn it ion all ovet tin? kotbh, as cin a%*? ??????<*. tioti ti Virginia in lefHl. atld tkenofcro iinaivoc tfcn of Denmark Vwey in Charleston itfo'f in which wa fomented by abolition euriu Bat.ea from 91.

What must bo tbo startling effect i>t tuld i??" tolligence upon the oiiuy of Pourvreg^rd and Johnston on tbo Potomac! Will it not disor ganize and bioak it up, and will not the troops i from South Carolina rush instinctively to their homes to defend them against tho common dan ger -' the Yankees" without and tho negroes within? And will not tbo troops from Georgia, Florida, Alabama and all the cotton States follow their example? Numerous dcvelope monts in tl o Southern States of late conspire to discourage the rebellion?tho bridge burn ing and Union rising in Tennessee, the revolt in Nushvillo against drafting, tho conspiracy ia New Orleans, the disaffection in Arkansas, the Union rally in North Carolina, and now the awful catastrophe which reduces Charleston? like Carthage of old?te a heap of ashes. That oily was the bead and front of the rebellion, and it is now blotted out by the hand of Provi dence; and the operations of the stone fleet in the mouth of its harbor will prevent forever its resurrection. Spitiu llantrnlut; to Her Prey lu the !X*w World?The Duty of the American Go vern mint. We published recently an important piece of intelligence from the capital of Spain, to the effect that orders had been issued to General Prim and his staff in tie middle of November to hold themselves in rrndhiess to leave for Mexico without delay, instead of ut the cad of the month, as originally intended. By intelligence since received, we learn that the General sailed on the 2titli of November, and was expected at Havana on the l*>tb of December. Meantime Have divisions of the expedition have already sailed for Vera Cruz, and the first division were within thirty-six hours of that port I at the last accounts. The Espana gives a pretty clear idea of Ihft nature of the military expedition of which General l'riin is ordered in it: ' em! haste to assume the command. "In politi cal circles," it says, "tho project of forming in America a confederation of all the republics of Spanish origin, with Spain at the bead ol it, is now being discussed. Such a measure, it is af firmed, would possess groat advantages both for Spain and for thoso little States. 'I his an nouncement foreshadows tho attempt ol Spain to reconquer all her old colonies, under the guise of recovering debts from the Mexican govern ment and of obtaining redress for the maltreat ment of her subjects in Mexico. It is with a view to this end that the staff of General l'riui consists of a largo number of civil aswoll as military officers. They arc needed for gover nors of Spanish-American provinces. The Spa nish journals have long since claimed the Cbinca Islands, which are mines of wealth, and no doubt these will now he -Matched from Pom. The tone of the speech of the Queen of Spain leaves no doubt about, the ulterior designs of (lie expedition to Mexico. Tho soizuro of St. Domingo, the oldert Ame rican posse sion of Spain, was Lev first step in a new career of conquest on the American con tinent. Once the most powerful maritime na tion of Kurope--a nation of whom it was paid that the sun never pet upon her dominions -she gradually declined, in con -oqueucc of her civil wars, war* of rul.Vocation, nod other causes, till she became a third or fourth rate Power, strip ped ol all her va t American possession . from the southern boundary of the United ti des to | Pope Horn, with the exception of Cuba ami one j or two small islunds. Ho poor was she at last that there was none to do her reverence. IV ii.lt in less than half a century England saved her from becoming a French province. But recent 1 l v she has taken a fresh start in national life, and, owing to the statesman ?hip of Napoleon, she is steadily advancing to the goal of a newly aWohened ambition. The Emperor of the i- rench proposed to the other tour great Powers ol Eu 1 rope that Spa in houid be admitted us a sixth \ Power iiis object being not s?. uiuch to ad vance her interests as to j_c.t' lmr vote in the I congress of first class nation-, in order the bet ;er to e.urv out If European policy, end to lor ! ft'y him-nil' ag ? nst the intrigues of other IVa ??? jealous of Ms influence and distrustful i i" If designs. England is so mneli afraid of him that ill Jm- t lea-l appeared io yield to ! l i views in the eaao of Spain, am! has become | a party to her schemes of aggrandizement in the i New World, 'j he London Times ndmi'a the feel, and says "Spain is renewing her youth, w hi'e the irnii .-i States ami Mexico iirc fulling into premature decrepitude and decay."' Spain, adds the That?, will naturally see in this IripaUiti expedition, in which she is joined i by Great Britain and Prance, "a substantial i proof that she is rapidly regaining the ' place which tic onco occupied in the first run!, among iho Powers of Europe -she is admitted n? a confederate by two Slates which aspire to control the destinies of the world." And ili.ii ?de will be sue essfftl in her enler prise lie DrtlL-U journalist lias no doubt?-so gn at N her opportunity, and so feeble is tho ieMijtiiv.ee that can b" ofl'ered to lmr. Mexico j has been so long engaged in civil war that it i has become a chronic disease in Die republic, | and .-be is completely exhausted. Tho sumo may be said of tho Central American and South American republics. Their condition is anar chy and ' haoe, and they are just in the position to be nmo the easy p' ey of the monarchy whose | yoke vary long sua e cast. oil', j " But tint nlvw would not be u sufficient t ground for Miecew.

U hile the war is vigorously prosecuted, in the meantime not a day or an hour should be lost in making arrangements with Mexico to assume her debt, on tho security of her terri tory. It is only sixty millions. There are houses iu New York which would be glad to take it if endorsed by our government. Thero would thus be no inconvenience and no risk. A treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, could ut tho strnte tiiuo be agreed upon which would enable the Uniied States not only to re sist any European aggression upon the rights of Mexico, but aid the lawful government fn sup pressing anarchy anil maintaining public order. 11 the debt wore thus assumod tho whole ques tion would bo settled at once; for the personal outrages upon Europeans resident in Mexico would only need 011 apology to atone for them.

It is no less remarkable than flattering to tho American people that, whenever any event occurs, or any enterprise is undertaken, in wetcli scientific improvements might be of value, numbers of inventors come forward with ."peer ilea lions off ring everything required tor the accomplishment of the de-ired purpose Ihus. when the Atlantic cable was talked of. numerous suggestions were made for tho laving of it. and when it broke hundreds publffhed plans, through the n-w.-papers, for remedying the disaster, ail of which were represented to be certain of success if afforded tho opportu nity of a triul. In like manner, a boiler ex plosion cannot take place in the city or on tho river without scientific remedies being pro posed against the recurrence of such acci dents, nor ? collision at sea without new in ventions or improvements in steering goer, lights and other nppl'nneos. It is the same wiilt I he present war; and we publish in another column a Est of pa tents which have b?cn taken out since its commencement for now inventions or improvements in implements of war und other army requisites.
