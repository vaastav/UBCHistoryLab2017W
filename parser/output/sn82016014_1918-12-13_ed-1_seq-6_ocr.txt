STOREHOUSE TO FRONT Once More I-oyal Sauta Fc Employes 81 low True Colors. The Red Cross campaign commit tee's appeal to the merchants and business men of Topeka to back the Christmas Roll Call campaign thru the purchase of display advertising bore fruit in unexpected quarters.

One page appears in the State Jour nal today. More than that, too, the employes of the storehouse also raised a snug sum to be used in buying Red Cross memberships for those persons in To peka who will be unable to pay for their own. This subscription to the advertising fund for the Red Cross Christmas Roll Call campaign is characteristic of the attitude the employes of the store house have shown in the various war campaigns in Topeka.
