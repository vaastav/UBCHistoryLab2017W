NEID or HELPING THE POOR. The saddest feature of the existing de pression in copper as far as Butte is concerned is the distressed condition of many poor families, which is aggravated (by the severity of the weather. For the next 60 days many of these unfortunates will suffer great hardships unless some systematic effort shall be made to relieve them. Every man and woman in Butte in v moderate circumstances can con tribute something in the way of clothing, (bedding or fuel to the deserving poor. Very few people are aware of the num ber of destitute persons in Butte and vicinity. The Paul Clark soup chariti es a great boon to many. The work of the Associated Charities is also accom plishing much good. It is hardlj fair, ■however, to expect the Clark family and the ladies of the charity association to assume the entire burden of public relief. The contributors should be numbered by the thousand and should comprise every man and woman who can afford to help in the good work. There are hundreds of cases now in the city which call for immediate aid. Cold and sickness can no* be relieved by food alone. Clothes, blankets, fuel, and in some eases careful nursing* are required. Some of the most pitiful cases are the most deserving, as ■pride sometimes prevent* the disclosure of the truth as to some families. In one case on West Granite street four small children are down with diphtheria, the (head of the family can get no work, his wife is exhausted by ceaseless vigi lance. and the landlord has served the family with a notice to move because of non-payment of rent. That is ihut one case of many in various parts of the city. Much of the distress may be relieved by sending money and clothing to the As sociated Charities without delay. The good women in charge of it will see that every dollar and every piece of clothing shall be properly distributed^ As Butte is now entering upon the holiday season, let it not be said that a single deserving family In the^ity is. any longer in need of the necessaries of life. PEACE ON EARTH. The workingmen of the United States have discussed with both pride and pleasure the declarations of Lite president in his annual message about the organi zation of labor on a fraternal basis, and the need and tendency of the times to a 'better understanding among men for the solution of the problems of life. In one place the president used this language: The rule of brotherhood remains as the Indispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for which we must strive. The above moves a writer 'in the New York Tribune to recall the history of the efforts made in recent times to bring humanity together to the end that wis dom and good fellowship may rule, and strife and trouble be no more. The Trib une correspondent writes: The president here sums up, in his terse and forceful way, the. principle which has been gradually evolving and taking shape since Lincoln day of Uiis year. On that day, in an address before the Massachusetts legislature, Senator George F. Hoar expressed his conviction that the Golden Rule is the only basis for a stable and permanent civilization. Acting upon this suggestion, the mana gers of the Baron and Baroness de Hirsch Monument association, which was formed for the purpuse of honoring the spirit of the Golden Rule as exem plified Iby those two philanthropists, called a meeting for discussing the pre cept. It was held in Calvary Baptist church (the Rev. R. S. MaoArthur's), and the Golden Rule was discussed by a Confucian (the Hon. VVu Ting Fang), by two Jewish rabbis and by Christians of different shades of faith. Two practical steps were unanimously agreed upon by the vast audience there assembled—(1) to organize a permanent Geldern Rule brotherhood (which was done a few weeks later) and (2) to recommend an annual Golden Rule day, not only in America but throughout the world. This •idea was formally promulgated from a representative meeting held in connec tion with the Pan-Aniericîn exposition at Buffalo. It was also emphasized by the remarkable Golden Rule spirit man ifested by President McKinley, who, as stated in Mr. Roosevelt's message, "even in mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness for his murderer, of love for his friends and of unfaltering trust in the will of the Most High." It is darkly hinted that the wreck on the Great Northern near Essex yeste ray morning was caused by some on* 'murderously inclined, who tampered with the rails. Should investigation prove that these suspicions have a foundation in fact those responsible for the erimo should be given the extreme penalty of the law. AH told, 19 persons were in jured and one man was killed. It is hard to find a punishment commensurate with such an offense, and should the guilty persons be apprehended, retribu tion cannot be too swift. j I j I j I j ! ; 1 j j i I j j • ' .

SUGAR TARIFE. A Washington dispatch, referring to the probability of a reciprocal arrange ment with Cuba providing for tbe free importation of Cuban sugar into the United States, says: It is not proposed to take the protec tion off beet sugar. The proposition con cerns itself solely with the problem of how best to promote the interests of Cuba without interfering in any way with domestic enterprises. Nearly the entire crop of Cuban sugar is now mar keted in the United States without hurt to the beet root industry. A reduction of the present tariff would not so mate rially increase importations from Cuba as to drive the beet sugar men out of business. No; it might not drive the beet sugat men out of business, but it might drive j their reasonable profits out of existence. The beet sugar men and the Louisiana sugar men need something besides a bare living. If the problem is "how best to promote the interests of Cuba with out interfering in any way with domestic enterprises" the best thing to do is to leave the tariff as it is, for no reduction can be made without interfering to some extent with a home industry that needs protection. Fince the experiments made last summer in the Bitter Root valley, showing the adaptability of the soil to lieet culture, Montana will soon take a lively interest in the question of free sugar and will demand that the present tariff be let alone until experience shall demonstrate to what extent the home sugar industry can survive a reduction of the duties. THE 

OBJECTING HALF DOZEN. Yesterday in the senate of the United States the Hay-Pauncefote treaty was ratified 'by an overwhelming majority vote. This was not unexpected. It was certain that the treaty would go through. Quite generally, it was con ceded that the delay in '.bringing the matter to a vote meant nothing more j than the usual precaution taken by the I senate to prevent that dignified body being thrown off its balance by hasty action. Six senators voted against ratification. A precious half dozen was all that re mained of the formidable array which had blocked progress toward the time when work might begin on the isthmian waterway. The roll of belligerents in- j eluded Bacon. Blackburn, Culberson, I Mallory, Teller and Tillman. Each of i the senators who voted against ratifica- ! tion spoke briefly or at length to give: evidence of the faith within him. What ; they said shed no light on the situation. : Their foreboding threw no wet blankets J on the ebullient patriotism of those who j favored the treaty. It went through j with a rush, carried over the 'heads of j the half dozen who directed a scattering ! hostile fire at the measure. I Taking account of the twists and turns ] made by the contingent which has all along opposed the treaty, there is no little satisfaction in yesterday's ballot ing. When the first treaty with refer ence to the isthmian canal was sent to j congress a perfect whirlwind of opposi tion arose. It was believed by congres sional malcontents that the Clayton Bulwer treaty would stand. Acting upon this belief, opponents of the measure showed their hands. They wanted a canal that in its building, operation, control and protection should 'be exclu sively our own. A canal without the aid or consent of any nation on earth would be just the thing, said they. So without warning and in an evil day for the minority the 'old treaty was abrogated and the new one put in its stead. The maneuver knocked the pins from under most of the opponents of the treaty. A few were moved to confess frankly that they had been given all they asked and j were satisfied. Not so with Bacon et al. I They had cried for the moon, and when j the shining luminary was handed them I they still had a kick coming. Committed j to a dog-in-the-manger policy, they re ! fused to be comforted. They measure up pretty small today in the estimation ; of the public. The tide of events has 1 swamped them, and the solemn senate j has to hold its sides so funny are the j antics of these members who are in too i deep water in the isthmian canal ques tion. ___________ I In the New York Sun of the 12th inst. is a paid communication from the facile and erratic pen of Thomas W. Lawson ! of Boston. Mr. Lawson seems to be no! j friend of the Amalgamated, and accuses 1 j its chiefs of a Christian desire of setting! him afoot without a dollar in the world. ' • However, he declines to be deprived of ; his hard-earned fortune, and explains in: the Sun why, unlike the Amalgamated stock, his spirits are not depressed. The i Inter Mountain today publishes a portion of tbe Lawson communication, not be cause it can guarantee the accuracy of: its statements, but because it contains information of decided interest and which! ' might come under the head of "impôt* 1 tain if true." If Mr. Lawson is right theti is ground for hope that the gieat copper j struggle will soon be ended, and that as; soon as the surplus shall decrease pro- ' duction will be resumed on the old or' a larger scale. In one part of his letter . Mr. Lawson points out that the most I I Intimate business associates and eo- ! j I partners of the Amalgamated people are' ' the largest holders of the stock, and that : any permanent depreciation of its value, is improbable, as only ihe insiders would be the sufferers. . It is possible, however, that Mr. Law- 1 I son overlooks the main causes of the de- 1 pression as far as Butte interests are ; concerned. Every Intelligent man in I Butte understands hotv necessary it is I that the price of copper should be main, i tained, for nothing is more certain, as' explained in a recent 'interview with! j Mr. ('. IV. Clark, than the disastrous re- 1 j suits of low copper. The men who con-j I ] 1 ; i 1 trol the surplus control also most of the great producing mines of Butte. Their interests and Butte's interests require that copper be upheld and the mines op erated in order that the market may be steady and that dividends be regularly paid. The enemies of tfiose people are attacking them by every dishonorable means at their command, for private ends. They circulate infamous reports, setting forth that the mines are exhaust ed: that they are on fire; that they are flooded; that they are mismanaged: tbxt they are over-capitalized; that the courts will close them down; that the smelter will never start: that $100 will place any of them in the hands of a receiver; that the people of Butte want them shut down and their owners banished. These stories are repeated every day and new ones started. The only purpose is ito smash the market and break down the Amalgamated. The only result, unless offset, will be the severe injury '-Of Butte's labor and business interests and the exclusion of new capital from the state. While the enemies of Butte are, in the East, abusing the Amal gamated for trying to keep stock up, they are in the West abusing it for let ting it down. In one breath they de nounce the company for the depreciation of stock, and in the next they swear till they are black in the face that the stock is worthless and the mines played out and the business men and workingmen of Butte ready to leave. Mr. Lawson ought to know every cause contributing to the depression in the copper market. He must know that the interests of the Amalgamated, its employes and the com munity are identical and in favor of high prices and steady operation, while, its enemies care nothing either for its em ployes or the community so long as they can by corruption and misrepresen tation achieve their personal objects. Some day the people of Montana may take a hand in the game. Upon the question of ratifying the Hay-Pauncefote treaty in the senate yesterday, Senators Clark and Gibson voted aye. In so doing they reflected the sentiment of their Montana con stituents. The treaty is fair and liberal in its provisions and gives the United States practically absolute control over the canal and its approaches. The Brit ish government in conceding every Amer ican demand gave additional assurance of a friendly feeling towards the Amer ican people. That feeling began When, during the early days of the Spanish war, Great Britain notified the Conti nental powers that it would refuse to join in any display of naval force -, in American waters on behalf of Spain. Great Britain not only declared its own neutrality, but plainly 'hinted that the other great powers would better follow suit. Any attack on the legitimate mining enterprises of Montana is an attack upon the people of Montana. Any assertion that any productive mine in Butte is over-capitalized is an attack on the mining industry of Butte, the men engaged in that industry and the busi ness which it supports. Any claim of friendship for the work ingmen followed by an effort to close down the mines in which euch working men are employed, does not beguile any of them. Marconi's systebi of wireless telegra phy was given a test recently which should remove all doubts concerning the practical features of this means of com munication. Two ships at sea, 100 miles apart, held converse across the waves by wireless telegraphy, sending and re ceiving messages with apparently the same cerainty and ease that attend communication 'by the usual mode of telegraphy. This invention is a long step in advance on the road science is traveling. Before the present century is far advanced Marconi's system will no doubt be in general use. It is the so far recorded. Marconi has set the pace for inventors of the present age. I greatest triumph of electrical science | The prisoner who recently attemptei to escape from the county jail will be closely guarded until he is landed be hind the bars at Deer Lodge. He took a long chance in the attempt to force the bars of his cell. Other prisoners joined him in. the undertaking, and only by rare good fortune was a Wholesale jai! delivery prevented. The officers should spare no effort to apprehend the persons on the outside who furnished the ! tools used in the job and an example ' should be made of the guilty parties. Riders in the six-day bicycle cham pionship race in New York find the con test a test of endurance rather than of speed. Most of the riders are showing bad effects from the terrific strain to which they are being subjected. It is , not unlikely that serious consequences may overtake the speedy'cyclists befort^ their six-day spin is ended. The men who would knock down a mining stock and then abuse its owners for not keeping it up are not shining ex amples of the virtue of consistency. The same may be said of men who hypo critically advocate a high price for cop per in one breath and in the next foully abuse the very men who are trying to keep it up. Hundreds of honest and hard-working men in Butte are the holders of copper mining shares. It is to their interest that the price of copper be maintained. The enemies of Butte who are trying to smash 'both copper shares and the cop per market can ho longe)" deceive the copper shareholders with crocodile tears. The ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty yesterday was the best piece of work of the Sess'un. Chicago anarchists have addressed an open letter to President Roosevelt, in which they breathe defiance and sound a note of warning. Without ceremony or loss of time congress should send an answer in the form of a bill penalizing resident anarchists and debarring others from the country. Grand Duke Michael oT Russia Is in Germany on a hunting trip, and was met by Emperor William, who kissed him warmly. The reception was so ex cessively cordial that a suspicion exists that the kiss was thrown in diplomat ically to cover up a very different feel Oniinous tidings come from the home of Mrs. McKinley, telling of the gradual but certain decline of her health. General grieving will follow should the invalid fail to rally. The widow of the late president is held more firmly in the af fections of the people than ever before. A Joint resolution by Senator Jones came before the senate yesterday pro posing thanks to Admiral Schley. Had the proposal been to the country at large to give three cheers for the admiral, the action taken would doubtless have been prompt and unanimous. Immigration during the past year was 112 per cent greater than In 1899. The illiterate portion of the immigration numbered 117,645, and 3879 were returned to their native countries, debarred for various reasons from becoming resi dents. The finance committee of the city council which stood off a couple of plumbing bills and cut the charges in two will confer another and greater favor by explaining to a long-suffering public just how the trick is done. A number of Eastern educators have caused President Roosevelt's message to be read in the schools over which they preside. Singularly enough, nearly all who paid this high compliment to the message are democrats. The report of the Schley inquiry board lias left partisans of both sides of the controversy hopelessly at sea. For the good of all concerned, the matter should be considered a closed incident. Notwithstanding the recent flurry in medical circles over attacks of lockjaw caused 'by impure anti-toxine, the life saving serum is daily scoring new tri umphs over diphtheria. Foreign nations who complain at th advances made in American commerce will find that a disposition to get out and hustle beats the system of complain ing several to one. Santos Dumont's balloon broke loose the other day and went skyward. The fact that the inventor wasn't in the aerial craft proves that he has luck as well as genius. The price of grain has gone balloon ing. It is no speculative price, either) it s the real thing, and the ■delights of dollar wheat are now plentifully dis tributed. Galveston, Texas, has failed to pay the interest on its municipal bonds. The storm which wrecked the city seems to have disturbed its financial foundations. Dueling has been condemned In Aus tria and there is a prospect of a revival of the ancient and honorable practice of fighting it out by hand. The flying machine and wireless teleg raphy are inventions which will 'be in common use before many years. Object to Reorganization. (By Associated Press.)
