Swineford, of Alaska, Makes Complaint Against a California Corporation. Washington, Dec. 6.— A. P. Swine ford, governor of Alaska, in a letter to the secretary of the Interior, represents that through what he believes to have been, to say the least, an absurd de cision of the late judge of the United States court for Alaska, private parties have secured possession and control of the government wharf at Sitka, and now monopolize the coal trade. He says that the vessels of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company refuse to land at all for anybody but the parties who are in possession of the wharf; and they, in consequence, are able to extort exor bitant prices. The governor asks that the senior naval officer stationed there be authorized to supply the civil author ities with coal at cost price. The letter has been referred to the navy depart ment. ■ ■ - - "LOUIS RIEL'S NATIVITY. Senator Blair Seeks to Have It In- vestigated by Congress.

Bryant, a Nebraska law yer, concerning the nativity of Louis Kiel, whose execution by the Canadian government for leading the Indians in their revolt against the white settlers of Cauda, Mr. Blair seeks to have investi gated by congress.- It was claimed at the time of Kiel's execution that he was an Indian and therefore not entitled to the protection of this govevnment, since his naturalization in Montana was ob tained under ' falso representations. Mr. Bryant says that Kiel's mother was a white woman and that his father was descended from a half-breed. He says that Kiel was seven-eighths white and one-eighth Indian. SENATORIAL SQUABBLES. Grave and Reverend Scignors Discuss That Ancient Chestnut, the Tariff. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 6.— the senate to-day the discussion of the tariff bill was continued. A communication from the secretary of state, with a certified copy of the final ascertainment of the presidential electors in Kansas, was pre sented. The presiding officer asked the opinion of the senate (this being an en tirely new proceeding) as to the disposi tion to be made of the papers. Mr. Sherman moved to refer tiie papers to the committee on privileges and elec tions, and called attention to the nov elty of the proceeding. He expressed his opinion that the proceeding (if not an in fringement ot the constitution) was extra-constitutional. After some dis cussion the papers were referred to the committee on privileges and elections. The resolution for continuing the select committees on the meat products and on the relations with Canada were reDorted back from the committee on contingent expenses and adopted with amendments. Mr. Plumb gave notice that he would at an early day ask the senate to consider the Des Moines river lands bill. The sen ate at 1:05 resumed the consideration of the tariff bill, beginning with Schedule B, which covers earthenware and glass ware. Discussion was continued by Senators Allison, Aldrich, Harris, Hoar, Butler. McPherson. Plumb and Payne, but no vote was taken on the pending amendments, and the bill was laid aside, the progress during the clay be ing about eighty pages.

The senate then, at '6 o'clock, adjourned till Monday. Longs for Private Life. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 6.— The residence of Hon.* Edmund Rice is one of the finest In this city, and it is beautifully located, too. The genial and entertain ing member from the Fourth district seems more and more contented with his retirement from public life as the days go by. He congratulates himself upon the speedy cessation of his public ■work and says: "1 long for private life again. 1 am too old for this turmoil, aiid I am more than glad that the busy j time of my term is already past." He is receiving many flattering attentions from members and senators who have learned that tho home of Mr. Rice is the fountain " of genuine Western hospi tality. J 

DROPPED FROM THE ROLLS. Hon. Perry Belmont Is No Longer a Member of Congress. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 6.— The house to day began the discussion of the direct tax bill. The order relative to the con sideration of the bill was so modified as to make the measure a special order for to-day, Tuesday and Wednesday, it being the desire of many members that an adjournment be taken over Saturday. The clerk was directed to drop Mr. Bel mont's name from the roll of the house. The usual resolution for the distribu tion of the president's message to the appropriate committees was reported from the committee on ways and means by Mr. McMillin, of Tennessee, and adopted. An effort was "made to reach some agreement touching the offering and pendancy of amendments to the direct tax bill, but it proved futile. After a long debate on the bill the com mittee rose.. Mr, Clements, of Georgia, from the committee on appropriations, reported the District of Columbia appro priation bill, which was referred to the committee of the whole. The house at 3:30 adjourned. Nelson and Haugen. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. There is nothing pending of special interest to Minnesota which is likely to secure i early action in either house. The Red Lake bill is still hanging fire in the senate, and it is likely to remain in statu quo until after the holidays. The bridge bills which excited controversy between Congressmen Nelson and Haugen will die in committee. There is no likeli- . hood that either of them will pass dur ing the present session. Mr. Haugen declares that he is as determined as ever that Nelson's bill for the bridge over the canal entrance to Duluth harbor shall not pass, and Nelson is as deter mined that the bridge across the Missis sippi river at Alma, Wis., shall not pass. Neither will give way, and present indi cations point to a resumption of their cat and mouse watch of each other during this session. Kleiner's Mission. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. John P. Kleiner, of Pierre, Dak., arrived here to-day and is registered at tbe National hotel. He visited the Indian office, saw the commissioner and superintendent of Indian affairs concerning the Pierre Indian school, and then went to the capitol and saw Knute Nelson, Chair man Peel and many others about di vision and admission. He will remain here a week, then go to New York, and return here about the 20th en route for home. He believes the new Sioux reservation bill will pass both houses without the submission clause. Dr. Bland, the long-haired friend of the Indian, is now laboring for a bill giving the Indians §1 an acre, but requiring their consent. Peel and Dames are both inclined to ignore the Indians in the matter. Bland will not likely accom plish anything. The Penalties of Office. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. MinLesota does not stand alone in the matter of officeseekers, but her senators and Re publican representatives-elect are load ed down with petitions and letters ask ing for influence to obtain positions now held by the faithful and non-elect. Personal experience warrants tlie pre diction that during the winter each one of those gentlemen will receive but little less than a ton of mail from those who seek fourth-class postoffices alone. Day's New Partner. ;. Special to the Globe. Washington, D. C, Dec. 6. -Hon. W. Duff Haynie, chief clerk of the first as sistant postmaster general, returned to day from Deadwood, where he formed a partnership with M. H. Day. Mr. Haynie is an Illinois man and was never in Dakota before. He will resign his office here about the middle of January and go to Deadwood to live. He is an acquisition to that community and to the territory, being an able, popular and honorable man. Springer's Sentiments. Special to the Globe. Washington, D. C, Dec. Con gressman Springer says he i hopes to call up his omnibus bill next Wednes day. He is willing to accept reason able amendments. Blerly and others believe Springer will accept the Mac- Donald substitute for admission of two Dakotas.

Christian Zilner, also a German, twenty-seven years old, shot himself iu the stomach and cannot live. Pierre Soulon, a Frenchman, forty- five years old, cut an artery. He was taker* to St. Vincent's hospital a pris- oner. A woman, whom no one knew, put up day before yesterday at the Grand Union hotel. To-day she shot herself, and is now dying at Bellevue hospital. She is unconscious, and death will probably soon seal her lips for good. .If;;'.; CHIEF OP THE DYNAMITARDS. Informer Bowles Proceeds to Swear Bauereisen Into Prison. Geneva, 111., Dec. 6.— In the trial of John H. Bauereisen, chief of the al- leged Burlington . dynamiter conspir- ators, the jury panel was completed to- day. John Alexander Bowles, who, it is said, was a conspirator and one of the squealers, was put on the stand as the first and most important witness/Bowles testified that he went to work as an en- gineer for the Burlington, March 22, 1888, and was persuaded to quit by his brother April 4. He joined the Broth- erhood, and was employed by Bauereisen to buy dynamite and place it on the tracks, and also to buy vitriol and am- monia to put in the water-tanks and dose engines. The witness told how, two weeks after his initiation as a brotherhood man, he met Bauereisen at Aurora, and how the latter told him that dynamite could now be used with good effect, giving him $7.50 to buy the stuff. Bowles said he could not purchase it in Chicago in small quantities, but suc- ceeded in doing so at Noblesvilie, Ind., where he obtained these sticks. Re- turning to Chicago he met Bauereisen, Doge, Kelly and the other leading strikers at the grievance committee room at the Grand Pacific. Bauereisen said the witness gave him .0, and told him to go to Galesburg with the "goods." Bowles then related how cordially he was received by George A. Clark there, to whom Bauereisen had written a letter EXPLAINING THE PLOT. They drove to the Burlington tracks but were afraid to use the explosives. He and Clark buried the dynamite near the water woods, and Bowles returned Aurora to have another talk with Bau- ereisen. Bauereisen furnished more money and a trip was taken by witness to Noblesvilie and Westfield, Ind, when more dynamite, besides fulminating caps and fuse, were purchased, "May 16" continued Bowles, "Bauereisen, gave me two silver dollars to hire a rig and visit the 'Q' tracks. I took Alex Smith with me, and drove to the rail- road crossing near the fair grounds, where I placed a stick of dynamite with fulminating cap on the track. We drove back to Aurora and heard the ex- plosion a mile away. The next morn- ing Bauereisen said it was a good job and that the flange had been blown off the leading truck wheel." The witness next described how he and Bauereisen and Smith experiemented with a slow fuse in the consultation room of the division hall at Aurora. After these experiements, Bauereisen wanted Smith and Bowles to put dynamite under a "scab " boarding house known as the Council house and blow it to atoms. They refused, saying it would be mur- der. Taking a third" trip to Noblesvilie he BOTJGnT MOKE DYNAMITE, which he took to Clark at Galesburg. Making another trip to Indiana, he told how Bauereisen sent him a check for $15 and a letter, which he had destroyed, but the contents of which were to the effect to "hurry up and get to Creston (Iowa); take plenty of goods with you: I have written Broderick to meet you ; if you come this way (Aurora) J. J. Kelly and I would like to buy some "goods' from you." Another letter giving ad- vice that Bowles, concerning Pinkerton detectiues, who, it was supposed, were shadowing him, was introduced. In that the advice was to shoot the sleuth hounds. After detailing the arrest of Broderick and himself, and before the witness had concluded, Judge Wilson adjourned court for the day. MISSING PAPER MONEY. Ten Sheets of Unstamped Legal Tenders Disappear Proms- the Treasury Department. Washington, Dec. 6.— Another ir- regularity has been discovered in the treasury department arising from the mysterious disappearance of ten uncut sheets of legal tenders, each containing four notes of the denomination of $5, and representing $200 in all. These sheets were included in the regular de- livery from the bureau of engraving and printing to the United States treasurer fast Tuesday morning. The packages were counted and reported to be correct in every particular before leaving the bureau. On reaching the " treasurer's office they were again counted and re- ported correct. The notes are all com- pleted with the exception of being stamped with the treasury seal, and when - that is added they are ready for issue. After the packages in ques- tion had been verified at the treasurer's office they wers turned over to the seal- ing division for completion. They were counted there and found to be short ten I sheets. These were numbered In regu- lar order and ? were in the middle of a package. The officer in charge of the division refused to receipt for these sheets and word was sent to the bii'^nll for an explanation. A thoro-* Y^--t,Tye„ ligation was instir,- .a> ainpalthough ?rtnc __ Jnsti^a. two uajs nas no trace whatever. I ot tne, missing sheets has been discov 1 e_d. While it is possible that the sheets were mislaid aud may be recov ered, it is more than probable they were; abstracted by some one familiar with the method of handling . them. The : notes will readily pass* for money, for they lack only the treasury seal. ' WHITE CAPS' WARNING.

Lima, Ohio, Dec. 6.— Quite a sensa tion was caused in this place to-day by the serving of notices on all houses of ill-repute, by a band styling themselves the Northwestern .

Some credence is placed in the genuineness of , the notice, because at Ada, a small place near here, the White Caps first commenced operations in this state. ' i ]jy. RICKETY WALLS COLLAPSE. RICKETY WALLS COLLAPSE. Diehl's Malt House in Buffalo Goes to Pieces, One Employe Losing His Life. Special to the Globe. .'■ *-• ' Buffalo, N. Y., Dec. 6— loud crash followed by a thundering roar of falling walls alarmed the citizens liv ing in the vicinity of Niagara and Mary- land streets at 3 p. m. to-day. People rushed to the scene, and were horrified to see terrified workmen of Diehl's malt house rushing from the huge brick building on the corner. The brick walls had fallen in, and it was hard to tell how many people were buried. The falling of the walls was accompanied by the breaking down of six big iron malting tanks. In four of the tanks were thousands of bushels ot barley soaking for malting. The grain and water began to pour out in rivers, and in an incredibly short" space : of time Niagara street for some distance was of a dirty yellowish color. The frighted workmen endeavored to find out who was missing. Fortunately the i number was small. Flod Meyer, a maltster.and Stephen Anse were all that were found to be missing. After sev- . eral minutes had been spent in digging out the debris, Anse crawled out of the ruins covered with malt, plaster and dirt. A few minutes later he told a; re- porter he was skimming a vat on the sixth floor, when he suddenly heard a . terrible crash. The tank which he was skimming began to fall downward, and he held on for dear life. He went down until he lost his senses. The first thing. he knew was when he was pulled out. * A search was made for Meyer, who was; working on the same "floor, but in spite of the work done by the fire depart-; ment, who removed tons of malt and-: debris, he could not be found. He must: have gone to the bottom of the build- ing. There were 100,000 bushels of. malt on the top floor alone. To-day was the first time the malting operations were started, and the* conveying- of large quantities of water to the upper floors possibly caused the collapse. No estimate of the loss can be given at present, but it will be large. It is stated the building was in a very unsafe con- dition. : , *. '•■ .. ■■ * '-y y ...A'' LIKE POOR LAZARUS.

Garfield, Cap- tain Holte, arrived from Nevassa with the crew of the schooner Albert H. Cross, which was abandoned Nov. 30 in a sinking condition. The wrecked schooner, with a crew of five seamen and a cook, left Charleston Nov. 15 for Petersburg, Va. On the 18th the wind : blew a gale from the northeast and split the fore sails. On the 25th heavy waves swept away her boats and to add to the terrible situation the vessel sprang a leak. The men were lashed to the pumps and for five days battledwith the sea for their lives. The seamen were covered with salt water sores and every movement of their body gave them pain. The schooner was settling rap idly and hope was fast giving way. _ On Nov. 30 the captain saw the schooner could float but a few hours longer. Shortly before noon the schooner Gar field hove in sight and answered their signals of distress, and, although the sea was very rough, succeeded in trans ferring the shipwrecked crew, who were in a wretched condition. . y':_7 v"* .
