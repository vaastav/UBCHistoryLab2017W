Joseph Ffifer. living near Ne braska City was accidentally shot by her 16-year-old son Joseph Tuesday of Isst week, and died almost instantly. The boy fired a charge of heavy shot at a rabbit that had taken refuge under a corn crib ignorant of the fact that his mother was standing on the opposite aide of the crib. Two shot took effect in her temple. The press of this country in the main, "stands for honesty and efficiency in gov ernment and administration; for purity in politics; for justice, mercy, liberty, humanity, and loyalty to country. If there are any nowspapers recreant to these high ideals, such are compelled to simulate, at least, the appearance of the virtues that they do not possess. This condition exists because the men back of the newspapers, like Americans in all the other legitimate callings of life, are true to these grand principles that are the foundation stones and enter into the whole auperstruction of our free govern mentthis mighty temple of liberty, of individual rights and responsibilities. Oulbertson Era. ANOTHER FOP GONE WRONG. A Jadas Iscariot ia Complexion aad Pria ciple. Editor Jodbnax: I see by the Argus that Mr. Brindley's memory is a little defective, as he claims that he has known me for 30 years, and that I used to be a Jacksonian democrat. My memory reverts to 1871, when I became a voter, and I am proud to say that I cast 'a republican vote in 1871 and continually since that time. I well remember how many times I have been a delegate to the republican conventions in Polk county. I have often talked with Bra Brindlev and looked in his face with pity, to think bow his mind would rattle around in his cranium like a buck-shot in a tin wash boiler. He claims that I have always been a champion for the poor, the wronged and the oppressed. I admit that I am sympathetic with those who are cast out upon the cold charities of an unfriendly world. I think Bra. Brindley is a well-mean-ins; man and does not seek to do a fellow man an injustice, but there is a sort of a Jadas Iscariot, silver principle about hint that I really wish he would get rid of. I think he ought to take something for that pop doctrine which he advocates aad get the knot on his neck straight ened out. I think the warm congenial climate of the Philippines would be ben eftetal to him, and I would make a motion that we start the ball rolling in Platte coaaty and never let np until we have landed every pop in America safely on the sunny islands of the Philippines.

The joist peace com mirm was in session for over four hoars. Much of the discussion con cerned details as to the guaranteeing of the rights of Spanish citisens in the ceded colonies. The debate was occa sionally energetic, and the Spaniards, on adjourning, appeared to be dejected. Secretary Ojeda of the Spanish com mission, when questioned after the meeting as to the progress made, said, excitedly: "I am almost mad. I cannot iir We are making progress." The American commissioners declined so say anything farther than the prog ress was satisfactory. The history of the document, which will certify the passing of the oldest co lonial power in the world, and the ad ntif til nw- na signalized in a single sentence, "A peace treaty can !Tuil ;JuZir.trm nat: into lything which victors pat inro contain an; it" The -i" listened for hours with their customary patience to the technicalities convoked by the Span iards with their customary shrewdness and persistency against proposals mak ing for the dismemberment of their em pire. Darkness had come on, and Sen ator Irye, whose unconcealed contempt for diplomatic quibblings excites the amaiement of the Caatillians, had talked out, his patience exhausted. The burden of the Spanish arguments was that matters outside the bare oes -i. mmA evacuation or me Bpamsn ter ritory, which the Americans proposed to cover by the treaty, were beyond the legitimate and customary scope of a peace treaty. Behind this bulwark Senor Montero Bios, presi dent of the Spanish commission, forti fied himself, bombarding bis opponents with a supply of arguments and prece dents wWcfi inspired the freely ex pressed admiration of ti Americans. SlaaUy Judge Day aummariaed the America position in the foregoing memorable utterance. It was given and taken is good spirit and from that moment the proceedings were entirely friendly. The session accomplished much. Eight open questions were canvassed, seven being practically set tled without noteworthy friction. The commissioners decline to say what con clusion was reached, but the bargain for a coaling station in the Oarolinea was not cemented and according to areaent prospects, it is likely to fail.

Mr. Quesada, speaking for the commission, aid: "The president's message is re garded as very satisfactory. Its publi cation at this time will do good, coun teracting reports that have been spread in Cuba by people who have not the real interests of the country at heart. ' We have full faith in the United States and in the just intentions of President McKinley , and the men who have made the revolution of Cuba aim to work with the United States to establish a government that will have the respect of nations. General Garcia is well satisfied with the interviews he has had with American officials. The infonaa-. tion he is giving and gathering will aid greatly in the work of regeneration we have in hand." Spain SaetaJag WJtatSedlttoa. Lokdox, Dec. G. The rris corre spondent of the Daily Telegraph says: "According to trustworthy news from Madrid, Spain is seething with sedition, born of bankruptcy and ruin. One of the best informed men in the kingdom assures me that the chances of a revolu tion are increasing by leaps and bounds. Carlism exists in three provinces only, but the disaffection toward the present government is co-extensive with the en tire Spanish race."

It is noticeable that representatives of the beet sugar industry are herein num bera, and it is more than likely that the probable effect on that branch of farm ing by the ajuuxation of the Phihppines will be one of the moat exciting qnes tioas to claim the attention of the con- lowaiand Colorado have the here, but all the valley is wall reun ited.
