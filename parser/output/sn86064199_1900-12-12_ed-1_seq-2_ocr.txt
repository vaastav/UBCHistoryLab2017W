The Herald has often laid stress on the importance of teaching the young how to express themselves, in speech and in writing, in clear, forcible Eng lish. Spelling and the construction of sentences are not the only things to be looked after; punctuation, though often looked upon as of secondary im portance, is as much a part of correct knowledge as spelling. It is unfortu nate that the carelessness or ignorance of teachers should be excused, as it has been since the system of public education began, by saying that "every one punctuates to suit himself," and: "that there are no general rules to be followed. Everyone has heard this statement made by those that ought to know better and probably do know better. It is simply an indication of a slipshod intellect. There are rules in punctuation as there are in spelling. It is true that some variation is allowed in their appplication, but there are cer tain uses of punctuation marks that are firmly settled in correct usage. It is these rules that should be taught children and compliance with which should be insisted upon. Nowhere do we find more evidence of slipshod punctuation and actual ignorance of the fundamental rules than in the statutes as passed by the average state legislature. The higher courts are constantly being called on to in terpret the meaning of some law that is obscure because of the wrong use of a comma or a semicolon. Money loss es on account of such blunders have been tremendous, and much embar rassment has often resulted from mis understandings so caused. The state of Massachusetts is just now all stirred up over a case of faulty punctuation, wherein, through error, an exception is made in the operation of a liquor law that is objectionable to the tem perance element, and at the same time a hardship is worked upon hotel keepers that was never intended. The error might look insignificant enough to the average legislator merely the putting of a semicolon where a com ma ought to be but. it has already caused much litigation and rancorous controversy, and the end is not yet Faulty construction of laws is a great evil, and this little matter of punc tuation has as much to do with the errors that are made as has the use of words. In business life, too, grave cnuerences often arise through the mispunctuation of orders for goods or specifications in contracts. Mis takes of this sort are simply the results of carelessness, and every effort should be made in the schools to train tne children in these things so there will be less cause for embarrassment in future. o The president in his annual message to congress expresses pardonable grat ification upon the fact that the policy of the United States In China has come to be recogrized as the best by all the powers. Even Germany, re luctantly enough, has gradually ac quiesced in our view, at least to the extent of modifying her original de mands. There are some jingo papers in this country that are continually nagging the administration because it will not take the lead in calling for the wholesale butchery of Chinese leaders and even the deposition of the reign ing dynasty. Strangely enough, the most bloodthirsty demands have come from the church people, the friends of the Christian missions, in a spirit mat little accords with the teachings of the master. The attitude of the United States was assumed in the face of the most trying circumstances, in the face of fierce opposition, in the face of for eign protests, and yet it has been right from the first and is right now. The jingos know little or nothing of the real conditions in China, they are staking nothing, they have no respon sibility, while on the president and his advisers in such a crisis as that through which we have been passing and are yet passing, in the orient, rests a burden the like of which these lesser men can never know. The deep est thinkers on Chinese problems now give their assent to the dictum of the vuneu States at the very beginning, that the integrity of the empire should be maintained and that any ne gotiations that might be entered upon should be carried on with the reigning Manchu rulers. From the first the Uni ted States has insisted that the Chin ese had rights as a nation that the world was bound to respect, and as The Herald has before pointed out, the United States has all through this Chinese muddle played the role of the conservator and peacemaker, greatly to the world's gain. o The Grout oleomargarine bill in de creasing the tax on uncolored oleo and increasing it on the product colored to imitate butter, is only working to pro tect the citizen from fraud. The bill as passed makes all articles known as oleomargarine, butterine, imitation butter or imitation cheese transport- eq- into any gtate or terruory for con- Sumntlon or sale sublect to the nolice power of such state or territory, but prevents any state or territory from forbidding the transportation or sale of such product when produced and sold free from coloration in imitation of butter. The bill increases the tax on oleomargarine colored in imitation of butter from 2 ,to 10 cents a pound and decreases the tax on oleomargar ine uncolored from 2 cents to one quar ter of a cent per pound. Oleomargar ine is a legitimate article of manufac ture and commerce except when it poses as cow butter. There is a decid ed sentiment against it and a pur chaser has a right to have what he wants and to know what he gets. Good oleomargarine Is undoubtedly better than bad butter, but bad oleomargar ine is much worse than bad butter and the best- oleomargarine is far from being as good as the best butter. The two are different articles in taste and effect and me United States ought to give the cow a perpetual right to the trade mark "butter" and other pro ducts should be forced to seek other names. o The paragraphers are having all kinds of spoit with the French general, Mcrcier, who" came into new promi nence the other day by making a lurid speech in the senate in which he show ed how easy it would be to invade Eng land. One writer admits the force of the general's contention, but hints that it might not be so' easy to get out again. Another refers to Weyler's ter rible typewriter, and intimates that Mercier's weapon is scarcely more for midable. o Emperor Wilhelm has enlivened his empire and the world by an efferves cence of his light, airy humor. His chancellor Count von Buelow recently remarked to the emperor that his grand palace needed cleaning and that the countess did not get at it. His emperor the next day sent a hundred pounds of soap to the count's palace for a good joke. It would be but a tame world for newspapers and na tions if it were not for Kaiser Billy. o The Kansas scnool book commission is investigating General Funston's knowledge of swimming. The new Kansas history for the schools says that Funston swam the Marlino river in the Philippines and captured pris oners. Now comes alone a Captain Hardy of tne 20th Kansas who says Funston can't swim an dthe books may have to be changed. The general impression is that Funston gets across the rivers somehow. o The newspapers are disputing whether "the courtesy of the senate" will be a complete antidote for Roose velt's strenuousness and many prophe- sy that our next vice president will lead a quiet, unassuming life. The "cour tesy of the senate" is something of a brake on the career of any idea but whether Roosevelt's rush and progress can be impeded, only time and trial can tell. Now is the season of sentimental deforestization when the mountain sides are robbed of the drooping pines and the trees are brought into the homes and decoratea with tinsel, can dles, and gifts to make a juvenile holi day. There are rumors that- the ship builders and armor plate and gun mak ers of America, France, Germany and England are to combine in a world trust of the' materials of war which if true, will put war more on the com mercial basis than ever. o If there be that secret alliance with Great Britain of which the Bryanites loved to talk during the campaign, the English newspapers are not in it, for they are extremely dissatisfied with McKinley's message. The criminations and recriminations between the British and Germans in China, with regard to looting, seem to be a repetition of the historical oc casion upon which the pot called the kettle black. Wanamaker's life insurance policies amount up to $2,250,000 and the moral is that it pays to advertise. Wana- maker asserts that by big advertising he secured his leadership and success o General Funston is heard from again, He has been plunging through more rivers and surprising and routing more Filipinos as dashingly and in trepidly as ever. o Roosevelt will take a holiday in January and go hunting mountain lions in Colorado and New Mexico, so as to be fresh and invigorated for the vice presidency. o The American plays for big stakes. In New York they play progressive euchre with grand pianos and auto mobiles as prizes. o The offer of Columbia University 'of New York to educate five Filipinos is practical philanthrophy. The czar advocates disarmament but goes right on increasing the Russian navy. o The Story of Oklahoma Frr m the G'ob-rininrrat. It is an absorbing tale which is told by Gov. Barnes in his annual report upon the condition of Oklahoma. As we know from the census returns, Ok lahoma has a population of 398,000, The governor tells us that the assessed valuation of her property in 1900 is, in round figures $49,000,000, an in crease of $6,000,000 over 1899, and within her limits there are still almost 6.000.000 acres of public lands subject to entry. The $49,000,000 of taxable valuation represents $135,000,000 of ac tual value of property. The products or her farms, mines and factories in the fiscal year aggregated $75,000,000, She has 100.000 children enrolled in her public schools, with 2.000 in the higher educational institutions. Here are a few of the material facts of the condition of Oklahoma. They furnish a powerful argument for her Immediate admission to statehood These are some of the superficial facts in connection with a locality which was not onened to settlement until 1889 and which was not organized into a territory until 1890. Uutil eleven years ago Oklahoma was virtually a vacant spot on the map. Eager pio neers had been peering into Oklaho ma for years before 1889. and some of them Payne. Couch and many oth erscrossed its boundaries and estab lished settlements in it. but they were ousted by the United States troops. and it was made practically vacant land, as before.A minute before noon of April 22. 1889. the instant of the opening, there was not a single in habitant in Oklahoma. It contained 50.000 inhabitants by sundown on that day. Such a deluge had never been seen before since the world be gan. One of the most remarkable feat ures of Oklahoma's growth is its sym metry and solidity. At 2 o'clock on the afternoon of that opening day a bank with $50,000 capital was estab lished in a tent in Guthrie, a town which began to peep out of the prai ries a few minutes earlier. On hun dreds of thousands of acres wheat be gan to be sown that afternoon. Scores of towns were staked out before sunset. Schools and churches began to make their appearance the next day. Just a month after the opening ay a convention met at Guthrie with the intention of forming a provisional government. Twelve months after the opening President Harrison put his signature to the bill creating the territory of Oklahoma. The territory which had 61.000 inhabitans in 1890 as 398.000 in 1900 or, rather, had that many on June 1 this year. The population has passed the 400.000 mark by this time. Nothing in Arabia's tales of enchantmens surpasses the peop ling of the prairies and forests of Ok lahoma. 

W0RKM6 FOR STATEHOOD The Governors Of New Mexico and Arizona In Wathlnaton. A conference fraught with much promise for the people of Arizona and New Mexico was held last night says Chicago dispatch. Governor N. O. Murphy of Arizona and Governor M. Otero of New Mexico were the two conferees, and immediately after the conference Governor Murphy left for Washington to inaugurate the cam paign which has for its object the ad mission of the two territories to state hood and the repeal or the clause ra the Shafroth irrigation bill that ex cludes the territories from participa tion in the proposed irrigation appro priation of $10,000,000. Both of the territories desire to take on the maturer honors of statehood and in both the people have empowered their governors to intercede with the authorities at Washington. Work for Statehood. Governor Otero, in discussing his mission and that of Governor Murphy to Washington, said: "We are numbers of the governor's committee that is to be present at the centennial exercises at the capital next Wednesday. We are going to Washing ton for other reasons, however, and we are in hopes that congress can be prevailed upon at be present session to pass bills admitting the two terri tories to statehood. "The people of both territories are very anxious for the honor, and they have often expressed their desire to have the matter brought before con gress. They waited upon me a short time ago, and, although I felt it would have been better to have the legisla ture take the first action, still they have been so clamorous for immediate action that we are to try to get a bill through at the present session. In the Irrigation Bill. "Another piece of legislation that we are to make every effort to effect is the naming of Ne wMexico and Arizona in the irrigation bill that Congressman Shafroth has introduced. For some un accountable reason the names of the two territories have been omitted in the measure, which calls for an appro priation of $10,000,000 for the purpose of constructing an irrigation system in several of the western states. Just why the names of New Mexico and Ari zona should be omitted we are at a loss to determine. The only reason that we can see for the omission is that we can see for the omission is that tha congressman from Colorado is mak ing an effort to aid our cause by ad vancing an argument why we should be admitted to the family of states. Why, we are wards of the govern ment, and as wards are entitled to even more consideration than are the states, and we trust that our plea for a share, and a good share, in the appropriation will not be set. aside." ' MRS. 

MARY ELLEN LEASE Never Did Think Much of Her Hus band, and Makes no Secret of It. She Began at the Washtub, Edu cated Herself, and Became the Head of the Family. Mary E. Lease, lawyer and political agitator, will this week fight for a di vorce from Charles Lease in the Sedg wick county district court. The pe tition will allege incompatibility, fail ure to provide, etc. For the past three yearsMr. and Mrs. Lease have not liv ed together. Mrs. Lease has lived in New York City, while her husband has conducted a drug store in Wichita. Mr. and Mrs. Lease were married at Osage Mission. Kan., in July. 1873. Thev hare four children, two sons and two daughters, all except one of whom ! are of age. The youngest son is with his mother in New York. The beginning of Mary Ellen Lease was at the washtub. There was no luck "in her marriage and she took in washing to keep the pot boiling. She already was the mother of two chil- dren. The groundwork of her little knowl- I edge was spelling and reading, but it wasenough for the ambitious washer- woman and she made good progress. First she studied at night after she had done her day's work and had put the children to bed. But this was too slow for her and to make time she nailed her lessons to the wall and studied them while she stood at the tub or over the ironing board. In course of time Mrs. Lease was capable of higher things than wash ing other women's clothes. She taught school and in other ways made her brain help to take care of her family, meanwhile two more children came to the household and yearly the load be came heavier. Her husband did his share but the two temperaments were incompatiabl and they pulled at cross purposes. He was a. piuuuer, cuuieuicu wun leiung tomorrow take care of itself. She liv ed in the future. She was ambitious to make a place for herself and her children. I It was in 1888, the year of the union . labor campaign. She was out in the rain, with some neighbors and they : took refuge in a hall where a union : labor meeting was in progress. The meeting was short of orators and somebody suggested Mrs. Lease. She never had addressed a public meeting, ! but among her neighbors and in clubs she had discussed economics .and after some hesitation she took the platform. Her remarks were a revelation to all. including herself. She never had sus pected her powers before. It was the opning she had sought, and from that hour she has been on the platform. She wen tinto the campaign at r-ce and again in 1S90. 1892 and 1894 ?he it was who set upon the trail c" .Tovi James Ingalls in 1890. and "v.e -"d more toward his undoing than snv public speaker.

She was on the same side in the recent campaign. She lives in. Ne"- York City with her four children, and in the city directory, after her name, is the word"lecturer." Her- son Charles, has a nosition in the revenue office. When Mrs. Lease was in the fullness of her reputation in Kansas there was great demand by the public for a glimps-" of her husband. Her own portrait was constatnly In the napers and the portraits of her son Charles and of her daughter Louise were also in public prints from time to time. Even the pictures of the boy. Ben Hur. and of the youngest child, its mother's namesake. Mary, were occasionally seen, but no sign of the face of Charles Henry Lease, the husband and father, appeared. He was vaguely described to be a little shriveling man. who was content to wield the pestle and mor tar in a drug store at Wichita, but what he looked like nobody knew. IWHBA .
