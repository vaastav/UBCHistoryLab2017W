(By Associated Press.) ' NEW YORK; Dec. 12. Indirect but pointed criticism of Roose velt's attitude toward the Judiciary was made by Chief Justice Mitchell of Pennsylvania tonight, in an address at a banquet of the Pennsylvania Society of New York. The' chief justice did not mention the executive1 by name but left no doubt through quotations and all uslons aS to the object of his criticism. "For the cure of evils 'temporarily prominent it Is impatiently advocated that the combined powers of. the government be centralized in the execu tive.' said Mitchell. "The only safety for all is obedience to the law as it is written, not to a strained and distorted construction to make it mean what it does not and never intends to mean. Only criticisms of judges and laws must come ;from & court which knows the law and has jurisdiction to declare it. Dissent from this view based upon individual opinion of what the law ought to be, whether it comes from an executive or p hoodlum, leads di rectly to anarchy and the assertion of individual will against set "tled law. The very phrases so prominently put forward of judges "who have lagged behind the times, betray not only Ignorance but deplorable incapacity to comprehend the fundamental principles of the American government."

As vice president, he had little to do with the ac tive management of the institution's affairs, his responsibility be-, coming potent only during the absence of the president. News of his Indictment came as a distinct shock to himself, and caused his hurried departure for Colorado several days ago, where he readily gave ample bonds.
