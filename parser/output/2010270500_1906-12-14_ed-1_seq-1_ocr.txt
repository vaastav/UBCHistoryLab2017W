O.VTIIOLICS OF FItANCK. ttrU4ial Quotes Violent Attacks Vpon kho Name of Jesus in Chamber of . .BcsHitJcs as Showing IiiHlnition ot lVcscut Crusade. "Ulhe American public Joes not un derstand the present crisis in France," nald Cardinal Gibbons when asked for hiii pinion on the French situation. He aoniinued: "I am Retting to be an old man now and I think 1 know my countrymen. They love fair play; they love liberty; their love to see human dealings ot man with man. And the late years have shown how cordially they hate Injustice, tyranny and inhumanity. And jrot France has treated her noblest citlaeus with Injustice and inhuman ity, and America, which has sympa thy for the oppressed of all nations, has raised no' protest nor uttered a word of sympathy. "U I believe that my countrymen would knowingly see a great organiza tion unjustly deprived of Its property, tens of thousands of honest men and noble women robbed of their just in come, hundreds of thousands of people brutally wounded In what they hold dearest and most sacred, a majority in tiie chambers disregard and tram ple apon the rights of the minority and the rights of millions of then countrymen In the name of liberty would knowingly see tens of thousands of prJesbj and nuns turned out of their homes for no crime but that of lovtn God I sny, if my countrymen can see and recognize all this Injustice and refuse genuine sympathy to those who suffer, then I will leave life without that faith In American love of justice, liberty and humanity. "But the American people have not had these things put fairly before them. Our own press has been to a considerable extent the reflex of the Parisian anU-olerical press. Most peo ple ever here have little conception of the French aiitl-clcrlcan). They look on the leaders of this party as en lightened statesmen seeking to pre serve tiie republic from an aggressive clever. "There have been honest and sin cere lovers of republican government ameng aiiri-cloricals, I admit, but the majority of them have far less love of the republio than they hav hatred of religion. "But in France the Jacobin ps rty In not dead. They, hate Ood, they hute Christ, they hate his religion as much as ever their fathers hated them. But their have learned a more prudent and measured method of attack. And yet the utterances of such men are receiv ed r.8 unsuspectingly by many Ameri cans as would be a discourse by Mr. Cleveland, or Mr. Roosevelt, or Mr. Taft."

Pope's Stand Foils to Arouse French Catholics. The clergy of Paris Issued special appeals Wednesday night to their par. ishloners to bo present at the churches Thursday at tho first mass celebrated outside the pale of the law. The gov- earnment, however, proposes to pro ceed gently. These services were not broken up, but policemen were in at tendance to note Infractions of the law and cite officiating priests or their assistants before the nearest Justice of the peace. The chief danger of dis orders in Paris Is believed to lie in the possible invasion of churches by row dies and free thinkers. Reserves of gendarme were stationed at various points throughout the city to guard against troubles of this sort. The efforts made by certain mem bers of the chamber of deputies and other disinterested persons to insure a continuation of churches in spite ot the papal veto, by inducing Catholic laymen in each parish to make the forbidden declaration, have not thus far met with much success. Up to a late hour Wednesday night the Church of St. John the Evangelist was the only church where such legal applica tion had been made. The indications are against anything which might be dignified by the namo of religious war, and the prompt ex pulsion from France of Mgr. Montag ninl, the secretary of the papal nun ciature here since the recall of tho nuncio, coupled with the threats to ex pel recalcitrant clergymen from France, haB had a sobering Influence. 

CHINESE FAMINE APPALLING. Situation In tho Orient Is Laid Before the State Department. It was semt-ofnclally stated Wed nesday that for the present at least no direct governmental appeal would be made to the United States for aid for famine sufferers In China. This de declslon was reached after the state depaitment had communicated with Louis Klopsch, of the Christian Her ald, which raised $200,000 for the Japanese sufferers, and who regaras the Russian famine as being infinitely worse, 80,000,000 people, or twice the number suffering in China, being af fected, Mr. Klopsch has Informed the de partment that he believes ' that if a Chinese appeal is now launched H would soon clash with the Russian appeal. Mr. Klopsch added, however, that if the state department concluded to aend out an appeal the Christian Herald would help in the undertak ing. He declares that Russia Is sore ly In need of help, but as yet no appeal has been sent out for that country. According to letters received by Mr. Klopsch 40,000 square miles In China supporting a population of 15,000,000, have been flooded, and so great Is the destitution that many parents are drowning their children rather than see theru starve, and themselves com mitting suicide.
