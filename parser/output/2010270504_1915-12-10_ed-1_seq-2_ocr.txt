America novor witnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed lt porslblo thnt con sworo Into Its own citlzcnshiti. men druwu out of great free stocks such ns sup tilled some of tho best nnd stroncost elements of that little, but how heroic. nation that In a high day of old staked Its very Hfo to frco Itself from ovorv entnncicmcnt thnt hnd dnrkenod Min fortunes of tho older nations and sot un a now standard here that men. of such origins nnd such free choices of allegiance would over turn In malign reaction against tho govern ment nnd nconlo who hnd welcomed and nurtured them and seek to mako this proud country onco moro n hot bed of Euronnan nnsslnn. A Httlo- whllo ago such a thing would havo seemed Incredible. Bocauso it was Incredlblo wo mado no nronaratlon for it. Wo would havo boon nlniost ashamed to prepare for it, as if wo- were suspicious of ourselves, our own comrades and nelchbors! nut tho ugly and Incredlblo thing hns actual ly como ubout and wo nro without ndequato federal laws to deal with lt. I urgo you to enact such laws at th- earliest possible moment nnd feel that in doing so I nm urelnc vnu to do. nothing less than snvo tho honor and self-respect of tho nation. Such creat turos of passion, disloyalty, nnd an- archy must bo crushed out. They aro not many, but thoy nro inilnltoly malignant, and tho hand of our power should closo over them nt once. Thhv havo formed plots to destroy property, thoy havo entered Into conspiracies against tho noutrallty of tho govern ment, thoy havo soucht tn nrv Inln ovory confidential transaction of tho government In order to Bervo Interests, alien to our own. It Is nosalblo to. deal with theso things very effectually. i neeii not sucgest the torma in which, they may bo dealt with. Are Disgrace to the Nation. I wiBh that it could ho snld tlmf only a fow men. misled bv mlRfnU-nn. sentiments of nlleglanco to tho govern- mentf; under which they woro born, hnd been guilty of disturbing tho solf possession and misrepresenting tho temper and principles of tho country during theso days of terrible war, when It would seem that every man who was truly an American wmilii Instinctively mako It hia duty and his. prldo to keep tho Bcales of ludcmonf even and prove himself a partisan ot no nation but his own. Out it cannot. Thoro aro some men among us, and many resident . abroad who, though, born nnd bred in tho United Stntea and calling themselves Amnrlrana havo so forgotton themselves and their honor ns citizens ns to nut Mmir passionate sympathy with ono or tho other side in tho great Euronean eon. llict above their regard for tho peaco and dignity ot tho United States. Thoy also preach and nractlco dlslovaltv. No Inws, I suppose, can reach cor ruptions of tho mind and heart; but I should not apeak of others without also speaking of theso and expressing- tno oven uoeper humiliation and scorn which every self-possessed nnd. thoughtfully patriotic American must feel when he thinks of them nnd of tho discredit thoy uro dally bringing: upon us. While wo speak of tho nrenarntlnn of tho nation to mako sure of her security and her effectivo nownr w must not fnll into tho patent error of supposing that hor real strencth comes from armaments and mere safe guards of written law. What is moro important Is. thnt Mm Industries and resources of tho coun try should be available and rnnilv fnr mobilization. Tho transportation nroblom Is nn exceedingly serious and prcssinE ono ln this country. There has from timo to time of late been renson to fear that our railroads would not much longer bo nblo to copo with it successfully, as at present equipped and co-ordained. I suggest that 11 would bo wlso to provide for a com mission ot Innuirv to ascertnln hv thorough canvass ot tho wholo ques tion Whether our lawn nn fit nrnennl framed and administered are as serv iceable as they might bo in tho solu. tion ot tho problem. It is obviouslv a problem that lies at tho very founda. tion of our efficiency as a people. Such an inquiry ought to draw out ovory clrcumstanco nnd opinion worth con' sidoring and wo need to know all sides of tho matter If wo mean to do any thing in the field of federal legislation. Regulation of Railroads. No ono. I nm sure, would wtnh tn tako any backward ston. Tho rnmiin. tion of tho railways of tho country by rcueral commission has had admirable results and hns fully Justified Mm. hopes and expectations of thoBO by whom tho policy of regulation wai originally proposed. Tho question Is not what should wo undo? It is, whether thoro Is anything else wo can do that would supply us with effective means, in tho very nrocess nf mini.. tion, for bettering tho conditions urn dor which tho railroads aro operated and for making thorn moro useful anw. anta of tho country ns a wholo. If seems to mo that it might bo tho part of wisdom, therefore, before furthor legislation In this field Is nttompted, to look at tho whole problem of co-ordlna. tion and ofllcloncy in tho full light of a fresh assessment of clrcuniHtnnon nmi opinion, ns a guldo to dealing with the soverni parts or it. For what wo aro sceklnc now. tvim ln my mind Is tho slnglo thought of tins messago, is national efficiency and security. Wo servo n creat nni Wo should servo It in tho spirit of Its' peculiar genius.
