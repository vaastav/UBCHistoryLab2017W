OLD-TIME LAS VEGAN f DIES AT CIMARRON 1 Washington, Dec. 7- The first an nual message of President Taft waa read to both houses of the Sixty-first congress today. The reading waa fol lowed with great interest by repub licans and democrats alike. It was favorably commented upon generally. When, the reading of the message was concluded both the senate and house djourned until Friday. In the mess age the tariff, the Nicaraguan ques-1 tion, BUgar frauds, traffic in white slavery and statehood for New Mex ico and Arizona, are among the most important questions discussed. "Perhaps the most important ques tion presented to this administration is that ot economy in expenditure and sufficiency ot revenue," says the presi dent, who discusses the methods tak en to meet the deficit. The president declares It unwise to attempt further revision ot the tariff until the facts are at hand upon which such revision can properly be undertaken. Speak' ing generally he says the country is In a high state of prosperity. He notes the increase in the cost of living but says the tariff is not the cause. In these products of the factory, and farm there has been no increase in the tariff and In. many instances a very considerable reduction, the pres ident declares. In beginning, the president says: "The relations of the United States with all foreign governments have .' continued the normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory." "At the date when this message is printed' this government has term inated diplomatic - relations with the Zelaya government for reasons made public in a communication to the for mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires end is intending to take such future steps as may "be found most consistent with its dignity. Its duty to American In terests and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may be necessary for ma to bring this subject to the attention of con gress in a special message." Concerning the Far East, the presi dent says this government preserves unchanged its policy ' of supporting the "open door" and adds: "Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial as usual. The arrangement ot 1908 for a cooperative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily." Reorganization of the department of state upon modern lines in further ance of our foreign trades of Ameri can interests abroad Is recommend ed. Economy Urged. "Perhaps," continues the message, "the most important question present ed to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and suffic iency of revenue. "The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the receipts by $34,070,620. If to this deficit is added the sum to be disbursed for-the Pan ama canal amounting to $38,000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public News reached the city this moriing that Marcial Trujillo an old-time tesl dent of Las Vegas, died yesterday at Cimarron, Colfax county.

SHELDON CRITICAL- LY ILL WITH AFFECTION OF THE HEART New York, Dec. 7. The criminal Investigation and prosecution of mat ters of the Phoenix Insurance com pany 0f Brooklyn, the surplus of which, according to a statement is sued by State Superintendent of In surance Hotchkiss, has been Impair ed a million dollars, will now be abandoned because of the possible fatal illness of George P. Sheldon, the deposed president of that company. Mr. Sheldon was removed yesterday at the instigation of the state insur ance department. His case has been placed in the handh of the district attorney.' The insurance department believes the company's risks to the public will not be involved and that the entire loss through loans negoti ated by Sheldon can be balanced, by crosping oft a million of the ' com pany's three million dollar surplus." ' Although " the investigation shows that Sheldon managed the company's affairs without consulting the board of directors, Superintendent Hotch kiss declares each of the directors Is responsible under ' the law. The charges which led to Sheldon's remov al were iiiat he had overdrawn his salary, unloaded doubtful securities on the company and used the com pany's assets as collateral to secure his own private speculative accounts. In a formal statement Issued today, Superintendent Hotchkiss does not believe the capital of the company is impaired and thus far there is no L . ministration, annual reports of the company made' to he insurance de partment In ten years and probably longer are false in more than one par ticular. ' g-' - Under the law the insurance de partment is required to examine all life insurance companies at least once in thee years. Mr. Hotchkiss advocates an increase In the exam ining force that Insurance companies other than life companies may be ex amined at least once . every' five years.' Mr. (Hotchkiss says the Phoe nix company, which is a fire concern, has not been examined for nearly twenty-two years. :. The, 'insurance department alleges that It finds tbe questionable securi ties originally sold to the company by Mr. Sheldon, have, year after year, passed through wash sales and by thfs method, been concealed-in the annual report. ' Speculative accounts have been maintained by President Sheldon, according to Mr, Hotchkiss, at least one brokerage ''nouse and "the assets of thePioenix have been up as collateral to foer his operations) It Is charged also , that for several years the president's'' salary arcount has been overdrawn ana now :s PjiiUJ .
