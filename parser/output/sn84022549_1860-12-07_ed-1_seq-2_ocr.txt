But he finds nowhere any power in the general government to coerce a state into remaining jn the confederacy; nor can he think it would be wise to -undertake it, even were the power granted or inferable. So long, in other words, as a state docs not attempt to seize upon the federal revenues, or interfere with their collection, and re pecis the property of the United States within her limit, o long does Hhe seem at liberty, by the constitution and laws, to in dule in the luxury of seceding. The oth- tT subjects discussed are comparatively of Jittle interest, and a the message would fill mne entire paper, it is not probable that we shall publish it entire to the exclusion of matter which we aie sure nincty-nins of every one hundred of our readers would prefer. ....... The Treasury Defalcation. ' The committee of Ways and Means, in their Report to the Legislature, say that the Treasurer had kept the accounts so loosely for a long time, that they are now generally a mass of unintelligibly confusion. The committe have however, come to the following conclusion : Amount due sundry Banks, which is re ported as paid by II. M. liatei. as Ireas- - urer, $18,091 16 .Amount due to Banks $22, 762 32. Amount received , of sundry Banks $4,0.71 16.) ."Amount loaned to the State by sundry individuals not before reported as due, . 27,097 D2 Amount collected on taxes and . not credited, the snme having been reported as due, in ' eluding errors in tax accounts and claims of sundry indi- iduals not yet adjusted, . S3,70j 39 , Amount, S 18,891 47 . "Several sums of money have been re coived from sundry Batiks, w hich were re .ported as paid. , The said amounts were ffarwarded In consequence of a circular sent to them asking information. Tbesame remarks apply to tax on "For eign Bank Stocks." Of the amounts he ;jaid no credit list has yet been made. So many variations and errors are found In nearly every department, the books are .fnaccurate, so many vouchers are miss ing, (which must be replaced,) that it is impossible at this time to give a correct statement of the affairs of the late Treas- lurer. , Absilt sbitv towns arc yet to be heard from in regard to taxes. Errors, $30G C5 Claims,S2,237 80. No accurate memo trnnda are as yet found showing to whom 4'lhe Slate Loan of 1857" was awarded or the premiums thereon. ,, The Committe reported that when Mr. JVates moved to Korthficld, six or seven years since, he was supposed to be the ewner of not more 2000 or 83000 more than he was indebted; but that now he has assigned to Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Bel .knap, two of- his bondsmen. property valued by him at 33,000 or more, and estimated by the assignees to be woi th at h ast $30, '000. What this property cost does not rtpet.T. It appears, further, that said Treasurer's habits of living have been somewhat expensive, and he has been en 4jagd in many speculations, some of which Wve been unfortunate aud disastrous. In : one Of.theselaiing to patent, it appears no invested $3000, and some proof tended ,to show nearly 20,000. The assignment named above is to iden tify the assignees from linbililv m bonds men, and if there is surplus over tlulr lia bility, the balance is for the benefit of the .other bondsmen. " , The democratic press of the State have raised a cry against the republican party of " Vermont in connection with this difalca fion, and charge the KepirWican press with 'being si'ent. The truth is that while the democratic papers have been engaged in idiytiayiii;; biige typo, ihe republican paper have published !nd exposed the defalcation and in no instance have they defend .d the ' perpetrator of the fiaud.

We had supposed that l 'e t in New England, the right of free pevch was to thorougly established, that no such disgrace ful scene in i lint enacted in Do-ton the oili er day, would ever have o curre I. But old hui.keii. in tliiS hard, and i: is the same in Boston. O" Monday la-t, the Alailitionisls of Boston and vicinity, undertook to hold n meeting in Treinual Teinph;, it beiir llu anniversary of the execution of John Brow n, and ulso to discn-s the subject of slavery, whereupon tho occasion was seized by the self-styled "conservatives," w ho went to thi meeting and formed themselves into a "respectable mob," mid broke it up. Several free lights occurred, the police were calltd in, and the abolitonists mid con servatives each chose a chairman, amid the stamping, cheers and groans of the crowd. The "conservaiives" were ihe most nu merous, and of course made the most noise, and certainly behaved the most indecent. During the performance, Uev. D. C. Kddy, formerly speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, tried to prevail on the 'eminent respectability" to allow fees speech, hut all in vain, and it is now hoped that South Carolina will remain in the union another fortnight. The effect of this exhibition of Boston ftuukcyiftn will be the reverse from what was intended, or precisely as when they nt tacked Uev. Mr. Alger's Fourth of July Oration, a ftw years since. Had they per mitted the meeting to have been held, it would have passed off quietly, and compar atively but few would ever known that such a meeting had been held. Now it will be heralded all over the union, and the abolitionists may well chuckle in their sleeves ubotitf it. We do not believe in the acts of John Brown, but we do believe in the freedom of speech, and it is a shame and disgrace to Boston, or any other place, if they can not maintain it. Wo close by an extract from the Springfield (Mass.) Republican. That paper says : "This singular demonstration in Boston is of littlo significance in itself. It only shows that there are several varieties of the genus fool still extant, and there are certainly none more stupid than those who suppose they are contributing to the salva tion of the Union by attempting to suppress th ) freedom of speech on any subject. They ought to know, too, by this time, that there is nothing ultraism thrives so fust up on as persecution, and nothing such men as Kedpnlh and his associates court more than the'n.itriety given them by a row. They are a thousand times better satisfied tlian if they had been allowed to utter their harm less eulogies on John Brown without op position. Congress. Congrws met last Monday, and proceed ed to business as usual, but both houses adjourned afler a very brief session. On Tuesday the President's message was re ceived and read, and the usual number or dered to be printed. Pending the motion to print, Mr. Clingman of North Carolina whose re-election at home is now hanging by the gills, made a seccession speed The whole thing was evidently intended for home consumption, and Senator Crittenden of Kentucky, made n brief hut pointed re ply, and told tho North Carolina gentleman that Senators holding such sentiments as he had advanced had better not come there nt all. The Republicans very properly kept quiet. ' s In the House a committee of one from each State has been raised on the stato of the Union. This committee it is expected will save the Union. The yeas and nays were called onc3 on Tuesday, and some half dozen fire-eaters refused to votp, as (luir Slatts were about to secede. One member from South Carolina refused to vote, and said his State was out of the Union already, except by mnre form of declaration, and that the delegation from that Slate look no interest in the question pending, (it being the committee of one from each State.) These statements of the fire-eaters were received with laughter by the House, and must have been anything but agreea'de to the d ploniatists, (.-ball we call them ?) from the southern republic. -Wonder : if the lninisters from France or England would not take seats in congress, and take their sa'aries. y The Lamoille Ji'cirstlealer, is the name of a very neatly prin'ed sheet just issued nt Hyde Park. It has the nppear nnce of a right smart newspaper, and w-i wish it much succes. We see by looking over its columns that it seems lo be in a 1 little extra haste to wipe out our personal liberty laws. We trust our friends will not be ii a hurry abrit it. Perhaps we ! tin not need such laws here in Vermont.but j it is not best to be bullied into this business j and much leis to play flunkey. We don't i believe the people of Lamoille Cotintv de- mand any such thing, certainly not unless they are different frcm what thev used to 0;be.

'I lie Legislature. The legislature adjourned on Tuesday morning of last week, as before announced. The bill paying Thomas E. Powers &7,000 for sei vices as superintendent in building the State House, was amended so as to read $.),400 and passed. A largo number of bills were dismissed. The bill abolishing all the personal liberty laws was dismissed 123 to 58. This bill was brought forward by Mr. Thomas, democrat, of West Fair lee. Afterwards, both Houses unanimously authorized the committee on revision of laws, to inquire if there are any laws on our statutes conflicting w ith the laws of the United Slates, and report to the next legis lature. In tho Senate, Mr. W'oodbridge made the following remarks : Mr. President If there be any statutes on our statute books which conflict with the Constitution of the United States, or with the laws of Congress it is time the people of Vermont knew it. A resolution was introduced into this House, but a few days ago, requesting the judiciary committee to examine the question, but want of lime compelled that committee to leave undone that duty. It is undoubtedly true. Sir, that there is no State in the Union which is more conservative in regard to the Consti tution and the union of these states than Vermont. It is true, Sir, that Ihe people of Vermont,- the legislature of Vermont, the judiciary of Vermont, do not wish and will not tolerate, upon ourslatutebooks any law tluit conflicts with the Constitution and the laws of our general government. No State is more sound on the vexed questions of the day than Vermont no State, siv, so ready and willing toeuirautee and protect to every Slate in the Union the rights which ore guaranteed and protected there by the constitution and laws of the United Stales. No State in the Union is more determined to go for freedom and for free men, or more determined to have that territory, which is equal to all, trod only by the loot ot freemen, than V ermont is. A .l t.. IP .r-n tmna one tour ...liirtl, tc in '. . ' .,, ' ,., ,, ',, conflict with the constitution and laws oi l the United States, let us strike it at once from our statute books. The circus bill was passed in the House, giving the right to any company to perform in the State, by paying a license of $2,000 into the State treasury. We believe this bill lodged in the Senate, and therefore does not become a law. Ko further proceedings were had in re lation to State House matters. We shall prol ably receive the laws for publication rest week, and then our readers will get a definite idea of what has been done. On th? w hoi , the l.itu legislature is en titled lo much credit for the manner it has dischi'.rcd its duiies. The number of de baters was not large, but was amply made up by few the who were generously willing to speak on any subject which came up. Tlie Atlantic Monthly for December closes the Clh Volume.

Strictly practical as my fiieml was, it was char he had only the theory of the thing in his mind. According to the , . , consiitution, the South must bear w ith a 1 ' 0 man, for the next four years, just as the North, with nearly double the population, "lias acknowledged a southerner in that voflice for forty-eight year.i out cf the seventy-two years of our government. For two thirds of the remaining years the office has been held by 'northern men with southern principles the mere organs of the slave power. What more faithful servant has the South ever had than Millard Fillmore? What more supple tool than Franklin Pierce or James Buchanan ? But now that there is chosen a northern man with some northern principles, the South scorns submission. The leading Republican pa pers are easer in their assurances of " no harm " done or meant. They point to Lincoln's record in congress, lo his answer to Douglaa'. catechism on the stump, to prove him a true friend of the slave-holder no advocate of the blacks. But the South discerns a little leaven working in this northern mass, and she vows she will turn the whole thing over. She will be free ; free to buy her negroes where she pleases, take tliem whither she pleases, and hold them as long as she pleases, and we hear of little from the South but of seces sion, and of meetings wild for it, of Palmet to flags, blue cockades and lone stars, ad libtiunu That there are earnest disunionists nt the South, in South Carolina and the gulf States, there can be no doubt. There is another class there now less prominent, who dread disunion, yet join in the present cry hoping to alarm the sensitive commer cial spirit of the North, and get some val uable concession in return for allowing Mr. Lincoln to take his seat at Washington in accordance with the constitution and the laws. They too declare their terms, and unless these are granted they will join the disunionists. The New York Times, a most able paper, which a year or more ago called itself of a party, though now pro fessing republicanism, after printing with commendation, a speech from Mr. Stevens of Georgia, delivered in the hall of Representatives there, Nov. 14, advising delay and further efforts for redress of griev ances before coming to secession ; and in another number a most insultin" speech 1 from a Mr. Hill, made at the same place on the next day, also advising delay, is obliged to confess " that this is not tho high est type of Unionism. " Yet, pretty plain ly, the Ar. Y. Times thinks it the best we can get, and ihat we had better take it and come to terms. Now what are the terms ? First, AN 

EFFICIENT FUGITIVE SLAVE law. That which Daniel Webster advo cated, and Millard Fillmore signed, is not strong enough. Though "the effort lo swallow that " is said " to hate killed the Whig party, " the Republican party is ex pected to swallow a tougher one, or at least make fewer grimaces. And the A'ctc lork Times nnd the Albany Evening Journal, and even the Springfield Republi can, recommend trying. All these personal liberty bills so offensive lo our southern slave-holders, must be repealed. They must have free hunting ground. Mr. Hill of Georgia, says : (see X. Y. Times, Nov. 27) "Now let the South compel a northern President to execute the laws (the fugitive slave law) against a northern people ; yea, the very rebels that elected him. " Here a voice called out to Mr. Hill : " Do you believe Lincoln would issue his proclamation ? " Mr. Ilill-r" We could make him do it. ft f3 hhy ryntir.

And is the latter to accept them ? And will her orators call tl.is " forbearance " " magnanimity ? " Has tho North indeed been so long ued to 1 1 ... . i i :.. the domineering of (he South', that when she has the power in her hands, ho dare not use it, without first saying to the slave owners, By your leave, Oood Masters?" We trust not, but in conclusion let us ven ture to remind the Republican managers that the Whig party once had a triumph. It was fatal to it. The name of Whig has lost its savor, though Mr. Lincoln has been called one. The Whig party is dead. The same will be true, ere another decade shall come round, of the Republican party, if it make tiny further compromise upon this mighty question. Onk who A'otkd for Lincoln. 

BATES NEWS. Lates news from Washington says there in no counternunce given there in Repub lican circles to the new Congressional coin promise suggested in the New-York and Albany papers. The Republican Senators especially are a unit in opposition, including Mr. Seward, whoso position has been sup posed to be compromised by hi intimate relations with some of the journalists in question. A well defined division is already show ing itself among Southern men in regard to the position the South should assume in the present crisis, If the South is let alone, its own disagreement will soon block the operations of the fire eaters. TBe policy of the Republicans is a mas terly inactivity. In the Georgia House of Representatives a bill Jo directly secede from the Union was voted down last Saturday by ayes 3G nays 89.
