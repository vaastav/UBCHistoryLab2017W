FOUR HUNDRED SICK ,FOR ONE BED. , Startling Revelation of the Lack Accommodations for consump tives. of Fifteen thousand beds and 600,000 patients, or 400 consumptives for every bed, is a statement made today by the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis in its Investigation as to the need of beds for destitute consumptives in the United States. Gathering statistics from every State in the country and from every hospital in which any provision what ever is made for tuberculosis patients, it has been found that the total num ber of beds provided, both by public and private resources, Is less than 15,000. Over against these figures, the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis has; placed the fact that there are, ac cording to the estimate of the United States Bureau of the Census, at least 600,000 living cases of tuberculosis in this country and that at least 200, tiOO persons die from this disease every year. When. analyzed as to their geog raphical distribution, New York State leads the list with 3,556 beds, while Pennsylvania comes next with over 1,500. Colorado and Massachusetts each have over L250, while New Mex ico, the next in order, has 915 beds for consumptives. Several states pro vide less than 20 beds, among these being," Delaware, Kansas and South Carolina, while some of the States, such as Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada, make no 'provision whatever for tuberculosis patients, either, in private or .public hospitals. The Adirondack region in New York State; Colorado, and particularly the regions about Denver and Colorado Springs; New Mexico, Arizona, and the Southwest; and North Carolina, are the principal Tesorts for consump-1 tives. The recent demonstrations of experts, however, that tuberculosis can be cured In any climate, has led to a considerable distribution of the bed -capacity and has called into ex istence a large number of small sana toria, hospitals, and day camps, some of them with a capacity of "only six beds. This Is shown by the fact that, while the number of sanatoria during the last four years has more than doubled, the increase in the numberl of beds, has been -only about 50 per cent. The most striking fact emphasized by the investigation is that, while the lack of beds for all classes of con sumptives .is so manifest throughout I the country, the number of beds need ed for advanced cases is far greater than the number needed for all the other stages put together. Of the 15, 000 beds at present available for all classes of consumptives, less than' 5,- . 90 Are for advanced cases. Comput ing that there are at least 200,000 liv ing cases in the advanced stages of tabercjBlosk-in the United States at the present time, the need far a large surafeesbf additional beds for this iHCHfE deserving class is evident Dr. John. S. BflllngB, of the Health De partment of New York City, estimates that about 18 to 70 per cent of the ad vanced cases are unable to provide for their proper care at home. This 'jaeaas that over 12,000 beds in hospi tals for advanced -cases should be pro vided. The seed i or accoBamodaUon for advanced cases is farther empha sised by the fact that every expert and specialist has agreed, oa this, ooscla sfea, that ooBSSBpttea wifl sever Se eradicated lata the advanced cases of the disease are isolated, either In their homos or in IwtJtatiaas. Dc says, Tm ease ef tafeercalo- sfco-ria he Jaeiated as- lafeg s fc 1 are there. Dr. Arthur Mm holme, one of the best English spe cialists on tuberculosis, says that the only tray In which, the death, rate from consumption can be reduced is by segregating nil advanced cases, be cause these are the centers of lnfec tlon from which the disease spreads. . It is not difficult, the National Asso ciation affirms, to cure consumption, in Its oarly stages, but it Is impossible to effect a. cure in 'the latter stages of the disease, and, consequently, these cases should be removed or Isolated in. their homes in order to prevent the infection of persons, liv ing with them. But they cannot be removed or isolated unless hospitals are provided for that 'purpose; and with this end In view, .a campaign to secure more accommodations for ad vanced cases of tuberculosis Is being carried on all over the country. When enough beds are provided. It Is esti mated that the death rate from con sumption will be cut in half and there will be an annual saving to the coun try of 100,000 lives.

CONTRACT. Black Diamond Development Company Places a Contract for Ten More Gas Wells on Their Property. Information has just been received from Kansas that the contract for ten more Gas wells on the Black Diamond properties has been signed and that the driling rig had been moved to B. D. D. Co. No. 11, and that as fast as the contractor can finish one well he will start another and so on until No. 20 has been brought in and finished. This will be good ews for those who are stockholders in this company as this contract means as much more work will be done on their property during the next six months as has been done during the past three years, and no one was asked to buy a -dollars worth' of stock in order to get this development done. The Board of. Directors have been quietly at work for several weeks on the deal and put it through and had it closed before any one was made aware of the fact that any such gigan tic deal was on foot, and they cer tainly ueserve great credit for the hard work that they have done for this company. At the Stockholders' meeting in Oc tober AH of the former Board was re-elected, and also the. officers for another -year, and tho -closing of this deal shows the wisdom of such action, for the deal has been "on the fire" for sometime. The members of the Board of Direc tors are wearing a broad smile these days and can well afford to do so. CHATEAU RINK NOTES.

WHIG " Concluded from Page 1. ' The President's special message sub mitted to Congress yesterday is an extraordinary climax of an extraor- dinarj- course of unwarranted accusa- tionh and of disregard of justice and the rules of evidence. It adds no evi dence against the discharged soldiers. Its savor of manufactured evidence" discredits the case of tho administra tion. The public, little concerned in the cause of justice for the Negro troops in the first place, and Influ enced by prejudice which has been incited against the senatorial cham pion of these soldiers, may not be in clined to consider the case on Its merits. But If prejudice Is laid aside, and it justice Is recognized, the PresI dent's latest witness, Conyers and Lawson the detective, are likely to be effective witnesses for the defence."
