PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Lynching Discussed at Length as a Na~ tional Evil. NOT A RACE QUESTION Control of Combinations of Capi tal a Paramount Issne. AN INCOME TAX DEMANDED Mr. Roosevelt Advocates Free Trade For Philippines, Federal Marriage and Divorce Law and Mainte nance of Strong Navy. fTo the Senate and House of Represent atives: As a nation we still continue to en joy a Iiterailj unprecedented pros perity, and it is probable that only reckless speculation and disregard of legitimate business methods on the part of the business world can ma terially mar this prosperity. No congiess in our time has done more good work of importance than the present congress. There were sev eral matters left unfinished at your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete be fore your -uljournment. Corporation Campaign Contributions. I again recommend a law prohibit ing all corpoiations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party Such a bill has already passed one house of congress. Let individuals con tribute as they desire, but let us pro hibit in effective fashion all corpora tions from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indi rectly. Government's Right of Appeal In Criminal Crses. Another bill which lias just passed one house of the congress and which it is urgently necessary should be en acted into lav, is that conferring upon the government the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states. It exists in the District of Columbia by -act of the congress. It is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently in one district where the government had indicted cer tain persons for conspiracy in connec tion with rebates the court sustained the defendant's demurrer, while in an other jurisdiction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions ob tained under it and two defendants sentenced to imprisonment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfor tunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At present there is no way by which the government can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court, and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. I cannot too strongly urge the passage of the bill in question. A failure to pass it will result in seri ously hampering the government in its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy individuals or corpo rations that do wrong, and may also prevent the government from obtain ing justice for wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to con test a case where the judgment of an inferior court has been against them. I have specifically in view a recent de -cision by a district judge leaving rail way employees without remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurdity to per mit a single district judge, against what may be the judgment of the im mense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional" and then to deny to the government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion. It is well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law often depends not lupon the passage of acts as to which there is great public excitement, but upon the passage of acts of this na ture as to which there is not much public excitement, because there is lit tle public understanding of their im portance, while the interested parties are keenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The importance of enacting into law the particular bill in question is further increased by the fact that the government has now defi nitely begun a policy of resorting to (the criminal law In those trust and in terstate commerce cases where such a course offers a reasonable chance of {success. At first, as was proper, every {effort was made to enforce these laws (by civil proceedings, but it hag be icome increasingly evident that the ac ftlon of the government in finally decid ing In certain cases to undertake crim inal proceedings was justifiable, and, though there may have been some con spicuous failures in these cases, we have had many successes, which have undoubtedly had a deterrent effect up on evildoers, whether the penalty in flicted was In the shape of fine or iui prlsonment. A ml penalties of* both kinds have already been inflicted bj the courts Of course where the judge can see his way to inflict the penalty of imprisonment the deterrent effect the punishment on other offenders is Increased, but sufficiently heavy flues accomplish much. Judge Holt of the New York district court in a recent ilecision admirably stated the need for treating with just severity offenders of this kind. His opinion runs in part ps follows: Judge Holt Quoted. "The government's evidence to es tablish the defendant's guilt was clear, conclusive and undisputed. The case was a flagrant one. The transactions which took place under this Illegal contract were very large, the amounts of rebates returned were considerable, and the amount of the rebate Itself was large, amounting to more than one-fifth of the entire tariff charge for the transportation of merchandise from this city to Detroit. It is not too much to say. in my opinion, that if this busi ness was carried on for a considerable time on that basisthat is, if this dis crimination in favor of this particular shipper was made with an eighteen instead of a twenty-three cent rate and the tariff rate was maintain ed as against their competitorsthe result might be, and not improba bly would be, that their competi tors would be driven out of business. This crime is one which in its nature is deliberate and premeditated. I think over a fortnight elapsed between the date of Palmer's letter requesting the reduced rate and the answer of the railroad company deciding to grant it, and then for months afterward this business was carried on and these claims for rebates submitted month after month and checks in payment of them drawn mouth after month. Such a vi ilation of the law. in my opinion, in its essential nature is a very much more heinous act than the ordinary common, vulgar crimes which come be fore criminal courts constantly for pun ishment and which arise from sudden passion or temptation. This crime in this case was committed by men of education smcl of larere business experi ence, Mhose standing in the community was such th.it they might have been expected to set an example of obedi ence to law, upon the maintenance of which alone in this country the securi ty of their property depends. It was committed on behalf of a great ra road corporation, which, like other rail road corporations, has received gratu itously from the state large and valu able privileges for the public's con venience and its own, which performs quasi public functions and which is charged A A ith the highest obligation in the transaction of its bvsmess to treat the citizens of this country alike and not to carry on its business with unjust discriminations between different citi zens or different classes of citizens. This crime in its nature is one usually done with secrecy and proof of which it is very difficult to obtain. "The Interstate commerce act was passed in 18S7, nearly twenty years ago. Ever since that time complaints of the granting of rebates by railroads have been common, urgent and insist ent, and, although the congress has re peatedly passed legislation endeavor ing to put a stop to this evil, the diffi culty of obtaining proof upon which to bring prosecution in these cases is so great that this is the first case that has ever been brought in this court, and, as I am informed, this case and one recently brought in Philadelphia are the only cases that have ever been brought in the eastern part of this country. In fact, but few cases of this kind have ever been brought in this country, east or west. Now, under these circumstances I am forced to the conclusion In a case In which the proof is so clear and the facts are so flagrant it is the duty of the court to fix a penalty which shall in some de gree be commensurate with the gravity of the offense. As between the two de fendants, in my opinion, the principal penalty should be imposed on the cor poration. The traffic manager in this case presumably acted without any ad vantage to himself and without any in terest in the transaction either by the direct authority or in accordance with what he understood to be the policy or the wishes of his employer. "The sentence of this court in thid case is that the defendant Pomeroy for each of the six offenses upon which he has been couicted be fined the sum of $1,000, making six fines, amounting in all to the sum of $6,000, and the de fendant, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad company, for tach of the six crimes of which it has been convicted be fined the sum of $18,000, making six fines, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $108,000. imd judgment to that effect will be Entered in this case." Getting Aside of Judgments and Grant ing of New Trials. In connection with this matter I would like to call attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our criminal law, resulting in large part from the habit of setting aside the judgments of Inferior courts on technicalities abso lutely unconnected with the merits of the case and where there is no attempt to show that there has been any failure of substantial justice. It would be well to enact a law providing some thing to the effect that i No judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civil or criminal, on the ground of misdi section of the jury or the improper ad mission or rejection of evidence or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure unless, In the opinion of th* court to which the application la made, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
