(X W a8hiwo*o5, December 3, 1870. SENATE. The Senate was called to order at noon by the Vice President, in the presence of a very large audience. Nearly all the 8enator* were in their seats. The usual committee was appointed to act with a committee from the House, and inform the President of the readiness of the Senate to transact busi ness. After prayer by the Chaplain, Mr. William Windom, of Minnesota, was qualified and took his seat for the un expired term of Senator Norton, of that State, deceased. Several resolutions were introduced find temporarily laid on the table, 1 among which were the following: By Mr. Edmunds, joint resolution of the Vermont Legislature, urging the payment of the balance of the war claims due that State from the general government. By Mr. Kellogg, for the removal of political disabilities. By Messrs. Cole and Casserly, for the immediate repeal of all laws for the collection of income or any tnx of that nature after the 1st of January next. By Mr. Sumner, a bill to terminate the fabrication of United States notes and fractional currency, strengthen the reserves of national banks, and pro mote the return of specie payment Mr. Cole offered a joint resolution relating to gold notes and United States notes. The latter provides that after June 30, 1871, such notes shall be re ceivable at their face value for duties on imports. Resolutions were introduced and temporarily laid aside, as follows : By Mr. Fenton, requesting the Presi dent to communicate all correspondence between the United States Minister at Paris and the Secretary ef State since the breaking out of the war between France and Prussia, so far as the same relates to political subjects and matters connected with said war, as well as to the protection of subjects of the North German confederation, with which the United States legation at Paris has been charged. A resolution offered by Mr. Trumbull was adopted, directing the Secretary of the Treasury to furni6h the Senate with a copy of the forms of entries, oaths, bonds, rules and regulations prescribed by him under the act of July 14, 1870, providing for the immediate transporta tion of merchandise from ports of entry to ports of delivery. Mr. Sherman made an ineffectual ef fort to get up the bill ceding certain ju risdiction of the State of Ohio referring to the reception of votes of inmates of the Soldiers' Asylum. At 1:30 the President's message was received, and the next hour was occu pied in its reading by the Secretary It was then ordered punted. At 2 35 the Senate adjonrned novae. The opening of the third session of the Forty-first Congress was attended with the usual pleasant greetings be tween members. The residents and visitors to Washington turned out in great numbers to witness the opening of i he session. The galleries and corri dors of the House were crowded with ppectatore. The House wns called to order at noon by Speaker Blaine. The proceedings were opened with praver by the Chaplain, Rev D. J O. Butler. The roll of members was then called, and 173 members answered to their names. On motion of Mr. Schenck, a com mittee was appointed to join a like com mittee of the Senate, wait on the Presi dent of the United States, and inform him that Congress was in session and j readv to receive any communication he , might think proper to make. Messrs. Schenck, Allison and Potter were appointed such committee on the part of the House. Sir. Sypher was sworn in as member from the First district of Louisiana, and Mr. Dixon from the Second district of North Carolina. ] Mr. Duke, after an unsuccessful at tempt on the part of Messrs. Schenck and Pratt to have his credentials refer- 1 red to the committee on Elections, was ' called upon to take the oath as a mem- j ber from the Fifth district of Virginia, | but was not present. The House at one o'clock took a re cess till 1:45, awaiting the reception of the President's message. The recess having expired, Mr. Duke, member elect from Virginia, presented himself and took the oath of office. | The President's message was then do- j livered, and McPherson, Clerk of the House, proceeded to read it. The conclusion of the message was received with applause on the floor and galleries. The message was ordered to be printed. The Treasury report was presented and referred to the committee on Ways and Means. A bill to supply the omission in the last Indian appropriation bill was re ported by Mr. Dawes and passed. The Home at thfee o'clock adjourn ed. _ Washington, December 6. 

SENATE. Several bills were introduced, when the Senate adjourned to complete the informal revision of the standing com mittees. Bills were introduced as follows : By Mr. Harlan, to authorize the elec tion of a delegate to Congress from the Indian territory. By Mr. Scott, to repeal so much of the act of July 14, 1870, which con tinues the incomc tax after December 31, 1869. By Mr. Fenton, authorizing the Poet master General to continue to use in the Postal Service patented devioe, post marking and more effectual cancellation postal 6tampe. A resolution offered by Mr. Sherman was adopted, calling upon the Secretary of the Treasury for copies of the regu lationa prescribed by him for the trans portation of goods in bond from foreign i countries through the United States to Canada. I? arrivr M ??icpVeve iatohBaliy the wtMon of the standing committee^lhe! jtanate, ?t 14:90, adjourned. ip?(js? Messrs. FVank and Morris, of Lou* ! isiana, Cbarlee H. Holmes, of New Yort aiid Win. F. Wolf, of Iowa, menbera elected to fill vacancies. pre sented themselvet and took the oath. Mr. Hill introduced a bill to rtpeal the income tax. Referred to the com- 1 mittee on'Ways and Means. Similar bills were introduced by j Messrs. Kellogg and Myers. A resolution for now drawing for seats, offered by Mr. Stiles, was tabled by a rote of 92 to 82. The bill passed by tbe Senate at the last session, extending the time for the ; construction of a railroad from the St. j Croix river or lake to the west end of Lake Superior and to Bayfield, came up : as the regular order of business in the morning hour. It extends the terms of the grants for seven years from the 1st of May, 1866, provided that thirty miles be completed within eighteen months and thirty miles every year thereafter. The bill was explained and advocated ( by Mr. Wilson, of Minnesota. The bill was further explained and advocated by Mr. Washburn, of Wi9 consin, who stated in reply to the ques tions of Mr. Welker, that the length of this road was originally three hundred and fifty miles. Nearly two hundred miles are already completed and in running order and the remainder under contract, and that the quantity of land j required would be about one million j acres. Mr. Wood opposed the bill, declaring it to be a continuation of the swindling system by which the public lands have been given away to private cerpora tions. Mr. Julian desired to have the bill amended so as to exclude timber laud from the grant. i Mr. Lawrence desired to have coal j and iron land excluded, and to require ' the railroad company to sell ihe land to . actual settlers only", and in quantities j not exceeding a quarter section and not [ exceeding $2.50 an acre. Mr. Wilson argued that as it is now j admitted that the public lands should I go to the actual settlers, Congress should j adopt that policy which would prove j the most advantageous to the settlers. I and that was the opening of communi cation by railroads. After further discussion the bill was j laid on the table. Mr. Logan asked leave to introduce j and put upon its passage a hill abolish- j ing the offices of Admiral and Vice j Admiral of the navy, the former at j once, and the latter when a vacancy oc curs. Mr. Ilale object. Mr. Logan thereupon gave notice that he would move on Monday next to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The followingresolutious were offered: By Mr. Eldndge, calling on the Presi dent for information sis to the stationing of Federal troops in Montgomery, Ala.; to prevent the Governor-elect from taking possession and entering on his duties of office, and as to stationing of troops atother places with out the requesb of the Legislature or the Executive, for the purpose of sup pressing domestic violence. By Mr. Banks, calling for the corres pondence between the Navy Department and Rear Admiral Poor, from January to June, 1870, relative to the searching of American vessels by the Spanish authorities. Adopted. By Mr. Haldeman, instructing the Census committee to inquire into the complaints as to the accuracy of the late census, and whether the reliability of the basis of representation is thereby affected. Adopted. The President's message was distrib . uted among the several committees. The House, at 3:15 o'clock adjourned 1
