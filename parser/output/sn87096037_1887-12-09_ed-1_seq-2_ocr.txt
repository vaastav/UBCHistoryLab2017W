PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Devoted to. the Consideration of the Tariff and Surplus. Urging the Neceraily of a Revision of ttie Revenue as the Oaly Remedy for a Dangerous Evil—Method* Suggest ed by the Executive. FULL TEST .OF* THE MESSAGE. WASHINGTON, Dec. D—The following is the lull text of President Cleveland's mes sage, as read to both houses of Congress to day: To THE 

CONGRESS OF TUE UNITED STATES— You are confrontevl ut tbe threshold of your legislative du ies witsi a conditiou of tne Na* tional finances which imperatively demands im mediate und careful consideration. The amount of money annually exacted th.ough tho operation of present laws, from the iiutusir.es and necessities of tbe people, largely exci eds the sum neoessa. to meet tiie expeuses of the Government. When we consider that the theory of our in stitutions guarantees to every oitizen the fuil enjt yment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be h.s share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Government wli ch pro tects him, it is plain that the exaotion of more than this is indefensible extortion, and a culpa ble betr yal of Amer.can fairness and justice. This wrong, lnti cted upon those who bear the burden of National tax itton, l.ke other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil conse quences. The pubic treasury, which should oniy ex st as a lonuuit conveying the people triuute to .ts leg.timate objects of expenditure, become^ a hoarding-place lor money ucedesaly withdrawn from trade and tbe people's use, thus crippling our National energies, suspend ing our country's development, preventing in vestment in productive enterpnses, threaten ing financial disturbance and inviting schemes of public plunder. This condition of our Treasury is not altogether new and it has mure than once of late been submitted to the people's representatives in Congress, who alone can apply a remedy. .And yet the situa tion still contiuues, with aggravated in dents, more than ever piesag ng financial convulsions and w.de-spread disaster. It wili not do to neglect this situation cause its dangers are not now palpably immi nent and apparent. They exst none the less certainly, and awa.t tbe unforeseen, unex pected occasion when suddenly they will be piecipi:ated upon us. On ti.e frith day of June, 1885, the ex.ess of revenues over public expenditures, after com plying wtth the a nuul requ rement of the Sinking-fund act, was 4l7.fri^735.84 during the yo. ended June Jtt, 1 60, sucb excess amounted to $49,405,54).20, and dur.og the year euded June 00, 1887, it reached the sum of &>5.667,841V 64 The annual contributions to the sinking fund during the three year* above specified, amount ing in the aggregate to «138,058,&20.94, and de ducted from the surpius as stated, were made I calling in for that purpose outstanding 8 per nt. bonds of the Government. During the six n.o..ihs prior to June 30, 1887, tiie surplus rev enue had grown so large by repeated accumu lations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people, would sc uffeot tl.e business o( the country,that tbe sum of .79,861,1 0 of |such surplus was applied to the payment cf'the principal and interest of the 8 l-er cent! bonds still outstanding, and wh ch were then payable at the option of the Govern nt. The precar ous condition of financial affairs among the people still needing relief, immediately after the 30th day of June, 1887, tbe remaiuder of the S per cent, bonds then outstanding, amounting, with principal and in terest, to the sum of $18,677,600, were called in and appl.ed to the sinking-fund contribution for tho current fiscal year. Notw thstanding these operations of the Treasury Depart ment, representations of distress in business circles, not only continued but increased, and absolute peril seemed at baud. In these circumst .aces the contribution to the sinking fund for the cuneat fiscal year was at oncc completed*by the expend ture of &T,ti34,'.83.65 in the purch.ise of Government bonds not yet ue bein^4and4^ per cont. inter est, the premium pa theron averaging about ti per cent, for the former and 8 per cent, for the latter. In addition to this the interest accruing dui irg tbe current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the Government was to some extent ant.oipated, and banks selected as depositor es of public money were permitted to somewhat increase tueir deposits. While tbe exped.ents thus employed to re lease to the people the money lying idle in the treasury served t.» avert immediate danger, our 6uri lus revenues have continued to accumulate, the ex ess forthe present year amount ng on the first day of December to £6,8 8.701.19, and est mnted to reach the sum of tll£,ax),uoo on the r.9th of June next, at which date it is ex pected that th sum, added to prior accumula tions w:ll, swell the surplus in the Treasury to tl40.0j0,000. There seems to be no assurance that with such a withdrawal from use* of the people's cicttlating medium our business may not in the near, futme be subjected to tbe same distress which was quite' lately produced from the same oause. And while the func tions. of our National Treasury should be few and simple, and while its best con dition would be reached, I believe, by its ent re disconnection with pri vate business interests, yet when, by a perver sion of its purposes, it idly holds money use lessly subtracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the cla'm that some legitimate means should be devised by the Government to restore in an emergency, without waste or extravagance, such money to its place among the people. If such an emergency arises there now exists no clear ard undoubted executive power of re lief. Heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent, bonds, which were payabie at the option of the Government, has afforded a means for the nis bursement of the excess of our revenues but these »nds have all been retired, and there are -no bonds outstand ng the payment of which we have the right to insist upon. The contribu tion to the sinking fund whioh furnishes the oc cas on for expenditure in the purchase of bonds has been alrendy msde for the-current year, so there is no outlet in that direction. In tbe present state of legislation the only pretense of anv existing executive power to re store at this time any part of our surplus rev enues to the people by its expenditure, cons sts in the supposition that the Secretary or the Treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of the Government not yet due, at a rate of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of law from wh:ch such a power could be derived is found in an appropri ation bill passed a number of' ye^rs ago and it is subject to the suspic.on that it was intended as temporary and limited in its application, in stead of conferring a continuing discretion and author.ty. No condition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single official, upon his judgment of its necessity, to thhold from or release to the business of the people, in an unusual manner, money held in the Treasury, ar.d thus affect, at his will, the financial situation of the ountry and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary of the Treasury the authority in the present junct ure to purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested, and provided, as far as possible, with such checks and limitations as will define tfrs official's right and discretion and at tho same time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to circulation the surplus money accumulating iu the Treas ury. it should be borne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held as investments which can not be pur chased at any price, and that complications among holders,who are willing to sell may un reasonably enhance the cost of such bonds tb the Government Tt has been suggested that the present bond ed debt might be refunded at a less rate of in terest, and the difference between the old and new securities paid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the Treasury. The success of this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon the volition of the holders of the present bonds and it is not entirely certain that the induce ment which must be offered them would re sult in more financial benefit to the Govern ment than the purchase of bonds, while the lat ter proposition would reduce the principal of the deb* DV actual payment, instead of extending it The proposition to deposit the money held by the Government in ban 'k throughout the coun try for use by the people is, it seems to me, exceedingly objectionable in rrinciple. as es tablishing too close relationship between the operat'ons of the Government treasury and the business of the country, and too extensive a co-mingling of their money, thus fostering an unnatural reliance in private business upon public funds. If this scheme should be adopt ed it should only be done as a temporary exped ent to meet an urgent necessity. Legis lative and executive effort should generally be in tbe oppos.te direction, and should have a ten dency to divorce, as much and as fast as can safely be done, the Treasury Department from pr vate enterprise. Of course it is not expected that unnecessary end extravagant appropriations will be made for tbe purpose of avoiding tho accumulation of an excess of revenue Such expenditure, beside the demoralization of all just concep tions of public duty wbich it entails, stimulates a habit of reckless improv dence not in the least consistent with tbe mission of our people or the high and benefioent purposes of onr Government I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen, as well as to the attention of their representatives charged with the responsibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our financial situation. The failure of tbe Congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the difficulty must necessarily produce, caused a condition of financial dis tress and apprehension stnoe your last ad journment which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within executive con trol and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued Inaction of Congress, tbe responsibility must rest where .it belongs. Thouirh the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which sbould be fully realized, and though it presents features of wrong to the people as well as per.l to the country, it is but a'result growing out of a per fectly ^palpable and apparent cause, constantly reproducing tbe same alarming circuxnstanoes —a congested National treasury aa I a depleted monetary condition i:iihebusine» or the coun try. It need hardly be stated wia while the present situation demands a rerne .y, we can only be saved from a like predicament in the future by the removal of its cause. Our scheme of taxat on, by means of which this needless surplus is taken from the people and put into the pu. iic treasuiy consists of a tariff or duty evied upon importations from abroad, aud internal-revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spir.tuous aud mult liquors. It must be conceded that none of thJ things subjected to internal-revenue taxa tion aie, str ctly speaking, necessaries there appears to be no just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. But our present tariff laws—the vicious, in* equitable and illogical source of unnecessary taxation—ought to be at once revised and amend ed. These Uws, as tneir primary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all arti cles imported anu subject to duty, by pre cisely tue sum paid lor such duties. 

THUS the amoaut of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purohase for use the^e imported ai tides. Ma*iy of tiieso things, how ever, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and the duties now lev.ed up on forcigu goods and products are called pro tection .to taese home manufactures, because they render it possible for those of our people who are manutacturers to make these taxed articles and sell tbem for a price equal to taat demanded for tbe imported goods that have p.. customs duty. So it happens that while comparatively a few use tbe imported articles, millions of our people, who never use and never saw any of the lore.gu products, purchase and use things of the same kindAiade in this country, und pay there for nearly or qu te the same enhanced price which the duty acids to the imported articles. Tuose wuo buy imports pay the duty charged tuereon into the public tieasury, but the great majority of our cit*zeus, who buy domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least approximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. Tuis reference to the op eration of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruct on, but .n order that we may be con stantly remiuded of the manner in which they impose a burden*uj on those who consume do mestic products as well as those who consume imported articles, and thus create a tax upon all our people. It uot pioposed to entirely relieve the couutry of this taxation. It must be exten sively continued as the source of the Govern ment's income and in a readjustment of our .r:ff the interests of American lauor euxa^o.i in mauutuciure should be care fully considered, as well as the preserva tion tf our xnauufacturers. It may be called protection, or by any other name, but relief from the hardships aud dan ,ers of our present tariff laws should be devised with espec al precaution against imperiling tha ex istence of our manufacturing interests. But this existence shou not mean a condi tion which, without regard to the pub hb welfare or a uatioual exigency, must al ways insure tne real zation oi immense profits instead of moderately profitable returns. As he volume and divers ty of our National activities increase, uew recruits are udded to those who desire a continuation of the advantages which they conce.ve the eseut system of tariff taxation directly affords them. So stub bornly have all efforts to reform tLe present condition been resisted by those of our fellow citizeus thus engaged, that they can hardly complain of the susp on, entertained to a cer tain extent, that there exists an orgauized com bination all along the line to maintain their ad vantage. We are in the midst of centennial celebra tions and with becoming pride we rejo.oe in Amer can skill and ingenuity, in American en ergy and enterpriser and in the wonderful nat ural advantages and resources devel oped., by a* century's National growtu. Yet when an attempt is made to justify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer iu the land for the benefit of our m.nuiacturers, quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to call our manufactures infant ndustries, still needing the highest and greatest :gree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung irom Federal leg:slat.on. It is also said that the increase in the price of domestic manufactures resulting from the present tariff is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our working men employed in manufactories than are paid for what is caned the pauper labor ot Europe. Ail will acknowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our laboring people. Our labor is honorable in the eyes of every American citizen, and as it lies at tho foundation of our development and progress, it is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. Tne standard of our laborers' life should not be measured by that of any other country less favored, and they are entitled to their full share of all our ad~ vantages. By the last census it is made to appear that of the 17,88^1)99 of our population engaged in all kinds of .dustries, 7,67^,493 are employed in agriculture, 4,074,&8in professional aud per sonal service (2,984,876 of whom are domestic Servants and laborers), while 1,810,290 are em ployed in trade and transportation and 3,887^112 are classed as employed manufaoturinr and min ng. For present purposes, however, the last num ber given should be considerably reduoed. Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be concedcd that tbere should be deducted from those which it includes 375,144 carpenters aad joiners, 2ft ,401 milliners, dressmnkers and seamstresses, 172,7»6 blacksmiths, 183,736 tailors and taiioresses, 102,473 masons, 76.241 butchers, 1,309 bakers, 08) plasterers, and 4,891 engag ed in manufacturing agricultuial implements, amounting in the aggregate to 1,214,023, leaving 2,023,089 persons employed iu suoh manu facturing industries as are claimed to pe benefited by a high tariff. To these the appeal is made to save their em ployment and maintain their wages by resisting a change. There should be no dis position to answer such suggestions by the alle gation that they are in a minority among those who labor, and therefore should forego an 'ad vantage, in the interest of low prices for the majority their compensation, aB it may be af fected by tbe operation of tariff laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept in view and yet with slight reflection they wili not over look the fact that they are consumers with tne rest that they, too, have their own wants and those of their families to supply irom their earnings, and that the price of the necessaries of life, as well as the amount of tbeir wages, will regulate the measure of their welfare ana comfort But the reduotion of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the workingman nor the lessening of his wages and the profits Btill remaining to the manufacturer after a necessary readjustment, should fur nish no excuse for tbe sacrifice of tbe interests of his employes either in their oppor tunity to work or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the worker in manu factures fail to understand that while a high tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wages, it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sorts of manufactures, which, in almost countless forms, he needs for the use of himself and his family. Ho receives at tbe desk of his employer his wages, and per haps before he reaches his home is obliged, in a purchase for family use of an article which em braces his own labor, to return, in ihe payment of the increase in price wh.ch the tariff per mits, the hard-earned compensation of manv days of toil. The farmer and the agriculturist who manu facture nothing, but who pay the increased pr ce whi( the tariff imposes, upon every agri cultural implement, upon all he wears and upon all he uses and owns, except the increase of his flocks and herds and such thm.s as his hus" bandry produces from the soil, is* invited to aid in mninta.ning tbe present situation and he is told that a high duty on importi wool is necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear, in order that the price ot their wool may be increased. They, of course, are not reminded that the fnrmerwho has no sheep 1b by this scheme obliged in his purchases of clothing und woolen goods, to pay a. tribute to his fellow farmer as well as to the manufacturer and njerchant nor is any men tion made cf the fact that the sbeep-owners themselves and their households must wear clothing and upe other articles manufactured from the wool ihey sell at tariff pr ces, and thus, as consumers, must return their share of this Increased price to the tradesman. I think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks numbering from twenty-five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is 10 cents eaon pound if ot the value of 30 cents or less, and 12 oents if of the value of more than 80 cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be sixty or seventy-two cents, and this may be taken as the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dol lars would thus represent the increased price of the wool from twenty-five sheep, and SS6 that from the wool of fifty sheep, and at present values this addition would amount to about one-third of its price. If, upon Us sale, Jhe farmer receives this or a less tariff profit the wool leaven his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in all its changes will adhere to jt until it reaches the consumer. When manu factured into cloth and other goods and materi al for use, its cost is not only increased to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit but a further sum has been added for tne benefit of the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws. In the meantiznei the day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe himself &pd family for the winter^ When he faoes the tradesman for that purpose he discovers that he is ooliged not only to return, in the way of Increased prices, his tar tt profit on the wool he sold, and whlob then perhaps lies be fore him in manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in the «fhd he is aroused to the fact that be has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of the tariff scheme—which, when he sold his wool, seemed so profitable an increase in price—more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers e.ig.iced in wool-raising is compared with all the farmers in the country, and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered when it it made apparent tfeat, in the ease of a large part of t&oit Who own sheen, tha benefit ot the present tariff on wool is 11* lUBorv and, above all, when it must be oon ct^ltid that the lnorease of the cost of ltv* ing caused by suoh tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate means and the poor, the Qjnployed and unemployed, the sick ana well, and tbe young and old, and that it oon st tutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is fastened uponthe clothing of eveiy man, wom an and child in tbe land, reasons are suggested why the removal or reduction of this duty should be included in a revision of our tariff laws. In Bpeaking of the inoreased cost to the con sumer of our home manufactures, resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of tbe same description, the tact is not overlooked that competition among our domestic producers scmet mes has the effect of keeping the prioe of tbeir pioducts below the highest l.mit allowed by such duty. But it 4s notorious that this com* petition is too often strangled by combinations quite prevalent at this time and frequently called trusts, which have for tbeir object the regulation of tbe supply and price of commodi ties made and sold by members of the combina tion. The people can hardly hope for any con sideration in the operation of these selfish schemes. If, however, in the absence of such combina tion, a healthy and free competition reduces the price or any particular dutiable article of home production below the limit which it might otherw.se reach under our tariff laws, and it with such reduced price, its manufacture con tinues to thrive, it is entirely evident, that one thing has been discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxa tion. The necessity of combination to maintain the price ot any commodity to the tariff point fur msnes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity, ana that such pi-ices are remunerative and lower prices pro duced by competition Drove the same thing. Thus, where either of these conditions exist a case would seem to be presented for an easy reduction of taxation, Tbe considerations which have been present ed touching our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues of the Government be pre vented by the reduotion of our customs duties, and,at the same time, to emphasize a suggestion that, in accomplishing this purpose, we may discharge a double duty to our people by grant ing to them a measure of reliet from irilT tax ation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can the presentation made of such considerations be, with any de ree of fairness, regarded as evidence of tin riendliness toward our manufacturing inter? ests, or of any lack of appreciation of their value and importance. These Interests constitute a leading and most substantial element of our National greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress. But if, in the emeigency that presses upon us, our manufacturers are asked to sur render something for the public good and to avert disaster tbeir patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of advantages already afforded, should lead them to willing co-opera tion. No demand is made that they shall fore go all the benefits of governmental regard but they can not fail to be admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened self-interest and safety, when they are reminded of the fact that financial panic and oollapse. to which the pres ent condition tends, afford no greater shelter or protection to our manufactures than to our other important enterprises. Opportunity for safe, careful and deliberate reform is now of fered, and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irr.tated people.heed less of those who have resisted timely and rea sonable relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs. The difficulty attending a wise aad fair re vision of our tariff laws is not underestimated. It will require on the part of the Congress great labor and care, and especially. broad and Na tional contemplation of the subject and a patri otic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable and reckless of the welfare of the entire country. Under the present laws more than four thou sand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures, and many are hardly worth at tention as subjects of revenue. A considerable reduction can be made in the aggregate by ad ding them to the free list The taxation of luxuries presents no features*of hardship but the necessaries of life used and consumed by all tbe people, the duty upon which adds to the eo6t of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened. The radical reduction of the duties imposed upon raw material used in manufactures, or its free importation, is of course an important factor in any effort to I educe the price of these necessaries it would not only relieve them from the increased cost caused by the tar.ff on such material, but the manufactured 'product, being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such prod uct as a compensation to our manu factures for the present price of raw material oould be accordingly modified. Such reduction, or free importation, would serve beside to large ly reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how suoh a change can have any injurious effect upon our manufactures. On the contrary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of oth 6r countries who cheapen their wares by free material. Thus our people might have tiie op portunity of extending tleir sales beyond the limits- ofhomeTOdhsumpt-on, saving them from the depression, interruption in business and loss caused by a glutted domestio market, and affording the employes more certain and steady labor, with its resulting quiet and con tentment The Question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached in a sp.r higher than partisanship, and considered in the light of that regard for patriotio duty which should characterize- the action of those intrusted with the weal* of a confiding people. But the obligation to declared parly policy and principal is not wanting to urge prompt and ef fective action. Both of the great rolitical par tes now represented in the Government have, by repeated and authoritative declarations* condemned the condition of our laws which per mit the collection from the people of unneces sary revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised its correction and neither as cit zens or partisans are our countrymen in a mood to condone the deliberate violation of these pledges. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It is a con dition which confronts us, not a theory. Relief from this condition may involve a slight reduction of the advantages which we award our home productions but the entire withdrawal of such advantages sbould not be contemplated. The question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant: and the per* sistent claim made in certain quarters, that all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and un necessary taxation are schemes of so-called free-traders, is mischievous and far removed from any consideration the for public good. llie simple and plain duty whioh we owe the people Is to reduce taxation to the necessary ex penses of an economical operation.of the Gov ernment aad to restore to the business of tbe country the money which we hold in the treas ury, through the perversion of governmental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our industries, without danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor wbich our working-men need, and with benefit to them and all our people, by cheapening their means ofsubsstence and increasing the meas ure of their comforts. The constitution provides that tbe President "shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union." It has been the custom of the Executive, in compliance with this provision, to an Ually exhibit to the Congress, at the opening of its session, the gen eral condition of the country, and to detail, with some part cularity, the operations of the differeut executive departments. It would be especially agreeable to follow this course at the present time, and to call attention to the valuable accomplish ments of tbese departments during the last fiscal year. But I am so much impressed with .the paramount importance of the subject to whioh this communication has thus far be9n devoted, that I shall forego the add tion of any Other topic, and oniy urge upon your immediate consideration the "state of the Union" as shown in the present condition of our Treasury aad our general fiscal situation, upon which every clement ot our safety and prosperity de pends The reports of the heads of departments which wUl be submitted, contain full and ex plicit information touching the transaction of the business intrusted to them, and such recom mendations relating to legislation in the public interests as they deem advisable. I ask for these reports and recommendations the delib erate examination and action of the lecrislative branch of the Government There are other subjects not embraced in the departmental reports demanding legislative consideration, and whioh I should be glad to submit Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous messages, and as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recom mendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the Department of State, a brief history of the transactions of that important depart ment together th other matters whxh it may hereafter be deemed esssential to commend to the attention of the Congress, may furnish the occasion for a future communication. ..
