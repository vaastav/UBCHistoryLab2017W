He has been in Topeka for one vear and will refer van tn mnr than nn KT.'hl Tnnolr. nnL . . j 508 Kansas Ave., Ind, Phone 1432 Red There are some wonderful cu-es which the professor has made ecently. On lady, who made me promise I would not men J!on ner name, said: "I came from the hospital and was told there was no help for me by the doctors. I read Professor Peasley's add in the Journal and . concluded I would try him, knowing he could make me no worse, for I had been an in valid for 7 years and had doctored with the best doctors I could And, and got no relief from any of them. Some doctored for , cancers, others for tubercular tr ouble, and others for all Im aginable diseases, but I still kept getting worse. But after I had taken treatment of the professor for 3 weeks I began to get ao I could eat and began to get stronger, till today I feel like a new woman. I am now almost well. I do all my own work, and surely would be glad to recommend his treatment to anyone who is sick and suffering." This Is but a sample of the many who were more than glad to teU of the wonderful ' cures he is making. Mrs.8. M. Crow of 316 West 7th street, says: "I was help less with rheumatism '-and neuralgia pains: I - eould not even dress myself; I had to be waited, on Just as if I were a little child. J treated with -the-best physicians I could find, but I got no relief from any of them. I was discouraged, for I thought my time of living was short, and it would have been but a question of a few days till I would have died if I had not got PROFESSOR PEASLBY to begin treating me. He had given my but three treatments until I began to improve, re gardless of the fact that 2 had no confidence In any kind- of treatment any more. I -want to say to anyone who Is afflicted with HI health, this man Is a wonder; he surely will help you If he treats you.-. He is not a magnetic healing quack, or fake. but is the professor that he claims to be. He has cured me till at the present time. I have neither an ache nor pain. I get around the house as good as any one, and do all my own housework, and feel' fine. Anyone wanting to know about his treatments, I will be, very glad to recommend him, and will say he la very reasonable in his charges. I have paid many doc tors many times wow than I have paid him, and got no re lief whatsoever." Mrs. S. M. Crow, J. H.

They give you the best for your money SOLD BY ALL GOOD GROCERS NEW BOOKS. Mrs. McCarter's novel, "The Price of the Prairie," is proving a surprise, even from those of her friends who were satisfied it would prove success ful. It Is now in the fourth edition and one Topeka firm, Hall's, has sold 2,500 copies and has been compelled to telegraph to dealers to supply the orders. It will undoubtedly be one of the best holiday "sellers." The following from the Cincinnati Enquirer indicates that Mrs. Margaret Hill McCarter's book is attracting favorable attention in other states: There are more books deserving of note circulated than many are prone to concede. "The Price of the Prairie," for one, is one of the best accounts of life on the old western frontier that we have read. There is a distant smack of Churchill's "Coniston" in the general method, and a trace possibly of Mary E. Watts. But Margaret Hill McCarter's splendid book is yet all her own, and Phil Baronet, whom she impersonates, proves a very delectable community historian. And the whole large canvas of the life in the Neosho valley, in, the Kansas of the sixties and later, is as romantically stirring as anything of the sort that has come under our notice. One Is captivated, in fact, by the true, deep, sympathetic insight that marks the work,and the book is one that it does one good to read. It chiefly deals with events natural at the momentum period of the story's setting, in a plains settle ment. Sprlngvale was at the time of its' transition from being a trading poet. . Its citizens, those the war had left, were facing stern realities, such as the Plains Indians, the worst tribes in the southwest, whom the Confed eracy sought, they say, to Incite to ravage it and other towns, sending a score of commissioned officers to direct them in the errand but instead to be pierced by Osage arrows. And Phil's moving, if long-drawn-out, tale of his long disappointed love for Marge Whateley, a girl orphaned by her gal lant lather's death at the front, stands out dramatic against that background. His patient, watching over her, at the dead soldier's injunction, his low whistles, answered each evening by a responsive flicker of lamplight, while Jean Pabusca, a half-breed, represent ing Father Le Claire's secret and the cause of the good priest's solicitude, was also watching, on guard, by a great circle of lilac bushes transport ed from Ohio, are, however, a prelude to bitter suffering. But the setting forth of such pathetic sidelights does not tire one. The picture is caught in its whole perspective for such pathetic interrupting episode. The plains wore no constant smile in those days of danger, in that town of Union senti ment. Even the news of Gettysburg or Vicksburg was not so heartrending. It was not an unmixed blessing. For it meant many a vacancy in the ranks of the company the town had put in the field. She has assuredly found a theme that she knows well how to treat. Its full appeal is borne to one through her art in its treatment. Her character work is excellent. "A classic that ' will never die" is one appreciative Boston critic's opin ion of Eliza Calvert Hall's famous "Aunt Jane of Kentucky" short story "Sally Ann's Experience" which is now one of the best selllngg inexpensive books of fiction for holiday gifts. , Napoleon's self-assurance and abso lute independence are still brought out in the following extracts ftom "The Corsican; A Diary of Napoleon's Life in His Own Words," Just published by Houghton Mifflin Co. "Josephine is always afraid I may fall seriously in love; she doesn't realize that love was not made for me. - For what is love? a passion that leaves the universe on one side, to place the loved one on the other. And surely snch an exclu sion is not in my character. . . Friendship Is only a word; I love no body; no, not even my brothers. Per haps Joseph a little, even then it's a matter of habit it's because he is my elder. Duroc? Ah, yes, I love him; but why? His character at tracts me: he is cool, dry, severe and Duroc never sheds tears. As for me, you don't suppose I care; I know per fectly well I have no real friends. As long as I remain 'what I am, I shall have as many as I need so far as the appearance goes. Let the women whimper, that's their business, but for me, give me no sentiment. A man must be firm, have a stout heart, or else leave alone war and government." No recent book on Boston has at tracted more favorable attention than "Romantic Days in Old Boston," by Mary Caroline Crawford, who has been termed "the city's most accom plished social historian." Taking up a more recent period than other books on old Boston, from 1822, when the town became a city, drfwn to the great fire of '72 and the peace jubilee of '76, Miss Crawford deals with events familiar to many of the inhabitants of the city, and of great interest to form er residents who now live in other parts of the world. Like Miss Craw ford's previous book, "Old Boston Days and Ways," her new one is note worthy for the large collection of old views and portraits selected with great discretion. Katherine Cecil Thurston, whose latest novel, "Max," was published this fall, is the only child of Paul Madden, mayor of Cork, and was born in that town. Educated at home by a gov erness, she showed no further qualifi cations for future authorship than a love of reading. However, it was at Yougal, near both Cork and her pres ent home at Ardmore, that the poet Spencer lived. Following the publica tion of Mrs. Thurston's first novel, "The Masquerader," she attained a recognized position as a novelist. She is the lover of two good things the exhilaration of walking through rain and mist over Irish moors, and ab solute sincerity In writing. Peter Newell, who has Just con tributed "The Slant Book" to the world's amusement, began his artistic career as a youth in a photograph gal lery. Later he studied at the New York Art League. It is perhaps not generally known that 'Mr. Newell has exhibited oil paintings at the New York Academy of Design. .A water color of his was purchased at the At lanta exposition to serve as the nu cleus of a gallery in that city. Most of his illustrative work, thoug"h it finely appears in black and white, is first done in color. He seldom works from a living model, though his little daughter is said to have suggested Alice in his illustrations for "Alice in Wonderland." His gift for Inven tion Is shown again in "The Slant Book," which is as much of an inno vation in publishing as "The Hole Book" was last year. Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company announce for publication in the early spring a memoir of the late John La Farge, with a study of his work, by Royal Cortlssoz. Mr. Cortissor, who is critic of art and literature of the New York Tribune, and the author of Im portant books upon art matters, has an intimate knowledge of Mr. La Farge and his work, based on a friend ship of some twenty years. The book, which was sanctioned by Mr. La Farge will embody recollections com municated by him to the author in manuscript, together with numerous notes of conversations, anecdotes, etc., making it a personal portrait of un usual vividness and authenticity. It will be fully illustrated with repro ductions of La Farge's work repro duced in photogravure. r Investigating Five Chinese. San Francisco, Deo. 10.

UPWARD MOVEMENT. It Starts on Stock Market After Tem ple Decision Is Made. New York, Dec. 10. The week in the stock market was devoid of inter esting developments until Friday when the decision of the federal court, enjoining the Temple Iron company as illegal, but sustaining the conten tions of the coal carrying roads which control it, started an upward move ment which -spread more or less gen erally throughout the list. The de cision was evidently regarded - as of vital importance in its interpretation of the interstate commerce laws and gave encouragement to the railway and 'financial interests. - President Taft's annual: message was ' .well re ceived but appeared to -have no influ ence on the market otherwise. Conditions, in industrial lines, show practically no betterment, with an in creasing belief that before long prices must be revised.' s Improvement was noted in various mercantile lines, resulting from: more seasonable weather. Local - - banks made additional shipments of cash to western and s outhern - points and money here shows more firmness:' Foreign exchange conditions indi cate early gold imports. Earnings of railroads are generally favorable. -Reductions of the St. Louis & South western preferred dividend reflected general heaviness of Gould properties. NOT
