Sinir.JtAN HOAR of Massa chusetts understands how to got himself talked about. IN A tuffof war Morearty's wind could bo rolled upon. It has never yet given out or shown any signs of weakness. Roonit Q. MILLS still refuses to talk. Nobody can blame him. There ia positively nothing for him to aay , and if there were the English language ia not equal to the emergency. NinitASKAS ailvor wedding anniver sary occurs in March , but thus far neither Governor Thayer nor the State Historical society has made any official suggestions for the celebration. GOVKUNOU THAYISU should now give Rome attention to the question of oil inspection , and lo.ivo that of Governor Boyd's citizenship to the supreme court. This advlco is gratuitous , and it is offered in good faith. TIIK Real Estate Owners association , which hns already accomplished a good work in behalf of bettor government , should interest itself in making sure that a grand jury shall bo convened fop the next term of the district court. SIXTY-VIVE members of the present house of representatives served in the union army and iifty-six on the other side. Of the laltor , all but one ( Follows of Now York ) are from the southern states. The confeds although in the minority have captured the speakorship. THE senate committee on finance re mains solid ns it was a year ago with John Sherman at its head , and no prob ability of * change. John Sherman will probably succeed himself and contlnuo to guide the financial destinies of the country in safe and conservative chan- nols. 

PATRIOTIC American oltizons wltnout regard to party should not fail to road President Harrison's dipcnssion of the gerrymander us it has boon applied to the selection of presidential electors in Michigan. An honest American cannot road what the president says without being immediately impressed by the force aud cogency of his reasoning. 

THOJIPSO.V , the lying London corre spondent at Valparaiso , has managed to make himself unpopular with all the for- olgnors in Chili. Ho has not succeeded in discrediting Minister Egan , but ho has helped to compromise ) Herr Gut- Bohmidt , tlio Gorman minister , as well as Mr. Kennedy , the minister from Eng land. A liar is always fully tuj dangerous - ous to his friends as to his enemies. ALDION W. TOUHOEK pronounces David Dennett Hill of Now York the greatest single-handed politician this , country him ever had. Ho might also have remarked that the governor-sen ator is the most export double salary ofllco holder in America as well as the best two horse bareback rider over entered - torod in a political raco. ITla nagd are Tariff Iluform and Preo Coinage and ho guides both without bridle , saddle , aurclnglo or olnoh , except a cinch on the democratic party. Tins friends of Commldsionor Morgan in this stnto and the country at largo will bo disposed to congratulate that ofllolont and oonsulontlous ollicor upon the following deserved oudorsomont plvon him In the president's message : The work In the bureau ot Indian affairs was perhaps never so largo ns now , by reason of the numerous uogatlatlous which have boon urocoouing with the tribes for a reduc tion ot the reservations , with the Incidental labor of making allotments , and was nevermore moro carefully conducted. FOR once TUB 13KK agrees with Isaac 8. nascall as regards the proposed park on the south side. Whllo Mr. IlAscnll Is personally Interested in property that la offered to the commission , wo cannot overlook the fact that thousands of working people who llvo in the Second ward want u breathing spot neat * their homos. The only question is whether the prlco asked for the property Is roa- conablo. That can readily bo deter mined by disinterested ox port a who are /uuiillur with the value of laud. Till ! The third annual message of Presi dent Harrison is a comprehensive re view of the administration of the gov ernment during ono of the moat ovont- ftil ycnrs in our recent history. It is moro voluminous than olthor of the preceding - coding messages of Iho present execu tive , but It is Interesting nnd Instruc tive throughout , ! * ! no citizen who would bo properly informed regarding the af fairs of the government , and also the viowsoftho president relative to ques tions that are matters of public dis cussion , should full to road it entire. Referring first to the work of the State department , which has rollccted great credit upon the administration and the country , in which the president Is justly entitled to a largo share , it is announced that pending reciprocity negotiations are well advanced , warranting th'J hope that before tlio close of the year further trade arrangements of great value will bo concluded. With regard to the arbitration of the IJering sea contro versy , all that remains to bo done for the completion of the convention is to ngroo on arbitrators , which can hardly involve a aorloud dllllculty. Another Interesting fact in our International relations is the oflk'iat announcement tlmt.tho outlines of an agreement have been reached with Gormuny look ing to equitable trudo conces sions in consideration of the con tinued free importation of her sugars. Although the correspondence referring to this arrangement is with hold , it is reported from Washington that Gormuny concedes a material re duction of the duty on American cereals. Regarding the Now Orleans affair , the president thinks tliuro is no doubt that a friendly conclusion is attainable , and in connection with this matter ho sug gests that it would bo entirely competent for congress to inalce olYonsos ntr.itust the treaty rights of foreigners domi ciled in the United States cognizable in the federal courts. The Chilian dllll culty Is discussed at length , and it is made clear that the government of the United States has acted throughout judiciously and in good faith. The re sult of the investigation into the assault upon American sailors is now being awaited , and also a satisfactory response by the government of Chill to the note of this government , and the presi dent informs congress that , if expectation as to these matters is dis appointed ho will by special mcrsngo again bring the matter to the attention of congress for such action as may bo necessary. The Chilian government cannot reasonably find anything in the president's reference to this issue to in vite its resentment , while on the other hand the American people will sec in it a determination to maintain the rights of this government. The views of the president regarding the duty of the government in connec tion with the construction of the Nicara gua canal will elicit a great deal of dis cussion. It may bo grunted that the president does not overrate the impor tance of that enterprise to the interests of the people of the \Jnited States , but still the expediency of the government involving itself in any way with the ilnancinl affairs of the canal company , oven to the extent of guarantee ing its bonds , will bo very conor- ally qucstionsd. While the gov ernment is still seeking sorao practic able way of settlement with the subsi dized railroads , and the promise of get ting what is duo it seems to grow less from year to year , public sentiment is not likely to bo inllucnccd in favor of making the government responsible for even the interest on $100,000,000 of Nicaragua canal bonds. When this en terprise was inaugurated and congress was asked to trivo it recognition the most positive assurance was given that no financial aid would be asked from the government. A domund for such aid , coming bo soon after the assur ance that none would bo wanted , may well create distrust as to the motive. President Harrison thinks that an ex amination of the statistics of the treas ury and a glance at the business of tno country will satisfy any impirtiul In quirer that the results of the tariff have disappointed the evil prophecies of its opponents and in a largo measure realized the hopeful predictions - dictions of its frionda. The fact Is , that our commerce , both in imports and experts - ports , was larger during the year after the present tariff law wont into effect than in any other year of our history , whllo as to prices most articles of general oral use are no higher today than when the tariff law wonMnto effect , and some nro cheaper. The president deprecates agitation for radical changes in the tariff and financial legislation ns likely to impede rather than liolp busi ness , and this view will bo concurred in , it is not to bo doubted , by a majority of the American pooplo. With regard to silver President Harrison risen adheres ( Irmly to the position with which Iho country is familiar. Ho ba- liovos that the increased volume of currency provided for under existing silver legislation was needed , and that it has resulted beneficially , but ho thinks the country cannot sately go any further with silver. "I am still of the opinion , " says the president , "that the free coinage of silver under existing conditions would disastrously affect our business interests at homo and abroad. Wo could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power of the gold and silver dollar in our mar kets , and In foreign trndo the stamp gives no added value to the bullion con tained in coins. " Ho urges that the farmers nnd laborers of the country have the highest interest thatovory dollar , paper or coin , issued by the govern ment shall bo as good as any other , and ho says that , bimetallism being the desired ona , the true friends of silver will bo careful not to overrun the goal and bring in silver monometallism with its necessary attendants , the loss of our gotd to Europe and the relief of the pressure therefrom by a largo paper currency. Congress could have no stronger warning iiguinst attempting to legislate for the free coinage of silver , nnd the country could have no bettor assurance thatsuuh legislation would moot defeat nt the hands of the executive , The piosldont favors u modified use of the telegraph in connection with the poital service , nnd urges thnt the policy adopted by the last congress for the encouragement - couragomont of the construction of steamship lines should bn continued. Ho- jrarding a navy , ho"oxprcs903 the opin ion that there should bo no hesitation in promptly completing Siich a navy as will oniiblo this country to display its Hug in nil seas for the protection of its citl/.ons nnd its extending commerce. The mes sage concludes with an extended discus sion of election methods , with spoolnl reference to the Michigan plan of choos ing presidential electors ami the gerry mandering of congressional dls- trlcU Regarding these expedients for the overthrow of majority control as our clilof national dnntror , the president suggests the pos sibility of constituting a muipartlsan commission to consider the question of the evils connected with our oleotlon system nnd methods nnd devise sonm- plan for removing or mitigating those evils. iK.lf > UXt > 70.1 ; .V.I IT. Secretary Tracy urges cogent reasons in support of the policy of constructing n navy adequate for defense and for thn protection of our commerce on the seas. Great progress law boon imulo In this direction during the present administra tion , but as yet only a good beginning hns boon made , and It Is impor tant , that the work shall not bo abandotiod or allowed to halt. There is danger , however , that the present congress , in its anxiety to make a record for economy , will neglect this mutter and permit the construction of a navy to stop with the completion of the vessels nlrondy authorized. Secretary Tracy lias wisely said that to n great commercial nation a strong navy is indispensable. This hns been the experience of all com mercial countries , and Iho course of events during the past year ought to have convinced the American people that this country cannot escape a likoi experience. Wo are rapidly extending our commercial relations and increasing our interests in every land. This neces sarily brings us into rivalry with other nations , seeking to extend their com merce , and in the very nature of things complications will grow out of this competition. It is apparent , says Secretary Tracy , that the mercan tile competitors of this country are today enlarging their Holds of activity with amore moro nggrcssivo energy than1 ever be fore. There is reason to believe , also , that they are making a systematic effort to take advantage of the disturbed con ditions in mnny of the smaller states , and it is not improbable are exerting their inliuonco to maintain such conditions wherever they may bo made inimical to the interests and aims of the United States. Evidence is not wanting that this has been the case In Chili , it may bo so in Brazil , and it is not to bo doubted that generally in South America European influence is being actively exerted against tbis coun try. The commercial ascendancy so long enjoyed by the nations of Europe in the southern half of the western hemisphere they will not bo deprived of without a struggle , nnd what they cannot accomplish by peaceful means they may employ other methods to achieve. In such a movement , says the secre tary of the navy , naval ascendancy plnys a largo part. Wo are practically helpless now. True , when our present authorized lleot is completed , wo ohall have a bettor and stronger navy than ever before , but wo shall still bo fur short of tin adqualo naval force to protect our own seaboards , to sny noth ing of pursuing an aggressive warfare , should that become necessary. Such a contingency may bo remote , but , as Sec retary Tracy well says , there are ele ments of danger nt all times for American interests , and at any moment these elements may bo rendered tenfold moro active by a European war. There could bo no greater mistake than to abandon the policy the country has entered upon of building up a navy which will enable this country , ns the president slates it , to display its flag in all sons'for the protection of its citizens and of its extending commerce. Byron tolls us in his tragic drama known as "Marino Paliori , " that there is a gallery in the Venetian palnco in which the walls are hung with the portraits traits of the successive doges of Venice. Most conspicuous among this collection of portraits is n panel that had boon sot apart for ono of these portraits. This panel is pilntod black * The visitor naturally inquires why this was done nnd ho is told that Marino Faliori , whoso portrait was thus blotted out , < had committed treason to the Venetian state and his memory was thus leapt , forever block. It will bo very much the same when people look upon the black lines drawn across the minority report on the Kotoh- am furniture job .us spread upon the journal of the city council , The black lines will only omphaslzo the fact that the expunged report embodied informa tion that was not urodltablo to certain members of the council. And in their zeal to cover up this unsavory record they followed up their whitewash with a bltickwnsh thai only makes the st.un moro pronounced. Mr. Mo-oarty has overdone the thing. Ho ought to have had sense enough to know that tho. expunged report has boon forever preserved in thn flies of the nowspanors and his effort to obliter ate it is puerile. 

TIIK i.iuit.iitv nUti.iH\n. The council has unanimously voted to accept the ground on the corner of Nineteenth nnd Harnoy for a public Hlrnry and museum with all the con ditions attached. Those conditions are such as no conservative business man would bo willing to accept. The lot is to revert to the hoira of the Into Byron Reed if ever the city should IIml the proposed museum and lib-arj building too contracted for the wants of a growing city. It is sife : to predict that wo shall hive outgrown n library building on a lot which , even with the proposed purchase of the adjoining ground , would only command ( )3xl ) > iH foot without an , iHoy. The new library building of Ba t MI covers un-nrca of0 feet uquu.ro and lias u court in the center 110 foot Btni.iro. In other words , the court in the % > ston library building will bo almost us Inrgo iw the Byron Reed lot nnd the lot adjoining. But that is not the worst feature. Ono of the pj idltions of the Rood be quest is tlitfltho library building shall bo n Hrst cliis-j , lire proof structure , four stories hlghyu nnd covering the entire lot. Now it Is conceded that these conditions cannot possibly bo complied with. The city does not want a library building four stories high. Such n building eajniptbp constructed for loss than $200,005rnnd wo only have $10- ! ) 000 at our disposal. A public library building should bo sur rounded by an open area for light on all sides. Tills cannot bo done because there Is no alloy in the roar ot the lot and if space is reserved in the roar of the lot , the conditions under which the bequest wns.inado will bo violated and the property will revert to the heirs. lyist , hut not least , the lot Is located near u creek bed and the ad ditional cost for foundations will exceed the value of the irround. The more fact that the people voted the bonds for a library building on Iho Rood lot does not justify the nc- coptanco of the conditions wlth , which the donation Is loaded down. Over 2,600 people voted against the proposition and wo venture to assort that the vote would have been almost unanin ous had tlio voters taken the trouble to look at the lot and inform themselves fully about thp fact that the property would some day revert to the holi-H of Mr. Rood unless the conditions which are attached thereto are complied with. o.v rut : itunir r/MC/f. The Central Labor union has ap plied for an injunction to restrain the mayor and council from entering into the contract awarded to the Kotcham Furniture company. In this action they will bo sustained by all classes of our citizens. All things being equal the contract should bo awarded to homo manufacturers. " The Kotcham company was not the lowest bidder. Its bid was higher than that of other bidders. The methods pursued in getting the contract were questionable and would vitiate the contract even if they bad made the low est and best bid. In the light of the revelations made during the recent investigation , the Central Labor union is fully justified in invoking the interference of the court , not only in the interest of homo wago- woricors but in-tho interest of good gov ernment. SOUTH OMAHA has organized a Busi ness Men's association. The first duty of the now organization should bo a thorough investigation of the municipal government in the interests of economy. A Business Men's association devoted merely to advertising the resources of the city will full far short of its.oppor- tuniticp. Economy ana elllcioncy in the local government is of the first im portance. - A PAitK on the banks of the muddy Missouri this side of Bellevue ewamps may bo remarkable for its savage grandeur nnd the beauty of its pond lilies and skunk 'cabbages , but as a re creation resort for south side citizens it would bo both inaccessible and unsatis factory. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ WOKKINGMEN of Omaha will hardly forgot the councilmen who voted to award a contract ] tainted with fraud to an outside firm when an Omaha con tractor who employs Omaha labor of fered to do the work contemplated for $2,000 loss than the outside firm. THE suggestion of the half-baked editor that the park bonds bo made payable in thirty year's gives .further evidence of his incompotoncy to deal with practical-questions.

The Hopubllc cannot bo oxpeotod to rejoice at this , or to record It without eravo apprehensions ns to the immediate f lit nro of the party. Minneapolis Journal ( dom. ) : Mr. Crisp's tenacious supporters are not Cleveland men , It Is true , but his success Is onlv considered n Waterloo for Cleveland by suporllclnl oh- servers. The fact that the Hill and Tam many influence assisted Crisp Is only llkoly to draw the Hub moro eonipicuously betwoou the Hill nnd Cleveland factions. Cnlcago News ( nul. ) : Mills has fallen at the hands of the Philistines. The ghost of the Cleveland administration may w ll wring Its shadowy digits and sbriok llko a banshee. It doted on Mills. It has root with n rude rebuff , whllo exultation Is rife In places not wholly given ever to the ndvocaey of tariff reform. Still , the victor has pledged him self to carry on that work. Denver News ( dem. ) : Mr. Crisp Is a thor ough frco coinage man. Ho is not half hearted in his ndvocaey of the measure. At the same time ho Is a tariff reformer In the true so.iso of the word not a free trader , but an advocate of Just such reform ns was em bodied In the Mills bill of 18S8. Tdo demo crats In congress nro to bo congratulated upon their choice for speaker. St. Paul Pioneer Press ( rop. ) : Mr. Mills was tuado the personal roprobontatlvo of the Cleveland democrats , most unwisely for tholr Interests , while Mr. Crisp stood for the op position. It Is not accurate to say thnt his canvas represents the Hill cnmmien , but rather the anti-Cleveland section of the party. It is the field against Cleveland , nnd iho Hold supported Crlip in the speakorsblp contest. Kansas City Journal ( rop. ) : The supporters of Mills mainly included the partisans of Cleveland , whllo among the supporters of Crisp were found the element that is partial to Hill. The tariff policy thnt may bo ex pected to follow In the wako of the success ol Crisp will bo embodied in a bill to simply repeal the McKlnloy law , ana the recogni tion of the silver question as a feature of the comma ; national campaign. Denver Sun ( rop. ) : The contest between Crisp and Mills was evidently aotermlnod nnd obstinate and must loavosomo bitterness behind. The presidential question was also somowbnt Involved In It. But if tbo result bo held to bo n trlumpn of moderate tariff reform - form ever extreme free traao. of Iroo coinage ever the single standard , of Hill over Cleveland - land , It at least cannot bo called n very great triumph. It will give Mr. Hill no overwhelming advantage ever his corpulent comnntltor. Chicago Tribune ( rep. ) : The success of Mr. Crisp is a defeat for Cleveland. It does not moan that ho will not bo the caunldato of bis party , but it makes It doubtful whether bo will bo permitted to wnto its platform. * * * With Mr. Crisp in the chair , elected by the class of mon Who stood by him , It Is safe to conclude that nothing radical will bo done about tbo tariff this winter. No general tariff bill will bo prepared , and while some little separate bills modeled after the Springer pattern may bo introduced , it is doubtful whether they will make much progress.
