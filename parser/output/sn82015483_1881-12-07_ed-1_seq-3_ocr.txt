A SHORT RECESS, The House Adjourns Over Until Friday, OR THE SELECTION OF COMMITTEES. Hie Drawing of Seats in the House. GUITEAU CLOSES HIS DEFENSE After a Bitter. Tirade Against His Counsel. THE KATIOKAL CAPITA!,. The Home Adjourns VmUI Friday Jfot Mach Business Until After the Holidays Favorable Comment on President Ar thur's Meaamge Hepcrts Abont the Com mitteesOther Matters. Wasbtkoton, Deo. 6. The Honse. has. taken a recess until Friday in order to allow Speaker Keifer time to prepare his commit tees. It is stated that .when the House meets on Friday it will immediately adjourn for some purpose until next Tuesday It is not expected business will be transacted to any extent in the House until after the holi days. The Senate being ready for business will of course do considerable committee work at once. No attempt will be made at present to change the present officers. Prominent senators think that no Cabinet nominations, except probably Frelinghuysen for secretary of state and .Brewster for At torney General, will be sent in before Janu ary. These two, and possibly some one as Postmaster General, are expected to-morrow or Thursday. A pair was secured to-day for Senator Ma- hone for the first time since he has been Sen ator. Senator Eollins has paired with Sena tor Gorman, reserving the right to transfer his pair in the event of either-being present. He accordingly made the transfer to Senator Mahone. some of the Democrats, since Mahone has received the endorsement of his State as the opponent of the regular Democ racy, are disposed to recognize him and a pair could probably be secured by him at any time now that the iee is broken. The business of the patent office since the beginning of the fiscal year, .July 1st, has shown a steady and rapid increase. The statement made to-day shows the receipts for the last month, to be $09,761.05 against t,l7Z.5U lor tne same month last year. being an increase in one month of $14,588.- 55. If a proportionate increase continues during the year the increase will amount to over $150,000. Comment regarding the President's message where it can be obtained is quite favorable. comparatively tew persons outside the mem bers have read it, and many members are un willing to express an opinion regarding it un til they have more carefully read and thor oughly digested, it; With those who speak of it, however, the expression is that it is a clear, concise, business-like document and able. It is especially commended for its pointed business-like qualities, and when the tact becomes generally known that it was written' without the aid of. Cabinet officers. save such information as their reports af forded, it will doubtless be more highly com mended. With Republicans and the maiori- ty of Democrats the comments are generally favorable. On the financial and other dis puted topics there are of course some who do not agree with the President's views, but trom tnese expressions of difference come with generally kindly expression. Much anxiety was felt in regard to the message and it was a subject of much inquiry during the eariy portion oi me aay. ino lengtn or tne document, however, prevented a sufficiently close reading to give general expression to night. The air is full of rumors to-nisht concern ing committee organization. It is generally conceded, that Kelly will go to the Ways and Means, miscoce to tne Appropriations, Dun- nell to the Commerce, Easson to the Foreign Relations. Harris, of Massachusetts, will probably go to the Naval committee ; Neal, of Ohio, to the District of Columbia ; Sher win, of Illinois, the Census. The latter has a resolution prepared recreating the Census committee which will frame a reaportionment. The bill also provides for a deficit in the cen sus bureau. Young, of Ohio, will have a prominent committee, probably Public Lands. Death of General Ktlpatrtck. Washington, Deo. 6. The Consul at Val paraiso telegraphs to the State department that Minister Eilpatrick died at Santiago last Sunday. Guiteau's Defense Closed Written alues- tlona to be Submitted to President Ar thur. Washington, Deo. C. In the Guiteau trial C. B. Farwell, of Chicago, testified to know ing Guiteau two years ago in Washington, when Guiteau came to him and asked him to advance $200,000 for establishing the Inter- Ocean, promising to make witness President of the United States. - He thought Guiteau then was not sane, but as to his power to distinguish between right and wrong he thought there was not irresponsible insanity. Mr. Gbrham now being present, took the stand and was given Guiteau's political speech to look over. Meanwhile Guiteau was per mitted to read aloud from his' book on Truth." to the amusement of the specta tors." Mr. Gorham having at lengtn Deen asked his omnion of the speech, answered that it was a tolerably fair statement of the situation, neither remarkable nor ridiculous. Guiteau began to asu mm in regard no certain editorials in the liemioucan last spring, mr. Gorham referred to the files for answers and was sustained by the court. Much time was consumed by obstreperous and insolent out breaks by the prisoner, the most violent oi which was directed against Mr. Sooville, and must have tried that gentleman's temper and patience severely. Mr. Scoville reeretted that President Ar thur could not be present to-day, and asked if his testimony would be admitted at a later date, saying he wished to snow mat jrresi dent Arthur considered the prisoner insane. A discussion between counsel here arose, and Guiteau again interrupted with almost un bearable insolence. It was suggested by the prosecution that certain written questions micht be submitted to President Arthur and his written answer accepted, thus obviating the necessity of calling the President into court. Mr. Scoville acceded to tne sugges tion, but left the impression that the matter would be dropped, and then proceeded- to read from some ox uuueau s ucerary ouurm. John Guiteau took the stand to make cor- rentinna and additions to his testimony to show the exact time when he changed his mind as to his brother 8 sanity. Mr. Scoville then said that the testimony for the defence was closed, but as he pro posed to use the prisoner's book in his argu ment, it was ruled necessary to introduce it ... . i 3 -L now, ana (jruiteau was set to reaumg ii. Mr. Kcovilla interrnDted to call Mr. E. C. Rnitzer. who failed to answer, and the read ing continued with increased rhetorical em phasis and loftily roundea points. Forty-Seventh Congress. Washington, Dec. . SKXATE.-7-MeBsrB. Beck andafsxey offered resolu tions directing the Committee on ..Judiciary to make a general investigation of tne law touching succession in ease of removal or Inability of tne President and Wednesday, the Uth inst. was Axed as the day for their discussion. - . A large comber of petitions were presented and bills Introduced mainly occupying the time until the mes sage. The message came in at one o'clock and was immediately read by the secretary. The reading of the message occupied an hour and forty-live min utes. Mr. Xdmnnds called up his resolution reviving and continuing the oommittees of the last session. David BaVia, the chair being occupied by Mr. Har ris, then took the floor and in a iJDg speech advocated a continuance of the committees as now constituted. ' Mr. Pngh said whan he offered his resolution yes terday he did so with the belief that an equal division of the oommittees would be equitable, but since hearing the speech oi the Senator from Illinois it would be but a waste of time to introdnoe it. A vote was then taken on the resolution as offered by Mr. Edmunds and it was agreed to, yeas 31, nays su ana at "ttve minutes past turee uhtosiimb. ad journed. -. ... , - Hoot. The only sport In the House to-day was when the members drew for seats, standing in the snaee behind the bars as their numbers were called, each .electing his preference. Wheeler, of Alabama, nTmnritirai tn whom was so intense vesterdav. came up rather smiling to-day when his same was nmiiftX nrst, ana ne naa ue pics ox um woun buw& b chose the third section midway on the Democratic side. Calkina, of" Tnt.n nd the choice on the Be publiean side. A large number of new members were called first and thus preempted many choice olaeea. On the Democratic aide Atkins. Carlisle, McLaae and Tucker all found early favor. Beed and Bobinaon, of New York, of the Bepublicans. secured excellent locations. Hewitt and Springer were es pecially fortunate in finding seats in a direct line with the Speaker's "eye. -Jiandau would have been badly left bad not Wheeler resigned in his favor, and whn Cox's name was called Wheeler vacated a sec ond time and Urns gave the member from Kew ltork favorable seat. Young, Morrison and Blackburn also fared well. Kelly, of Pennsylvania, was given his old seat by his oolleatrue. urtn. narrows, nasaeu. Sell and Blount were the last called, and will listen to the prayers of their political opponent In the Amen corner' in meepy nouow. After the readies of the message, which occupied two hours and fifteen minutes, Mr. MoKinley, of Ohio, introduced a resolution that a committee of one from each state be annointed to act wun a simi lar Senate committee to provide proper recognition of the President's death. - At 5:30 p. m. the House adjourned until rnaey. Doorkeener Brown low to-dav annointed B. W. Austin, of North Carolina, assistant doorkeeper, and Nathan Pickard clerk.

WEST. , . ' ' Illinois. An' Alarming Spread of Smallpox. Chicago, Dee. 6. The Medical Record for December says "Smallpox seems to be sweep ing over the country from the Atlantic coast westward to an extent not before observed during the present decade. The health re ports indicate that almost every city and country village throughout Kew England and the' Middle States is infected, while from Chicago west the alarm is auite general. The mild weather so far has been favorable, but with the comine month there is reason to ap prehend serious trouble. It is estimated that 30 per cent, of the 400,000 emigrants who landed here in 1881 are susceptible to the in fectious smallpox. The 2,000 cases in Chi cago this year were almost entirely confined to this incoming class." Kentucky. Beck Re-Kleeted to the Senate. Fbankpobt, Dee. 6.

David McMillan, who shot Father McCarthy, reached Green field at 6:15 to-night in charge of Officer Fitzgerald. Fears were entertained of an at tempt on the part of some of the enraged parishioners of Father McCarthy to lynch the prisoner, and by permission of Assistant Superintendent Turner of the Fitchburg road the train was stopped some one hun dred rod below the depot, and the prisoner with Officer Fitzgerald and another officer was taken into a- carriage and driven rapidly, to the jail.' News of this plan had, however, in some way leaked out and the yard before the jail was crowded with people anxious to get at thejprisoner. A committee from the Catholic church was, however, present and assisted the officers m preserving order and guarding the prisoner. The crowd was in earnest and closed around the team with shouts of "Pull him out !" "Pull him out." Shoot the villain !" but the gleaming re volvers of the officers deterred them from any actual application of force. McMillan was thoroughly frightened and fairly dragged the officer to whom he was handcuffed up the jail steps in his terror lest the crowd should seize him. He will be examined at noon to-morrow at the jail before Trial Justice Thompson on a complaint charging him with intent to kill. Father McCarthy, the wounded priest, passed a bad night Monday and grew worse to-day until late in the afternoon, when his physi cians gave up hope of his recovery. Should he die before Wednesday noon McMillan will be arraigned on a charge of murder. Municipal Elections in tne State. Boston, Dec. 6.

PENNSYLVANIA. Verdicts Against Star Routers. Philadelphia, Deo. 6. The prosecution of civil suits against the Star routers to re cover the loss sustained by the government was commenced in the United States District Court to-day. A verdict was obtained against Benjamin B. Wiley, bondsman for Thomas Davitt, for $5,700 , and in three cases a ver dict was obtained against McDavitt for $8, 700, $G,000 and $4,000 respectively. In the suit against Black, Blackman, Turk, Arbuckle and Cosson, by agreement between counsel, a verdict was rendered against each defend ant on contracts in which they were invalved of $1,975, $44, SB 4,156 and $3,018. A num ber of intricate law points and questions were taken into consideration by the judge. who will determine them upon arguments for new trials in all cases. The case against C. Price, one of the sureties upon Wiley's bond, went over because no Washington au thorities were present to prove that the con tract was hot performed. NEW 

TORE. A Steamship's Rough Pasaage. New Yoek, Deo. 6. The White Star steamer Celtic arrived this morning, five days overdue. She reports, having a most stormy passage. One lifeboat was washed away, the chocks going by the board like pipe stems. November 26 a heavy iron dooz leading to the quadrant house was stove in, the aft rail swept away and the grating around the quadrant house on the starboard knocked into splinters. The same destroyed the heavy sounding apparatus and cleared all the decks. A steerage passenger, Peter Thomp son, died on that date. The first offloer never made such a voyage. NEW DOMINION. Another Infernal Machine. Montbeax,, Deo. G. Another infernal ma chine was discovered to-day in the same lo cality as the first. The machine was wrapped up in the New York Pucjc, while the paper wadding inside consisted of a copy of the United Irishman. The machine had evident ly been there for some time. The charge ap peared spoiled, and when an attempt was made to fire it with gunpowder the dynamite refused to go off. The latest theory is that some young enthusiast has been experiment ing unsuccessfully. , MOVEMENTS OF STEAMERS. New York, Dec. C. Sailed, the Arizona for Liver pool.
