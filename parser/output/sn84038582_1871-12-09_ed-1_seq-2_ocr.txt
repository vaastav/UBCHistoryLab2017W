in OTTAWA FKEE TKADEK : SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1871. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. iniid Annual Message of Prident Giant to Congress. Delivered December 4 1871. Washingtox, December 4. The following U the President's Mess;', this day delivered to CongroM : To the Seu t aud House of Repre enUtirea: la addressing tot tbirJ annual Message to the law-nisliiug brauc.h of the Gorernwent, it U gratifying to be able to Mate that during the past year success has fc.euer..lly attruded tie effort to execute nil the laws found upan the Statute-book. Tbe poli y bu been uot to io quiro into the wi-uVtu of laws already enacted, but to learn their special intent, and to enforce them accordingly. The past year Jias, uuder wind Frovldcnce, been one of gem-rl prosperity to tv uUion. It has, however, been i:enJe.i with luoio than the usual ch.istibt iuin'' iu lues uf ttte stid prop erty by storm aud fiie. Tl en Jisi.-tera hro served to oall forth the best tlem-nt a liuui.u nature in tho couutry, aud to develop i Uiend ship for us n the prt oi foreign n.tioni, which goes far toward alleviating tbe distress occa sioned by the calumnies. The bonevoleut, who have so generously shircd their iMrnn with tbe victims of these misfortune, will rop their re ward iu the coriHi.'iousue of h iving performed a noble uot, receiving the grateful thauks of the Bien, women and children whose sufferings they have relieved. The relation of the United Sutoi with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has ben an evunttul oue ia witueseiug two great nations, speakiu oue language, and having one lineage, sottlin, by peaceful arbitration, dis putes of long standing and liable at any time to bring those n.tion into bloody and hostile conflict. An exaiupla has thus beeu set, which, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized natious, aud be tbe final means of returning to productive industry millions of men maintained to settle tho dispetes of nations by the bayonet aud broadsword. I transmit herewith u copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been concluded, since the adjournment of Congress, with Her Britannio Majesty, and a copy of the protocols of the conferences of the Commissioners by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the ques tions pendiug between the two nations. Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend Congress at an early day to make tho necessary provision for the tribunal at Ge neva, fud for the several Commissions on the part of tho United States, called for by the treaty. His Majesty the King of Italy, the President ef the Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty tho Emperor of Brazil, have each con sented, ou tho joint request ef tho two Powers, te name uu arbitrator lor the tribunal at Geneva. I Lave caused my thanks to bo suitibly ex pressed for tho readines with which the joint request has been complied with by the appoint ment of gentlemen of emiueuce and learning to theso important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Gyrmany, has been pleased to com ply with the joint action of the two Govern ments, and h.is consented to net as the arbitra tor of tho disputed water bouudary between the United States tnd Great Brittnin. The con tracting put ties in the treaty have undertaken to regard hs between thera-tlves certain princi ples of public law for which the United S: itt-s have contended lruin the commencement of their history. Thty have also agreed to bring these principles to tho knowledge of the other mari time powers, i. til to invite them to accede to them. Nooti itions f.ro going on as to tbe form of tho noto by which tho iuviUtiou is to be ex tended to the Powers. I recommend the legisla tion uece.s.-iiry on tho part of the United States to briug iuto operation the ar'telea of the treaty relating1 to Uo liberies, mid to I lm other mat ters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North Aruericau p is.esious, to beuoiuu operative us soon us the Drouer leiris. lation shall bo had ou the part of Great Britain and its position. 1- is much to b.' desired that this li';.'i-: i, ; ;ii m y become op.-i itiv. l foro thu liihtim.-u of :be United State-, luviu to xniko their armnu'i rcct'tj fur the OMtniru' season. Without exceeding tho numbor uf men or of expenditures authorized by law, during the past your, Mb navy has iu addition to iu regular ser vice, supplied th.; i:;pii :md officers for tlio vessels of the C i t Survty, aud has completed the sur veys autburix '1 by Congress of the Isthmus of Uarieu nnd Tehuiiatupeo, and, under liko au thority, has -t nt out bu expedition, completely funiifhKd and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the North. Tho suggestions of tho re port as to the necessity for increasing and Im proving the material ot the navy, aud the plan recommended fur reducing tho personnel ot the cervici! to a peico standing, by the gradual bo lition of eerluiu grades of officers, the reduction of others, aud tho employment of some in the commercial mariue, are well considered aud de Bervo tho thoughtful nttcution of Conuress. I also recommend that all promotions in the navy above tho rank of Ciptain be by selection in stead of priority. Tliis course will (-enure, in the higher (Trades, greater efficiency, huJ hold out un incentive to young officers to improve themselves in their profession. The present cost (if maintaining the navy, its cost compared with that of the prcceediug year, and thu esti mates for tie ensuing year, are contained iu the accompanying report of tho Secretary of the Navy. Tho enlarged receipts of tho lVt Oflico De partment, us shown by tho accompanying Ije. pott of the lVtni.iMor General, exhibits an in crease in that or inch of the publio service. It is tho index of tho growth of education and of the prosperity of the pr.ople two eleiuftnta highly conducive to tie vigor and HtMlity of republics. With a vat territory like ours much of it hpursi !y j)(,j,ui ,ttcl. but all requiring the eervioes oi tho mail, it is not at present to be ex pected that this department can bo made self sustunmn; but a gradual npproaob to this end, Ir-.iu year to year, is confidently relied unon, and IH d.y is ,1(,t f.r distant when the Post UiU- e D.-iunmuit of the Governinetit will prove h much great.r bl-jssintr to the whole people than it is now. .

Tliero lm b-(. imry'ed uon tho Executivo braneh uf i,e Ovrnmcit the rxerutiou of the act of Cnu'rc.., appiovnd April 10, 1'iTl, and comuiotily ktmwi, as the "Ku-Klos lav." ia a portica of the Stat ! ut South Carolina. The necessity of the course pursued will b demonstrated by the report of the committee appointed to investigate the Southern outrtget. Uader the provisions of the above act, I isued a proclamation, calling the attention of the people of the United State to the same, and declaring my reluctance to ex ercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except in the case of an im perative necessity, bat making known my pur pose to exercise euch powers whenever it should become necessary to do no for the purpose of se curing to all citizen of the United Statss the peaceful enjoyment ot the rights guaranteed to thfttn by the Constitution and the laws. After the passage ef the law information was received, from time to time, that combinations of the character referred to in thia law existed, and vere powerful iu many parU of the South ern Sutes, particularly in certain oountie iu the Sta-.e of South Carolina. Careful investiga tion w. a made, and it was ascertained that in nine cot nties of the State, such combinations wre active and powerful, embracing a sufficient portion oi the. citizens to control the local au thority, and having, among other thins, the ob ject of de( riving the emancipated class of the substantial WiefiU of freedom and of tirivileire. aud the fne politioal aotion of those citizens who did not sympathize with their own views, Among theii operations were freouent scour?. ings and occasional assassinations, generally per- peiraiea at nignt oy disguised persons, the via tims, in almost sll oases, being citizens of difbr ent political sentiments from their own, or free persons wbo had shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of inoffeusire and well-disposed citizens were the sunerers ty this lawless violence. Thereupon, on the loth of October, 1871, a proclamation was issue a. in term of tne law, calling upon the members of tbe combination to disperse within five days, and to deliver to the Marshal or mili tary offioeri of the United States all arms, am munitions, uniforms, disguises, and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful purposes. This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October an other proclamation waa issued, suspending the writ of luibeas corpus, in nine counties in that State. Directions was given that in the nine oounties so designated persona supposed, upon creaiiaoie lutormatlon, to be members of such unlawful combinations, should be arrested by the military foices of the United States, aiid de livered to the Marshal, to be dealt with accord ing to law. In two of the said counties (York ana opartensburg, many arrests have been made. At last account the number of persons thus ar rested was 1G8. Several hundred whose crimin ality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, were released for the present. These have gene- rally made confessions of their guilt. Great caution has been exercised in making test arrests. Notwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person is now in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the judioial tribunals of the United States. As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigorous meusures to enforce tho law, many persons absconded, and there is good grounds for supposing that all of such persous have been violating the law. A full report of whit has been done under this law will bo suhmttted to Congress by tho Attorney General. In Utah there still remains a remnant of bar barism repugnant to civilization, decency and to tho laws of the United States. Territorial officers, however, havo been found who are will ing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity, aud with a due sense of sustaining tho majesty of the law. Neither polygamy, nor any other violation of existing statute, will be permitted withiu the territory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the soli-styled "saints" that we are now dealing, but their practices. They will be protected in the worship of God according to the diotates of their consciences, but they will not bo permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. It may be ad visable for Congress to consider whaf, in the ex ecution of the law of polygamy, is to be the stitus of the plural wives aud their effsprim;. The propriety of Conuress passing an enabling ant. authorizing the Territorial Leifishtture of Utah to legitimttixo all children born prior to u time fixed in tho act might be justified by its humanity to theso innocent children. This is a a suggestion only, aud not a recommendatiou.j The policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably, so far as can bo judged from the limited time during which it bus been iu operation. Through tbe exertions of the various societies of Christians to whom has been intrust ed the executiou of the policy, and tho Board of Commission authorized by the law of April 10, lbo'D, lasny tribes of Indians havo beeu in duced to set. la upon reservations, to cultivate the soil and perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a wuy, it is hoped, as to induce thosa still pur.-uin their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination. I recommend liberal appropriations to oairy out tne InuUu peaco policy, not only beciuso it is humane, Christian-like and economical, but because it is light, ".recommend to your favoral consider -lieu, also, the policy of gr.mtiug a territorial government to the Iudians in the Indian Terri tory west of Ananias and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doiii so every right is grautt d to th" Iudians by the tro ity. I have addressed a communication, of which a 0 py is transmitted herewith, to the Governors of Now York, Peunnylvanii, Uhio, lndiauu, Illinois and Wiscousiu, urging upon the Govern ment of those Statos, respectively, the necessary action ou their purt, to orry into eifect the ob ject of the article or the treaty which contem plates the use of tbe canals on either side, con nected with the uavialiim uf the lakes mid rivers forming the bouudry, iu terms of equity, ty the inhabit inis of both countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object, and tho bene fits to flow therefrom, will secure tho speedy ap proval and legislative sanctiou of tho Stales con cerned. I reuew tho reoommcnda,tion for uu appropria tion for determining the truo position of tho 4'Jtt. parallel of latitude, where it forms tho boundary between the United States aud the British North American possessions between tho L'tiie of tho Woods and tho summit of the K icky mountains. Tho early action of Congress in the recommendation named would put it in the power of tho War Department to pl iei n 1 r-. i in the field during thu next summer. Tho resumption of diplmuotio relations be t eeu 1'r incn in 1 Germany has enabled tne to give directions f(:r tie vitlnJr awal of tho r i -tectum extended to tho Germans in France by the diploid stio and consular rcpresrtiUtivca of the United St i!e in thui country. It is just tt ndd that the d 'iicato duty or this protection h is been p.n'oiiut d I y the llifdsti r and tho Consul t I'm in ainl tin- various Coiiruls in France, mi ner tlitt snpeiviMioti of tho latter, with uivwt kindlier as wi ll us with prud 'to'!. ntnl i u t.

Tho r .tific it.,, ,, ijonuLu Hi,d naturalization connection witn the Austria and Hungary Em pires have been changed. I have been officially informed cf th annexation of th States of tbe Church to the Kingdom of Italy, and the remcv al of the Capital cf that Kingdom to Home, In eouforroity with th rtaMihed policy of tbe United States, I have rroogui'd this change. The ratification of the new treaty cf commerce between the United State and Italy has been txchaDgej, and tke two Towers have agreed ia their treaty that property at sea ball be exempt from rsptnre in cjse of srar between two Powers. The United State have spread so opportunity of incorporating ihi rule iuto the ebligation of nati na. The Forty-fifth Congaess, at its third session, made an appropriation for the organiza tion of mixed commission cf adjudication upon the claims of the ritizeus of tbe United States ai;aiat Spain, growing out of the insurrection in Cuba. That Commission has since been organ ired. I transmit herewith tie correspondense relailuii to IL- ionnation and its jurisdiction. It is', '.x hoped thti this commission will afford tl. ' .aim .tits i complete remedy for their in juri. . It lias K on madi the agreeable duty ot the United States to preside over a conference at aihmuton, between the pleaitpotentisries of Sn..in and the allied South American Republios, which hasiemlted iu an armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace. The intimate and friendly relations which hve so long existed between the United States r.d Russia continues undisturbed. The visit oi the third ton of the Russian Emperor is a proof that there is no dei-ire ou the part of his Govern ment to diminish the cordiality of those rela tions. The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grud Duke is a proof that on our side we share tbe wishes of that Government. The inexcusable course of the Russian Minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask for his recall, and to decline to longer receive that f unctiouary as a diplomatic representative,. It was impossible, witn self-respect, or with a just regard to the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to hold interviews with this Gov ernment after his abuse of Government officials and during his presistent interference, through various means, with the relations between the United States and other Powers. In acaordance with my wishes, our Government has been re lieved from further intercourse with Mr. Cata cazy, and the management of the affairs of the Imperial nation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirely unobjectionable. With Japnn we continue to maintain intimate relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado has, sines the close of the last session of Congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in several departments of the Gov ernmint. I have reason to think that this selec tion is due to an appreciation of the disinterest edness of the policy which the United States have pursued toward Japan, it is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just polioy with China as well as Japan. The corres pondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition on the part of this Government to swerv6 from its established course. Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbirous treatment of our ship-recked sailors at the Corean coast, I instructed our Minister at Pckin to endeavor to conclude a convention with Corea for securing the safety and humane treat ment of such mariners. Admiral Rogers was in structed to accompany him with a sufficient force to protect him in case of need. A small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast, was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was tiven for explanation and apalogy for the insult. Neither came, A force waa then landed. After an arduous march over a rugged and diffioult country, the forts from whioh the outrages Imd beeu committed were galUutly assaulted, and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated the honor of the flg, the expedition returned, finding it impnttible under the cir cumstances to conclude tho desired convention. I respectful' refer to the correspondence relett ing thereto, hero with submitted, and leave the subject for such action is Congress may see fit to take. The uitional debt has been reduced to ths ex tent of $V'J,lo7,12C Sii during the year, and by tho nivtiitiuu of national bouds at a lower rata of interest, tho interest ou the public debt has been so far diminished that now ttiH sum to be raised for interest account is nearly $17,000,000 less than on the first of Mirch, lS(i9. It wus highly desirable that, this rapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen tho credit of tho couutry and to convince it. titizeu of their ability to entire meet every dollar of liabil ity without bankrupting them ; but In view of the accomplishment ot these desirable ends, of tho rapid development of the resources of the country, its increasing ability to meet the laro dem iuds, and tho umount already p-tid, it is not desirable that the present resource of tho couutry should be continue to be taxed in order to con- tiuuo this rapid payment I therefore recorn mend a modification of both the tariff nd inter nal tax laws. I recommend that all taxes from internal nources bs abolished, except those ou spirituous wiuea and unit liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps. In readjusting tho tariff I suggest thai a careful estimate be m h a 3 of the amouut of surplus revenue collected undnr the present law after providing for the current expeuses of the Government, the inter est account, aud u sinking fund, and that thin surplus be reduced in such manuer as to afford the greatest relict to the greatest number, lucre urn many articles not produced at borne, snob as mediciue and compound essences, from which very little revenue is desired, but which enter into gener 1 ue. All such articles I recommend to bs placed o'i the freo list. Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would recommend that it be made up ou those articles which can be. r it without disturbing homo production or reducing tin wiis of American libor. I havo Lot entered into tiurs, because to do ho would be to repeat all that is laid before you in tho re port of tho Secretary of the Treasury. Tho present laws for collecting tbe revouu s pay the Collectors of Customs small salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which at tho principal ports of entry particularly raise the componsition of theso officials to a large sum. It has always seemed to mo as if this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out inducement to dishonest men, should such gt pt)!;(.ssi ?i of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to enablo them finally to in.iko Ihxjkb seizure. Your attention is re spectfully invited to this subject. Continued iluctuitioim in tho value of gold, compared with tho n ition.'l currency, h is a most da:nnt:iriii itl'ecl upon tho increase and de velopment of the toii'.ti y iu keeping up prices of nil artielci nece-siiry in everydi.y life. It fosters u "pirit : hruin.iling prejudicial ulike to u itimial moi'i Is iiH'l tho uutio'ial filiations. If the qo.istiiu can bo met, us to how t" Ket a fixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uniformly iippruachiug par with specie, u very desirable object will bu gained. For the iipelntie.lis of ilia Ullliy in tho plist yi- .r, Micexpeii.su cf m lintainiug it, tho esti mates lor tlie ensuing yer, and for continuing se.i coast and other improvements conducted un der the supirvision ot the War Department, I ret', r you to the hccoiiiJ) myiiig report of tho Sec retary ot War. I o-ill your attention to tho pro viei. na of the act of Congress npprovvd March U, 18(1!), which ili'it oiitiniies promotions in tho staff enrp- of the army until provided for by law. I lecoiumti 1 that c iiuiiil cr of officers incaoh -rudu of the stiili corps t c fixed, nnd that when ever tho i.i. tub r in unv ni.c urane fills below tho number so fixed, that the vacaaer may be filled by promotion from the rs4 below. I sJan leeosnmend that when the office of chief 0f a corps becomes vacant, th place may bo filled by election from the corps in whioh tho vacancy exists. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in the expense of supporting it This ia dno to tho policy which has been adopted, and ia being ex tended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on tho several stations. By these means we have been enabled to occupy at once a -larger extent of cruising gronnd, to visit more .'requently the posts where the presence of oujr flag is desirable, and gener ally to discharo-e more efficiently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace. It has been the aim ef the Administration to enforce honesty and efficiency in all publio af fairs. Every publio servant who has violated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of tho law. If bad men havo secured plaoes, it bas been the fault of the system established by law and custom for making appointments, or the fault of those who recommended for Government positions persons not sufficiently known to them personally, tr who give letters endorsing the character of office seekers, without a proper sense of the grave re spoasibilities whioh such a course devslpes npon them. A Civil Service Reform whioh can cor reot this abuse Is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to ob tain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his friend, and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformation which would enforce this princi ple against all endorsers of persons for public place, would insure great cautiea iu making recommendations. A salutary lesson has been tauttht the careless and the dishonest servants in the great number of prosecutions and convic tions of the last two years. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change whioh is taking place throughout the country in bringing te punishment those who have proved recreant to the trusts confided to them, and in elevating to publio office none but those who possess the con fidence of the honest and virtuous, who, it will always be found, compiise the majority of the community in which they live. In my Message to Cengress, one year ago, I urgently recommen ded a reform in the oivil service of the coun try. In conformity wiih that recommendation, Congress, in the ninth section of an act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government and for other purposes, approved March 3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to ths Executive to icauxrate a civil service re form, and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so. Under authority of said act, I con vened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified for the work, to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labors are not yet completed, but it is believed that they will succeed iu devising apian which can be adopted, to the grest relief of tne Executive, the heads of Departments and m-mbers of Congress, and which will redound to the true interest f the publio service. At all events tbe experiment shall have a fair trial. Under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved February 21, 171, a Territorial Gov ernment was organized in the District of Col lumbis. Its results have thus f r tully realized the sxpectatious of its advocates. Under the di rection of the territorial officers, a system Cf im provements has been inauguratod, by which Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of tbe national capital, the citizens of the district having voluuUiily taxed themselves to Urge amount, for the purpose of contributing to the advaucemeut of the seat of Government. Ire commend liberal appropriation. l(l the part of Congress iu order that the Government may be ir its just share of the expense of Carrying out tho various systems of improvement. By the reat fire in Chicio, tne most impor tant of the Government buildups iu that city were consumed. Theso buri.ed had alrerdy be came inadequate to tbe wnu ef the Gavtrnmeut in that glowing city, aud, looking to the near future, were tnlly iuadeqmto. I recommend, therefore, that an appropriation be made imme diately to purchase tho remainder of the square ou which the burned buildings stood, provided it can be purchnsed at a fair valuation, sad pro vided the Legislature of Illinois will pass a liw authorizing its condemnation for Government purposes, and also an appropriation of r.s much niuney as can properly be expended towards the erection cf n-w buildings this fiscal year. I havn thus hastily summed up the operatioas ot the Government during the List ysar, and made such suggestions as occurs to mo to bo proper for your consideration. I submit them, with a confidence that your combined action will be wise, statesmanlike aud iu the best interest of the whole country. U.S.
