HORTICULTURAL CONVENTION. The Convention of fruit growers which ■: will meet to-day in this city haa very im -7 portant matters to consider. While on ' the one hand the demand for California ' fruit has been increasing rapidly for sev eral years, on the other land there has -been a steady deterioration in the produc ~*tion, because of insect enemies. The in sect pests have multiplied with alarming . -speed, and it must not be denied that their increase has been facilitated by careless ness, selfishness, and obstinate neglect of ■precautions. Ignorant and narrow-minded growers have refused to adopt the suggest ions of the better informed because of the ; trouble involved, in many instances, and yet others have shown themselves so destitute -of community feeling as to be indifferent to the possible destruction of the property •of their neighbors by means of their neglect. The attempt to obviate these drawbacks by legislation has been but par tially successful ; experience proving that the law does not confer upon the executive officers sufficient power to deal with abuses effectively. Tho general result has been the " very serious deterioration of the . -orchards and vineyards, and it has be - come apparent that unless organized action *is taken at once with a view to fight . the various insect plagues, one -of the most profitable and promising industries on the coast will be in danger of speedy decadence. These are among the principal reasons for the holding of the •Convention which meets at Sacramento to day, and it is to be hoped that measures will be concerted on this occasion which may * -check the ravages of the fruit-growers' foes, and thus secure better production for the future. It has been made plain that nothing but unit-ad action is of any use in this connection. One refractory vine cr i ruit*.grower may frustrate the efforts of a whole county or section. / There must be tarmony and patience under discipline, or nothing can be accomplished, and every ■vine aud fruit-grower must realize that his ..* interest and that of all his neighbors are * identical and inseparable. .It is of little use to discover ' remedies * for insect pests unless there is complete accord . as *to * the : character *of the remedial measures, and complete willingness and determination to apply them faithfully and: fully in every •case. We trust that our horticultural ■friends will base their action upon these principles, and that before proceeding to discuss diseases and propose remedies they will agree upon a programme for concerted .action in fighting the insect pests. GERMAN EMIGRATION. • The German Government is casting r -about for means wherewith to put a stop 7 'to the heavy tide of. emigration to Amer -j ica. A Liberal member of the ' Reichstag plainly tells the Government that Germans go to the United States because they find there everything which their own Govern-^ - ment ■• denies them. 7 They - indeed - have abundant excuse for emigration. They get- rid lof militarism, which is rapidly : impoverishing 1 every continental nation, '] \ they find living wages, complete freedom - y from that detestable ■■ police supervision ■which is another of the causes of constant . irritation in Germany, and in general they realize that th?y can " expand . and develop • naturally and healthfully in the new coun - try. : Unless .Bismarck. is able to fetter , the people , by compulsory legislation' they - will continue to come ov<*r to the United States, and i should •> he undertake' to pre - vent them forcibly he is liable to discover •'.' that contentment cannot be made obliga tory, and that a discontented population may be much worse than a dopleted one. . THE OLD TACTICS. We i do ': not . know '_ that Mr. Keifer will . make a worse* Speaker than; Mr. Hiscock. -j So far as 7 personal* fitness is concerned the ■ car.didates are perhaps on a level. But it is interesting to observe that the combina tions which were made to defeat the last named candidate indicate sustained confi dence in political methods which have been for several years becoming more and more distasteful to the majority of the Republi cm. party. , The contest between the sev eral candidates for the Speakership would be of little moment outside their immedi ate political circles but for this consider ation. The country is compelled to lock behind the actual struggle, and to recog nize the reappearance of that kind of poli tics which has been termed "machine," because it does not represent the popular will, but is a means too often of defeating the expression 'of that will.' '. Quarrels be tween Conkling and Blame and Arthur and Cameron, and other politicians, are not specially interesting or important in them selves ; but it is perceived that they stand for much more extensive combinations, which combinations at bottom ■' in volve the vital question whether :~j the Republican party is to exist merely as the fonvenience of a few scheming politicians, or 1,-hether it is to represent the views and Sri ikes', of the millions who cast its votes. Nor is this all. The men who stood round Grant at Chicago last year, and who have clung together ever since, and have been working, openly, or i under concealment, [against the interests represented by the i combinations which defeated him, have in- Produced into American politics an entirely new and decidedly dangerous line of action and thought. The feature of their organi zation which has always been the most con spicuous", is the personal - element in it. Hitherto all parties have made principles and measures their foundation, and men have only acquired importance as they seemed to represent these principles and 'measures.' But the faction which has grown up about Grant has taken an indi vidual for its center and basis, and in doing this it has not only introduced Imperialism to our politics, but has quite naturally adopted Imperialist ways of thinking and speaking. Nothing could be more surprising to the i American thoroughly imbued with the democratic idea than the constant implica tion of the Grant faction that their champion in some mysterious way pos sessed a right to the Presidency. These men had so accustomed themselves to this idea that they strongly resented the entrance of any other candidates to the arena, and Grant himself has evidently never forgiven Blame for what he regards as his presumption in checkmating the Grant "boom.'' * Ever since that time indeed it has been clear that the Grant leaders aid managers have felt very much as the French Bonapariists did when they found that the Republic was too strong for them. And this kind of feeling is insep arable from the undemocratic line of action which " (.irantism " has brought forward, for the moment an individual becomes of more consequence than principles, the democratic idea is lost sight of, and Impe rialism is substituted for it. The country had a sufficient opportunity to observe the tendencies of Grantism during his second administration. It was then that the political Satrapies came into existence; when half a dczen shrewd politicians con ceived the daring idea of governing the whole country through the Republican party, and of controlling the Republican party by the "machine." What the peo ple thought of that project they showed in the autumn elections preceding the Hayes and Tilden Presidential campaign.' The Republican* managers were then in danger of finding themselves deserted by the masses of the party, and but for the nomi nation of Hayes, who was thought to be conservative and safe, there would have been a political revolution. Last year the Grant faction came for ward again with more confidence and au dacity than ever, and at Chicago its lead ers scarcely attempted to conceal their belief that they were about rather to im pose a ruler upon the country than to sub mit « candidate to the suffrages of the people. The overthrow of all their plans, and the nomination of General Garfield, secured the votes of the Republican masses to the Republican ticket. Had Grant been nominated we have never had any doubt that ha would have been beaten. But his friends have never forgiven those who brought about his defeat, and there is too much reason to fear that they have not abandoned the schemes which they then entertained. They have certainly learned nothing by experience. They certainly rely as implicitly as ever upon the power of "machine" politics. And in the Speakership contest the public have a significant indication of their future pur poses. Had General Garfield lived to serve out his term it may be permitted us to hope that this infatuation would have died away. But events have unfortunately appeared .to give encouragement to its dupes just when their prospects seemed darkest, and they have returned to their old devices with renewed energy. There is little ground for expectation that those who have failed to profit by the- plain teaching of political events during the past* five years will listen to reason now. It is far more probable that they will abuse their supposititious opportunities until the Republican masses once more lose patience, and administer a final chastisement to them. *•' The one great lesson to which they are aud have remained blind and deaf is the fact that no *' machine" can control Re publican votes when the final test of opin ion ,- is reached. Shrewd politicians can manipulate delegations, can conspire suc cessfully defeat popular candidates, can often nominate their own favorites ;'* but what they . cannot do is to secure their election after they - have been nominated. And it is also clear that the people cannot be deceived. Even if they themselves were dull-witted, the press would enlighten them.7 But ; they see and appreciate the meaning of : all these "machine" maneu vers, and when the time is fully ripe they will abjudicate the matter. The '.' machine managers may be as subtle and adroit as p^: sible, 7 but 7 they cannot, with all their manipulations, conceal the marks of their hands, and every such mark is accepted by the \ voters as 7 a brand of condemnation.' Therefore the events which the managers are prone to • celebr&ts as triumphs may j very easily be the surest '■- premonitions of i disaster, and therefore they are nearest to '■. I calamity precisely when 7 they think the ; whole g*me is in their hands. . ■■ *-. S ENATOR MILLER'S CHINESE BILL. . .' Senator Miller has drawn a Chinese bill i ; which is intended to prevent any further : | introduction ... of r these 7 people into *, this ! country. 7; Only . these : who were ; here' on : i the li'th July,7 16S1, are to be permitted I to reside here. J; If any of them return to i China \ they ; cannot i re-enter . the ; United ■*■-. States unless ' they ■ have \ previously regis tered * themselves at a Custom-house. No Chinaman of any ' calling or kind shall be permitted to come ) here i without " the con •ent =, of ,i the L Chinese ; Government ; first specially obtained in each case. Officers oi the Chinese Government, students, mer chants and traders are exempted from the general prohibition.*"* Penalties are imposed upon shipmasters infringing the la***". * These are the main features of * the law, which appears to be effective enough provided that the ' exceptions in the first clause -do not afford loopholes of evasion. It seems to be the general teaching of experience that if one begins to classify the Chinese who are allowed to come, one is tolerably certain to end by making room for almost every kind. But it by no . means follows that Congress is now prepared to ; pass a law of this character.* Last time California applied for similar legislation a . Presiden tial election was on hand, and it was thought necessary to throw a tub to the Pacific coast whale. Hence the last treaty Commission and its results. At present, however, there is no Presidential election in l the * way, and therefore the Atlantic coast legislators who believe in ths "broth erhood of man " business, may think the occasion a good one to oppose the new bills and at . the same time air their hu manitarianism. At ail events it will not do to let our expectations get ahead of the event.

Dr. William Gcdding, of the Government Insane Asylum, Dr. James H. Mcßride, of Milwaukee, and Dr. Charming, of Brooklyn, Mass , agreed in the same opinion. Dr. Theodore M.

Seoviile read from Guiteau's book " Truth " until adjournment. The Situation at Washington. Washington, December stb.— lt is stated that Rebeado will object to the swearing in of Chalmers, of Mississippi,' and Dibble, of South Carolina, on the ground that they are not elected. The Democrats say they will resist this, asd a deadlock is possible. Wil letts, of Michigan, will impose the swearing in of Cannon, of Utah. I* is likely the mes sage will not be opened this afternoon. ,;.,'■ **.;- Outlook for Cannon. New Yobk, December sth. — The Herald's Washington special says McPherson, pros pective Clerk of the next House, is given as the authority for the statement that probably the names of the Delegates will not be called until the Houss is organized. It is then probable that when Cannon's name is called he will be objected to by Page of California, Haskell of Kansas, or some other man. This will bring the question as to *** ho is entitled on prima facie evidence fee the seat, Camp bell, who has the Governor's certificate, or Cannon, who has been placed on the rolls by the Clerk. This precedent was established in the Forty-third Congress, when Cannon himself had a ceitificate, and his light to be sworn in was challenged by John R. Max well, his contestant. Cor and Potter of New York, Hoar of Massachusetts, Mj-ycard of Tennessee and others insisted that as Cannon had a certificate of election from the Gov ernor of tho Territory, he must be sworn in, and it was done accordingly. Malionc it ill fur Iti-ldlclicr-Err. Washington, December slh. — Mahone had a conference in his rooms yesterday with a number of Virginia Democrats, to which no Republican was invited. At this conference' it . waa resolved to press Riddleberger for Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate, regardless of what the Virginia Legislature may do in the way of electing him to the Senate. In case of his election he could not take his Beat till ISS3, aud in the meanwhile Mahone in sists on his being elected Serjeant-at-Arms. This has given dissatisfaction to the Virginia Republicans. Young Man Killed In a Frolic. Omaha, December sth. — At Columbus, Neb., on Sunday, several young men were fooling with firearms. One of them, named Dress, put a double-barreled shotgun to his shoulder, and pointing it at a companion named Grant, said : "Now I've got the drop on you." Grant drew a revolver and pointed it at Dress' head, and, whether by ac cident or otherwise, the weapon was dis charged, the ball striking Dress in the left side of the head and coming out on the right side. Dress fell and expired in a few min utes. Grant surrendered at once to the authorities to await the result of the investi gation of the case. The Small-pox Question A (.tnulnc Scare at Chicago. Chicago, December sth. — A dispatch from St. Louis says : F. W. Hatch, said to be Sec retary of tbe California State Board cf Health, writes to the St. Louis Health Com missioner that that State has quarantined against Chicago, and that trains on the Cen tral Pacific Railroad have introduced small pox in five counties along the line in Califor nia, and in every c-.se the disease. can be traced to Chicago arrivals. In St. Louis there is a great deal of small-pox, twenty-six ci : es being reported from quarantine. '■ • . In relation to this dispatch, tho Chicago authorities say they have no official informa tion of the fact, if it be so, and are inclined to doubt it. They say, however, that if San Francis-co quarantines against Chicago, then they will quarantine against New York, out of necessity. The small-pox is indeed very prevalent here, and has broken out in many tirst-class localities of late. Two thousand people were vaccinated at the Health Office to-day, and there were thirty-nine deaths from the horrible disease last week. A smali-pox epidemic is feared, and there is a genuine scare.
