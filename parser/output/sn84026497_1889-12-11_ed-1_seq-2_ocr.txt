THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. 4. C. WINK, Editor Pnopmttopt. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 18S9. J eff JJayis, is dead. He died at 12:45, December 6th, 1889, at Ne Orleans. Everybody knows who Jeff Davis was. Tub President has appointed Judge David J. Brewer, of Kansas, to the vacancy on the IT. S. Supreme Court bench caused by the death of Justice Matthews. The appointment, although a surprise to the country in general, is looked Upon as an exceptionally good one. Tn Philadelphia Item, thus tersely states the case: "Charles W. Stone will be the next Governor of Penn sylvania. The people will boss this job." And that's the way it appears up in this section, where Mr. Stone's great popularity would get him prac tically a unanimous vote. Press Opinions on the Message. President Harrison's first message plain, candid and entirely unpre tentious review of public affairs. Its most striking characteristic is an ab sence of pretense, exaggeration or rhetorical flourish, and there is do at tempt to enlarge upon especial topics for the sake of catching temporary popular applause or partisan advan tage. It has the tone throughout of conscious strength and sincerity, and of profound conviction that the people will unwaveringly sustain the national politics to which they gave approval by their votes one year ago. New York Tribune, Rcj. President Harrison's message is a plain, business document, well written and making recommendations strictly in the line of the Republican platform. New York Herald, Ind. It is a clear, plain statement of the condition of the country in its foreign and domestic relations and of the leg islation that is needed to promote its interests. There is no fustian rhetoric in the document, no epigrams, no straining after effect. Brooklyn Times, Rep. The Well-settled policy of the Re publican party is in the framework of the President's message. It must now be wisely put into acts by the Repub lican Congress. Newark Advertiser, Rep," It is written under a due sense of all the responsibility, and we may also say with the familiarity, of a public servant giving an account of his stew ardship. Boston Transcript, Ind. lhe message as a whole is a clear, lucid statement of the national situa nuu; is conservative ana patriotic in tone, admirablo in its suggestions and recommendations. Boston Traveller, Rep. Whitest does not indicate the pos session of great gifts of statesmanship, or even of very firm individual opin ion, it must be regarded all io all as a creditable production. New York Evening Sun, Ind. The President's message to Congress is admirable in form and comprehen aive in scope, referring in dignified and well chosen phrases to all the topics of domestic and foreign concern that now occupy the publio mind. Baltimore Sun, Dan. The document is written in a digni fied manner and it has an air of can dor and a desire to be dispassionate that will commend it to many readers, and secure for its suggestions the con siderate attention of many who can not agree with them all. Troy Press, Dem. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our regular Correspondent.) Washington, Dec. 6, 1889. The President left here to day for a snort western trip. After visiting Chicago, he will go to Indianapolis and attend to some important private business before returning to Washing' ton. The Senate has, by lot, determined the length of the terms of the six new Senators as follows : Washington Senator Squire expires March 3, 1891, nd Senator Allen March 3, 1893 fiouth Dakota Senator Moody March 3, 1891, and Senator Pettigrew March 3, 1893 j North Dakota Senator Tietce, March, 3, 191, aud Senator Casey March 3, 1893. The terms of the Moutana Senators will not be fixed until they occupy their seats. Judge David J. Brewer, of Kansas, has been nominated by the President to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the lute Jubtice Stauley Matthews, of Ohio. Judge Brewer is a nephew of Justice Stephen J. Field of the Supreme Court ; he has beeu since 184 United Slates Judge fur the eighth circuit of Kansas. He has filled a number of important positions ia Kansas, judicial and otherwise, and has always beeu a popular official The nomination is highly pleasing to Senators Iugalls aud I'lumb, aud iu fact to everybody, with tlio possible exception of several disappointed can didates and their immediate friends. Justice Miller, over whose circuit Judge Brewer has presided for the last five years, says he considers him one of the ablest judges ntw on the bench. When Justice Brewnr takes his seat on the bench with his Uncle Justice Field, it will be the first time in the history of the court that two of the contemporary justices have been so nearly related. Owing to the organization of the Houso on Monday the President's messsge was not read to Congress until Tuesday. The message has been well received by everybody except a bandfull of Southerners who profess to see in its plain statement of the con dition of political affairs in the South cause for alarm. The message is strictly conservative, both in tone and in its recommendations, being thereby io striking contrast to the last dicta torial documents sent from the White House to Congress. Mr. Harrison evidently intended this message to be confined to its strict constitutional limits that of informing Congress of the state of the country. Its recom mendations are in every instance what has been approved by the Republican parly. Upon those things on which j there are different opinions in the par ty he has presented the facts without recommendation. It is a document that has greatly disappointed the Democrats because it furnishes them with no ammunition. Next in importance to the Presi dent's message is Secretary Windom's annual report to Congress, which was made public on Wednesday. Mr. Windom covers the entire financial field and furnishes one ef the most interesting and important reports of the kind ever made. It piesents a plan for the satisfactory solution of the silver problem, which Mr. Windom believes will be accepted by both silver and gold men. Space prevents further notice of the report, but it should be carefully read by every in telligent citizen of the country. It may be obtained by addressing Secre tary Windom. The organization of the House was attended by a little circumstance that shows the danger which will constant ly menace the majority during the sefsioD. After Reed had been elected Speaker, McPherson, Clerk ; Holmes, Sergeaot at-Arms ; Adams, Doorkeep er, and Wheat, Postmaster, Represen tative Henderson, as Chairman of the Republican caucus, nominated Rev, C. B. Rumsdell for Chaplain. Repre sentative Cbeadle of Indiaua, bolting the caucus nomination, moved to strike out the name of Rarasdell and substi tute that of Dr. Milburn, tho blind preacber, who was Chaplain of the last House. Mr. Cheadle was sup ported outright by three Republicans Moore, of New Hampshire; Lebb lack, of New Jersey, and Ewart, of North Carolina and enough refrained from voting to elect Dr. Milburn, who received 106 votes to Mr. Ramadell's 155, the Democrats votiug solidly for Milburn. Ibis is ot itseit a small thing, but if the party caucus can be successfully bolted in small things, mere is nothing to prevent the same thing being doue when something im portant is at stake.
