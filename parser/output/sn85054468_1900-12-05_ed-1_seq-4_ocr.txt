Hay rauncefote Treaty is beaten If the Americans In the Senate stand to gether They alone can betray their cause The llaj Iaunccfote Treats- The great loss which the country has sustained in the death of Senator Cush rnin K Dais of Minnesota will be all thi more keenly felt when the Senate be gins serious consideration of the Hay Pauncefote Treaty It is doubtful it among I he Republican Senators who voted for the proposed Davis amendment to that providing for the defence of the Nic aragua Canal by this Government in case sf necessity there is one left who has the Durage to stand cut against the demand cf the Administration that the original in famy be ratified verbatim at literatim just cs it came from the experts of the British rorcigu Office Mr Hanna insists that the Treaty must and shall be ratified in advance of any canal legislation At the first session of this Congress Senators Lodge Cullom Wolcott and Clark op posed ratification save with the Davis amendment added At the time their po sition and that of their now departed true blue American leader was popularly re garded as unassailable Senator Davis demonstrated clearlythat Great Britain was estopped from complaining of the ad dition proposed since it was in terms tvhat that Goercmcnt had forced into the Suez Canal contention for its own benefit People tvho affect to know what Senator Lodge thinks say that he is true to his conceptions and convictions of a car ago Others believe that his aspirations to the Chairmanship of the Committco on For eign Relations may possibly lead him to Magoun himself Into the idea that he was wrong before and now ought to accept the outward and visible sign of the alliance without further ob jection Should his chairmanship ambi tion be gratified he would be called upon continually In his official capacity to han dle questions of foreign pollcywhich would necessarily be dominated by the lrrctocablc committal of the Admiuistra tiou to a junior partrershlp with Great Britain In all international affairs in con nection with which this country could be used by its ally as a stalking horse a calcpaw or a door mat As for Senator Cuilom and Wolcott there is no particu lar reason for expecting that they will In terpose much obstruction to the British tar of Juggernaut to which Marcus A Hanna has bitched the party elephant The people of this country are now able to understand the mystery of the slrangj and startling anti Americanism contained in the Hay Pauncefote Treaty and in the efforts of Mr McKlnley and those who surround him and act with him to force that openly British measure upon the United State The Treaty and Its promotion by the Administration fcrm only another evidence and illustration of the compact for a practical Anglo American alliance with British para jnountty that the financial combina tion controlling both the Empire 2nd the Republic bate entered into The alliance was sought to be made effective and binding through the medium of the Olucj Pauncofote Arbitration Treaty which failed because there was still pa triotism left In the United Suites Senate to defeat it The Hay Pauncefote Treaty Till do equally as well Should we build the Nicaragua Canal there Hill be an ad dition to our coast line of Incalculable value to the worlds commerce and of enormous danger to this country In the event of war because c shall be prohib ited from defendig it by fortifications on Its line by holding Lake Nicaragua wjth waesr or by military works of any kind in waters adjacentlo the termini of Hie vatcrway Although vc are to bear the expense and construct a canal whese hostile possession In time of war tvould gito an enemy a strategic aitan lagc lu attacking both our coasts we are to Jc rltul out of the ditch which will at all times and In all circumstances be at the command and money of the strongest natal power which of course Is Great Britain Why it may be asked are men like JUnna McKlnley and Hay anxious to place this whip over us in the hand of the British Government The question until recently intolved In some doubt Is now easily answered It is because as we shall always be compelled to keep on good terms with Great Britain and do the bid ding of that power in all things In order to prctent the seizure of our canal on some pretext it will not bo difficult to contince the American people from time to time that they must not refuse any thing desired by our ally since we must alwajs depend upon the good will and grace of that ally for the preservation of our commerce through our Intcroccanlc waterway Tims It will be possible by and by with the ratified Hay Pauncefote Treaty behind him for Mr McKlnley to recommend to Congress a ditislon of our Territory of Alaska with Canada and per haps the cession to that Dominion of an ice clear harbor with some hinterland on our North Atlantic coast In each case it probably could be shown that Brit ish control of the Nicaragua Canal would render it foolhardy for us to resist any friendly demand for aid in war cash or national domain that might be made by the dear old mother country which has been dor fairy godmother as Ambassa dor Choatc says introducing us like a Cinderella to the familj of nations MrKlnlp Econtims In our great prosperilj observes Mr McKlnley at the end of his annual mes sage we must guard against the danger it iutitcs of ctravagance in Gotcrnmcnt expenditures and appropnations In a spirit of childlike trust he contlmLS The chosen representatives of the peo ple will I doubt not furnish en example in their legislation of that wise economy which in a season of nlentt husbands for the future Wnen in future generations Amercans recall the loot session of the Fiftt -sixth Congress and wonder at the corruptions dctelopcd by the campaigns for the Taa ama job the buhsidj grab and cognate schemes we presume that all well regu lated historians will stand ready to as sure posteritj that President McKInleys memory is clear of all scandal in the con nection Posterity will be reminded that at the tery opening of that malodorous session he warned Senators and Members to be good and go slow As this Is not future generations and we of the present day are not posterity it may be allowable to tcnturc the sugges tion that were Congress to take Mr Mc- Kinlcj at his word and avoid cxtrava gance or the Improper appropriation of the public money some of the things he urges for immediate enactment into law would go bj the board1 He wants an en larged permanent Regular Army en a basis which will cost a great many extra millions annually Congress cannot easi ly go slow and be economical and at ihs same time meet his desires on this point He demands the early passage of the Hanna ship subsid grab Of course he will be gratified in that matter But how can Congress tote ninety million dolars out of the Treasury into the already bursting pockets of twelve plutocrat campaign contributors and still heed his warning to treat the privileges cf the till with moderation Mr MtKinlcys Message is silenon the subject of the great log rolling Rlter and Harbor bill which is about to strike the taxpayer for twenty five millions Yet its author knew that such a measure would be introduced and passed and that his controlling pnrty associates had winfcd it so His pious admonition there fore could not refer to that The truth probably is that it had no connection whstcter with anything and was tacked on simply because it would make n smooth mealy and mouthy tell to the Message kite If we are wrong pcr hapssomc of the exalted among the Ad ministration saints with halos will plam what it did does or could mean The worthy President is under no illu sions respecting what his proprietary in tends netcr has been and is and ahvavs was in

but the batters dabts and more or less of his temperament and haracter These to put it mlldlv were unfortunate and resulted in making the late duke persona non grata in the so ciety of his own and

Dec i Ethan Allen Hitchcock Secretary of the Interior came to this city from Washington today on personal business In conversation this etcning he said that there were nearly a million names on the pension rolls now and that the sum needed to pay the Fed eral pensions next jear would be about flJ20CuCC0 In the last fiscal tear the ex penditures on account of pensions were J13SOCO000 Tho increases are due to the more liberal provisions made for teterans widows and the more liberal construction cf the law in regard to disability suffered in the army The time in which the Goternment sur teyors had to allot 3000 homesteads of 160 acres each for the Comanche and Kiowa Indians in the southern part of the Indian Territory expires shcrtiy and on account of tho difficulty the surveyors are having in finding tho old lines less than SCO of the homestead have been laid out Secretary Hitchcock said tonight that nu enabling act would hate to be passed to complete the work The Comanches and Klonras are perfectly willing to leave the lands they now occupy Last year homo Kansas City men discovered that there are valuable mineral deposits in that part of the resertation which 13 now set apart for the Indians and they suggested that the Government purchase some land in Mexico and transport the Indians thith er Secretary Hitchcock sajs that this plan will not go through CANALS AND SHIP SUBSIDIES Got rrnor Irvt OotLeryx View on the Ttvo QiicMtlonn Governor elect Dockery of Missouri called to paj bis respects to the Presi dent tcstcrday Mr Dockery was asked nbout the important measures up fcr ac tion this session and especially about the Nicaragua Canal and Ship Subsdy bills Our people are in favor of a canal across the isthmus built by American capital controlled by the United States and fortified and defended by the Ameri can Army and Naty We are not in favor of any halt way measure which will gltc England any rights bevond those of any other world power This I believe Is the only basis upon which the Ameri can people at large would support tli burden of the construction of tho canal In my opinion it would be little short of criminal for Congress tosaddle the cost of the canal upon the taxpayers of this country and then permit a foreign ra Ion to participate as an equal owner in the international advantages accruing from the completion of the work I have paid very little attention to the Ship Subsidy bill It is a measure for ihs aid of the existing lines However one thing is certain the idea of ship sub sidles ami high protection being adco cated by tho same party is absurd Subsidies to ships contemplate return cargoes and bigh protection Is a bar to Imports Jhus ou can see that the two theories are continually nt war with each cthr This Government attempted sjrsi dlcs in the 4s and abtndoncd it in 185S because we realized that In spite of the subsidies the American merchant ma rine was slowly disappearing If we vcrc branching out as a com mercial vorlds power and had decided to let down the bars against the commerce of other nations there might be seme hope for a great merchant marine England during the civil war pained slpremact as the common carrier for the goods of the world on the seas This was due in a measure to the fact that the i linitcd States was engaged in the civil war but it is also largely du to tiia fact that the British shipbuilders began to build iron and steel ships azd tho ATcri tans dung to the wooden clipper sttle The English more rapidly substituted steam for the uncertain sails All taee tilings

Your people are de llghtful and your country is wonderful said he last night and I shall at all times remember my visit to your country with tnc most kindly feeling Speaking of Jamaica he said The drawbacks on sugar paid by for eign Governments to sugar exporters hurts us considerably as our people cannot compete with the bounty paid sugar as It Is called The Brazilian markets havj also made inroads Into our coffee trade But we will recover We are shipping an immense amount of fruit principally ba nanas to American and other ports We nil make up on fruit what we lose In sug ar antl coffee A new steamship line will be established between English and Jamai ca ports and will be put in operation next month This line trill devote its whole business to fruit carrying Rum Is also exported from our country and wo hava a large demand for this article Our methods of election will probably interest you We have no lower and up per bouse of Congress as you have In this country We elect o number of delegates who represent the people and the Gov ernment appoints an equal number to rep resent the Crown You understand we are a Crown Colony We assemble In the coun cil hall and go through the form of trans acting the Government business This U merely a matter of form The Crown can pass whatever laws It may wish This U because the Crowa has the power to nom inate any number of delegates while the people are restricted to a certain number Therefore if a governmental measure U opposed by the people the Government noclnates more delegates and the measure U carried with a good majority There Is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the people over this means of electllg mem bers and passing laws and we hope the day will soon come when a better election sys tem is given Jo our country Col W H Fields of Chicago is at Chamberlins for a few days after a three months visit to Manila where he went as the agent of a firm of financiers who desired to secure franchises My opinion of the Philippines as a good Democrat said he last night is that they are well worth keeping although I can assure you that we will have to keep a force of 100000 men there for ten years to hold them The Filipino is a dogged person and If he eter get3 sot en anything yoa have to kill him to get his teeth unfas tened The fighting was as severe there when I was in Manila as it was duriag th reign of General Otis who by the way Is not in good flavor with the rank and file The expense of the operations U largely obtained by taxing the peaceful natives and the local customs revenues bring in a tidy sum The troops are not enjyln the best of health and every man I saw seemed to be eagerly awaiting a chance to get home From what I saw in the archipelago it seems to me that but for the ability of ihs United States officers to bribe the hl p ns troops the enemy would give us a t rrl ble time The natives like finery how ever and whole brigades of Insurgents have been disbanded by promse3 of nice uniforms and commissions under the United States Government Thess rene gades are trooped Into native battalions with American officers and are ii scel to rout out and fight their fellows Man It is a fine city and has a big future When wc get electric street cars and medera improvements running all over the place it will be as good to the United States at San Francisco or New Orleans but ns t say
