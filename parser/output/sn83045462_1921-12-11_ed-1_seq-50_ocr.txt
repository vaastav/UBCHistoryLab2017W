Olden Brilliance of Life In Capital Returning as 1922 Season Draws Near Re-establishment of Days at Home Brings Re minder of Times as They Were?Many Debutantes Presented. SALLIE V. H. PICKETT. WASHINGTON is verging on its 1922 season with a brilliant rush which reminds one of the olden life in the capital when days at home were laws and not removable feasts. It was the cabi net days at home, the dinner for governors at the White House Thursday night, innumerable dinner parties endings days of luncheons and teas which brought back the reminder. More than ten thousand women seized upon the first cabinet day receptions to meet the adminis tration circle, and, with cards in hand, rushed from house to house in a state of excitement. THIS week the President and Mrs. Harding will give the first of their series of prescribed official entertainments, which will take the form of a dinner party in honor of the cabinet Thursday night. The dinner they gave in honor of the visiting governors and their wives Thursday of last week was an unusually brilliant event, the details being carried out much as when they entertained for the delegates to the conference. 

NOTWITHSTANDING their routine of official duties last week, the President and Mrs. Harding found time for pleasure and recreation, attending the theater together Tuesday night, and taking with them as guests Representative and Mrs. James R. Mann and the director of the budget and Mrs. Charles G. Dawes, who also dined with them at the White House that evening. Mrs. Harding went to the Capitol to hear the President's message read, and attended a concert, when her guests were Lady Lee and Lady Borden, Mme. Sze and Mme. van Karnebeek, the latter the wife of the Netherlands delegate to the conference. 

DEBUTANTES, who have been a bit overshadowed by the consequence of the conference and social activities for the delegates, quite came into their own last week, beginning with the presentation of Miss Eliza beth Zolnay Tuesday, including the debut parties of Miss Katherine Cheatham. Miss Sidney Webb, Miss Elizabeth Kemp and Miss Mary Pahner, and ending yesterday with the "coming-out" party of Miss Laura Lejeune, daughter of Maj. Gen. and Mrs. John A. Lejeune. This week's roster of buds includes Miss Helen Colbert, Miss Diana Cumming, daugh ter of Surgeon General and Mrs. Cumming; Miss Raguet Stitt, daugh ter of Surgeon General and Mrs. Stitt; Miss Eleanor Carroll Hill, Miss Elizabeth Taylor Jones and Miss Helen Griffin. T^ISS ISABEL CAPPER will have the most formal presentation to * society, meeting diplomats, statesmen and important folk in official life at the evening reception, with dancing, which her uncle and aunt, Senator and Mrs. Arthur Capper, will give for her at Rauscher's Friday night, at 10 o'clock. However, most of the debutantes of the season have been from either the Army or Navy, and still all the "service" buds? as they are termed?have not yet come out formally into the social arena. Several debut teas are on for the weeks before and just following Christmas. TITHILE social entertainment for the delegates to the conference has ?" lessened a little, there is yet much happening and much planned for Lhe future. The foreigners, themselves, have entertained generously and with dignity, and they, too, still have a rather full social calendar for the coming weeks. There was something particularly democratic and home like m the exchange of formalities between the Secretary of the Navy Mr. Denby, and the former Secretary, Mr. Daniels. Of course, Mr* Darnels went to call upon his succcssor in offictf, in due time and form, and Mr. Denby dropped by the apartment of Mrs. Daniels* mother, Mrs. Adelaide W orth Bagley, one fine morning on his way to the Navy De partment, and returned Mr. Daniels' visit.
