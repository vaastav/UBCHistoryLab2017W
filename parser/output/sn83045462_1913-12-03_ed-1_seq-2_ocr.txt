MEXICAN VIEW OF MESSAGE. Shows President Wilson's Bad Faith, v t. Hufirta Again Says. ' ? MEXICO C/.TY, December 3.?An out law of the massage delivered by Presi ? ' ^ent Wilson to Congress at Washington" was prominently displayed by all the Sft&Biste morning newspapers today. The. . paper printed in English.- however/; ' it ata - an jnside page. In;.cort?r menflng on the message, the Indepen-" diente. which is controlled by the gov ernment, says: "The man at the V'hite House has tried ?' to affirm (against tile truth universally conceded) that Provisional President Huerta is losing sympathy every day and that his fall is to be expected. It was hardly believable that President Wilson would have the temerity to assert such a thing. He thereby gives testimony of his bad faith toward things Mexican." The Impartial says: "From a good . source it is known that some of the for eign ministers accredited to Washington i' criticise the message severely. They say " it would be impossible to guarantee the " re-establishment of peace and good gov ? emment in Mexico if Provisional Presi dent Huerta. whose vigorous efforts at the pacification of the country are well known, should leave the presidency." El Pais, the most independent of the Mexican newspapers, says: "President Wilson's words are so in jurious and depressing, and at the same time the charges he.makes against the Mexican president are so unjusft, that it is preferable to pass them by in silence In order not to awaken anti-iAmerican sentiment in Mexico." ? Only vague impressions of the actual ??.contents <zi the messagr* were conveyed by the brief extracts published in the * newspapers. The general conclusion was J! that President Wilson intends to keep his X hands off and leave Provisional President Huerta at the mercy of his enemies. To the administration and its adherents this < ? ourse is satisfactory. They declared to ?> day that since hope of recognttion Is gone, all they desire is to be left alone. The fact that no recognition Is accorded to the rebel* la the message seems to be a great relief to the followers of Huerta. Mexican Events Show Gen. Huerta's Regime Is Failing, Day by Day The flight of Gen. Huerta's generals in northern Mexico, federal evacuation I of the cltie9 of Chihuahua and Guaynias and the refusal of Mexican oil com ; panles to furnish fuel for the move . mcnt of federal troop trains were pointed out by officials here today as among the events to which President \Nilson referred in his message to Con gress yesterday when he declared the Huerta regime was crumbling "by a ; little every day." Regarding discussion of whether the constitutionalists, if successful in their fight against Iluerta. will allow the i nited States to reorganize the Mexican government, men in close touch with the revolutionary movement ?aid that such a course will bs entirely unnecessary. While these men expect the constitutionalist, government, when established, to be en tirely friendly to the United States, they do not believe that the administration here wants to mix in Mexico's internal ailaira after peace is restored. Watching to Continue. Diplomatically t^ere have been no de- i velopments. President Wilson's state- 1 ment that this government would not. in ' his opinion, l>e obliged to alter its policy j of watchful waiting" was regarded as | forecasting a period of passive observa- ! tion. with every eye of the government ! exercising', at the sa?ie time, a close scru tiny on the safeguarding of foreigners and their property. Some diplomatists were inclined to see in President Wilson's expression of hope fulness that when Huerta has been forced from power constitutional order would be restored by the concert and energy ol such of Mexico's leaders as prefer the , liberty of their people to their own ambi i tions," an answer to the frequent iii J quiries in the foreign press as to whether . chaos and anorchy would result if Huerta. retired. Doubt Queen s Action. Diplomatic officials here had no advices to support published reports that yueen Wilhelmina, speaking for The Hague tri bunal, had addressed a peace proposal to Huerta. State Department officials were ?onfident that the United States would be notified before any such proposal was made.

Senator Ransdell Predicts a "Great Bill" Will Pass Present Congress. 2,000 DELEGATES ATTEND THE OPENING SESSION President Wilson, Unable to Be Present, Sends a Message of Encouragement. The tenth annual convention of the National Rivers and flarbors Congress, consisting of 2,000 delegates, which be gan a three-day meeting at the New Wiilard Hotel today, greeted with a great outburst of applause the declara tion made by Senator Joseph E. Rans dell of Louisiana, its president, that he has "every reason to believe that we will have a great rivers and harbors bill at the present session of Congress." ??e*nlj'. alertVto <atch the stentfloance of .overstatement of its leaders and the speakers before it, the convention took it for granted that its resident has re ceived satisfactory assurances that Con gress will pass such a bill, for the pur pose of urging which the rivers and har bors delegates have gathered in Wash ington, and they also applauded a mes ! "f?* froJ.m Pres'dent Wilson, who was scheduled to speak, but who could not ie present, in which he said: President Wilson's Message. "1 congratulate you on what the con gress has already accomplished, not only in awakening the country to the impor tance of the great subjects it handles, but also in bringing us within sight of a time when all interests shail be har monized and we shall be able to agree upon a comprehensive and concerted plan for the benefit of the whole courttrv. Secretary'Lane of the Interior Depart ment, who has recently served as the mouthpiece of the administrat'on at many conventions in Washington, es pecially those in which the question of states' rights has been expected to play a part today, in place of Secretary Bryan, delivered the President's message to the rivers and harbors men and wom en. He prefaced the reading of the let froro the White House with remarks ..^'s own* 'n which he said, in part: I do not know whether you recognize the fact, but to me it is most significant that the people of the United States are now coming together in many conven tions, not to speak in behalf of any proj ect in their individual states, but with a national voice, in behalf of the nation This is a new spirit in our public affairs, i I see in this audien?-c many Senators and representatives who know that it is new, | and they will bear me out when I say , the time is not long past when all we eaw j in Washington in the way of public effort j was the spectacle of men coming here to influence the government for selfish ends. Advocate of Free Harbors. "Now, when I was on the interstate commerce commission a few years ago I arrived at certain conclusions regarding i I the development of the railroads and the waterways of the country. There can be no policy advanced in this country to work against the interests of the rail roads that will result in good to the country generally. The railroads are vital to our life. There is no other nation so i dependent upon them. The people of Cali , fornia help to feed the people of New | York, and the people of New York help .to manufacture for California's needs, j "But. when I was a member of the i interstate commerce commission I said I that the first thing to be done in de i veloping the waterways of this country ] Is to separate the railroads from the sea. to make tho ocean* and the rivers free You will never develop water transporta tion in this country by clearing sand from must have free harbors. These harbors must have rfee harbors. These harbors in ro small part arr within the control of you gentlemen from the different state*, and these states have rights, and these states of yours can play the most lmi>ortant part in developing the water ways by seeing that no railroad interests control the harbors which give access to the oceans. "I believe, with my chief, my chief and years, in making this country one of greater opportunity, in which the natural resources shall not he closed to those of us who are not of a favored few." Control Not Discussed. Secretary' Lan?t discussed the general question of state and federal coptrol only in a general way. This question was ex pected to come up on presentation of the address of Rome Q. Brown of Minneapo lis, Minn., former president of the Bar Association of that state, a recognized legal authority on water power matters. But although Mr. Brown went into the question of state and federal con trol of water-power resources, he was followed immediately by the annual ad dress of Senator Ransdell, the president .of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress, and there was no discussion on the lloor of the convention of Mr. Brown's address. Whether there will be later in the meetings delegates today could not say. Many delegates to the rivers and har bors convention were also delegates and visitors to the .National Conserva tion Congress held here recently, which was nearly broken up by the quarrel over state and federal control of water powers. They listened closely to Mr Brown's address, which went into the history of the legislation andthe dis cussions oflphe subject. Mr. Brown said that the only, way to stop the waste of water power in the United States, which is now generally admitted by all sides to the controversy, is to encourage private capital to Invest. He urged that all corporations engaged in the development of water power be made to take out charters as public service corporations, which would bring them under the coi trol of public utility commissions, or, where interstate com merce is affected, under the control of the interstate commerce commission. No Sharing1 of Profits. Mr. Brown recommended government regulation, but not government profit sharing, ahel "no tolls or fees except such as are necessary to cover the cost of government inspection serv ice," the grantee to provide navigation facilities for the government. The convention pursued the even tenor of its way throughout the first session, harmony being the evident watchword, and its proceedings moved with clockwork regu'arjty. The delegates listened to addresses from his excellency Domicio da Gama, the ambassador of Brazil, and from John D. Hazen of Ottawa, Canada, the minister of marine and fisheries of the Dominion. Mr. Da Gama said, in part: "The end of this congress is to give and acquire knowledge. I cannot give you more knowledge about Brazil than you already possess. But I can Invite you to come to Brazil to see for your selves our rivers and., harbors and see what Brazilians are doing tlwfe. "We have come Bpontanecuiaiy. to ihe lfn{te<} Stale* aad lSmabd here something ofimr experience In'life, be it political, social or industrial. In re turn you should come to haw tile lessons are applied, in another'lknd. Un der different skies, by men of other tra ditions. The trip is w?rth while." What Canada Is Doing. Mr. Hazen said, in part: "For many years Canada has spent mil lions upon millions of dollars for the pur pose of building railways running from west to east and east to west, for the pur pose of giving transportation facilities to the people living on the western prairies and in other parts of the Dominion. "Attention, however, is now being di rected to the necessity of providing ade quate facilities at the harbors throughout the country, and of assisting in the car riage of its products by means of better water communication than is now avail able, and as a result great works for the improvement of Canada's waterways are now in progress, and yet the Dominion is but on the threshold of the development that must take place in this regard. ? "The adequate equipment of the great national ports of Canada has been a matter of especial concern and attention | by the present government since it as sumed office. The great works which are ; now being caried on, on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and on the great lakes, ; for this purpose, is sufficient evidence ! that the government is not only inspired by good methods, but that it has entered" actively upon the project of affording facilities at all our great national ports which will enable them to comjtete on at least even terms with any ports on this continent." One interesting feature of the opening session of the convention was the intro duction, unexpectedly, of Frank Ellison, now of Brazil, of whom Senator Bansdell spoke as being the man principally re sponsible for the formation and organiza tion of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress many years ago. Senator Rans dell said that Mr. Ellison had financed the organization out of his own pocket for many years, and that it could not have come into existence without him. Mr. ElfTson made a brief address to the cheering delegates, telling them some thing of his work in charge of a fleet of river steamboats on the Amazon river. Navigating the Amazon. "Vessels leaving New York and Liver pool," he said, "regularly traverse the Amazon for a distance of 2.0O0 mWes, with twenty feet of water all the way, during the lowest stage of the river. One of our boats has a straight run farther than from New York to Portland Ore., 3,000 miles, and another has one of 2,800 miles." George Clinton of New York was named chairman of the resolutions com mittee, and Edwin Gibbs of Cincinnati chairman of the nominating committee. Other members of these committees, at large. were announced by Senator Bansdell, president of the organization, when it reassembled at 2 o|clock this afternoon for the second session. Following this routine work other ad dresses were delivered, the following being on the program for the afternoon: "The Great l.akes and Connecting Wa terways," by Henry W.

Plead for Money for Levees. A big delegation from the Mississippi valley states, including about 100 citi zens of Memphis, and with former Rep resentative Catchings of Mississippi as a principal spokesman, urged before the rtbuse rivers and harbors eolnmit tee today an appropriation of sufficient size to build permanent levees along the Mississippi river to protect against floods. They favored the Rarisdell Humphreys bill to provide for levees to cost a total of 580,000,000, of which the states would have to lirst raise $^0,000,000, the balance to be appropri ated by Congress. Many epoke in favor of such legislation.

WILLIAM S. Mc.VAHV. REPORTS RIVER WATER IS "HEAVILY POLLUTED" United States Health Officer Advises Against Bathing Beaches on Potomac. t-1 That the location of bathing beaches on the Potomac river and the utilization of raw river water would be an unjus tifiable exposure to infection of persons bathing therein is the conclusion reached by John F. Anderson, director of the hygienic laboratory of the United States public health service, in a report read at the gathering of civic workers in the White House Monday night. Congress has asked the Commissioners for a report on the desirability of estab lishing bathing beaches along the river for white and colored persons. This plan is disapproved by the representatives of 120 local civic organizations who, at the meeting held at the White House, adopted a resolution favoring the locat ing of swimming pools on playgrounds and at other convenient places. In his report on the condition of Po tomac river water near Washington, which was prepared at the request of Edgar S. Martin, supervisor of play grounds, Director Anderson states that tests made indicate a water heavily pol luted. The report, in full, is as follows: Report by Mr. Anderson. "I have your letter of the 26th in which you state that a number of organizations of the District of Columbia are interested in the location of swimming pools throughout the city and that a committee has been appointed to make recommenda tions in regard to the location of these pools. You ask my opinion in regard to whether it would be preferable to locate the swimming pools in various parts of the city and use the Altered Potomac water or whether it would be equally satisfactory to have the pools located near the Potomac river so as to use the untreated water from the river. In reply to thie I would state the following: "Since July we have been examining a large number of samples of the raw Po tomac river water collected between a point in the river known as Three Sisters and Cries boro Point, both of which are above the outlet of the sewage pumping station. These samples frequently con tained the colon bacillus (which is taken as an index of pollution) in amounts as small as one-thousandth of a cubic centi meter and always in amounts as small as one-tenth of a cubic centimeter; and the number of bacteria in the water collected from the above mentioned points was fre quently as high as 95,000 per cubic centi meter. Such findings indicate a water heavily polluted, and in my opinion per sons bathing in such water, unless the water has previously been treated by some method of purification, would un doubtedly be exposed to infection with certain water-borne diseases. Same Conditions at Bock Creek. "We have also made a considerable number of examinations of the water of Rock creek and have found practi cally the same conditions present there as have been detailed for the water in the Potomac river. "From these findings I must neces sarily conclude that the location of bathing pools near the banks of the Potomac with the utilization of the raw river water, or the location of the pools near Rock creek with the utilization of the raw Rock creek water, would be an unjustifiable exposure to Infection of persons bathing therein. "For many reasons it seems to me that the plan that has been suggested of having a number of bathing pools located in different portions of the city is by far the preferable one. In this way the filtered water supply could be used, so that there would be a con tinual stream passing through the pool, and the possibility of infection thus greatly reduced, and the bathing pools would be rendered much more acces sible to many more people than if lo cated in one single locality. "If I can be of any further assistance to you, either by furnishing data or by appearing before your committee and discussing the subject I shall be very glad if you will call upon me." 

JOIN SPUGS TO WAR ON USELESS GIVING Hundreds of Capital Women Heed Pleas of Mrs. August Belmont. MERCENARY CUSTOMS OF CHRISTMAS SCORED Hardships Resulting Are Graphical ly Depicted?True Spirit Desired. An audience of nearly l.OOS. mostly women, but with a fair sprinkling- of men. In the auditorium at Woodward & I-othrop's today heard Mrs. August Belmont tell of the genesis of the Spug movement in New York a year ago. At the close of the meeting practically every one in the audience signed a membership card, handed over a dime, the amount of the annual due*, re ceived a Spug pin and became a full fledged member of the Society for the Prevention of Useless Giving. The gathering, which was under the auspices of the women's division of the Washington branch of the National Civic Federation, was a thoroughly rep resentative one. including scores of women actively engaged In various forms of welfare work in the National Capital. Also the Women's National Rivers and Harbors Congress adjourn ed until 1 o'clock, and the delegates at tended the meeting in a body. Purposes of Movement. The meeting was called to order by Mrs. Archibald Hopkins, chairman of the women's division, who explained briefly the object of the assembly. Miss Maude Wetmore of New York followed Mrs. Hopkins, and gave an outline of the Spug campaign in New York. Miss Gertrude Robinson-Smith, chair man of the Vacation Savings Fund of New York, told how the idea of establish ing a savings fund among working girls, with which to defray the expense of sum mer vacations, originated, and said that through a tremendous falling off in tlu amount of the deposits in this fund short ly before Christmas last year attention was directed to the terrible drain on thf finances of working girls occasioned by the giving of Christmas gifts. Then Mrs. Belmont, real founder of and sponsor for the Spug movement, was in troduced, and talked her way straight tc the hearts of her hearers. Mrs. Belmont prefaced her remarks with a plea thai Washingtonlans might help to make the Spug movement really national by placing upon it the stamp of approval of the Na tional Capital. Hardship for Girls. After telling how the idea happened to be born, only a little more than on* year ago, Mrs. Be mont told of condi tione in many stores in New York where girls earning jfc>t more than 18 a week were forced by circumstances and condi tions in the stores to go in debt as much as $75 at Christmas, even being led to steal jn order to "keep up appearances' and to make a showing as having re ceived at least as many gifts as othei girls in the store. She told of half a dozen instances coming under her ob servation where girls and young womer struggled for months with a burden ol debt incurred in "the senseless, mad ex change of gifts, and the equally Insane unjust and un-ChritUian collective giving "We are banded together." she said "to abolish by popular vote this sense less, silly custom, and to substitute for it a saner, happier, more Christianlik< Christmas. We want to abolish all thii unfair taxation in the name of Christ mas giving, and to put back Into Christ mas some of the old spirit of good-fel lowship and loving kindness and tendei remembrance the season and the daj have lost. Wants True Spirit to Reign. "We attack the insane, the mad. ex change system, and we attack the equal ly pernicious system of collective giving in which each employe of an establish ment or a department feels that he or sh< must pledge a certain sum to go towarc buying a gift for the person in authority that establishment or department. "But we do not attack?the spul movement was not Inaugurated to at tack?giving In the real spirit o Christmas; the giving of gifts no through fear, or to curry favor, or be cause of custom. \V e do not attack the age-long cus torn of giving at Christmas througl love and the pure Joy of giving. A1 we ask is, don't commercialize Christ mas, as too many of us have been -do ing. There are 364 other days in th< year on which we may seek advance ment in whatever way we may choose but don't let's make Christmas. th< only day on which many of us re member the Founder of the religion w< profess, a day of swapping, of sense less exchanging of meaningless gifti in a spirit of rivalry or for the pur pose of advancing our own fortunes." Spug Party in New York. Mrs. Belmont told of the Spug party which is to be held at the Grand Central Palace in New York Christmas day.
