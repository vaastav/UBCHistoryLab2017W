BUTLER. i'A., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12. 1883 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Congress of the United States : At the threshold of your deliberations I congratulate you upon tbe favorable aspect of the domestic and foreign affairs of this Government. OUR RELATIONS. Our relations with other countries continue to be upon a friendly footing. With tbe Argentine Republic, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Hayti, Italy, Santa Domiugo, Sweden and Norway no in cident has occurred which calls for special c mment. The recent opening of telegraphic communication with Central America and Brazil permitted the interchange of messages of friend ship with the Governments of those countries. During the year they have been perfected and proclaimed consular and commercial treaties with Servia and a consular treaty with Iloumania, thus extending our intercourse with the Danubian countries while our East ern relations have been put upon a wider basis by treaties with Corea and Madagascar. Tbe new boundary sur vey treaty with Mexico, a trades mark convention and a supplementary treaty of extradition with Spain and conven tions extending tjie duration .of the Franco-American Claims Commission have also been proclaimed. 

PAUPER IMMIGRATION. The question has arisen touching the deportation to the United States, from the British Islands, by Govern mental or municipal aid, of persons un able there to gain a living and equally a burden on tbe community here. Such of these persons as will come under the pauper class, as defined by law, have been sent back in acoordance with the provisions of our statutes. Her Ma jesty's Government has insisted that precautions have been taken before making shipments. It ha 9, however, iu many cases proven ineffectual and especially so in certain recent instances of needy emigrants reaching our terri tory through Canada that some revis ion of our legislation upon this sub ject may be deemed advisable. SWINE PRODUCTS. The legislation of France against the importation of prepared swine products from the United States has been repeal ed. That result has been due no less to the friendly representations of this Government than to a growing convic tion in France that the restriction is not demanded by any real danger to health. Germany still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from America. I extended to the Imperial government friendly invitation to send experts to the Uuited States to inquire whether the use of these products was dangerous to health. This invitation was declined. I have believed it of such importance, however, that the ex act facts should be ascertained and pro mulgated that I have appointed a com petent commission to make a thorough investigation of the subject. Its mem bers have shown their public spirit by accepting their trust without pledge of compensation; but I trust that Con gress will see in the Natioual and in ternational bearings of the matter a sufficient motive of providing at least for reimbursement of such expenses as they may necessarily incur. THE HELVETIAN CONFEDERATION. The Helvetian Confederation has proposed the inauguration of a class of international treaties fo tbe arbitration of grave questions between nations. This Government has assented to the proposal, and negotiations of such a treaty with Switzerland, under tbe treaty of Berlin, liberty of conscience and civil rights are assured to all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States have no distinctive mentioned relations with that country and are not a party to the treaty, they should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatic repre sentation for the improvement of inter course and the proper protection of the many American citizens who resort to that country a3 missionaries and teach ers. I suggest that I be given authority to establish an agency and a Consulate General at the Bulgarian capital. REVISION OF THE TARIFF OF OTTOMAN EMPIRE. The United States are now partici pating in a revision of the tariff of the Ottoman Empire. They have assented to the application of a license tax to foreigners doing business in Turkey, but have opposed the oppressive storage tax upon petroleum entering the ports of that country. LEGAT.'ONS ro EASTERN COUNTRIES. In pursuance of the policy declared by this Government of extending our interests with Eastern nations lega tions have during the past year been established in Persia, Siam and Corea. It is probable that permanent missions of these countries will ere long be maintained in tbe United Siates. A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither, and treaty relations with Corea were perfected by exchange at Leoul on the 19th of May last of ratifications of the lately concluded con vention, and envoys from the King of Tab Chosun have visited this country and received a cordial welcome. Corea, as yet unacquainted with the methods of Western civilization, now invites the attention of those interested in the advancement of our foreign trade, as it needs the implements and pro ducts which the United States are ready to supply. We seek no monopo ly of its commerce and no advantage over other nations, but as the Chosuns in reaching for a higher civilization have confided in this Republic, we can not regard with indifference any en croachment on their rights. AFRICAN SETTLEMENTS. The rich and populous valley of the Congo is being opened to commerce by a society called the Interna tional African Association, of which the King of the Belgians is President, and a citizen of the United States the chief executive officer. Large tracts of territory have been ceded to the association by the native chiefs, roads have been opened, steam boit9 placed on the river and the neu clu3 of seats estai lished at twenty two stations under one flag, which of fers freedom to commerce and prohibits the slave trade The objects of the so ciety are philanthropic. It does not aim at permanent political control but seeks the ncutralitv of the valley. The United States cannot be indif ferent to this work, nor to the interests of their citiieus involved iu it. It may become advisable for us to co-operate with other commercial powers in pro moting the rights of trade and resi dence in tbe Congo valley free from the interference or political control of any one Nation. 

FOREIGN TRADE HAMPERED. * Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports by restriction as to storage and by tax ation; and the free outward movement of our great food products is in some quarters clogged with like impedi ments. For these mischiefs adequate relief is not always offered by recipro city treaties like that with Hawaii or that negotiated with Mexico and now awaiting the action cf the Senate. NATIONAL FINANCES. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury gives full and interesting ex hibits of the financial condition of the country. It shows that the ordinary revenue from all sources for fiscal year ended June 30, 1883, amounted to $398,287,581.95, whereof of these was received from the customs $214,706,- 396.93; trom internal revenues $144,- 723,368.98; from sales of public lands 7,955,864 42; from tax on circulation and deposits on National bands $9,111,- 008.85; for profit on coinage, bullion deposits and assays $4,460,206.17; from other sources, $17,333,637.60; total, $398,287,581.95. For the same period the ordinary expenditures were: For civil expenses, $22,363,285.76; for foreign intercourse, $2,419,275.24; for claims, $7,362,590.34; for pensions, $66,012,573.61; for the military estab lishments, including river and harbor improvements and arsenals, $48,911,- 382.93; for the naval establishment, including vessels and improvements at navy yards, $15,283439.17; for miscel laneous expenditure, including public buildings, light houses and collecting revenues, $40,098,432.73; for expendi tures on account of District of Colum bia, $6,381,778.48; for interest on the public debt, 59,160,131.25; total, $265,- 408,137 54, leaving a surplus revenue of $132,879,444.41, which with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the Treasury of $1,299,312.55, mak ing $134,178,756.96, wasappliedto tbe redemption of bonds for the sinking fund, $44,850,700;0f fractional currency for the sinking fund, $16,556.96 of funded loan of 1881, and continued at 3£ per cent, $65,380,250 of the loan of July and August, 1881; continued at 3| per cent, $20,594,600 of funded loan of 1907; $1,418,850 of funded loan of 1881: $719,150 of loan of February, 1861; $28,000 of loan of July and Au gust, 1861; $266,600 of loan of March, 1863; $116,850.00 of loan of July, 1882; $47,650.00 of five-twenties of 1862; $10,300.00 of five-twenties of 1864; $7,050.00 of five-twenties of 1865; $9,600.00 of ten-forties of 1864; $133,550.00 of consols of 1865; $40,- 800.00 of consols of 1867; $235,700.00 of consols of 1868; $154,650.00 of con sols; Oregon war debt $545,000; of refunding certificates $109,150.00; of old demand compound interest, and other notes, $13,390; total, $134,178,- 756,96. THE EXCESS OF REVENUE. If the revenue for the fiscal year, which will end on June 30, 1884, be estimated upon the basis of existing laws, the Secretary is of the opinion that for that year the receipts will ex ceed by sixty millions the ordinary ex penditures including the amount de voted to the sinking funds. Hitherto the surplus as rapidly as it has accumu lated has been devoted to the reduction of the National debt. As a result the only bonds now outstanding which are redeemable at the pleasure of the gov ernment are the three per cents., amounting to about $305,000,000, four and one-half per cents, amounting to $250,000,000, and the $737,000,000 four per cents are not payable until 1891 and 1907, respectively. If the surplus shall hereafter be as large as the Treas ury estimates now indicate, the three per cent, bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before any of the four and one-halt per cents, can be called in. The latter, at the same rate of accumu lation, can be paid at maturity and the money requsite for the redemption of the four per cents, will be in the Treas ury many years before those obligations become payable. PAYING THE DEBT TOO FAST. There are cogent reasons, however, why the National indebtedness should not be thus rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is the fact that only by excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable. In a communication to the Congress at its last session I recom mended that all excise taxes be abolish ed except those relating to distilled spirits, and that substantial reductions also be made iu the revenues from cus toms. A statute has since been enact ed by which the annual tax and tariff receipts of the Government have been cut down to the extent of at least fifty or sixty millions of dollars. NO FURTHER REDUCTION. While I have no doubt that still further reduction may be made I do not advise the adoption at this session of any measures for a large diminution of National revenues. The results of the legislation of the last session of Con gress have not as yet become sufficient ly apparent to justify any radical re vision or sweeping modifications of the existing law. DISPOSING OF THE SURPLUS. In tbe interval which must elapse before the effects of the act of March 3, 1883, can be definitely ascertained a portion at least of the surplus revenues may be wisely applied to tbe long neg lected duty of rehabilitating our Nation and providing* coast defenses for the protection of our harbors. THE NATIONAL CURRENVY. This is a matter to which I shall again revert. Immediately associated with the financial subject just discuss ed is the important question. What legislation is needed regarding Nation al currency? The aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit in the Treas ury to support the National bauk cir culation is $350,000,000. Nearly two hundred millions of this amouut consists of three per cents., which, as already stated, are payable at the pleas ure of the Government and are likely to be called in within less than four years unless the surplus revenues shall be diminished. CONTRACTING THE CURRENCY The probable effect of such an ex tensive retirement of the securities which are the basis of the National bank circulation would be such a con tractioa of the volumn of currency as to produce grave commercial embar rassments. How can tbe danger be obviated? The most effectual plan, and one whose adoption at the earliest practicable oportunity I shall heartily approve, has already been indicated. If the revenues of the next four years shall be kept substantially commensur ate with the expenses the volumn of circulation will uot be likely to suffer any material disturbance, but if on the other hand, there shall be great delay iu reducing taxation it will become necessary either to substitute some other form of currency in place of the National bank notes, or make impor tant chauges in the laws by which their circulation is now controlled. THE LEGISLATION NEEDED. In my judgment the latter course is far preferable. I commend to your at tention the very interesting and thoughtful suggestions upon this sub ject which appear in the Secretary's report. The objections which he urges against the acceptance of any other se curites than tbe obligations of the Gov ernment itself as a foundation for Na tional bank circulation, seems to me in superable. THE TWO PLANS. For averting the threatened contrac tion two courses have been suggested, either of which is probably feasible One is the issuance of new bonds, hav ing many years to run bearing a low rate of interest exchangeable upon specified terms of those now outstand ing. The uther course which com mends itself to my own judgment as the better, is the enactment of a law repealing the tax on circulation and permitting the banks to issue notes for an amount equal to ninety per cent, of the market value, instead as of now, the face value of their deposited bonds. I agree with the Secretary in the be lief that the adoption of this plan would afford the necessary relief. THE TRADE DOLLAR. The trade dollar was coined for the purpose of traffic in countries where silver passed at its value, as ascertain ed by its weight and fineness It never had a legal tender quality. Large numbers of these coins entered, how ever, into tbe volume of our currency. By common consent their circulation in domestic trade has now ceased and they have thus become a disturbing element and they should not be longer permitted to embarrass our currency system. I recommend that provision for their reception by the Treasury and the mints as bullion at a small per centage above the current market price of silver for like fineness. INDIAN RELATIONS. From the report of the Secretary of War it will be seen that iu only a single instance has there been any dis turbance of the quiet condition of our Indian tribes—a raid from Mexico to Arizona by a small party of Indians, which was pursued by General Crook into the mountain regions from which it had come. It is confidently hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur and that the Indian tribes which have for so many years disturbed the West will heareafter remain in peace able submission. GUNS AND TORPEDOES. As germain to this subject, I call your attention to the importance of perfecting our submarine torpedo de fenses. The board authorized by the last Congress to report on the method which should be adopted for the manu facture of heavy ordnance adapted to modem warfare has visistcd the princi pal iron and steel works in this country and in Europe. It is hoped that its report will be soon made and that Con gress will thereupon be disposed to provide suitable facilities and plans for the manufacture of such guns as are now temporarily needed POSTAL AFFAIRS. The report of the Postmaster Gen eral contains a gratifying exhibit of the condition and prospects of the interest ing branch of the public service com mitted to his care. It appears that, on June 30, 1883, the whole number of post-offices was 47,836 ; of which 1,632 were established during the previous fiscal year. The number of offices operating under the system of free delivery was 154. At these latter offices the postage on local matter amounted to $419,523,032, a sum exceeding by $105,189,401 the entire co3t of the carriers service of the country. The rate of postage on drop letters passing through these offices is now fixed by iaw at two cents per half ounce or fraction thereof. ONE CENT POSTAGE. In offices where the carrier system has not been established the rate is only half as large. It will be remem bered that in 1863, when free delivery was first established by law, the uni form single rate postage upon local let ters was one cent, and so it remained until 1872, when iu those cities where carrier service was established it was increased in order to defray tbe expense of such service. It seems to me the old rate may now with propriety be restored ; and that too even at the risk of diminishing for a time at least the receipts from postage upon local letters, I can see no reason why the particular class <>f mail matter should Ins held accountable for the en tire cost of not only its own collection and delivery, but the collection and de livery of ail other classes, and 1 am confident after full consideration of the subject that a reduction of the rate would be followed by such a growing accession of business as to occasion but slight and temporary loss to the revenue of the postoffice. GOVERNMENT TELEGRAPHS. The Postmaster General devotes much of his report to the consideration, in its various aspects, of the relations of the Government to the telegraph. As such reflection as I have been able to give to this subject since my last an nual message has not led me to change the view which 1 there expressed in dissenting from the recommendation of the Postmaster General, that the Gov ernment assume some control over the telegraph which it has always exercis ed over the mail, admitting that its authority in the premises is as ample as has ever been claimed for it, it would not in mv judgment be wise to use. If that authority to purchase or assume the control of existing telegraph lines or to construct others with a view of entering into a general competition with private enterprises. THE INDIAN QUESTION. Much interesting and varied infor mation is contained in the report of the Secretary of Interior. I particularly call your attention to his presentation of certain phases of the Indian ques tions, to his reccomendation for the r-j- I peal of the pre-emption and timber cul tivation acts ard for more stringent legislation to prevent frauds under the pension laws. PENSION FRAUDS. The statutes which jtrescribe the definitions and punishment of crimes relating to pensions could doubtless be made more effective by certain amounts and additions which are pointed out in the Secretary's report. ILLITERACY. I [have previously referred to the alarming state of illiteracy in certain portions of the country and again sub mit for the consideration of Congress whether some Federal aid should be extended to public primary education wherever adequate provision therefore has not already beeu made. THE POLYGAMY PROBLEM. The Utah Commission has submit ted to the Secretary of the Interior its second annual report. As a result of its labors in supervising the recent election in that Territory pursuant to the act of March 22, 1882, it that the persons 'oy that act disquali fied, to the number ot about 12,000, were excluded from the polls. This fact, however, affords little cause for congratulation, and I fear that it is far from indicating any real and substan tia! progress toward the extirpation of polygamy. All of the members of the Legislature are Mormons. There is grave reason to believe that they are in sympathy with the practices that this Government is seeking to suppress, and that its efforts in that regard will be more likely to encounter opposition than to receive encouragement and sup port. Eyen if this view should happi ly be erroueous the law under which the Commissioners have beeu acting should be made more effective by the incorporation of some such stringent measures as they recommend as were iucluded in bill Xo. 2238 on the calen dar of the Senate at its last session. I am convinced, however, that polygamy has become so strongly entrenched in the Territory of Utuh that it is profit less to attack it with any but the stout est weapons which constitutional legis lation can fashion. I favor therefore the repeal of the act upon which the existing government depends, the as sumption by the National Legislature of the entire political control of the Territory and the establishment of a commission with such powers and du ties as shall be delegated to it by law. AtSRICCLTURAI. AFFAIRS. The Department of Agriculture is accomplishing much in the direction of the agricultural development of the country and the report of the Commis sioner giving the results of his investi gations and experiments will be found interesting and valuable. At his in stance a convention of those interested in the cattle industry of the country was lately held at Chicago. The pre valence of pleuro pneumonia and other contagious diseases of animals was one of the chief topics of discussion. A committee of the convention will in vite your co-operation in investigating the cause of these diseases and provid ing methods for their prevention and cure. INTER-STATE COMMERCE. Complaints have lately been nnrner otis ami urgeut that certain corporations controlling in whole or in part the facil ties for the inter-State carriage of per sons and merchandise over the great railroads of the country have resorted in their dealings with the public to •livers measures unjust and oppressive in their character. In some instances the State govern ' meats have attacked and suppressed these evils, but in others they have j been unable to afford adequate relief because of the jurisdictional limitations which are imposed upon them by the I Federal Constitution. The question how far the National government may | lawfully interfere in the premises, and i what, if any supervision or control it | ought to exercise, is one which merits i your careful consideration. CHECKING MONOPOLY. I While we cannot fail to recognize the importance of the vast railway systems of the country and their great and ben eficial influences upon the development of our material wealth, we should on the other hand remember no individual and no corporation ought to be invest ed with absolute power orer the inter est of any other citizen or class of citi zens. The right of the railway corpor ations to award a profitable return upon their investments and to reasonable freedom in their regulations must, be re ogn'zed. But it seems only just that so far its constitutional authori ty will permit Congress should |v ct the people at large in their intcr-S-.ito treflic against acts of injustice which State Governments are powerlt to protect THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION At the time when the present Exe j cutive entered his office his death, re moval, resignation or inability to dis charge his duties would ha.e i- f: the Government without a constitutional head. It is possible, of course, that a similar coutigency may again arise un , ,e . ?s lll( ' wisdom of Congress sll pro | vide against its recurrence. The Sen ate at its last session, after full consid eration, passed an act relating to this subject, which will now, 1 trust, com mend itself to the approval of both Houses of Congress. The clause of the Constitution upon which must depend any law regulating the Presidential succession presents also for solution other questions of paramount import ance. These questions relate to the proper interpretation of the phrase ' In ability to discharge the powers and duties of said office.'' Our organic law providing tl at, when the President shall suffer from such inability, tha Presidential office shall devolve upon the \ ice President, who must himself, under like circumstances, give place to' such officer as Congress may by law appoint to act as President. 1 need not here set forth numerous and inter esting inquiries which are suggested by these words of the constitution. They were fully stated in my first com munication to Congress and have since been the subject of frequent delibera tions in that body. It is greatly to bo hoped that these momentous questions will find speedy solution, lest emer gencies may arise when longer delay will be impossible and any determina tion, albeit the wisest, may furnish causes for anxiety and alarm."
