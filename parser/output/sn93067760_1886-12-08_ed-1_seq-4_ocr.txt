<?()VKitNUU UICIIAIIDSON. TUE INSTALLATION Ol' O I'll SJiW KXKCI'TIVK. Tito Inaugural Aildre?? Delivered I hw Oceaalon-A Sirona mu? Timely I'tiper. Governor .John ivtur Richardson was duly inaugurated on Tuesday the ..Oth ult., in tiie Open? House at Columbia. Alter hiking tho oath ol oiliOO, Governor Richardson made ins iuailgural address, as follow s G OU tl omen o? tho Senate and tioUSU of Representatives: lt is with a deep sense of tin- responsibility and obliga tion l assume] that I have josi taken in this solemn presence tho constitutional oath ot oilico tvs Govornor of South Car olina. With no ordinary emotion, and with lt heart full of gratitude to tho people ot this State, through whose partial kind ness i am the recipient of this exalted honor, I this du? enter upon the dis charge ot its high duties, t > the faithful, honest, vigilant and patriotic execution ol which 1 pledge the honor of a devoted son of Carolina. Sincerely distrustful of my own abili ties, 1 confidently rely upon you, their chosen representatives, for such wise, liberal and conservativo action as. aili render the progress of thc Stab' in material prosperity rapid and thc OXCCtl tivc administration of bor affairs easy. To the most unobservant and indiffer ent it inust bo apparent that these arc times fruitful ol vast and pressing problems, social, industrial aud econom ic, both in State and national allah's, w hich demand for t heir si du t ion t he al ?lest talent and most unselfish patriotism. Notwithstanding the dual nature of our institutions and government, investing the citizen, as it does, with vaiied duties aud interests, the peculiar condition ol our State, socially and politically, dining tho dark days of reconstruction, rigidly confined thc attention of our people to tho . uiingly hopeless and Herculean task of wresting from a chaos of cor ruption and venality ill all their hideous forms, and of universal malfeasance in official lifo, such as had never before dis graced tho annals of a civilized commu nity, order and good government. How successfully, how marvelously, thia has been accomplished, leed i at tempt to describe? Surely, it can never bo possible that thc dee]?, soul-burning humiliations, thc crushing tyranny, the ruinous taxation we so long endured, tho bold effrontery of loathsome vice in high places that stalked in open daylight through tho streets of Ibis beautiful capital, have so soon passed out of mind and been forgotten like the idle terror. ot* tl dream, amidst tho quieting, restful surroundings of the renew ed peace, order and good government WO now M> bounti fully enjoy. To the people of Carolina. 1 verily believe, one ol' the greatest mis fortunes that could occur would bc HU oblivious disregard of a former experi ence that, upon the least cessation ot vigilance .-n their part, might, and would almost surely, again become a terrible possibility, i bo same olemouts ol evil aro here, lin- same forces present, though latent: but to this generation, who ure tho witnesses ot and the sufferers from certainly the most anomalous and ex traordinary condition of political and social lifo under which a people ever lived, 1 do not think thero can ever come any deluge of 1.ethean waters so over whelming OS to sink into oblivion the bit ter memories of the past. Sad, indeed, would bo tho sure results of eriminal for getfulness of a lesson so roughly t inghi, so heroically learned! No, this eau never bc. Wo arc again in the ho.iso of our fathers, as masters and rulers, and we are hero to stay ns such for all time; but to stay inspired by the tine instincts of liberty and animated solely by a high and patriotic purpose to dispense even handed justice, to maintain the purity of our institut ions, and to secure to all classes and conditions of our citizens every legal, constitutional and inherent right of man. Witli the inestimable advantages of good and honest government once nunc surrounding us, like a life-giving atmos phcro, how bright the pr' ?speetft ?ra rapid advance in all thc art- ol peace Slid in tho accumulation of tho wealth to which our wonderful resources of soil and climate SO justly entitle us! Trill', Wc are just at this time in a conditiou ol great business depression, common to every interest of tin- whole world, and in no way peculiar to ourselves, save, per haps, m complications arising from thc transition phase through which our agricultural industry is now passing. To this great interest we should certainly give promptly that attention which its importance to thc general welfare so Im peratively demands. Wc should ap proach its consideration with that calm ness of jude*1 mt and freedom from pas sion so css< .bini to reaching wise conclu sions. 'Hie Department ot Agriculture, to whoso charge its interests have been intrusted, and whose development has boon the object of such earnest, faithful and successful efforts, should be sus tained and fostered. All laws upon our statute books tending to the retardation of its development, or calculated to direct its energies into unprofitable channels, should be at once repealed, anti such measure- only as are absolutely needed for its proper encouragement should bc enacted. Perfect freedom of action and judg ment is the most oilicieiti incentive to successful oxertion i.i nil tho occupations of life. This it is the duty of any govern ment to insure to any citizen, whether walking in the pa!hs of commerce, fol lowing tho professions, or gathering tho wealth of nature from our teeming for ests and causing our fruitful Heids to yiold their abundant increase. J speak ns a farmer, who loves his calling with an ardor iuln rited from ancestors devoted solely to thc tillage of the soi., ami whose instincts, allindie and sympathies are, therefore, naturally ami warmly en listed in tho successful furtherance td that hist, grandest and noblest of pur suits. A fair Held, u u tram moled oppor tunities, exact justice, freedom from discriminating legislation, and snell en couragement as is entirely within Il legitimate sphere ol government, is all WO American citizen asks Or needs, and constitute tho very fundamental princi ples of tho liberty for w hich Washington fOUght ami conquered, ami in defense ol which otu*.heroes crimsoned thc count less hills ami valleys of tho Sunny South, May the genius of liberty preside for ever over our destiny and direct all our offorts to tin; neoomplishmonl of so glori ous ft triumph in government?! seit ncc. Amidst tho abundant causes for con gratalation, wo certainly possess ono in tho restored credit ami improved finance? of tho State, brought to renewed lifo, an it were, from a condition of almost nbso lute decay and death. Wo should not forget to scan closely the expenditures of tho government, ana restrict them within the limits of a wise and liberal economy. This is but simplo justice to tho taxpay er, who, however cheerfully ami u neon, plainingly ho may pay his quota of tribute, should not bo subj ec toil to groat or burdous than tho necessities of gov ernment imperatively demand. But it should also bo remembered timi the .smallest and fewest appropriations aro uot always tho wisest economy. Govern* mont is business, and, like any other business, requires for its successful con duct tho USO of money; snell, for in stance, as for the adequate compensation nt officials, the proper maintenance of charitable ami penal institutions, the prompt payment ot all public obliga tion-, tho liberal support of common schools and higher institutions of learn ing, tho necessary expenses of legislation itself, and Hie numerous other incidental purposes that foot up no inconsiderable amount. We have already achieved much in the way of economy, having reduced ex penditures to a point that places tho gov ernment ?d' this otate among thc cheap est, it not tho very cheapest, ul the States ot tho Union. A comparison of our expenditures with those 01 any other State will, I am ?ure, fully justify this assertion. While looking, then, with continued care to tho exercise of this cardinal virtue of economy in tho admin istration of our allans, especial attention should be paid to maintaining tho credit of the State, now at a point ot excellence Hover boforo readied in tho history of her tlnailCCS. If this credit is tully sus laine?! tho opport mity will soon be pro si uted, by the carly maturity of our ?e emitios, ol'rotunding them atti much reduced rate ot interest, and thus re lioviug tho taxpayers, by a Bingle trans action, Ol' an annual burden of perhaps ono hundred and titty thousand dollars. This surely will prove a mensure of econou y that would bo sensibly foll as ii relief to every industry and occupa tion, and should enlist, therefore, for its accomplishment, tho net ive sympathies and co-operation of all. A practical test ol' tho feasibility of this project must soi >n bo made in tho case of our delicieuoy bonds and stocks, which mature as early as .Inly, 1888, for tho refunding of which timely provision, will have, of necessity, to bo made. But however rigid tho ideas enter fained upon this subject, however groat tl.o appal ont necessity for retrenchment and reform, there is one direction in which they cannot be exercised without .stilling tho young life Ot' tho people and sapping thu very sources of our material and intellectual strength. I allude to our publie schools and tho system ol Colleges wo call tho University. The one i-- tho essential complement ol tho oilier, and in itiier can accomplish Ibo full measure of its usefulness without its accessary coadjutor in tho grand work of education, in the Common schools Uro to bo laid tho broad foiiudntious, and iii tho institutions of higher learning aro to be relied the beautiful and lotty structures ol' intellectual development that lender a people prosperous, happy, great and respected among tho nations ... tin-raith.
