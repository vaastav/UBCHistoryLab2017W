Result of Exchange of Views to Be Known Tomorrow. NEXT PRESIDENT SATISFIED, i Understanding' That His Part in ; Preparation of New Schedules Will Be Confined to Suggestions. ? William H. Taft and Speaker Cannon i a.J a conference of an hour and a half at the lloardnian residence, where Mr. Taft is a guest, today. At its conclusion each participant an- j uon need tliat an arrangement had been tunde whereby ,\|r, Taft was to meet the j< republican members of the House eommittee on ways and means tomorrow j afternoon, after which a statement would ; 1< issued. I'ntil this statement is made | Mr. Taft said he and Air. Cannon had I agreed not to discuss what had taken | place between them. The apparent satisfaction with which Mr. Taft explained the situation was j : taken as evidence that matters were very much to his liking. It is known. ? : course, that the subject under dis- , ? 1 ..".sliln ltt t a Pr n Mfkccrc To ft r.nd *>*vuk-4 r. j r i i anu <lil:."ii was the forthcoming revision of the ' ! t:iriff, regarding which Mr. Taft lias de- I ared himself most positively in favor of a thorough rev sion. t Talked on Broad Lines. , It is understood that very little was 1 said between the President-elect and the , Speaker concerning the details of the ' proposed tariff legislation, but that the conversation dealt entirely with the broad principles involved in that legislation. They proceeded upon the express under- j standing that they had come together as j the representatives of two co-ordinate t branches of the government, and what- , ever of difference to detail the future may j develop, if my. today's discussion was on the friendliest possible basis. The understanding, so far as there was nny. was that the President's part in the preparation of a new tariff would be confined to such suggestions as he might desire to make, and was assured that while these would b< listened to by the "House with every possible consideration, he was not led to believe that the House wnnW iihanilnn 1tn mrnrncr-jtir? fh,* nron_ aration of the new law. Nor was there 1 any Indication on Mr. Taft's part that he ^ would expect or desire it to do so. . Both for Revision. (toth agreed that the tariff should be re- , ised and that tlve revision should be 1 along the lines indicated by the tariff ! ink of the republican platform. Neither ' : nik-ated a desire to depart from protect- j .principles in the work to be done. j When urged for a statement concerning t interview Speaker Cannon replied f .at owing to the fact that he had met ! .M T :ft at the latter's request he could m>' nothing. ?

MAY STIRJP HOUSE Member Disposed to Make Startling Revelations. ANGRY AT SECRET SERVICE Claim-> Political Opposition Was Inspired by Washington. INDIGNANT AT THE PRESIDENT Congressmen Resent His Stiictures on Them for Condemning the "Black Cabinet." Thui the secret service branch of the Treasury Department inspire.I the hitter campaign against him in his district, aided his opponents and had a government detective stationed in his district for a month is the astonishing statement made by a prominent member of the House of Representatives to a Star reporter today. This is one of the many and perhaps sensational developments which are expected as u result of the President's fearful roast, in his message of yesterday. of the provision in the sundry civil bill of last year intended to circumscribe the activities of the secret service. or. as it is better known among members of Congress, the "black cabinet" of the I'nited States government. The member of Congress referred tf above as having made the statement hi question was one of those who voted tor t.he provision in question, and who. as iwel! known, has long been opposed to any extension of the duties of secret service men outside the sphere provided for by law?the detection an.l capture ot inunterfeiters and the protection of the President. This member spoke for the adoption of the provision in question when the matter was up last session. During the campaign last fall this secret service matter, much to his surprise, was made an issue in his district, and arguments based on an essumption s.inilar :o that in the President's message of yeserdayTgthat members of Congress wanted lie provision adopted, as they themselves were afraid of being investigated i>> government detectives?were advanced against his re-election to the House, where he has served, in the opinion of his colleagues and the public, faithfully ami long. Revealed to Stenographer. But more than this. He discovered, through one of his stenographers, a young ady, that a secret service operative had seen in his district for a month during the lottest part of the campaign The stenographer became acquainted with the secret tervice man. who, not knowing she was n the employ of the representative in luestioii. confided to her sufficient of his riews concerning the candidate and his )wn purpose in the district during ramjaign time to convince the congressman hat the bitterness of the ca ri um Ivn which boat all records for his section ind resulted in a great reduction of his majority, had been inspired, in part at east, and aided us well, from Washingtor. This member of Congress Is highly inlignant. He has prepared a statement, vhieh, unless he changes his mind by eason of policy at this time, he will read 0 the House of Representatives under 1 question of the highest personal privlege. containing all these facts ami more, ind if ho makes it public, as he now inlined to do, it will create the biggest cind of a stir. Many members of Congress this inornng obtained the printed hearings on the sundry civil bill of last year, with the dea of looking them over and determinng what part of the testimony led PresJlent Roosevelt to make the flat statement that the principal argument used n favor of the provision limiting the acuities of the secret service branch of the Preasury wast hat congressmen were ifraid of being investigated. Indignant at the President. A Star reporter saw many oi' these nembers who had gone carefully over he hearings at which Assistant Chief doran of the secret service was the prin-ipal witness, and each and every one of h*nn said he had absolutely failed to ind anything which, directly or indirecty, could furnish a basis for the President's statement. All "of them, whether >r not they wore directly concerned in he framing or passage of the limiting uovision, professed to be highl* indiglard at the language used by t lie 1't f silent, which, thej asserted, was unfair ind unvvarrsfnted. With respect to the argum< tit.- used for :!i?- passage of tite provision in question, t was recailed today that testimony ben?re the committee xp irgated before he manuscript of the hearing- reached '.he government printing office-show ed. is published in The- Star at the time, hat secret service operatives hail bet it ised to shadow a navy officer, off on leave; to make photographic copies of hotel registers and to do keyhole and :ransom spying, for the purpose of chaining evidence to convict the officer of mproper actions. This evidence w as used for the purpose for which it was secured md the officer w .is forced out of the servC('. Improper Detective Work. It was claimed, moreover, during the progress of the hearings that there were other cases of the satin sort, ami t was admitted l?y the assistant liief if tin- service that iimmi li.nl been loaned Hid transfctred. upon request from lio beads of tlio various government lepartnieut-s. to do \arioiis kinds oi deLee live work, some of a public and mine of a private natur< . The storm raised by t|j<* President's ritieism of lite provision limiting the ietivities ot tie "lilac k cabinet" shows in signs of abating, and unless some ntluential members of Congress deide to eool off ate! take their medicine is the best, if not the fairest, way out .f the difficulty, lien there will he some a at in statements on the Hoop of the House before very long.
