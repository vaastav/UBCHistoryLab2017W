In the grip of the drastic fuel reg ulations issued by the United States Fuel Administration and effective over the entire nation at noon last Monday, Paris this week began ob serving the war-time restrictions on the consumption of the nation's rap idly, dwindling coal supply. The en forcement of this order was the first real intimation of the seriousness of the coal situation that has been felt locally, although it is intimated that further and more sweeping restric tions may be issued before the sit uation is clarified. The new regulations, which went into effect Monday at noon, are as iar-reacning in many respects as those of the war winter of 1917-18, and include the entire nation. In its statement to the public the fuel ad ministration stated that unless the miners return to work in such num bers as to provide a subst&ntil in crease in coal at an early date, "still further restrictions may becofne nec essary, and consideration will have to be given to- the distribution of V?ks of coal now in the possession lustries not considered vital." .wer Used. iew restrictions will be enfor cer war-time powers of the (.Administration.

Each year his tasks seem to become more neumerous and harder, and yet each year the beloved jolly old gen tleman arrives on the hour bearing a new and larger supply of toys and goodies for the kiddies, who have kept tryst with him. There's horrid old H. C. L. who is a strong enemy this year to Sanity. But dauntless and invincible as ever, dear Saint Nick will surely find a way to overcome this foremost foe, so that anxious eyed youngsters can rest assured that the usual brimming stocking will hang by the fireside on Christmas morning I0NLESS, the coal shortage closes Santy's work shop, so that he doesn't have time to paint that little red wagon, or to put any barfr on the big wax doll.

Housewives', Strike Remedy For Paris Women Threaten ' Combine Against Women Cooks To Males Them Be Good. "My cook has quit." "Mary A didn't come today.", "Our cook ov erslept and was late this morning, and I had to get breakfast." Such general and constant remarks have been so frequent for the past several months, that Paris housewives have well nigh grown desperate. Com plaints from all over town that negro women cooks work a few days and then walk off and never show up a gain, or promise to be on hand "Sun day Mawndn' sure" and do not appear or are careless, inefficient, and dirty in the kitchens, and nightly strip the family larder are pretty gener al. It is an accustomed Saturday night performance for Sally Lou to strike for higher wages, and many housewives here are paying from five dollars weekly to a dollar a day or more for a no 'count, trifling colored cook. ; One week, two ladies of the town who sent to respective cabins to hire cooks, were informed that Mayme and Jennie were at the "club." It would seem that the time when negro women in Paris are compelled to work for a living is passing, and that the accompaniment to the, fa nuiliar words, "What's (the use of working po hard, "I got a woman in de white folks' yard. "Shoot a dime." has changed tunes. Perhaps the ne gro men are receiving such high wages that their wives and daughters do not have to work, but with nec essities so high, one doubts this. Howsoever, there is much talk a mong the women of the town of "turning the tables", and forming a combine against cooks. Misteressess instead of cooks in the next several weeks, if conditions keep up, are like ly to strike and it may be just as hard in the future for a cook to get a job, as it is now for some mistres ses to keep a cook. Certain rules for cooks will be established and unless these rules are adhered to, it will be impossible for said law breaker to get a hash sling ing job at a first class home in Parts. The most of the regulations of the proposed combine are not yet made public, but each -cook will be requir ed to give at least a week's notice before she throws up a job, and also employers will be required to give( Considered The Help Problem the same time notice before firing a cook. Also regularity, cleanliness, and honesty, will be considered, and on the other hand each housewife will be required to pay a fair wage. SOME HOG. J. E.

Recommendations for legislation to combat the high cost of living, la bor unrest and radicalism, and a re adjustment of the nation to peace time basis are the outstanding pleas of the president In his message to the sixty-sixth congress which "conven ed in its initial session Monday, and which is expected to continue until thtPfall of next year. This is the first instance since he became presi dent six years ago that Mr. Wilson has net delivered his annual message in person. Due to his illness it was read to the body by clerks, The message covered a variety of subjects1 of vital importance, in fact dealing with the greater national problems in the following sentences. ! The President said in part: j "We must now adjust our econom ic life to a changed condition grow ing out of the fact that American bus iness is full grown and that Ameri ca is the greatest capitalist in the world. "Causes of this (political) unrest, while various and complicated, are superficial rather than deep-seated. Broadly, they arise from or are con nected with failure on the part of our Government to arrive speedily at a just and lasting peace, from transfusion of radical theories pend ing such delay, from heartless prof iteering resulting in the increase of the cost of living. "We should formulate a law de signed to secure competitive selling and preventing unconscionable prof-' it? in the method of marketing to! lower the cost of living. "No one can fail to note the abso lute need of" a definite programme to bring about an improvement in the conditions of labor. -There can be no settled conditions if labor and capital are to be antagonists in stead of partners. The only way to prevent men from agitating against grievances is to remove the grievances "There can be no recession of the.' tide of unrest until constructive In strumentalities are set up to stem the tide.

HOLIDAY SPIRIT UNUSUALLY ALIVE vCurtailed Business Hours And In clement Weather Deters Only Slightly. Although the high winds and rains of last week,' and the sharp cold spell of this have prevented many people from coming to town; in spite of the fact that the early closing orders have hindered others from plans for Christmas buying, nevertheless, the local stores have each day been kept busy by numbers of those, who ea gerly sought the attractive bargains oeing offered. Monday was rather fine and sun shiny, and reports from several mer chants indicate that they were de lighted with the day's business, and of course, if next Monday brings clement weather, the town will over flow with hundreds of Christmas shoppers, many of them added to the usual first Monday crowd. Almost every merchant has enga ged extra clerks to take care of the holiday rush. Most of these have been at the various stores for days, some for weeks, learning the stock and making themselves (thoroughly efficient to wait on the most exacting of customers. The holiday spirit seems to be un usually alive this year. You can almost whiff it in the air. You can certainly discern it in a single circle of the square especially around three o'clock in the afternoon when Lee School has been dismissed and groups of eager eyed little darlings with fa ces pressed close up to show windows are oblivious of you or anything else except the wonders behind the plate glass; or around three thirty when Grove students, in twos and threes pause none less eagerly, to gaze longingly at some desired bit of yew elry or wearing apparel; or if you watch Mr. and Mrs. So and So Casualties Grow In Hog Kingdom As Drive Begins Fat Porkers Pay Supreme Penalty In Great Assault of Weather Man. When the weather man severed di plomatic relations last Monday with the II og Kingdom there was much outward rejoicing on the part of the long-suffering public. Consequently no difficulty was experienced in mar shaling a host of warriors t advance upon the front lines of His Hogship. For many months he has been secure from the fact that his powerful ally old man H. C .L., has exerted all hia powers in the protection of the life and limb of Sir Hog, and as a result Mr. Consumer has been going pork less. Of late there have been long conferences between the latter pow er and the Weather Man, who finally reluctantly agreed to lend his aid in the conflict. During the past week many pork ers have paid the supreme penalty. and the trophies, after being exhibited on the streets of the city, are being sold for approximately 20 cents per pound. It is highly probable that with a continuation of the assistance of the common people's ally that the casualties may become so great that souvenirs in the form of spare ribs,' backbones, chit'lings, etc., may be purchased at an even lower figure. The weather man is a tricky fellow to be in "cahoots" with, however, and may at any time withdraw his forces and go to the aid of the enemy. A atragetic retreat is then the only thing which will save the consumer, so it is best to lay in a supply of sausage and cracklin's while the time is opportune. Mrs. E. F.

Halcyon Period Lie Around Corner With Uncle Sam A Merchant. . - Encouraging sale of lower priced wheat flours and urging purchase of "United States , Grain Corporation Standard Pure Wheat Flour," Julius H. Barnes, United States1 Food Direc tor, in an open letter to housewives of America asks that they cooperate in. adjustment of the present flour situation. Mr. Barnes says that within the next two weeks the Government will place on the market "straight flour in small Dackaees at a nominal coat." This flour, he asserts is being sold, in order to get the "individual consum er and our bakers to readant their consumption to use the product which is m ample supply tms year." Readaption of habits of "our flour consumers is necessary, Mr. Bar nes explains because of the increase in flour and bread consumption and "a shrinkaire in the cron vield of spring sown hard wheats by 150,000,- uuu Dusneis and a corresponding in crease in the yield of winter wheats." He says this makes it nec essary "for a balanced consumption and shilling of part of the demand from one kind to the other." Although flour production has in creased in this country in five months more than 10,000,000 barrels above last year, all of which has been either eaten' or stored away, Mr. Barnes de clares, "our large crop of wheat will care for increased consumDtion." The new standad flour to be placed on the market by he government, Mr. Barnes explains, will be sold at about 75 cents for 1-1 6th barrel, (12 and 1-4 pounds.) The Bureau of Labor retail price reports indicate that for 20 months the average price of flour in this country for the same quantity has been 81 to 89 cents. fully, you can-observe them stop here and there and look scrutmizingly at a choice piece of furniture, or an electric toaster, or the like, and you won't far miss a guess as to what each is thinking of.
