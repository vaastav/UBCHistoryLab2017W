For the reasons fully stated in tny last annual message, I repeat my recommenda tion that congress propose an amendment to that provision of the constitution which prescribed the formalities tor the enact ment ot laws whereby, in respect to bills for the appropriation of public money, the executive may be enabled, while giv ing his approval to particular items, to nterpose his veto as to such others as do not commend themselves to his judgment .CJVlL RIGHTS. The fourteenth amendment to the con stitution confers the rights of citizenship upon all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to tho jurisdic tion thereof. It was the special purpose of this amendment to Insure to members of the colored race the full enjoyment of civil and political rights. Certain statutory provisions intended to secure the enforce ment ot those rights have been recently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Any legislation whereby con gress may lawfully supplement the guaran tee whlcn the constitution affords for the equal enjoyment by all the citizens of the United States of every right, nrivilese and immunity of citizenship, will receive my unhesitating approval.

Ellis has voiced sn in chnation to start the publication of a news paper in this city, though as yet there is nothing positive about it. ITo doubt Mr. Ellis, if he ventures into the newspaper arena here, will seek to supply the demand for a "truly good Republican" journal, which demand has of late manifested itself just a little through the Republican press in othor parts of this district. The Ga zette, as the "truly good Republican" press in other parts of the district said, is not loyal to the grand old party of all iniqui ties, since it wilfully forsook the train of "the powers that be," and the loyal press has expressed surprise that Cairo should be without a Republican paper of the stalwart stripe. Mr. Ellis paper if it materializes will also doubtless seek to meet wants coming from other quarters, which are not to fully met by the existing papers here as is desired. There is room for a paper of this kind here, and Mr. Ellis is perhaps better able to start and. conduct it than most others, as he has already much ot the mate rial needed in such a project, is posted in the mysteries ot its uses and has abundant good sense to make the paper readable and the enterprise successful.
