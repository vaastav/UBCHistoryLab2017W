NATIONAL SOLONS Now Ready to Consider the Work That Is Before Them. TIHE CALLED IN THE CONGRESS. FroiecU for lluvlueas In the Two Cham Wrt-Plenty of Work on Hand - House Can' Proceed with the Appropriation, m boitte 11I1U Are Iteady, aud Will Prob ably Io So Washington, Dec. 7. Congress la once more In Mission and reudy to do busl ines, or will be by the time this dis patch is read by the public. The two houses convened this noon In the time-honored manner, the hour or so previous to the fall of the presiding officers' gavels, showing the floors of the two chambers scattered over with groups of congressmen greeting each other, talking politics, or speculating on what would be said in the presi dent's message about Cuba or the finances, and what, would be done by this session of congress with reference to the tariff, the money question or the pleas of the Cuban rebels for the as sistance of Uncle Sam. Mttle To He loue This Week. Vice President Stevenson, with a rap of the gavel, called the senate to order at noon today. The first day of the ses sion will be devoted almost entirely to receiving the president's message, pro vided It is sent in today, as it is gener ally" conceded that it will be. Immedi ately after the opening prayer a com mittee was appointed to notify the president and the house of representa tives that the senate was organized and ready to receive communications and proceed with business. The first week of the session la not expected o be productive of any important results In a legislative way. There are many senators who think nothing should be done beyond the passage of the appro priation bills at this session, and as these measures necessarily originate in the house there will be a disposition to postpone the season of activity until nome of these bills can be received from the other end of the Capitol. There In Plenty of Work Iteady. The probabilities are that the dally sessions at the beginning will be com paratively brief, and that the senate will content Itself with four days' work each week. The calendar presents a wide range of material for consideration in case the senate shows a disposition to busy Itself. In this is included the Im migration bill, w hich is the unfinished business; the Pacific railroad refunding bill, the statehood bills and the Dingley tariff and bond bills, as well as the Cuban and Hawaiian questions. Sen ators Lodge and Chandler have an nounced their determination to press the Immigration bill to a vote as speedi ly as they can. It will be the first regu lar business to be taken up, and cannot be displcecl except by vote or unani mous consent. They hope to get the bill through before the holidays. Tariff" Will Wait on a Caucus. It Is also possible that the president's message may suggest subjects for speeches, and there are those w ho pre dict that the Cuban question will re ceive vigorous attention from the be ginning of the session. It Is generally agreed that the Republicans will hold a caucus to determine upon a line of policy, especially with reference to the tariff, and until after the exchange of views which this conference will per mit no step is likely to be taken which will commit the party to any position on any question of political significance. 

IIOISK LIKKI.Y TO PI SII ItfSlMOSS. Appoprlatlon Have the Itlght-orWay, and Two of Them Are Iteady. The opening week promises to w.q th? house put its shoulder to the whi-c! of the regular appropriation bills. Chair man Cannon and the committee cn ap propriations w ere at w ork all last week, and it is their eanest intention to pass two and possible three of the bills bo fore the Christmas holdays. The pen sion and legislative appropriation bills are about ready, and work on one or the other of these will be begun In the house before the week closes. The pen sion bill, although It carries a larger amount of money than any of the oth er supply bills. Is very brief, and unless some political discussion is precipitated is not likely to consume much time In its consideration. Beyond these two bills nothing is In sight at present. It Is, of course, not unlikely that the com mittee on rules will provide something for the house to do in case the commit ter on appropriations is not prepared to go ahead with either of these appro priation bills. The course of the legislation, so far as the Important measures on the calen dar Is concerned (like the Pacific rail road funding bill, the Nicaragua canal bill, etc.), will be determined entirely by the rules committee. But it Is safe to assume that nothing will be allowed to block the appropriation bills as they are reported for action. They always have the-right-of-way at the short ses sion. Today will probably be devoted entirely to the reading of the presi dent's message. CHIPPEWA FALLS OUT OF WATER. Work of Cleaning Up and (iettlng Into Itiislneas About Completed.

WINS THE FIGHT. . I lit the Iteferee (Jlvee It to Kharkey on M Alleged Foul. Han Francisco, Dec. 3. No event In the history of pugilism on the Pacific coast ever uttracted public attention here as did the battle between the heavy-welghti Robert Fitzsimmons and Thomas Sharkey last night. Between 15,000 und 0,000 people occupied all the available space in the big Mechanic's pavilion and watched the contest, which was given to Sharkey in the eighth round on an alleged foul. Fltr simmons had the best of the fight all the way through and indignantly de nied making a foul. The referee gave the decision to Sharkey, claiming that while Sharkey was falling from Fitzsimmons' left hook on chin Fitzsimmons struck Shar key in the groin with his knee. The foul, if foul it was? could not be seen from the press stand, but Iteferee Karp gave his decieion in spite of Fitzsslm gave his decision in spite of Fitzsim mons' protests. It was Fitzsimmons fight from start to finish. He fought fairly while the sailor continually used foul tactics. He would clinch and lift Fitzsimmons from his feet, strike in a clinch, though the men had previously agreed not to do so, and he was gen erally unfair. Several times in the mill Fitzsimmons had the sailor going, but could not land a knock-out blow. In the eighth Sharkey started out to do the leading, but seldom landed. Hob con tinually sent m left hand Jabs on Shar key face, sending his head back every time. At first the crowd did not seem to grasp the situation, but when, it dawned upon them that the decision had gone against Fitzsimmons such a howl of indignation as went up has seldom been heard in this section. His ses, curses, groans and hoots split the air. On the platform In the ring Bob Fitzsimmons alid Martin Julian were jumping about and trying to make themselves heard. Although their words were unheard their actions were ex pressive enough. Dismay and disgust were vividly portrayed. Fitzsimmons Indignantly denied that he had fouled Sharkey. He said he had fought falr yl and there was no temptation for him to commit a foul, as he knew he had his m.vn going. Sharkey could not be seen, lie was carried into his room by his seconds and followed by a doctor who examined the Injured sailor. Sharkey recovered consciousness about half an hour later. He was ap parently badly injured, his groin being swollen. He says he had Fitzsimmons going until the eighth round when the foul occurred. Wyatt Karp, the referee, says the foul was deliberate. Fitzsim mons, Just before striking his left hook that apparently knocked Sharkey out, hit the sailor below the belt with his fist. San Francisco, Dec. 4. The city Is divided to the result of the Fitzslm-mons-Sharkey fight, which continues to be the topic of the hour. No one questions that Fitzsimmons had the fight practically w on In the eighth round. Judge Sanderson yesterday granted the injunction asked for against paying the 110,000 to Sharkey. BATTLETn CUBA. New Which Indicates That Maceo Has Won a Victory. Cincinnati, Dec. 4.
