The text book question will undoubt- m edly come up at the next session of the t2 state legislature with renewed energy. of At the session two years ago it was al one of the most interesting questions. rt Whether the apparent interest mani- " fested by our representatives was due to the fact that there were rumors of O0 the ptobable expenditure of a wealth of money by the several monopolies b that desired to secure the contract for n exclusively furnishing the people of the fi state with school books at a rate that b guaranteed them big profits, or whether ti the representatives of the people ex hibited this concern simply because I they knew everybody in the state re garded it as one of the rarasmount qnestious of the day The Mail it u lable to state. To be charitable, however, r we will accept the latter as being the f case. Already this year the agents of the big book houses are getting things in shape for the battle for supremacy. It is known that in Montana we are paying more for school1 1inks than we shounl. vastly mn, re than is the case in other stat(e-, and tlih olbject should be I to get as ccl l1-,ks as p~taicc at the lowI.t po-'sible rates. Last session the c hlcators of the tate attenpNted to dt'e termine which i ,k were the best and t thev sadly dii-ur e.d when it came to making a s'ectI, ti.

In many of the states of the union this has been done. and. we underst;rnd, that in California they print their own school books as well as perform all other printing that is necessary for use by all state oftticers. Of course, it is a nuwstion whether M..ntana is populous , hough to make such an undertaking pay. and if not. The Mail would be averse to the expenditure of public funlds for the establishlllelt of a <in'cure. even if it would be for a printer. Miss Maggie ioughtiln is spoken of as a candidate for a deputyship under Clerk and Recorder Daniel Arms. 'Miss Magagie writes anl excellent hand, and if she should receive an app. intinent we believe she would !ill it with credit to herself and the ccuuty as well. 

REGARDING BUTTE WAGES. re A writer, signing himself "Sub. th scriber," in the Butte Mining World, w takes up the wage question of Butte B and attempts to show how it would be m possible to operate the silver mines be there in a cheaper manner insofar as co wages of miners are concerned without at affecting those of the copper miner. be He says that this may be accomplished la "by the contract system, such as is ai now in vogue in the Homestake mines it in the Black Hills in Dakota. There hi the miners get from 80 to 90 cents per em ton for ore broken on the sill floor and it delivered on the cage, and from 45 to at 60 cents for ore broken in the stopes. 0' The company furnishes timbers framed lo at the station-the miners place them c' - nd pay for all powder, candles, fuse, e: and any unusual breakage on drill 8' machines. In fact, without this sys- a tsm, the great Homestake properties could not operate. Again, their mills 0 are practically automatic, and in this a respect great improvement could be P made in our Butte mills. " h Further on, in advancing his prop- t osition, he remarks: e "If the miner and mill owner could J be induced to work hand in hand, E many properties now idle could be ran n full force, and no more complaint need 2 be heard of scarcity of work or hard P times. Who will make the proposition? d For every mine owner there is a hundred miners, each more deeply in terested than the capitalist. Therefore, it should be the Miners' Union who should take up the matter and so ar range it that it would in no way con flict with their interests, and at the same time would looseu the chains that now lock many idle stamps in MIon tana, and the cage of every idle silver I mine in the west." ; The Mail cannot see how the pla t Sui2gested could be male to work. In Bntty l.ost of the mines carry copper I as well a. silver. and it would be a delicate matter t, idetturine whichi Smine- would be allowedl t> work under the c.mtract system and. which ones would be compelled it pay the $d. 7 per da.y wage.

The only question t to -t will ever come up in any definite t -inrm will be whether or not the miners e: : state will consent to a general -r reduction of wages, and the prospect - f this move is, in our opinion, buried in the dim. distant future.

FRANK J. WILSON, Wilson Block, Lower Broadway. i.. NNN"" " NNNý"ýNNýýýNýNýýNNN"""NNýNj referred to in the Mining World struck the keynote to the present problem pr when he stated, in discussing the Black Hills proposition, that "their j mills are practically automatic." We wa believe that there are many ways in All connection with the operation of mines an and mills where improvements could we be added wherein a large amount of 1 labor could be saved by the addition of all automatic contrivances as well as more Co improved methods of reduction. We g$ hardly think that the question of We economy in this line is studied by min- 21 ing men as it should be. Then there are leakages of various kinds around Gr our mines and mills that could be J. looked into w ith profit, such as the ex- $11 cessive con.aumption of fuel, and other d expenditures that are not nearly so es- a sential as the payment of miners' ml wages. to This wage question will be worked foi out in time by the natural condition of affairs, and we cannot see that news- Ri paper talk of t:e kind referred to will m have any tendency to help matters in W the least. The miners know just m, exactly how things stand, and The in Mail inclines to the belief that if the i Butte mine owners have any talk to C make they had netter do it with the Miners' Union rather than with the Pt public, as the miners are the ones most K directly affected. m th A 

WALL STREET ECHO. of to President Cleveland's message to of Congress was read last Monday. It m has caused a great deal of comment, to principally of an uncomplimentary f character, except in Great Britain, ol where it was received, generally, quite hi favorably. If there is a man on earth who can throw together a greater number of wor.!l and mean and say less n' than Grover Clc veland, he has not yet cropped out in ::aerican politics. His ti reference to t!e Cuban question is I highly disapp:"'tiung to Americans: in fact. his idea is to actually do noth inc toward alleviating the distress on the "Gem of the Antilles." He ad vises the government to hold on until so:methiuc of more importance turns f up to warrant interference, not con sid,.ring the attempted extermination c ,f a people ,women and children in- h clndeo , as a sufficient cause for inter- 1 ftrence on the Dart of the greatest lib-:rty-loving nation on earth. That f p.part which deals with the financial qp,,estion is but a reiteration of past f - nessages of the President, and recom mends the withdrawal of greenbacks i Sanud the increase of national bank cir 1 cn:ation. In fact. the whole nlmesage is but an echo from Wall street and 3 there is no one important topic that re g ceives any merited recognition or e ree )mmendation, except, possibly, that if part which deals with the trusts and ' monopolies. The whole document can best be summed up in the words ut , tered by Senator Tillman. who. upon y being interviewed regarding it, said: "s "It is commonplace. The best thing I about it is, that it is the last we will 11 have from that source-at least the last in annual message." ig -Bracket lamps and reflectors at T. s| Long & Co. * ,t -Men's and boys' winter caps from 25c. to $1.73.
