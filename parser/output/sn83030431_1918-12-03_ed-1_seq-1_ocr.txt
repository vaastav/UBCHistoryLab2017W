Whether the choice falls upon Car ter Glns, chairman of the ilouse Committee on Banking and Currency and author of the Federal Reserve law, or upon Bernard M. Baruch, re tiring chairman of tho War Indus tries Board. -Is not definitely known. That It will be ouo or the other of them seems certain, though It is pos sible that an outsider Is to he named. Tho President and the. retiring Sec retary went over the nation's financial programme as well aa the future of rnllroad operation at the conference. It la probable that the choice of a suc cessor to Mr. McAdoo as Director General of Railroads was discussed, although "no noinounoeraeatp ithta, connection is anticipated for several weeks.

These expenses compare with the $24,500,000,000 appropriations for the current year, ending next June 30, with the $18,000,000,000 which prob ably will be nctnally spent this year, uud with the ordinary annual ex penses of nbout a million dollars be fore the war. he advance estimates are neces sarily rough, nnd many departments expect to cut them down during the next few months as cornmlttees of Congress work over tho figures In drafting appropriation bills.

Tho War Department wants $2,556, 000,000 next year for bringing thfe army home from Europe, maintaining part of tho force, continuing fortifications and other purposes, and the Navy De- partment estimates Its needs at I tiBfi.OOO.OOO, even more than this year. The Shipping Board asks $500,000, 000 to build ships already authorized by Congress. $00,000,000 for operation of vessels, $17,451,000 for recruiting and training officers and crews and 11,453.000 for incidental administra tion expenses. The Item of $830,000,000 as Interest on public debt Includes provision for meeting the semi-annual payments on Liberty bonds already outstanding and those to be issued in the near future, nnd this sum is not subject to any great alteration. There, Is small provision for post offices and other public buildings and for river and harbor Improvements. Only $1,567,000 is Included In the esti mates for buildings and practically all of this is for continuing construction already under way. Similarly about ha.lf of tho $19,870,000 for rivers and harbors Is for maintenance or con- tlnuatlon of existing projects $5,000,- 000 is asked as a general fund for use by the Secretary of War and $4,000,000 for Hood control on tho Mississippi Itlver. For Congress, it Is estimated that tho expenses will be $17,955,000; for tho President nnd a few bureaus re volving about him, $5,981,000; for tho State Department. $12,725,000; for tho Treasury and nil fiscal purposes, $1, 427,515,000; Panama Canal, $12,216,000; Interior Department and a number of public works projects, . $270,283,000; Department or Agriculture, $5,283,000; Department of Commerce, $39,388,000; Department of Labor, $20,712,000; De partment of Justice. $1I,18S,000; Fed eral courts, $1,110,000; for foreign Intercourse, including consular actlvl- ties. 511.042,000; for Indian affairs, X1.M0.O00. and for pensions arising I torlly In previous years.

President Wilson's pronouncement In regard to the desirability of early legislation dcnllng with the future permnnent relations which shall subsist between the Government and the railways was warmly approved by Senntora and Itepresentntlves who arc mem bers of the committees on Interstate Commerce. The legislators seized at once the suggestion of the President th!t "it would be a disservice nlike to the country and the owners of the railroads to return to the old con ditions unmodified." The response to the President's ap peal for definite action on the rnllroad sltuntton disclosed there was practi cally unanimous support for legisla tion which would create n permanent relationship between the Government nnd the lines bused in general terms on the methods employed during the administration effected by Director General MAdoo.

Ia Congress to-day President Wilson Ocntlcmcn of the Conorcst: The year that has elapsed since I last stood bofore you to fulfil my constitutional duty to give tho Con gress from tlmo to time informa tion on the state of the Union has been so crowded with great events, great processes and great results that I cannot hope to give you nn adequate picture of Its transactions or of tho far reaching changes which have been wrought in tho life of our nation and of the world. You have yourselves -witnessed these things, as I havo. It Is too soon to assess them; and we who stand in the midst of them and am part of them nro less qualified than men of an other generation will be to say what they mean or even what they have been. But some great outstanding facts are unmistakable and consti tute in a sense part of the public business with whl(5h It Is our duty to deal. To state them is to set the stage for the legislative .and execu tive action which must grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine. The Orrrira Trtnmpb. A year ago wo had sent 145.198 men overseas. Since then we have sent 1,950,513, an average of 162, 542 each month, the number in fact rising In May last to 245,951, in June to 278,760, in July to 307.182 and continuing to reach similar fig ures in August and September in August 289,570 and In September 257,438. No such movement of troops ever took place before across 3,000 miles of sea, followed by ade-. quute equipment and supplies, and carried safely through extraordinary dangers of a4. tack dangers which were alike strange and Infinitely difficult to guard against. In all this movement only 758 men were lost by enemy attacks 630 of whom were upon a single English trans port, which was sunk near the Ork ney Islands. I need not tell you what lay back of this great movement oMnen and material. It is not invidious to sav hut h.l, e it in,. , .

Pershing and Sims, down to the youngest Lieutenant; and their men were worthy of them such men as hardly need to b commanded, and so to their terrible ndventure blithely nnd with the quirk Intelligence of those who know Just what It l they would accom plish. I am proud to be the fellow countryman of men of such stuff and valor. Those of us who stayed at 1 homo did our duty; the war could j not have been won or the gallant men j who fought It given their opportu nity to win It otherwise; but for , many a long day wo fIuII think our selves "accurs'd we were not there, and hold thii- manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought." with these at St. Mlhlel or Thierry. The mem ory of those days of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate men to their graves; and each will have his favorite memory. "Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember with advantages what feats ho did that day I" What we all thank God for with deepest gratitude Is that our men went In force into the lino of battlo Just at tho critical moment when tho whole fate of the world seemed to hang In the balance and threw their fresh strength Into tho ranks of free dom In time to turn tho whole tide and sweep of the fateful struggle turn It once for all, so that thence- icrui ii won uuui, uuK, uuck lor j their enemies; always bnck. never I again forward!

I have said that those of us who stayed at home to do the wqiJ: of organization nnd supply will al ways wish that wo had been with the men whom wo sustained by out labor; but we can never be ashamed. It has been an inspiring thing to bo here In the midst of fine men who had turned aside from every private interest of their own and dovoted the whole of their trained capacity to tho tasks that supplied the sinews of the whole great undertaking! The patriotism, the unselfishness, the thoroughgoing devotion and distin guished capacity that marked their toilsome labors day after day, month nfter month, have them fit mates and comrades of the men In the trenches nnd on the sea. And not the men i here In Washington only. They havo but directed the vast achievement. Throughout Innumerable factories, upon Innumerable farms.
