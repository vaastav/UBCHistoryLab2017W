Few messages have ever been read be fore congress, the sentiments of which have had the sustainment of the coun try to the extent to which tbe message of President McKinley enjoys that ad vantage. Coming immediately after the most decisive popular verdict of approval bestowed on the policy of the administra tion of its author, there will be few found to lake exception to its utterances. It is an extended and business-like review of the public business of the nation, and its recitals are naturally so made as to show the administration off to the best advantage. Yet, taking those of its state ments which find dispute nowhere, and those alone, it must be admitted that the showing is one with reference to the materia] interest of this nation of which C-. ry American," without regard to party, has much reason to be proud. The policy of the administration in China has thus far been-, attended by signal success. The review of the events leading to the appearance of the Ameni can soldier on Chinese soil, while cover ing great detail, is essentially correct in all "its statements and is not open to serious dispute in its conclusions. There -are two features of the presidential refer ence to China and its affairs which will receive the heartiest approval of all patriotic citizens. These are the sug gestions put forward, first, that the probable financial inability of China to meet in actual money the indemnity de mands of the powers may be made good through the increased guaranties for for eign rights and immunities and by the to opening of the empire to the commerce cf the world on terms of equality among the nations; and, secondly, that the recommendation of the Russian govern ment in favor of referring disputed ques tions regarding indemnity; etc., to The Hague arbitration body for adjustment be adopted by the powers. Acting along the lines thus indicated, there is brought into view an early and an entirely hu mane and equitable adjustment of the most difficult problems now attracting the attention of the world, and the fail ure to settle which may lead to the most serious consequences on the territorial Integrity of China. Despite the extended space accorded in the message to the subject of the admin istration of the affairs of the Philippine islands, there is, perhaps, no other por- tion of the message which will be re ceived by tbe country with less of as surance. The question has been settled that we are to continue in control and ownership of the former possessions of Spain forfeited as the result of the late .war. The great issue which will prob ably divide public sentiment in the fu ture will be the wisdom or unwisdom of the methods resorted to in the govern ■sonent or those possessions. In that re gard the United States have before them en opportunity to demonstrate to the world in the most impressive manner the inherent superiority of repress, tive institutions, and they are, too, con fronted by the danger of bringing indel ible disgrace upon free institutions, as well is on the good name of this people. "We have had one experience already of What the spirit of spoils can accomplish for us away from home. The custom house and postal scandals at Havana have never been made known in their seal significance and extent, and they probably never would have been made "known at all had it. not been for the courageous initiative of Gen. Wood. .Tlio£e who believe that all the preten tious machinery made mention of in the •president's message, of peace commis sions, civil service regulations and the like, will save us in the immediate fu ture from even still more gigantic scan dals arising out cf the division of the spoils of the Orient among the hench men of Mr. Hanna and Mr. Piatt and "Mr. Quay, and the other recognized na tional leaders of the Republican party have far more confidence in the rectitude of the class of men whose activity in pol itics is dependent on the gain they can acquire either through office or official pcrquisities than the average non-office •Seeking citizen enjoys. This, indeed, its the most ominous subject of concern with Which the administration will be called sc: to deal during the coming four years. Oi all this long official presentment of President McKinley what may be re garded as the most important portion Is embodied in its closing details. The recommendations of the message regard ing the foreign shipping of the United States may be accepted,- together with those relating to trusts, and the review made of the fiscal afflairs of the govern ment, as embodying considerations of future policy of the most momentous hearing on the welfare of the people. It would certainly have been more satisfac tory to public opinion had the president fereatsd the matter of trusts in a mere lamp]* and less reserved form than that ■re-oited to by him. His administration may bo said, withstanding the great •popular Indorsement just bestow d en it, to be reasonably suspected of a wish to promote the policies in industrial and economic life which tend to the perpetua tion of the control of the trusts.-.-No sari-: ous effort has ever been put forward! by that administration to put a curb on those combinations which have suc ceeded, as the people well realize, In virtually monopolizing _ the markets^ of the country in almost all the necessaries of life. It is not an unreasonable belief that the administration of President Mc- Kinley has"a serious day of reckoning with, the American people on this subject, unless the incoming congress- follows a policy which will lead them far outside the narrow path marked out "for legisla tive and administrative action in this be half in the present message. The recommendations in favor of a lessening of the war taxes to an extent of $30,000,000 will receive the . heartiest ap proval of the country, Which anxiously looks forward to the day when all those taxes will have disappeared, and'- the recommendation of economy in expendi ture with which the president closes his message is put in practical operation. The vast surplus which the treasury*fig ures is of course a matter of much grati fication to the country; but its expendi ture in directions which will promote the' great object of a, fuller and cheaper system of commercial- -distribution is a requirement which, .while it receives no consideration whatever in the mes sage, attracts the intelligent expectations of the country. If the policy recom mended by the president is followed un erringly by congress, of promoting the foreign commerce of the country by gov ernment aid extended to. Shipowners en gaged in foreign trade, the record which will be presented" in the. coming four years of gain to the • industries of the people will constitute one of the strongest claims which the administration can put forward to a continuance in power. No mere expression of . partisanship will suffice to cover up the "many excel lencies of the last message of President McKinley. It shows its author to be a man of sterling patriotism,- and no one will be disposed to quarrel with the claims which he puts forward as to the increased security and extension of free institutions, as the result of the increas ing prosperity of the American people. THE 

ANDERSON TAX DECISION. The decision of the United States su preme court declaring unconstitutional the so-called Anderson law will not sur prise any one who Is familiar with the nature of the enactments of this gen eral character which have been forced on the people of Minnesota at intervals during the past fifteen or twenty years. Confiscation is the one word which fully expresses the purposes and tendencies of their authors. The grain rate bills of old and the meat inspection bill are two of the many measures ' of this kind which have found Incubation beneath the wing of the Populist and demagogic .contingents of all' parties that have-ap peared in the several legislatures of the state during that period. They have ail had their day, and they have all gone the way the Anderson tax scheme has gone. It would be gratifying if there were any assurance that the sense of this whole matter had been, or would be by the present situation, forced in upon the consciousness of those* who have de voted their energies in the past, or.are likely to devote them in the future, to the crippling of the greatest industry of the state—its railroad carrying system. But there is no reasonable hope of such a result. It is to be expected, however, that this decision will operate, at least for years to come, to prevent those whose intelligence should teach them better from giving even their implied sanction. to such raids. In every well ordered state in the Union the principle is of universal ac ceptance of a gross earning tax upon the common carriers, in. lieu of all other forms of taxation. It is a blessing to this state, to its revenues and its indus tries, that this decision has been handed down, and that, as a consequence, the principle of the gross earning law is pre served to the people. Under its opera tion the railroads have enjoyed a reason able measure of prosperity, while the state treasury has gained materially. Substantial justice has been done be tween those corporations and the pro ducers cf the state, and the loss and trouble attendant upon other systems of tax collection have been saved to us. Repudiation is not always attempted through the immediate fiscal operations of the community.— It was repudiation which lay at. the basis of this enactment —the repudiation of the contract obliga tions of the state. Thanks again to the intervention of the highest court in the country, the mischievous and ignorant assault upon the state's credit, as well as on its best interests, involved in this undertaking, has been overcome, and we will enjoy, for some -time to come at least, an exemption from a "repetition cf a haimful demagogism. 

"FEDERAL COURTS AND THE TRUSTS. At common law all monopolies in re straint of trade were illegal. They were illegal because the effect ..of their opera tion was believed to be against the best interests of the community. The power to deal with and to - curb such enter prises _was inherent ...in the* sovereign power. In the United States that power lies either with the state or the federal government. Article 1. section, 8, of the constitution provides - that 'Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the sev eral states and with the Indian tribes.' The tenth amendment "to the consti tution provides that "the.powers not del egated to the United States nor prohib ited to the several states are reserved to the states or to the people." In the case of the rregulation of trusts other monopolies, the power of the federal government is restricted to those which affect commerce between the states, or with foreign nations. The dif ficulty® experienced in the few attempts that" have been made.to regulate trusts has not arisen from a lack of power in THE ST. PAUL GLOBE, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1900. the government, but rom • the interpreta tion of the term interstate, commerce. The first federal legislation designed to ; control r monopolistic tendencies - among large-corporations T was the interstate commerce act,. designed to prevent pool ing among competing lines of railroads. This act was passed in 1 the 'SOs, and has had a wholesome' effect on the disposi tion to consolidate railroad interests for the purpose of eliminating competition in freight; rates. The growth of gigantic combinations, with a purpose single to the control of production and the advance of prices, led to the passage of- the Sherman anti-trust act, which became a law in 1830. The title states the purpose of the law: "An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopo lies." " Section 1 declares every contract, ■ combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the states to be illegal, makes the act a mis demeanor, punishable with fine or im prisonment,, or both. Section 2 makes it a misdemeanor to monopolize or attempt to monopolize such trade or commerce. . Section 3 declares contracts for such purposes illegal and subjects the parties thereto to a fine or to imprison ment. Section 4 gives the federal courts jurisdiction and imposes upon the dis trict attorneys under the direction of the attorney general the duty of enforcing the law. ' The first case arising Tinder the anti trust law to reach the supreme court was, "United States vs. E. E. Knight" company," the famous sugar trust case. The. American Sugar Refining company, of New Jersey, had contracted for the purchase of the plants of four inde pendent sugar refineries in Philadelphia. It was to declare these contracts void that the suit was brought. The facts revealed by the trial were as follows: The American Sugar Refining company controlled '35 per cent of the sugar output of the United States. The four refineries of Philadelphia produced 33 per cent of the output, leaving only 2 per cent to maintain the competition of trade. The object of the purchase or the consolida tion was clearly to monopolize the sugar output, that not only the prices-might be raised, but that the production might be controlled. The evidence showed that the material for the refineries was gath ered from various states, and the product not only found market in the various states of the Union, but in foreign lands also. Here as a case which clearly came under the terms and spirit of the anti-trust act. But a majority of tho court, however, held that the contract of purchase related only to the transfer of the plants and only remotely to the sub ject of interstate commerce, and conse quently was not within the meaning of the law. This view was so narrow that it not only was against the spirit, but also the letter of the act. Justice Harlan, in.his dissenting opinion, took the com mon sense ground that interstate com merce consists not only in the transpor tation of an article from one state to another, but it also includes the manu facture and sale of the same, together with all business transactions necessary in the present . commercial conditions. This statement seems almost axiomatic. Yet a majority of the supreme court could not see it that way. In the case of United States vs. Hop kins, the court even went a step further to give the anti-trust law a knock-out blow. The Cattle Dealers* Association of Kansas City sought to monopolize the cattle market and control prices by pre venting any member of the association from either buying from or selling to any one outside of the association. Although the object of this combination was ap parent, and the result a monopoly of a trade coming from all points of the com pass, the court held that the association was local and* not within the purview of the anti-trust law. The action of the supreme court in the sugar .case had the effect of discouraging trust litigation and gave a plausible pre text for non-action on the part of the attorney general' and other district at torneys whose sympathies were- known to be with the trust interests. There, were, however, a few cases tried where the law proved ample, even when appealed to the supreme court. A case in point was United States vs. The Addy ston Pipe and-Steel.company. This case was-tried "in Tennessee, Judge Taft writ ing the opinion. Here was a combina tion which divided up the territory Into "spheres of influence" where the mem bers of the combine did not compete for trade except to put in straw bids always higher than the one in control, in order to keep up the semblance of competition. Certain sections of territory were left open to all, but the contracts were sub mitted to a committee and let to the member of the combine which offered the highest. bonus to be divided among the members. As the operations of this unholy combination covered several states, the court was compelled to affirm the decision of the lower court, so far as the operations extended into neigh boring states. Another similar case, but which was never appealed, was United States vs. The Coal Dealers' Association of San Fran cisco. Here was a combine to control the price and distribution of coal in sev eral states and British Columbia. The object of the association was .hown in its by-laws. • The court found that its existence wa3 in direct violation of the anti-trust law. .. - - ' Such has bfen the action of the federal courts on a most important public ques tion. Unfortunately, a majority of '.he court saw fit to give the act the most narrow construction of which it was capa ble. This strict construction of the law was mere than a century behind the times, : but what it takes away from '.the federal jurisdiction it gives to that of the states. „ There is ample power either within the state or the federal govern ments to deal with trusts in all their varied forms. '■-'-, - For all combinations, which are not local in their effect, the present anti trust ; law is all sufficient. The "crying need new is, first, not fcr more federal law, but for uniform state laws to deal with trusts ■ that seek \ to : hide behind the skirts of the state. jurisdiction; arid, sec ond, for an attorney general and for dis trict attorneys who are able and willing to do their duty under the "law as it is now, or as it may be amended during this term of congress. The constitutional amendment discussion has served "its political purpose' and can be laid on the shelf for another - four years. THE 

EXAMUVATIOS SYSTEM. A person standing, where, the street cars stop near the 'corner of the Univer sity grounds. during the last week would have heard such remarks as the folio ing from the" students: "Now, I can throw dull care-, to the winds. I am through." Another, who is ; not "through," repeats a familiar" college parody, "Of all sad tales of tongue or pen, the saddest is this, I've flunked again." Or perhaps still . another, with a brighter expression on his face,- quotes these historic words of * Thomas Paine, "The times that try men's souls are over." It is examination week at the. univer sity. This is the time that the .editor of the college paper indulges in his periodi cal vaporings upon. the evils of the mark ing system and examinations, and some of the city dailies of Minneapolis take up the refrain by. which this relic of bar barism is to be consigned-- to oblivion. They tell us the examination system is not beneficial to either ■ the care'ess bright student, the hard-working but dull, student, or the all-round good stu dent. Not to the careless bright student, because it causes him to do superficial work. But is not a record of super:!cial work better than that of no work at all, which would be his were it not for exam inations? Not to the dull but hard working student because it sometimes causes him to flunk .out of the univer sity. But no conscientious professor will fail to make himself acquainted, as far as possible, with the habits as well as the abilities of his students; such a pro fessor will invariably give the honest student the benefit of a doubt. If he flunks he flunks on his own merits. In other words, he ' has taken a step to wards finding his place in the world. Is it not better that he should do tnis thus early in his' career than to spend four years of time, earnings and energy in fitting himself for some calling for which the harsh .but unerring judgment of the world .will sooner or later con vince him he has no aptitude? Not to the all-round good student, because it burdens him i with unnecessary work. But may not even he derive some bene fits from those "finishing touches" which his pride ; will demand that he shall give to his work at this time? Whether the examination system i s beneficial or harmful is best decided by knowing the purpose which it is intended to serve. This purpose is not primarily to find out what the student does or doe not know. The examination has for Its ultimate object the maintenance of a high general standing for. the universlty-the creation there of an esprit de corps of intellectual life, which with present fa cilities cannot be secured by any other means than" by insisting upon a certain grade of ; written work by each individual student.' ; And.such a standard is abso lutely necessary for any institution which would hold its place as an educa tional.factor. The time may come when state univer sities will have become so richly endow ed that the classes of each teacher may be restricted to a dozen, or, at the most twenty students, instead of the crowded rooms to which he now has to lecture Then he may be able to give such* time and attention to the individual student that the necessity for some rigid test to make him acquainted with the capabili ties of each may be avoided. Until that time comes the written examination will continue to serve a useful and necessary purpose. . - A recent dispatch to a St. Paul paper said, "Hitherto the administration has wielded the most powerful influence in determining the course of legislation, and there is no doubt that the Republican majority will again respond to President McKinley's recommendations." The fel low who got that up and sent it over the wires to * the unsuspecting Republican press, is a humorist of no mean order. The United States stands second as a colony holding nation. And yet we have no scheme of government by which those colonies can be governed. The salt trust has arrived at San Fran cisco. For a salted concern the acts of this trust are decidedly fresh.
