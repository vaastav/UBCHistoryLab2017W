Our market opened %c under yesterday and for over an hour there was barely anything done. The market keeping within a range of ^c. There was a toltal absence of influencing conditions .,at first, other than heavy receipts in the northwest. Later on the market became stronger on fair buying. When we consider the fact that Canada has taken one-third of its late crop for feeding purposes and that there is a growing use of wheat with use in the same direction, why should it not sell much higher than at present. Near noon some activity developed and price on May worked up to 70%@.%c. Market held steady for a short time and on selling by scalpers prices re­ ceded Vic. There has been some good support (to the market since midday and it should work higher. Corn was weak in the early trading, selling %c under yesterday's close, but on some good buying it soon regained the loss and advanced %c. The buy­ ing has been for good people and corn should take another spurt soon and with a greater head of steam on than it has yet had. Oats were lower, too, but became steady and firmer early. Provisions opened at yesterday's closing figures and advanced 12%c on .buying by packers and held firm all day. FINANCIAL SUMMARY. New York, Dec. 17.—The stock mar­ ket was more cheerful today than in some time- A C. P. opened weak and sold down to 60% but good buying de­ veloped in this stock and turned it up to 64%c. The buying looked better than at any time since the decline started. Money rates were somewhat easiej. The next two weeks will see the end of tight money on account of preparations for January-dividend dis­ bursements. After January 1st there •will be plenty of money and stocks should advance sharply. It would seem to be good policy to pick up a line of stocks on the dips between now land January 1st. SAW DEATH NEAR. "tt often made my heart ache," writes L. C.

Today is moving day at the Northern Pacific headquarters in the city. Agenit S-cotit and the depot force aire busy transferring their properties and persons from the old to the new build­ ing. The ticket office was moved to the new building this morning, the waiting rooms opened, and tickets can now be purchased in the new building. The first ticket sold over the new win­ dow was disposed of to an Italian ped­ dler who dropped in just in time to ob­ tain that honor. The baggage and express departments will be removed tomorrow, Everything about the building is spick and span and the opening will be greatly appreciated by the traveling public. The old buildings that have been been used temporarily, are being hoisted off their foundations prepara­ tory Ito removal from the grounds. The old depot building has had a varied career. It was originally an ice house attachment to the Sheridan house. Thereafter it was used as a gambling saloon, Restaurant, ice cream parlor, and after the fire three years ago it served as a postoffice building for several months, winding up its caree of usefulness as a depot build­ ing. LAND TAX CLEARED UP AUDITOR MOORHOUSE BELIEVES THAT SIXTY DAYS FROM NOW WILL SEE ALL TAXES ON LANDS IN COUNTY CLERED UP. Auditor Moorhouse stated today that he believed the next sixty days would see all the delinquent taxes on lands in this county cleared up. After the recent tax sale and the issuance of deeds for property sold for taxes three years ago, there will remain no taxes on lands unsettled. A large number of the parcels of land, sold for taxes three years ago, and on which final notices of redemption were issued re­ cently, have been redeemed, both by owners and local real estate men. Quit claim deeds have been obtained from the fee owners in many cases, and with these real estate .men have paid the taxes and redeemed the land. Probably not over sixty tax deeds will issue to the original purchaser of these lands, out of several hundred notices issued. Auditor Moorhouse also calls atten­ tion to the fact that under the law, a large number of city lots are now the absolute property of the county and can be sold at public or private sale as the county commissioners may direct. These are lots thalt were bid­ den in by the county in 1898 for the taxes of 1897 and the Uaw provides that after three years they become the absolute property of the county and shall be taken off the tax list The list of these lots includes a num­ ber of good residence properties in the city. The owners have until they are sold by the county to redeem them. If this is not done, the county may issue an absolute deed under the direc­ tion of the commissioners.

Some time since it appears that Ma/cnab, the papular druggist of the city across the Red, famous for his hair tonic, re­ ceived.a carboy of muriatic acid. For some reason it proved unsatisfactory and he ordered it returned. It was taken to the N. P. freight depot and left upon a barrel for a time. The name, Macnab, appeared on the bottle and this proved a hoo-doo for Flo­ berg.

Boers Said to Be Tiring of Life in the Field. New York, Dec. 17-—The correspond­ ent of The Time? at Pretoria says the recen1. British successes occur oppor tuinelj at a moment when the Boers are Showing signs of discontent with the life on commando, but the British instead of congratulating themselves, ought to put forth further efforts on a bigger scale. Another dispatch from the same cor­ respondent says that of the 800 Boers collected north of Bethel under Gener­ al Piet Vilijcen, only two commandos of a hundred men each remain in the neighborhood. The rest, including Vil joen, have gone to the northeast, to­ ward the DeTagoa ra'lway line. "There seems," says the correspond­ ent, "no reas.cn to doubt that Acting President Schalk-Burger and the 'Boer government officials,' have crossed the line north. After addressing a large meeting near Carolina, at which he told the burghers that they must be steadfast, as foreign intervention was certain before long, Schalk-Burger seems to have decided that the coun­ try north of the Delagoa railway line was more attractive than the high veldt, where the British columns are huntling the Boers incessently. He probably is new in the neighborhood of Pilgrim's Rest, where some 400 Boers have settled for the summer. "Viljoen is the leading spirit in East­ ern Transvaal. After General Botha had been busy encouraging the Boers with tales of the withdrawal of British troops and of Boer successes in Cape Colony, his (Viljoen's) defeat by Gen­ eral Bruce-Hamilton should materially increase the discontent which is very rife among the Boers in these districts. tlie naval ciourt of inquiry rendered the best' knowTi men in the Gaj.hq?:r its verdict Rear Admiral Schley has church ofvthe West, died Sunday ni^ht iy would be a work of such magnitude thj&t the adwriral has addressed the fol- dhim of the Associated Press my grat- canned through the gasoline engine ex- sis Krugers Grandson Sails for Africa.
