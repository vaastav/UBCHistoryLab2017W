General Hitchcock's fine administra-1 tion of the postofflce department is highly praised, especially the re-! duction in the annual deficit, and the important recommendation is made that postmastfers of the first, second and third classes, as well as of the fourth class, be put in the classified service. This would require the pas sage of an act changing the method of 'theil' appointment, so as to take away the necessity for the advice and consent of the senate. The President is satisfied this would result in reliev ing congressmen of trouble and in se curing from postmasters greater at tention to business, greater fidelity, and consequently greater economy and efficiency in the postoffices. The document throughout is an able one and merits cordial endorsement. No one who would inform himself concerning national affairs should miss reading it.

Our business men should learn from these examples that they can git low er rates of insurance and safety for their business by reducing their haz ards.

Everyone: Just stop and think during these few very busy days that everyone is as busy and perhaps more tired than you are, and a little kindly thoughtfulness on the part of each one will make a happier Christmas. There may not be much open recognition of courteous consider ation for the feelings of your fellow man, but you will have just a little satisfaction on Christmas morning if you can remember one solitary thing you have done to bring a smile instead of a tear to the face of one lone mortal. There are plenty of tears even the happiest season of the year, so let's all go out to bring a smile. Don't ever stop thinking of yourself and your troubles and cares, it might stop wearying or boring someone. There is only one way to be of real service to those about you and that is by forgetting self in the effort to lighten the burden of- another. Start now getting ready for the spirit you would find yourself in on Christmas morning. It may take some of us every day In the preparation, but. let's be ready. If you start in tomorrow j-jorning by saying that you are glad you are alive and glad that you are living with just whom you are and working for just whom you do, you will at least make them all happier for so talking even if you are not very sure of yourself. Bury your grouch and your regrets deep down and out of sight for a few weeks, take a new lease by taking a new grip. There is no power outside like that inside yourself to make you do it. Get busy now and Christmas will be happier for you and all who know and meet you.

Leader-Press: Al though the progressive Republicans have thirty-eight members of the next Iowa legislature, against thirty eight conservatives, dispatches from Des Moines say there is considerable doubt of the election of an out-and-out Cummins adherent to fill out the unex-1 pired term of Dolliver. The same de velopment is apparent in Iowa which! occurred in this state after the stal warts had been decisively defeated— the dominant faction is beginning to show divisions in its own ranks. Among the Iowa progressives there are many who are beginning to resent the domination of Cummins, includ ing some who criticise his partial sur render on the tariff question during the recent, campaign and others who feel that his machine is tryiijg to de stroy all independence of thought in his element of the party. Already there is talk that, if Senator Lafe Young, who has been appointed by Governor Carroll, cannot be elected, the standpatters will combine with the independent progressives and elect a senator who will be a progressive, but who will not be controlled by Sen ator Cummins. Lieutenant Governor George W. Clarke is the man favored in that contingency. It is said that Clarke controls fifteen votes, which, with the conservatives, would be a majority of the caucus. The possible combination is dangerous to Senator Cummins, because Clarke comes from a county adjoining Cummins' and should he be chosen the anti-Cummins element would be furnished an argu ment when his term expired in the expediency of choosing senators from different sections of the state. What ever the outcome the session at Des MoineB this winter promises to be unusually interesting and exciting. WATERWAYS CONVENTION, President Delano of Wabash Rail road Will be One of the Most Prominent Speakers, In addition to the addresses of President William Howard Taft and Governor Judson Harmon of Ohio, at the coming convention of the Nation al Rivers and Harbors congress, which will be held in Washington this week, the utterances of Fred eric Adrian Delano, president of the Wabash Railroad company, and John N. Patten of Chattanooga, Tenn., will be followed with much interest by the friends of Improved waterways throughout the country. It has been several years since the president of a great railroad sys tem like the Wabash appeared before this congress of waterway enthusi asts, James J. Hill of the Great Nortn ern_ having given his endorsement to the movement for a comprehensive policy of waterway development on the part of the federal government years ago. Later, Mr. Hill was follow ed by President Brown of the New York Central, who took an advanced position on this great question which is uppermost in the minds of the American people. Story of Career. President Delano began his railroid service with an engineering party ia Colorado in 1885, later entering the machine shops of the C., B. & Q. rail road at Aurora, 111., as an apprentice machinist. Two ,yearB later Mr. De lano became superintendent of the Chicago terminals of the Burlington and shortly afterward the general manager of the system. After leaving the service of the Burlington, Mr. Delano was consulting engineer the war department in relation to the railroads in the Philippine Islands. He has been president of the Wabash company since 1905. While Mr. Delano is looked upon as one of the great engineers of the country and a railroad man whose di versified training peculiarly fits him for his present position, John N. Pat ten of Chattanooga, is as well known to the south as MT. Delano is to the west. Mr. Patten has been one of the guiding spirits of "Dixie,'- having by shrewd intelligence comprehended the advantages of the section in which he lives Mr. Patten's name has been synony mous with every public enterprise not only in Chattanooga but. in the southern states. He has been one of the pioneers in the grand movement for a national progressive movement in waterway improvement. He not only knows the wonderful Tennessee river and appreciates its immense possibilities as an auxiliary to com merce but he has a correlative grasp of the' importance of the subject to the whole country not excelled by anv man in public or private life. What he will have to say about the Teu nessee river will not only be noted with deep interest by all concerned that great waterway, bat will prove instructive and inspiring to all wiio A zJ/ /•••*•'.
