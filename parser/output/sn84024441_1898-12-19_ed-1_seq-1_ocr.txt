FATHER BROAVN DIES FROM PNEUMONIA EIM IBB TOOR S0WI1 Mil ffl THE MASSACHUSETTS DRY HOCKED WAS AN ADYOCATH QE RITUALISM: Senator Piatt of Connecticut Replies to Mr. Vest. MAY ACQUIRE NEW DOMAIN Xoiliing in the Constitution to Pre-! vent Expansion. An Interesting- Presentation of Facts in Regard to Uic Power to Hold Colonies. After the routine morning business in the Senate today. Senator Piatt of Con necticut, in accordance with a notice glv ien by him last week, took the floor to re ply to -Senator Vest's speech on the lat ter's resolution declaring: that under the Constitution of the United States no pow er is given to acquire territory to be held and, governed permanently as colonies, j Campbell, he said the Journal was inror The Senator bud piled on his desk a for- j rect, as Campbell told him he had looked midable stack of legal looking volumes j Into the matter, and no longer considered and it was evident that he had prepared himself to meet and annihilate the argu ments advanced last week by Senator Vest. Senater Piatt made a strong, clear argu ment, asserting the inherent sovere'gn right of the United States as a. nation to acquire territory or in any other way ex ercise absolute jurisdiction within its own domain. Ho referred frequently to the re ports and other documents before him, reading excerpts in support of his argument-He was listened to with great attention hi- Senators on both side of the chamber. Senator Vest left his own seat for one near the speaker, and paid close attention t Senator Piatt's lemarks. Senator Piatt said at the outset that he did not propose to talk on so-called ex- iniisten. which wa the natural growth , of the nation, but to reply to the rcsolu- i tlon of the Senator from Missouri. He j maintained that the rights of the natim j to acquire colonies were inherent. 'Whon we come to believe that the United States is a nation," he siid, "rnwiy of the doubts wh'ch now beset us will Wsappear." He cited the ntttrances of Judge Gray in the Chinese exclusion cas, to the ef fect that the United States was a so;er etgn nation arwl passesed absolute .juris diction in all international affairs. "This doctrine was asserted by Webster," said Senator Piatt. "It was denied in the or dinances of secession but triumphantly reasserted in the victory of the Union. It j& too late to den it, it is time to be lieve in it," As a. nation the United States is sov ereign, he said, and possesses sovereign power, except in such cases where it is reserved to States or the people. He read from the Chinese exclusion act an opinion in reierenee to the jurisdiction over its own territory of an independent nation, showing that such jurisdiction is absolute. This, said Senator Piatt, would hardly be denied, but it was time to do some thing more than admit the nation's sov ereignty. The right to acquire territory was not reserved, and therefore was an inherent sovereign right. It had never been alleged, he said, that there was any reservation of that power. Senator Piatt said that the earliest re ported case bearing on the discussion was one signed by Chief Justice Marshall, who paid that the United States possessed the power to acquire new territory either by conquest or treaty. FOB A NATIONAL MILITARY RESERVE Representative S. W. Smith of Michi gan has Introduced a bill creating a na tional army reserve to be under the di rect control of the President. The bill provides that the national re serve shall consist of one regiment, eith er of infantry, artillery or cavalry, for oach CongrcesjonaKdistrict in the United States and one regiment for each Terri tory, and one regiment for the District oC Columbia. 3r time of peace, when not callel into actual service by the President, the regi ments of tlie national reserve are to ic- iHin skeletons only, and to consist of one colonel, one lieutenant colonel, two majors, twelve captains and twenty uigltt lieutenants. These officers are to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Sen ate? of the United States. They are to re ceive no pay until called into the sarvice of the United Slates. The officers of the field and staff of ihe regiments of the national reserve are to le appointed from among retired and ex olRecrs of the Regular Army, and from among the officers and ex-officers of th? National Guard or active uniformed mili tia of the several States. The reserve shall be constituted of in fantry, cavalry, and artillery, in the pro portion of seven-tenths- infantry, one tenth cavalry, and two-tenths artillery.

Asks if an Army OiHcer Can, "Within the Law He u Member of Congress. Mr. Bailey created a small sensation In the House today by arising: to a Question of privilege, and denouncing aa false a story that appeared in the "Washington Post this morning, charging that he had undertaken to get Gen. "Wheeler out of Congress In order to save Speaker Reed from the unpleasant necessity of doing the pami' thing. Mr. Bailey grew quite vehement in his denunciation of the publication. He offered a resolution of the highest privilege which was referred to the Judiciary Committee directing the committee to inquire whether any mem bers of Congress now hold a commission in the army; and if by so holding a com mission, such oues have not vacated their seats in the House. Mr. Bailey said Ms attention had been called by a member of the press, to the fact that Colson of Kentucky, and Camp bell of Illinois-, had answered present, as ' the Record and Journal show As to himself a member of the House. As to Colsonu Mr. Bailey desired the Judiciary Committee to make an inquiry. Mr. AYunger, of Pennsylvania, brought up the bill to appiopriate 

J350.COO for the permanent Philadelphia Commercial Mu- j-eum. The bill was pasted on a yea and nay vote. The IFouse-at- the opening of business today agreed to adjourn on AYednesday till January, i. The House adjourned at 2:43 p. m. THE PURE FOOD DILI, TOCOME TJP IN JANUARY The pure food bill will be taker! up by the House Committee on Commerce on the first Friday after the holidavs. The Secretary of Agriculture will be present. and will address the committee, urging the necessity of the bill. Immediately after this matter is dis posed of it is the present intention of the committee to take up the Nicaragua Ca nal bill, introduced by Representative Hepburn, or the Morgan bill, if that shall have been passed by the Senate b that time. Onthis question thcrp will undoubtedly be a battle royal in the committee, as well as afterwards on the floor of the House, the question of Government ownership and of the opposite policy of Govern ment, aid to private corporations being at i-sue. The matter is further complicated by charges that Mr. Hepburn is actuated In his request for Government ownership by a desire to delay or kill the project alto gether at the behest of the Pacific rail-w.-s, rather than by any idea that the purpose of his Mil can be brought about. On the other hand, it is urged that Government aid would produce hundreds of scandals like those that attended the building of the Pacific railways, while all these, it is claimed, can be avoided by turning the whole matter over to the Secretary of War and the Army engineers, and letting them be lcspon-ible for its ex ecution. MR.

Prompt AYorlc by Employes Prevented a Conllagration Contents "Were , Insured. Shortly before 1 o'clock this afternoon lire was discovered on the fourth floor of Stumph Brothers' mattress factory at the corner of Seventh and K Streets northwest. An alarm was turned In to which Com panies 1, C, Tand 14 responded promptly. When the firemen arrived the greater part of the contents of the floor was burning fiercely, and It was only by the hardest kind of work and the fact that the building Is fireproof that a big con flagration wav averted. On the fourth floor of the building where the .fire originated is stored the material used hi making mattresses, consisting of straw, hair, cloth and other exceedingly inflammable materials. The employes of the building fought the flames with chemicals kept in the build ing and it is due in a great measure to their 'efforts that the fire did not spread more rapidly. Several lir.es of hose were run Into the building and streams of water turned on the flames. After about" forty-five min utes' work the blase had been subdued, but not until the entire building had been flooded, and a large portion of the stock ruined. The damage to the building was slight, probably not more than $300. Edward Stumph, the secretary of the company, stated that he carried a stock worth about J25.0GO and that the damage would reach SIO.OO-J, fully coveied by in surance. Telegraph orders have already been sent to New York for material to replace that damaged by the fire, and work will soon be resumed.

The board of survey which last week examined and made soundings in the low er hay about the place where the Massa chusetts received her injuries, have not yet made public their report. It Is reported that they found that the tide was exceptionally low when the Mas sachusetts went down the harbor and that she struck a reef which hitherto had not been considered dangerous by pilots.

The first to speak wnjjs Dr. Rankin, who bestin by stating that Howrard University does not oppose the erection of the mu nicipal hospital, but to make plain certain reason why Froodmaifs Hospital might wisely be omitted from the project. He proposed that if Congress should see fit the University would barpcrfectly satis fled to have such a hospital constructed, provided the amount ibar would other wise be spent on colore warjlshe grant ed to the Uniersity for utt?in cllhlca and hospital set Ice. The plan of the promoter of the munici pal hospital project would practically do away with the Freodnwn's Hospitil.

SUCCESSOR- ID MR. BLISS Gentlemen Aspiring to Be Secretary of the Interior. Modification oJthe Civil Service Reform Rules Expected JJefore the New "Year Dawns. President McKInley will find matters of moment awaiting his disposition when he returns to Washington tomorrow from his Southern trip. Tlrcse Important matters were pending when he took his departure for the South, and therefore may be classed among the things which have been left undone. Immediate consideration will b2 given to the selection of a successor to Secre tary Bliss, whose resignation is now re garded as a foregone conclusion. There are several candidates for this Cabinet place, among them Thomas Ryan, First .Assistant Secretary of the Interior; .Webster Davis, 11. Clay Evans, j and a prominent New Yorker, whose r..i.ne is ior the present being "nld-icn under a. bushel measure," as one of his' friends expressed It. It is current belief that the resignation of Secretary Bliss will take effect on now-A ears Day. but should-a suitable selection not be made by that date Mr. Bliss' friends say he might be induced to serve, a week longer. It is thought, haw ever, that the Interior portfolio will bs presented to one of the candidates In the nature of a Christmas gift by the end of the present week. The appointment of Joseph II. Choate as ambassador to England will probablv be another Christmas gift. It Is stated In official circles that Mr. Choate's ap pointment was decided upon before Mr. McKinloy left for the South. The next important nomination to be made Is minister to Spain. As yet there are no candidates in sight for this berth, and it may develop into one of those rar ities, an office seeking- the man. The mends of Secretaiy I Taj say he is con sidering the advisability of recommend ing to the President the transfer of an experienced minister from some other foreign station to Madrid, in order that the acute conditions there may be dealt With properly and in order. Mr. McKinley realizes that steps will have to be taken at once looking to the restoration of the diplomatic machinerv necessary to friendly relations with Spain He will therefore i;ive careful considera tion to-the election 0f a, representative at the court of Madrid. The promulgation of the Executive civ il service order, which will ., ,,. which will sands of Government positions from the classified service, will take place soon aucr tlie President's return. This order is In readiness and only requires Mr. Mc Klnley's command to be given out for publics tlon. The Capt. Carter court-martial case Is also awailing promulgation. Addition al influence has been brought to bear on the President in the engineer officer's be half, but what effect this has exerted on .ur. -McKinley cannot be foretold. Army officers believe the sentence, as reduced, will be carried into effect before the bel ginning of the yeat'lS99. In this, however they may bo mista ken, as efforts are being made to have the papers "reviewed" again, after they have already passed through four "re views." The government of the Philippines is another- matter which will require im mediate attention, and Mr. McKinley will find, when he returnsfrom his holiday trip, that there are many matters await ing his consideration and action.
