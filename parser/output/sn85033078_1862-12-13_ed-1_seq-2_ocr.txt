THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Delirfred at the third Session of the Thir ty-seventh Congress, December Ist, 1862. Citizens of the Senate and House of Repre sentatives; Since year last assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has pas e(j and while it has not pleased the Al raighty to bless us with a return of peace, w e cannot but press on, guarded by the ‘ best light he gives us, trusting that in his own good time and wise way, all will be well. 

OITE FOREIGN GELATIONS. The correspondence touching foreign af fairs which has taken, place during the last year, is herewith submitted, in vir tual compliance with a request to that ef fect, made by the House of Representa tives near the close of the past session of Congress. If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at other periods, it has certainly been more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are, might have reasonably apprehended. In the month of June last, there were somegrounds to expect ihat the maritime powers which at the beginmng of our do mestic difficulties so unwisely and unsuc cessfully [unjustly ?] as we think, recog nized tiie insurgents as a belligerent pow er, would soon recede from that position -which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country, but the temporary reverses which afterwards befel the national arms and which were exaggerated by our own dit-loyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice. The civil war which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily in creasing throughout a period of halt a century. It has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In tins unusual agitation we have for borne taking part in any controversy be tween parties and factions in any such States. We have attempted no propa gandise! and acknowledged no revolution, but we have left to every nation the ex clusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been of course contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated ef fecta and the consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government even if it were just, would certainly he unwise. SUPPRESSION OF THE SLAVE TRADE. The treaty with Great Britain for the sup pression ot the slave trade has been put in to operation with a good prospect of com plete success. It is an occasion of es pecial pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Her Majes ty’s government has been marked witli a joalous respect for the authorities of the United States, and the rights or tiieir mor al and loyal citizens. The convention with Hanover for the abolition ot the State dues has been car ried into full effect under the act of Con gress for that purpose. VIOLATIONS OF NEUTRAL RIGHTS. A blockade of 3,000 miles of sea coast could not be established and vigorously enforced, in a season of great commer cial activity like the present, without committing occasional mistakes and in flicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil war, occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on a trade under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of com plaints of (he violations of natural rights. All such collisions tend to excite misap prehensions and possibly to produce mu tual recriminations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases ot these kinds, I have, so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have been preferred by friendly powers. There are, however, a large and augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the Govern ment is unable to agree with the Gov ernments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, more over, many cases in which the U. S. or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations, which the Governments cf these states are not at once prepared to redress. AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION. I have proposed to some of the foreign states interested, mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints.— This proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, France, Spain, and Prus sia. In each case it has been kindly re ceived, hut not yet formally adopted. THE CASK OF A NORWEGIAN BARK. I deem it my duty to recommend an appropria'ion in behalt of the owners of the Norwegian hark Admiral P. Forciens Hilda, which vessel was, in May, 1801, prevented by the commander of the block ading force off Charleston, from Laving that port with a cargo, notwithstading a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have di rected the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committee. AFRICAN EMIGRATION. Applications have been made to me by many tree Americans of African descent, to favor their emigration with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties at home and abroad, some from interested motives, others upon patriotic principles, and still others indnenced by philan thropic sentiments have suggested similar measures; while on the other hand seve ral of the Spanish American Republics have protested against the sending ot such colonies to their respective territories. Under these circumstances 1 have de clined to move any such colony to any State without first obtaining the consent of ts Government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants ia all their rights as freemen ; aad 1 have at the same time ollered to the several States situated in the tropics, or having coienies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration of portions of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions which shall bo equal, just and humane. Liberia and Hayti are yet the only coun tries to which colonists of Atricau descent from here could go with certainty ot being received and adopted as citizens, and 1 re gret to say that such persons contemplat ing colonization do not seem so willing to emigrate to these countries as to some others, nor so willing as, I think, their in terest demands. I believe, however, that the opinion is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and con siderable emigration to both these coun tries from the United fetates. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Saltan of Tur kev has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate’s consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending with the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the na tional commerce is expected to resnk from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European States, remain undisturb ed. Very favorable relations also continue to he maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan. OUR NEIGHBORING NATIONS. Daring the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the Independent S ales of our Conti nent, but more friendly sentiments, than have been heretofore existing, are believed to be entertained by those neighbors whose safety and progress are to intimate ly connected with our own. This state ment especially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru and Chili. The commission under the conven tion with the Republic of New Grenada closed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the convention that it may he able to do more complete justice. The commission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH, _ I have favored the project of connecting the United States witti Europe by an At lantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph to San Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph wire with the wire that is being extended across the Russian Empire. THE TERRITORIES. The Territories of the United States, with unimporlanL exceptions, have re mained undisturbed by the civil war, and they are exhibiting such evidence of pros perity a* justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be iu a condition to be organized us States and he constitutionally admitted into the Federal Union. The immense mineral resources of some of these Territories ought to he developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to im prove the revenues ot the Government and diminish the burdens ot the people. It is worthy of your serious considera tion whether some extraordinary measures to promote tins end cannot be adopted. The measure which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific explor ation of the minertd regions of those Ter ritories, with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries —results which cannot fail to he auspi cious. NATIONAL FINANCES. The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incidental to the mili tary and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion, have hitherto been met with a promptitude certainly unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully main tained. The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented force now in the field, demand your best reflection as to the best mode of providing the neces sary revenue without injury to business, and with the least possible burdens upon labor. The suspension of specie payment by the hanks, soon after the commence ment of your last session, made large is sues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and other just demands be so economically or as well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at least and for the time, the long-felt want of a uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discount and exchange, A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with a due regard to nil interests, should be kept in view. EVILS OF FLUCTUATION. Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point, will always he a leading purpose in wise legislation. Prompt and certain converti bility into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them, and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation ot United IStates notes, paya i ble in coin, and sufficiently large for the wants of the people, can he permanently, usefully and safely maintained. Is there any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can he made, and the great advantages of a sale and uniform currency secured ? A REMEDY PROPOSED. I know of none which promises so cer tain results, and st the same time so un objectionable, a s the organization of Bank ing Associations under a general act of Congress well guarded in its provisions. To c-uch associations the Government might furnish circulating notes on the se curity of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always with coin, would at once protect labor aga'nst the evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges. A moder ate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution ot the notes, and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as security. The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved, and the nego tiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand lor government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure—of con siderable weight in my judgment—that it would reconcile, as far as' possible, con flicting interests, by the opportunity offer ed to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and un secured, now issued by them. CONDITION OF THE TREASURY. The receipts into the Treasury from ail sources, including loans and balances from the preceding year, lor the fiscal yea; end ing ou the 30;h of June, 1862, were : * RECEIPTS. Customs 49,058.497 62 Direct tax 1,795,331 73 Public lands 152,203 77 Miscellaneous 931,789 64 Loans in all forms 525,692,360 50 Balance from last year 257,065 50 Total 533,885,247 66 The disbursements during the same pe riod were : DISBURSE ME STS. For Congressional, Executive and ju dicial purposes f5,939,009 29 For foreign intercourse 1,239,710 35 For miscellaneous expenses, includ ing the mints, loans, postoffice de ficiencies, collection of revenue, and other charges 14,129,771 50 For expenses under the Interior De partment 3,102,985 52 Under the War Department 394,368 407 38 Under the Navy Department 42.674’589 69 F'or interest on the public debt 13,190,324 45 For the payment of the public debt, including reimbursement of tem porary loan and redemption 96,096,923 09 Total 570,841,700 25 Balance in the treasury on the Ist day of July, 1862 13,043,446 SI It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,923 09 expended for disburse ments and redemption of the public debt being included also in the loans made, may properly be deducted both from the receipts and expenditures, leaving tl e ac tual receipts for thj year 487,788-- 324.97, and the expenditures 474,- 744,788.16. Other information ou the subject of the finances will be given in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statement and views I invite your most candid and conside rate attention. WAR AND NAVY REPORTS. The reports of the Secretary or the Navy and War, are herewith transmitted.— These report, though L-ngthy, are scarcely more than briet abstracts of the very nu merous and extensive transactions and op erations conducted through these depart ments, nor could 1 give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves. I therefore content myself by laying the reports before you, and asking your at tention to them. THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition ot the Post Office Department as compared with the several preceding years. The receipts for tie fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue trom ail States of the Union for three-quarters of that year. Notwith standing the cessation of revenue from the so-called confederate states during the last fiscal rear, tfie increase of the correspon dence of the loyal states has been suffici ent to produce a revenue during the same year ot $3,299,820 90, being Duly $50,000 less than was derived from all the IStates ot the Union the previous. The expenditures show a still more fa vorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,006.789 11. For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364 13, sbowirg a difference of about $2,487,000 in the expenditures, as compared with the preceding year, or about $3,750,000, as compared with the fiscal year ot 1860. The deficiency in the department for the previous year was $4,551,966 98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814 57. These favorable results are, in part, owing to the cessation of mail conveyance to the insurrectionary States, and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department, iu the interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service, u is believed, has also been much improved. POSTAL CONVENTION. The Postmaster General has opened a correspondence, through the department of Suite, with Foreign Governments, pro posing a convention of postal representa tives, for the purpose ot simplifying the rates of foreign postage, and to expedite *he foreign mails. This proposition, equal ly important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests ot this coun try, has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the Governments trom whom replies have been received., I ask the attention of Congress to the sugges tion of the Postmaster General in his re port respecting the further legislation re quired, iu his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to Public Lauds: The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the Ist of July, 1861, to the 30th of September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the sales of public lands were $137,477 26—a sum much lees than the expenses of our land system during the same period. The homestead law, which will take effect on the Ist of January next, offers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the General Land Office, and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market. The discrepancy between the sums here stated as arising from the sales of public lands and the sums derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury De partment, arises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods ot time, though appa rently, were not really coincident at the beginning point. The Treasury report includes a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently large to greatly over reach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by t e Inte rior, and not by the Treasury Department. * THE INDIAN DISTURBANCES. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit ot insubordination, and, at several points, engaged in open hostilities against the white settlers in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kausas renounced their allegiance to the United States, and entered into a treaty with the insurgents. Those who remain ed loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The chief of the Cher okees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained by superior torce to enter into treaties with the insur gents, and that the United States neglected to turnish the protection which treaty stipulation required. THE MINNESOTA MASSACRES. In the month of August last, the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the settlers in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women and children. This attack was wholly unex pected, and therefore no defense had been provided. It is estimated that no less than 800 persons were killed by the Indi ans, and a large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was in duced is not definitely known ; and suspi cions, which may be unjust, need not be stated. Information was received by the Indian Ilureau from different sources, about the time hostilities were commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes be tween the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The S'ate of Minnesota has suffered great injury trom the Indian war. A large portion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained by the uestruction ot property. The people ot that State manifest much anxiety tor the removal of the tribes be yond the limits of the State, as a guarantee against future hostilities. The Commission of Indian Affairs will furnish full details, REMODELING OF THE INDIAN SYSTEM. I submit for your special consideration whether our lodiau system shall not be re modeled. Many wise and good men have been impressed with the belief that this can be profitably done. PACIFIC RAILROAD AND THE SHIP CANALS. I submit a statement of the proceedings of the Commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enter prise of constracting the Pacific Railroad and would suggest the earliest completion cf the road, and also .the favorable action of Congress upon the project now pending before them tor enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and es- | pecially to the vast interior region herein after to be noticed at some greater length, I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and | valuable statistical information upon this j subject. The military and commercial im portance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River, is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now ■ transmitted to Congress. I respectfully ask your attention to it. THE AGRICULTURAL BUREAU. To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to be organized. The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this depart ment has established an exteasive system of correspondence and exchanges both at home and abroad, which promises to ef fect highly beneficial re-nits in the devel opment ot a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture in the intro duction of new products, and in the col lection ot agricultural statistics of the dif ferent States ; also, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, ce -1 reals, plants and cuttings, and has already j published and liberally diffused much vai ! uable information, in anticipation of a j more elaborate report which in due time I will be published, embracing some valua ; ble tests in chemical science now in pro -1 gross in the laboratory. The creation of ; this department was for the more imme i diate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the lib i erai basis upon which it has been organ ized wiil not only meet your approbation, | but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most i sanguine friends, and become the fruitful j souice of advantage to all our people. EMANCIPATION. On the 22d day of September last a j proclamation was issued by the Executive —a copy of which is herewith submitted. | In accordance with the purpose expressed i in the second paragraph of that paper I I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called compensated emanci pation. A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people and its laws.— The territory is the only part which is of certain durability. u One generation pas seth away and another generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever.” It is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part. THE UNION ONE AND INSEPARABLE. That portion of the earth’s surface which is owned and inhabited by the people ot the United States is well adapted to be tne home of one national family. It is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climate and pro duction are of advantage in the age of our people, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, and telegraphs and intelligence, have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people. THE FOLLY OF DISUNION. In the Inauguration Address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of dis union as a remedy tor difficulties between the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve and which, therefore, I beg to repeat. “ One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it to be wrong and ought not to be ex tended. This is the only substantial dispute . The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution and the laws, lor the suppression of the African slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the law itself. The great body ot the people abide by the legal obligations in both cases, and a few break over each. This I think cannot he perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both instances after the separation of the sections than before. The for eign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be, ultimately, revived without restriction in one section, while fugitives now only partially surren dered would not be surrendered at all to the other. “ Physically speaking, we cannot separate ; we cannot remove our respective sections irom each other, nor build an impassable wall between; hem. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse cither amicable or hostile must con tinue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satis factory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than ft tends can make laws? Cau treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than ’aws can among friends ? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss ou both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old ques tions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.” HO SUITABLE LINS OF DIVISION. There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide. Trace through from East to West, upon the line between the free and slave country, and we shall find a lit tle more than one-third of its length are rivers easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated thickly, upon both sides, while in nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors’ linwj over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their pres ence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper, or parchment, as a nation al boundary. WIUT SECESSION SURRENDERS. The fact of separation if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding section, the fugitive slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations, upon the sec tion seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place. “ TEE GREAT BODY OF THE REPUBLIC.” But there is another difficulty. The great interior region—bounded east by the Alleghanies, north by the British Do minions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along which the cultivation of corn and cotton meets—and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Michi gan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, lowa, Minnesota, and the territories of Dacotah, Nebraska, and a part of Colora do, has above ten millions of people, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, it not prevented by any political tolly or mistake. It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the revolted States—certainly more than one million of surface miles. One-half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than seventy-five millions of people. A glance at the map shows that, territo rially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic. The other parts are but mar ginal borders to it, the magnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources in the production of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceeds from them. This great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect pre sented. And yet this region lias no ?ea coast and touches no ocean anywhere. its natural outlets. As part of one nation, its peoole now may find and may forever find their way to Europe by New York, to South Ameri ca and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco. Bat separate our common country into different nations as designed by the present rebellion, and ev" ery man in this great interior region is thereby cut off from someone or more of these out.et?, uot perhac-g bv a phyrica' barrier, but by embarrassing' and onerous trace regulaiiocs, and this is true wher ever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Piace it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Ken tucky, or north of the Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to my port or place south of it, exoept upon terms dic tated by a Government foreign to them. outlets East, West, and South, are indispensable to the well being of the peo ple inhabiting, and to inhabit this vast in terior region. Which the three may be the best is no proper question. Ail are bette? than either, and all of right belong to that people and their successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather, that there shall be no such line. A 

COMMON INTEREST. Nor are the marginal regions less inter ested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world. They do, and each one ot them must have access to the Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary. Oar national life springs not from our permanent past, nor trom the lauds we ' inhabit, but. from our national homestead. There is no possible swerving ot this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its applications and at titudes it demands union, and abhors sep aration. In fact, it would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treas ure the separation might Lave cost. Oar strife pertains to ourselves, to the passing generations of men, and it cannot, without convulsion, be hushed forever, with the passing of one generation. AMENDMENTS TO TITE CONSTITUTION. With this view I recommend the fol lowing resolution and articles, amendatory to the Constitution of the United States: Resolved, By the Senate and House of Represen tatives of the United States of America in Con gress assembled, two thirds of both Houses concur ring, that the following articles be proposed to the legislatures or conventions of the several States, as amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all, or any of which articles when ratified by three-fourths of the said legislatures or con ventions to be valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, namely : COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION. Article —. Every State wherein slavery now ex ists, which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before the first of January, in the year of our Lord 1900, shall receive compensation irom the United States In bonds, bearing interest at the rate of—, for each slave shown to have been therein by the eighth census of the United States, said bonds to be delivered to such States, by installments, or in one parcel, at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one time within such State, and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid and afterwards. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid, e J afterwards introducing or tolerating slavery f erein, shall refund to the United States the jds so received, or the value thereof, and all in i’ est paid thereon. OP SLAVES FREED BY THE WAR. Article — . All slaves who shall have enjoyed ac tual freedom by the chances of war ac any time before the end of the rebellion, shall be forever free; but all owners of such who shall not have been dislojal, shall be compensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such a way that no slave shall be twice accounted for. VOLUNTARY COLONIZATION IN THE V. S. Article — . Congress may appropriate money or otherwise to provide for colo using free colored persons with their own consent at any place or places within or without the United States. THE ARGUMENTS THEREFOR. I beg indulgence to discuss these pro posed articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion would never have existed ; without slavery it could not con tinue. Among the friends of the Union there is a great diversity of sentiment and policy in regard to slavery ami the Afri can race amongst us. Some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation, and some would abolish it gradually and with compensation. Some would remove the free people from us, and ome would retain them with us, and there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities wo waste ranch strength in struggles amongst onrselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize and act together. This would be a compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual conces sion. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of the States. earmonizing differences. In the first article the main points are : Fir , The emancipation. Second , The length of time for consummating, in years ; and Third, The compensation. The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction. The Lime saves both races from the evils of sudden derange ment, while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its c nrummatioc. They will never see it Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate the length of time. The} will feel that it goes tor little to the now living slaves, but it really gives them much. It eaves them from the|vagrant destitution winch mmt largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where the circumstances are very great, and It gives the inspiring as surance that the’r posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it to abolish slaver} 7 now or at the end of the century, or at any inter mediate time, or by degrees extending over tiie w hole or any part 01 *hat period ; and it obliges no two states to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and generally the mode of making it. — This, it would seem, must further miti gate the dissatisfation of those who favor perpetual slavery, especially of those who are to receive compensation. WHY COMPENSATE. Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object to it. That the measure is both just and economical is certain. The liberation of the slaves is the destruction of property acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true fur hav ing been often said, that the people of the South are no more responsible for the in troduction of tins property than are the people of the North; and when it is re membered how unhesitatingly we a!! use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the Soutli has been more re sponsible than the North for its continu ance, If, then, for a common object, this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge ? And it with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means, than we can by the war alone, is it. not economical to do it ? AN ECONOMICAL VIEW. Let us consider it then : let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was pro | posed last March, and consider whether, if that measure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. It so, the measure would save money ; and in that view, would be a prudent and econ omical measure, certainly. It is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a large sum than a larger one. The aggregate sum necessary to com pensate emancipation of course would be large, but it would require no ready cash, nor bonds any faster than the emancipa tion progresses. SEARING TEE BURDEN WITH POSTERITY. This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the thirty seven years. At that time we shall prob ably have 100,000,000 people to share the burden, instead of 31,000,000 as now, and not only so, but the increase of our popu lation may be expected to continue for a long time after the period as rapidly as before, because our territories will not have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the sams ratio of in crease which we have maintc-ined on an average from our first national census in 1790 until 1860, we shonld in 1900 have a population of 103,208-415, and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period? Our abundant room, (ur broad national homestead, is an ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British isles, certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to send part of the, native born away ; but such is not our condition. We have 2,903,000 of square miles. Eu rope has 3,809,000 square miles, with a population averaging 73i persons to the square mile. Why may not our country at some time average as many ? Is it less fertile ? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, and other causes ? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantages ? PROSPECTIVE GROWTH OF POPULATION". If then we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how soon ? As to when this may be, we may judge of the past and present. As to when it will be, if ever, will depend much on whether we j maintain the Union. Several of our i States are above the average of European i population, of to the square mile. I Massachusetts has 157, Rhode Island 133, New York and New Jersey each SO; also two other great States, Pennsylvania and ! Ohio, are not far below, the former having '63 and the latter 59. The States already above the European average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before, while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our country in natural ca pacity for sustaining a dense population. Taking the raio in the aggregate, we find its population and ratio of increase for the several decimal periods as follows : RATIOS OF INCREASE, i Years. Population. Rates. ! 1790 3,929,827 1800 5,305,937 35.62 j 1810 7,239,814 36.45 1820 9,638,191 33.13 IScO 12,866,020 33.49 1840 17,059,453 32.67 1850 23,191,876 35.87 1860 31,445,080 35.68 This shows an average decennial in crease of 34.60-100 per cen\ in popula tion through the seventy years from our | first to our last census taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of these seven periods is either j two per cent, below or two per cent, above I the average. Thus showing how inflexi- I ble and consequently how reliable the law of increase in our case is. Assuming that it will continue, it gives the following results : RATIO CARRIED FORWARD. Years. Population, 1870 42,323,372 1880 56,966,216 1890 76,677,872 1900 103,208,415 1910 138,918,526 1920 c 186,984,335 1930 251,680,914 These figures show our country may be as populous as Europe at some point be tween 1920 and 1930, say about 1925, our territory at 73£ to the square mile being of capacity to contain 217,186,384. This future we relinquish by the folly and evils of disunion, or by long exhausting war springing from the only great element of discord among us, while il cannot be fore seen exactly how much one huge example of secession, bringing lesser ones, would indefinitely retard the population, civili zation and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious. GREAT BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED PLAN, The proposed emancipation would shor ten this war, perpetuate peace, insure the increase in population, and proportionably the increase in the wealth of the country. With this we should pay all that emanci pation would cost, with our other debts, easier than we should pay our other debts without it. A COMPARISON. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 per cent, per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolution ary struggle till to-day, without paying anything, either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then, and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been great er than six per cent., and has run faster than the interest upon the debt. THE COMPENSATIONS OF TIME. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt. This fact would be no excuse for delaying the payment of what is justly due, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection, and the great ad vantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100,000,000, what by a different policy we would have to pay now when the number is 31,000,000. In a word it shows that a dollar will he much harder to pay Jar the war, than a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan, and then the latter will cost no Wood, no precious lif . It will be a sav ing of both. OF THE RETURN OF FUGITIVES. As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bon ! - age the class of persons therein contem plated. Some of then doubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners, and hence provision is made in this arti cle for compensating sueh. THE FUTURE OF THE FREED MEN. The third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige but merely authorizes Congress to aid in col onizing such as may consent. This ought not be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other, inasmuch as it comes to naught unless by mutual consent of the people to be deported and the American voters through their representa tives in Congress. THE PRESIDENT FAVORS COLONIZATION, BUT EXPOSES OBJECTIONS TO THE NE GROES REMAINING. i I cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor coloniza tion, and yet I wish to say that there is an objection against the colored persons rcm ining in the country, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious. It is insisted that their presence would in jure and displace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere arguments that time surely is not now'. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not wi lingly be responsible through time and eternity. In it true , then, that the colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slave? If they stay in their own places, they jostle no white laborers. If thay leave their old places, they leave them open to white la borers. Logically, there is neither more or less of it.
