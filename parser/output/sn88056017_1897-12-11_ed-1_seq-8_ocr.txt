Th« Blackfoot PUBLISHED EVEET SATTEDAT One y«r .LM Three for (LACITOOT. IDAHO. DF. KMBEB U. W. President McKinley s first annual has been given to Congre». of President», it is Like other severely criticised by some and approv ed by others. Conservative aa the President rims to be, it is plain to The News that his recommendations in regard to the main •objects of which he writes will not be without criticism even from the most loyal Republicans. His recommenda tions will not command n united par ty following. Every issue which he may win in Congre», will be won after the fiercest straggle. His friends will be ^taxed for all the parliamentary tactics, ingenuity and diplomacy at their com mand to keep the President in the lead on the three subjects which be makes most prominent. In brief, the message makes the Cur rency, the Cuban question and the An nexation of Hawaii, the three chief sub jects, The larger part is devoted to the discussion of them. Concerning the Currency the President recommend» that National banks be allowed to issue notas to the face value of bonds depos ited by them—that National banks of •25,000 capital be authorized, and the estoppel of the endless chain by which the gold reserve is depleted. Concerning Cuba, he is opposed to giving the insurgents billigerem rights and favors time to test Spam's policy of autonomy. He urges the annexation of the Ha waiian Islands as a logical sequence of present conditions, but admits that the population is not altogether fitted to share the duties and responsibilities of American citizenship. On other subjects: He favors civil service and promises to foster it He recommends the military for Alaska; be wants a yellow fever investigating commission, and is in favor of building a strong Navy. The News is looking (or exciting times in Congress, growing out of the discussion of the Currency, Cuban and Hawaiian questions. There will be many word to word battles. The Pres ident will be without a united party fol lowing, and it will be amusing to see his party take refuge under the shelter ing statement that the three subjects do not involve party politics, that they are questions which all the people may consider with impartial minds. Hanna's Chances Slim. Washington, Dec. 4.—You may put it down as a certainty that Mark Hanna will not be elected to the Sen ate by the Ohio legislature," said CoL Ike Hill to-day. He has been deputy sergant-at-arms of the national house of representatives for a number of years; and be has been one of the most active and energetic Democratic workers in Ohio for a full generation. He under stands the Ohio situation as well as Mark Hanna, John R. McLean, Senator Foraker or any of the politicians. "It all depends on Charley Kurtz's backbone," says Col Hill. "Every man in Ohio knows that Charley Kurtz has backbone and plenty of nerve. If he maintains his reputation for political courage, Mark Hanna will be beaten. It only requires three anti-Hanna Republi cans in the legislature to defeat Hanna; and Kurtz says that he has fourteen men pledged under oath never to vote for Hanna. Of course out of fourteen men it is fair to presume that some may change their minds or weaken under certain influeuce. But inasmuch as it only requires three anti-Banna Repub licans to defeat Hanna, I am satisfied that he will be defeated. "When you want men who will fight and stay in a fight with you until you win or lose, you must have men under forty years of age, as a general thing. Well the men from Cleveland are all young men, and they are all against Hanna. They have been fighting him for three years, and he has never asked a compromise nor even consented to a compromise. Hanna himself has made It a war to the death. The relentless ncss of it all rests on Hanna and his uncompromising disposition. Those young men know that they can expect no quarter from Hanoa at any time or under any circumstances. Therefore, while they have it In their power to down Hanna they are going to do it. No amount of money or fcdoral patron age can Induce them to let up on their natural political foe. They have him by the throat, and they will never lot go their clutch. I think Hanna knows this as well as anybody." , Nevcrtheless and notwithstanding these Washington telegrams The News believes it will be Hanna, Mark A. Uauiia.

Every New Woman in Christendom should read and profit by Mrs. Hetty Green's receipt for raising daughters. As the richest woman in America and as the creater of her immense fortune, Mrs. Green is pointed out by the New Woman as an exemplification of what the sex would be capable of accomp lishing if enfranchised and endowed with advantages in the laws of the land. Bat this female wizard of finance shows by her talk on the homely topic of bringing up children that she is a very Old Woman and has no sympathy with the enfranchising movement. What Mrs. Green has to say about the rearing of her daughter is com mended to every mother in the land. "I have reared Sylvia according to my ideas of the proper training for woman hood" says this remarkably sensible Mrs. Hetty Greene in speaking of her only daughter, who will some day in herit a fortune of tens of millions. "I have told her often that I do not like to see women in the business world, that it is an unnatural life for them, and that they should never go into it unless they are forced to do bo. I have held constantly before her that home is the place of safety and happiness for wom an. I am glad that she does not go about with the airs of a Grand Duchess. 1 would feel that my training was in vain if she was not modest and retiring. It is not an inspiring, but a depressing sight to me, that of a woman in the front ranks and under the fierce glare of public life." There is a touch of the old-fashioned way of bringing up girls in this talk of one of the most conspicuous women in the world that must forcibly impress those who read it. It Is reminicent of the manners of a time when the real foundation of American character was being laid. This sensible daughter of a sensible mother Is American to the core, and it is safe to rely upon her not entertaining the European marriage market and purchasing a title to which small manhood is attached, as so many rich girls of this country have done.— St. Louis Republic. The interview accorded The News by ex-Senator Fred T. Dubois, and re ported in another column of to-day's issue is short but brimful and running over with facts worthy of the most ae rious consideration, The annexation of Hawaii Involves a question of great interest to the gen eral public at this time—the President has made it, in his annual message, one of the most important for discus «ion by Congress, and for these reasons all tacts relating to life and conditions on the islands will be most carefully considered. Senator Dubois has just returned from a visit to the Hawaiian Islands. He was careful in bis observations and in collection of facts; they are fresh in his mind, and as he gives them for The News it cannot be surprising that he opposes annexation. It will not be surprising that any one with these facts of life and conditions on the island should oppose it. A rock girt isle in mid ocean, with an un American population, would be an empty acquisition, one that the coun try could never be proud of—one that it could never point to with pleasure, pride and honor. Senator Morgan, of Alabama, says that the possession of Hawaii is neces sary for protecting California and Alas ka in the coming war with our "tradi itional enemy,Great Britian." But who is to protect, Hawaii in the event of such a war? Would not the fleets and fortifications required for Hawaii prove more effective for national defence nearer home? Is it necessary to fortify a military outpost 2,000 miles from the California coast in order to protect San Francisco from bombardment, when batteries in the harbor would be mach more to the purpose?—Philadelphia Record. If the silver Republicans are not satisfied with the result of the bime tallic commission's labors, there seems, at any rate, to be abundant room for the gold Republicans to be pleased with the outcome of the administra tion's efforts to throttle any possible capacity for good that the commission might have possessed. A glittering farce appears to have been played, but it is more apt to draw tears than cheers from the spectators.—San Francisco Examiner. Distance Lends Enchantment. "I understand your uncle brought 1800,000 back from the Klondike." "No." "No? Why, that was certainly the report.'' "Yes. That was the report at Daw son City, but when he got to Ht. Micha els rumor let it drop to *625,000. "Well that's a pretty good sura. "Of course it is but after ho had sailed we got word that the actual value of his nuggots probably wouldn't ceed *380,000." Still he could do the handsomething by you if he wanted to." "No doubt about that at all but when he lauded at Seattle the uewspuper re '• »I ox .. ports from there gave his fortune at only •110,000." "Even that Is a good deal of money." "Very true but the next time we heard from him he was in Kan Fran cisco and the best they could make of It there was a little lees than «50,000." "Pretty good pay for a year's work anyway." "Unquestionably; but he reached Chicago this morning with a letter of credit for •3,514, which represented the total value of the gold that he and his partner had brought down and deliver ed at the San Francisco Mint, and they want me to board them for nothing all winter so that they can have that for their expenses when they want to go back in the spring. It is strange, indeed, that some for tunes that seem as big as a house at a distance cannot be seen with the naked eye when they get into the same ward with us.—Chicago "Evening Post." - Boiled Eggs for Alaska. A Canadian tanner sees millions in boiled eggs for Alaska. He is preparing several hundred thousand for shipment in early spring. Ho has a clay preparation in which he enca ses each one and which he claims will keep them perfectly fresh. Ho will not get them there for Christmas or Easter but will have them on hand for the Fourth of July picnics.
