Domestic science teachers and food authorities are urging the housewife to carefully read the labels on all food articles. The laws of most States compel food manufacturers to print the ingredients of their products on the label, and this enables consumers to distinguish health.. Iul foods from those which may be deleterious. High-grade baking powders ar. made of pure cream of tartar, derived from grapes. Royal Bakli ing Powder is a type of the highest grade. It is healthful beyond q doubt and the safest and best to use. The low-grade baking powder. bre made from alum, a mineral Raid salt, or phosphate of lime, Consumers can learn the char" "'oter of the baking powder by referring to the label, which aust state whether the contents. ,include cream of tartar, alum or phosphate.

It is difficult to handle this business so that all pack ages and letters may be delivered in time for Christmas, If senders of packages wait until the last moment Lo mail them. It is therefore asked that presents sent by mail shall be purchased and mailed as early as possible. This will not only be ap preciated by the postmaster, but merchants will be greatly relieved from the rush of Chrlstmsa buying. It Is important that parcels shall be properly wrapped and plainly ad Iressed. Parcels should also bear the insctiption: "Not to be opened until Christmas,"- so that early shipments will hot only insure reach ing destination but will serve the E purpose of Christmas giving. It is advisable to insure registered mud C. O. D. parcels. The cost is I nly three cents for packages up to = )5.00; $5.00 to $25.00, 5" cents; t )25.00 to $50.00, 10 cents; $50.0t c o $100, 25 cents. r OnDecember 15th, 1915 We Distribute to Our Depositors in the 1915 CHRISTMAS SAVINGS CLUB $5,770.24.

Frederick Building Boston Street "4 o PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. f The states of America are not hos t tile rivals but co-operating friends, and their growing sense of commini ty of interest, alike in matters po i-litical and matters economic, is like t ly to give them a new signicance as factors in international affairs and Ilin the political history of the world. Pan-Americanism has none of the r spirit of empire in it. It is the em bodiment, the effectual embodiment, of tle spirit of law and independ ence and liberty and mutual service. Conquest and dominion are not in I our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. But just because we de mand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free na tional development to the incidents and movements of affairs which ar fect only ourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries to walk in these difecult paths of in dependence and right. From the first we have set America aside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a people I against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicto torial power within our own nation C as of aggression from without. The great merchant- fleet we once used to make us rich, that great body t of sturdy soldiers wh oused to carry' our flag into every sea, and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neg lect and indifference and Iy & hope- c lessly blind and provincial policy of so-called economic protection. It is a high time we repaired our mistake s and resumed our commercial inde pendence on the seas. Our independence is provincial, and is only on land and within our own borders. We are not likely to be permitted to use even the ships b of other nations in rivalry of their it own trade, and are without means to extend our commerce even where; the dodrs are wide open and the goods desired. Such a situation is not to be endured. It is of capital importance not only f that the United States should be its vi own carrier on the seas and enjoy 1J the economic independence which only an adequate merchant marine - would give it, but that the American hemisphere as a whole should enjoy a like independence and self-sumcl ency, if it is not to be drawn into | the tangle of European affairs. Without such independence the Have your brick and cement work done by experienced ate. glet a trils tore, but you have the satisfactin of Its behlg welD dam 0. J. 

RENE, Contractor. P. 0. Rot 17S. P bas l. . whole question of our political unity and self-determination is very se riously clouded and complicated in deed. We can develop no true or Ameri can policy without ships of our own -not ships of war, but ships' of peace, carrying goods and carrying much more: creating friendships and rendering indispensable services to all interests on this side of the water. When th erisk has passed and pri vate capital begins to find its way in sufteient abundance into these new channels, the government may withdraw. But it cannot omit to be gin. It should take the firstatep and should take them at once. It is a plain counsel of prudence to continue all of the present taxes or their equivalents, and confine our selves to the problem of providing $112,000,000 new revenue rather, than $297,000,000. It seems. to me a clear dictate of prudent statesman ship and frank finance that in what we are now, I hope, to u.dertake we should pay as we go. There are citizens of the Unite: States, I blush to admit, born under those flags, but welcomed by our generous naturalization laws to the full feedom and opportunity of America, who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life; who have sought tQ bring the authority and good name of our government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes, and to strike at them and to debase our policies to the uses of foreign intrigue. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed out. The! are not many, but they are infinitely malignant and the hand of our power should close over them at once. The transportation problem is an exceedingly serious and pressing one in this country. There has been from time to time of late reason to fear that our railroads would not - be much longer able to cope with it successfully, as at present equip ped and co-ordained. I suggest that a it would be wise to provide a com mission of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole qeus- C tion whether our laws as at present tramed and administered are as ser viceable as they might be in the so lution of the problem.
