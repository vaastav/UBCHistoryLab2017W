13 the Reichstag tag wan dissolved in consequence oft t Its refusal to vote the supplementaryappropriation appropriation demanded for GermanSouthwest Southwest Africa by tho OovernmentThia Thia ia not the first time in the historyof of the present German Empire thatthia this instrument of coercion has beenused used to break down the resistance ofthe the popular assembly The possibilityof of a resort to such an expedient showshow how widely the German Constitutiondiffers differs from that of Great Britain orthat that of the United StatesWe p We need not say that under our Federal eral Constitution the President has nopower power to dissolve Congress though hemay may convoke it in extra session InFranco France the President of the republic ifhe I he can procure the consent of the Senatemay may dissolve Parliament and order theelection election of a new Chamber of DeputiesIn In Great Hritain and in most othercountries countries which have adopted the parliamentary liamentary an distinguished from thopresidential presidential type of government thepower r power of dissolution is the complementof of the responsibility of the Ministersand and theoretically is used to ascertainwhether whether the Cabinet possesses tho confidence fidence of the nation In the GermanEmpire Empire Ministerial responsibility doesnot not exist any more than it exist in thoUnited United States and it seems thereforeunreasonable unreasonable that the power of dissolution tion should be vested in the executiveand and Bundeurath conjointly Nevertheless less the voters have upheld the ImperialGovernment Government when it has applied thisformidable formidable Instrument of pressure to thepopular b popular branch of tho national legislature ture Tho Reichstag has been thricodissolved dissolved once in 1878 when it refusedto to pass a bill for the repression of agitation tion by the Socialists next in 1887 whenit p it rejected a bill fixing the size of thearmy army for seven years and lastly in 1893when when it refused to sanction changedproponed proponed in the military system Ineach each case tho electors virtually said thatthe the executive was right and the legislature lature wrong for the new Reichstagaccepted L accepted the plans of the GovernmentThus Thus tho adjustment of the ultimateauthority authority of the different organs of thoState State was postponedThe The truth is that the Reichstag Is farfrom from playing in Germany the great partwhich which Is played by the Chamber of Deputies ties in France On paper the powers ofthe the former body like those of the latterare are great but in practice the Germanassembly assembly has not been able to turn todecisive decisive account ita nominal control ofthe the purse All laws indeed require thoconsent consent of the Reichstag and so do thebudget c budget all loans and all treaties thatinvolve involve matters falling within the domainof of legislation But although the Constitution i tution declares that the budget shall boannual annual the principal revenue laws arepermanent permanent and cannot be changed without Iout I out the consent of tho Bimdesrath orFederal Federal Council Then again the mostimportant important appropriation that for thearmy army has hitherto been voted for a number ber of yearn at a time A similar courser r has boon pursued with reference to thonavy 4 navy In tho debates on the budgetthe the Deputies indulge freely in criticismof of the Government hut an a nilo thoreductions reductions made aro unimportant andcomplete complete rejection of an appropriationdemanded demanded has been extremely rareThe The extent to which the Reichstag issubordinated subordinated to the Hundesrath is imperfectly I perfectly appreciated in the UnitedStates States Every one of the fiftyeightmembers members of tho Bundesrnth has a rightto to sit in tho Reichstag and to sicaktherein therein whenever he chooses That into to ay the Bundesrath han noino of thoAttributes Attributes of an Imperial Cabinet andtechnically technically Interpellations in tho Rcichstag tag aro addresser tp the Hundcsraththough though in tact they lire are communicated cated to the Chancellor who himself hasno no right to sit in the Reichstag exceptas as a delegate to the Bundesrath Practically tically the Bundesrath has the first aswell well as the last word on almost all tholaws I laws for the Reichstag has not succeeded Iceeded ceeded in making its right of initiativein in legislation very effective By far thelarger larger part of tho statutes as well as thebudget 1 budget are prepared and first discussedby by the Bundesrath They are then sentj j r I to the Keichjstag and if paaaed by thatbod body are submitted once more to theBundesrath Bundesrath for approval The Bundearath rath is not only the main source of legislatfon Illation but it la also a part of thoexecutive executive enjoying a share of the powerof of appointment From another point ofview view it may be compared to our UnitedStates States Supreme Court for it decidesdisputes disputes between the Imperial and StateGovernments Governments about the interpretation ofImperial lmperlal statutes Not only has theBundesrath Bundesrath far more extensive powersthan than the Reichstag but it also possessesprivileges privileges withheld from the latter bodyFor For instance the Reichstag cannot besummoned summoned to meet without the Bundesratri rat whereas the latter can sit aloneIn In the Reichstag the order of business Ubroken broken off by theending of the sessionwhereas whereas In the Bundesrath it is continuous ous so that matters may be taken upagain again at the point where they were leftWe We observe lastly that the meetings oftho the Bundesrath may be secret and infact fact the public is always excludedthough though a brief report of the mattersdealt dealt with and the conclusions reachedis is published after each sessionIt It is evident that in the Reichstag theGerman German people possess only the semblance blance of selfgovernment The principal pal organ legislation is thdBundesrathwhich which represents not the people but thesovereigns sovereigns of the constituent StatesSamuel Samuel Gompers and John SlltehtllWe We note with interest the continueddisapproval disapproval the part of Messrs SAMUKb rET 

GOMPERB and JOHN MITCHELL ofwhat what they are pleased to describe asgovernment government by injunction Those passionate sionate advocates of human liberty bothappeared appeared at the fifth annual meetingof of the National Civic Federation lastWednesday Wednesday and both declared themselves selves in no measured terms as deadlyfoea fOUl of the injunction Mr Jour MITCHELL ELL indeed went so far as to say that under circumstances prvocation cation he would trample the Injunctionunder under foot as a tyrannical interferencewith with his constitutional rightsOf Of course the seeming inconsistencyof of this attitude assumed by gentlemenwho who have consecrated themselves tofreedom freedom in its broadest and its noblestforms forms is susceptible of explanationSuperficially Superficially considered however it willastonish astonish the unenlightened t hearMessrs Messrs OOMPBBS and MITCHELL denoucing nouncing with < such bitterness the onlyremaining remaining protection of the individualin in pursuit of the privileges guaranteedhim him by our political and social institutions tions The appearance is deceptive nodoubt doubt but tho ordinary citizen sees intho tho injunction merely an effort by theGovernment Government to save the lives of menwho who seek t support themselves andtheir their families through the medium ofhonest honest toil We know how it grievesMessrs Messrs GOMPEBS and MITCHELL to hearof of workingmen beaten maimed evenmurdered murdered because they accept employment ment We know it because they alwaysproclaim proclaim their sorrow on those barbarousoccasions occasions Their hem ore always lacerated ated in such caVfl for surely there canbe b no more brutal tyranny than thatwhich which would deny tho poor mans rightto to labor for his daily bread Nevertheless less only the inspired few who enjoycommunion communion with Messrs GOMPEBS andMITCHELL MITCHELL are able to perceive in theinjunction injunction anything more or lees thanthe the agency of that liberty of which theyprofess profess to be the appointed and peculiarprophets prophets Some day we feel sure theseerrors erroni will b dispelled For the moment ment however they possess us with remarkable markable tenacityIt I is a great pity that Messrs GoMFERfland and MITCHELL did not find time to explainto t their distinguished audience the exactmanner manner in which and tho precise extentto to which injunction interferes with thehuman human liberty they extol so eloquentlyand and apostrophize with such voluble andmore more or less convincing vociferationThe multitude in it onlyon The ignorant multudo sees an attempted safeguard too often ineffectual fectual of the honest weak a againstthe the murderous and ruffian strong I amounts or 1 m amount merelyto to an inhibition of lawlessness Itsostensible ostensible function in t prevent thoassemblage assemblage of ruffians and malefactorat at points where nonunion workmenmay may be assaulted mutilated even killedoutright outright under circumstances which forbid bid tho hope of Identifying and punishing ing the criminals Why then shouldMessrs Messrs GOMPEBS and MITCHELL denounce Inounce nounce It with such penetrating virulence claim that theseabominable I lence They always caim tht thee abominable enormities are committed bysympathizera sympathizera whoso activities theyhonestly honestly deplore If that bo true as ofcourse course it must be why do they not coperate operate with the agents of humane andcivilized civilized government in tho effort telminate eliminate themIt I i inconceivable
