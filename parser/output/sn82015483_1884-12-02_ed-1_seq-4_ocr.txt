The "War Department. Tn fli. ovtmwihm of the War department the Secretary reports a decrease of more than $9,000,000. Of this reduction $5,600,000 was effected in the expenditures for rivers and har bors and $2,700,000 in the expenditures tor the quartermaster's aepartmeitt. uuuo i that department the annual expenses of all thej army bureaus proper, with the excep tion of the ordnance bureaus, are substan tially fixed charges which cannot tie mate rially diminished without a change in tne numerical strength oi tne army. iu e nanditnrn in the auartermaster's department can readily be submitted to administrative discretion, and it is reported by the Secretary of War that, as a result of such discretion, in reducing the number of draught and pack animals in the army, tne annual co m ou plying and caring for such animals is now $1,108,085.90 less than it was in 1882. 

RIVERS AKD HARBORS. The funds with which the works for the improvement of rivers and harbors were prosecuted during the past year were de rived from the appropriations of the act of August 2, 1882, together with such few bal ances as were on hand from previous ap propriations. Tho balance in the treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1883, was $10,021,649. The amount appropriated dur ing the fiscal year 1884 was 1,319,034.62, and the amount drawn from the Treasury during the fiscal vear was $8,228,703.54, leaving a balance -of $3,112,580.63 in the Treasury.subject to repudiation July 1, 1884. SEA COAST DEFENSES. The Secretary of War submits the report of the chief of engineers as to the practica bility of protecting our important cities on the seaboard by fortifications and other de fenses able to repel modern methods of at tack. The time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive, and when the possible result of delay in making such pre paration is seriously considered, delay seems inexcusable. For the most important cities, those whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation, adequate defenses, inclusive of guns, may be made by the gra dual expenditure of $60,000,000, a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribution. An appropriation of about one-tenth of that amount is asked to begin the work, and I concur with the Secretary of War in urging that it be granted. The War department is proceeding with the conversion of ten-inch smooth bore guns into eight-inch rifles by lining the former with tubes of forged or of coiled wrought iron. Fifty guns will be" thus converted within the year This, however, does not obviate the necessity of providing means for the construction of guns of the highest rawer, both for the purposes of coast de fense and for the armament of war vessels. The report of the eun foundry board, ap pointed April 2, 1883, in pursuance of the act of March 3. 1883. was transmitted to fionoTRsa in a special message of February 8, 1884. In mv message of March 26. 1884, I called attention to the recommendation of the board, that the eovernment should en courage the production of private steel works of the required material for heavy cannon, and that two government factories, one for army and one for navy, should be establish ed for the fabrication of guns from such ma terial. No action navine been taken, the board was subsequently reconvened to de termine more fully the plans and estimates necessary for carrying out its recommenda tions. It has received information which indicates that there are responsible steel manufacturers in this country who, although not provided at present with the necessary xilant. are willine to construct it and to make bids for contracts with the eovernment for the supply of the requisite material for the heaviest elms adapted to modern warfare, if a guarantee order of sufficient magnitude, ac companied by a positive appropriation, ex tending over a series of years, shall be made hv noncrreas. All doubts as to the feasibility of the plan being thus removed, I renew my recommendation that such action be taken by Congress as will enable the government to COnStTUCS ICS Own urumauiw u iyiL yjux xjnii. i- i - ritory, and so to provide the armaments demanded by considerations of national safe ty and honor. Xlie Navy. The report of the Secretary of the Navy ex hibits the proeress which has been made on the new steel cruisers, authorized by the acts of August 5, 1882, and March 3, 1883. Of the four vessels under contract one, the Chi cago, of 4,500 tons, is more than half fin ished: the Atlanta, of 3,000 tons, has been gnccessfnlly lunncnea ana ner niacumerv now fitting. The Boston, also of 3,000 tons, is ready for launching, and the Dolphin, a dispatch steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for delivery. Certain adverse criticisms upon the designs of these cruisers are discussed by the Secretary , who insists that the correctness of the conclusions reached by the advisory board and by the department has been dem onstrated by recent developments in ship building abroad. The machinery or tne aouoie-wirreieu . . . X 1.3 monitors Puritan, Terror and Ampmtnte, contracted for nnder the act of March d 1883, is in process of construction. INo work; has been done duriner the past year on their armor f er lack of the necessary appropria tions. A fourth monitor, the Monadnock, still remains unfinished at thp navy yard in California. It is recommended that early steps be taken to complete these vessels and to provide also an armament for the monitor Miantonoman. 

MORE WAR VESSELS EECOMMENDED. The recommendations of the naval advis- sorv board, approved by the department. comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavily armed gunboats, one light cruising gunboat, one dispatch ves sel armed with llotcnxJSS cannon, one ar mored ram and three torpedo boats. The general designs, all of which are calculated to meet the exijstjng wants of the service, are now well advaneedV and the construction of the vessels can be undertaken aa soon as you, shall grant the necessary autnouty. The removal to tnis country or tne ueuu ot the Jeannette expedition and the Greely re lief expedition are detailed, and the conduct of the last expedition is nigmy commended. RESTORING THE NAVT. In this, the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the Oortoxess of the United States, I cannot too strongly urge on its attention the duty of re storing our navy as rapidly as possible to the high state of efficiency which formerly char acterized it. As the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturbed it is plain that tho policy of strengthening this arm of the ser vice is dictated by considerations of wise economy, of just reeard for our future tran quility end of true appreciation of the digni ty ana nonor ox tiu; reiuuiiu. The Postal Department. The loss of rpyenue from the reduction in the rate of letter postage, as recommended in my message of December. l8g, and ef fected by the act of March 2, 1883, has been much lees than; was generally anticipated. My recommendation or this reduction was based upon the belief that the actual falling off in receipts from letter postages for the year immediately succeeding the change of rate would be $3,000,000. It has proved to be only $3,27g,P90. This is a trustworthy indication mat the revaijue will soon be re stored to its former volume by the natural increase of sealed correspondence. " confi dently repeat, therefore, the recommendation of my last annual message that the single rata of postage upon drop lettess be "reduced to one cent wherever the payment of two cents is now feqnired by law. The doable rate is only exacted at ofiucs where the car rier system is in operation, and it appears that the increase in the tax upon local letters defrays the cost, net apy o V own collec tion and delivery, but of the ppllactipn and delivery of all other mail matters. This . Jg an inequality that ought no longer to exist. I approve the recommendation of the Post master General that the unit of weight in the ratjng of first-class matters should be one ounce, instead $f pne-half ounce as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the de partment it ma be yreji donbtd whether the change would result in any loss of reve nue. That it would greatly promote the convenience of the public is Btyond dispute. The free delivery system has been lately applied to five cities and the total number of offices in which it is now in operation is one hundred and fifty-nine. Experience shows that its adoption, under proper conanaona, in equally an accommodation to the public and an advantage to tne posiai noiv. more than self-sustaining, and, for the rea sons urged by the Postmaster General, may Ha ronfirlv extended. to provide means whereby exceptional dis patch in dealing with letters in free delivery n- t ,-1 v ft,.

Else IjStw Department. Th Attornev Ganeral renews the recom Ii,i,L.til,Ti rtnnfcniTied in his report of last year touching the - fees of witnesses and jurors. He favors radical changes in the fee bill, the adoption of a system by which at- torneys and marsnais oi iuo .-h.il Ha onTrmonsated solely by salaries, and tite erection bv the government oi a peniten tiary for the confinement of offenders against its laws. The Interior Department. Of tho vniHorl irovemmental concerns in charge of the Interior department, the report of its Secretary presents an interesting sum mary. Among the topics deserving particu lar attention I refer you to his observations rAanActincr onr Indian affairs, the pre-emption and timber culture acts, the failure of rail mA enmnaniea to take title to lands granted by the government and the operations of the pension office, the patent office, the census office and the bureau of education. THE INDIAN QUESTION. Alliiairtn lifts ben made already to the cir cumstance that both as between the different Tti linn trihoo anil Aft between the Indians .and the whites, the past year has been one of unbroken peace. In this circumstance me President is glad to find justification for the policy of the government in its dealing wh the Indian question, and ooiuiruiaiiuii views which were fully expressed in his first communication to the Forty-seventh Con s'??? .X.- l The secretary urges anew me ouihiutoui: ui a statute for the punishment of crime com mitted in the Indian reservation ana recom mends the passage of the bill now pending in the House of Representatives for the purchase of a tract ot 18,000 square miles from the Sioux reservation. Both these measures are worthy of approval. THE 

PACIFIC RAILROAD. I concur with him also in advising the re peal of the pre-emption law, the enactment of statutes resolving the present legal com plications touching land grants to railroad companies, and the funding of ' the debt of tho several Pacific railroads, under such guaranty as shall effectually make Bure its ultimate payment. Mormoalnn, The report of the Utah commission will be read with interest. It discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that territo ry. I still believe that, if that abominable practice can be suppressed by law, it can only be by the most radical fegislation con sistent with the restraints of the constitution. I again recommend, therefore, that Congress assume absolute political control of the Ter ritory of Utah and provide tor the appoint ment of commissioners with such government powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their hands. The Industrial Policy. In the course of this communication refer ence has more than once been made to the policy of this government as regards the ex tension of our foreign trade. It seems prop er to declare the general principles that should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this direction. The main condi tions of the problem mav be thus stated: We are a people in mechanical pursuits and fertile invention: we cover a vast extent oi territory rich in agricultural products and in nearly all the raw materials necessary for suc cessful manufacture; we have a system of productive establishment more than sumeient to supply our own needs; wages of labor are nowhere else so creatr the scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort, and the development of those higher moral ana intellectual qual ities that bo to tho makine of good citizens our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present needs ot the government. 

SEEKING NEW MARKETS. These are elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme bv which without unfa vorably chancrincr the condition of the work- ingmen our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new mar kets nrnvitlerl for the sale beyond our bor ders of the manifold rruits or our muusiriai enterprises. The problem is complex and can be solved by no single measure of inno vation or reform. The countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for the United States the natural marts of supply and demand. It is from them that "we should obtain what we do not pro duce or do not produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions cf our fields, flour mills and our workshops should flow under conditions that will equal ize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition. Four paths of policy seem to point to this end : RECIPROCAL COMMERCIAL TREATIES, First A series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries or America, which shall foster between us and them on unhampered movement of trade. The con ditions of these treaties should be free ad mission of snoh merchandise as this country does not produce, in return fcfr the admis sion free, or under a favorable scheme of duties, of our own products; the benefit of such exchange to apply only to goods oarried under the flag of the parties to the contract; the removal on both sides from the vessels so privileged of all tonnage dues and national import, so that their vessels may ply unhin dered between onr ports and those of the other contracting parties, though Without infrinedns on the reserved home-coasting trade; the removal or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those cettntries coming within the benefits of the treaties, and the avoidance of the technicalities, strictions and penalties by which our inter course with those countries is at present hampered. 

ABOLISHING CONSULAR FEES. Secondly The establishment of the consu lar service of the United States on a salaried footing, thus permitting the relinquishment of consular fees, not only as respects vessels under the national flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the. treaties. I1LPROVJNG a: UK MERCHANT MARINE, Thirdly The enactment of measnies to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United States. AN AMERICAN MONETARY UNION. Fourthly The establishment of a uniform currency basis for the countries of America, so that the products of our mines may cir culate on equal terms throughout the whole system of commonwealths. This would .re quire a monetary union of America, whereby the output of the bullion producing countries and the circulation of those which yield nei ther gold nor silver could be adjusted in con formity with the population, wealth and com mercial needs of each. " Aa many of the coun tries furnish no bullion to the common stock the surplus production of our mites might thus be utilized and a step taken toward the general remonetization of silver. To the accomplishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained by separate trea ties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed and the favor with which this enlarged policy has thus far been received warrants the belief that its operations will, ere long, embrace all, or nearly all, the countries pi tnis Hem isphere. REDUCE TAMFF BURDENS, It is by no means desirable, however, that the policy nnder consideration should be ap plied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa should be sougnt py reducing tar iff burdens on such of their wares as neither we nor the other American States are fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in return a oeiter rasntst ior wu sup plies of food, raw material and of the manu factures in which we excel. It seems to me that many of fhe embarrassing elements in the great national conflict between protection and free trade may thus' be turned to ' good account; that the revenue may be reduced, so as to no longer overtax the people; that protection duties may be retained with out becoming bwdenspme, that our ship ping interest may be judiciously eneonraged, the currency fixed on a firm basis"; and above ail that such an unity of interest be estab lished among the St4te of the American system as will be of great and ever increas ing Interest to them all. . All treaties in the name of this policy which have been negotiated or are in pro cess of negotiation contain a provision, deemed to be requisite nnder the clause of the constitution, miming mo uuun vi Representatives the authority to originate bills for raising revenue. The Civil Service. On the 29th of February last I transmitted to Congress the first annual report of tne civil service commission, together with com munications from the heads of the several executive departments of the government re specting the practical workings of the law under which the commission had been acting. The good results therein foreshadowed have been more than realized. The system has fully answered the expectations of its mends in securing competent and faithful public servants, and in protecting the appointing officers of the government from the pressure of personal importunity and rrom tne laoor of examinine- the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment. Th9 law has had the unqualified support or tne President and the heads of the several de partments, and the members of the commis sion have peitormea tneir dunes wim ieat and fidelitv. Their report will shortly be submitted and will be accompanied by snch recommendations for enlarging the scope or the existing statute as shall commend them selves to the executive ana . tne coinnnssiuu- era charged with its administration. Itliseellaneons. In view of the general and persistent de mand throughout the commercial community for a national bankrupt law, I hope that the differences of sentiment which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the present session. THE 

CHOLERA. The pestilence which f dr the past two years has been raging in the countries of the East recently made its appearance in European norts with which we are in constant commu nication. The then Secretary of the Trea sury, in pursuance of a proclamation of the pmairlnt- issued certain reeulations restrict ing, and for a time prohibiting', the importa tion of rags and the admission of baggage of immigrants and of travelers arriving from infected auarters. Lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law, I approve the recommendation of the recent becretary that Congress take action in the premises. and I also recommend tne immediate auw tion of such measures as will be likely to ward off the dreaded epidemic, and to miti gate its severity in case it shall unhappily ex tend to our shores. A PENSION FOR GRANT. I recommend that, in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant, late eeneral of the armies of the United States and twice President of the nation, Con gress confer upon him a suitable pension, SUGGESTIONS RENEWED. Certain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient I have now in obedi ence to the constitution recommended for your adoption. As respects others of no less importance I shall content myself with re newing the recommendations already made to Congress without restating the grounds upon which such recommendations were based. The preservation of forests on the rmhlic domain, the erantine of government i -, . - a, j t. r aid for popular education, tne ameiiuiueiii. ui the federal constitution so as to make effect ive the disapproval by the President of par ticular items in appropriation bills, the en actment of statutes in regard to tne niimg oi vacancies In the presidential office, and the determinining of vexed questions respecting presidential inability are measures which may justly receive your serious considera tion. 

THANKS. As the time draws nieh when I am to re tire from the public service I cannot refrain from expressing to the members of the na tional legislature, witn wnom nave ueen brought into personal and official intercourse, my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and of their harmonious co-operation with the executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation, and to my fellow citizens gene rally I acknowledge a deep sense of obliga tion for the support they nave acooraeo me in my administration of the executive de partment.

Tn the Palladium of this date Selectman Treat in an interview with a reporter of that paper says: "I proposed early in the year that a committee or tnree De appomiea. to make the purchases for the town. Mr. Rey nolds objected and regarded it as a personal attack upon himself. Messrs. Reynolds, English and Beecher were appointed a com mittee to draft a resolution to that effect pro- rtnaorl Mr. Reynolds refused to sisrn the resolution and it passed, and the result has been the purchase of meats, bread and gro ceries much less than ever before and a great saving to the town."

One of the marriages which occurred at Thankstrivine time was that of George Mun . . . ,, , . . - T -1 1 T son, jr., or isortn Jim ana juihh husu umic, of Guilford. On Thanksgiving evening there was a sur prise party at U. Dumond's which was throughly enjoyable. Music and dancing and a good supper made the hours fly all too fast and it was "the day after the fair" before any realized it. The mighty hunters were abroad in the land to celebrate Thanksgiving, there being nine in one company. A fox was started and ahnt, f.t but iust missed. Mr. and Mrs. Bethnel Brockett, of North Hill, celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of their mariace on Thankseivine day. Their children and families cathered at the .old homestead to help make the occasion a happy one. About thirty members of the Stiles and Heaton famiues went from this place to New Britain to keep Thanksgiving with their relative. Mrs. Merab Blakeslee. Miss Kittie Dowd, who has been enjoying a vacation of two weeks, Teturns to the school at Webster, Mass., this week. Miss Harriet Doolittle. of Wallinrford, spending some time in town with Mrs. Lucy Fowler. The work of replanking Mansfield's bridge is completed and will be appreciated by the townsneonle. The Rev. Mr. Dennison, of Middlefield, Tjreached two excellent sermons at the Con gregational chnreh on Sunday. Mr. Rey nolds preached in Middlefield. Mr. Denni son is very much liked by the North Haven people. He led the services at the evening meeting, which was a very good one,although there were not as many present as usual, probably on account of the slight rain early in the evening. The election of officers for the Sunday school of the Congregational church is to take place next Sunday noon immediately after the exercises of the Sunday school. The people at St. John's church have al ready commenced to practice -Christmas music. There was a rehearsal for that pur pose last evening. The ladies' euild will meet on Thursday afternoon at the house of Fraklin Sheperd in the Sixth district, and they will hold an oys ter supper at the same place on Thursday evening. uec. i.

Shorts In a Scramble A Sharp Rise In New York Central Hurries Them to Cover Other Leading Stocks Share In the " Rise Western Union Ad vance Sharply Better Prices All Around at the Close. New York, Dec. 1. Waw York Central was the feature ef the morning's dealings on the Stock . Ex- chango, exhibiting great activity and decid ed strength. The price of the stock at one time showedan advance of SJi per cent, over the closing of Saturday under a vigorous and heavy buying. The advance was unexpected and caused srreat consternation among the shorts, who scrambled to cover not only m Central, Dut in otn. ere of the leading stocks. Toward midday there was considerable realizing on the part of operators desirous of bagging the profits of the morning's advance and a sham reaction followed. "The strength of New York Central gave rise to consider" able comment. There was no news or change in the railroad war to warrant the rise and the con" elusion generally reached was that the price was washed up on fictitious transactions by the clique in it. The weak spot of the market was the coal shares, the prices of which declined to 1-6 to 1 per cent., on the non-payment of the Jersey "Cen tral dividend due to-day and an apparent determi nation on the part of Reading to go on mining and selling all it can regardless of the low prices. From 12:30 to 3 o'clock prices were irregular, but a firm undertone characterized the dealings. Trading was on a much smaller scale than during the morning and nothing: worthy of note transpired. In the final hour of business Western Union was the fea ture, advancing sharply on tne strengtn oi tne ae- ciinn of .Tudjre Wallace in the Bell telephone case. it being believed that the Western Union company ! is the largest holder in the Bell company. The ad- I vauce caused renewed buying of others on the list ! and at the close prices were within a fraction of the highest of the day. The specialties ware generally unchanged. The sales aggregated 320,000 shares. A . Money closed easy at 1 per cent. n'votiniio-A clniwd weak ami lower.
