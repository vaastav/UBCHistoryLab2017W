The com mittee was in sesion almost two hours, and went over in detail the provisions of the convention. No votes were cast against it, but it was criticised very sharply by Senators Money and Bacon, who found in it many of the objections which they urged against the old treaty. They took especial exception to the provision continuing in force the neutrality provision of the Clay-ton-Bulwor treaty, and also made ob jection to the clause specifically au thorizing the United States to police the canal, as placing a limitation upon the power of this country to absolutely control it. Senator Frye presided over the meeting, and authorized Senator Lodge to report the treaty to the sen ate Monday in case there should be an executive session that day, It also was the BenBO of the committee that the consideration of the treaty should be pressed as speedily as pos sible in the senate, some senators ex pressing the hope that action might be Becured before the adjournment for the holidays.

FOUND SIDIBY SIDE Were Charred Bodies of Mother and Her Litth Daughter. ALL THE OTHERS WERE RESCUED. Frantic Father Had to Be Forcibly Curried From Ills liiirnlng Home When He Found His WIfo and Child Had Perished. Pittsburg, Dec. 0. Two persons were burned to death and seven In jured In a fire at Carnegie. The dead are: Mrs. Sarah Klee, 43, and Mary Klee, her 9-year-old daugh ter. The Injured are: Samuel Klee, 50, nnd children, Ida 20, Anna 17, Ra chel 14, Eva 10, Jenny 6, and Harry 4. The Klee residence was a two-story frame house on Broadway, the ground floor front being a grocery kept by Klee, and the rest of the house being occupied by the family. It was en tirely destroyed. The fire was discovered by Norrls Flzls, grocery clerk, who immediately gave the alarm, but the flames spread so rapidly the occupants of the upper story were shut off from the stairway. Klee and his wife realized there was but one way to save the children, and that was to throw them from the win dow, a distance of about 20 feet. One by one the children were brought to the window and dropped to the ground by the father. All of them were more or less seriously Injured, but all escaped death Jrom the flames except Mary. By the time Harry, the baby, was reached not only was the father exhausted, but the flames were fast making his efforts impossible. When he was able to get Harry It was found that the Are had already reached him and that the child's face and hands were blistered and burned. He was snatehed from the flames just in time, and it is thought he will survive. After rescuing his baby the father looked around for hjs wife, whom he had missed from his side for some time. Unable to locate her, he called to those whom he had saved for the purpose of ascertaining If she had Joined them. She had not, and the husband became almost distracted with fear and panic. It seems, how ever, that while the father was rescu ing the youngest and most helpless child she was making an attempt to save the life of Mary, and in doing so gave up her own life. The charred remains of the mother and daughter were found In the ruins side by side. Both had been overcome by smoke before they could escape from the room. When the firemen arrived the father refused to leave the building without his wife and child, and the firemen were compelled to forcibly .carry him from the burning building. Anti-Opium Crusade.

WHAT LABORERS WAHT Wide Scope of Resolutions Offered at A. F. L. Convention. A PROTEST AGAINST INJUNCTIONS.

In the tem porary absence of President Gompers, First Vice President Duncan of Bos ton, presided at Friday's session of tho American Federation of Labor. There are several contests over the seating of delegates yet undecided. One of the most Important is brought by Francis S. DIspagna of the Mosaic Workers' union against the seating of D. S. Wood, president of the Ceramic, Mosaic and Encaustic Tile Workers' International union. Dispagna's fight against President Wood Is not person al, but over the question of jurisdic tion In laying ceramic tiles. The Mo saic Workers' union claims tho sole right to lay such material. The cre dentials committee Is trying to or range all disputes amicably, so as to avoid any friction In the convention. The resolutions introduced number 60. They cover many questions af fecting the laboring men. Four of them demand the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion act, one commends President Roosevelt for the position he took In his message with reference to the Chinese question, and a large number call for strict trade autonomy. Max Hayes of Cleveland Introduced a resolution providing for the admit tance of miners under IS years of age Into unions at a reduced per capita tax. Delegate Dietrich of Washington, D C, presented a resolution protesting against subsidy legislation by con gress; another resolution called for the appointment of a committee of five to draft a memorial to congress to pro hibit the gi anting of Injunctions by courts against oiganlzed labor. Other resolutions provided for universal la bels; for boycotts against concerns lo cated In various parts of the country; giving seamen the full right to quit any merchant vessel on which the ser vice has been obnoxious to him. After the resolutions were referred to the proper committees a recess was taken until the arrival of Edward F McSweeney, deputy commissioner of Immigration at the port of New York, who addressed the delegates. He re viewed the history of Immigration from the downfall of the Roman empire to the present time, and then explained, the method of enforcing the immigra tion laws. The spirit of the law," her said, "Is being violated by the whole sale." He recalled the railroad wreck In Michigan last week, In which a large number of immigrants were killed, and asserted that those Immigrants were no doubt under contract to work In California, to which state they were en route when their lives were crush ed out. Speaking of the Chinese ex clusion act. Mr. McSweeney said the Japanese should also be excluded from the United States because they are more undesirable than the Chinamen. In conclusion he said that the immi gration laws should be revised and reconstructed fr,om the beginning by experts. All the pending legislation before congress to remedy the present evils will make only more confusion. Labor contractors, said he. are each year perfecting their method for the bringing of aiiens Into this country, and the powers of he bureau of immi gration are not being extended.
