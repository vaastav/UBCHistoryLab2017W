Nervousuess, Insanity, Insomnia, Indigestion, Fevers of various kinds, all kinds of disease relative to sex, low vitality, Appendi citis, Constipation and others too num erous to mention. I especially invite those who suffer with constipation, and ladies wbo Buffer with disease Ja'cu lLar to them to come and let me make them well; for Chiro practic will do it where all else falls. You need not submit to local examina tion, cie., for my work Is principally on the spine. 1 locate and remove the CAUSE of your trouble. Come today; do not witlt. The various symptoms or outward expressions of disease, are nature's warnings and must not be ignored. No douldil you have heard of Chiropractic, and perhaps, have heard sorao one "knocking" the profession; but, we find "knockers" who knock at everything and everybody, so do not listen, but come and see for yourself. H will only take a few minutes' ex planation to convince you that I know what I am talking about. If you are in doubt, come and be examined. Ke member, it costs you nothing to inves tigate. . I understand that there has been one or two "pseudo" Chiropractors here, but an individual who is a "pseudo" in any profession is unprinci pled and no surprise can be manifested at their conduct, but I request the people of Chlekasha and vicinity as broa vmlnded people not tii associate them, or connect them in anyway to the profession of Chiropractic, there by becoming prejudiced and depriving yourself and frier of something as indispensable to every community as is the science of Chiropractic.
