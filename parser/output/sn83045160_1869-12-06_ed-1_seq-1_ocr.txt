THE MEMPHIS DAILY APPEAL. ESTABLISHED 1840. MEMPHIS, TEISTJST., MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1869, VOL. 30 -ISTO. 96 i I THE NEWS. Henry Ward Beeohersays (iod is as wise as he is. Ilow humble and rt rer eni he must be! Probably not more than MM votes have been polled in the entire State ot Mississippi against the new consti tution. (July Goo were east against it n Vicksburj. Dick Busteed, the dirty dog and carpet-bagger who disgraced the judi ciary of Alabama, is to be impeached by Congress for high crimes and mis demeanors. Served him right. Jen. Clanton recently thrashed Mc Kinstry, who used to bo Bruin's Pro vost Marshal at Atlanta. McK. has become a negro-suffrage Radical, and is kicked out ot decent society by t lantou. Hon. C. C. Langdon, an erudite scholar and elegant gentleman, and, withal, a farmer ami .statesman, de livered a magnifii-ent oration last Tuesday at the Alabama State Fair at Moutgomery. The gross receipts of the Cherokee, (ieorgia and Alabama Fair, at Rome, i reported at M?M; disbursements. $4-". !'.; balance on hand, $11 N" iH. A dividend M twenty per cent been declared on shares. A man named Fisk is probably . ! ted ti Congress from the Yiek burg district. Our Mississippi ex change contained, yesterday, mesiger news about the election in that State. All of them deplore the indifference manilested by white people. One of the Cuban Junta, of New York, denies the late story about the contemplated treachery of Gen. Jor lan. He say Jordan was promoted to the jst of Chief of Staff, aud is held in high esteem by the Cubans, who have implicit confidence in him. The .piesticn of the removal of the p;iidtothet is ling revuvt d in Washington. A Wfiniltfl Senator is preparmg a speech on the subject, and was heard to remark that m, Wi-tern man can afford to vote against the removal and hope to go back to Congress The Alabama Legislature is engaged in expelling Democratic members and substituting knaves and thieves. Mobile, it Ls thought, will be de prived of its-present local government and turned over to the tender mer cies of such fellows as used to plunder this city and county. The Tribune intimates that the city will be made too hot to hold its appointed masters. Our public debt is now a little over i Jc2.lt00,to,t0. Ctereland (O.) leader. To which the Louisville Iburitr- Journal says: The "little over" the jAf.der talks about is only six hundred and forty-nine millions, six hundred j and lifty-i'mr thousand, seven hun- ' dred and forty-four dollars and twen- ty-six cent an amount ten times i p greater than the entire indebtedness of the government before it fell into the hand- af the Republican party. The rier retary of the Navy, in his report to be Udd !efore Congress. next ! week, rev. 'in menus the establishment of a navy-yard at Port Royal, S. C. A better selection could not have been made on the South Atlantic coast, as the depth of water on the bar, her j . magnificent bay and her rapidly ex- tending railroad connections make ! Port Royal a most desirable and con venieot port for shipbuilding and re airs. The Presbyterian Banner of this week say-: i he letter ot the two tien-t-ral Aemblies of th- Proafavtcrhm Church, lately reunited in this city, b -om mended by the t 'athollc World as i sii courteuiis, tempi rate and fair, that it deserves to dime under the settee j of the Pupe and his Council; ami the editor suggest that it lie sent, in Kng- i lih and in Latin, to Pope Pius. An official copy is accordingly to be for-1 warded to Rome, in both languages, with the signatures of the two Moder- ; ators. The Louisville Courier-Journal of j Saturday, says ofthe mass-meeting j held iu that city on Friday, to consid- r a direct route to Chattauooga, that it was a monster affair. In point of nuiiihers and enthusiasm, it has never been surpassed ty a:iy railroad meet- , inc of recent titms. The wealth and MMcle of the city were represented in m juost conspicuous manner. The -jieakers were thoroughly representa tive men. The interest was, from firt to last, unbruken and intense; and 1 then rosea universal and sontanei. u-respond-te ir.

Tradition handeil dou :i from age- to age in the Univer sity of Alabama toid the writer of this, when an undergraduate, that Mr. Smith's compositions and speeches, when he wrole as a collegian, were rxer versified. Mr. Smith is the first Southerner who has undertaken the i.i -k, to which he has devoted his leisure hours for twenty years, and we would fain hope tliat the work will MH creditable to the author aud tne Stale of which he liecomes, now tnat Aleck Meek is no more, the literary representative. Many of the Northern papers iwb-li-h in full the manly and patriotic addresn of Qaeu Hampton, at our State Fair, end all -peak ot it in the highest praise.

A Radical organ says: "Politics which, six yirs ago, for u brief and lii.ii.ily -iiaci-, liuctuated on the fields mt war, now movus from the forum to the market.

The fashion for fulf drenb suits this season is d coatol blue cloth, w ith gilt iiuttons, puDtttioous and vest of black cassiuic'res with inside vest of white citk.

In forecasting the business of the coming sessiu of Congress, the New York Herald says: "The army is likelv to get another blow from the military failures w ho have managed to get into Congress, and have proved a.- much of an eiubarrasrueut to Con gress as tta-v were to the army. These disinterested patriots seem to take par ticular delight in attacking the army, as if that gallant and credible arm f the government was responsible for ,-n lUilK-ciiity anu uepioraoie sue.."

MEMPHIS ABROAD. The Short-Sightedness of the People by a St. Louis Joanul. What We Were, Are. a-d are Doilg. by a Corresnondent. The Ht. Louis Tim) of Friday says: Geo. P. Plant, Eq., President of the Merchants' Exchange, has addressed a letter to I:i j. M. J. Wicks, Presi dent of the M"tn'hl and Charleston Railroad, stating su.-einotly and in a business-like way, the importance of cheaper and improved facilities for the transfer of freight from the boats of the packet company to the cars at Memphis. This is a matter to w hich wo have frequently adverted, and shall con tinue strenuously to advocate, until the imcrative needs referred to are fully Ml A proposition and an admirable one it was for the establishment ot a union depot at some accessible point upon the Memphis levee, was recently introduced in the Common Council oi that city, in the form of a petition from Mr. Wicks, of the Charlesioti Road, and Capt. H. W. Smith, of the hasM'acket Companv. asking the right of way through the city and the requisite privileges upon the landing; but, strange to say, it was given the very coldest shoulder ol tliat municipal body, and disused of in a manner certainly more summary than wise. This singular action of the Memphis City Council seems furthermere to have been approved, if not dictated, by the local pre-vs, and many of the prominent business men of the town, who certainly tand much in their own liirlit in this narrow and con tracted policy. We can appreciate, of course, the unwillingness of our Memphis friends Q. M a distributing point am ; route of trade between St. Lqu d the interi(,r ,south ,,ut tllc. LNe business men of that city very k h , th d )(jr ...,. .:7iotSnn. ! gtand hl thj f m enter prise, aud that all efforts to blockade, bv exhorbitant and ruinous transfer charges, the natural channels of trade, musyof necessity prove injuri ous in the end to the city or the indi viduals who thus assume to thwart and embarrass the economic transpor tation of Southern freights. The great river that washes the levee at Memphis should teach her citizens the striking resemblance be tween the laws of nature aud the equally inexorable laws of commerce. Wherever the current of this mighty stream comes iu contact with any ob stacle to its progress, if it does not force its way through, as its natural tendency i, go around, it must, and invariably does. So with the current of trade. It is impossible to dam it up. Its courso is not to be checked by city councils or aldermunic wisdom; and Meiuphi- or a;;y other city attempting to restrain it, 'will Ik? circumvet.ltd at the last, if not altogether ignored. The ira ic oi St. Louis with the South, already of immense proportion--, is daily increasing, and must continue to increase. It must, of! course, tir.d its way to the interior of the Southern States by the cheat -: and most hejihle route. It cannot afford to pay extoriionate tribute to Memphis, and unle-s the people of that citv exercise a more liberal and ' magnanimous spirit they must, sooner : or later lo-e every advantage pertain- i , ing tp. their port as a point of com mercial traiiiiipment. There are other routes South, which must aud ill be adopted by our mer. , chants, unless our friends at Memphis i accept the inevitable situation, aud by . business-like legislation, make that city as they may, the permanent dis tributive point ot our vast and in- : ' creasing trade. j The impositions now placed ujxin ; ou.r shippers are no longer endurable. : While the cost of transfer at Cairo. ; from rail to boat, is but two-aud-a-i half cents per hundred pounds on pro duce, aud tive cents on merchandise; while at Columbus, under eOHflnot with Mr. Halliday, it costs but five cents a hundred to transfer from the river to toe Memphis and Ohio road, the average expense of moving freight from the .Memphis landing to the cars Ls fully twelve cents a hundred, and frequently rlaei to fifteen cents, or three to four times the cost ol tran shipment at Cairo, Hickman or Co lumbus. The extraordinary expMMBBef the Packet company at" Memphis for the i single month of October, we are as sured, were $l0,0no for the single item of labor, when, with proper depot fa cilities and the requisite tramways, the whole bill could be tooted tor not to exceed $:i,ooo. The cost, in fact, of transhipment at Mtmpiiis is now fully equal to the freightage h nv to Cairo, by river, or from Menipius i :ila.nil a hundred miles by rail. This condition of things must be ! revoliitUHii'. d. The people of Mem-i phis have it in their pom to do it, or by negkvtintr the opportunity, to lose altogether the great commercial im portance which is by nature theirs. Believing that our readers would iike to see our city as others see it, we 1 present the following from a letter by a correspondent of the BJejMMi City lime, who wrote from Memphis a few days agi I : Memphis, some two years ago, had j a population of over 6O,(00. Its reverse.- lasy slid to have commenced at that time. High rents Were con tinued aud exacted as during the war. One to two hundred jer cent, were obtained for goods which absorbed the resources of the farming commu nity. PMWfli and plunder were re- 1 sorted to; legions of negroes were brought from th country tot the pur pose of voting their assumed benefac tors into office; the white m Jn tor want of sutlicient labor or uo lalior at all became demoralised; murder and burglary were familiar items on the iKjlice register; through the tmbecntty - , t of the law officers, artly from the in Huen of urtvi-dt-nts, but more from trrnr of thp HSS-sili's llUlll-t. lll(.t of those criminals were permitted to go unpunished. A respectable jury was a sight of rare occurrence. Seve ral thousands of g'iod, peaceable citi zens left b-re and one-third of the nier chants were forced into bankruptcy. The balance have hoped on from one season toanother. Business is not pros perous in .Memphis.

There has not been half a dozen buildings put up in two years. Ev erything is imported here, except the one single, solitary product cotton. Most of the plantations have been worked os hares by the negroes, and it is interesting t see with what nice feelings ot consideration and sympa thy the wholesale merchant or cotton factor approecbea te darkey w ith Ms one or two bales on his ox cart.
