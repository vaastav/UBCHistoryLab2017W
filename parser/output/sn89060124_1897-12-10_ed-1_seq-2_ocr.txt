The Washington /W, in its issue of December 3i\l, suggests to Senator Gor man that lie should consent to be a candidate for Congress from the nth Maryland District. It considers this his great opportunity to remain in public life, if he has the desire; and surely this part of Maryland would be honored in its Representative, should Mr. Gorman be elected. The Post says: “Will Air. Gorman consent to become a candidate for Congress in his own district next fall ? If so, the way would seem clear to bis deration to the high and res ponsible office of Speaker of the House. His district, although now represented by a Republican, is naturally democratic, and if he were the candidate, would undoubt edly give him a handsome majority. His position in the House would not be a mat ter of question; He would be the Demo cratic leader. Since the death of Speaker Crisp there has been no one on the Demo cratic side of the House possessing all the qualifications of undisputed control. The party has wandered in detached squads, lacking discipline and unity of purpose. Air. Gorman’s superior claims would be at once recognized, and his selection for the Speakership would he a matter of ac clamation, No one in the House could for a moment contest the honor with him. To the discharge of his duties he would bring his natural equipoise, his clear vis ion, his long parliamentary experience, his tact and wisdom, his accurate judg ment. A partisan in politics, he would nevertheless display as Speaker those broad characteristics which have made him a citizen above party.” THOSE ERECTION CONTESTS. We referred briefly hist week to llie contest which Capt. Gordon lias insti tuted for a seat in the State Senate. He lias been turned down by the peo ple, but lie seems unable to realize that elections mean something and when a candidate is defeated at the polls that that should be the end of it. I f Captain Gordon cannot understand why be was beaten, be should refresh his memory in some of our recent local political history. Ho was not regularly nomi nated by his party, at least he was not the choice of the convention which claimed to represent the organization. He was put upon the ticket to promote harmony as it was thought, and in or der to make place for him the regular nominee, who was a native-born citizen and a very worthy young gentleman, was compelled to stand aside by the bosses. Such an astute politician, as Capt. Gordon appears to be, should have realized that defeat stared him in the face from that day. The harmony which the Republicans expected to produce was only on the surface. The good people of Prince George’s pre ferred one of their native-born citizens to a stranger from another state, an ex-Army officer, who had acquired citi zenship here only a few years previous to his entry into the political arena. The result was perfectly natural. The contest of Mr. Rollins for Air. White’s seat in the House of Delegates, notice of w Inch was given since out last issue, is somewhat analogous. It is true that he was one of the nominees of the regular convention, but be was overwhelmed, as were some others of his associates on the ticket, by the title of popular discontent at the manner in which Hie Republicans managed things here in the last campaign. Mr. Fisher in deciding not to make a contest tacitly admits the fairness of the election, and robs the case of the contestants of any moral support that they might hope to excite even among partisans. The sentiment of Republi cans from all parts of the county, as expressed here on Tuesday, shows that these contests are looked upon with disfavor. The people of this county, irrespective of part}*, will not counte nance a movement w hich can result in good to nobody except ambitious poli ticians. The election has already cost enough, and the people arc tired of frivolous contest**. The contest for the presidency of the State Senate assumed a new phase on Wednesday, when it was reported that the Eastern Shore combination, in that regard at least, had “gone to pieces,"’ owing to the well-known fact that Sen ator Charles T. Wcstcott of Kent county had refused to join tlie other Republican members from across the bay, would refuse to vote for Mr. Dry don for president of the Senate, and would also decline to vote for Dr. Isaac A. Barber for successor to Senator Gorman. It was also rumored that Postmaster-General Gary bad advised his adherents in the State Senate not to vote for Air. Dryden for President of that body, but to vote for Air. Wcst cott notwithstanding the fact that the Kent county Senator has declined to boa candidate for the place. Should these reports prove correct, it would probably mean the withdrawal of the votes of Senators Wilkinson of St. Alary’s, Day o( Howard, and Marsh of Calvert, from the list of those on whom I lie Somerset county Senator relies for his election, and res lit in the choice of some other man tor the place. The Court of Appeals lias taken a recess until the first Alondav in Jaon- THE 

PKKSIDENT'S M KSSACJK. While the President's annual message contains a great deal of that “information of the state of the Union" which the Con stitution directs him, from time to time, to give to the Congress, the greater part of it is rightly devoted to the two subjects of most conspicuous importance, the currency and Cuba. The President assumes that the tariff act of the present Congress will ultimately produce a revenue sufficient for the needs of the government. At all events, it is proper to give it a fair trial, and as there is a sufficient balance now in the Treasury to meet a considerable deficiency, he re commends no further revenue legislation at this time. But the currency demands attention and he urges the importance of wise legislation now, while it is possible, in order to avoid a recurrence of the dan gerous conditions of four years ago. He points out very clearly how costly the present irredeemable currency is and how true economy as well as safety re quires an intelligent reform. This por tion of the message is well considered and forcible, and while the President's imme diate recommendations are few and sim ple, they are in accord with sound princi ples of currency reform and in support of the more detailed recommendations to be expected from the Secretary of the Treas ury. The essential point he particularly urges is that the United States notes, or greenbacks, when redeemed in gold, shall be held in the Treasury and paid out again only in exchange for gold. This would put an end to the costly and perilous “end less chain," and the justice and common sense of such a rule arc so obvious that it ought to be possible to secuic from Con gress at least this measure of currency re form, if not also those which look to the extension of banking facilities in sections now deprived of them by obsolete regula tions. Having given his views on this most impelativc subject and before proceeding to other domestic concerns, the President devotes by much the longest chapter of his message to the situation in Cuba. This chapter is, in effect, a rehearsal of the most recent diplomatic history and a state ment of the present attitude of the United States toward Spain and toward the Cu ban insurrection. The President regards what may be called the international situ ation as identical with that existing in Grant’s administration during the ten years’ war, and he quotes at length from General Grant’s message on the subject in expounding Ins view of the duty of the United States, particularly' with regard to the question of belligerent rights. The re cent change in the Spanish Ministry has brought about a change of Cuban policy, and in view of its conciliatory attitude and its apparently sincere promises, the President thinks the United States should refrain from immediate action, while main taining the firm and watchful position in which this government has not faltered. It is unlikely that this portion of the mes sage will give satisfaction to the friends of Cuba, either in Congress or without, but it is no part of the present purpose to discuss the matter here. There is a little bit of special pleading in behalf of the annexation of Hawaii that is not convincing and is somewhat at is sue with principles elsewhere laid down, and there is a kindly' mention of the Bi metallic Commission, as though it still had a prospect of accomplishing something, which is evidently designed only to avoid offending the silverites. Nobody knows better than Mr. McKinley the futility of this dream and that our own financial se curity would be better served by closing the profitless and disturbing discussion. The remainder of the message includes a brief survey of various administrative matters that require no particular mention here. It indicates a clear understanding of many complex subjects that come be fore the Executive, and its recommenda tions are generally' sound and interesting. The paragraph on the civil service is evi dently' sincere and shows no sign of sur render to the demoralizing influence of the spoilsman. Finally, the message ends with the significant sentence that “it is a commanding duty to keep the appropria tions within the receipts of the govern ment and thus avoid a deficit." This is the real secret of the "deficit" — not insufficient revenues, but excessive ap propriations. And it is by restraining the expenses of the government within the limits of probable revenues, instead of reaching out over land and sea for new fields of expenditure, that the deficit is to be avoided. The President has thus given to the Congress, on all domestic affairs at least, a good chart by which to steer. — Philadelphia Times SI 

LI*HIK AND DIPHT if EKI A. A subscriber sends the Sun the follow ing, taken from the Wilms*, of Belfast, Ireland, some years ago. It is of interest at this time in view of the prevalence of dlptheria Baltimore. “Should you or any of your family be attacked with diphtheria," states the arti cle, “be not alarmed, as it is easily and speedily cured without a doctor. When it was raging in Europe a few weeks ago I accompanied Dr. Field on his rounds to witness the so-called ‘wonderful cures’ he performed, while the patients of others were dropping on all sides. The remedy to be rapid must be simple. All he took with him was powder of sulphur and a quill, and with these he cured every pa tient without exception. He put a spoon ful of flour of brimstone into a wineglass of water and stirred it with his finer, in stead of a spoon, as the sulphur does not readily amalgamate with water. When the sulphur mixed he gave it as a gargle, and in ten minutes the patient was out of danger. Brimstone kills every species of fungus in man, beast and plant in a few minutes. In extreme cases, in which he has been called just in nick of lime, when the fungus was too nearly closed to allow the gargling, he blew the sulphur through a quill into the throat, and after the fun gus had shrunk to allow of it, then the gargling. He never lost a patient of diph theria. “If a patient cannot gargle, take a live conic, put it on a shovel and sprinkle a spoonful or two of flour of brimstone at a time upon it, let the sufferer inhale it and the fungus will die. If plenti fully used, the whole roi in may be filled to suffocation; the patient can walk about in it, inhaling the fumes with the doors and windows shut. The mode of fumi gating a room with sulphur has often cured most violent attacks of cold in the iiead, chest, Ac.,at any time, and is recom mmended incases of consumption and asthma. ’’-— It illiuion Sun.

WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington. I). ('.. December 6:li. Alu. Editoi:—Democrats and populists are not behind the republicans in joining iu the general sympathy extended to Air. McKinley because of the great sorrow which bus come upon him through the dy ing agonies of his mother. For the time, the strong opposition to the recommendations of his annual message is held in obeyance < and the criticism to which the message is open remains unspoken. In the presence of the angel of Death, as it were, any dis play of partisanship vonld be unseemly. The opening of the session of Congress was, owing to the circumstances, quieter than usual, although the crowds were there as usual. There were numerous empty seats in both House and Senate, al though the attendance was, on the whole, about up to the average of opening days. Senator Daniel was warmly congratu lated by his colleagues on his unanimous rcuomination by the democratic caucus of the Virginia legislature. Because it lumpens that all of the out spoken opponents of the annexation of Hawaii in the Senate are democrats it has been stated that party lines arc to be strictly drawn in the discussion of the treaty, and that a democratic caucus is likely to he held for the purpose of de claring against annexation. There is no disposition on the part of those democratic Senators who are opposing the ratification of the treaty, to make it a party question, although they will do all they can to de feat the treaty. This ought to be apparent to all when Senator Morgan, of Alabama, a democrat of the rock-ribbed kind, is one of the foremost advocates of the ratifica tion of the treaty. While the advocates of annexation are just as confident as ever that it will be accomplished, not a few of them express doubts of the ratification of the treaty, and believe that it will have to he d:nc by joint action of Congress. Representative Allen, of Alississippi, who enjoys the reputation of being the wittiest man in the House says; “Down iu in Mississippi, we have not, as yet, been deluged with prosperity. The advance agent is tarrying a long time on his way to our section. Tupelo (Air. Allen’s town) is waiting for him and will give him a brass band reception. Our people, how ever, arc not suffering for the necessities of life. AVc live modestly and contented ly, and are long on hog and hominy, how ever short we mav be on filthy lucre. We do not go much on clipping coupons, but as the poet well says, ‘We arc the people.’ " Senator AlcLaurin, of South Carolina, is opposed to the Postal Savings Bank scheme, unless material changes are made, because he thinks it would impose hard ships on owners of real estate, especially farm lands. He says that the National Banks having no legal right to make loans on real estate, the private and savings hanks are the principal sources from which such loans arc necessarily obtained, and that the operation of the Postal Savings Banks would drive all the idle money into the United States Treasury and the Na tional Banks, leaving no place where land owners could borrow money. If the scheme be amended so that the money de posited in the Postal Savings Bank can be loaned to land owners. Senator McLaurin will gladly support it. It is a real pleasure to he able to give tills administration credit for so commend able an action as the official action of the Post Office Department, closing the mails to all newspapers that print advertise ments offering chances in any disguised lottery scheme, such as missing letter words, guessing, etc. These swindles have been shown up almost as often as the green goods business, but so long as tbcj’ could advertise they could always find new • victims. Although it is perfectly clear that a large majority of the House are just as strongly in favor of adopting the AI organ resolution for the recognition of the bel ligerency of the Cubans, whi, Ii was adopt ed by the Senate at the extra session, as they were at the extra session, it is equal ly clear that they will not do it. Czar Reed and his lieutenants agree with the McKinley policy of waiting and will not give the House the opportunity to vote upon the Alorgau or any other Cuban reso lution. Thus, the country is shown how mistaken it has hcen in supposing that, under our government, the majority rules, in either or both branches of Congress. The majority rules all light, when allowed to vote, but voting is only done in the House by Czar Reed’s permission, and in the Senate voting is only done when the minority consents. The fight against Air. McKenna lies probably already caused Air. McKinley to regret having promised to nominate l.i.n to the United States Supreme Court. It’s growing quite hot, and the end is not yet. GOOD-ROADS 310 V LAI ENT. The movement for a better system of roads was given a decided impetus at the meeting of the Vansville Farmers’ Club, held at “The Pines," the home of Air. F. AI. Alagruder, near Beltsvillc, Saturday night. As a result of this meeting the club appointed a committee, composed of Col. AV. S. Powell, of Annapolis Junction; C. 11. Stanley, of Laurel, and 1). Al. Xesbit, of College Park, with power to communi cate with every farmers’ club and agricul tural society iu the State for the purpose of getting representatives from each to attend the Legislature to urge legislation on this subject. Beltsvillc Grange on Tuesday evening also took similar action, and then the wheelmen of the State will be asked to co-operate. Thus, with the combined efforts of the farmers and wheelmen, it is believed that the Legislature will he com pelled to recognize the appeal. Gen. Roy Stone, director of road in quiry, United States Department of Agri culture, who is one of the leading authori ties on the subject in this country, was a guest of the club, and made an excellent address, covering in detail the various features of road construction. I.oca! or ganizations to look after the roads in par ticular sections were recommended. Speaking of convict labor, the General said that the convicts should he employed in preparing the material, and the State should, under competent engineers, have charge of the construction of the roads. A change iu the administration of roads was sorely needed. General Stone advocated the establish ment of postal savings banks in the coun ties, the money deposited to he invested in county bonds for the improvement of roads and bearing a low rate of interest, say 11 per cent., these bonds to he guar anteed bv the State. There is #559,(190,000 of the people's money in Great Britain in" vested in this maimer. After partaking of a igpsut, grayed by the presence of Airs. Fillmore Beall, Airs. Alagrnder, the Alisses Sarah, Bell and Mol lie Alagruder and Aliss Graham, the sec rctarv read an interesting letter from Col. W. S. Powell, of Annapolis Junction. Colonel Powell said that the roads of the Slate should be built by convicts. There is not a month in the year that work can not be done on the roads. The question of the control of the convicts is a simple one. a law empowering institutions in which convicts have been committed al lowing them to transfer i hem to the care of county sheriffs for employment on the public roads will cover the whole system of control, because the sheriffs have a right to appoint as many deputies as is necessary. A system of 500 miles of road would practically open up every county and give highways to all central or dis tributing points by following this route— stalling at a line on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, in the boundary between Mary land and Virginia in AVorcester county op posite Franklin, Va., and going to Princess Anne, Somerset county, then to New Alar ket, Dorchester county; Federalsburg, Caroline county; Cordova, Talbot county; Centrcville, Queen Anne’s county; Mas sey’s, Kent county; Elkton, Cecil county —you take in practically the whole of the Eastern Shore. For Northern Maryland, from Elkton to Belair, to Cockeysville, Baltimore county, and thence to New Windsor, in Carroll county. For Western Maryland, to Frederick, to he intersected at this point hy road starting i.i SoLlaeru Maryland, at Leonardtown, St. Mary’s county, one branch to Prince Frederick, Calvert county; thence to Upper Marl boro’, Prince George’s county, and the other branch from Leonardtown to Port Tobacco, Charles c unty, and thence to Upper Marlboro’, to Annapolis. Ellicott City, Boyd Station, Alontgomery county, and thence to Frederick, from Frederick to Hageisti an, and from Hagerstown to Cumberland, via Hancock, and Cumber land to Oakland, Garrett county. This route would give each county about an equal number of miles of good roads and would also pass the territory not traversed by railroads. The Sb.te geologist states that suitable material can he obtained along tills route for tl.c roads. Roads should he divided into three divisions, one with a hard bed for heavy hauling, one with light bed for driving, with a well constructed sideway for bicycling. In conclusion Colonel Powell says: “I would not propose to build all this entire system of roads iu one year, but by building about 100 miles a year, within five years we would have a system of roads which, in connection with the steam and electric roads now existing, that would put us in the advance guard of the road development, and, I believe, the value of our farming laud would be increased fully 100 per cent." Of this system of roads mapped out by Co'onel lb, well, about 200 miles is already in iiie. There is a fine macadamized road from Baltimore through Hagerstown, Hancock, Cumberland and through a por tion of Garrett county. — Itallhnoic Sun. CALIFORNIA. America is a great country.
