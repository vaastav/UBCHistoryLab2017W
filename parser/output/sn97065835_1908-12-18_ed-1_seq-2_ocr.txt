Three geologists respectively es timate the age of Niagara Falls at 7,000 years, 39,000 years, and 150, 000 years. There are times when science seems to be pretty much the same as guessing. $ Taffs .plurality in California was 86,906. In California, Oregon and Washington the republican plural ity was over 150,000. The Pacific states are now more firmly repub lican than ever before. Special Agent Barr of the United States Treasury Department, testi fied Thursday in a preliminary hear ing of the government's suits against •the sugar trusts before Commission er Shields at New York, that fraud ulent scales were in use at the com pany's piers in Brooklyn, where raw sugar is weighed before being as sessed for duty. He produced pho tographs of these scales in which steel springs inserted in wooden platforms interfered with proper weighing. All Prance was greatly excited over the arrest of Mme. Steinheil on the 26th for the 'murder of her painter husband and stepmother in May last. She had just confessed that her various stories told the po lice were intended to conceal the real author of the crime, whom she .knew. Rumors had been rife that the examining judge, Leydett, had 'been Infatuated by the woman so that he tried to stifle the affair, while political opponents of the gov ernment tried to make capital of forcing an exposure of the scandal connected with the mysterious death of President Faure in 1899. Though hushed up at the time, it was known to those in power that Mme. Stein heil was with Faure when he died The question asked by some was "Did she poison Faure because he would not ask a revision of the Dreyfus trial?" In the office of ^Secretary of State Root, at Washington, recently, Iden tical notes were signed and exchang ed by Mr. Root and Ambassador Ta kahira, of Japan, explaining the at titude of their respective govern ments as to free commerce in the Far East, disclaiming any aggres sive intentions towards the posses sions of either country, defining the equal opportunity for each In the Chinese trade and pledging each other to the maintenance of 'the status quo in China. As the agree ment 1b not in the form of a treaty It is not deemed necessary to submit the notes to the action of the sen ate. In this respect it has been lik ened to the Monroe Doctrine In the history of the American continent. The organ of Premier Katsura in Toklo, the Kokumln, regards the declaration as tantamount to an of fensive and defensive alliance be tween Japan and the United States as the signatories become joint guardians of the peace in the Pacific. The news of this action has b^en welcomed generally in England. What was accomplished toward the construction of the big ditch acrow the American Isthmus during the last fiscal year is told with much detail in the report of the Canal Commission, Just published. It shows that the total cost of the can al to date, including the $29,000, 000 appropriated for the year 1909, 5 is $120,964,468. With an average of 43,067 workers on the pay roll, the death rate per thousand was 18 .32, less than half of the previous year the decrease was especially among the blacks, and this testifies to Improved sanitation. During the year 929 patients In the hospitals died out of 27,623 treated. Machin ery In use at the end of the year in cluded 101 isteam shovels, thirty American and French locomotives, 3461 American cars and 659 French cars, twenty cranes, thirty unload ere, nine 'track shifters, eighteen Pile drivers, .twenty-three earth apreaders and forty-six unloading ^kWfl. All the settlements were supplied with electric lights, num bering 13,365 sixteen candle lights. $ The United States Supreme court decided Monday, In the case of the Virginia railroads against the Vir ginia Railroad Commission that the rulings of the Commission fixing a jtwlfonm 2-cent rate for carrying passengers in the state is subject to review, thus- reversing the decision of the Federal Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The ground of the reversal Is the nar row one, however, that the appeal from the ruling of the commission should have been first to the Su preme court of Virginia before seek ing the intervention of the federal courts. The opinion which was. de livered by Justice. Holmes overruled the 'contention that the Circuit Court bad no Jurisdiction to re view the order of the commission and holds that the commission is actfnjr legislatively when it makes It, is Ordered that the bill 'be retained In the. (Circuit court tb ••e what wlllresult from an appeal to tlte, SUte Court of Appeals' Chief /jfaftiqjfi' SiflW and 'Justice Harlan Wfcije ^ncup«Bg jTli. the. reiult. dis- that the eontentlons of the commis- flPM-Cehsttg Bureau's nsRort:«n of marriage and divorce jMatca, which was su life yeur ago, rttti' *f0» itotffctirilkat out of 12,832,044 .marriages record ed in the twenty years from 1887 to 1906 there resulted 945,625 di vorces. Two-thirds of the divorces were obtained by wives, and deser tion forms the basis of over thirty eight per cent of all the divorces. The number of marriages reported annually increased from 483.069 in 1887 to 853,290 in 1906, but the rate of increase was by no means uni form, as only a very small increase occurred in 1893, the panic year, and it actually decreased the fol lowing year. The rate In 190G was ninety-three to 10,000 population, which means that about 3 per cent of the unmarried population gets married each year, in the last six years of the period the population increased ten per cent, but the di vorces increased twenty-nine per cent. Next to desertion the most common cause given for divorce is, for the men, adultery, and for the women, cruelty. Out of every six teen wives seeking divorce threa asked for alimony and two got it. Th« average duration of marriage terminated .by divorce was ten years and children were involved in forty percent of the total number of cases. -V- Another expedition in search oi treasure lost in the Spanish main in the days of the galleon and the free booter has come to grief. This time it was a party of five old Harvard men who blithely set forth in the former cup defender Mayflower, wltn divers and all the paraphernalia nec essary to penetrate the hold of a stiinken treasure ship and recover enough doubloons and bullion to place the gold reserve on an rmpreg nable basis. About the time the treasure seekers set sail It was re ported that a swarthy crew of Jolly Rogers who wore the blue of old Yale had chartered a low, rakish craft to trail the Mayflower. With cutlasses and pikes, and not forget ting the barrel of rum, these bold pirates planned to let the sons or Harvard perform the hard and dan gerous work of recovering the fab ulous treasure then a shot across the bows, boaders over Uie side with cutlasses in teeth, five wearers of the crimson walking the plank, scuttled Mayflower, and then a scoot to the fastnesses of some West In dian coral bay to divide the booty. But there will be no chance for the •amateur Captain Kiddis and Mar gans to carry out their part of tne joke it has been far from a joke with the original treasure seekers. A hurricane came up, and the May flower is now a dismantled derelict somewhere in the gulf stream, while the party of five, together with the seven members of the crew who were rescued from the battered bulk, to which they had clung for forty-eight hours, have been landed at the port of Baltimore by an unromantic Nor wegian tramip |steamer. Tlreasmre trove has a seemingly irresistible fascination for the adventurous. It also excites the cupidity of those who are not adventurous, and a pro moter, it was announced a few days ago, proposes to capitalize that fact by floating a million dollars of stock in a corporation, to recover about $50,000,000 worth of gold from a vessel that foundered some hundred years ago at a spot that has been exactly" located. Every school boy knows that the ghost of the lamented Captain Kidd stalks to protect his illgotten, hidden wealth, for which vain search has been made. Now, it's just as certain that the spooks of other free-booters and mariners who sailed the Spanish main are on guard. They resent the penetration of .their sentimental past in this day of steam and gasoline, except by the delvers of the pen, who find fiction's most thrilling field In that romantic era and they make the hurricanes blow as a warning to those who would disturb the mysteries of Davy Jones' locker. If you are not super stitious enough to believe it just ponder the net results of lost treas ure seeking in real life. The enrolliment of the three-year old baby, Pu Ye, as Emperer Hsuan Tung, of China, took place in the palace of Pekln Wednesday. Hun dreds of high officials took part in the ceremony, first kow towing to the tablets in memory of the late rulers and then to the imperial in fant. After this the mourning dress of the child was changed to one of a lighter hue embroidered with the imperial dragon. Thus arrayed, the toddling infant ascended the throne amid the playing of drums and the firing of crackers, he did this with out any helping hand, and from the throne bowed to his stepmother, the dowager empress, Ye Honaia. Then all the princes .bowed to the tiny emperor, after which he descended and was again clad in his dress of mourning. Then was issued the edict declaring the accession and granting amnesty to political prison ers. -4- It surprises the public to learn that tlie cost of the postal frank ing privilege last year was $42,000, 000, or more than twice the amount of the postal deficit. This leak de mands the prompt attention of con gress. Lllluokalani, the former queen of the Hawaiian Islands has arrived at Washington with retinue, to ask Congress for a grant of $200,000 that she may live as a royal person age should, her present income be ing only $4,000. With her came Prince Kalantanaole, the Hiwaiian delegate to Congress, and his prin cess wife Mr. Almoku, secretary of the queen, and her maid. The queen will appear in person before the house committee on claims, which has charge pit the bill intro duced at the last session to grant her $200,000 for crown lands in Ha will now vested in the United States. Uncle Sam. has struck a blow at a class of professional men peculiar to Washington. An order has been is sued prohibiting United States gov ernmet^,.clerks swelling their in »"^r 4 comes by practicing medicine or filling teeth on the side. It has for a long time been a common practice for department clerks to attend night colleges, and after securing diplo las, practice professions after their office hours. These so-called "sundown* doctors, dentists, lawyers, architects, etc., were able materially to increase their incomes. Protests were made by regular members of various professions, complaining, of the unfair competition of the "sun downers," who cut prices. This has resulted in an order prohibiting clerks from engaging in any outside business that requires their personal attention while in government em ploy. The annual report of Postmaster General Meyer discloses a deficit of $16,910,278, the largest in the his tory of the department, the increase in revenue having b'een only half the ordinary rate of recent years. The chief causes of the deficit is the large increase in the rural free de livery system, which cost $34,361, 4G3. The postmaster general re commends now a parcel post addi tion to the rural free delivery, be lieving that it would not only be a great benefit to the farmers, but would earn millions for the postal service. Furthermore, it is urged, that such a service would aid the small local stores. Says Mr. Meyer: "Were the postoffice department a modern business corporation, its board of directors would not hesi tate forty-eight hours to use the present 'machinery and establish a limited parcel post on the rural routes." He also renews his former recommendation for a postal sav ings bank on the plan of the bill now before the senate, and for the creation of the office of the direc tor of posts at a salary of $10,000 in order to command a business man of wide experience. This office would not change with every new ad ministration. $ One of the recommendations in President Roosevelt's message was that New Mexico aud Arizona be ad mitted to the union as separate states. The attempt to admit the territories as one state was defeated ly the actio.n of the people directly concerned, who preferred to bear the ills of territorial lcgislationTA the ills of territorial existence to statehood under the proposed con ditions. There have heretofore been several objections to the admittance of the two territories as separate states, some of which have been ma terial and others political. If it had not been for New Mexico's and Ariz ona's devotion to democracy, it is barely possible the other objections, chiefly sparcity of population and the large percentage of illiteracy among the Inhabitants, would have been overlooked. Now, with the re publican lead in congress assured, probably for several years, one of the objections is removed. Sooner or later congress will have to ad mit the two territories as separate states. It might as well do it now. The people of the two Dakotas, who fought so long for statehood, have a sympathetic feeling for the strug gles of New Mexico and Arizona, ajid Dakotans are not goi.ng to ob ject very strenuously, e.ven if two democratic states should be added to the union by the change. $ It would be a very good thing for Haytl, and for civilization, if the United States should respond to the intimations of foreign powers and take possession of the negro "repub lic," but it might very possibly not be a good thing for the United States itself. This country, what with teaching the Cubans how to rule themselves and the Filipinos the beneficence of a wise and humane government, has its hands full of the civilizing business without taking, on any more of the lesser people for its training. It may easily become necessary, however, for the United States to interfere if the attrocities in Hayti become too brutal, and if interference does come it should be on such terms that this country will have a free hand in the future in dealing with 'the obstreperous ne groes as they deserve. Since its first establishment eleven years ago, the rural free delivery mail service has grown .by leaps and bounds. Starting as an experiment, to gratify the hobby of one lpan, and with an appropriation of but a few thousand dollars, the service has in creased until during the last fiscal year the appropriation for this branch of the postal service was over $39,000,000. No one single agency has ever accomplished so much for the easement of conditions on the farm than the rural mail route, un less it be the rural telephone. With the two allies, the farmer's lot, and especially, the lot of the farmer's wife, has been rendered much pleas anter. The rural mail service should be extended as rapidly as possible. No niggardly policy in this respect will meet with the approval of the people, and fortunately congress and the postoffice department have quite generally .been in complete accord upon this question. The Brazilian ambassador struck the keynote of the future relations between the continents of North and South America when he told the riv ers and harbors congress .today that the Panama canal would unite in stead of separating the two contin ents. In time to come the two bodies will be united practically their whole lengths by railroads, and the Pana ma canal will be a great water high way used by all the nations of both continents. When the two Ameri cas area little farther along in their processes of development, the jeal ousy and fear of the United StateB which now prevails among some of the lesser nations will have disap peared and this country will occupy the position that is its right—that of a sort of elderly, and klndly disposed brother to the nations to the south. The report on population from the state census shows the necessity for a strong immigration propoganda under the auspices of the state. Suf ficient money should be provided to make it possible to make an ag gressive campaign during the next bienniura. The state should be able to employ the best press agent in America, and back him up with a business organization that could not fail in effectiveness. With the con ditions existing here and with a record of twelve remarkably produc tive seasons back of us there ought to be no difficulty in landing a hun dred thousand valuable and perma nent residents per year for the next five years. It can be done if the right sort of (lieu are put at it with a reasonable provision of funds. Oklahoma is now one of the dry est states in the union. On a refer endum to the people a law permit ing the sale of liquor for medicinal and scientific purposes was voted cut, at the election in November, and in accordance with the peoples' verdict Governor Haskell has for mally proclaimed the abolishment of the state dispensary system. Xo li quor can be legally had, therefore within the borders of the new state, and the prevailing drouth is so se vere that it is proposed to take steps to mitigate it somewhat when the legislature meets. The effort will lie in the direction of making it possible to purchase liquor for med icinal and scientific use. If it should succeed in attaining the ob ject sought we may expect Oklaho ma to begin producing scientists at an alarming rate or of developing diseases which require whisky for antedote. It might seem that the new Per sian council, authorized by the shah in lieu of that promised constitu tional form of government, repre sents a considerable step in the way of progress, for it is given out that it will be composed of 50 persons who will hold office for two years and who will have the right to pro pose, adopt and supervise the exe cution of new legislation. Also all concessions and loans are to coine before the council for approval or rejection before they can be sanc tioned by the shah, the council is to have control of the departments of government and no administrative official of the government or minister is to sit as a member of it. But here comes the joker. The council is to meet in the palace of the shah, and he is to have the power of ap pointing and dismissing its members. As showing how not to do it, the shah's plan promises success. $ On both sides of the Atlantic the new patent law which has gone into effect in Great Britain, after the ex piration of the year of grace, is re garded as of great industrial and commercial importance. Stripped of details, the new law provides that thenceforth all fo,reign patents in Great Britain may be revoked, after a reasonable time, unless the pat ented article is manufactured or the patented process operated in the United Kingdom to an adequate ex tent. It will be seen at once that this change is most radical. Here tofore the manufacturer, let us say, of an American harvesting machine, has been allowed to make it in the United States and send it over and sell it in England. His English pat ents protected him from British competitors, and the wages he paid in his factory were paid to Ameri cans. Hereafter, unless he would lose his patent, he must build an other factory In Great Britain, and there make a portion of his produi .. The inference is, of course that the wages in that factory will go to Englishmen. It is not difficult to see and sympathize with the British point of view. A patent is, of course, a legalized monopoly. The number of patents annually granted by Great Britain to foreigners is somewhat greater than the number of those granted to British citizens. Each patent not only confers a bene fit on .the owner of it, but by virtue of its being a monopoly it deprives others of that benefit. Moreover, many patents in America are used only as clubs. They are not oper ated, but serve merely to hold a special field away from competitors. Both France and Germany protect their citizens from this evil. In France a patent must be worked in two years, and in Germany in three years. It has seemed reasonable to Englishmen that their own people should share .more largely than they have done in the benefits which pat ents confer. The importance of the change may be judged by the esti mate of the head of a prominent firm of British shipbuilders that one hundred and twenty-five million dollars will be invested in Great Britain for the manufacture of ar ticles heretofore made abroad. About eight thousand patents come under the new law. TWO

D., Dec. 10.— Turning over, free of any incum brance whatever and in splendid condition, a property worth $60,000, W. 13. Sherrard, after sixteen years of service as superintendent of the Children's Home, last evening sur rendered active control of the home to A. D. Stuckeman. It was ex plained by Geo. Schlosser, president of the board, that Mr. Sherrard would remain as nominal superin tendent, but that the duties of the position would be performed in fact by Mr. Stuckeman. The latter and his wife have shown their capa bility for the work by valuable and generous services already perform ed. Tire announcement of this change was made at an oyster stew dinner given by Mr. Schlosser in honor of Mr. Sherrard to about twenty guests, immediately preceding the quarterly meeting of the board. Mr. Schlos ser spoke in appreciation of the long and successful work of Mr. Sherrard for the friendless or homeless chil dren of South Dakota and .stated that it was by his request that the board had consented to relieve him of responsibility for management of the home because of his advahced years. He will soon leave on an ex tended vacation. "We feel gratified by the Thanks giving collection of $300 in the busi ness district of Sioux Falls," said President Schlosser, "because it is a starter. Earl Pitcher and the as sistants he chose are to be given credit to raising over $2 00 of this amount in what was not the most promising part of the district can vassed. Acknowledgment was made to the Crowoc club for a gift of five dozen pieces of each kind of table silverware. Superintendent Sherrard's quar terly report showed that 32 children were received the first time, five for temporary care, 20 returned for replacement, 27 placed the first time, 16 replaced, 3 returned to par ents, one died and 38 were on hand December 1. Waterworks for Murdo. Murdo, S. D„ Dec. 12.—The city council has awarded the contract for installing the waterworks sys tem to the Des Moines Bridge and Iron Co. of Des Moines, Iowa. Accident With Nitro-GIycerine. On Tuesday morning an accident happened at the bridge car which is sidetracked here, that cost William Shell, foreman of the gang, a crip pled hand. A ibox which had been used to carry nitro-glycerine to the work on the bridge east of here was setting by the stove. It caught fire and as Mr. Shell was taking it out it exploded with such force as to T)reak six windows out of the car and badly lacerated Mr. SheePs hand. There was no appearance of the explosive about the box, and It is supposed that it had soaked into the wood and become crystallzed, which caused the explosion. Immediately after the accident Dr. Hargens was telegraphed for and came over from Hot Springs on the 8:30 train, tak ing Mr. Shell back with him. Two fingers from the hand had to be am putated, one being already blown off,—Buffalo Gap Republican. Keep your eye on Rapid City and watch Tike Union grow,.
