Bartlett, for whose safety fears were beginning to be f elt,as"she was several days over due, arrived at its destination last week with 45 shipwrecked sailors from the steamer Londonian, whom she had picked up at sea. Twenty-five others went down with their ship, i The Brockton, Mass. papers of last week contained long accounts of the vote on the license question in that city. Last year the city went for li cense by thirteen votes, and after living under the law for the past year the voters this year cast their votes as follows: For license, 2592, for pro hibition, 4724, majority in favor of prohibition, 2133. This short exper ience with the saloons seems to be enough for Brockton, as the vote was very large and showed the feeling of of the people. A despatch received from Paris is as follows: "The United States and Spanish Peace Commissioners con cluded their work to-day, and finally settled the terms of the treaty of peace. They willlmeet once more in, formal session, on Saturday or Monday next when the Spanish Commissioners, sorrowfully, and the Americans with feelings of relief, will write 'their signatures upon the document which embodies the results of the war, and the preparation of which has consum ed eleven weeks, a longer time than the war itself. In the meantime, the treaty will be engrossed under the supervision of Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda, the secretaries of the respect ive commissions." Secretary Alger's annual report is a verv interesting document, embrac ing, as it does, a brief, but compre hensive sketch of the conduct of the war, with copies of all official orders relating to the army, etc. A careful study of it will remove the last ves tige of foundation for most of the stories attacking the management of the "War Department. For instance, the official figures of the wounded in the Santiago campaign are a complete refutation of the stories that the wounded were not properly cared for. There were 140 surgeons with General Shafter's army. The total number of wounded was 1,431, of whom only 13 1 died of their wounds, a percentage as remarkable in the history of the war as some of the more talked about achievements of the war. President McKinley's annual mes sage to Congress is a thoroughly pat riotic from start to finish. There is not a word of partisanship in it. The message will not only be read with in terest, but will be carefully preserved, as it is an authentic, condensed his tory of the events leading to the war with Spain, of the war, and of the re sults of the war, so far as they are known at this time. It is, in itself alone, sufficient to place . President McKinley in the very front rank of American statesmen, if he had noi already attained that position. It is necessarily long, but contains no platitudes, no striving after effect nor bids for popular favor. It is a plain statement of the most impor tant events in the country's history, by a man whose patrioitism has been proven by trials such as few men have gone through. It ought to be read in every school-house in the land and studied as a lesson in current Amer ican history. Even the most partisan democrats find nothing in it to ob ject to, which is something very un usual in Presidents' messages. The attendance at the opening of Congress was quite up to the average, both on the floor of the House and Sen ate and in the galleries. Speaker Beed opened the House, his smiling face in dicating a contentment that must have been envied by those democrats who have been engaged in overthrow ing him, on paper. Vice President Hobart presided over the Senate in his usual dignified manner. Among the notable Senatorial absentees were Senators Davis of Minn.; Frye of Me. and Gray of Delaware, who detained in Paris by their work as American Peace commissioners, but who expect to complete the treaty of peace and start for home in a very few days, the difficult part having been accomplish ed when the Spanish Commissioners agreed to our terms, a week ago. THE 

TREASUR Y REPORT. The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury is this year of far more than the usual interest, for it sets forth the results of the war in increased taxation, revenue and ex penditures. Of course, the report does not cov er the entire war, for the fiscal year 1898 ended on June 30. But the last four months of the year were months of active military preparation and the last two were months of actual hostilities. This is reflected in the sudden mounting up of our army ex penditures to nearly $92,000,000, and of our navy expenditures to nearly 59,000,000. But all this increase was given in a good cause and it has pro duced glorious results. The people do not begrudge the cost, though one immediate effect is a deficit in our national finances. The total expend itures for 1898 were $532,381,201.35; the receipts were $494,333, 953. 75, leaving an adverse balance for the year of $38,047,247.60. Secretary Gage estimates that there will be a deficit of $112,000,000 in the present fiscal year, and of $30,000,000 in the hscal year 1900. This ought to make it ob vious to everybody that it will be a considerable time before the war tax ation can safely be dispensed withj In foreign commerce, as the Jour nal has already shown from time to time, the year 1898 has been the record-breaking year in American his tory. The total exports of the products of American industry were the heav iest ever recorded. For the first time in our history our exports averaged more than $100,000,000 a month. For the first time, also, our exports of manufactured goods exceeds our im ports of foreign manufactures. More over, our total exports were double our total imports and the balance of trade in our favor was by far the larg est ever known. The most important recommenda - tions of Secretary Gage's report are those relative to the strengthening of our merchant marine. Secetary Gage believes that the time has come when some positive action is imperative. He favors, first, the remodeling of the Postal Subsidy act of March 3, 1891, to bring it up to latest requirements; second, the establishment of a system of graded bounties upon a mileage basis for the encouragement of Amer ican vessels in the foreign trade, and special provision for the deep sea fish eries this legislation to have direct reference to the national defence; third, an extended application of the act of May 10, 1892, by which the In man liners City of Paris and City of New York were abmitted to American registry and two sister ships, the St. Louis and St. Paul, were built in American shipyards but Mr. Gage would not have this affect the coast wise trade; fourth, an increase in our tonnage taxes to the European level; fifth, tha restrictions of trade be tween the United States, Porto Rico and Hawaii and the coasting trade of the islands to ships of American reg istry.
