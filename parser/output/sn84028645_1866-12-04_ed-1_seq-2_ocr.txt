The President's Second Annual Message. i 1 i This morning's Statesman carries to the reader the Second Annual Message bf Pfeii d int Johnson. It U worthy of the man and the occasion. In language, It Is deco rous; In argument!, touching the non-rep r Men tod States, It Is unanswerable;, The non-represented States are members of the Union, by Constitutional right eo; recog nized by every department of the Federal Government since the overthrow and sur render of the Rebellion; 1 Most fool-hardy would it be, then, to put those States Into a territorial condition and to bold them In definitely In that relation. For such course there Is absolutely no need,. were there In the Constitution even an Implied right (which there is not) under cer tain circumstances to so deal with them. With great propriety have the. people of those Stages conducted themselves since . the surrender of the Confederate armies, Dispassionate men, who will sit down and deliberately take Into account the 'obsti nacy aud , persistency with which' t-hey fo ight to take themselves out of the Union fr the purpose ,ot eatapnsninjt an niue- pendent Republic the great sacrifices ihey made to this end can not otherwise than admit that the order they have maintained Since they abandoned all hostility to the Federal Government has been Immeasurably- in excess ot the expectation that was generally entertained at the time of such abandonment by the Confederate armies. ".Nineteen months . ago they sur rendered.; And how well- they have kept faith is illustrated by the President's as surance tbat peace prevails everywhere, throughout the limits of the United States, and no where more profoundly than In the lately insurgent States. Nothing Of con-t tumscy to the Federal authority Is there exhibited;" joothlng of discontent at the supremacy of the Federal power Is there shown. As dutifully do they perform their duties as do the people of Ohio perform theirs; Natural it Is, in view of this, that the President should assert, with an air of proud satisfaction, that time has but Strengthened his conviction In the benefi cence of the policy he has thus far carried jout, and the views he urged upon the con sideration of Congress in his first Annual Message. , ..'.."".'.', , The President's argument Is precisely what it was one year ago. Save in one par ticular, the work of restoration is complete. "With everything that could rightfully be demanded, as an attestation of sincerity in future to behave themselves in the Union, the Insurgent States have complied. Slav ery they have abolished forever, and they have made provision that the Slaves thus set free Bhall be protected in life, person and . property ; Secession they- have renounced for all time, aim Confederate or Rebel debt they have repudiated. Does this furnish ground on which to bottom surprise that the President cannot see the propriety of longer denying to those States their right of representation in both branches of Congress ? lie don't undertake to say who shall and who shall not be Senators and" R 'presentatives. That Is a . question,! the determination of which, he leaves1 precisely where the Constitution leaves it with Congress and the people of the re-! 1 spectlve States; bbt'her does ask, in the1 name of the Constitution In the name of Republican government-thatthe now ex-l eluded States shall immediately be ad mitted to full Statehood. Tie asks that this shall be done that the material Interests of the country may be promoted. Rightfully pdoei Tie "believe that as long as Congfless shall arbitrarily exclude ten States front ; their constitutional rights la the Union, that Just so long must the business lnterf ests of the country necessarily suffer. Further amendments to the Constitution he evidently does not think should be taken Into consideration until' the now ex .. eluded States are admitted to a voice in. the Federal Congress. Hence,, he . makes no allusion to the pending Constltu , tionol. Amendment;' hence, he makes no reference to Universal or Impartial Suf frage. Steadfast and true, without change or variation, he adheres to the policy Be ' has thus far pursued, and which has been ' ' sa salutary' fn pacifying the South, arid 1 ' causing love for the old Union to grow up - In the hearts of those who lately, were io ; Implacably bent on flghtloj their wayo it Of it.i :t 1 .. . . ii" v r?i. .

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. FtlloithCUizena n tht Senatt and Houte qf Jiepraentative : After a brief interval the Congress of the United States resumes its annual legisla tive labors. An all-wise and merciful Providence has abated the pestilence which visited our shores, leaving Its calamitous traces upon some portions of our country, Peace, order, tranquility, and civil author ity have been formally declared to exist throughout the whole of the United .States.: In il-. of the States . civil ! authority has superceded the coercion of arms, and tho people, by their voluntary action, are maintaining their Governments In full activity and complete operation. The enforcement of the laws Is no longer ' obstructed In any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordl- ' nary course of Judicial proceedings ;M and th animosities eneendered by the war are rapidly yeldiugl-'t6 the bcneflcient innuences Ol our ireo mowi.ui.i""'. " i to'., the kindly . eflcctt of unrestricted rirlni and commercial Intercourse. - An entire restoration of -fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of' every patriotic heart; and we ' will have -ac-lahpH nur grandest national achieve mtiitufhen.'forirettinir ttie sad events of tha no at. on ft remembering OlllV their in truotlva lessons, we resume onr onward career as a free, prosperous, and united people J, i tn mv messacre of December 4, 1805, Con irr. v informed of the measures which Kart hven instituted bv the Executive with a view to the gradual restoration 'of tho Kt&tea In wtilcn llie insurrecnon wcuncu to their relations with the General Govern nunL Provisional . Governors had been Appointed, Conventions called,. Governors elected, Legislatures assembled, and Sena tors and .Representatives cnosen io mt vuh of the United Kates. Courts had been opened for. tbe; enforcement of laws inner in fthnvunpe. The blockade had been removed, custom houses re-established, and tlie Internal revenue laws : put in force, '' In order that the peoi pie' might contribute to the Na Postal oDerttlons had been renewed, and efforts were being made to 'rpahorA thp m to their former condition of ofll!lnpv. The States themselves had been asked to take Part in the high function of amendlncr the , Constitution, and of thus aaiiptloninir the extinction of African slav ;ery as one of the legitimate results of our .internecine struggle. ,. : Having progressed thus far, the 'Execu round that It had accora Iplished nearly all that was within' the scope of its constitutional authority. One : thing, however, yet remained to oe aone 'bnfore the work ot restoration ! could i be completed, and that was the admission ! to' Congress' of loyal Senators and Representatives " from the States whose ! people had rebelled against tiie lawful au I thojjty of the General Government. Thia questiou devolved upon the respective Houses, which, by the Constitution, ard made the tudges of the elections, returns, and qualifications ot their own members; and Its consideration at once engaged the attention of Congress. , ' In the meantime, the' Executive Depart ment no other plan having been proposed by Congress continued its efforts to perfect, as far as was practicable, the restoration of the proper relations between the citizens ef the respective States, the States, and the Federal Government, extending, from time to time, as. the public Interests seemed to require,: the judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the country. With the advice and consent of the Sen ate.the necessary officers were appointed, and appropriations made by Congress for the payment of their salaries. The propo sition tp amend tne Federal Constitution, so ss lb prevent the existence of slvery within the : United States or any place subject to their .juris diction, was ratified by the requisite uum Dr ofSutee; nd-ou the 18th day of De cember, 1865, it was offlcialry declared to have bpcome valid as a tmrt of the Consti tution ot the United States. All of the States in which the Insurrection had ex isted promptly amended their Constitu tions, so as to make them conform to the great change thus effected in the organic law of the land j declared null and void ail ordi nances and laws of secession ; repudiiited all pretended debts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes of the lnsurrecr tion ; and proceeded, in good faith, to the en actment of measures for the protection and amelioration, of the condition of the colored race:' Congress, however, yet hesitated itp admit any of these States to representation ; and it was not until towards the close of the eighth . month of the session that an. excep tion was (mde in favor of Tennessee; by the admission of her Senators and. Representa tives.: i i,. , . . . ''"; i I deem it a snbjeot of profound regret that Congress has thus far tailed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Representatives from the other States, whose inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion. , Ten States more than one-fourth of toe whole nnmoer Temain wunom representa tion the seats of fifty members in the House of Representatives and of twenty members in the Senate are yet vacantnot toy thair own consent, not by afailoreof election,bpt by the refusal of Congress to accept their cre dentials. Their admission, it is believed, wonld have accomplished muon, towards the renewal and strengthening , of our c relations as one people, aud re moved serious causer for discoatent on the fart of the inhabitant of those States. t woaid have accorded with the great prjnr iple ,; ennnoiated in , the Declaration of American Independence, that no people ought to bear the harden of taxation, and fetbe denied the right of representation,-!-t wonld have been in consonance with the express provisions of the Constitution, that ' each State shall have at least one Repre sentative," and "that no- State, iwith ont its consent, ' shall "' be ; depriv ed of ' Its - equal - suffrage' ' in the Senate." ' These provisions were intended to seonretd every 8tate, and to the people of ev ery State, the right of representation in eaoh Hons of Congress; and so .important .was it deemed by the frauiers ol the Constitution that the equality of the States In the Senate should be preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Constitution can any State, without it consent, be denied a voice in that braneh-ef-the National Legislature. It is troe, it has been assumed that the existenoe of the States- was terminated; by the rebellious sets of their inhabitants, aud that the insurrection having been suppress ed, they were thenceforward to be consid ered merely as' oonanered territories. The Imlative. Exeontive and Judicial Depart ments of the Government have, however, with crest distinctness and uniform eonsis iencv. refused ' to sanction an assump tion ao incompatible with the nature of our republican -system, and with tie pro fessed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legislation of Congress, the undenia ble fact makes itself apparent, that these ten political communities- are nothing less than States of thu Union. At the very oom t of the rebellion, each House declared, with ajunanimity as remarkable as as it was - significant, . that . the war not . "waged, , k upon onr parsf in any spirit of oppression, nor for any pur pur. pose of conquest or subjugation, nor pose of overthrowing or interfering : wrih the ri.rht or Mt&blishod institutions of loose States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of .the Constitution and all Jaws made in pursu ance thereof, and to preserve the ijnion wiin all the .dignity,, equality, and rights, of-the several State unimpaired ; . and that as soon u theaa obiects" were " accomplished th war nncht to cease." ' In soma instances Senators ware uermitted to continue their logii latlve functions, while in other instances Hnnreeentatives were elected and admitted to seats after Jheir States had formally rte- tslarud tuoir right to wituoraw iroin tne ir.inn and were endeavorinir. to maintain that right by force of arms. All of the States whose people were in insurrection, ii States, Were included in the apportion ment of the direct tax of twenty millions of dollars annually laid upon the united States by the act approved 5th August, 1HG1. Congress, by the act ot ilavcu i, ifso, and by tluj apiiortionment of representation thereunder, also recognized their presence Stntwi In the Union l nnd they have, for iudieial purposes, been divided intd districts, A i. Tim Bntnn as Diaies tiiunu cn o ,4iii... recognition appears in the recent legislation Iff reference to Tennessee, which evidently rnM nnnn tho fnet that tlio functions or xuo State were; not desttoyedl by the rebellion, but merely suspcudea; nna rnai jinncipio Is of course applicable to those States which, like Tennessee, attempted to rcuounce their places in the Union. . . - The action of the Executive Department of tho Government npou this subject bss been equally definite and uniform, and the purpose of tho war was specifically Stated in 'the Proclamation issued by my predeces sor on the Jd day of September, Ji2. , It was then solemnly proclaimed and declared that " hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of pnfctically n.irimrha nnuif nfcimtuLrelation between the United States and each of the States aud the people thereof, J,n , wUicn. isiaies mm ro ltin iii or nmv lie s'lsnended 6r dlstui'bed. I The renotrnition of the States by the Ju- rfinUl Dimiirtment of the Government has also been clear and conclusive in' all pro-, coedings rafl'ooting them as States, hud in the Supreme, Circuit, and District Court. In the aduiission of Senators and Repre- fpotn anv And all of the States, there can bo uo just ground of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers ot legislation; i or in is Qould not liappen when the Constitntion And the laws axe enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress., Each House is made the ? judge, of .,the elections, ' returns;- and qualifications ,pf Its own menibolV and niay, "with, the concurrence' of two-thirds,-expel n. member." . When a Senator or Iiep resentatiye presents his cortifieate of clee tion, he may at once bo admitted or rejected! or, sliould there be any question as to his eligibility, his credentials may be referred for investigation to the appropriate commit tee If admitted to a seat, it. must be upon 'evidence satisfactory' to 'the Houso of, which ho thus becomes a 'member, that ho ' possesses 'the requisite- 'consti tutional,., and legal qualifications. " If re fused admission as a momber for'' Want Of due allegiaudo to the Government, aud returned to his constituents', they are. admonished that nono but persons loyal to ha 1 'nit id Sbites will be allowed a voiefl in the.Legislative Councils of the.Nailoit, and the political power aud moral mimenco oi Congress are thus efi'ectively exdrteYl in the7 interest of loyalty. to the Govonnnefft and fidelity , to tho Union. Upon ; this , -question, so vitally affecting the' roHtoratinn of tho Union aud the pennanency of ou present "form '-of,. Government,- my 'con-i victions, heretofore expresHed, have undcr gone no chaugo ; hut on the contrary, their correctness 1ms been confirmed by reflection and. time. If the admission of loyal mem bers to scats iu the respective Houses of Congress was wise and expedient a year ago, it i no loss wise and expedient now. If this anomalous condition is right now if, in the exjict condition of these States at the present time. it is lawful to exclude them from representation, I djo not see that the question will, be changed by the etllux of time. Ten years houce, if these States re main as they are, the rifjht of representa tion will be no stronger the right of exclu sion will be no weaker. .- ' 11 The Constitution of the . United States makes it the duty of the President to rect otnrnend to the consideriHion of Congress 'such measures as he shall judge necessary or expedient." I know of no measure more imperatively demanded by every consider ation of national interest, sound policy, and equal justice, than the admis sion , of loyal : members from the now . unrepresented; States. "This would consummate the work of restora tion, and exert a most salutary Influence iu the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and fraternal feeling. It would tend great lv to runew the confidence of the American people iu the vigor and stability of their institutions. It would bind m more close- iv toiether as a nation, and enable us to show to the world the inherent ' and recu perative power of a Government lounrieu upon the will of the people, and establish ed upon the principles ot noerty, justice and intelligence. Our Increased strength aud . enhanced prosperity would lrreCragau),y demonstrate the fallacy of . the i. arguments . against free institutions drawn from our recent nation al disorders by the enemies of republican government. The admission or lovat mem ber from the States how exclude! from. Congress, 'by allay lug doubt aiid appre-, hension, wouici turn capital, now awmvinK an ODDortunity1 tor investment, inW the channels of trade and industry;1 It would alleviate the present troubled condition oi those States, and, by inducing emigration, aid , in the settlement ot fertile re gions now uncultivated, ' and lead to an increased prouucnonoi mose smpics which have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and the 'commerce of Wiq world. New fields of enterprise wouiu'be opened to our progressive peiple, and soon the devastations ot war -would be repaired, and all trace of our domestic differences effaced from the Winds, of ouncountry men. In our efforts to preserve vthe, unity, or Government whiqU constitutes us que peo ple," by restoring the States to the , copdij tion which they held prior to,, the rebel lion, we should be cautious, .lest, having mtohitpri on r nation from Derili of, threaten ed disintegration, we resort ,to cousolidaK tion, and in me ona noeom&e, ucipoiistn, as a remedy c'lor t the .recurrchde of similar troubles., The..war,:uavliitr terminated,! i aud withji it. .all' Oocca:loi for' " the , exercise,! ot,, t powers i, oi donbtful constitntiopality, we should hast en to bring legislatloc ,withln, the bounda ries prescribed by the.

"The Constitution which at any time exists, until changed by an ex plicit and authentic act oi me, wiioib jjku- ple, is sacredly obligry upon all." "ft, ir, the oniuion . of i the pcopli!', thei distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be. iu any par ticular, -wrong, let. it be, corrected by an amendment iu the, way in which the Con stitution designates, .Jiu t let there" be po phnfB bv usurDation:. for" "It is tliepds tomarv weaoOU-UV wuicn iree uovern- ments are destroyed"' WAsmNOTOs spoke tlicse word to his "countrymen, wlien, fol lowed by their love and gratitude, he voir untarlly retired iroin me cares of puuno life.

Jackson held that theaction ol the General Government Should always be strictly confined to the sphere of its apiro nrintM duties, arid lustlv1 and i forcibly urged that Our Government' is not. to be maintained nor our Union preserved "by Invasions of the rights and powers of the several States.

Of this deter mination, however, the United States had not received any-notice or intimation; and, .so soou as the iufoimation was recoivtd by the government, care was taken to make known Its' dissent to tho Emperor of Frarfee.
