Several resolutions are now pending before the Legislature on the above lighly important subject. We ar. phased to see the spirit which seems to actuate the members in relation to the Conventi .11. They are acting cau tiously, cain.lv, deliberately. This .s an earnest that they will act wisely and m I i rn..nntr.n Will h caiied i iliai a v.u;io"..-" ..!.:. tl . .. JUr .lo mrn an admitted fact. T.c details mav wel: -;. .uwe. aiscusswn and inter r ;j i j i change of views. In annecuon-with the subject of Convention, we like the resolutions in troduced in the. Senate on last Satur day, declaring the sense of the people of North Carolina in regard to the hoaiestead and the riKht of suffrage p The first resolution enacts that the people of North Carolina are opposed to any ameuduieut of tbe Constitution which alters article 10 of that instru nient, guaranteeing the homestead and personal property exemption, and that the decision of the Supreme Court on this subject should remain the settled law of the land. The second resolu tioa declares "that the right of suf. frage as secured by the Constitution of this State ought, for all time, to re main inviolable, thereby granting to every class of our male population re gardless of race, color or previous con , . ,. f ; the inalienable privilege ot dition. voting for every office and place ot!?u"V V nyn crimes ana mumean- trust conferred by the Constitution ; i " ,ws' be tHrne(I of office.

We admire the spirit of these two resolutions, and heartily endorse them. In calliug a Convention, it is well to let the people know that we do not pro pnse to interfere with the homestead law and the riirht of suffrage. This ' v- takes the wind completely Irom the! ... . sails of the Radicals who are attempt- inz to raise a ircat hue and cry about ! the rights of which the Democratic Convention would deprive the people, and especially the colored voters, if one should be called by the Legislature. We n:ust act in the purest good faith; at the same time with strict candor, impartiality and boldness. A Convention will be called to cor - rect abuses; to abolish the present evils ' under which our people are labr ring ; to form a more suitable and economical Constitution ; to da away with useless and expensive offices; to lop off the extravagant brandies which the carpet bag abortion has introduced into our system ; and, in a word, to retuod.-l ' our present form of State Erovernment. by Ktainiog what is good, necessary and expedient, and rejecting what is Daa, UDSUIt&Dle ana Od'.OUS. Removal of Governor Vance's Disabilities. The friends of General Abbott as sert that, there is no probability that Governor Vance's disabilities will be removed by Congress, and iu the event of the refusal of Congress to relieve him, that Abbott will claim the feat iu the United States S nafe. on the ground cf receiving the next highest nutiiber of votes. The Standard already boasts that Abbott is entitled to the position While it has beeD the policy of Con- gres.a, heretofore, to seat the minority candidates, when those who received tho majority were ineligible, yet this has beeu doue only in the House of Representatives, and we trut it will not be attempted in the Senate. Gove'nor Vance, it is said, Las as- surancesirom nigh Republican sources, that he will be admitted to hi3 seat, la case he fails of admission, he prom- ises to resign, and thus allow the Leg - lsia.ure to eiect a enator who is not j mony, we are the last to be influenced banned. We must confess that we j by tho insidu3us arguments of the Rad have but little faith in Radio 1 prom- jCal lenders. ises ; but there seems to be a strong We too well know their onlv nhWt feeling throughout the North in fivor of enfranchisement and universal am nesty, as we stated last week It mnu h that the Radical Congress will pay some heed to the popuhtr will on this subject, so unmistakably expressed, re- cently, through the ballot box, and pass a general amnesty bill. If so. Governor Vance will be permitted to take his seat, and we will then have iu the United States Senate an able champion j and an eloquent advocate of our rights nd interests. But we very much doubt Covgresxional clcmencj. The claim of Abbott to ti e Sena torship is as arrogant as it is unfound ed. Receiving only forty-three out oi all the votes cast by the Legislature, being a little more thau one fourth, it will be a fit aud appropriate finale oil ,. . , . , ... uis political eaieer in tne state, touud j liim knocking at the door of the Senate : lor admission as the member elect from North Carolina. Will the Senate give him the place, even it Governor Vance is excluded ? - We hope not. The ontnice will be too gross for a body ciuuniug to be the. Seuate oi the United States to perpetrate. The French evacuated Orleans on Saturdiy. Before leaving they spiked Impeachment. No definite action has yet been taken by the Legiflatnre to brinjj to justice those individuals in b'.nh officii posi tions who hate proved recreant to the trusts repesed in thera and covered themselves with infamy and disgrace. It has been suggested by some that the better plan to get rid of the whole crew who have been preying upon the vitals of the State for more than two 3ears. will be to call a Convention to alter the Constitution, and thus wipe out at one stroke the whole brood o' political cormorants who have bank rupted North Carolina, profaned the sacred temple of justice, and through the Legislative, Judicial and Exee v l " nieut combined, torn do.vn the safe .Miards of the Constitution aud scatter ed into fragments every relic of her former greatness and glory. In favor of this plaD, expediency, economy and certainty are claimed. We are iudifferent as to the process, provided the guilty officials be speedily ousted from their positions. It there he any other plan than impeachment whereby Holden. Pearson Junes, Watts and others who have so plainly, shame lessly and corruptly violated the law, can he disposed of summarily, without the delay, expense, excitement and raucor which might be incidental to a trial of impeachment, then it would perhaps be belter to adopt that plan. Wc are illy able to incur any unneces sary expense, provided the same pur pose can be effected in a more speedy ' I I and economical way. In any event aud at all hazards, but in a fair. Wal. legitimate manner, the officials who are , f , . , ido not for a moment believe that the Legislature will shrink from its duty . - ....

They call their wretched and ridiculous bluster 'prin. iple. It is one-halt cant and tbe oth r half iguorance, which, when ''"roughly mixed, is what we call T ' . . , Louisville CourierJournal The above remarks apply with pecu liar force to certain journals in this State, which have been parading their (so-called) Democracy to the world, and, at the same time, so far as their pitiful influence was concerned, aiding and abetting the Radical party. Is it not a little remarkable that the editors of such papers never in their lives voted a straight-out old line Democratic lieket? .

We regret the same wise policy has not been pursued in this State. For the sake of defeating the Radicals, the old line Democrats in North Carolina, as a party, have wheeled into line, and have battled agaibsi.a"d will continue to battle against the cohorts of Radical ism, regardless of party names or asso ciations. The Democrats will not be driven into the support of Radicalism under any circumstances, or while smarting undt-r any wrongs ; and while we protest against the policy which has excluded them thus far from almost any share in the distribution of politi cal honors won since the war by what is known as tbe Conservative rart, they wi!!, for the sake of harmony, continue to labor with any organization having ior its object the overthrow of ' the Radical party, and which aims to rescue North Carolina Iroui the clutches ol the political villains who have brought the State to the verge of bank ruptcy and ruin. Our Public Lands.

The question might then be determined, either by the action of the Senate on the treaty, or by the action of both Houses ou a resolution of annextion, as in the case of Texas. He calls the attention of Congress to the continuance and extension of the Mexican Free Zone, and to the Tien stein marsacre. In regard to the Alabama claims he recommends thattongiess authorize the appointmetit of a Conimissiou to take proof as to these claims, and that authority be given for their settlement by the United States so that the Gov ernment shall have the ownership of the private claims as well as the respon sible control of all the demands against Great Britain. In regard to the Cana dian fisheries, he complains that the course of the Canadian authorities has not been marked by a friendly feeling, and intimates that if they should at tempt to enforce a certain act of the Dominion Parliament, it wi 1 be his du ty to take such steps as may be neces sary to protect the interests of United States citizens. He asks that power be conferred upun him to suspend the operation of laws authorizing the transit ot merchandise, in bond, th rough the United States to Canada, and also to suspend the operation of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion ire permitted to enter the waters of the United States. He also complains of the pretensions of Canada to control the navigation of the St. Lawrence, and J arguei on the importance asd. right f - . . iriii-rinw the. tjitedta(esto uavigate thatriy er without let or hindrance. In regard to the depressed condition of the for eign commerce of the Uoited ctates, he recomnipnds & liberal policy towards the Pacific Mil between California. China aud Japan. He also recommends that measures may be taken to permit American merchants to purchase ves sels built abroad, as well as to encour age American ship building. In re gard to the currency the President says i hat tne approacn to a specie oasis m very gratifying, but that the instabili ty of the currency is very prejudicial to our prosperity. He- thinks that the time hasarrived when, by wise and prudent legislation, Congress should look to a policy whicfi would place cur rency at a par with gold, at no distant day In regard to revenue reform he says if i means to keep the revenue down to what is necessary ior the sup port of the Government and the pay ment of interest on tbe public debt it has his hearty support; but if it mean 9 failure to provide the necessary means to defray all of th expenses of the Government he is opposed to it.

VANCE. Serenade to .'Gov. Vance -Speech. -His Governor Vance was serenaded at his lodgings at the Exchange Hotel the evening of hia election as Senator. Having just prepared to leave the city by the Western train, the address was necessarily short. He said: Fellow Citizens : I hardly know what to say, how much to say, and how much not to say. I should be either more or less than human if I did uot feel grateful to you and the people of North Carolina for many kindnesses. 1 am unable to account for the kind ; ui's ol the people in honoring me to often.' 1 know it cannot be lor any superior merit of oiy own. 1 can only tribute it to one thing. Human ture is a very commou thing, aud there l a crfcac acul ol 1 ,n nnroanJ- (Laugnttr.; A great deal has been said of'ttie hypocrisy of politicians, of the ingratitude ot republics; but it is a principle m human nature that.be ))' position where that people olace ,u,u Imu, be the caue right or wrong, will L;l- honored by them. 1 must sav that I -;Ci. that 1 have doue so. 1 was reared a Whig ; a party devoted to the Luiuu ; as a big 1 fought disunion, and stood by the Union even until in i Uie toutu generally, feeling itself ag grieved, Unionism became very unpop- u!ar. 1 still adhered to it until my I State, in her sovereign capacity, at J tempted to disserver her connection I with that Union I then elected to go j with my State, my kith and kio. Hav iuir joined the army I determined to serve the new cause with the same un swerving zeal with which I had served that of tbe Union. I was called upon t support acts which had uot before a rwl rtl.l rtk I linn vrifi.tt ni ti nn.Aunl li.a L t j ' the general good. I served as your Governor ; 1 clung with you to the cause, and did not surrender my au- thorny until the last hungry, ragged Cnniederate had laid down his arms. Alter the war terms upon conditions were held out to t.ht nonrile nf I h Smith. 1 would not accept terms that would separate me from you and the brave bos who went at your bidding. The longest road has a turn. I did not wish to rise until I could rise With you. Thank God, that time has arrived. We go up now. We may go down again, but will go down together ; and 1 will have witb me good company, the best and bravest hearts in tbeland with me. Lecausc our party has been triumphant there are some who urge retaliation. This should not be so. The best aoti- , doie for tyranny, the strongest weapon a-ar.t it, is tbe enactment ot just and . .... the government ol North Carolina in our lianas, we snouia not ami to avenge ourselves for tbe overriding of civil iiberty auions us, but we should so ar ranue that it cannot happen again should see to it that no executive or other authority can again attempt to dvstroy our liberties. From the ob taining of Magna Charta to the pres ent day no attempt to override or abridge it has been made that has not more firmly reestablished liberty. May it be so here. It is true that in the last five years we have felt what it is to be without trial by jury, to have arrests among us without warrant, and the freedom of the press abridged. All the people understand it now. It behooves us now to build up tbe great principles- ot civil hbertj ou the eternal rock of our great country. Let anger, revenge, and retaliation be ignored, and let the laws on your statute book bear the im press of a free people determined legi timately to maintain'their freedom. In my place in the Senate, I shall endeav or to serve my great State and my country with honor. That I shall be admitted to serve you scarcely admits of a doubt. The President's message, it is said, will foreshadow amnesty, and the recnt elections show the hand writing on the wall. There are many great statesmen among the dominant party in Congress, representing large constituencies, among hom a tremen dous revolution in sentiment on these questions has taken place. Those men and the great American people,wbo after a long war of blood and carnage, result ing in the freedom of the African, will no longer tolerate the enslavement of the Anglo-Saxon. Every law. both State and national, should be respect-.-d and obeyed by all our people, bit terness and vituperation should cease, and men, no looger endeavoring to de stroy each other, should earnestly strive to engender kindly feelings among all classes of our citizens. To bring about these desirable ends will be the earnest aim of my life, in Congress and else w here I thank you, fellow citizens for your compliment. After the performances of several pieces by the Raleigh Colored Brass Band, Governor Vance left on the Western train foi hi hone in Charlotte. iiT rr-rnri The Homestead and Suffrage Question in tlid Legisla . ture. . The following action of tbe Senate on Saturday last upon a resolution de claratory of the sense of the people t f the State upon the subject of the home stead, personal property exemption and the right or sultrage, wiU be read with interest, as emphatically falsifying the charges of the Radicals that the Dem ocratic party intended to interfere with these privileges : Jtesolved, That the people of North Carolina are unalterably opposed to any amendment of the Constitution whereby the Homesteae and personal property exemption, secured by virtue of artic le 10, may be suspended and that the constitutionality of said article, as ex pounded by the Supreme Court ot North Carolina, meets the approval of the people of Nerth Carolina and should be regarded as the settled law of the land.. Resolved, That the right of suffrage as secured by the Constitution of this State ought for aJl time to re.ua in in violable, thereby granting to every class of our male population, regardloss of race, color or previous condition, the inalienable privilege of voting for eve ry office and place of trust conferred by the Constitution, aod that any ef fort to abridge the right of suffrage is contrary to the genius of our Govern ment and incomputable with the se curity and rights belonging to the people of North Caroiioa. Mr Morehead moved to amend the 1st resolution by inserting "nor upon the subject of mechanics' and laborers' lein law," which was adopted. Mr. Olds moved to amend by adding the following proviso : Provided, It be held as lawful, that tbe Homestead shall not be exempt from executions in criminal cases, which was voted down. G. W. Price, (col.) offered a substi tute for the resolutions declaiing that any attempt made to amend tbe Cn stitution at this time would be revolu tiouary in its tendency and should not be attempted, which was voted dowu Mr Linuey offered to amend as fol lows: ' Resolved further, That it be the sense of this body that the Homestead pro visions do not apply to damages rjcov- ered iu action tx de icto Mr. Morehead remarked that he hoped that this resolution would go out in such a form that a "wayJaring man though a fool" would understand that his Homestead was safe, that suffrage would not be interfered with and that a laborer could always under any cir cumstance receive the compensation ! i - i iri j.l be no latin phrase stuck to this, that designing men might use to misguide those who are not versed in law pharscs. Mr. Speed endorsed the remarks of the Senator from lloekinham, and was opposed to all amendments that wt u'd touch the-Homestead in any manner, and the amendment was voted down. On motion of Mr. Graham the clause in the 1st resolution "meets the ap proval of the people of North Carolina" was stricken out and tbe rcsolutiou as amended passed. The Grant Family inOlfi.ee. 1.
