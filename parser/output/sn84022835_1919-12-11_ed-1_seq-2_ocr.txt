SYSTEM IS URGED Necessity of Increased Production to Help Decrease Cost of Living Imperatlvo Need of Definlto Program Concerning Labor. Washington, Dec. U. President WII- eon's message, which uus rcud to both 'nouses of congress today, only Incl- dentally mentioned tho ponce treaty, blaming (lie delay In ratlllcatlon as one of the causes of nation-wide un reHt. Tlio president said: 1 hopo that conKrcss will tiring to a conclUHlon at this bohsIuii legislation look Inc to tlio establishment of a budget yH tem. That there should bo one bIiiu'Io uu thorlty responsible for the niuklni; of all appropriations and that appropriation) should be made not Independently of each other but with reference to one ultimo comprehensive plun of expenditure prop erly related to the nation's Income there can bo no doubt. 1 bellove the burden of preparing the budget must, In the nature of the case, If tlio work In to be properly done and responsibility concentrated In stead of divided, rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should bo sub mitted to and approved or amonded by a single committee of each house of con gress, and no single appropriation should bo made by the congress, except such as may have been Included In the budgot prepared by the executive or added by the particular committee of congress charged with the budgot legislation. Another and not less Important aspect of the problem Is the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated arc expended. Under existing law tho only audit Is for the purposo of ascertaining whether ex penditures havo been lawfully made with in the appropriations. No one Is author ized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, eco nomically and effectively. Taxation Question Taken Up. I truBt that tho congress will give Its immediate consideration to the problem of future tuxutlon. Simplification of the Income and profits tuxes hus buconio un Immedlato necessity. Theso taxes per formed Indispensable- service during tlio war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to buvc tho taxpayer Inconvenience- and oxpcnHo, but In order thut his liability may bo miidu certain and definite. With reference to the details of tlio revenue law, tho secretary of the treas ury und tho commissioner of Internal mv enue will lay before you for your consid eration certain umundments necessary or desirable In connection ulth tho numlnls trutlon of tho law recommendations which hao my approval and support. It Is of tho utmost Impoitunco thut In deullng with this matter tho present law should not bo disturbed so far as regards taxes for tho calendar yean 192U, payable In tho calendar oar 19.fl. Tho congress might well consider whether tho higher rates of Income and profits taxes can In peace times bo effectively productive ot rovcuuo und whether they may not, on tho contrary, be destructive of business activity and productlvo or waste und In efficiency. Thcio Is a point at which In peace times high rates of lncomo and prollts tnxus discourage energy, remove tho Incentive to new enterprise, encourago extiavugant xpenditures und produco Industrial slug, nation with consequent unemployment and other attendant ovIIb. The message then discussed tho fa vorable balance of trade und the need of adjusting our economic llfo to the changed conditions and of abandon ing the policy of Isolation. In the attcr of recognition and relief for returned soldiers tho president re peated tho recommendations In his last message. He also urged turlff revision to protect our chemical and dyestuff Industries. He continued: Farmers Are Praised. During tho war the farmer per formed u vital and willing service to the nation. Uy materially Increasing the production of his land, he supplied America and the allies with tlio In creased amounts of food necessary to keep their Immense armies In the field. He lndlsponsubly helped to win tho war. Hut there Is now scarcely less need of Increasing the production In food and the necessaries of life. I ask the congress to consider means of en couraging effort along these lines. The Importance of doing everything possible to promoto production along economical lines, to Improve marketing and to make rural llfo moro attractive and healthful, Ih obvious. I would urge approval of the plans ulready proposed to the congress by tho secrotary of ag riculture, to securo the essential facts required for tho proper study of this question, through the proposed en larged programs for farm management studies and crop estimates. I would urge, also, the continuance of federal participation In the building of good roads, under tho terms of ex isting law and under the direction of present ugenclcsj the need of further action on tho part of the states and tho federal government to preserve und develop our forest resources, especially through the practice of better forestry methods on private holdings and the extension of the publicly owned for ests; better support for country schools and the more definite direction of their courses of study along lines related to rural problems; and fuller provision for sanitation In rural districts and the building up of needed hospital and medical facilities. Blames Government for Unrest. I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political rest lessness in our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while various and complicated, are superficial rather than deep seated, Droadly, they arise 

HOME OF THE CIRCUS, A school teacher was reading an ex citing story to her group of young sters about tho jungle. In order that each chlltl might understand clearly what the story was about, she said: "Which one of you can (ell mo what the jungle Is?" One bright tittle boy waved his hand In tho air and the teacher told him to glvo his definition. He stood up before the clnss with a treat deal of Importance and said: "The Jungle It where the circus Uvea." from or nro connected with the failure on the part of our government to iir rlvo speedily at a Just Hiid permumut peace permitting return to normal con ditions, from tho transfusion of r.idicul theories from seething Kuropeuu centers pending such delay, from hrurtleti profiteering resulting In tho Increase of the coit of living, nnd, lastly, from tho machinations of passionate and multiv alent agitators. With the return to normal conditions, this unrest will rap Idly disappear. In tho meuntlme It does much evil. It seems to me that In dealing with this situation cougrcHs should not ho Impatient or drastic, but should seek, rather, to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country hack speedily to a peace basis, with ameli orated living conditions under the min imum of restrictions upon personal lib erty that Is consistent with our recon struction problems. And It should arm the federal government, with power to deal In Its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested Institutions. With the free expression of opinion nnd with tho advocacy of orderly polit ical change, however fundamental, there must be no Interference, but to ward passion and malevolence tending to Inclto crime and Insurrection under guise of political evolution them should be no leniency. Should Extend Food Control, t renew and strongly urge the neces sity of the extension of the present food-control act as to the period of time In which It shall remain In opera tion. The nttorney general has sub mitted a bill providing for on exten sion of this act for a period of six months. An It now stands It Is limited In operation to the period of the war and becomes Inoperative upon tho formal proclamation of pence. It Is Imperative that It should be extended nt once. The department of Justice has built up extensive mnchlncry for the purpoie of enforcing Its provisions; all of which must be abandoned upon tho conclusion of peace unless tho provi sions of this act oro extended. During this period the congress will have an opportunity to mnkn similar, permanent provisions nnd regulations with regard to all goods destined for Interstate commerce and to exclude them from Interstate shipment. If the requirements of tho law are not com piled with, Some such regulation Is Imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up In the manipula tion of prlcei by the withholding of foodstuffs nnd other necessaries of life ennnnt otherwise be effectively pre vented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legltlmncy of such measures. The president renewed his recom mendntlons that n law he passed reg ulating cold storage and that nil goods destined for Interstate com merce should be marked with the price nt which they left the hands of the producer. He nlso urged the fed eral licensing of corporations engag ing In Interstate commerce. Coining to (lie question of labor, the message said : Labor and Capital Pence Renewed. No one who has ol.crvcd the mnrch of events In tho last year can fall to note tho absolute need of definlto program to bring about an Improvement In the condition of labor. There can bo no set tled conditions leading to Increased pro duction and a reduction In tho cost of living It labor nod capital nro to be an tagonists Instead ot p.trtnors. Hound thinking and un honest dcslro to 'sorvo tho Interests of tho whole na tion, Hi? distinguished from tho Interests of u class, must bo applied to tho solu tion of this great and pressing problem. Tho fulluro of other nations to consider this matter In u vigorous way has pro duced bitterness and Jealousies und an tagonisms, the food of radicalism. Tho only way to keep men from agitating against grievances Is to remove the griev ances. An unwillingness even to discuss theso matters produces only dissatisfac tion' and gives comfort to the extreme elements In our country, which endeavor to stir up disturbance In order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation nnd repression. Tho seed of revolution Is repression. The remedy for these things must not bo negative In character. It must bo con structive. It must comprehend the gen eral Interest. Tho real antidote for the unrest which manifests Itself Is not sup pression but a deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy. Eight-Hour Day la Big Step. Congress has already shown Its will ingness to deal with these Industrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard In every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to prevent child labor. It has served the whole country by leading the way In de veloping the means of preserving and safeguarding lives and health In danger ous Industries. It must now help In tho difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuine demonstration of Industry, based upon tho full recognition of the right of thosa who work, In w hat over rank, to participate In somo organic way In every decision which directly uf fects their welfare. It Is with this purposo In mind that I called a conference to meet In Washing ton on December 1 to consider these prob. lems In all their broad aspects, with the Idoa of bringing about a better under standing between these two Interests. Rights of Labor Are Cited. Tho great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand far an Immediate consideration of tho diffi culties between capital and labor, bide us put our own houso In order. Frunkly, there can bo no permanent and lusting settlements between capital nnd labor which do not recognize the fundamental concepts for which labor has been strug gling through tho years. The whole world gave Its recognition and Indorse ment to these fundamental purposes In the League of Nations. To analyze the particulars In the do mands of labor Is to admit the Justice of their complaint In many matters that Ho at their basis. The workman demands an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live In comfort, unhampered by the fear of poverty and want In his old age. He demands the right to live and tho right to work umldst sanitary sur roundings, both In home and In workshop, surroundings that develop and do not re tard his own health and well-being; and the right to provide for his children's wants In the mntter of health and educn. tlon. In other words, It Is his desire to make the conditions of his life and tho

For motorists who smoke n new elec trie torch Is equipped with u clgnr lighter on one side, lives of those dear to him tolurable uml o.i sy to buur. Collective Bargaining Right. Governments must recognize th right of men collectively to bargain for humane objects that have ut their bise the mutual protection and woifuro of those engaged In nil Industries. I.ibor must not be longer touted us a com modity. It must bu regarded as th activity of human beings, possessed of d(cp yearnings and dislrts. 'I ho busi ness man gives his best thought to the repair and replenishment of his ma chinery, so that Its usefulness will not be Impaired and Its power to produce may always be at Its height und kept m inn vigor ami motion. No less regurd ought to bo paid to the humnn machine, which, nftor all, propels the machinery of the world und Is tho gie.it dynamic forco that lies back of all Industry nnd progress. Itcturn to tho old stnndards of wage and Industry In employment urn un thinkable. 'Iho terrible tragedy of war which has Just ended and which has brought the world to the vorgo of chaos and disaster would be In vain If there should ensue u return to tho con ditions of the past. " Labor not only is entitled to nn nde quate wage, but capital should receive a reasonable tcturn upon Its Invest ment and Ih entitled to protection at the hands of the government In every emergency. No government worthy of tho name can play theso elements against inch other, for there Is u mil tuillty of Interest between them which the government must seek to express anil to safeguard at all cost. The right of Individuals to strike Is Inviolate and ought not to bo Inter fered with by any process of govern ment, but there Is a predominant right nnd thnt Is tho right of tho govern ment to protect all of Its people and to assert Its power nnd mnjesly against the challenge of any clnss. The gov ernment, when It asserts that right, seeks not to antagonize n class but simply to defend tho right of the whole people as against tho Irreparable harm nnd Injury thnt might be done by tho attempt by any clnss to usurp a power that only government Itself has n right to exercise as a protection to all. Hour of Test and Trial. This Is the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess nnd strength nnd the Indomitable courage of her sol diers, sho demonstrated her power to vindicate on foreign battlefields her conception of liberty nnd Justice. Let not her Inllucnco as a mediator be tween capital nnd labor bo weakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concert be pro claimed to the world. Thcro arc those In this country who threaten direct action to forco their will upon a mnjorlty. IUissIa today, with Its "loon anu terror, is a p.untui onject ics- i son of the power ot minorities. It makes llttlo difference what minority It Is; whether capital or labor, or any other , class; no sort of privilege will over bo permitted to dominate this country. Wo are a partnership or nothing that Is worth while. Wo aro a democrncy where the ma- ' Jorlty nro the musters or all tho hopes and purposes of tho man who founded this government havo been dofeated and forgotten. In America thero Is but ono way by which great reforms can bo ac- i compllshed and tho relief sought by classes obtained, and that Is through tho orderly processes of representative gov- I eminent. Thosa who would propouo any I other method of reform are enemies bt ! this country. America will not be daunted by threats ' nor lose her composuro or calmness In theso distressing times. We can afford, In the midst of this day of passion and unrest, to bo self-contained and suro. Tho Instrument of ull reform In America Is tho straight road of Justice to all classes and conditions of men. Men havo but to follow this road to realize tho full fruition of their objects nnd purposes. Let those liownro who would take tho shorter road of disorder nnd revolution. Tho right road Is tho road ot Justice and or derly process. General Pershing aa a Grammarian. General Pershing, according to Ever ett T. Tomlinson, parsed himself Into the United States army. In "The Story of General Pershing" we are told that: "Eighteen applicants took the examination nnd Pershing won. though by only a single point, nnd that wns given only after he and his competitor, Hlgglnbotham, had broken the tie by ench diagramming the following sen tence: 'I love to run.'
