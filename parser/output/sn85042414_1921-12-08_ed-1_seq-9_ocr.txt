GUNNERY PRACTICE IS TO BE TESTED Xjon Angeles, Dec. 8.—Fleet gunnery officers and air squadron officers arc co-operating here in working out naval Banti-aircraft problems that promise, to furnish gunnery exercises in December that will startle the world in their thrill, according to in formation which has percolatcd from the conferences of the officers. Six K-5L type naval seaplanes, an air squadron under command of Lieut. Commander P. X. L. Bellinger, re cently came hero from San Diego. Captain H. V. Butler, commander of air squadrons, Pari fir: fleet, also joined the lorces in consultation. Targets hurtling through the air at ing speed. Highly important- in the exercises will be the aerial photograpliy, to re cord the results of the anti-aircraft fire. A large force of mechanicians, photographers, pilots and attendants of the naval air force has been brought hero on the Arostook. Extensive rehearsals will precede the actual firing and officers. It-Is said, expect, that result from these tactical exercises will bring forth information of greater value in determining aerial offensive and defensive possibilities than the recent bombing of German warcraft off Virginia Capes. Thirteen Million Insurance Policies Are Issued In 1921 New Tork, Dec. 8.—Reports to th« 15th annual convention of the Associ ation of Life Insurance Presidents here today were said to indloate that the new Insurance issued in the United States in 1921 will amount to 18,150, 000 separate policies for $8,6S5,000, 000. This will mark a decrease of throe-quarters of one per cent in the number of policies compared with last year, the most prosperous in life In surance history. The amount of new Insurance thus would be 15 per cent less than that of last, year and 2.6 per cent ahead of that of 1919. Statistics were presented by John M. Holcombe, president of the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance company of Hartford, Conn., who said that the 1921 record in new life insurance marks progress rather than retrogres sion, and is an encouraging index of returning normal business conditions. "Returns have been furnished by 148 of the 272 Qife insurance com panies doing business In the United States," said Mr. Holcombe. "These 148 companies wrote 97 per cent of the new business of 1920. Their 1921 returns are based on the actual amount of new business paid for up to I November 1 of this year, plus an estimate for the remaining two months. In 1920 the number of new policies issued was 13,248,000, Insur 1 Inr $10,105,000,000. "Twenty years ago, In 1901, Am erioan life Insurance companies wrote I $2,020,000,000 of new Insurance. A I decade later. In 1911, the amount of new Insurance was* $2,870,000,000, an increase of a little more than one third. In 1921, therefore, the issues were much greater than ever' before. Money was plentiful and the results of the war and the .epidemic of In fluenza had impressed upon the people the need of life insurance. In 1921, however, the business has been af fected by trade conditions, strikes, loss of «mployment and general re trenchment. Notwithstanding this, the amoupt of life insurance this year will exceed that of any single year, with the exception of 1920. "Up to 1919, new Jlfe Insurance oach yoar, on the average, Increased about. 10 per cent. This covered a, period of about 20 years. One year tho increase was as high as IS per cent. Another year It was as low as four per cent. Then, in 1919, came the nnparalleled Increase of 62 per cent over the n«»w business of 1918. Therefore, that the aggregate amount' of new life insurance In 1921 is less than that issued In 192U. is cause: nolther for surprifco nor disappoint ment. In moral potentiality, con sldtiring the conditions under .\yhich the 1921 new Insurance was ty^uffht by the American people, the results mark progress rather than retrogres sion."

INCREASE IN SIZE OF CADET CORPS AT WEST POINT URGED! Washington, Dec. 8.—An increase in size of the cadet corps of the West Point military academy from 1,334 to 2,500 is recommended by Brig.
