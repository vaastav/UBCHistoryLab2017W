unablo to testify for others But I can say that when ha desires your service I you may as well surrender I unfortunately It was not my good fortune to l > e present at the meeting of the Governors last year I did hear from that conference one expression that It seemed to me wan singularly apt and that line come In for criticism since That 18 lion the twilight zone of Federal Jurlsdlc lionThis This WM greeted by laughter which the President joined Mr Taft continued Till expression I think Is an admirably correct one for des rlbID something that will icrlnlnly present Itself n the working out of thc o problems The truth la that the overwhelming necessity presented by lrc ldnt Hoosevelt in his inspIring address for our ilolniz somethIng to conserve our natural resource In going to put us to a new lest of the practical character of our system of ioernment 4f Is going to Involve the iiucstlon whether with the changing condl tons and with the closer relations and Interdependence the various parts or thIs country our national Constitution wIll furnish the means of fleeting that neces ltyNow Now I have no doubt that it will because I see the effect of It already on democratIc minds When Joy Chamberlain goes up to the lour e of a tributary stream I Is not lone before he I goIng to climb to the top jl the tree J it Is true that forests and their continuance have a direct effect or the uniform navigability of streams then the right of the national Qovernmenl to go Into the cause of deforestation is not very far from constitutional demonstration Another reason why the Constitution should be so construed and without strain < log It to give to the national Government is much power 8 possible In this directions I s that the plan to meet the emergency nun be a comprehensive plan It nusl jo a plan covering the entire country and the financial resources of no State are equal to carrying out the plan a It ought to be ntrled out quite agree there will be many Instances h which It will tm Impossible even foi a Jemocrntlc convert to federalism to give ua Federal jurisdiction within the States and therefore that It h necessary to have cooperation on the part of the States But nothing could hare made that more possIble than to summon the chief executives of the Kate Into such conferences as that hlc le1 last aprlngand which Is meeting again his year Not my dear friends that U vas intended to set a Ore under Congress only that the information should be wide spread and come down to the people not only through Federal tributaries but also through the chief executives ortbe State I I shall content myself with the sUtemen of my deep sympathy with this new mQve nent and with my purpose should the lectors ot the various States bit upon a suItable candidate to do everything I can t carryon the purpose admirably begun and so wonderfully shown forth by Irest dent Roosevelt I concur In full with what the President has eald in reP the necessity of carry jog out projects completed In their plan and which will fit in to the general plan and also what has been said as to the Is suanveot bonds WhIle It Is true that the man who does not remember his children 18 worse than an Infidel It is also true that here a system can be devised by which the children ahull be madeto pay their per ton them Is no reason why these little fel lows who are growing up should not have a burden provide for them to keep them udder proper selfrestraint I have no compunctions on the subject of Issuing bonds if the debt to be contracted light to bo met by bonds I tblpk that len sometimes overdo the business of meeting what ought to distributed e unscs out of current Income I think there Is good reason for Issuing bonds for these Improvements that are to b per manent and not t spend current Income for them Sometimes it takes a much courage and Involve a much real public Interest to issue bonds for a purpose for which bonds ought to Reused alt does to pay a we go In other words I Isis mere question of comomlc policy and the mere fear of criticism that an Administration has issued bonds should not prevent us from doing justIce to ourselves and posterity TUB Weather
