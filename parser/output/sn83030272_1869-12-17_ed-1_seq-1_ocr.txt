Thero they ttood, many of them all day long, heedless of Iho drilling rain and mud and fog, out III darkness bade them depart. The subserviency of our Government to Spain ha emboldened the Spaniards more than ever, nnd they ( openly boasted )estrrday that they wore allowed to all unmolested for the snbj ligation of Cuba, hcrauso the United State dare not stop them, nor Incur Iho displeasure of the Peninsular hybtld Slate. Not wllUtanding the great activity which everywhere prrralls, It I doubtful even now whether tbe flotilla can be taken In sea to-day. Ho fare the Spanish authorities and Iho builder are aware no legal oestaelo will fall In their way; but tale last evening tliei bad not taken tn all their tore or furl. Hut even If they should tie roady to all to-day the! may pot gel away. It Is known that a band of determined men, Cubans and American, are pledged to effect their destruction or capture, Tho details are kept secret, but of Ihe purpose there It no donbt. Some or the gunboat are to be destroyed nd other captured, llelng unarmed, the gunboats, II Is believed, cannot defend themselves, nd the PUarto convoy will hardly dare fire a warlike ahot In American watcis. After the dolllla sail It will lake several day la reach Cubs, an the vissil will have to make two or three stoppage on Ihc way, provided, of course, Ihey meet wllh no unexpected obstacles. Tha office of Don Jo-f Prsant, 1) llroadway, was somewhat excited yrtterdny, and the attache were very reticent In retard to the enlistments which are being mads there from day to day.

Thrv, however, dlrrcted all applicants for Spanish gold to Mr. Dclamatrr's place, where the wants of Spain are best known. In the office were Don Dies de Itivera, sernnd attacho of the Spanish Lrratlon, and a nsval officer who has hern for the past four muntha superintending tbe bnlldlag and equipment erf the gunboats, consulting In regard to their departure. At tho door ttood two sailors from the l'lzarro, awaiting orders from Thirteenth street. In Itvlsarr A Penla'a ofllee. to South street, near Fnllon Ferry, engineers, firemen, and cooks wero enlisted.
