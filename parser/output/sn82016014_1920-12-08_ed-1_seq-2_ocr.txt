Harding stated today the special session of congress will be convened some time in March so that its work can be cleaned up early in the summer if possible. The call will be issued by him shortly after the inauguration. A special session of the senate imme jdiately after inauguration is necessary for confirmation of cabinet appoint ments but the call for this probably will be issued, according to the cus tom, by the retiring president. Harding's desire is to avoid further speeches before March 4. It is possi ble, however, that one or two invita tions may be accepted. Harding's brief but triumphal visit to Washington left his friends tre mendously pleased. The president elect was gratified at the reception given him and the cordiality shown. His formal call at the White House, where he left his card, removed from his visit to the capitol any suuspicion of discourtesy toward President Wil son, friends said.

John Williams, commander of Company I, Forty-eighth United States infantry, during the war, was held in Castle William, Governor's Is land today awaiting action by army officials on a confession he is alleged to nave made to police detectives here yesterday that he was a German spy. Altho he had been sought as a de serter, alleged to have absconded soon after the armistice with $6,000 in company funds, his confession of espionage came as a complete sur prise. Hugh J. Hannigan, a former lieu tenant under his command, on whose identification Willet was arrested, said not a man under the captain's com mana naa ever suspected he was a German sympathizer. Willet said, ac cording; to the detectives, that he was one of the 300 cadets who liad trained In Germany and were sent to this country to enlist In the United States army. The scheme, he is alleged to have said, was for the cadets to lead units of soldiers to France and expose tnem in dangerous positions for slaughter. Willet protested vigorously at first that he was not the man sought for desertion, but after two other former wnitcia ul ma uuiiiyuny corroDor&ieu Hannigan's identification, he sunk down in a chair and murmured. "You've got me!'" A few minutes later he became calm and deliberate and said: "I have nothing to regret. It Is Just the fortunes of war. Luck was against me and I'll have to pay." His wife, who was- formerly a Miss Crawford of Chicago, called at the police station early today after having heard of her husband's arrest and asked the police for his keys and his money. When told Willet had been taken to Govbernor's Island, she said she would go to see him later. .They have lived for more than a year on Riverside Drive, she said.

"At first Frank tried to make me believe he had married this woman while under the influence of liquor. I doubted this as he never drank while he was with me. Later I perceived that he was getting a check from; his uncle for one hundred dollars tevery month, and I wanted to know' why. It was therr-that he admitted that he had married the Smith girl merely as a convenience to his 'Uncle so tha't she might bear the -cme of Hamon and live with the oil man without arousing public suspicion.

I think he was more and more incensed after be learned that Mrs. Jake Hamon was getting $1,000 for the support of herself and her children in return for her tacit connivance in Jake's dual life. " 'As for Clara Hamon, she was angry, I know because Jake Hamon had neglected her while his wife was In Ardmore last summer. About tnis time she came to Tucson and visited us for a short while. She was a very pretty woman. She showed plainly that she was dissatisfied with her life. On one occasion she showed me an automatic pistol which she carried in her grip and told me she had always kept it with her for protection. Got Mail ag Mrs. Hamon. " 'While we were in Tucson Frank's mother, Mrs, Bessie Hamon, lived at our home several months. I loved her as my own mother, but she appeared to resent my having married Frank. " 'Prior to coming to live with us, Frank's mother had visited Jake Ha mon and Clara Smith Hamon in Okla homa City. In talking to me about her sojourn there she declared that Jake wanted her to remain with them as housekeeper. " 'In August, 1919, my husband went to Ardmore and Jake Hamon gave him a job in the oil fields. He wrote to me to come out and join him, but when Jake heard that I was coming he told him, so Frank says, to clear out and never come herewith that woman. Later Frank told me that Clara Smith was rectlving mail under my name and was using it generally to avoid sus picion, and that a second Mrs. Frank Louis Hamon in the community might cause as. lot of trouble. Nephew Now Disappeared. " 'Shortly after my. husband came back from Ardmore his mother bought the St. Elmo' ranch, a few miles from Vacaville, and 1 came here to live with Frank's ; brother Raymond and his wife.

"Yes, he will come," he declared when asked if Constantine would re turn to Greece. "We probably will notify him on Wednesday." When the Earl of Granville, the British minister here, visited Premier Rhallis early this week to hand, him the latest British communication, the latter smiled and exclaimed: "What, you have come with a new note? 1 have not answered the other two yet."

CASTOR I A For Infants and Children In Use For Over 30 Years Always bears the Signature of comes to the Grand two Xlghts, with PAY LITTLE HEED President's Message Makes Slight Dent on Congress. Agree Reconstruction Seeded at Once Disagree on Method. Washington, Dee. 8. President Wil son's recommendations to congress are to be dismissed with scant attention by Republican leaders, they made plain today in informal discussion of the message read to the two houses yes terday. The Republicans said, in effect, that while they agree with Wilson that the reconstruction job should be tackled and finished as soon as possible, there is no hope of agreeing with him as to the methods to be followed. One exception was noted in the gen' eral rejection of the president's request for immediate action. This was the budget bill, which is scheduled to pass the senate soon and go to Wilson. Tax revision will be deferred. There is a strong feeling that something should be done for the disabled sol diers and sailors, but that, too, will have to wait, according to the present plans. Governmental economy cannot be brought about fully until govern mental reorganization is accomplished under the next administration, leaders maintained. The recommendation for a loan to Armenia was scouted on all sides. There is a wide variance of opinion regarding Philippine inde r,Andence. . Th ,wa Wilson has twice asked to regulate cold storage again will fail to pass, it was declared. His proposal to license all concerns doing an Inter state business was labelled as "social istic" or "paternalistic." ,
