Cottonwood Is seeking county di vision on such linos as will make that ambitious city the county cap ital, and It Is said has for months and months been setting Its triggers and shaping Its ends to that pur purpose. Last Saturday evening a delegation consisting of George M. Robertson and G. F. McKinney met a gather ing of Grangeville citizen« at the former's request at the Inland Ab stract compamy's oMloe In this city for the purpose of presenting Cotton wood's views and wishes In the ;prem Ires. The visitors .were very court eous and genteel In their discussion of the matter, both of them being gentlemen, as well as business men of experience, and they were receiv ed by the local representation in the same spirit, although to quite a num ber of those present the proposition -came as somewhat of a surprise, and they were hardly willing to believe that the visitors were really in earn est In their statement of Cotton wood's desire« and expectations. 'As a matter of course Grangeville "would object most seriously to divis ion of Idaho county upon the lines proposed, at the meeting held, as this town would be cut off with ■ about five township« of prairie coun try, and the forest .reserve, mountains •■and mines, the boundary of the pro posed new county coming to within about six miles of Grangeville on the <we»t and a like distance on the north. This view of the .matter was made plain, to the visitors. "The boundaries of the proposed new •county, which Is to be christened '"Randall." after Lieutenant D. B. Randall, killed in the Nez Perce war In 1877, commences at a point on CSoake river on the line 'between town isttps 28 and 29 north, Intersecting ■»aid river; thence east on Salmon river and down «old river to Rocky Canyon; thence up said canyon to a joint where the canyon crosses range t, 2 east; thence north to Cotton wood creek; thence down said creek to the South Fork of the Clearwater river; thence down the river to the mouth of Lawyer'» canyon; thence up Lawyers' canyon to the northwest corner of township 32, range 1 west, Boiae meridian, thence west 12 miles into Nez Perce county; thence south to Snake river; thence up Snake riv er to ihte place of beginning. TThla would divide the town of ; ; Sttoss and also Kooskia In the mid , die,> leaving part of each in Idaho county, and taking the other portions -over Into the new division, and would include the towns of Cottonwood,Win vona, Greencreek, Ferdinand, West lake and Keuterville. No arrange ment for a future meeting was made with the visitors, who returned home on the moaning train. „ . ... I Last spring Gov. Brady fired. Church from the state tend bawd for : allying himself with an outside cor poration as land attorney while still acting for the state a* secretary of the land board. Gov. Brady was at the time a candidate for re-election. and enemies then took up the hue mdcry that the Governor was simply ■ the galleries for vote«, ylayimg to Did that he had «acrificed Church to ! kis unholy ambitions. Last week he i tailed Bank Examiner Cruee onto the carpet for connection with a fall- ; ing bank to the relation of a borrow er of funds and for failure to give proper examination and publicity to the bank's condition, and decapitat ed him instanter. Since the first mentioned Gov. Brady has j instance ..... Heen defeated for reelectlan, and the -'«im« of hto enemies to the j Church case had no little to do with his defeat, for they rang the changes j on it, the state oyer, running the gamut and repeating, and finally got a number of people to believe It. As Mr. Brady is not running for of fice mow, he probably fired Cruse through pure bloodthirsttoese, or pos sibly he wanted to vent his spleen on someone because of his defeat; or happy thought, can It be that he still has designs upon the office of 8 enter Borah, as has 'been heretofore charg ed against him? It woultl not do to charge collusion between Mr. Brady and oGv.-Elect Hawley,for that would Implicate the latter gentleman. No more will It do to credit Gov. Brady with any honorable, upright motive In any of his acts; or any desire or good impulse toward the right, or any wish or purpose ito work In the in terest» of the people or for the better ment or advancement of the public weal. So It has been written. THE

THAT HARRY ORCHARD MATTER. In discussing the story that has been ao diligently circulated through out the state to the effect that Harry Orchard was to be jiarolled and pos sibly pardoned, Gov. Brady speaks di rectly to the point when he says: "Such a thing as pardoning or par oling Harry Orchard has never been considered for a moment by any mem ber of the pardon board. I have per sonally talked to Warden. Snook and I know that he feels the same rela tive to the matter that I do, and I do not believe that any executive of Idaho will ever for a moment con sider the pardoning of Harry Orch ard. The law also specifically states that one under life sentence cannot be paroled. Harry Orchard Is in the Idaho penitentiary and In my judg ment will remain there the rest of bis life." To which Warden John W, Snook, add»: "Orchard get* the same treatment as any other prisoner In my charge, neither better nor worse. The state ment that there has ever at any .time been any talk of either pardon ing or paroling him I» absurd and is Just about the laat thing the board, would In my judgment think of do ing." In the history of the world no man ever stood for principle which had for its purpose the uplift of hu manity who was. not traduced, ma 1'gned and lied about, truthfully stat es the Salmon Recorder. In stand ing for cleanliness In daily life of the individual, or for civic righteousness a person I» bound to step on the toes of some one who would havenore straint placed upon, their actions or their duty to their country and their fellowman. This may be the rock I upon which socialism may be wreck ^ ^ , deals are so high that the : ^ of humanily mvl8t b<1 reflm . d vMed before 8U< _ h Weal After all the fuss and feathers about the jiaroling of Harry Orchard. It ■ turns out to be an hallucination of the mortal mind, superinduced by an over government can exist. ! weening desire to tell a few more on i the Brady administration before the governor retires. If the Lord should ; strike the liar dumb as he deserves, there would be a stillness In Idaho that wou ld be heard the worl d over, To be exact, Your Uncle Samuel's family now number» 91, 972, 266, and j with the 9.127,774 footer children on he counts his Island possessions, j hl« progeny over the 101.100,000 mark Getting to be quite a husky nation j these piping days. TWO GAMES BASKET BALL. On last Friday night there were two basket ball oontests indulged iln at the Armory. The first was be tween two girl teams from thehigh school, which was followed with deep Interest, the game resulting in a score of 5 to 3 dn favor of one side, just which one, or what one, it would be hard to state. Suffice It ts say, that the girls clearly established the fact that they were no novices dn the intricacies of the game. The second game was between the Grangeville high school team and the town team, and was a »nappy, In teresting game all the way through, The town team laid it over the youngsters from the educational fac tory by a score of 8 .to 4, which makes honors even, the high school bunch having won the previous con test on a count of 7 to 13. The .high school team will go over to Nez Perce next Saturday to meet the hdgh school players of that Tit tle olty, and it Is understood that they are going up against a strong combination. -<) RECEIVE WARM WELCOME. L. M. Harris, wife and three sons, Harold, Lee and Basil, arrived last Thursday evening and will remain until after Christmas visiting Mr. Harris' sister, Mrs. R. J. Dunn, and brother, George Harris, north of town and numerous friends In Vllllsca and vicinity. Mr. Harris was a candidate for the office of county auditor and clerk during the late campaign, but was defeated by his competitor by Mr. Harris says next to getting elected he Is perfectly sat isfied. He won't admit it, but the Review thinks it very likely that the women polled a strong vote for the other fellow because he was better looking. Mr. Harris has always been popular with the ladles, but he never before had; tested them when It came to voting him Into office. By the by. It. seems good to see him and his family in a good state once more. —Vllllsca Review. 171 votes. SEND PRIZE HOG TO UNIVER8ITY No mean Insinuation meant by this.
