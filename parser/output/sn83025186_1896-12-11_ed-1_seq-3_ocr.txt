Washington, D. 0., Dec. 7.—Presi dent Cleveland to-day transmitted bis annual message to congress. Con densed, It is as follows: Congress of the United States: —Aa representatives of the people in the legislative branch of their govern­ ment, you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence or our free institutions and the fitness of our citisens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest Involving momentous conse quences, fraught with feverish appre henslon, and creating aggressiveness mo Intense aa to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged througn out our land, and determined by the decree of free and independent suf frage, without disturbance of our tran quility or the least sign of weakness In our national structure. When we con sider these Incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly sub mission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions, we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide ••'v by every verdict of the popular will, Kpnd to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith In the agencies estab llshed for the direction of the affairs iVr of their government. Thus our people /7-,'..exhibit a patriotic disposition, which ^entitles them to demand of those who -undertake to make and execute their Jlaws such faithful and unselfish ser „j«vlce in their behalf as can only be ^"prompted by a serious appreciation of a. the trust and confidence which the ac ^ceptance of public duty invites. J?V\ In obedience to a constitutional re *4 quirement I herein submit to tho con ..sreem certain Information concerning ^national affairs with the suggestion of •f such legislation as In my judgment is ."^necessary and expedient. To secure "brevity and avoid tiresome narration, I '/shall omit many details concerning 4 matters within federal control which, though by no means unimportant, are vitnore profitably discussed in depart- Omental reports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omit vtlng a minute recital of many minor Incidents connected with our foreign relations which have heretofore found 'a place in executive messages but are now contained in a report of the Treas ury of State. 1 

ARMENIAN AFFAIRS.

SPAIN AND CUBA* A Difficult Problem. The insurrection in Cuba still con i". tintfes with all its perplexities. It Is ^difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward the pacification of the Island or that the Situation of affairs as depicted In my feflast annual message has In the leapt ^Improved. If Spain BtiU holds Havana H««nd the seaports and all the consider fefabUf towns, the insurgents still roam at litwill over at least two thirds of the Inland country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seemsbut to strengthen wllh tho lapse of time, and is evinced by her unhesi (oaStatlng devotion of largely Increased ®mllltary and has ernment to naval forces to the task, there Is much reason to believe, that the Insurgents have gained in point of numbers, and character, and resources, and are none the less inflexible in their tesolve not to succumb, without prac tically securing the great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her author ity, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on, the pretense that civil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain- is able to main tain it, has been practically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a gov ernment, more or less Imperfectly, in the large towns and their Immediate suburbs. But, that exception being made, the entire country is either gg-iiven over to anarchy or is subject &m*o the military occupation of one or the other party. Calls It a ^Government oa Paper." Tt Is reported. Indeed, on reliable authority, -that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent army, the putative Cuban government now given up sail attempt to ex ercise Its functions,' leaving that gov confessedly (what there Is the be»t. reason tor supposing it always, mm been in fact) a govern- ment ipereiy on paper. Were the Spar.- armies able to meet their anUgo ulsts In the open or ln^ pitched battle, tad dcdslve results might be for, and ihe immense supmor fih forces In humhen, ipment, couid hardly But thejr are called upon to face that shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose ttt own ground, that from the nature of .the country Is visible or Invisible at pleas ure, tnd that fights only from ambus* cade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on Its aluo. In a country where all that Is Indis pensable to life-In the way of food, clothing and shelter Is so easily ob tainable, especially by those born and bred on the soil, It is obvious that there Is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as In all cases of protracted civil strife, the passions of the combatants grow more ana more inflamed and excesses on botn sides become more frequent and more deplorable. They are also participated in by bands of marauders who now In the name of one party and now in the name of the other as may best suit the occasion, harry the country at will and plunder its wretched inhabi tants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail, immense destruction of proper ty even If It were the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as prac ticable. But while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish gov­ ernment, it has now apparently aband oned It and Is acting upon the same theory as the insurgent?, namely: that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property that it may not prove of use and ad vantage to the enemy. Decay of Cuban Industry. It Is to the same end that in pur suance of general orders Spanish garri sons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural population required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result would seem to be that the Industrial value of the is land is fast diminishing, and that un less there is a speedy and radical change in existing conditions it will soon disappear altogether. That value consists very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugar—a capacity already much reduced by the Interrup tions to tillage which have taken place during the last two years. It Is re liably asserted that should these inter ruptions continue during the current year and practically extend, as is now threatened, to the entire sugar pro ducing territory of the island so much time and so much money will be re quired to restore the land to its nor mal productiveness that It is extremely doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining coun try. by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe, would en gage the serious attention of the gov ernment and the people of the Up I ted States In any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with which is by no means of a wholly senti mental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly sep arated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest In it is second only to that of the people and government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least from $30,000,000 to $50,000, 000 of American capital are invested In plantations and in railroad, mining and other business enterprises on the island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which i|i 1880 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose In 1803 to about $103,000,000, and In 1S94. the year before the present Insurrec tion broke out, amounted to nearly $96, 000,000. Besides this largo pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself Inextricably involved in the present contest in other ways both vexatious and costly. Filibustering Expeditions. Many Cubans reside In this country and Indirectly promote the insurrec tion through the press, by public meet ings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and by tvhich the spirit of our Kecocnition Not Sow I'o»hII»1c. It was at first proposed that bellig erent rights should be accorded to the insurgents—a proposition no longer urged because untimely and in prac tlcll operation clearly perilous and in jurious to our own Interests. It has since been and is now sometimes con tended that the Independence of the in surgents should be recognized. But im. nerfect and restricted as the Spanish government of the Island may be. no other exists there—unless the will of tho military officer in temporary com mand of a particular district can be (ll?nilied as a species of government. It Is now also suggested that the Uni ted States should buy the island—a suggestion possibly worthy of consid eration if there were any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is urged, finally, that, all other meth ods falling, the existing internecine strife in Cuba should be terminated by our Intervention, even at the cost of a war between the Uhlted States and Spain—a war which its advocates con fidently prophesy could be neither large in Its proportions nor doubtful in its issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has nevertheless a character to maintain as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the rule of its con duct. Saya Tliat Wo Should Rcapect Spain. Further, though the United States Is not a nation to which peace is a neces sity, it is in truth the most pacific of powers, and desires nothing so much aa to live in amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified domaliw satisfy all possible longings for terri tory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and prevent any casting of covetous eyes upon neighboring regions, how ever attractive. That our conduct to ward Spain and her dominions has constituted no exception to this nation al disposition. Is made manifest by the course of our government, not only thus far during the present insurrec tion, but during the ten years that fol lowed the rising at Yara In 1868. No other great power, it may safely be said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested the same restraint,and the same patient endurance. It may also be said that this per sistent attitude of the United States toward Spain in connection with Cuba, unquestionably evinces no slight respeet and regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They In truth do npt forget her connection with the discov ery of the western hemisphere, nor-do they underestimate the great cfloalltlee of the Spanish people., nor -fall to fuuy recognise their splendid patriotism and tfaelr chivalrous devotion to the na tional honor. They view with wondei and admiration the cheerful resolution wKIt wticfa vast bodies of men are sent thousands of miles and Is #58 costly poMtMlon of tht I®® |__ 1 ernment nor the people BMtes have shut their l.ii«d course of evenU In Cuba or have f«ii«j to realise the existence of conceded '"^rr.v.ii.ato the pres- Negotiations ror a treaty frlerevolthfrom ent authority, —grievance* recognised by the «ueen regent and by the cortcs, voiced SV^ iChththe h^fuhority Facing such circumstances to with hold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them put them selves at mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance of neg lecting the gravest of perils and invit ing suspicion as to the sincerity of any professed willingness to grant reform. The objection on behalf of the Insurg ents—that promised reforms cannot be relied upon must of course be consid ered, though we have no right to as sume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done ac cording to both the spirit and the let ter ot the undertaking. institutions and the tefePfiof our towa., account, that the Cuban problem should do not permit to *5 made the subject of criminal prosecutions. o*jne of them, though CjtKans at heart and ln-all their feelinggand interests hgvelakenT&Ut, papers as naturalized elnons of the tftflted States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection by this government, and npt unnaturally regarded with much Indignation by the country of their origin. The Insur gents are undoubtedly encouraged and supported by the widespread sympathy the people of this country always and Inf-tlnctively feel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which, In the case of the more adven turous and restless elements of our pop ulation I?ads In only too many In stances to active participation In the contest. The result Is that this gov ern'fflent^~t«-oonat«U^„jsalled upon to protect American citizens to claim HaTn ages for injuries to persons and prop erty now estimated at many millions of dollars and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts of Spanish offi cials whose zeal for the repression of rebellion sometimes blinds them to the immunities belonging to the unoffend ing citizens of a friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States is compelled to actively police along the line of sea-coast against unlawful expeditions, the es cape of which the utmost vigilance will not always suffice to prevent. These inevitable entanglements of the United Stated wltlT the rebellion In Cuba the laree American property interests af fected and considerations of philan thropy and humanity In general, have led to a vehement demand In various Quarters for some sort of positive Inter ventlon on the part of the United States. Our Offer to Spain. Nevertheless, realizing that suspi cions and precautions on the part of the weaker of two combatants are al ways natural and not always unjusti fiable—being sincerely desirous, in the Interest of both as well as on its own be solved with the least .possible delay —It was Intimated by/tnls government to the government of Spain some monthP prgo that, If a satisfactory meSSfortT of home ruic were tendered the Cuban insurgents, and would be ac cepted by them upon a guaranty of its execution, the United States would en deavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing etioh guaranty. While no definite response to this Inti mation has yet been received from the. Spanish government, It is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while, as already suggested, no reason Is per ceived why It should not be approved by the Insurgents. Neither party can fail to see the Importance of early ac tion, and both must realize that to pro long the present state of things for pvfn.a short period will add enormous ly to the time Aim lat»ui and ture necessary to bring about the in dustrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore, fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breech between Spain and the in surgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may be at once inaugurated and pushed to an immediate and suc cessful issue. The friendly offices ot the United States, either in the man ner above outlined or in any other way consistent with our constitution and laws will always be at the disposal of either partv. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our Interests would constrain us to object to the ac quisition of the island or an Interfer ence with its control by any o»ner power. If Spain Fall*. It should be added that it cannot be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be Indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict in all its features, and properly apprehend our Inevitably close relations to it, and its possible results, withoui consider ing that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition, as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and In her own way, or with our friend ly co-operation. When tho inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection has become manifest, and it is demonstrated that her sovereign ty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of Its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for Its re-establish ment has degenerated Into a strife which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will lie presented In which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which Ave can hardly hesitate to recog nize arid discharge. Deferring the choice of ways and methods until the time for action ar rives, we should make them depend upon the precise conditions than exist ing and they should not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration Involving our honor and Interest, or the International duty we owe to Spain. Until wie face the contingencies suggested, or the sit uation is by other Incidents Impera tively changed, we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus in all circumstances exhibiting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position we occupy in the family of nations. A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation either through a care less disregard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and Ill-timed ex pression of feeling. But I.have deemed it not amiss to remind the congress .that a time may arise when a correct policy and care for our Interests as well as a regard for the interests of other nations and their citisens joined by considerations of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile coun try, intimately related to us saved from complete devastation will con strain our government to suoh action as will subserve the Interests thus in volved and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an oppor tunity to enjoy the blessings of peace.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. Treaauiy Receipt*, Etc. The seoretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, the receipts of tho government, from all sources, amounted to 408.78. subjects—there should be no Just reason why the pacification of the island might not be efected on that basis. Such a result would ap­ pear to be in the true Interest of ail concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the Island, and making it worthless for whichever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep in tact the possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be. consulted rather than impugned, by the adequate redress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosper ity of the Island and the fortunes of its Inhabitants within their own con trol, without severing the natural ana ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable them to test their capacity for self government under the most favorable conditions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain should not promise autonomy until her Insurgent subjects lay down their arms. But the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain, of unconditional surrender on the part of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy Is conceded, Is not altogether apparent. It Ig nores Important features of the situation—the stability two years duration has given to tho insurrec tion the feasibility of its Indefinite prolongation in the nature of things, and as shown by past experience: the utter and Imminent ruin of the island, unless the present strife Is speedily composed above all. the rank abuses which all parties In Spain, all branches of her government and all her leading public men concede to exist and pro fess a desire to remove.

POSTAL AFFAIRS. The Annual Deficit, Ktc. Our postofllce department is in good condition, and the exhibit made of its operations during the fiscal year end ed June 30, 1895, if allowance is made for imperfections In the laws applic able to it. Is very satisfactory. The to tal receipts during the year were $82, 499,208.40. The total expenditures were $90,626,296.84, exclusive of $1,559,898.27, which was earned by the Pacific rail road for transportation and credited on their debt to the government. There was an increase of receipts over the previous year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent, and an increase of expenditures of $3,836,124.02, or 4.42 per cent. The de ficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that of the preceding year. The chief expendi tures of the postal service are regulated by law arid are not In the control of the postmaster-general. All that he can ac complish by the most watchful admin istration and economy is to enforce prompt and thorough collection and ac counting for public moneys and such minor savings in small expenditures and in letting those contracts, for post office supplies and star service, which are not regulated by statute. An ef fective co-operation between the audi tors' officeandthe postoffice department and the making and enforcement of orders by the department requiring im mediate notification to their sureties of all delinquencies on the part of post masters and compelling such postmas ters to make more frequent deposits of postal funds have resulted in a promp ter auditing of their accounts and much less default to the government than heretofore. The year's report shows large extensions of both star route servlcc and railway-mall serv ice, with increased postal facilities. Much higher accuracy in handling mails has also been reached, as ap pears by the decrease of errors In the railway mail service and the reduc tion of mall matter returned to the dead letter office. The deficit for the last year, although much less than that of the last and preceding years, em phasizes the necessity for legislation to correct the growing abuse of second class rate£ to which the deficiency Is mainly attributable. The transmission at the rate of one cent a pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets, "house organs" (periodicals advertising some particular "house" or Institution) sam ple copies, and the like, ought certain ly to be discontinued. A glance at the revenues received for the work done last year will show more plainly than any other statement, the gross abuse of the postal service and the growing waste of its earnings: The free matter carried in the mails for the department, offices, etc., of the government, and for congress, in pounds, amounted to #4,480,189. be in a manner highly satis­ factory. It has been decided, however, to provide In every shlp-bulldlng con tract that tho builder should pay all trial expenses, and It has also been de termined to pay no speed premiums in future contracts. The premiums re cently earned and some yet to be de cided are features of the contracts made before this conclusion was re&chcd. On March 4, 1893, there were In com mission but two armored vessels, the double-terreted Monitors, Miantono moh and Monterey. Since that date^of vessels theretofore authorized there have been placed in their first commis sion three first-class and *wo second class battleships, two armored cruisers, one harbijr-defense ram and five double turreted Monitors, including the Maine and the Puritan, iust completed. Eight new unatmored cruisers and two new gun-boats have alio been commission ed. The Iowa, another battleship will be completed about March 1. and at least four more gunboats will be leady for sea in the early spring. It is gratifying to state that our ships and their outfits are believed to be equal to the best that can be inan ufactured elsewhere, and that such no table reductions have been made in their cost as to Justify the statement that quite a number of vessels are now being constructed at rates as low as those that prevail in European s.hlp- yOur manufacturing facilities arc at this time ample for all possible naval contingencies.

The diminution of our ^nums pen sion roll and the dccrease of pension ex penditure which have been „«o often confidently foretold, still fan inJJiat®rl al realization. The number of pension ers on the rolls at the close of the fiscal vear. ended June 30, 1896. was 970,678. This*-Is the largest number ®ve.1 ed. The amount paid exclusively for the pensions during the year was $w5, 214,761.94, slight decrease from that o£ the preceding year, while the total ex penditures on account of pensions, in cluding the cost of maintaining the de partment and expenses attending pen sion distribution amounted to $14-,206, 550.59. or within a very small fraction of one-third of the entire expense of supporting the government during the same year. The number of new pen sion certificates Issued was 90,640. Of these, 40,374 represent original allow ances^ of claims and 15,878 Increases of cxlmfig pensions. The number of persons receiving pen sions from the United States, but re siding in foreign countries at the close of the last fiscal year, was 3,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was $582,735.38. The sum appropriated for the pay mciit or-pensions rui tiie-corrent nBCal year ending June 30, 1897, Is $40,000, 000, and tor thes ucceedlng year it is estimated that the same amount will be necessary. Civil Service Heforni. The progress made In civil service reform furnishes a cause for the ut most congratulation. It has survived the doubts of Its friends as well as the rancor of its enemies and has gained a permanent placc among the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and to Improve, economize s£nd elevate the public service. There are now In the competitive classified service upward of eighty-four thousand places. More than half of these have been Included from time to time since March 4, 1893. A most radi cal and sweeping extension was made by executive order dated the 6th day of May, 1896, and If fourth class post masterships are not included In the statement it may be said that practical ly all positions contemplated by the civil service law are now classified. Abundant reasons exist for including these postmastershlps, based upon economy, improved service and the peace and quiet of neighborhoods. It, however, obstacles prevent such ac tion at present, I earnestly hope that congress will, without Increasing post office appropriations, so adjust them as to permit In proper cases a consolida tion of these postofiices, to the end that through this process the result desired may to a limited extent be accom plished. 

TARIFF AND FINANCES. I desire to recur to the statement.8 elsewhere made concerning the govern ment's receipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operation. This statute took effect on the 28th day of August, 1894. Whatever may be Its shortcomings as a complete measure of tariff reform, It must be conceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of commodities between us and other countries, and thus furnished a wider markets for products and manu facturing. The only entire fiscal year during which this law has been In force ended on the 30th day of June, 1896. In thnt year our imports increased over those of the previous year more than $6,500. 000, while the value of the domestic products we exported, and which found markets abroad, was nearly $70,000,000 more than during the preceding year. Those who Insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful U8e should only be Increased through tariff charg es to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the government, as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and with the additional purpose of no Increasing their price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and producers better and more profitable opportunities, must agree that our tar iff laws are only primarily Justified as Sources of revenue to enable the gov ernment to meet the necessary ex penses of-, its maintenance. Considered is to Its efficiency In this aspect, the present law can by no means fall un der just .condemnation. During the .only complete fiscal tion year It of'Its has opera­ yielded nearly $9,000,000 more revenue than was recelved from tariff duties In the" preceding- year. There was, nevertheless, a deficit be tween our receipts and expendltQres Sf a little more than 925,000,000. This, however, was not unexpected. Qaaetloa of Ifmit. .The government thus applying a sur plus fortunately In Its treasury to the It# current revenues, Is not at all to be likened to a man living beyond his In come and thus incurring debt or en croaching on his principal. It is not one of the functions^ of our government to accumulate and make additions to a fund not needed for Im mediate expenditure. With Individuals It Is the chief object of struggle and effort. The application of an accumu lated ^und-by -the government to payment of its running expenses duty. the Is Financial I.eglilatlon Reoommenuea. This reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues naturally suggests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods. They have been frequently pressed up on the attention of congress In previous executive communications and the In evitable danger of their continued tol eration pokited out. Without now re peating these details, I cannot refrain from again earnestly presenting the necessity of the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance and shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and per plexity. The terrible civil war which shook the foundations of our govern ment more than thirty years ago brought in its train the destruction of property, the wasting of ou coun try's substance, and the estrangement of brethren. These are now past ana forgotten. Even the distressing loss of life the conflict entailed is but a sacred memory, which fosters patriotic senti ment and keeps alive a tender regard for those who nobly died. And yet there remains with us to-day In full strength and activity as an Incident of that -emendous struggle, a feature of Its ,ancial necessities, not only unsulted to our present circumstances, but mani festly a disturbing menace to business security and an ever-present agent of monetary distress. Because we may be enjoying a tem porary relief from its depressing in fluence, this should not lull us Into a false security nor lead us to forget the suddenness of past visitations. I am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured financial peace and safety until the government cur rency obligations upon which gold may bo demanded from tho treasury are withdrawn from circulation and can celled. This might be done, as has been heretofore recommended by their ex change for long term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or by their redemp tion with the proceeds of such bonds. Even if only United States notes known as greenbacks were thus retired it is probable that the treasury notes is sued in payment of silver purchases under the act of July 14, 1890, now paid In gold when demanded would not create much disturbance as they might from time to time when received the treasury by redemption In gold otherwise be gradually and prudent replaced by silver coin. This plan ot issuing bonds for the purpose of re demption certainly appears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform. In itfy In default of this, however, it would be a step in the right direction if cur rency obligations redeemable in gold, whenever so redeemed, should be can celled instead of being reissued. This operation would be a slow remedy, but it would Improve present condition. National banks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to issue circulation to the par value of bonds deposited as security for its re tirement of United States notes an-i demption, and the tax on their clrcu treasury notes Issued under the law lation should be reduccd to one-fourth cf one per cent. In considering projects for the re tirement of United StateB notes and treasury notes issued under the law of J890, I am of the opinion that we have placed too much stress upon the danger of contracting the currency and have calculated too little upon the gold that would bo added to our circulation if Invited to us by letter and safer financial methods. It is not so much a contraction of our currency that should be avoided as Its unequal dis tribution. This.might be obviated and any fear of harmful contraction at the same time removed, by allowing the organi zation of smaller banks and In less populous communities than are now permitted, and also authorizing existing banks to establish branches in small communities under proper restrictions. Another topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest may liere be briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and other huge aggregations of capital, the object of which is to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, in dustry or commerce, and so stifle wholesomG— competition, Wlien these lire OeTended it 's usually on the ground that though they Increase profits they also reduce prices, and thus may bene fit the public. It must be remembered, however, that a reduction of prices to the people is not one of the real objects of these organizations, nor is their tendency necessarily in that direction. It it occurs In a particular case It. Is onlv because it accords with the pur pose or interest of those managing the scheme. TruHtfl Got a Koast. Such occasional results fall far short of compensating the palpable evils charged to the account of trusts and monopolies. Their tendency is to crush out Individual independence and to hin der or preventt he free use of human faculties and tho full development of human character. Through them the farmer, the artisan and the smalls trad er Is in danger of dislodgment from the proud position of being his own master, watchful of all that touches his coun^ try's prosperity, In which he has an In dividual lot and Interested In all that affects the advantages of business of which he Is a factor, to be relegated to the level of a mere appurtenance to a great machine, with little free will, with no dutv but of passive obedience, and with little hope of opportunity of rising In the scale of responsible and helpful citizenship. To the instinctive belief that such is the inevitable trend of trusts and mo nopolies is due tho widespread and deep-seated popular aversion in which they are held and the not unreasonable Insistence, that whatever may be their Incidental economic advantages, their general effect upon personal character, prospects and usefulness can not be otherwise than injurious. Though congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but simply because the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the Insufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation it should be done. The fact must be rec ognized, however, that all federal leg islation on this subject may fall short of Its purpose because of Inherent ob stacles and also because of the complex character of our governmental system. It does not follow, however, that this Is the limit of the remedy that may be applied. Even though it may be found that federal authority Is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the power of the several states to act effectively In the premises, and there should be no rea son to doubt their willingness to judi ciously exercise such power. In concluding this communication, Its last words shall bo an appeal to the congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the money it holds In trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagance Is easy, but I return to frugality Is d'fficult.
