It is an effective instrument as it stands and has been fully inter- : : -j preted by the courts. If the country should I embark, as some suggest, on the unknown X sea of fad legislation, mostly of a semi socialistic character, that would mean inevit _^_ ably a lengthened period of litigation to ascertain the meaning of the empirical rules that have been proposed with more or less good intention. Under the present interpretation of the Sherman law no com bination of honest or beneficial purpose can be attacked or molested as suggested byway of hypothesis by opponents of the law. Mr. Taft replies: The answer to this hypothetical case is that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable them to suppress com petition, control prices and establish a monopoly, they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having it clearly in mind. If what they do is merely for the purpose'of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of suppressing competition by use of the bigness of the plant they are creating, then they can not be con victed at the time the union is made, nor can-they be convicted later, unless it happen that later on they conclude to suppress competition and take the usual methods' for doing so, and thus establish for themselves a | monopoly. They can, in such a case, hardly complain if the motive X which subsequently i*-" disclosed is attributed by the court to the original combination. j President Taft on the Trust Problem i Let the law stand. If necessary, it may be supplemented, as the president suggests, by a legal definition of unfair methods in competition. In order to secure uniformity of action the congress is advised that a federal incorporation law governing interstate com merce be enacted. The purpose of such a measure, of course, would be to avoid the diversity and conflict of law due to the legislation of the several states. With such supplemental legislation the Sherman law would be brought to its highest efficiency. That law, as Mr. Taft says, is the "expression of the effort of a freedom loving people to preserve equality of opportunity. It is the result of the confident deter mination of such a people to maintain their future growth by pre serving uncontrolled and unrestricted the enterprise of the individual, his industry, his ingenuity, his intelligence, and his independent courage." 

NOTHING stands in the way of ratification for the interna tional arbitration treaties propounded by President Taft, but the.United States seriate, which bases its opposition on cer tion petty quibbles. Such is the judgment of Dr. Hamilton Holt, editor of the Xew York Independent, expressed at one of the? Earl lectures delivered in Berkeley..* It might be added, perhaps, that/these technical quibbles ■:he senate are inspired in some, degree by political jealousies. Both houses of congress arc more deeply engaged in politics just now than in the legislation which the country demands. There is no division of sentiment on these treaties anywhere among the people. On a general referendum vote they would be ratified almost unanimously, but there are certain political elements which hate to see Mr. Taft get the credit, for a statesmanlike treat ment of a matter of .worldwide importance. On such petty motives sometimes do great issues hang. As Dr. Holt said Unanimous Sen timent for Peace Treaties If these treaties be ratified, then the United States, through the noble, initiative of President Taft, will have done more for the peace of the world than has ever been done in all history. The treaty is not all that President Taft at first led us to believe, but it is a great'step? in the direction of the goal we seek. , X The matter will come up for action during the? present session of congress and if favorable action is to be secured it is time the constituencies brought pressure to bear on their senators. X Perhaps the most striking feature of Mr. Taft's recent tour of the west-was'the universally favorable attention and interest that attended his addresses on the arbitration treaties. This sentiment was strongly and "influentially manifested in the speeches which the president delivered on? this subject in San Francisco and Los Angeles. 

IDENTIFICATION of voters at the polls is not in any important ? way assisted by the record of their ages 'on the -great register. No man and no election officer is able to guess within twenty years. the age of this or that elector as he or she. may appear in tlie polling booth: No such the age contest or ever, elector as he or may appear in the polling booth. \o guessing contest is ever, in fact, resorted to on election) day. As a matter of "fact and practice the single test ever applied on such occasions is the comparison of'handwritings^W that precaution taken, the penalties for personation are quite sufficient to prevent the commission of this offense. Now it is the fact that certain political elements would be pleased to make voting unpleasant orX disagreeable ; for women -electors. They have gone so far in this interest as to publish offensively -women's ages as recorded on the great ? register^ The •single purpose is to annoy the women voters and discourage regis tration. Doubtless this weapon or means of annoyance would come into common practice by unscrupulous publications seeking thereby to accomplsh a political end. The statesmen in the legislature who arc so busy-promoting th inform of annoyance without any sound? reason fur the "require No Need to Record Women's Ages EDITORIAL PAGE OF THE CALL It All Depends on the Point of View ment will doubtless be kept in mind by the women when they come to vote. The provision on which certain legislators insist is wholly needless and superfluous for any practical purpose other than that of embarrassing people who may be sensitive about their ages and do not care to sec the figures paraded on the front pages of political newspapers. EXPORTS from the Philippines in the last- fiscal year totaled |* $39,778,639. The,imports were $49,833,732, of which a con siderable part was United Statesii government supplies. Apart from these, supplies, this country sold to the island consumers goods worth $4,192,849, Great Britain coming second with $3,523,224. This was the first year when commercial imports from this country exceeded those from Great Britain. It-is not a very large trade that we have with the Philippines, but it improves. Yet it is still trifling when compared with our trade with the Hawaiian group. In this connection some recent estimates of the cost of military occupation of the Philippines are of interest. All sorts of guesses on this subject have been current from time to time. As long ago as 1904 Edward Atkinson put the cost up to that time at; the stupen dous total of $1,200,000,000./ About the same Time Judge Alton Parker, then running for president on an anti-imperialist platform, guessed that the cost might be $670,000,000, but the republicans were of opinion that it. was less-than a quarter of that amount. Politics is no promoter of truth. . Now, it appears, if the war department may be trusted, that all these estimates, the lowest, exceeded the facts. The depart ment puts the cost of military occupation since the treaty of peace was signed at $167,486,403. There are many items of expense not included in this/total and altogether it is evident that the Philippine investment has not yet begun to pay its way. Loss and Gain in the Philippines OXE by one the contentions raised in behalf of fraudulent claim ants to Alaskan coal measures arc being cleared away and it may be hoped that prosecutions will follow in due course. The United States supreme court has de clared that the process of making dummy entries, either by power of attorney or other wise, is a fraud on the United States. The Jie United States supreme court has de ircd that the process of making dummy tries, cither by power of attorney or other se, is a fraud on the United States. The decision in this case reverses the ruling of Judge Hanford of the Seattle federal' court, on which the army of fraudulent claimants had rested their hopes for a harvest of plunder. Probably the result of this decision will be, to set aside almost everything in the way of coal entries heretofore made in Alaska, and it therefore leaves a clear field for the operation of constructive legislation, which it is hoped 'that congress will enact during the present session, if it can spare the time from politics. The whole Pacific coast unanimously demands such legislation and 'until it is enacted the development of the great resources of Alaska apart from gold mining and the;fisheries must remain at a standstill. President Taft favors a leasing system on liberal terms to encourage enter :. - ■ m -A*.-- «■ r "*.' -■■ -■" -r* * *".-■*' ■-*--"- '•■"'-* ■.---.■-'■.■"■'■.■..'■ -■.-':,.---• ' ,v. . , -*.C*. -.*r*;,. -, .*.« :.-.% prise while at the same time paying due regard to conservation.

OBSTACLES in the way of the construction of tunnels in this C 1 city under the district-assessment plan appear to have been ' cleared away by Judge Seawell's second decision in the mat ter of the Stockton street bore. Although an appeal will be taken, Judge Seawell's" judg ment is [regarded; as virtually settling the liti gation.. 'XXX X.".-*.■ 7 •' B The fact that a formal appeal will be filed does not hinder getting.the preliminary work out of the way. The appeal will be expedited in the supreme court and it is expected that the matter can be finally adjudicated in a few weeks: \ Press \ Forward Work on City Tunnels ■, In this i view proceedings should be, set , afoot' without delay on the Stockton street and Twin peaks projects. XPiobably, also, the Fillmore street people* will see fit to take up the plans for opening an easy line of communication with the north end. The fact is that there is a great deal, of this work to be done for the general good of the city and the opening of new residence quarters of easy access. For-the? lack of such means off communication the city has been losing population. EORE'IGN and domestic participation; in the Panama-Pacific if—* exposition has,been?placed under the charge and control of * Frederick J. V, Skiff of Chicago^ who is : expert* authority on exposition management. Mr. Skiff has a wide and varied as well as successful "experience in journalism, politics and the preparation of ex hibits, so that he is ; peculiarly well qualified for the responsible position which he has accepted. Mr. Skiff's services in connection with the Chicago and St. Louis world's fairs were especially notable." As chief of the department of mines?and mining for two years he has had another line of experi ence that has supplied him with important qualifications for the office he has assumed at the request of the Panama-Pacific exposition board. Things begin to move in relation to the world's fair and the official preliminaries arc being got out of the way. Shortly the pick and shovel,; the hammer and trowel will be set to work and the dirt will fly. Appointment of World's Fair Official SMILES FOR THE COMMERCE COURT Intermountain Ruling Will Stand In Opinion of Eastern Experts EDWARD CHAMBERS. assistant freight traffic manager of the Santa Fe, who has just returned from the east, states that railroad and business men are particularly Interested in the outcome of the intermountain rate cases which have been referred to the supreme court. 7 "The feeling is general." said Cham bers, "that the commerce court will be sustained in its recent ruling. It up held the right of tlie carriers/to charge less for the haul from the east to 7the Pacific coast : than to interior points. The case will be expedited by the su preme court and we look for a final decision in January." .
