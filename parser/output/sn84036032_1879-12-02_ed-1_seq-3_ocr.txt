New York, Nov. 28.—Iu his Thanksgiving sermon yesterday Beecher said : " We have entered upon a period of prosperity which will run from fifteen to twenty years. What will then be the condition of our country ? The tinkling of cow bells will be heard over mauy portions of the North-West which is now a wilderness. In fifteen years the North ern Pacific Railroad will be finished, and you little know the greatness of the great North West. There are marvels of riches in her breast; she has such grain growing power. Civilization came first out of the tropics, but it was out of the north that strong men came. Nature renews not from the tiopics but from the colder climes. In fifteen years there wiil be Slates where now there is but a howling wild erness, and Canada may be united In mar riage with the United States." Syracuse, N. Y., Nov. 28.—The Marcellus Powder Mill, twelve miles south-west of this city, exploded, destroying three buildings and <1,000 pounds of powder. The report was heard twenty miles distant.

Colorado Springs, Nov. 28.—The annu al meeting of the stockholders of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Company was held here to-day, pursuant to the by-laws and pub lished notice.

Rome, Nov. 28.—Signor Winchera, of the Nicoteras group of deputies, yesterday made an attack on the cabinet iu language so vio lent that he was called to order several times. Among other invectives he asserted that the new ministry was an insult to the Chamber of Deputies and to the country New York, Nov. 28.—The Tribune has an editorial on the Mormon question, from which the following points are gleaned. The time is close at hand when the population of the Territory will be so large that to refuse Utah admission as a State will look like an arbitra ry and unjust departure from well established precedent, and there will be practical incon venience also, in continuing the present method of administration. The Democratic party has for the moment something to gain by the admission of Utah. Two Senators and one Representative to be elected under a State constitution would cer tainly be Democratic. Three electoral votes of the new State would be a gain to the Dem ocratic candidate. If the election of Presi dent be thrown iuto the House, the vote of Utah will count them as much as the vote of New York. It is not to be supposed that the Democrats at Washington are insensible of these conditions. Polygamy cannot be abolished unless it is broken up 'by the National authority while Utah is still a territory. Nobody doubts that under State government crime would be le galized and perpetuated. It is polygamy which erects what is practically a foreign State in the midst of the American continent, ruled by a community which has no sympa thy with the Union, no respect for its laws, no interest in its prosperity. The American people never will consent to the erection ol Utah as a State until the barbarous practice which divides it from the whole Christian world has been forever abolished. And be fore there can be any serious question ot ad mission, laws against polygamy must be mission, against amended and put in force. Louisville, Ky., Nov. 28.—A fearful tor nado played havoc in the southeastern por tion of the city. This morning a terrific gale struck the city at the end of Fourth tsreet, the Rev. Stuart Robinson's house being one of the first to sutter, thence it continued in a north easterly direction through the city to Cass Hill. The south fence of the Central park is all blown down. The old Louisville base ball park is completely riddled, not the least portion of the fence was left standing except half of the east side . The root of the grand stand was smashed iuto kindling wood and blown away. The grounds and street are strewn with broken boards and timber, 'llie ltev. Stuart Robinsgn's bouse is slightly dam aged, about one third of the roof being blown down. . ,, M. S. Fishbaek's carpet beating establish ment on Third street was completely demol ished.

In the southeastern suburbs of German town there was widespread harm done. The tin sheeting on the grocery of Blossford & Co. on the northeast corner of Preston and Broad way, was tom off, a portion of it being carried across the street. Buildings at the corner of Second and Guthrie streets, were served inta similar manner. On Third street, about five miles from the city the storm was very severe. New Orleans, Nov. 28 __Before the com mittee to-day, J. M. Jewett testified as to the contradictory testimony of Houser about Blanchard and himself, relative to their going to Governor Kellogg's house with the returns and working on them there. The reason why the registration books were taken to the Cus tom House was because the evidence to which both parties referred was in the office of the United States Supervisor, and why the regis tration books were taken to the Custom House was for a similar reason. The Supervisor of Registration was Clerk of the Circuit Court and had his office in the Custom House. H. C. Brown, a discharged employe of the Internal Revenue office, testified that Harris Marks told him some time last summer at his private office when they were alone, that he could not take care of any of his own friends whilst this fight was being made on Keilogg ; that he had appointed curs to keep them from squealing on Kellogg. Paul Trevigne, clear ance clerk in the Custom House, testified that Milon came to him very indignant at the ru mor that he (Milon) had made affidavit against Kellogg and got him to wiite a letter to Kellogg denying the rumor. Milon signed the letter which was put In ev idence yesterday. The contrast of signatures showed that Milon did not sign the so-called affidavit. New Orleans, Nov. 28.—J. T. Allyn, Manager of the Western Union Telegraph Company, was recalled. Senator Hill stated that telegrams produced by him before the committee, appeared to belong exclusively to Kellogg. When the witness had been re quested to produce all telegrams to and from Kellogg, the witness answered that he had complied literally with the written demands served upon him, which said all tele grams to Wm. P. Kellogg. Senator Hill then requested the witness to produce all telegrams from Kellogg. Witness replied that it was impossible to do so, as all May and June bus iness had been shipped to New York last Tuesday, by order of Superintendent Merri wether. Senator Hill asked if this had been done to get the dispatches out of the way of the Committee. The witness replied that it might be, as the policy of the company was not to expose the business of its customers if it could be avoided. The Chairman asked if the witness did distinctly understand him to direct the witness to bring all telegrams to and from Kellogg. The witness replied, "ver bally, yes, sir, but your written instructions said only all telegrams to Kellogg." The chairman said he had intrusted the prepara tion of written instructions to Spofford's coun sel. Senator Cameron said that although the witness was no lawyer, he evidently had intelligence enough to know that a written order supercedes all verbal instructions. Chairman—I desire to say to you, Mr. Wit ness, that you escape only under the letter of the law, and you have violated the spirit of law. When the committee returns to Washing ton it will place the matter before the full committee, and will expect the telegraph company to produce those messages Washington, Nov. 29.—The President appointed Major Thomas P. Morgan, at pres ent Superintendent of Police, as District Com missioner to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Seth L. Philips. A special from San Antonio to the Galves ton News, says the Indians are reported de predating the country one hundred miles west of El Paso, Texas. A party of fifteen men went iu pursuit and followed the trial to Can deleria Mountain, when the Indians am bushed them, killing all but one or two. When the news reached the town a strong party organized, and started on the trail, anil when tiiey arrived at the scene of the massa cre commenced to bury the dead. While thus employed they were fired upon and 18 killed. The Indians were apparently armed with Sharpe's Rifles, and are supposed to be fre quenters of the United States reservation. A large force has been organized for the punish ment of the Indians. Washington, Nov. 28.—The Notional to-morrow will publish what , v c i7„i,i,i i,„ ; ! ÄÄ thK i OI C01 • • « Republican to-morrow publish pur ports to be on outline of some of the features contained in Secretary Sherman's forthcoming report. The report was offered for sale on the streets to-night, and it will be printed to morrow in New York, Cincinnati and Chi cago. This fact was brought to the Secretary's attention, but he declined to give out the doc ument for general publication, saying that he would not be a party to any irregularities by which the report was published prior to its presentation to Congress. The Republican will say the forthcoming annual message was made public in a restrict ed and surreptitious manner yesterday. It is said the recommendations contained therein, while they are acknowledged to be of great importance, are so conservative as to avoid attention to any direct shock in financial cir cles or disturbance in commercial affairs. It is understood that the Secretary does not go so far in his recommendations regarding the national currency as the President does in his message, for lie does not suggest an actual retirement of greenbacks. He maintains that the national banking system shall be retained and encouraged as a legitimate aid to the government in supplying currency for the general publie, and also as a legitimate line of personal or private business enterprise ; but he recognizes the necessity and availability of an interehangable currency such as the green back system furnishes, and does not advise any retirement iu the issue ot government notes. The repeal of the legal tender act is dis cussed at length, and it is suggested or recom mended that the effect of the adoption of the suggestion, as explained to the National Re publican by a prominent banker who heard the report yesterday, would be to compel an xplicit understanding in regard to connner greenbacks are now at par, and will remain will naturally be preserved. Mueli of the report is devoted to the details and reports of tire operations of the Treasury âüd itV"sé"erâl W ii'i V 'isions aml "l)iVreaûs, a]l oV ! which have been printed from time to time as ; matters of routine occurrence. , Tlie same paper, in to-morrow's issue, re ferring to its alleged synopsis of the Fresi-| dent's message, which was published yesterday ' morning, will say : "As to tlie omissions in our synopsis there are tlie best of reasons for ! believing that there are several. They refer j to the international exhibition progressing at Melbourne, Australia, tills year, and to be held a- Sidney next year Referring to the 1 exhibit of the U. S. at. Melbourne lie says the ! appropriation therefor was inadequate and suggested llmt. an additional appropriation ' shall Vie made as soon as c mvenientto defray tbe necessary expenses incident to an in creased exhibit at Sidney. Referring to the condition of affairs in Alaska, the President alludes to the appear ance and interference of the British vessel Osteria at Sitka during the troubles in that vicinity last spring and then recommends the immediate establishment of Territorial judi cial? in Alaska. Practically this recommen dation amounts to suggestions for the execu tion of a regular territorial form of govern ment. The reasons advanced to support this suggestion are in effect that the interests of economy will be served by prompt trials of offenders against the laws of the United States in the Territory where their crime maybe committed. Under the present sys tem prisoners and witnesses are transported at great expense to Oregon and California where such trials are now held. This occa sions great delay as weli as expense, both of which would be ayoided by the organization of a local judiciary as suggested. Ex-Senator Ramsey, of Minnesota, is ex pected to arrive here to-morrow. It is gener erally believed he will be nominated to suc ceed Secretary McCrary. Buffalo, Nov. 28. —The body of Thomas Russell, of St. Charles, Mich., a sailor belong ing to the barge Walton, was found floating in Buffi.lo creek this morning, bearing evi dence o;' having been murdered and thrown in. His face and head were horribly disfig ured with some blunt instrument- Captain Andrew McKenzie, of Detroit, master of the barge, has been arrested on suspicion. Los Pinos, Nov. 28. —The portmonie of Mrs. Meeker, containing $31, taken from her by Douglass at the time of her capture, was returned this morning. Douglass sent it in by a runner to Chief Ouray, who delivered it to Agent Adams. All investigation was stopped this morning by runners from the White River Utes, who stated that runnel's from the Uintah Utes say that troops were moving to the Uintah Agen cy to maire prisoners, and that ail the Uintah Utes had left for the camps of the White River Utes, who now refuse to come in until assured that this is not true. The Indians have been informed by the United States that this report is false, and that the troops are instructed not to advance during the present negotiations. An advance of troops would close any further business here. Ouray thinks the story is an invention of the Mormon ele ment who are doing all in their power to cre ate serious trouble. This will delay the com mission six days until the White River Utes return from the Uintah Agency. (Signed) Hatch, Commissioner. Inquiries m official quarters fully confirm Gen. Hatch's assurance to the Indians that the report of the advance of troops is wholly untrue. Secretary Schurz has for some time expected that some adverse element was se cretly at work to retard, or, if possible, defeat the reports of the commission, and he is strongly inclined to believe that the source of the present trouble is correctly indicated by Ouray. Galveston, Nov. 28. —The News says: 'Crescendo Uralte; a Mexican, was hanged to-day in the jail yard ; he fell nine feet, breaking bis neck, and died in seven minutes, He was suspected of infidelity by his wife. One day while washing clothes in a pool his wife came for water; Uralte struck her with a slick, knocking her into the water, holding her under until drowned ; ho then dragged the body out and mutilated it with a knife in a fearful manner. He acknowledged his guilt on the scaffold, exhibiting but little emotion Chattanooga, Nov. 28. —Bennett Jack son was arrested here this morning for snatch ing the body of Tennessee Keith, who died Monday night. The body was packed in a shoebox, and addressed to Atlanta, aud was said to contain fresh fish. Last night some parties attempted to send the same box to Cincinnati as cotton seed. Windsor, Vt.. Nov. 28. —Magoon, when carried to the scaffold and placed in a chair, listened to the reading of the death warrant. He then predicted that within three years tins' would know who killed Streeter. He com plained that injustice had been done him in not being reprieved for a year that the case might be presented to the Legislature and a new trial granted. While speaking he trem bled violently and shed tears. After seating himself he was bound and assisted to the drop by deputies. Atchison, Ks., Noy. 28. —Jay Gould and party arrived in this city last evening and this morning started west over the Central Branch road. This road is now completed to Kyiner, 242 miles west of this city. The Gould party will go to the end of the line and may also inspect some of its branches. There is a great deal of interest throughout a a great this State as to Gould's purposes. He now controls nearly fifteen hundred miles of rail way within the limits of Kansas, or fully one half of the total mileage of the State. The roads that have passed under his control are only lines traversing a large section of the State and the completion of which is practi cally destroyed, lieuce this combination has it in its power to do great injury to Kansas interests or great good as it may elect. The journals of the State are generally reticent in expressing opinions upon the subject, but all manifest the uneasiness almost universally prevalent among the people concerning this gigantic concentration of railway interests in the hands of the combination.
