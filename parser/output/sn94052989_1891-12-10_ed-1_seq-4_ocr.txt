MlttAD OF UECIrr.UITIY. Mr. Blame appears to have set a fashion which the nations of Europe are following one after another. Austria has concluded reciprocity treaties with several of her neighbors, and Spain is preparing an al terrative tariff, with one set of dutie3 for nations which admit Spanish products free of duty or at low duties, and another for nations which tax Spanish products with a view to their exclusion. This is the logical outcome of the tariff war wnicb first broke oat in Europe thirteen years aco. and into which all the nations of that continent were drawn one after the other. It would have I nome sooner or later under any circum stances, but the recent treaty negotiated by the Government at Washington with the Government at Madrid, following on the heels of the recent treaty with Brazil, un doubtedly precipitated matters. It is now announced in the message that the outlines of a new treaty with Germany have been agreed upon establishing recipro cal tariffs in regard to a numbar of articles which the United Slates exchange with Germany, aud notably continuing to admit German sugar to the benefit of the McKin fey Tariff Act on condition th it the Impe rial Eaichstadt reduces by about one-half the duties on American cereals. The ad va:i!s;T- of the treaty will seem to be rather on the side oi Germany. The United State 3 is to an extent interested in extending their markets for cereals, but it Is vital to Ger ninny to get a market into which she can dump her surplus of sugar. For several years Germany has been making more re fined sugar than she could market at a price which left a profit over and above the cost of production, She has been more than once compelled to sell refined sugar in Lon don as low as three* cent 3. If the Industry had been let alono the evil would have cor rected Itself by a reduction in the number and capacity of the German refineries. Un der the operation of the new treaty produc tion will probably be kept up, and the bur plus will come to this country. But the ef fect of that will be to reduce the price of sugar to the American consumer, and for ' this boon vte should be thankful. A new treaty with France, on the line of the treaties with .Spain and Germany, will next be in order. France has for some time been sacrificing the interests of her working class for the benefit of her land-owners. Power now resides in the rural constitu encies, which are jealous of the cities. They insist on laws which, while seeming to seek to advantage the peasantry, really only benefit the great land-owners. Unfor tunately for them this year's short crou has given point to the complaint ot the work- I ingmen in cities, and the Government's hand is forced. It bosun to take the back track OH the pork question; the question of for eign cereals cannot long be delayed. On both the Government at Washington will be prepared to meet them, and the end will ■ probably be a revision of our reciprocal tariff. There will be some obstacles in the way, the chief of which will be in the selec tion of French products that may be ad mitted at lower duties without injury to our industries. The bulk of our importations from France consist of cloths, silks and dress goods; and these the 'Government at Washington would not include in a reci procity arrangement. The people of Canada appear to be very anxious to fall into line, and to negotiate a reciprocity treaty on the lines of the treaty which was in forte lorty years ago. Their wishes do not seem to meet with much re sponse at Washington, representatives of the northern tier of States do not appear to be solicitouTlo divide their home market with the Canadians, and a certain school of politicians, which views annexation as Canada's manifest destiny, are of the opinion that reciprocity would retard that consum mation. The President's message will shed on this subject a light which it needs. II W IUE 

SILVEI: LAW WOIiKS. While the price of silver hat not advanced ' as wag expected under tbe present law, the I'resiuent thinks it should be given further trial. He accounts for the depression id silver bullion partly by. the falling off in the exports from London to India and partly to increased production. Tin: export.-) of silver bullion last year were but 813,707,391. against an average for ten years of 517.000, --000. The amount purchased by the Govorn •iient m more than 10,000,000 in excess of ti.e domestic product after allowing for the btilliou and iv the arts. The President does j n. t regard free coinage with favor at least until the present law has been thoroughly tested. __^______^__ THE 

NOUTHKUN CITBCS KELT. A no: thorn daily having commented favorably upon the coming citrus fair at Auburn, the Los Angeles. Citizen takes ex ception to the comment, and. after some as persion of the quality of northern citrus fruits, says: A3 la quantity, the (northern) editor knows veiy well that there are more oranges grown ou a u n-acre lot In Southern California than In the entire northern citrus belt. It is a well-known fact that by far the greater part of California's citrus croD conies from the southern part of the State, only about one-sixth as much fruit being raised in the north as there. Notwithstand ing fiis, however, the extravagant claim of the Citizen is hardly borne out by the facts. There are to-day in the northern citrus belt some 30.000 orange and lemon trees in full hearing. Even allowing all that Is claimed for Southern California's remark able soil and wonderful climate, it can hardly be seriously maintained that ten acres there will bear as much fruit as 3000 acres' here. There are many portions of Northern California where oranges will not grow, at least to be worth cultivating, ami doubtless there are similar places in the south. As to quality, it is with us here as it ii also in the south — some sections produce excellent fruit, others produce such as is not worth the picking. We have eaten oranges grown in Alaueda, Stanislaus and Yuba counties that seemed in all respects equal to tha fine products of Riverside. Such are not yet to be found here in car-load lots. Car-load lots of oranges of any quality are. but just beginning to be shipped from Northern Cal ifornia, but there is a growing demand for what we have, and the quantity is Increas ing of our citrus fruits, while at the sania time the quality is improving. While we have as yet but 30,000 bearing trees, there are fully 200,000 trees not yet come to bear ing in the northern belt. The last northern citrus fair, at Oroville, fully demonstrated that this new industry has made rapid progress in the north, and there can be no doubt but that the coining exhibit at Auburn will show still greater advance, and that our northern growers will be able to show some fruit comparing very favorably with southern products. THE MKSSAtiK ON FIIKEIUN POLICY. There is little Id the President's message on our relations with foreign powers that has tlie merit of novelty. Thanks to the newspapers and to the enterprise of inter viewers diplomacy lias now no secret-. Everything that is done or said between nations is public property from the s;art. Thus the nrgotiatious on tlie Bearing question, on the Canadian boundary, on the exclusion of American pork from the conti nental countries <>[ Europe, on the lynching affair at New Orleans, on the Chilean out rages, on the case of the ltata, on the Mexi can treaty, on tlie Pan-American Confer ence, aro all twice-told tales to the average newspaper reader; for points that are new ho will have to refer to those passages in the message which refer to Russia, Guiana, Chin >, and the -late of tlie law touching the status of foreigners in this country. The paragraph which deals with the effect of 1; ssian anti-Semitic legislation on immi gration into this country presents views which are striking anil new. The President says that the new Russian orders of exile issued against tlie Jews will have the effect of ll odiug this country with a million Rus sian Jews within a few years. These people will come here, for the most part, without money, without knowledge of dut language, and with at a mechanical trade. They can not but find it difficult to earn a living here, and they must crowd the lab>r nmrket, .so as to impair the living of the working cla«s that is now in the country. The President puts it to the Kir.peror whether this is fair to the United States, and whether it is wise to provoke retaliatory legislation by Con gress looking to the exclusion of l: :-- an refugees. '1 his Is a point of view iv which the subject has not hitherto been considered at st. Petersburg. It may lead to serious reflection. The paragraph which refers to the dis pute between (ireat Britain and Venezuela over tlie boundary of Uritish Guiana does not contain any new statements of fact, but its references to tlie application of the Mon roe doctrine to the pending controversy ar«i rrwre pointed than former Presidential messages have been. The simple fact is that Great Britain, relying upon hor su perior strength, has encroached upan the territory of Venezuela and occupies a lari,'o tract thereof, including some valuable cold mines, in spite of the protest of the weaker nation; and the question which arises is whether the Monroe doctrine does not re quire the Unit 4 States to insist upon the appointaieut of a commission to delimit tue disputed frontier. The controversy is not new; it was in existence twelve years ago; but President Harrison now 9>iys it is time it were closed. In that opinion the American people will a,;ree with him, the more readily because everybody realizes that England would tiot light for a slice of Venezuela. In regard to China, the President finds fault with the Government at Pi-king for refusing to receive Mr. Blair. Nothing is better settled by law aud usage than that a nation has a right to refuse to receive a diplomatic agent who. iv the language of the old writers, i 3 persona non grata. It was in reliance on that doctrine that Gen eral Grant declined to recognize M. Cata cazy as Minister from Russia, after he had made himself offensive at Washington, and that Austria refused to receive the person whom Air. Cleveland had appointed ilin ister to Vienna. The President's suggestion that offenses against the persons of foreigners, citizens ol countries with which the United .states h vi! treaties, should be triable in United States courts will command general ap proval. As the law now stands, if a citizen owes money to a foreigner the latter may sue iv the United .States courts. But if a citizen kills a foreigner the .Stite courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the case. This appears to involve an incongruity. A treaty concluded by the Government of the United .States is the law of the land, and the Government is bound to execute it lik« any other law ; but if its execution must be con fided to State courts, it will he evaded when ever popular passion or prejudice is roused against a particular nationality. This places the Government in the position of being un able to fuilill its treaty obligations and of having to confess the fact to the foreiya world. We may see differently in the law if turned against ourselves in the pending con troversy with Chile. In that affair a Val paiaso mob killed nnd wounded a uumher of American sailors. Mr. Harrison de manded satisfaction. To that the Chileans replied that the criminal courts of Valpa raiso had exclusive jurisdiction over the alleged crime nnd that they were investigat ing the nintter. The Washlngt* n authorities retorted, In substance, thut they had noth ing to do with the courts at Valparaiso; American citizens had been killed and they insisted on their demand for reparation. To that contention Chile has u*de 110 reply and the case rests there. In the present state of public feeling at Valparaiso it is possible that the courts may find that the Americans were the aggressors in the matter and thnt Uie police killed thrtm in self-defenae. HIIM-i. 

IMMIGRATION. The President calls allflntton to tlin difH culties attending tha enforcement of the Chinese restriction laws under the existing conditions. Canada, lie says, admits Chi nese on payment of a per capita tax of SSO, which is often paid with tlie intention of evading tlie American law asaitist Chinese iuiniigraiinn. The Chinese cross tho border, and, if arrested and sent b:ick, may recros* at l'lcu-ure. The I'residi-nt advises legislation which will put a siod to these practices. Wliile the l-'resident makes no suggestion as to the nature of the desired legislation, it will occur to a gool many peo ple that the remedy lieu with the Executive Department of the Govern ment. The Canadian law which admits Chinese on payment of a par capita tax may falrlv bn considered, unfriendly legi3 -latinn. WIiIIh we cannot demand of Can ada a repeal of the law, we Ban make It Canada's interest to repeal it. Canadian railroads are now enjoying privileges indis pensable to their existence by favor of the Executive .Department of the Washington THE 

MORNING CALL. SAN FRANCISCO. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 10. 1891-EIGHT PAGES. [ Government. While the Canadian railroads might not like to relinquish so profitable a truffle as importing Chinese for American consumption, they would, perhaps, rather submit to this loss than to the lu-s of tlio right tocarry goods through Canadain bond. I THE NICARAGUA CAJiAI.. ' There will probably be some diversity of opinion as to the President's recommenda tion that the Government indorse the bonds of the Nicaragua Canal Company to tin 1 ex tent that may be necessary to insure the early completion of the canal. Objections will arise principally from the fact that the Government's experience as an indorser has not been of a nature to wnrrant a continu ance in that policy. .The fact remains, how ever, that the opening of a waterway be tween the two oceans is a necessity so im perative that the withholding of aid by the Government would only cause a little delay and a considerable increase in the cost of the work. The Nicaragua company will eventually get the required capital, but may have to pay a largo bonus for it. A guar anty of the bonds by the Government would secure all the money needed and at the low est current rate of interest. It is not diffi cult to imagine emergencies in which the canaj would be worth to the Government twice what it will co3t. While the rule not to lend the Government credit to private corporations is a.gooJ one to hold fast to, an exception was made in the aid given to the first continental railroad, and may be made Bg*ln a quarter of a century later in con necting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It may be laid alto in behalf of this enterprise that them are no other oceans on the conti nent to connect. The completion of the Nicaragua Canal on a basis of cost with tolls as low as the Cost of the service will warrant will give along rest to other projects for connecting the two oceans. Private capital I would be re I ant to go into competing en- I terprises whether by water or by land. 

STANDS BY TIIK TAIIIFF. The President stands by the present tariff. He declares that there is no reason why he should not. It has disappointed the evil prophecies of its opponents and in a large measure realized the hopeful predic tions of its friends. A day's labor will buy more now than at almost any other period in the history of the country. The volume of foreign trade has Increased more than 8100,000,000 over the preceding year. Kx ports for the year ending September ."''th were $923,091,136, against $960,177,115 for the preceding year. One of the objections urged against the McKlniey bill was that it would reduce tbe volume of foreign com merce. One of our imaginative conteinpo riries drew a picture of the port of San l-'rauciscii a> it would appear after the Mc- Kinli-y tariff got fairly at w rk. In respect to the revenue the tariff seems to have worked equally well. Tiie total revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891, wen- (458,514,233 03, expenditures 8421,304, --■ITo 4ii, leaving a surplus of 137,239,763 (17. It appears, therefore, that the surplus ttiat gave Mr. Cleveland so much uneasiness has not entirely disappeared. A ShNM lIVK .11 KOR.

The juror tbe next J.iy asked to bo excused from further jury duty, giving the reason that he did not like to be talked to in tha! way.
