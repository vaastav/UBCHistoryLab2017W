Wednesday, December 9, 1S85. WILM1M El. VANDRKBILT. "William H. Vanderbilt, who was yesterday morning the richest man in this country, and was envied by millions, was in the relentless grasp of death before yesterday evening. His many millions conld not keep him alive and cannot rescue him from death." And "all he can hold in his cold dead hand, is what he has given away." The story of his career is already well known to the American pnblic. Much of his life was snent in comnarativs obsenritv E until his father called him to the front to re- I tain and increase the wealth of the "Vander bilt family. The old commodore judged wisely concerning his ability, as the sequel has shown. He could not have found any body better fitted for the work. The record of the dead man as a money- getter is perhaps mere respectable than that of some of the "money kings" of this coun try. At least no such complaints have been made against him as have been made against Jay Gould and others. Still, he has not won a wide reputation for generosity and unselfishness in his dealings with his fel low men, and there is no indication that he wanted to. He has, however, planned and carried out some great schemes which have been of much benefit to the country. The rich man liked one thing almost as well as he did money and that was a nood horse. He liked to own, drive and be with good horses, and those who know what good horses are have always thought better of him because he had such a liking for horses. It is interesting to speculate concerning the effect which his death will have on the great fortune whioh he and his father ol lected. If it should be scattered it would be a good thing for the country. Another in teresting question is, what effect will his peciaily on the stocks with whioh hhas been indentified. A great many very anxious investors in these stocks are wishing that they knew what te-do. , THE MESSAGE. We have been told that President Cleve land was a man of few words. Twenty thou sand is not "a few," and yet he takes twenty thousand words, more or less, to tell Con gress" and the people what he thinks about the state of the country and the improve ments which he thinks ought to be made. As life is short, and space in the Journal and Courier is limited, we put before our readers this morning the most important parts of the message and omit that which is not of general interest. In his discussion of our foreign relations the President pays attention to the Chinese question. He seems to be of the opinion that the Chinese must go, though he declares that all the powers of the government should be exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of those who have murdered Chinamen in Wyoming and Washington territories. Perhaps no part of the message will be read more eagerly and carefully than that whioh relates to tho tariff. This matter is treated very carefully and wisely. The President would like to &ee the burdens of the people reduced, but he does not think there is now any occasion for the general dis cussion of the wisdom or expediency of a protective system. The silver problem receives very foil dis cussion, and the suspension ef the compul sory coinage of silver dollars is reoom mended. The reasons the President gives for this recommendation are very convincing. The Indian problem is wisely and humane ly treated, and what the President has to say concerning the public lands will meet the approval of all true patriots. Much in terest has been felt in what the message would say concerning the Mormons. Noth ing could be more satisfactory or more to the point than this part of the message. The President is still a civil service re former, although he has done some things which looked the other way. We reoommend our readers to pay careful attention to his remarks upon this topic. -They are well worth reading and thinking of. . On the whole the message will make a good impression. It is not a brilliant or startling document, but it is thorough, straightforward and' bold, and its recom mendations will meet general approval. It is a pity that it is so long. 

EDITORIAL NOTES. The sailing for France yesterday of six un fortunate children who were bitten by a mad dog in Newark the other day was a notable event. They have gone to be treated by M. Pasteur, the celebrated Frenchman who laims to be able to prevent hydrophobia by inoculation with hydrophobic virus. Their experience will be watched with great interest in this and other countries. - In a recent speech in his cathedral city the Archbishop of Canterbury, alluding to the preposterous notions prevalent among the peasantry in England as to the advantages they ore to reap from disestablishment, said: "There is a parish where there is a devoted clergyman, whose family are coastant in their attention to the sick and sorrowing. One of them discovered that many of the cottagers she visited were in favor of disestablish ment. She asked several 'Why!' but could get no answer. At length a man said, 'Well, mum, I know it's a pity,, but it would be very convenient to have a cow. We do want a cow, mum.' " The people of New Hampshire seem to be in a way to find oat that the passage of the now. famous "Valued Policy" law was a mis; take. Among other injuries it threatems to seriously hurt the ''summer , boarder" busi ness. There are in the State, of hotels only opened for the summer traffic no less than 142 whieh have accommodations for over 50 people apiece, while a number of them are large enough to house hundreds of people at once. ' They are costly structures, with ex pensive furnishings, and are always consid- ered very risky property; the insurance on one of the great hotels being usually distrib utee! among a large number of companies. Since the new law went into effect, and the foreign companies withdrew from the State, not a company in New Hampshire will take a dollar on such property. Their policies are running ont daily, and everybody who has capital invested in them is anxious to get it out, while an effectual quietus has been put upon all new enterprises, like the projected $65,000 extension of the Glen House and the erection of other hotels. , The wild-beast pest but slowly disappears in British India. There is, however, a slight decrease in the loss of life from the bites of wild animals and venomous snakes. The numbers are 22,905 for 1883 and 22,425 for 1884. The numbers representing those due to snake bites are 20,067 and 19,629 in the two years respectively. The reported loss of cattle amounted to 49,672, against 47,478 in the previous year. Of these, 47, 944 are said to have been caused by wild ani mals and 1,728 by snakes. Tigers and leop ards are shown to have been about equally destructive, having killed 19,680 and 19,699 head of cattle respectively. In the number of wild animals destroyed there was a satis factory increase from 19,890 in the previous year to 23,775. . The destruction of poison ous snakes is enormous, but the aumbera have declined from 412,782 -to 380,981. Wherever the system of rewards has been pursued the figures have shown a satisfac tory increase, although it naturally happens that here and there a too adventurous csnake killer pays for his daring with his life. RECENT PUBLICATIONS. "Loyal to the King" is an excellent story by E. A. W., author of "St. Ulrioh; er, Resting on the King's Word." It is a work that combines clearness and interest with 're ligions feeling, giving a moral that cannot be mistaken and which is present ' from the beginning to the end of the book. Falling snowflakes with their lesson lead to thinking upon the great subject of doing the Creator's will, and starting from this, the book weaves a gentle thread of story, the entering upon another life.
