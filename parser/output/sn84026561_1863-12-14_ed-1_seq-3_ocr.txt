rTn 1 AT Congress. The two Houses of the Congress of the Confederate States of America, convened in Richmond on Monday last. . Both bo dies jumped at once into the great work before them the business of doing some thing to relieve the currency claimed their first and earnest attention. We give the following, full Synopsis of the President's Message The President ranidlv reviews vpnf of the past year, and says that whilst our successes have not equalled our ex pectations, we have checked the enemy everywhere in his advances. Our relations with foreign nations is discussed at consideiable length. The President regrets that there has been no improvement since his last message in January, and says ihe conduct of Euro pean nations is' less impartial and in Home cases has assumed the character of positively unfriendlyness. Our Com mis. tiioners were sent abroad for the purpose f t Antfinmv intA m.ntinf in..,. . ll v vIi,wiiaio uiiu iivvuauuiis proper i Di the relative rights and obligations be tween the Confederate and United States Under treaties entered into vvitli foreign powers prior to the separation which has taken place, but this tender on our part was declined. Hence, as we have been refused the benefits of these trea ties, they certainly have ceased to bo binding, and in the opinion of the Pres ident our relations with European pow ers aie now controlled exclusively by the genera! rules of the law of nations. Legislation upon the suljcct ol finance is earnestly recommended. Although the magnitude and duration of the war was not at first anticipated, still the re sources of the country a.e so ample and the spirit of the people so devoted to the cause, that leliei" is within our reach. The financial policy of the Government since its formation is discussed, and the President contends that whilst the pro vision of the Permanent Constitution in regard to direct taxation cannot be car ried into effect in the mode pointed out it is plain that the duty ol Congress is to execute the general intent of the Consti tution by making the tax uniform throughout the country? These consid erations are greatly enforced by the re flection that an attempt to apportion the taxes amongst the States, some ol which are wholly or partially in the occupation of the enemy, would subvert the whole intention of the framers of the Constitu tion and bo productive of most revolting injustice, instead of that just correlation between taxation and representation which was their purpose to secure. .With large portions of some of the Slates occupied by the enemy, what justice would there be in imposing bh the r. f s ( " " " . wy. j 01 ST mainour ue wn&itt amount ol taxation o viwev kjL'yep f iMillJF ftj WOUKl Uil the war, ami make our own inability to . . protect them from invasion, us we are lequived to do by the Constitution, the ground for adding to their loaves by ah atteinpufel adherence to ihe 'latter,, in violation of the spirit of that instrument. No such purpose couid have been enter tained ai.d no such re.-ult was contem plated by the framers of the Constitu tion. We may add weight to those' con siderations if we reflect that although the Constitution piovided that it should go into operation with a representation temporarily distributed among the States, it expressly ordains that after providing for a census within three years after this tempoiaiy distribution the representa tive power is to end until such enumer ation shall be made. Would any one argue that because the census cannot be made wiihin the fixed period, the gov. eminent, at the expiration of that peri od, shall perish for the want of a repre sentative body ? In any npet in which the subject can be viewed, i am led to the conclusion aL ready announced, .and which is under stood to be in accordance with the .vote taken in one or both Houses at the last session. 1 shall, therefore, until we are able to pursue the precise mode requir ed by t he Constitution, deem it my duty to approve any lavy levying taxation, which you are bound to ' impp.se in de fence of the country, in any other prac ticable movie ; whiuli shall distribute the burthen uniformly and impartially on the whole property ot the people In your termer legislation you have sought to .avoid an incieabe ol the volume of notes in circulation, offering inducements or -voluntary funding, and. measures were adopted for that purpose, but proved on ly parti'illy successful, and the evil has now reached Mien a magnitude as to peimit no other remedy than a compul sory reduction of the currency to the amount reqairei by .the business of the country. This reduction should be ac companicd by a pledge that under no stress of circumstances w ill that amount bo exceeded. iN'o possible mode of us iog the credit of the government can be SO disastrous as the one which disturbs the basVs of all exchanges. It renders impossible all calculations? of the 'future values, augments in constantly increas ing proportions the price of all commodi ties and feo depreciates all fixed Wages, salaries and incomes, as to renoer them inadequate to a bare subsistence. It to these be added the still more latal influ ence on the moral character of the peo ple, I am persuaded that you will concur in the conclusion that an inflexible ad- herencd to a limitation of the currency, ' fivpd sum. is an indispensable ele- ient in any system oi finance now to do adopted. The holders of currency now outstanding can only be protected in the recovery of just claims by substituting for notes some other security. If the currency is not greatly and promptly re duced, the present scale ef inflated pri ces will not only continue to exist, but by the very fact that the large amount thus made necessary in the conduct of the war, those prices will reach 'Tates more extravagant and the whole sys tem fall under its own weight, thus ren dering a reduction of the debt impossible and destroying-its whole value in -the hands of the holder. If, on the contra ry, a funded debt, with interest secured by adequate taxation, is substituted for the outstanding currency, its entire amount will be available to the holder, and the Government will be in a condi tion enabling it, beyond the reach of any provable contingency,' to prosecute the war to a successful issue. It is therefore demanded, as well by the interest of the creditor as of the country at large, that treasury notes be converted into bomis, bearing adequate interest, with a pro vision for taxation sufficient to ensure punctual payment and final redemption of the whole deb t. The President recommends to the con sideration of Congress the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and hopes it will engress the consideration of that body until disposed of in a proper man ner and the important results which the country anticipated from its actions be attained. The President believes the army to be in a better condition than' at any previ ous period of the war. He recommends tiie restoration to the army of all who are improperly absent, putting an end jto substitution, modifying the exemption law,, restricting detiils and placing in the ranks all ableboditd men now employwd as wagoners, nurses, cooks, and other employees doing service for which ne groes may be found cempetent. He con curs in' the opinion expressed by the Secretary of War thatthere is no giound for objection that a new provision, to in clude those who" have furnishd substi tutes under former 'calls, would be a breach of contract. The action of the several Executive Departments is review ed, and the gratifying announcement is made that the receipts of the Pest Office Department are six hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars in excess of expenditures. The communication with thJ franc- Mississippi h obstructed so as to render it difficult to comply with the Exec- f utive -needs. Legislation is require, i providing for the exercise of temporary I' authority, especially in the Postal ' and L I Treasury .Departments, .for which sub- I secretaries are recommended, while for j. military affairs it would seem to be suf- j? ficint to authorize the President and i Secretary of War to delegafch to 'com- f Morgan I IaP "We give the follow :g ription of Gen.

M tf Report of the Secretary of War. The report of the Secretarr of Tar vpry lengthy and a highly important c ument. It briefly refers to the princi pal operations of the army in the -esiml departments. Says the campaign af Mississippi was certainly disastrous, ar.d that it is difficult to resist the impre.'jsxm that these disasters were not inevitable; that a Court qf Enquiry to investigate toe whoiej -CJithpaign met at Atlanta-ra Septerober. but in consequence of she proximity of the enemy demanding the presence of witnesses and judges at other- points, it has been suspended tempc-rM-ily, but is expecied soon to reasswHi blc. Deficiency of resources in mt-u and provisions, rather than reverses in bat tle, caused the withdrawal of the army from Middle Tennessee. Alludes to de serting, straggling and nbsentees, and says the effective toi ce of the army is lit tle over half, or nearly two-thirds ef'the men on the rolls. Recommends the re peal of the substitute and exemption provision, ana tnat all nnving substitutes be immediately required to go into the field ; that the privilege which Congress granted to put in substitutes can be reg ulaily and constitutionally abrogated by the same power, lie says no cixnpact was entered into between the govern ment and the person furnishing the sub stitute, as. alleged, but only a privilege of the government accorded. Instead cf complaining at the abrogation, he should be grateful for what, has heretofore been allowed him. Recommends an abridge ment'of the exemption,conscribi-ng all and making details for the wants of society athom. Says three years men, when their terms.expiie, cannot be finally dis charged. They should be retained, al lowing them to choose so in 2 existing company, under present organization, in some arm of the service. Recommends the consolidation of companies and. reg iments reduced below a certain cemple raent. Pays, a glowing tribute to the heroism, endurance and unfaltering de votion of the soldiers and the lamented dead who have yielded their lives a saoj ntace on the altar ot nocrry.

The two Houses have resolved to ad- ourn sine die on the 14th-. Hon. B, II. Hill, of Ga., has pub- lished a card, calling upon all the offi cers and soldiers who are. away from their respective regiments, to return to their posts. He says if they had been there, those belonging to Bragg's army, that instead of being defeated, tfeey would have, Veen before Nashville this day ; and that even now, if they wid return promptly, Grant's army will be destroyed or captured, and when this i3 done the war cannot last much longer, for Lincoln's power will be broken. It is siid that out of 103,000-names enroll ed in Bragg's army, only forty thousand were present for duty ! Gen. Lee's army is said to be weakened almest as much for the same cause. What can be expected ins-uch a state of affairs as this ? Certainly nothing less than defea'. Forty thousand effective men pitcaed against a hundred thousand! Is it any wonder that we hear bad news? Have we any right to listsn for-anything else ? In the name of reason let the the attack. This vile sjoundrel is a fighting men gather to iheir commands German, or pole, we forget which, by urm ana belonged to thev old regular .army oS the United States' " As far aS public opfnion goes, Gen.

Other officers, of course, come in for. due- share of the glory ; but the story is Hardee saved the army." Gen Bkagg. The gallantry of Gener- ) ai xsragg is cuiupwuitnieu-oin every source, lix the engagement of the " 25th, near ChattuiHcgu, tie rue up within one bundl ed and fifty yerdjaf the en emy, in endeavoring to rally .the left wing.

The band offthe Great Jtuler -J Let public opinion coma to the aid of the suffering heroes in the front, who ara fighting at these terrible edds, and fill up the ranks again. It is. ridiculous for Congress to talk about changing the conscript ages from 16 to oQ, when more than half the army we now have are skulking duty, abusing furloughs, thronging our railroad and noteis, gallanting lauies, ana enjoying the hospitalities of friends at home who have litt'e iaea that they aro skulking from the army and that they are so much needed there. As Mr. Hill says : 44 Let tbe P. ess, the people,: the old men and the ladies, ply the aoseetees, and make them tee what is true that absence yer se dis reputable. Let nothing. but abiolut sickness excuse. No man can serve two masters; 44 and no ma:belorging to the army can discharge hisMuty in any oth er position. This was Gen. Longstreet's emphatic expression." Bivo-jA.c. 4th Reg. X. C. Cr.,' Utc 2. Me. EDrrorc: As movements nf -rxst importance aro now trinspiring in this part of the moral vineyard, and knowing that the people at home are desirous of . information, from the hills cf expected conflict, I have concluded to spend a few moment in preparing a short narr.itirr giving all the reliabfe information I'ci gain in relation to the affairs on tlh Rapidan. On the 20th ult., the quietude of our supposed winter quarters was put in n.otion by the dashm oi a dov.en couriers frantically by, aad socn the orde came ibr tbe commanders- cf t ier reeiments to provide their comuad8 with ammunition, sufficient for a tnttls, and also be reaJy with (77 seven uay . rationn, to march at any moment. In a . lew moments the second order came to mount and move to the front. So we had to bundle up our traps at 10 P. M. and move off tu pirts unknown, through . the cold. We proceeded six miles toward the Rapidan, were halted and permitted to dismount and build little fires to warm our frozen extremities. Soorr 'on the 27th, the. column was put in motion, and in front, headed by the gu'ilant and esteemed Generals,Hmptrn and Gordon. Gordon's Brigade moved otf- to the.iight of Vidiersvdle, arrived at the Plank road, when Gan. Stuart, as usual when a fignt is on hand, appeared. The 4th was ordered to lront, mounted : one squadron cf the 5th and 2d were ordered to sharp hoot on foot, and soon the carbines commenced and were replied to by yankee infantry by the thousand, apparently. Gen. Gordon gave th order ilraio sahrc charge I Away went the 4th headed by tho gallant Captain Johnson and Adjutant Moore, but as Gen. Gordon always sees as far into the front as airy body, he ordered the 4th to halt, as it. was impolitic to charge an infantry column, posted as it was, and for about one hour we were held in plain view of the enemy, subjected to the fire effthe whole . yaoeeCwnt. WKU,.in Vjvia,.rt. horrible position, Capt. J. 1. BrycTfCo. L, was severely wounded in the fot ; Capt. Johnson, Co'. Ar (commanding tho regiment.) Lt Wilson, Co. G.'; Lt. Lewis, Co. D, and two of Co. A, had their horses shot dead ; only ana maa was seriously wqunded. We were than ordered to-fall back to a better position, where we were joined: by Gen. Young's Brigade and a portion of Gen. A. P. Hill's corps. A sharp skirmish ensued, resulting in the repulse of the enemy. On the 23th, Gen. Hampten- with a portion, cf hjs. division made - a raid in the rear, engaged the yankee cavalry, whipped and routed them, pursued tliem for four miles into their camps, captured 400 prisoners, destroyed an amount of stores, &c, &c., turned about for our lines, run into a corp of infantry, which' caused the loss of about one htrlf ie prisoners, the balance weio brought safely into Dixie : our loss quite small only one killed in our brigade (a mem ber of the 1st N. C. ReeimcnL the b;t a -.ww cavalry regiment ever mustered.) Gen. Gordon had a horse shot under hira. Since that date our division has -been doing picket duty down about Antioch Church, and sharp shooting against the yankea infantry by the day on the right of oar lines. The boys are all in fifae spirits, and feci confidence in the. skill of their Com-rnander-in-Chief.to plan and their ability being fortified by justice and honor to execute, and victory must and will perch on our banners. It is very quiet to day, no cannon even firing, but the volcanic craUr will, break loose and that soon. Of the slight engagements of Sabbath last between the infantry, &c, you ere advised. Therefore, I will close for. tho present pardon this. Yours Respectfully, Mv Co. A, th Reg N. C. Cav. SftWiAjpej
