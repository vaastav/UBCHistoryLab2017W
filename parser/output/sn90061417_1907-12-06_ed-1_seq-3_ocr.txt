THE PRESIDENT'S MIME ISSSGt CAUSES OF THE PRE3ZNT FINAN CIAL CONDITION'S IS MADE THE CHIEF TOPIC. SUGGESTS REMEDIES FOR ILLS CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS AND RAILROADS TO PR2VENT OVERCAPITALIZATION. Believes This Wculd Scive tne Prob lem Together with Provision for More Elastic Currency Recom mends Postal Banks and Acks for Legislation Along Many Lines. Washington. Dec. 3. President Roosevelt's annual message- to conrtss is a voluminous docu . .:it of nearly 30.000 words, by far the longest mes sage he has ever submitted to congress. The opening- subject of the message is the financial condition of the country, and for which the president lays much of the blame upon unscrupulous stock speculators, and says: "In any large body of men. however, there are certain to be some who are dishonest, and if the conditions are such that these men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a ery evil thins for the community. Where these men are busi ness men of great sagacity and of tem perament both unscrupulous and reck less, and where the conditions are such that they act without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many innocent people into making in vestments or embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successful ly dishonest men are discovered, suf fering comes not only upon them, but upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and. naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the giJilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the dis tress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Vet it is not possible t refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdieels that are the ultimate causisnf the suf fering, and. as a imaiis to this inJ. where possible to punish those re sponsible for them. There may be hon est differences of opinion as to many governmental policies; but surely th: re can be no such differences as to the need of unflinching perseverince in tht war against successful dishou. : ty." He quotes at length from his mes sage of last year in which he- advo cated federal control of corporations doing interstate business, and bt.i.-vts that in such control would be feund ti. remedy for overcapitalization ami stock speculation which lie believes have brought about the pn.-.nt :".:ta:i cial conditions. lie says: "Our steady aim should be h.. legis lation, cautiously and carefully un.- r t::k n. but resolutely pcrsevcr. d in. to as-se rt the sovereignty of the n tti.ma. giV( riniii nl by affirmative aeticn "This is only in form an i.i i iv:t;on. In substance it is merely a restoration: for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities lias been recognized in the action of the law making bodies; and all that i pr.-.-wj-e is to meet the changed conditions : such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it lias always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also in England before and since this country became a separate nation. Keeioral Control of Itnilro.-ids In Favored. "No small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self-reliance, of indcpcndi nee in initiative and action. It Is wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for its fullest ex ercise, compatible with seeing that lib erty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately, this is the kind of liberty that the lack of nil effective regulation inevitably breeds. The founders of the constitution pro vided that the national gov. rnuient should have complete and sole control of interstate commerce. Tin re v:-s then practically no int-r.-tato busiin-s save such as was conducted by water, and this the national government at once proceeded to regulate in thorough going and effective fashion. Condi tions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce by water is in significant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big business concerns are now engaged in interstate commerce. As a result, it can be but partially and imperfectly controlled or regulated by the action of any one of the several states; such ac tion inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else too lax. and In either case ineffective for purposes of justice. Only the national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority, for such authority already exists under the constitution in amplest and most far-reaching form; but it does mean that there should be an extension of federal activity. This is not advocating centralization. It is j merely looking facts in the face, and realizing that centralization in business has already come ami can not be avoid ed or undone, and that the public at large can only protect itself from cer tain evil effects of this business cen tralization by providing better methods for the exercise of control through the authority already centralized in the national government by the constitu tion itself. There must be no halt in the healthy construe tivc course of ac tion which this nation has lc.-t. d to pursue, and has st adily pursued, .lur ing the last six .-ears, as shown both in the legislation .f the nmsn ss and the administration of the law by t'ie de partment of justice. The mot ,t..l need is in conn tion with ihe railroads. As to these, m my judgment there should now be either a national incor poration act or a law licensing railway companies to engage in interstate- com merce upon c rtain condif.ons. The law should be so framed as to give to the interstate commerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of securi ties, while ample means should be pro vided to enable the commission, when ever in its judgment it is necessary, to make a physical valuation of any rail road. As I stated in my message to the congress a year ago. railroads should be given power to enter into agree ments, subject to these agreements be lay made public in minute detail and to the consent of the Interstate commerce commission being first obtained. Until the national government assumes proper control of interstate commerce, n the exercise of the authority it al ready possesses, it will be impossible either to give to or to get from the railroads full Justice. The railroads and all other great corporations will do well to recognize t!ut this control must come; the only qui stion is as to what governmental body can most wisely exercise it. The courts will de termine the limits within which the federal authority can exercise it. and : there will still remain ample work ; within each state for the railway com- mission of that state; and the national interstate commerce commission will ; work in harmony with the several state , . o:.. mission.-, e.icii within .ts own prov- nice, to ai : ieve the desired end. oi:trol r Interstate i .iimlue.i Ccneern I rged. "Moreover, in my judgment there should he additional legislation loul-.ng to tne ,nptr coii.iul ui the great business con terns engaged in interstate business, this control to be exercised for their own benefit and prosperity no Iei.s than for ...e prolcit'.oii oi' investors uud of the general p' ..ic As 1 have repeatedly .n messages to congress and else where, ' -experience has d finitely shown iii n.erelj the unwisdom nut the futility endea...ing to put a su;p to all busi ness combinations. Modern industrial conditions are such that eou.binatiun is not only nec ssary but inevitable. It is so in Lie wo. Id of b:.s:iiess ust as it is so in tlie wor.d of luaor. ami it is as idle to desire to put an end to all corpora tions, to all big co:r.5ti!iat.::s of capital, us to desire to put an end to coiiioiiia .ions of labor.

Whenever in either there s evil, it should be proii.pilv held to ac . ot'Sii: bill it shotiio receive hearty en- .i.iageineiit so long as it is p.perly i..t:ia..ed. It is profoundly immoral to ..;; or keep on the statute boon:; a law. lominally in the interest of public mnral- -. thai really puts a pre::::;.:ii upon . .1..!.. -.alio, by u.idenaking to : o.d l.i.j. tiieii from dal.ig wh-it must ie done under modern Li.iS:iie-ss conde mns, so that the la.v its. . ji.-..!" that u; own infraction must be the- ri..a:i:;on .re. edent upon busur.ss success. To aim : the ae.-oiap: a; of too u:u h usu- illy niuiis the a.-, oiuplishiuent of too lit !e. and often the doing of positive dam- Vi.e antitrust law should not be re-..h-d: b-.it it should be made both more .-..a i it and more in harmony with act a! t in; iitions. It should be so amended s to forbid only the kind of combination ...h h .iocs harm to the general public. ,.t it amendment to be a. companied by. r to be an incident of. a grant of su iT:s.jry power to ti.e government over . e--.e big corporations engaged in inter ate business. This should be aecom ...iii.ed by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjee oii of books and papers to the inspec i.'ii of the government officials. A be--'nriing has already been made for such upcrvision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations. "The antitrust law should not prohibit omhitiations that do no injustice to the ii-blic. still less those the existence of . hich is on the whole of benefit to the lublic. But even if this feature of the aw were abolished, there would remain s aa equally objectionable feature the ;:tnei:!ty and delay now incident to its lft rcenient. The government must now :.bmit to irksome and repeated delays efore :bt;.T!iing a final decision of the orrts upon proceedings instituted, and ven si favorable decree may mean an ; ptv victory. Moreover, to attempt to e-atrol these corporations by lawsuits lii-uns to impose upon both the depart ment of justie and the courts an iui ji.isa'hlc burden: it is not feasible to carry n more than a limited number ot such suits. Ssi'-h ;i law to be really effective :!:: of mirse be administered by an Ad iit ii body, and not merely by means f lawsuits. The design should be to .irevent tin- abuses incident to the crea ::on of unhealthy and improper combina tions, instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to de stroy lb in by civil or criminal proceed ings. l:i e.-tlug yublle .Should He Imply Safeguarded. "The congress has the power to charter . ..rporations to engage in interstate and "r.-ign commerce, and a general law can i enacted under the. provisions of which is:in.g corporations could lake out fed iul charters and new federal corpora lions could be created. An essential pro vision of such a law should be a method f predetermining by some federal board . r commission whether the applicant for : f.-i.-ral charter was an association or ombination within the restrictions of the :'ederal law. Provision should .also be nie for conipl.-te publicity in all mutters f fee ting the piddle a.il complete protec .ioii to i'ic investing public and the share oolilers in the matter of issuing corporate ;i-ciirities. If an incorporation law is not d'-eined advisable, a li ens.- act for big :nter.-!ati rpor.it inns might be enacted; r a combination of the two might be iried. The supervision established might ' analogous to that now exercised over national banks. At hast, the antitrust act should be suppl-meiited by specific prohibitions of the methods which ex perience has shown have been of most .:er ic. in enabling monopolistic combina tions to crush out competition. The real owners of a corporation should be com pelled to do business in their own name. The right to holt! stock In other corpora tions should heareafter be denied to inter state corporations, unless on approval by the proper government officials, and a prerequisite to such approval should be the listing with the government of all owners and stockholders, both by the corporation owning such stock and by the corporations in which such stock is owned. "To confer upon the national govern ment, in connection with the amendment I advocate in the antitrust law. power of supervision over big business concerns engaged in interstate commerce, would benefit them as it has benefited the na tional banks. In the recent business crisis il is noteworthy that the institu tions which failed were institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the national government. Those which were under national con trol Slood the test. "National control of the kind above ad vocated WOllId be to the benefit of every w ell-maiiiiged railway. Kroin the stand point of the public there is need for ol daional t nicks, aditional terminals, and improvements in the actual haudhng f !.n railroads, and ail this as rapidly .is possible. Ample, siife. and speedy trans portation fa. hitics are even more ueees ary than cheap transportation. There fore, there is need for the investment of money which will pro ide for all thes, tlrngs while at the same time securing as fas as is possible better wag.-s and shorter hours for their employes. There fore, while there must be just and rea sonable regulation of rates, we should be the lirst to protest against .any arbitrary and unthinking movement to cut them down without the fullest and most care ful consideration of all interests con cerned and of the actual needs of the situation. Only a special body of men acting for the national government un der authority conferred upon it by the congress is competent to pass judgment on such a matter. IJreater Klantielty In Currency 1 Urged". The president quotes extensively from his last message in dealing with the di rect subject of currency legislation, and says: "I again urge on the congress the need of immediate attention to this matter. We need a greater elasticity in our cur rency; provided, of course, that we recog nize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the na tional authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. Tne emergency Issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and up on conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Such emerge r.cy issue must be based on adequate se. urities approved by the government, and must be isiU'-d under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent, while securing its re tirement a- the demand fell off. It is v orth investigating to di tcrmine whether otaeers and directors of national b..nks should ever be allowed to loan to them selves. Trust companies should b sub ject to the same sup' rvision as banks: legislation to th's effect should be en acted for the District of Columbia and the territories. "Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject cn.; oniy accomplish a certa'n :.! s nt.

The sole consideration should be to see that the sum total of changes represent the pub lie good. This means that the subje i cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a president. ill elect'on. b--cause as a matter of fsiet experience ban oneus:vely shown that at such a time it is impossible to gel nu n to treat it from the siandpoint of the public good. In my judgment the wise time to de'nl with the matter is immediately after such elec t'on." He asks for the repeal of the tariff on paper and wood pulp. He reviews and enlarges upon his pre vious recommendations for the enact ment of federal inheritance and income tax laws. Attention is called to the prosecution of wealthy offenders against the national laws, and in this eonn"tion he asks that the laws under vvh'ch these prosecutions are brought be strengthened and made more definite. Tlie 1 so and the 'm:nc t.: fit jtiiicilonn. .Ins;:nnes of abuse in the granting of injunctions in labor disputes continue t oit-ur. and the resentment in the initnN of those who fed that their rights ae being invaded .and their liberty of iwtlon and of spech unwarrantably restrained continues to grow. Much of the attack on the use of the process of injunction is wholly without warrant, but 1 am eon sr iined to express the belief that for si tae of it there is warrant. This ques iion is becoming more and more of prime importance, and unless the courts will themselves deal with it in effective man ;icr. it is certain ultimately to demand some form of legislative action. It would be most unfortunat" for our siiil wel fare if we should permit many holies and law-abiding citizens to feel I hat they had just cause for regarding our courts with hostility. I earnestly com mend to the attention cf tne congress this matter, so that son.. : vi.:y he devbed which will limit tlie abuse of i-j-.iuuciioiis and protect those right.-- v.-!.'.---from time to time it unwarrantably in vades. Moreover. d'Sconti-nt is often ex pressed With tile USe of the process of injunction by the courts, not only in la bor disputes, but where state laws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question as I am informed that it will soon re eive the consideration of the supreme court." Of other legislation in the interest of labor he favors federal inspection of rail roads: providing limited but definite com pensation for accidents to all workmen employed in any way by the government, and says: "The constitutionality of the employers' liability act passed by the preceding con gr ss has been carried before the courts. In two jurisdictions the law has been de clared unconstitutional, ami in three juris dictions its constitutionality has been af firmed. The question has been carried to toe supreme court, the case has been heard by that tribunal, and a decision is expected at an early date. In the event that the court should affirm the eonstl tutionality of the act, I urge further leg islation along the lines advocated in my message to the preceding congress. The practice of putting the entire burden of loss of life or limb upon the victim or the victim's family is a form of social in justice '.n which the United States stands in unenviable prominence. In both our federal and our state legislation we have, with few exceptions. scarcely gone farther than the repeal of the fellow servant principle of the old law of liabil ity, and in some of our states even this slight modification of a complete out grown principle has not yet been se cured." He favors the extension of the eight hour law to all departments of the gov ernment, and to all work carried on by the government. He urges legislation for the compulsory investigation of in dustrial disputes, and says: "The need for some provision for such investigation was forcibly illustrated during the past summer. A s.i . of telegraph operators seriously mierf. r d with telegraphic cniumunii a tion caus ing great damage to busin .-.- ini- rests and serious inconvenience to the gen eral public. Appeals were mad.- to me from many parts of the ouuiry. from city councils. from boards of trade, from chambers of comm. r . and fro.-i labor organizations, urging that steps be taken to terminate the strike. ICverything that could with any pro priety be done by a representative of the government was done without avail, and for weeks the public stood by and suffered without recourse of any kind. Had the machinery existed and had there been authority for compulsory Investigation of the dispute, the public vould have been placed in possession of the merits of the controversy, and public opinion would probably have brought about prompt aujustment. "It is idle to hold that without good laws evils such as child labor, as the over-working of women, as the fail ure to protect employes from loss of j life or limb, can be effectively reached. ' any more than the evils of rebates and ' stock-watering- can be reached without good laws.

If .egun at once it can be carried through a time appreciably to relieve the con restion of our great freight-carrying ines of railroads. The work should be -ystematically and continuously carried "orward in accordance with some well oticeived plan. The main streams hould be improved to the highest loint of efficiency before the improve ment of the branches is attempted; and he work should be kept free from very taint of recklessness or jobbery." Attention is e-alled to the work of Ir rigation and reclamation of govern ment lands. Tn the same conneeilon h asks for a revision of the public land .laws along the lin-s proposed by the public lands eommissiem. Believes the government should increae its efforts to conserve our forests and should in crease by purchase the existing forest preserves. On the subject of the natural resources of the tuition he says: "In the eastern Cnited States the mineral fuels have already passed into the hands of large private owners, and those of the west are rapidly following It is obvious that these fuels should be conserved and not wasted, and i would be well to protect the people against unjust and extortionate prices, so fai ns that can still be done. What has been accomplished in the great oi! fields of the Indian Territory by th ictiou of the administration offers a triking example of the good result -of such Ji policy. In my judgment th government should have the right to keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas lielels in its own possession and to leas. the rights to develop them uncle: proper regulations: or else-, if the con gress will not adopt this method, th coal deposits should be sold under lim itations, to conserve them as public utilities, tin right to mini coil bein-r separated from the titb to tie soil The regulations should pri ait coal lands to be worked in s i !ieh nt quan tify by the seveial -orp -ratums.

'-ergress of the Work mi flic- Panama Cauai. "Work on the Panama canal is pro ceeding .n a highly satisfactory man ner. In March tin- total .set vat ion in the Culcbrn Cut where effort was chiefly cone ntrated. was !:..:.' 70 cubb yards. In April this was increased to S70..VJ7 cubic yards. There was a con siderable decrease in the output for May and June owing partly to the ad vent of the rainy season and partly to temporary trouble with the steam shovel men over the qui stion of wages. This trouble was settled satisfactorily to all parties anil in July the total ex cavation advanced materially and in August the grand total from all points in the canal prism by steam shovels and dredges exceeded all previous I'nited States records, reaching 1.II74. 404 cubic yards. In September this rec ord was eclipsed and a total of l.f.17. 412 cubic yards was removed. Of this amount 1.4S1.307 cubic yards were from the canal. prism and :b..llif. cubic yards were from accessory works. These re sults were achieved in the rainy sea son with a rainfall in August of il.Xfe inches and in September of I l.!f. inches. Finally, in October, the re-cord was again ee-Iipsed. the tetal excavation be ing 1.SGS.729 cubic yards; a truly ex traordinary record, especially in view of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1 inches. In fact, experience during the last two rainy seasons demonstrates that the rains are a less serious ob stacle to progress than has hitherto been supposed. "Work on the locks and dams at (.a tun. which began actively in March last, has advanced so far that it is thought that masonry work on the locks can be begun within lf months. "Iist winter bills wr- reenieste.i and received for doing the work of inal const met ion by contract. None of them was found to be satisfactory and all were r-j ct d. It is the- unanimous opinion of the present commission that the work can b done !ett r. more cheaply, and more quickly 1 the gov ernment than by private e-mt r;n tors. Fuliy SO per cent, of the entire pi.-.'t need.-d for const rue-t ion has b. u p.ir chascd or contracted for. machine shops have been erected and quipped for nmking all needed repairs to th. plant; many thousands ef employes have been secured: an effective eirg.mi ziition has been perfected; a recruiting system is in operation which is capable of furnishing mores labor than cn be used advantageously; employes are well sheltered anil well fed; salaries paid are satisfactory, and the work is not only going forward smoothly but it is producing results far in advance of the most sanguine anticipations. Under these favorable conditions, a change in the method of prosecuting the work would be unwise and unjusti fiable, for it would Inevitably disorgan ize existing conditions, check progress, and increase the cost and lengthen the time of completing the canal. President Recommend Postal Savings Baaka. "I commend to the favorable consid eration of the congress a postal sav ings bank system, as recommended by the postmaster general. The primary object is to encourage among our peo ple economy and thrift and by the use of postal savings banks to give them an opportunity to husband their re sources, particularly those who have not the facilities at hand for depositing their money in savings banks. Viewed, however, from the experience of the past few weeks, it is evident that the ulvantages of such an institution are -till more far-reaching. Timid depos tors have withdrawn their savings for the time being from national banks: in lividuals have hoarded their e-ash and the workingmen their earnings: ail of which money has been withdrawn md kept in hiding or in the safe de posit box to the detriment of pros erlty. Through the agency of the pos tal savings banks such money would be estored to the channels of trade, to ne mutual benefit of capital and labor. "I further commend to the congress he consideration of the postmaster i neral's recommendation for an ex . nsion ef the parcel post. csp dally on the rural routes. There are now 3H.--if rural routes, serving nearly 1T..000.- 00 people who do not have the ad antiiges of the inhabitants of cities in Maining their supplies. These recom- ndations have been drawn up to v lie-tit the farmer and the country lore-kv cper; otherwise. 1 should not avor them, for I believe that it is good olicy for our government to do every hing possible to aid the small town nd the country district. It is ih sirabie :h.tt the country merchant siioultl not e crushed out. "The fourth-class postmasters' con dition has passed a very strong reso ition in favor of placing th- fourth lass postmasters under the civil-serv-ee law. The administration has al- .e-ady put into effect the po.u-y of re using to remove any fourth-class post masters save for re :. sous connee'ted vith the good of the- service; and it is ndeiivoring so far its possible to re- auve them from the domain of nartisan tolitics. It would be a nut eb sirabie thing to put tl: fourth-class pntmas- ters in tiie classified service." He renews his fe e ii.liltu Il.ti: tions of .ast year in regard to Alask:: calls at ention to the- admission of Oklahoma s a state; urges the importance of pro iding shipping relief for Hawaii; asks or citizenship for Porto Ricnns. and romises submission of Secretary faffs report on Philippines when that llicial returns. He asks for the creation of a bureau of mines; recommends the providing of '"unds for preserving The Hermitage, he home of Andrew Jackson: and the rection of a naval monument at Vicksburg. corporation Contribution to CoiuuiiiKn KxpenNeM. "Tinier our form of government voting ;s not merely a right but a duty, and, uioreover. a fundamental and necessary duty if a man is to be a good citizen. It is well te provide that corporations -diall not contribute to presidential or . itional campaigns, and furthermore to provide for the publication of both con . ' illations and expenditures. There is, : twever. always danger in laws of this t.ind. which from their very nature are .hfllcult of enforcement; the danger being lest they be obeyed only by the honest, and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so as to act only as a penalty upon honest men. Moreover, no such law would ham per an unscrupulous man of unlimited means from buying his own way into office-. There is a very radical measure which would. I. believe, work a substan .ial improvement in our system of con ducting a campaign, although I am well .are that it will lake some time for -ople to so familiarize themselves with cl a proposal as to be willing to Con ner its adoption.

"The time has come, in m. judgment. set to work seriously to make our can mail service corn spend mere iosely with our recent commercial i.n.l n-ditical development. A heg.:in"ng was nade by the m ei:n mail act of March r,. s'h but even at that time the act was . .own to be inadequate in various par ticulars. Since that time e-nts have u.oved rapidly in our history. We have 1 qui reel Hawaii, the Philippines, and terser islands in the Pacific. We are '.eadily prosecuting the great work of anting at the Isthmus the waters of the Atlantic- iind the Pacific. To a greater . xtent than seemed probably even a lozen years ago we may look fo an Vmerican future on the sea worthy of he tradition of our past. As the first step in that direction, anel the step most feasible- at the pre-sent time. I recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1MI1. That act has stood for some years free from successful criticism of its prin ciple and purpose. It wsis based on theo ries of the obligations of a gre-at mari inie nation, undisputed in our own land and followed by other nations since the beginning of steam navigation. Hrie-tly those theories are. that it is the duty of a first-class power so far as practicable in carry its ocean mails under its own Hag: that the fast ocean steamships and their crews, rcquire-d for such mail serv ice, are valuable auxiliaries to the s-a power of a nation. Furthermore, tl construction of such steamships insures i he maintenane-e in an e-fli.-ient condition of the shipyards in which eur battle-ships must be built. "The expenditure of public money for the performance of such ne-ce-ssary func tions of gove-rnmcnt is cci 'airily war-rante-el. nor i v in c.-ssary tet dwell upon the incidental benefits our foreign commerce, to the shipbuilding industry, and to ship owning .'inel navigation which will ae-company the discharge if these urg-nt public dufie-s. though th-y. too. should have weight." AmIcm Increase In Pay for riny Officer and Men. The president devotes much space u, the affairs of the army, and strongly urges that our regular military organi zation be kept up to the highest possible standard of efficiency, and says: "The medical corps should he much greater than the needs of our regular army in war. Vet at present it is small er than the needs of the service- demand even in peace. The Spanish war oc curred less than ten years ago. The chief loss we suffered In it was by dis ease among the regiments which never left the country. At the moment the nation seemed deeply impressed by this fact; yet seemingly It has already been 1 forgotten, for not the slightest effort has been made to prepare a medical I corps of sufficient size to prevent the repetition of the same disaster on a much larger scale if we should ever b engaged In a serious conflict. I "But the medical department is not tha i only department for which increased pro ' vision should be made. The rate of pay i for the officers should be greatly in ' creased: there is no higher type of citizen than the American regular officer, and he should have a fair reward for his ad mirable work. There should be a rela tively even greater increase in the pay for the enlisted men. An especial provision should be made for establishing grades equivalent to those of warrant officers in the navy, which should be open to the enlisted men who serve sufficiently long and who do their work well. Inducements should be offered sufficient to encour.ige really good men to make the army a hfe occupation. The prime nee-ds of our pres ent army is to secure and retain compe tent noncommissioned officers. This diffi culty rests fundamentally on the ejiies- ! tion of pay. The noncommissioned oTi er j does not corre-spond with an unskilled la borer: he corresponds to the best X ;c of i skilled workman or to the sub tr.I a -.le. official in civil institutions. Wages i ave i greatly increased in outside occup t ous in the last 40 years and the pay of t . soldier, like 'he pay of the officers, sho Id . be proportionately increased. The first ! sergeant of a company, if a good man, ' must be one of such executive and ad ' ministratlve ability, and such knowledge of his trade, as to be worth far more than we at prercnt pay him. The same is true of the regimental sergeant major. Taesa , men should be men who had fully re ' solved to make the army a life occupa tion and they uhould be able to look for I ward to ample reward: while only men properly qualified should be given a chance to secure these final rewards. The increase over the present pay need not , be great in the lower grades for the first I one or two enlistments, but the increase rhotihl be marked for the noncommis ' s!cned officers of the upper grades o ! :-erve huig enough to make it evident . it ! they intend to stay permanently in the j army, while additional pay should be g'ven for high qualifications in target practice. "Among the: officers there should be severe exar-In-1 ois to weeel out the j unfit up to the grade of major. From ; that position on -ippointments should 1 he solely by selection and it should be t understood that a man of merely av ' erage onaeity could never get beyond ; the position of major, while every man ' who serves in any grade a certain I length of time- prior to promotion to I the next grade without getting the I promotion to the next grade should be ' forthwith retired." j President S'cojc Need of j Largely Increased Nnvjr. ' The president asks for a continuous increase in the navy, and asks present ' congress for appropriations for four . new battleships, and says: i "We need .always to remember that in t!me of war the navy is not to he ' used to defend harbors and sea-coast , cities: we should perfect our system of coast fo-titica tions. The only efficient use fetr the navy hs for offense. The only way in which It can efficiently pro tect our own coast against the possible action of a foreign navy is by destroy ing that foreign navy. For defense against a hostile fleet which actually attacks them, the coast cities must de pend upon their forts, mines, torpedoes, submarines and torpedo boats and de stroyers. All of these together are ef ficient for defensive purposes, but they in no way supply the place of a thor oughly e-:iicic nt navy capable of acting on the offensive: for parrying never yet won a fight. It can only be won by hard luting, and an aggressive sea-going navy alone can dohls hard hitting of the offensive type. But the forts and the like are necessary so that the navy may be footloose. In time of war there is sure to be demand, under pres sure of fright, for the ships to be scat tered so as to defend all kind of ports. Cneler penalty of terrible disaster, this demand must be refused. The ships must be kept together, and their ob jective made the enemies' fleet. If fortifications are sufficiently strong, n modern navy will venture to attack them, so long as the foe has in exist ence a hostile navy of anything like the- same size or efficiency. P.ut unless there exists such a navy then the forti fications are povve-rless by themselves to secure tin- victory. For of course the mere deficiency means that any resolute enemy can at his leisure com bine all his forces upon one point with the c-ertaintv that he can take it. Chen UeasoiiM for Itespatch Of Fleet to Iie Pacific. "I'ntilour battle fleet is much larger than at pres. nt it should never be spht into detachments so fur apart tl:-t they enu'd not in event of erne rg. rr-y be spe. .lily unted. Our coast line i-- on tin Pacific just as much -s on the- At lantic. The ?nfrcst '' California, c u-ei-on and Washington arc as epi phytically the ntere.qs of the whole union as those of Maine ami New Vork. of I. oil is a nil and Texas. The b-itt e fi-et should now and then be moved to the Pacific, just as at other times it should be kept in the At la nth-. When the isthmian canal is built the transit of the battle fleet from one oi-an to tin other will be comr'!"a lively -use. 1'ntii it is built I earnestly hope that the battle fleet will be thus shift, d be tween the two oceans every year or twet. The marksmanship on si II our ships has improved phenomenally dur ing the last five years. FntU within the last two or three years it was not possible to train a battle fleet in squad ron maneuvers under service conditions, and it is only during these last two or three years that the training under these conditions has become really ef fective. Another and most necessary stride In advance is now being taken, 'the battle fleet is about starting by the Straits of Magellan to visit the Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships are going under the command of Rear Ad miral Evans, while eight armored cruisers and two other battleships will meet him at San Francisco, whither certain torpedo destroyers are also go ing. No fleet of such size has ever made such a voyage, and it will be of very great educational use to all n-gag'-d in it. The- only way by which to teach officers and men how to handle the fleet so as to me-et every posil b strain and emergency in time of war is to Have them practice under similar conditions in time f peace. Mor-ov -r. tin- only way to find out our a'tual needs is to perform in time of p-ace whatev r maneuvers might he n ces siiry in time of war. After war is de clared it is too late to find out the needs; that means to invite Jisi t r t The trip te the Pacific- will show what i some of our needs are and will ibb j us to provide- for tin m.
