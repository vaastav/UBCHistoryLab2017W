No recommendation of the President's message should receive more prompt and favorable at tention from Congress than that relating to Philippine trade. Peace and order being pretty well established in the archipelago — only by the criminal classes or by outbreaks of the peasantry against the oppression of native of ficials, the choice of whom had. been intrusted to the Filipinos by our too rapid extension of self government—tbe Philippine problem has become chiefly economic. The happiness and <ontent ajent of the people depend on their prosperity. The development of the country and the building of roads and schools require a revenue which can be secured without inflicting hardship on the people only when Industry and commerce are re vived. Therefore in justice to them and to pro mote the success of an enterprise in which the national good name is bound up we should open to them markets and encourage their industry. The President urges that all products of the Philippines, except sugar and tobacco, be admit mi free into the United States, aud that on these two products the duties be reduced to 25 per cent of the rate* of the Dingley law until July. 19», and then be removed. This recom mendation has been urged before in vain, but it Is to be hoj>ed that the visit of members of Con press to Manila will be found to have given them a larger view of their duty. The President chows that there is little prospect that even ab solute and lMtoediate free trade in sugar ami tobacco would injure our own Industries. Con ditions there ere so primitive and the labor proh iem presents so many difficulties that any enor / — aious development of production is out of the question Access to our markets on favorable terra* would give reasonable profit to those now engaged in agriculture, but the difficulties in the wsv of embarking rtp-.v capital would prevent any revolutionary development. Moreover, the great- NKW 

YORK DAILY TRHU'XE. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 9. !**>& est good to be expected from the concession Is sentimental. It would bo considered by the people a measure of justice and good will. It would give new hope and new courage. Not less important in justice to the Filipinos is the postponement of the operation of the coast wise laws of the United States over the trade be tween our home ports and the Philippines. The act of 1004 provided that the coastwise laws should become operative on July 1. 1900, and the President asks that this -date be postponed to July 1. 1900. It would be obviously unjust to treat the Philippine trade as domestic while im posing customs duties upon it. Tbe coastwise laws would confine this trade across the Pacific Ocean, which has always been open to the ships of the world, to a few vessels and enable thgJc owners to charge exorbitant rates to the fur ther discouragement of Philippine commerce. No such monopoly should be allowed, and the least we can do in decency is to leave the Filipinos to ship as they will until we have developed Pacific transportation facilities of our own as good and cheap as they can secure anywhere and have given them the privileges of our domestic com mercial system. THE WAR OV 

TUBERCULOSIS. A particularly instructive exhibition has been in progress at the American Museum of Natural History for nearly a fortnight, and will close to morrow evening. It embraces a variety of ma terial illustrating the conditions which encour age the spread of tuberculosis and the modern methods of fighting that malady. There can he no doubt that the exhibition has drawn much ju tention to the curability of a disease from which recovery was once believed to he impossible and to stimulate intelligent effort to Suppress it. It has enforced Ihe lesson that dark and badly ventilated tenements censtltute the most favor able environment for tbe domination of "the great white plague," and that the proper weap ons wherewith to end Its sway are not drugs or gnses, but rest, good food and plenty of fresh air. The number and character of the persons who have been studying this collection suggest the propriety of installing it permanently in some convenient place in this city and thus Increasing its educational value. There (voukl be great fit ness, moreover, in having the necessary pro* vision made under municipal auspices. Warfare on tuberculosis may be regarded not only as a legitimate function, but also as a solemn duty of the government of every large city; for it is prevalent chiefly In those unsuitable places of residence for the jioorer classes which are pecul iar to large centres of population. The respon sibility of New- York becomes especially obvious when it is remembered that not far from thirty thousand persons are sick here with consump tion at one time, and that the malady annually causes no fewer than ten thousand deaths in tbe metropolis. Already th» health ofticers of other cities and men nnd women who wish to study the most ef fective methods of administrative control find it advantageous to come and'examine the work done by Dr. Herman A. Biggs, of the New- York Health Department. An exceptional object les son is afforded by the tuberculosis hospitals and dispensaries of the city, and several of the hest known sanatorlums in the country are easily ac cessible from this joint. A fresh attraction to students of the general subject would be afforded if the exhibition at the Museum of Natural His tory oould be established on a permanent busts. Cannot the Health Commissioner and the chief bacteriologist of the Health Department prevail on the Board of Estimate and Apportionment to co-operate with them for the adoption of the necessary measures? CHTRCH AM) STATE TS FRAXCE. The adoption of the bill for the separation of church and state in France is achieved at last, and that epoch marking measure will at once go into effect. It has been so long before Parlia ment and the people for consideration that no body can call it an act of haste, and during the protracted debate there has been developed so little popular opposition to it that we must re gard it hs on the whole satisfactory to the na tion. It will be observed that the Senate, which had already adopted by a practically unanimous vote some of the clauses which had been most hotly contested in the Chamber of Deputies, passed the bill on its final reading hy the sub stantial majority of 70 In a total vote of 253. For better or for worse, then, France lias com mitted herself to this act. l*i>on the face of it the act seems a radical one, and we are told that because of it the state will henceforth he entirely free from connection with religious sects. That seems to us a slight over statement of the case, and we are Inclined to think tbe chief criticism which will presently be passed upon the measure will be that it is not sufficiently radical. It certainly does not seem to fulfil Cavour's ideal of a "free church in a free state." The state may lie free enough, though it will continue to pay millions of dollars a year for the support of churches. The various churches certainly will not be free. The new law provides for a stringent system of state supervision over them, even to providing the manner in which tUeir properties shall he held and administered, and the state undertakes to see to it that all religious associations are "legal "ly established in conformity with the general "regulations of the form of worship the exercise "of which they propose to maintain." That is to say. Catholic and Episcopalian churches must obey their bishops Implicitly and completely or the state will not authorize their continued ex istence. These restrictions and provisions may be nec essary in the circumstances now prevailing in France. They certainly make church freedom in that country far less <>omplete than ir is here. Nevertheless, the new law is a long step in the direction of cut in* freedom, and its educational and disciplinary effects may prove to be of great value. So far us it puts an end to the mingling of political and ecclesiastical intrigues, it will be a good thing for both church and state. ■HOME RILE BLOCKS THE WAY." It was Mr. (Jladstone who declared that Home Uule for Ireland was and must be the cardinal item of the Liberal programme, and that until it was satisfactorily disposed of it would neces sarily block the way against all other Impor tant legislation. That remained true in his time. After his retirement Home Rule was practi cally shelved by the party he hail led. For ten years now that party has been out of office and in a state of demoralization, some of Its lead ers still professing devotion to the Gladstonian policy n f Home Rule rtnd others opposing it as resolutely as the Unionists themselves. To day, with the gates of office reopenei to it and with a prospect of success at the polls, the Lib eral party finds Mr. Gladstone's words still true, though in a different sense from that which he intended. ••Home Rule blocks the way." hut it is the, way to completeness of the Lilieral triumph which it blocks, and the way to Liberal i.» uuion. There, were intimations of that fact some days ago. in various utteranct-H of Liberal leaders, albeit Lord Kosebery, perhaps the most determined opponent of Home Hule in tho party, did urge the holding of that and all dis puted matters in abeyance until after election. But the Irish leaders themselves have force! tbe hand of the Liberal party. In iheir Nation alist convention they have formally declare.! their distrust of Liberal promises, and their unwillingness to support a Liberal, government unless it iiiaki'K Home Rule for Ireland the "cardinal point of its programme." And wh;it they now mean by Home Rule in something not one whit !e«« radical than that proposed by Mr. Qtftdstona. Sir Henry Campbell Ranncrman is snid to have explained his Irish policy satisfactorily to his colleagues— meaning, we aKKUtue, Mr. Mor« ley, Mr. Asquith ami Sir Edward Grey, but probably not Lord Kosebery. That, however, fs not the all-important tiling. The question is whether his policy is satisfactory to the Irish leaders. If not. according to the resolution framed by the Lord Mayor of Dublin and unanimously adopted by the Nationalist con vention, the new Liberal government cannot expect the permanent support of the fourscore Irish members of the House of Commons. anil without thai rapport its Chances of controlling the House are obviously small. It seems scarce ly possible thai tbe Liberals, can make a net gain of 150 seats in a lions? of 670 members, yet it would lie necessary for them ♦<> do so in order to secure a bare majority. Perhaps the most serious feature of the ease, from an electioneering point of view, is the effect this Irish demand and declaration will have upon the electorate during the campaign. The Irish will press the Liberals for an un equivocal statement of policy on Home Rule. The Liberal answer must be one of three. If it is indefinite with no positive committal, the Irish will be alienated from the beginning, and the Liberals must win I~>o additional seats or be without a majority. If it is a definite answer not committing the party to Home Rule as the "cardinal point of its programme," the result will be the same. If it is a definite compliance with the Irish demand, there will surely be an other schism in the Liberal party. In that case, supported by the Irish vote. the Liberals would need to win only seventy seats to have a ma jority, hut there would be some doubt about their doing so In the fave of a party schism. In any case, there is the possibility that a number of voters will fear that Liberal success would mean either a surrender to the Home Rule de mand, or the giving of the balance of power to the Irish members and consequently much insta bility in ttie House, and will, therefore, vote for the Consorvati' c candidates ns the surest way of averting such an unwished for state of affairs — just as many Republicans in this city last month voted for Mr. .McClellan as the surest way of defeating Mr. Hearst. It is in such circum stances that the spectre of Home Rule, which Mr. Gladstone conjured up. still blocks the way to the complete unity of the Liberal party. X WEPI KG CA M PA I<! X /'/. El) (1 BS. State Treasurer Bripjxs, as chairman of the New-Jersey Republican State Committee, has Issued an address to the various county chair, men recalling the pledges on which the party appealed to the voters last year and pointing out what has been done in the way of fulfilment Very properly he lays emphasis on the question of equal taxation. Regarding this proposition, be recites the fact that the Republican platform pledged the party to the passage of an act tax ing second class railroad property al local rates and promising to make immiry as to the best means of brtagtag nil railroad property to an equality In the matter of taxation. Mr. Briggs says that the pledges have been kept; the sec ond class railroad legislation has been enacted, and at the coming session of the legislature sat isfactory laws will he passed concerning the tax ation of other railroad property. That is satisfactory so far ns it goes, but Major Briggs forgets to mention the Hillery act, which was intended to nullify the second class railroad property taxation law. The value of this prop erty is assessed by a state board, so that the local assessors cannot fix tbe valuation, and the purpose of the Hillery act was to provide a maximum tax rate. If this rate failed to pro vide enough revenue for the purposes of munici pal government nothing remains but to increase the valuations on everything but railroad prop erty, over which the lo«al assessors have no con trol. While that condition exists the alleged equalisation of. taxation is more apparent than real, and Mr. Briggs might well use his influence to have the Hillory ad subterfuge abolished. Major Briggs is undoubtedly right about the strong and constantly growing public sentiment against perpetual franchises, and his prompt recognition of the wisdom of legislating in ac cordance therewith is testimony to his politi cal judgment. He is keen enough to understand tlini the people are in no temper to be fooled and that they will insist on every campaign pledge being kept in letter and spirit. It is a pity that he could not nee his way to join the forces aligned under Senator-elect Colby. They sjteak. unquestionably, for practically the whole of Northern New-Jersey on the Questions <>f taxa tion, franchises and anti-bossiam, and the ideas which they represent are sure, sooner or later, to dominate the whole state. Possibly before the legislative session is far advanced Mr. Briggs may l>e found working with them shoulder to shoulder. He would surely he a valuable acqui sition to their ranks, and his activity on their side could not help increasing the popularity of the state organization. IMMIGRATION AM) SELFISHNESS. There was an element of novelty in the dis cussion of immigration on the opening day of the national conference on that question in that some of the principal speakers in advo cating the encouragement rather than the re striction of immigration assumed a distinctly selfish Instead of an altruistic attitude. They argued for keeping the gates wide open, not to afford an asylum to the oppressed of other lands', but in order to gain for America the working power and the wealth which Immi grants bring hither. That is a practical atti tude, and Is at least as worthy of consideration iis that of the more sentimental altruist. The chief Question concerning it is. however, wheth er it is warranted by tbe facts of the case. It may be doubted whether this country is. as Mr. Carnegie intimated, draining the hest blood of Europe. Years ago it did so, no doubt. Two generations ago, nearly, in the days of Euro pean revolutionary movements, it did so. as Professor I^oel) pointed out. It may be doing so to-day, to a limited extent. But it seems simply impossible to regard the great masses of immigrants, ignorant, unclean and impover ished, as the "best blood" of th<»ir native coun tries. A country whose "best Mood" was of no hotter quality than -that could not continue to exist. There is what we must regard as pretty convincing evidence {hat many immigrants. perhaps a majority of those from certain lands, come from the less desirable, the less Intelligent, the less thrifty and the loss moral elements of their population. If so. we cannot regard it as profitable for this country to receive them. There is room for doubt, also, as to whether this country is really so new. so unsettled and so undeveloped as to need a great influx of alien labor. In most of the large cities and in many of the states well founded complaints of overcrowding and of overstocking of the lalmr market are made. A redistribution of existing forces would be beneficial, through which work ing man would be transferred from congested districts to those in which h scarcity of indus trial energy is felt. Hut that end is not to he reached by inviting in unlimited numbers from abroad, most of whom persist in settling in the congested districts. Nor are we sure that there "should be haste to fill up all the empty places and develop all our resources in a day. We must, as Cartier said, respect the future. Our Constitution w;is ordained to 'secure the Bless ings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity." and if may be well to leave some of our ma terial inheritance for our own posterity to de velop. Instead ( f parcelling it all out at once among aliens. National growth by increase from within may hp slower, but is more sub stantial than Hint e.ff«ntod by injection from without. Then- can be no thought of putting a stop to all immigration. But neither should there be any thought of removing or lessening the h> strictions now put upon it. On the contrary, we are persuaded that, from ft? legitimate point of view of our own national welfares moral, industrial, social and political— it is more desirable to pstH* f'irtlier than to enlarge op portunities for immigration. There appears to have been no doubt whatever that the woman hanged in Vermont yesterday was guilty of the murder of her husband and that the crime was committed In a particularly cold blooded, deliberate and revolting manner for purposes of the most depraved description. There wa« no feature of it and no circumstance connected with It that in thf least degree pal liated the enormity of the crime or that sug gested the slightest extenuation. It would not be just to dismiss the unwelcome theme without a word concerning the action of Governor Bell of Vermont. Seldom if ever has a chief execu tive been confronted with a more distasteful duty than that which came to him. The senti ments of chivalry which would move a man to treat with kindness even the most worthless woman, the realization that by executing the law he would make of himself a target for bitter denunciation and obloquy— these and a great array of other motives were doubtless strong: In his mind. Above them all. however, prevailed his sense of duty— the obligation to execute the law. It was not for htm to try the woman nor to pass sentence upon her. Those things were done l>y another and co-ordinate branch of the government. Neither was it for him. on grounds ot sentiment or personal feelins, to set aside the solemn decree oT justice. It was for him to execute the law, and in performing that duty, in circumstances of peculiar painfulness. he set an example of official fidelity and integrity worthy of the highest praise and the widest emulation. The sudden and tragic death of Mr James Russell Parsons in Mexico is fin incident com manding something more than passing regretr. Mr. Parsons was a man of high attainments and ability, who for a number of years rendered im portant and lasting services to the cause of edu cation in this state, who had more recently served the nation .is consul general with fidelity and discretion, and who personally possessed many engaging traits of character and lived a blameless life. His death is a private bereave ment and a public loss. President Roosevelt won the respect and ad miration of every soldier of "the lost cause" by one paragraph in his annual message — that re lating to Confederate dead, especially those who died in Northern prisons. Magnanimity is never' better displayed than when its results tend strongly tow.ard obliterating sectional lines and making all feel they are brothers of a common household and fellow citizens of one common country. Speaker Cannon has already intimated that for the present the country will have to get along with the federal buildings now in use. The "pork barrel" will contain small consolation next year for new Representatives who are gal lantly standing 'Tor the flag — and an appropria tion." It seems to he impossible to require high enough cash bail to induce the Tammany "worker"' who Is wanted in court to stay and ser what it is the court wants. His suspicions evidently are well based. It would be interesting to know Counsel Park er's real opinion of the law Justice Parker laid down and which circumstances now require him to oppose. Football as played has been condemned. The nnly Qtiestton nnw seems to he whether, upon promise of amendment, it can b* reprieved. Thr p^w U-lephore has arrived -in Kast Orange. And some people still have the impression that Jersey is slow. The Sultan and the powers seem in a fair way to get together amicably— in appearance, at least.
