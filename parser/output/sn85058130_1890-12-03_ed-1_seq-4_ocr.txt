KOULE in speaking of Utah contains the following from the report of the Utah commission to the secretary If the Mormon church would declare against polygamy there is little doubt but that the people would generally accept the declara tion as binding upon them but insteaa of doing this every effort of the government to suppress the crime is denounced as per secution This was written by the Utah commis sion just before the issuance of the anti polygamy manifesto and was accompanied I by a recommendation for additional legisla tion The commission based their claim for the necessity of additional legislation OH their belief that fortyone male per sons have contracted plural marriages since Tune 1S The Mormon church has declared against polygamy and there has been no evidence forthcoming as to the fortyone male per sons whom the commissioners said they be lieved had contracted plural marriages Secretary NOBLE has this to say of Utah affairs The present laws should not however be changed on these professions alone These can be unmade by the same body that has made them The revela tion sanctioning polygamy remains un changed The Mormons by their works must prove their declarations to be made in good faith t The Mormons would not ask more than this They desire a chance to prove their sincerity Polygamy included there has been less lawbreakingamong the Mor mons than among any other western com munity of the same sizeBut the government has decreed that polygamy should cease anO the Mormons after the prosecutions for polygamy had almost ceased for sheer want of material to work upon came for ward in a very unambiguous manner and declared their intention to obey the law They dd not do this in the first place be cause they thought they should show their loyalty to a principle of their religion and suffer for it if necessary After practic ally all violators of the law had been pun ished for their acts then and not till then did the Mormons pronounce against poly gamy To have yielded earlier than they did would have looked like cowardice in refusing to take the consequences of their acts To have held out longer would have shown that they were not good citizens and not willing to obey any law that did not suit them In no other way could the Mormons have been absolutely loyal to their religion and at the same time absolutely loyal to the government The government has seen fit to require of the Mormons that they be better in every respect than the people of any other section The Mormons agree to the condi tions imposed and ask leave to be per mitted to attempt the gauntlet They agree and will endeavor to live up to that agreement that in the future they will not only as they have in the past live better lives on the whole than those not of their faith but they agree further to do away with the only conspicuous species of law breaking that has ever characterized them the practice of polygamy This we think should be all that need be required of them We say to the nation If you will require that the Mormons live stricter lives than any other denomina tion on the continent at least give them a chance to carry out your be hests Do not now punish them for what 5 ou imagine they may do They ask that they ba judged by their actions It is with only a natural surprise and pain therefore that many of the people here detect in the Presidents message a suggestion that the people of Utah be still further afflicted by some sort of degrada thin that will punish them in advance for actions it is supposed they may be guilty of in the future

MONEY IN CIKC ORATION Not long since the Tribune roundly l abused us lor publishing in answer to some of its assertions the official figures of the in crease qf our circulating currency as com pared with our increase of population The Tribune asserted that by the demonetiza I tion of silver the circulating currency had been reduced about 30 per cent as com pared with the increased population As the official figures we published did not bear out the truth of this statement the organ flew into a rage and quoted some re marks trom the St Louis GlobeDemocrat to i prove its assertion as against us and the official figures We studied this quotation and were unable to see in what way it i strengthened the Tribune theory except in a few words attributed to some one else But now comes the GlobeDemocrat the silver and monetary authority of the Triii unc to which it flew in hot haste when cor nered by the official figure vith the fol lowing editorial statement on this matter The Atlanta Constitnion declares that the currency of the country has been steadily con tract d ror a quarter of a century The Con ttf niton is the Pue of the southern section of the country In the past dozen years the ratio of the growth in the currency has been more than twice as great as that In population It will be seen that the position of the GlobeDemocrat is utterly at variance with that of the Tribune The latter will not quote the former again to show that the currency has shrunk 150 per cent through the demonetization of silver Now neighbor do let us hear from you in regard to this matter STILL THE question is what is the in I port of the lresidents reference to Utah I CLEAn AXU able in other respects the reference to Utah is decidedly ambiguous I WILL GAG law be adopted in the Senate I There will be a line opportunity for Demo I cratic oratory and patriotism to manifest itself on the motion to adopt rules by which V debate can be cut off HL IS 

INNOCEM Public sympathy will go out to exCon ductor CUtw now that it appears there is little or no evidence against him and a general feeling of regret will result that charges of so serious a nature were mado against him openly without reservation or qualification and given to the public papers as an assured fact when they were only mere suspicions How meagre must have been the ov dene against him is indicated by the fact that he was not even held to answer after the preliminary examination A workingmans reputation is his stock intrade as well as his guarantee of recog nition by honorable people and to injure his reputation by serious charges unsup ported by evidence is a wrong of more than ordinary gravity We trust that the in jured man will as quickly recover among strangers the vantage ground of honorable prestige as he already has among his I friends TIll DnKVER JVcics has a story that the Mormons in the vicinity of Eagle Rock are making desperate efforts to prevent Gen tile capatalists from makin land entries in that section the country The des perate efforts according to tho story consist in a statement said to have been made by the Mormons that some of thc land entries were fraudulent SENATOR EDMUNDS recently remarked that he was thankful the Senate is still a deliberative body How deep his thank fulness was will presently appear The vote to adopt REEDS rules for the Senate will probably soon be taken TUE LOCAL Republican organ does not agree with the Presidents recommenda tion for the passage of the force bill IT 

SEEMS very difficult says the New I York Times to get into the minds of busi ness menat least of those whom admir I ing neighbors send to Congress the fact J that the great mass of business in this country is done not with money but with credit based directly on commodities or I on securities which in their turn owe their I origin to commodities There is a preva lent idea that finds hospitality in some brains that ought to be absolutely inac cessible to it that more money will raise prices stimulate business and pro mote prosperity Yet we have had strik ing instances within a very few years in our own country of great changes in tte activity of business in the course of prices and in general prosperity changes great in one direction and then in the op posite without any material change in the amount of money in birculatiou or available for circulation Tho Times evidently hafe neighbors as dense as our morning contemporary temporary THE EASTERN PRESS Philadelphia Times Senator Cullom thinks that the McKinley bill needs revamping vamping When now soles heels uppers eyelets and laces are also added it will be a serviceable affair Louisville CourierJournal Lije Hal fords Thanksgiving will be slightly marred jy the reflection that in 92 he will no longer receive a salary of 6000 a year But Mr Halford should remember all the good ho has done while he has been in tho White House St Louis GlobeDemocrat Rep We hope that President Harrison in his forthcoming coming message to Congress will not neglect to remind the party in control that the scheme of tariff revision by marking duties upward instead of downward is played out in this country New York World Tho Republican phari sees have the same keen sense of duty as the Alabama aunty Lor Mis Carline aid the old woman when reprimanded for going to prayer meeting with a stolen fowl under her arm you tink I let sech a ting as a ole goose stan tween me an my ligion 1 Boston 7rmlscrilt A reviewer of Ward McAllisters muchtalkedof book remarks in the ChrIstian Lniou that the one man who could have done fullest justice to that astounding production Society as I Have Found It has passed away and the gayety of nations must forever remain the smaller bj tho loss of Thackerays comments upon i I it I Keokuk Gate City Rep The Gate CilI and its editor was one of those Re publicans that helped make the Republican arty and its policy when it used to sweep the country from end to end election after election aud when Iowa used to give from 50000 to 80000 majority We are getting tired of seeing the Republican party run by halfstoryheaded idiots Baltimore SUIlThe people are tired of prosperity produced by taxation TI o prosperity is well enough as far as it goes but the trouble aboutprotectionist prosper ity is that it is felt only in spots while the poverty it causes is generally diffused What is wanted is a kind of taxation that I
