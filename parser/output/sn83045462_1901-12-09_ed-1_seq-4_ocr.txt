The Supreme Court in last Monday's opinions rounded out its decisions in the Insular tariff cases and reaffirmed its pre vious declarations concerning the relations between the United States and the new in sular posse=ions. The court had decided in May in De Lima vs. Bidwell that Porto Rico was not a "foreign country" under the Dingley tariff act, and in December in the Pepke case it makes the same declara lion concerning the Philippines, brushing aside all attempts to discriminate the case of the Asiatic archipelagd from that of the West Indies -island. Similarly the court ha4 in May declared in Downes vs. Bidwell that Porto Rico was not "within the United States" as those words are used in the rev enue uniformity clause of the Constitution, and that consequently the Foraker act im posing duties upon importations Into the United States from Porto Rico was consti tutional: and now in December In the sec ond Dooley case it reaffirms and extends the decision in Downes vs. Bidwell, and sus tains the constitutionality of the Foraker act in imposing duties upon importations from the United States into Porto Rico. The same five judges who made the de cision in Do Lima vs. Bidwell reaffirm it in the Pepke case; and the same five judges who rendered the court's decision in Downes vs. Bidwell unite in the judgment along the same lines in the second Dooley case. Nobody has changed his mind. The law concerning the relations of the republic and its dependencies as laid down in May is the law today. The court's decision In the Pepke case, declaring the status of the Philippines to be precisely that of Porto Rico. throws on Congress the urgent and immediate obliga tion of providing for the Asiatic archipel ago a Foraker act, determining its political, Commercial and administrative relations to the United States. The decision places Philippine affairs among the most pressing of legislative issues. It revives political and popular interest In the concerns of our Asiatic dependencies. In order to avoid groping in the dark in legislating for the public welfare along the lines laid down by the Supreme Court in the insular cases Congress is compelled carefully to review again. the net results of the opinions ren dered by the court in declaring the rela tions of appurtenant and incorporated American territory. Elsewhere in The Star is printed the first of two articles designed to show through analysis of the insular decisions the char acteristics of the status of appurtenant ter ritory, a national limbo now first authori tatively defined by the Supreme Court of the United States. The occupants of this American territorial status, the term of their occupancy, their restrictions and their privileges are noted, and finally in a second article the benefits derived both by the United States and its insular possessions from the existence of this political purga tory will be considered. Brasen Anarchists. The police of Cleveland are to be com amended for their action yesterday in pre venting the holding of a meeting of the "Liberty Association," an organization of arowed anarchists. It was this band of yeds that taught Leon Czolgosz the doc trines which later led him to assassinate the President. It is considered a dangerous body and has been watched closely by the police since the tragedy of September. Its effrontery in seeking to hold public meet ings is. perhaps, to be accounted for by the fact that thus far the law has been unable to reach the reds in any city, save in New York. where John Most was sentenced to a short prison term for publishing an in fLammatory editorial in his Journal. Chi cago was impotent to hold Emma Goldman and her associates, and since their release they have participated in more than one meeting at which the radical beliefs of the anarchists were freely expressed. The cli unax of this impudent defiance of the pub lic patience was reached the other night, 'when at a meeting of the central body of Chicago anarchists the man Isaaks, who was arrested with Goldman after the as sassination, declared that he held himself below Czolgoaz, whereat there were cheers for the assnasn. If the law is so lax as to permit such an exhibition of exultation over a deed which has horrified humanity, Its amendment is a mtter of the most urgent necessity. If on the other hano there are laws and ordi nances in force in Chicago to prohibit dis orderly assemblage, or utterances calcu lated to Incite riot or crime, as surely there must be. why were they not applied in stantly upon the utterance of these senti ments. which called forth the clamor of praise for Czolgosa? The leaders of the meeting were all notorious anarchists. To permit them to continue unmolested to defy public decency and the principles of order Is to encourage them to more flagrant out bursts of contempt for government, per haps even to sow the seeds of murder in many hearts. Chicago's mayor is the son of a man who, holding the same office, was killed by a "crank." a man without respect for authority, whose datardly inspiration came, in all probability, from the "red" company he had been keeping. This coun try would respect Carter Harrison far more than it does today if, at the first whisper of treasonable applause for the assassin of the President, he had caused the arrest of the leaders in the demonstration and their immediate prosecution under any ap plicable statute or ordinance. Now and then some publie man gets a great deal of unjust criticism for mistakes which his opponents take It for granted he i suing to make, The Sofag'e Qmestlen. The reply to Mr. Moody's suffrage resolu tio)n comes from Mr. Flening of Georgia, and is as follows: "Whereas the constitutona of the state of Ilassachusetts, In contravention of the pro vision of the federal Constitution. impioses additonal enualeatones fer suffrage by de claring that no person shall have the right to vote who shall net be able to read the Constitution in the English language and write hsname: "Resolved. That when the said select om mittee shall be apoenet.d it shall be this House, and whether the number of tepresentatives from maid Mtate should not be sedued. The press report states that "Mr. Moody takes no exemtion to Mr. Fieming's rsolu-, tion. He is ibMig to hees M==abi..n. take the sme tranmt.

And why should't Be? Why should not the whele country want soe a deal? The great smajority of repuhlanm today are of opinion that the putting of the ballot into the heads of en recently mancipated by war was a mistiake. It Injured those who received quite as much as those whO gave. The soutbern democrats, to a man, denmee the act as the greatest crime in American history, and they cAim justiaca tion for taking the ballot away from the negroes by asserting that the negroes have proved themselves to be wholly unworthy of It. Now whether the act was a great mis take or not the present representation In the lower house of Congress and in the electoral college Is based upon it. The south's present political ppwer is derived from hundred of thousands of people to whom she will not allow a voice in her local affairs. Should the volume of her voice In national affairs be longer swelled by theL : Is it fair that this mistake be remedied, in a purely local way, and yet continue In operation In a national way? If the negroes in the south are unfit to par ticipate in the election of a precinct magis trate or constable, or in the framing of dog laws or road laws, should they vote by proxies-and such proxies as they woui not themselves choose-for President of the United States, and for swamping the credit of the nation with free silver and break ing down American industrial supremacy with free trade? For It Is a fact, easily demonstrated, that the negro vote in the south, counted in the. electoral college against the negro's will, twice made Grover Cleveland President, and, counted in Con gress against his will, repeatedly passed a free coinage bill through the House, and wrote the Gorman-Wilson tariff abortion on the statute books of the United States. Why not a fair suffrage deal from Maine to Texas, from New York to California? What is paramount in the United States to an express provision of the Constitution of the United States? Bourke Coeran as Adviser. Bourke Cochran's claims to consideration as an orator are undisputed. He has voice, assurance, and vocabulary, and as a phrasemaker, pure and simple, he has few equals. Of his claims to consideration as an adviser in public affairs so much may not be said. It was only last year that he was advocating Bryanism, and only last month that he was on the stump in New York city urging the success at the polls of Tammany Hall. Fresh from those two failures Mr. Cock ran seeks now to disturb the peace be tween the United States and Great Britain. He gives out that his sympathies are with the Boers In South Africa, and he wants the war stopped. Somebody must suf render, and as the Boers won't, Great Brit ain should. And in order to bring Great Britain to a realizing sense of things he would have the word spoken here in the United States. Hear Mr. Cockran on that point: "Providence has so ordered events that the President of the United States can compose this bitter quarrel. It is an ex traordinary opportunity offered to an ex traordinary man. It would not be neces sary to draw the sword, to make any threat of armed intervention, or to take an unfriendly attitude. One word spoken to the English ambassador, or in the hea Ing of the English nation, would restore peace, establish justice, secure liberty to these burghers,. promote enormously the prosperity of the human race, and bring Immeasurable glory to the American na tion. Will that word be spoken? Never In history have such momentous results hung on the lips of a human being. Will Theo dore Roosevelt improve this opportunity for himself, his country and the whole human race?". This sort of stuff is unworthy of serious consideration. It goes with a whoop at a public meeting where everybody Is of one mind and argument Is tabooed, but exam ined for a moment in the light of the actual facts it is found to be sheer nonsense. The President of the United States, as Mr. Cockran well knows, could not afford to speak any such word, and were he to do so the effect would not be peace for-the Boers but war for the United States. We have already In the only possible way proffered our good offices to Great Britain in the premises, and they have been politely de clined. That is more than Holland, or France, or Germany, or Italy, or any other European country where lip service for the Boers is so cheap and plentiful, has done. Shall we renew our offer In the form of a threat? It could not be renewed in any other form. Is there any reason why we should take this war off the hands of Mr. Kruger and his salaried buglemen trotting about in Europe? Mr. Cockran is entitled to his opinions in the matter of South Africa-if he really has any. But when he seeks to embroil the United States in a war with Great Britain over any cause now existing, he but gives evidence of how subordinate his intelli gence is to his tongue, and of how little his advice Is to be trusted. He raises the question of his common sense or sincerity, and he suffers, no matter how the question is decided. In the rush to secure positions In the coronation ceremonies, a man of distin guished lineage was refused'the honor of officiating as carver at the banquet for the commonplace reason that he did not know how to carve. This looks like another vic tory for the principle of fitness for office. Some manuscripts of Richard Wagner are said to have been discovered In use as cov erings for jam pots. The story was prob ably started by a French writer as an In sidious and cruel method of shocking Ger many's musiclanly pride. There was a time when a man who had too much to say was simply told to hire a hall. The authorities of Cleveland, Ohio, have decided that this privilege Is too much to be extended to anarchists. A Georgia railroad has managed to main tain the proposition that history repeats It self by bringing forward a deadly car-stove incident once more. It is barely possible that if anarchists are refused permission to exercise their lungs In publie they' will leave this country of their own accord.

As Mr. Byan is not restrained by the formalities of an offlelal position it Is not to be expected that he will- centent hmself with a single message to Congress. It remains to be seen how far fame in this Congress will depend on the kind of a necktie or boutonniere a man wears. Even so admired and exalted a personage 4a Queen Wilheaina of Holland is not proof against neighborhood gossip. Mr. Quay goes to Florida, apparently without any fear of what Governor Stone may do in his absence. 

SHOOTING. STARS. Locating the Blame. "It must be confessed that the climate is rather uncertain," remarked the visitor. "You are one of the few discerning men I have had the good fortune to meet," an swered the weather prophet. "I have often tried to make it clear that, my predictions are correct and reliable and that It is the miserable climate that refuses to subordi nate itself to the simplest rules of mathe matics." Betraying His Ignoramee. "I am always putting my foot in it," said Mr. Cumrox, sadly. "What's the trouble?" "I am always displaying the fact that I have no taste or refinement. Mrs. C. asked me which of two gowns I preferred and I immediately betrayed my Ignorance. I ad mired the one which cost at least 75 less than the other." Incongrauity. This world delights strange pranks to play And bid the weak rejoice; The man who has the least to say Oft has the biggest voice. A Modernist. "I don't believe," said the very thoughtful person, "that the statesmen of the present day are as far-seeing as those of & genera tion ago." "You are making a grave, but common mistake," answered Senator Sorghum. "It is wrong to assume that the modern in telligence is 'Inferior. Thdse old-timers could make good speeches, but as I read history, I can see lots of chances to get rich that they overlooked." A Matter of Principle. "Is you all gwine to hang up any mistle toe dis Christmas?" asked Mr. Erastus Pinkley. "Deed I lsn'," answered Miss Miami Brown. "I's got a little too much pride to advertise foh de ordinary courtesies dat a lady has a right to expect." Excessive Sympathy. I am very sympathetic; 'tis my nature so to be. I am filled with true compassion for most everything I see. When a difference arises 'tis my custom and my pride To tender my devotion to the unsuccessful side. My friends sometimes assure me that my philanthropic dreams Occasionally lead me to extravagant ex tremes. But I still maintain an obstinate adherence to my creed. The only things worth praising are the thirigs that don't succeed. I am sorry for the microbe that our chem ists all assail; We plot 'gainst his existence and we flout him and we rail: He simply tries to get his humble living day by day. If we were microbes we would hate to be abused that way. We rise and shoot the mad-dog when we see him on the run. Although perhaps he only tries to bite us just for fun. I'm sorry for the public when I see how oft we mls Such gloriotis opportunities for sympa thetic bliss. The Union Station.. From the Philadelphia Press. The friendly conference between Presi dent Cassatt of the Pennsylvania railroad and the members of the Senate committee on the District of Columbia and certain of the architectural experts who are work ing upon the problem of a new Washing ton seems to augur well for the future in the matter of an adequate, convenient and architecturally beautiful "union depot" at the nation's capital. Both the officials of the Baltimore and Ohio and those of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company have been perfectly willing to admit that the Wash intton terminals of these 'roads are far from meeting the situation. , Owing to the conflict of rival interests and to the lack of plan on the part of Congress, what are manifestly makeshift depots have endured until the Immediate present. If, how'ever, all parties agree on the new site gjn the northeast corner of Massachusetts avenue and North Capitol street, and the beauti ful and commodious "union depot" that has been designed already ls'brected there, the capital will at least ha're a railroad depot worthy of It. The proposea site is just four blocks north of the Capitol and is sixteen blocks due east of the White H-ouse, either along F or G street. It is on property now partly occupied by the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and hence involves no invasion of territory not al ready given over to business. As the new site involves the abandonment of the depots that interfere with the comprehensive projects for the embellishment of the cap ital, its Importance risee above the qu~es tion of terminial convenience, and It isto he hoped all parties to the new arrange ment will have no trottble la coming to an agreement.
