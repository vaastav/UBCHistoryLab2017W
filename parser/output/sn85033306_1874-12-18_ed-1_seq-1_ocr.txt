PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE To the Senate ami Howe of Aepnaen'atires : Since the convening of congress one year ago, the nation has undergone a prostration in business and industries such as has not been witnessed with us for many years. Speculation as to the causes for this prostration might be in- uuigea m, witnout protit, because as many theories would be advanced aa there would be independent writers, those who expressed their own views wunout a neanng upon the subject. Without indulziner in theories as to th cause of this prostration, I will only call your attention to the fact, and to one question as to which it would eeem there" 6hould be no disagreement. Dur ing this prostration TWO 

ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS of prosperity have been most abundant labor and capital. Both have been largely unemployed.. "Where, the se curity has been undonbted, capital has Deen attainable at very moderate rates. Where labor has been wanted, it has been found in abundance at cheap rates compared witu what of the necessities and comforts of life should be pur chased with the wages demanded. Two great elements of prosperity, therefore, have not been denied us. A third might be added. Our soil and climate are tmequaled within the limits of any contiguous territory, under one nation ality, for its varieties of products to feed and clothe . a people, and in the amount of surplus to spare to feed less favored people. Therefore, with these facts in view, it seems to me that wise statesmanship at this session of con gress would dictate ignoring the past, and directing in proper channels these great elements of prosperity to . any people. Our debt abroad is the, only element that can, with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any continued depression in the indus tries and prosperity of our people. . . OBIGIN OP GREENBACKS. . A great conflict for national existence made neoessary for temporary purposes is the raising of a large sum of money from whatever source attainable. It may have been necessary in the wisdom of congress, and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premises regarding . the necessity of the times, to devise a sys tem of currency, which it proved to be impossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency of the civilized world. This begat a spirit of specula tion, involving an extravagance and lux ury not required for the happinees or prosperity of a people, and involving both directly and indirectly foreign in debtedness. This currency being of a fluctuating value and, therefore, unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions re quiring money, became a tubject cf speculation in itself. These two causes, however, have in volved us in a foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which should be paid in coin, and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted, gold or its equivalent. The good faith of the government cauriofc be violated toward creditors without ' national dis grace. Our commerce should be en couraged, American f-hipbuilding and carrying increased, and foreign jnarkts sought for the products of the soil and manufactures, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a market can be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil, the mine or the manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our idle capi tal and labor, to the advantage of the whole people. GOLD SEEKS ITS LEVEL. In my judgment the first step " to ward this object is to secure a currency good wherever civilization reipns, one which, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a market with some other ; a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which win give it value. Gold and silver are now the recognized medium of exchange the world over, and to this we should return with the least prac ticable delay. In view of the pledges of the American congress when our present legal tender system was adopted and debt contracted, there Rhould be no delay, certainly no unnecessary de lay, in fixing by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your special attention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent revival of business and in dustries until a policy is adopted, with legislation to carry it out, looking to a return to the specie basis. THE 

DEBTOB CLASS. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it of value to them to make so called money abundant, until they can throw a por tion of their burdens on others. Bat even these, I believe, would b disap pointed in the result, if a course 6hould be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal tender medium of exchange, and delay the revival of pro ductive industries needed by all classes, by none more than by the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate for realization upon its sales. But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be benefitted by expansion, would it be honest to give it ? Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief ? Would it not be as honest and prudent to au thorize each debtor to issue his own legal tenders to the extent of his liabili ties ? Than to do this would it not be safer, for fear of over-issues by unscru- fmlous debtors, to fay that all debt ob i gat ions are obliterated in the United States, and now we commence ant w, each possessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance? DELAY DISHONEST. These propositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by a think ing people. Every delay in the pre paration for final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in degree aa the hpe is held out that a convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commerce. It - will - never come, in my opinion, except by positive action by congress, or by national disasters, which will det-troy for a time at least, the credit of individuals and the state at large, when a sound currency would be reached by total bankruptcy of the redit and integrity of the nation and individuals. I believe it is in the pow er of congress at this session, to devise such legislation as will re store confidence, revive all the indus tries, start ua on the cireer of prosperity, and to save the credit of the nation and the people. Steps toward the return to a specie bal are steps to this end devoutly to be sought fur, and there are others which I may touch on hereafter. " A BONrSTO FOREIGNERS.' A nation dealing in a currency below that of specia in value, labors under two great advantages : First, . Laving no use for the world's acknowledged medium of exchange, gold and silver, these are driven out of the country because there is no demand for their use. Secondly, the medium of exchange being of a 11 a dating valne, for it is only worta just what . it will purchase pi gold ana . silver metals, having an intrinsic value just in proportion to the honest labor ie takes to produce them. a large margin must be allowed for a proht by the manufacturer and produ cer. In the months from the date of production to the date of realization, interest upon capital must be charged. and the risk of fluctation in the value of that which is to be received in pay ment added. Hence high prices act as a protection to the foreign producer, who receives nothinpr in exchange for the product of his skill and labor, except a currency good at a stable value the world over. , THE POOR MAN BEARS THE BRUNT. It Hpems to me that nothing is clearer than that the greater part of the burden of the existing prostration, for the want of a sound financial system, falls upon the workmgman, who must, after all, produce the wealth, and the salaried man who superintends and conducts the business. The burden falls upon them n two ways : By the deprivation of employment, and by the decreased pur chasing power of their salaries. It is the csuty of congress to devise the method of correcting the evils wnich are acknowledged to. exist, and not mine. But X will venture to suggest two or"three things which seem to me aa absolutely necessary to a return to specie payments. - REPEAL OF . THE LEGAL TENDER CLAUSE URGED, The first great requisite in a return to prosperitv is, that the legal tender clause to the law authorizing the issue of currency by the national government. should be repealed, to take effect, as to all contracts entered into aftei a day fixed in the repealing act, not to apply, however, to the payments of salaries by tho government, or other expenses now provided by law to be paid in currency. In the interval and pending between re peal and final resumption, provision should be made by which the secretary of the treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary, from time to time, from the date when specie resump tion commenced. To this might and should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure an accu mulation of gold in the treasury to sus tain redemption. I commend this sub ject to your careful consideration, be lieving that a favorable solution is at tainable, and that if reached by this congress, present and future generations will ever gratefully remember it as their deliverer from a thraldom of toil and disgrace.
