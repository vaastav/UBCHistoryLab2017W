In a disas trous Are which gutted the big four story warehouses of the wholesale grocery firm of. Miner, Read & Tul lock at the corner of State and Water streets before dawn- yesterday morn ing; there was destroyed nearly $150, 000 worth of property. NoO called until one side of the building was a roaring furnace, the firemen, under the direction of Chief Fancher, who had only returned to the. city from a long trip to the west a few hours before the alarm for the fire came in, made a gallant fight against the flames. When first discovered about 4:20 a. m. it was believed that the blaze might spread through the entire block of wholesale, houses in lower State street, but the , firemen managed to save even a portionof the stock and nractically all one side of the build inga new addition which was divid ed from the other part by iron and fire doors. The breaking of a pipe of illumi nating gas caused the partial as phyxiation of Firemen Howards En sign and Charles Burns. , The former was not badly hurt and soon recov- ered when taken out of the building into the open air. Burns became wholly unconscious, however, and had to be carried out of the buildfng. The' blaze in the building was dis coveredabout 4 o'clock in the morn ing by the engineers on some of the switching engines in the "cut." The cause of the fire is a complete mystery. One theory la to the efflt that' the old , cause of mice or rats and matches' was responsible. An other possible cause was a spark from a locomotive in the cut. It i3 not believed possible that the blaze was started by the electric wiring, as the plant has an electric outfit of its own, and this was closed when the factory plant was closed on Saturday. It is believed that the blaze must have Men smouldering in the second floor for about 10 to 12 hours before It broke out into flame and secured the headway it had when discovered. The company has offices in Bridgeport, Meriden and New Britain and the orders of the office here will be filled from those points.

' Washington, Dec. 11 -Full publicity regarding issuance of stocks and bonds -by railroads is the chief recom mendation -of .the railroad securities commission, submitted to Congress, today,' by President Taft, in a special message. "T heartily concur in the recommen dations," writes the President in his - third special message of the session. The commission has been investigat ing issuance of stock by i railroad com panies for more than a year. It de clares, that Federal incorporation of railroads must come but does not rec ommend that it be instituted now. ! Railroad rates are considered only collaterally by the commission. The chief recommendation of the i commission is that all railroads 1 should be forced to report to the In- i terstate . Commerce Commission either prior to or within one year after any securities are issued, complete state ments of their stock and bond liabili ties, issued and unissued, special pre ferences, pledges, receipts and expen dltures, and the value of physical as sets. Fine and imprisonment are urg ed for failure to file these reports. The commission further urges that the Interstate Commerce commission be. given power to make "physical valuations" of railroad property whenever it is necessary.

A disturbance over Lake Michigan extends, this morning to the west gulf coast. It has caused rain dur ing the last 24 hours from the lake region southward over .the central valleys to the gulf. Moderate tem peratures prevail in the districts east of the Mississippi river out an ex tensive area of high pressure over the western states is causing a de creased fall in temperature west of the Mississippi river in the rear of the storm.
