MUN'DAV. l")KCK.Mi:i5l: 10. lor The number of millionaires in I lie United States lias jumped from 14.77 1 to 22,GOG, au increase of 7.'jiTi in one year. Just how far war profiteering has been responsible for this increment to the wealth of the already wealthy is uncertain, but as the war goes 011 and its burdens press more heavily upon the masses, a way will he found to make them disgorge. America went Into this war to crush Ger man military power, and to do so it has found it ueeessary to raise a huge army. If the ac cumplishment of this purpose requires it, this army will be increased to not less than 10.000.0uu trained men. and if Germany does not recognize its strength sooner and sue for peace before the Rhine is crossed, it will plant the Stars and Stripes on every public build ing in Berlin before it conies back home. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are said to have been stolen front the government by three New York corporations, now uuder Federal indictment, for furnishing inferior material in carrying out army contracts. The maximum penalty of two years' imprison ment and a line of ?10.000 is inadequate punishment for this disloyal crime against the people. It is treason in fact, if not in law. and justice should be meted out accord ingly. American engineers maintaining the line of communications behind the British front in the recent yielding up of captured territory by General Byng's forces in front of Cambrai, when caught between the line by the British withdrawal, seized the rifles of slain soldiers and with courage that would have done credit to trained lighters hi the ranks, helped to check the fus-iou* -advance of the enemy. In j anticipation of similar peril in the future 1 under the varying fortunes of battle, engi neer organization: in the American army J hereafter will po to their work armed aud 1 ready to do battle when conditions become j such that ;? gun is more useful than a spade, i llritish and South African troops finally j have cleared German Kant At'rica of the j enemy. This completes the conquest of all ? of the colonies belonging to the German em pirc. amounting in all to more than 1.000.000 \ square miles of colonial possessions, an area ! greater than that of Kurope, exclusive of ; Russia. These captured colonies have a population of about 1 4.000,000 persons, mostly native.-. The question of the return of these colonies t;> Germany will depend very largely on the security Germany is able to put up to repair the damage it has wrought to Belgium. France, Serbia and other coun tries it has overrun during the present war. The decimation of its population may make it willing to part with the colonies as part pay in preference to entailing a huge cash in demnity burden on the people of the German empire prop* r. I That the Buisheviki government in Russia Is nothing more than mob rule is emphasized by the mad action of its supporters in lynch ing General Duklionin, former commander in-chief of the Kussian armies under that authority, because of hi refusal to request German army ollicials to enter into an arm istice. Government b> mobs under the j leadership of German-inspired traitors can not, of course, last long, as inevitably it must | soon topple und< r the weight of its own ex- ' cesses. At fearful cost. Russia in its present i confusol state of mind may submit to such i rule for a time, but soon or late there will be a rally of patriotic intelligence under com petent leadership that will deal mercilessly with the fanatic forces which have seized power, and ultimately e.-tablish responsible government. But every day's delay will add to.the cost of the effort when finally it finds courage to start. Sr.'/ ------- ( The daylight-saving bill will in- before. again at this session, with an earnest plea for Its enactment Into law. it already has pa.i^ed the. Senate by unanimous vote.- Friends of the measure point to twelve Of the most Important Kuropean nations which hate turned the. hands of their clocks forward one hour with great profit to them selves, England alono is said to have saved 800,000 tons of coal in the summer of Ituo, while Frunce saved $10.000,000 in coal uud light. Among the arguments presented lu its behalf are: "Saving in gas, electric light and coal, one more hour, of daylight for farm gardening. recrc#.tlon and health conservation l?v working one hour less in the heat of the summer's afternoon, uniformity with Euro pean countries, and reopening of conuection hot ween our exchanges and those abroad." President Wilson Is. the leading indorser. while thousands of the country's business men and organizations have given their approval to the bill. It is a time lor saving, and if a?v additional hour of daylight will accomplish what it is said to have accomplished else where, it may ho hoped that the House will follow the Senate's example. It is at least worth a trial. 'I'lie Chesapeake und the ar 

MORE than once we have directed atten tion to the fact that the. Chesapeake May with its estuaries had couio into its own since the war began as the great natural base of both military and naval operations of the United States. Almost landlocked ami never icelocked, guarded at its mouth by impassable fortresses, and yet wide enough at its en trance to make a hostile blockade of it al most impossible, this wonderful body of water possesses strategic possibilities superior to any en the Western Hemisphere. This fact has been further reooguized by the government in the new estiiuates re cently submitted to Congress. These esti mates call for an approximate expendituro of $15,000,000 on works of war located in the Chesapeake, in addition to the already enormous sums invested in this section. Tbe greater share of the proposed expenditures is to be applied near the mouth of the bay. For iustanee, $o,500.000 is asked for with which to enlarge the Norfolk Navy-Yard; $2.S00.000 for the development of the naval training station ou Hampton Roads; $1,540. 000 for a deeper channel from Norfolk harbor to the sea; more than $5,000,000 for an ord nance supply depot near C'rauey Island, to say nothing of a number of smaller projects. On top of this, the government is asking for more than $4,000,000 to be expended next year upon operations at the head of the bay. Nearly $2,000,000 of this amount is to be expended upon enlarging and maintaining the gunpowder proving ground, moro than $1,000,000 for the enlargement of the naval proving ground at Indian Head, with almost $1,000,000 for waterway improvements necessary to the military establishment. While no estimate appears in the budget for it. the official announcement has been made that the army is about to locate a second ordnance supply depot at Curtis Bay, Bid., to cost $5,000,000. All these expenditures are for the next fiscal year. They do not include any of the vast amounts of money already authorized at Camp Lee, Camp Meade. Newport News. Jamestown, Norfolk, York ltivcr, Indian Head, Gunpowder Neck, or elsewhere in the Chesapeake Bay region. It is estimated by the government that approximately $35,000, 000 is being expended, or has been expended, j in this section on military or naval works j other than the permanent establishments at [ Fortress Monroe, Norfolk and Cape Henry, i This indicates that by the end of the next ' fiscal year the war expenditures in this sec- i tion will exceed $50,000,000, or considerably I more than provided for any other base in America. A National Budget System WHEN President Wilson recommended to the House of Representatives the adop tion of a hudget system of making appropria tions, he may have gone a step bcyoud nom inal proprieties, but he echoed a very definite demand on the part of the American people. The House may resent "executive interfer ence" in its purely parliamentary processes, as did the Senate when the President ex pressed the hope that a cloture rule would lie adopted by that body. But cloture was put into operation, notwithstanding the senatorial resentment, and we may confidently hope that the llonse will effect the reform urged by the President, whatever may be in dividual feeling with respcct to it. The present House procedure, under which eight or ten separate committees deal with appropriations, necessarily lacks that co ordination which makes for judicious econo my. Every committee is interested in getting just as much money a3 possible for the pro jects in which each may have a special con cern, and there is no curbing power beyond the vote of the whole Hous'! or the Senate. Mr. Wilson's recommendation comes at a peculiarly opportune time. It comes with the announced retirement of Chairman John J. Fitzgerald, of the House Appropriations Committee, from Congress. Mr. Fitzgerald, as head of that powerful committee, exercised exceptional influence upon his associates in holding down appropriations. His with drawal from the House is not only.a loss to that body, but is a loss to the whole country. Even should the House feel disinclined to adopt a budget system as a permanent in stitution. that body might properly put such a plan into effect for the period of the war. Congress has beeu called upon to provide more than $1:5,000.000,000 for the next fiscal year's war operations. The country would feel more confidence in the wisdom of these appropriations if it were known that a single committee composed of the best hralus of the House had fully investigated every plan upon which the administration proposes to make an investment of the people's money. No doubt of the merit of President Wilson's message to Congress can remain when it is praised, almost in toto, by Colonel Roosevelt. However, the Colonel leaves a loophole for possible future criticism by saying that he will discuss the proposals as to Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria at some other date. Ltaron Lowen, Swedish minister, has left Buenos Aires without the formality of making farewell visits. Remembering what hap pened to Von l.uxburg, he evidently wanted to leave while the leaving was good. Threat of jail sentences of one year for slackers should encourage patriotism in the hearts of many youths who otherwise would be deaf to their country's call to the colors. Congress is basing its pians on the assump tion that there will be two more years of war. Whether there be two or twenty, America will be found fighting at the finish. W. J. Bryan predicts a Fpderal prohibition, amendment before J020. It may be recalled that he also predicted the free coinage of silver at 16 to 1. k

At any rate, trained .nurses in many ! hospitals are accepting c.vtra duties , without a murmur. When you consider j that the trained nurse, in time of pcace. I is always an overworked individual, her war activities appear all the more re- j markablc. Junior nurse* have sudden- ; ly had to take over the duties of senior j nurses, while the latter rushed off to i pack their trunks for France. Others ' have hail to become anaesthetists, in ' the place of men who are now in the ! medical col'ps. Still others have work- i cd straight shifts of twenty-four hours. , The government has announced that It does not intend to use the civil hos pitals for military hospitals, unless some unexpected emergency mak?'s ( such a step necessary. Under tho j present plan the majority of our war j hospitals will be In France, since the i return of wounded to this country en- j tails too many hazards. If a man is; only slightly wounded he will be taken j care of in an American base hospital | in France, and as soon as he is recov ered will be sent back to the front. If ! his wound is so serious as to prevent him from being of any further military j use he will be kept In France until he is able to stand the trip home. Only j cases requiring a long period of con- i valeseence are. therefore, apt to be sent ; back to this country. Prepare far I'aexpecterf. Nevertheless, the hospitals are pre- | paring for the unexpected. Some of the larger institutions of "00 or more j beds have offered their services to the , medical department of the army, and j are prepared to receive wounded sol diers at any time. In this event, the | entire hospital. If necessary, or that ' section of it devoted to the wounded, j would automatically pans under mili tary control. in the meantime, however. seriou3 problems must be faced. Many hos pitals supported by private subscrip tions are having a hard time gettlnn along for the reason that the subscrib ers are showing a tendency to with- ' draw their usual contributions and put | them into the more spectacular actlvl- ) ties of the war. The high cost of food : reacts upon hospitals the same as upon other consumers. Moreover, linen, cot ton. steel instruments, acids, drugs? j all the articles that go to make up the , equipment of the hospital?arc not only ; expensive, but hard to get. European order are given prcceaence by the ! manufacturers, and home orders arc slow in delivery owing to trafU* con- - gestloti. The medical department of the army, it la true, has been os considerate as passible. In accepting physicians In j the medical corps the surgeon-general ' and his assistants have made every ef- j fort to work as little hardship as pos hible on the hospitals of the country, j They have exempted men who were ? especially necessary to certain hospital staffs., as well a3 teachers in medical schools. The importance of keeping up the na tion's medical schools in spite of the war has been realized by the govern- j Information Bureau. l??julriei? regarding ?lm?M any topic, excepting ao legal anil medical tub jectn, are aaavrrred free.
