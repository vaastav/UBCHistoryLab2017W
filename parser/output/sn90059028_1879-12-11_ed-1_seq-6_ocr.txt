AN alarming sickness has broken out among the convicts of the Kentucky penitentiary, and'from four hundred to five hundred men are unable to work. THE total value of exports of domes tic provisions and tallow from the prin cipal ports of this country for October, 1879, was $7,886,627, and for the same month in 1878, $6,797,065. WHEN the ex-Empress Eugenie ar rived at Madrid, her mother, the count ess de Montijo, was already dead. The ex-empress visited her mother's house on Saturday, and prayed over her body. AT a meeting of Manchester Fenians a resolution was passed declaring that though a number of the brethren had seceded under ecclesiastic ban, there is life enough left in the society to carry out the redemption of Ireland. A YEAR and a half ago a mission for lepers was established in North Iudia by a missionary of the Church of Scotland. Jt has now three asylums, with eighty inmates, and of these twelve have pro fessed Christianity. A more unattract ive missionary field cannot well be found. ANOTHER of those too common ac cidents" with a loaded gun has happen ed in Portland, Oregon. A yonnst fool was cleaning a gun, and pointed it at two women to frighten them. He did not know it was loaded the gun was discharged, and one of the women was instantly killed. A fat boy living near Knowlesville, Orleans county N. Y. kicks the beam at 199 pounds, although only 11 years of age. The fat seems to accumulate about his legs, which have grown to suchji size as to prevent him from walking to school. THE old powder magazine built by the union forces, which stood on Main street in the edge of the old cemetery at Richmond, Va., has been torn down. This is the last of the works left from the war. The fortifications which were around the grounds now occupied by the magnificent buildings of Central university, have long since disappeared. M. VALENTINE, senator of France, died suddenly in Paris lately, aged 56. Ex iled by Louis Napoleon in 1851, he be came professor of military history at the military academy royal, Woolwich, England, but in September, 1870, was appointed professor of Strasburg, then besieged by Germany, and entered it by swimming across the river at night under fire. At the surrender he was imprisoned at Ehrenbreitstein. THREE whales appeared off Cape May, N. J., one day last week, close in shore, going eastward slowly, throwing single spouts about twenty feet into the air. They were probably of the sperm species. Large flocks of sea gulls sur rounded and dived about. them. They stopped the gillnet fishermen who were after snapping mackerel, and kept pos session of the sea during the day. CHILDREN in England are very apt to pick and swallow the berries of the yew. The practice is a dangrou? one, as is shown by the case 6f a little boy on whose body an inquest has been held at Oxford. The child had been strolling through a cemetery with his friends, and, while playing about, he had pluck ed and eaten "a handful of yew-berries." No evil efl'ect was noticable until next morning, when he awoke in convulsions and died even before the doctor could be fetched. The poison seems to have attacked the nerve centres, but in what specific manner could not be said. THERE is a prospect that the Kilken ny policy will be adopted by the Utes. Five hundred Southern Utes are ex pected at the Los Pinos agency, to re inforce Ouray, who has expressed his determination to arrest the White River Utes who led in the Meeker massacre. The white River Utes have been col lecting .their forces, and are not likely to allow the arrests to be made if they can help it. They number about throe hundred warriors, while the combined strength of the Southern and the Un compahgre Utes is about seven' hun dred, and Ouray claims positively that these two bands will stand by him even to the extent of fighting the White River Utes, who are' only naturalized member of the tribe. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow Citizens of Ihe Senate and House of Rep resentatives CONGRATULATORY. The members of the Forty-sixth Congress havo assembled in their first regular session under air camstances calling for mutual congratulation and grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of alt good for the large and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occnrr cd in our public aft'airs since my last annual mes sage to congress are connected with the financial operations of the government dircctlv affecting the business interests of the country. I congratu late congress on the successful execution of the resumption act. At the time fixed and in the manner contemplated by law, United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the first ot January last they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all business transactions, public and private, in all parts of the couatrv, they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the treasury for gold And silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary de- Eas osit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes been very large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes re deemed is about $40,000,000. 

RESUMPTION. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing foreign de mand for our manufactures and agricultural pro ducts has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last, to November 15, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and grati fying improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the government bearing only four per cent. interest have been sold at or above par, suf ficient in amount to pay off all of the national debt \yhich was redeemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt, since March 1,1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which matures within less than two years is $792, 121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of five per cent., and the balance is in bonds Dealing six per cent, interest. It is believed thai this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of four per ccnt. bonds, and, by the reduc tion ot interest which will thus be effected, about eleven millions ot dollars can be annually saved to the treasury. To secure this important reduc tion of interest to be paid by the United States, further legislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be provided by congicss during its present session. 

COINAGE. The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States, during the last fiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars, since the passage of the act for that purpose, up to November 1,1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been is sued from the treasury ana are now in circulation and $32,300,506 arc still in the possession of tho government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of ac tion between the United Siates and the principal commercial nations of Europe, to effect a perma nent system for the equality of gold and silver ir. the recognized money of the world, leadB me to recommend that congress rel'rain from new legis lation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during the coming year, its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further experi mental measures with the coinage. I would however, strongly urge upon congress the import ance of authorizing the secretary of the treasury to euspend tbe coinage ot silver dollars upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the sil ver dollar being uniformly and largely less thar the market value of the gold dollar, it is obvious ly impracticable to maintain them at par wi'h each other if both are coined without limit. II the cheaper coin Is forced Into circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired objec\ which is a currency Of both gold and sil ver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. RETIREMENT cr GREENBACKS. The retirement, from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal-tender in private contracts, is a step to lie taken in our pro gress towards a tafe and stable currency, whicii should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government, and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue ol legal-tender paper money based wholly upon the. authority and crsclit of the government," except ia extreme emergency, is without, wan ant in the constitution, and a violation of sound lloanciit! principles. The Issue of United States notes dur ing the late civil war with the capacity of It gal tender between private individuals was not au thorized except as a meant of rescuing th» country from imminent peril. The circulation ol these notes as paper money, for any protracted period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose, was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They an ticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period consis tent with the attainment of tii* object for which they were provided. FATING THE WAR D1SBT. The policy of the United States, "steadily ad hered to from the adoption of tne constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and when, from necessity in time of war. debts hare been crentsd, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly na possible. With this view, and for this pnrpose, it is recommended that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sink ing fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be maintained. It any change of the objects or rates ot taxation i« deemed necessary by congress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars an nually to the treasury. POLYGAMY.. The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and inttuentiftl citizens of the territory or Utah of the laws of the United States for the prosecution and punishment o? polygamy demands the attention of every depart ment of the government. This territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a -state, and the general interest of the nation, as •well as the welfare of the citizens of the terri tory, require its advance from tbe territorial foim of government to the responsibilities and priv ileges of a state. ThH important change will not, however, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah in very considerable number uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime iy the laws of all civilized communities through, out the world. The law for the suppression of this offence Was enacted with great unanimity by congress more than seventeen years ago, but hiis remained until recently a dead letter in the territory of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of Utah that tho law was in contravention of the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. This objection is now remov ed. The supreme court of the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative power of congress, and binding as a rule of action for all who reside within the territories. There la no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in Its enforcement. It should be firmly and effect ively executed. Ir not sufficiently stringent In lie provisions it should be amended, and. In aid ol the purpose in view, I recommend that more comprehensive and more searching method* for preventing as well as punishing: this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the territories of the United states may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enforcement ot the law on this subject. ZLXCT1VS FRANCHISE. The elections of the past year, though occupied only with state offices, have not failed to elicit in the political discossions which attended them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take In the progress of the country towardo a more general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and lreedom In the exercise or the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in the sphere of national and state authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed In my last annual menage, that no temporary or' administrative in terests of government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of oar people in de­ fence of the primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional and state attachments,' in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry witlf them unchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelli gence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions ou other political subjects, to untte in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon congress to supply any defects in these laws which eixperience has shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation of the executive and legislative authorities of the states in this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights, no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the country, or retard the general diffusion of prosperity. 

CIVIL SEBVIOB. In a former message I invited the attention of congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the government, and expressed the intention of transmitting to congress as early as practicable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the civil service commission. In view of the fact* that, during a considerable period, the government ot Great Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses, in various particulars analogous to those presented in this country, and that in recent years the measures adopted were understood to have been effective and in every respect highly satisfactory, I thought it desirable to have fuller inlormation upon the subject, and accordingly re quested the chairman of the civil service com mission to make a thorough investigation for this pprpoae. The result has been an elaborate and comprehensive report. The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage, and of official interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under tue superintendence of a single commis sion, have, with great advantage, been establish ed as conditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The comple tion of the repoit, owing to the extent of the labor involved in its preparation, and tho omission of congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the expense of the commission, has been postponed until the present time. It is herewith transmitted to congress. While tbe reform measures on smother govern ment are of no authority for us, tney are entitled to influence, to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and social life may commend them to our consid eration. The views I have heretofore ftpremed concern ing the defects and abuses in our civil administra tion remain unchanged, except ia bo far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of tbe people them selves to co-operate for their removal. Tbe grave evils and perils ofa'.partisan-spoils system of ap pointment to office and of oQlco tenure, are now generally recognized. In tbe resolutions of the great parties, in the reports of departments, in the debates and proceedings of congress, in tbe mes sages of executives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform has been'admitted. To command the necessary support, every meas ure of reform must be based on common right and justice,* and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential to a great and free state. When tbe people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence! on the part of tbe officers they have selected, and of the advisers who, in accordance with our political institutions, should be consulted, in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, is :ndeepensihle. It is eminently proper that they should explain it be fore the people, asl well as illustrate its splr* in the performance of tMeTr official duties. Very different consideration" apply to the Creutcr number of those wii II the subordinate places iu the civil service. .en- responsibility is to their superiors in f. i»l position. It is their duty to obey tbe It's -unctions of those upon whom that author kv involved, and their best public service con^i the discharge of their functrons irrespeci.. of partisan politics, their duties are the sam '.never party is iu power an.l whatever po -vails. As a con sequence it follows that toir tenure of office should not depend on' prevalence of any" toIiry or tbe supremacy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully, quite irrespective of parti­ san interests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure, should also prevail in the appointment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. The authority of appoint ment and lemoval is not a perquisite, which may be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be exercised iu the public interest, under all the sanction* which attend the obliga tion to apply the public funds only for public purposes. livery citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering the public service oi his country. The only just ground of discrimination, is the measure of character and capacity he has to make that service most useful to the people. Except In cases where, npou just and recognized principles, as upon the theory of pensions, offices and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past services, their bestowal upon any tbeory which disregards personal merit, if an act of injustice to the citizens, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power is held. In the light of these principles, it becomes of great importance to provide just and adequate means, especially for every department, and large administrative office, where personal discrimina tion on the part of its head is not practicable, for ascertaining those qualifications to which ap pointments and removals should have reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts npon which the most righteous claim to office depends, but, of necessity, to discourage all worthy aspi rants, by handing over appointments and remov als. to mere influence ana favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the ap pointment, and the interest of the people to be stow it upou him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertaining personal fitness for office must be an important and permanent function of every just and wise government. It haslong since become impossible, in the great of fices, for those having the duty of nomination and appointment, to personally examine into tbe in dividual qualifications of more than a small pro portion of those seeking office and, with the en largement of the civil service, that proportion must continue to become less. In the earlier years of the government, the sub» ordinate offices were so few In number that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates. Party managers and methods had not then become powerful agencies -of coercion, •hostile to the free and just exercise of the ap pointing power. .' A large and responsible part of the duty of res toring the civil service to tho desired purity and efficicncy rests with the president, ana it is my purpose to do what is within my power to ad vance snch prudent and gradual measures of re form as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority, it is in the power of the executive to do much to promote sucli a reform. But it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operation on the part of congress and considerate and intelligent support among tho people. Reforms which chal lenge the generally accepted theories of parties, and demand changes in tho methods of depart ments. arc not the work of a day. Their perma nent foundations must be laid in sound principles and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversar cs. Every worthy officcr desires to make his of ficial action again and honor to his country, but the people themselves, far more than their officers in public station, are Interested in a pure, econom ical, and vigorous administration. By laws euacted In 1853 and 1855. and now in sub stance Incorporated in the Revised Statutes, tne practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades In tbe great departments was condemned, and examinations, as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of examin ers, were provided for and made conditions of ad mission to the public service. Tbese statutes aro a decision by Congress thai examination of some sort, as to attainments and capacity, are essential to the well-being of the public service. Tne tin- faws ortant questions since the enactment of these have beea as to the character of these exam inations, and whether official favor and partisan Influence, or common right and merit, were to con trol the access to the examinations. In practice, these examinations have not always been open to worthy persona generally who might wish to be examined. official favoritism and partisan influ ence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alene were permitted to go before the exam-. lntng-board8, subjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends ef the candidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence, the standard of admission fell belsw that-Whlcb the public In- interest demanded. It was also almost inevitable that a»eystem which provided for various separate boards of examiners.with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to the public interests. A further and more radical change wasobviou-iy required. In the annual message ot December, 1870, my predecessor declared time "there is no duly which .«o much embarrasses the executive and heads of departments as that of appointments: nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed ou senators and representatives as that of finding .places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and orcen not even fit men for the public places. The elevation and purifica tion of the civil service ot the government will be li'iiled with approval bv the whole people of the United States," Congress accordingly passed the act, approved March 3,1871, ''to cgulate the civil service of the United States and promote the effi ciency thereof," giving tbe neces-.arv authority to the executive to inaugurate a civil-service re form Acting under this statute, which w:s Interpreted as intended to secure a system of just »nd effectual examinations under uniform supervision, a num ber of eminently competent persons wei-e selected for the purpose, who entered with zeal upou the discharge of their duties, prepared, with an intel­ ligent aopreclation of the requirements of tho ser vice, the regulations contemplated, and took cbargc of the examinations, and who, in tlirir ca pacity as a board, have been kuown as the ''Civil •aervice Oommifsion. Congress for two years ap propriated the money needed for the compensa tion ana for the expense of carrying on the work of the commission. It appears from the report of the commission, submitted to the president in April, 1871, that ex aminations had been held in varions sections ot ,Si .untrY\ ,aMd ,thi^t an appropriation of about *2S.00U would be required to meet the annual ex penses, including salaries, involved in discharging the duties of tne commission. The report was tS,.8??Pre??,.by special messago ot April 18, lb if. with the following favorable com ment upon the labors of the commission: "If sus tained by congress, I have no doubt the rules can. after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the public service and relieve the executive, members of congress, and the heads of departments, from Influences prejudicial to good administration. The -rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, listve resulted beneficially, as is shown by tho opinions of the members of the cabinet and their subordi nates in the departments, and in that opinion I concur." And in the annual message of December of the same year similar views are expressed, aud an appropriation for continuing the work of the commission again advised. The appropriation was not made, and, as a conse quence, the active work of the commission was suspended, leaving the commission itself still in existence. Without the means, therefore, of cans lug qualifications to be tested in any systematic manner, or of securing for tbe public service the advantages of_ competition upon any extensive ?iss. "I in J" ituuaai 'message oi December. 1877, tho making of an apprprlatfou for the resumption ef the work oX tne commis sion. 1 In the meantime, however, competitive exam inations under many embarrassments have been conducted within limited spheres in the execu tive departments in Washington, and in a num ber of the custom houses and post offices of the [principal cities of the country, with a view to further test their effects, and, In every instance, they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under tho administration of my predecessor. I think the economy, purity and cfficienty of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic Introduc tion. wherever practicable, throughout the entire 'civil servico of the government, together with ample provision for their general supervision, In order to secure consistency and uniform justice, Reports from the secretary of the interior, from the postmaster-general, from tbe^postmaster in the city of New York, where such examinations 'have been some time on trial, and al«o from tbe collector of the port, the naval officer, and the surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has, in various ways, contributed to Improve tbe public service. The reports show that the results have been sal utary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rales cannot fail to be of decided benefit to the service. The reports ot the government officers, in the city of New York especially, bear decided testi mony to the utility of open competitive examina tions in their respective offices, showing that these examinations, and the excellent qualifica tions of those admitted to the service through them, havo bad a marked Incidental effect upon (the persons previously in the service, and partic ularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There baa. been, on the part ot these latter, an Increased Interest in the work, and a desire to extend ac quaintance with it beyond tbe particular desk oc cupied, and,thus the morale of tbe entire force has been raised. The examinations have jbeen attended by many citizens who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests and the method of de termining the results, and those visitors have, without exception, approved the methods em plowed, and several of them have publicly attest ed their favorable opinion.*' Upon such considerations, I deem it my duty to renew the recommendation contained in my aa liual message of Xiectimber, 1877, requesting con gress to make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the work of tbe civil servlee commission. Economy/will be promoted by au thorizing a moderate compensation to persons in the public service who may perform extra labor 'upon or under the commission, as the exe cutlve may direct. I am convinced that if a joet and adequate test of merit is enforced tor-admission to the pub lie service and in making promotions, such Abuses as removals withont good cause and par tisan and official interference with the proper exercise of thoappointing power, will in' large measure disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointments, and ,the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbingTand mischievous political activity, on tho part of those thus ap pointed, which not only interferes with tbe due discharge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom, of elections.' Not without warrant, in the views of several of my predeces fors in the presidential office, andLdirectly with in the law of 1871, already cited. I endeavored, by regulation, made on the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limit to such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never perhaps' be necessary, to define with precision the proper limit of political action on tbe part of federal: officers. Bat while their right to hold and freely1 express their opinions cannot be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use tho authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, or to coerco tbe political action of those who hold different opinions. Seasons of justice *nd public policy, qulto analogous to those which forblcUhe use of ot* Octal power for the oppression of the private citizen, impose npon the government tho duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbi trary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making leviesKfor party purposes, I upon the salaries of omcers'is highly demoraliz*1 ingto the public service and discreditable to tho country. Though an officer should be as free as any other eitizen, give his money In aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as! any otber citizen to refuso to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for tbe time ami labor of the officer, it is a gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made exces sive in order that they may bear tho tax, tbe ex ce is an Indirect robbery -of the public funds. I recommend, therefore, euoii a revision and extension of present st»tpt$s as Isbatl secure to I those in every grade of official-life .or public em ployment the protection with,w&loa a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faltoful in its service.
