OTTAWA FKtE TRADER: SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1871. Bilahra gut grabcr. Ottawa III.. SatNdar, Deronbwr 9 1891. Tbo Message. The Message ol Prcskltni Grant, read in Congress on Monday, is given on our second page. The docni"-- tiossesscs, at least, the merit of brevity. The Ytsideat gives us a hasty, humdrum review t our foreign and domestic affairs, makes r .cw ad eaptandmn re commendations to wL.Ji coDgresa is not ex pected to pay any attention, indulges in a few platitudes, and tlieu dismisses the matter as another disagreeable formality got along with with the least pos&ihlo trouble. The ouly point on which the President appears to gut out of the old rut in wlndi he and his party have been traveling since the inauguration of the reign of radicalism und iiialiguity iit 1SG0, is that where he recoil r) ends the granting ot general uiuncMy to the Southern people ; but Trh:'.tever glimmering of hutn&uity and com mon sense there maybe in the rccomiiicnla tion, is at once dissipated by another recom mendation, that the odious kuklux bill be con tinued in force. This is equal to a proposal to release the prisoners from a penitentiary that they may be put upon the rack or drawn and quartered. The message is, in brief, cha racteristic of Grant throughout, and that can only mean that it is a fearful descent from the annual presidential rtsume the country was wont to receive in the better days of the Re public. The News. Congress met on Monday, a quorum being present in botli houses, Besides reading and referring the President's Message, very little business was done. Speaker Blaine announ ced the standing committees ofthe house, "wLich are chiefly notnbla for the manner in which the west is slighted. The senate, as Usual, elected its committees. An effort to re Store Sumner to the head of the Foreigu Af .fairs committee, being opposed by Grant, fail ed ignobly, and the position was given to the -firtuous Cameron, who manifested his fitness for it a year ago by expressing his opposition ito allowiug the Alabama claims, saying they were no more just than the Georgia, Florida, or tho claims of any other rebel state ! Shurz, 'the ablest man iu the senate, is not placed .at the bead of a single committee. Senator Trumbull denounces as false the statement of an "interviewer," that he was in favor of the re-election of Grant. The Illinois legislature has had a quorum iu 'both houses since Monday, and has been hard ;at work. No mcaanre of importance, howev -er, has yet been passed. P. A. Warden, chief of the division of ac counts in the treasury department, turns up a .thief to the contemptible amount of 112,000. A yesterday's Washington despatch to the New York Time any Secretary Fish's resig nation was on Thursday placed in tho hands Of the President. Spinner, the grciit anttigr.ipliist, wli so ac counts as assistant tivsurcr have for some time past looked suspicious, is ascertained to :bc short only" $0U,iOi The news from England relates chiefly to the ".startling" progress of republican ideas. A bolition of the house of 1 rds and an elective lavuifirriiy, are the leading ideas insisted up on. The Prince of Wales is reported to have Jidda- rslapse and to be in an alarming condi tion, nnl great excitement in business and fi nanc'iiu circles prevails iu consequence. The Chicn':) Ti.it:--; appeared yesterday mor ning in its old eight page form, somewhat en larged, and beautifully printed on new typa throughout. The facts presented by Mayor Mud ill to the City Council of Chicago, in bis recent mes sage, as to tho power of t lie Council to assess special tuxes for the improvement of streets and Hide'.valks, place the gabble of the Ottawa lujotlllrun about the responsibility :i:i,l ci'iiiu crdity rf our city ainhiinMw in rcgu-'. to city improvements in its true light. The Su preme Coin t of the Slste," says M.iyor Mjdill, "eiuec its re-organization under tin: new con stitution, 1ms made decisions overruling all its lo;-mcr decisions, which, carried to their ulf incite sequence, work a perfect revolution in tl.c cystein of special assessments, and in deed overthrow them totally. The corpora tioh counsel gives it an his opinion that these lute decisions of the supreme ourt have so un seUlcl the law of assessments fts to render it lini 'vsible for the city to continue its Improve iiu ,.'..-under the present charter, unless it is desired that th-j cost licri.-ufter of all street op-cu.u.-., widening, or uiipioveiuer.ts mid bidc w.ilk building, hhisil be paid by general taxa tion. Tim court has so construed the law thai there can be no pn.ibl,. Wuy of making a special iis'ssment to pMy the cost of i.n im pn.wnenr, that may nr be defeated by any inti n:;'.l party wh.i may resist payment." Our riiy iiutli.iritii-s knew what 'the decision cftlr: :ir;u'eme cuat t i;iut b under the law and ' lin ! tgo i!i!oth;p,.,-.i d WW n l-iivm - ; ;i litis due to tk-ir intelligence 11; .. o. r t.l:y not to-day in the same im,i:i., i as Chic i- -encuml'cred by an lmmciiM-ilrht, ii.eie iM: I lit!gati!v;lli' ipiestion. It. isb.ire ly ,. j-.-iblo th.d the city cinuicil of Chicago, in Uiid.ilnlvi'it, the (-xteii-ive irilringejneiit of private rlghta Jwhich this special assessment buMiK. s involve?, being brainless themselves, were nd vised by dough-heads like those who . gabble at our city authorities through the Ot. tava A';"W'a1 ; or pel haps like tl:v editors Of that hli'jct, th- y l.'( i..ng to tli.'"!,i;',liei lae." .ltd suasion. Signs of Shame. We are gratified to be able to aty at least tbis much in favor of the editor of the Ottawa Republican, that be shows tdgn f being shamed of himself. The feeling, in his case, to hare anj merit, should be easy and natural, Lot the painfully labored column which he is compelled to indite to eke out an apology which could have leen said in three lines, shows that even so lamentable an effort to do manly thing, went eorelv against the grain. The case was thU : There was a gentleman of irreproachable character, whom almost every soul in this community knows and esteems whom even William Cullen professes to hold iu the highest estimation, and whom he cor dially greets on the street as a friend, smiling and nuirking in his face while he stabs him in the back ; and this gentleman, who is in no public position no candidate for anything a mere private citizen minding his own busi ness, William Cullen brutally assails; and when taxed with the meaDness of the act, he admits it, bet makes this excuse : ' lie is the personal and political friend of the editor of the Fiiee Tuarcr, and the editor of the Frf.e Thadrr says awful hard things about the re venue thieves in our party, and he belongs to a church, and lies in his paper, and he is a scamp generally, but socially a clever fellow, and I think his brain is softening,' Jcc., Ac. That is William Cullen' apology for a cow ardly and unmanly act! It would take the lowest kind of a sneak thief to make a mean er one. As to the puerile attempt of tbo lityuLhcan to say something funny at our personal ex pense, his jokes might provoke a smile were they not so shockingly butchered in fact converted into nauseating dishwater, in their transfer from the La &?,lte Pies. We re commend, decidedly, that hereafter, when the UepuUkan steals the wit (!) of the 7V.y, it do so bodily. As to the "softening of the brain" business, we take pleasure in guaranteeing William Callen forever against any sueli ca lamity. There can be no "softening of brains" where there are no brains. The Dixon Herald, a radical paper advo cating au renewed lease of power for its party, among other things claima for it "An econ omical administration and gradual reduction of the public debt." That's sarcastic. The republican administration of which that pa per speaks, last year collected from the peo ple, mainly from the poor ut that, and not from tho rich, Four hundred million of dollar, and out of this enormous sum, less than nen hundred millions have gone towards the pay ment of the public debt. The remaining three hundred millions were distributed among assessors, collectors, guagers, post masters itinerant spies and detectives, who spied and detected nothing that did not yield them a handsome revenue ; to carpet bag con gressmen, members of southern legislat ures, radical scalawags and thieves, and all really to hold the radical party together and secure Grunt's reflection. These are facts which tax payers bhouid consider and ponder well. OuiTUAKT. It is with more than ordinary feeling of regret that we are called apon to re oord the death of Joel W. Armntrotifr, of Doer Turk. He died at his home on Saturday, Dec, 21, at 3 P. M., of typhoid fever, after im illness of about eix weeks, agod 5-1 years, 10 months and 2(i days. His remains were buried on Mon day last, at the church yard, near hi lae resi dence, where also lies tho body of bin lamented sen MulforJ. Sir. Armstrong was among the pioneer Hettlers of this oounty, haviuir come to Illinois with his mothur, Elsio .Armstrong, who litcly died at Morris, in 1831, and bus ever since resided in thin county. From timo to time he has bocu entrusted with diffruht local offices, both of honor itnd responsibility, and in no esse hs liu Ween otherwise tbttn a faithful public, ser vant. He was a prominent, patriotic und valu nolo citizen, and tho entire community regret his death mid tympathizn with tho fuiuily in thoir bere&vetnout. A Good Akhasokment.

BOMB MATTERS Pepper Salt and Spire. Fussing a saloon door, oas evening lately (It nuy Ncm incredible, bat we do mantgs to get by one occasionally, without going in) we saw a pretty kitten shivering on the snowy aad ley sije-walk. We picked the poor littU thing op and carried it home. Within two hoars altar wards that cat died it delirium tremtnt 1 Oar enewirs insist that that eat caught tha disease from inhaling our ("BeemusV) breath, bat we think it contracted imiaa a potu in the usual way; tie from constantly frequenting saloons..... Jim Mclnhill an a retriever of drawing things, is an improvement upon a Newfoundland dog. One day lately, Jim mv "a cow with a arum plod born," in the side-cut "all ferlorne," and she was fast slipping uuder the ice. Seeing a tow line near, Jim. cut it with his "little hatchet" and hastily forming a "slip-noose," thtew it over the cow horns and with the help ot some other perilous soon hauled the bainte ou shore. Jim tl.iius no reward, as he believe "virtue it Us own ruwird." On the following day, at the same pl tue, Jim heard a crv of distress, but this time it was not from u cow, but a man an eld gentle maa who was wheeling a hand cart. Jin ran to the scene of action and procuring a rope, slang one end of it to the mau in the water, who was holding on th edgo of th io. The old gent seized the rope, and was rapidly beiasr pulled out. Finding that he was about to ha -ved ho ehouted, "Hold on boy till I gt my cart'" A gentleman from Erin, looking on, be came so disgusted at this that he exolaimej "By, shlide tho owld miser baek aad let am rot wid his cart." Us equaled SfcCEss. There seensi to be no limit to the amount of business dene, cr that ean be done at Reddick and Gillen's. Their dai ly sales foot up la good round sums. In fact, they show monthly balance sheets and quantities of goods handled that would do credit to metro politan wholsale houses. This firm are doing a large jobbing business with merohants aronad ns, in the smaller towns. They osn hold this trade because they buy goods from first hands, and in large quantities and at a discount be cause they pay cash. Mr. Gillen's excellent judgment and extensive experieaee as a buyer guarantee that, no inferior goods ean aver be found in this establishment, and this is also a positive advantage to the inexperienced or the amall buyer, as it saves a jonrney to the manufacturers r tbo importer's warehouse, and even when there could not buy so cheaply ss from Reddick & Gillen here, aad besides, would never be deceived as they warrant everything they sell. While the wholesale trade of this firm is quite an item, their retail business is enormous. This comes from the reasons we have enumerated, and from the fact that their stock is always full in every department, and ladies are always sure that whatever artiele they may find at Reddick & Gillen's is in style sbd new ar.d a'ood, a well s boing elegant and worth wht is asked. Remablb Insurance. It wis only a few days befor tho great firo that the President of one of the heaviest of the English insurance companies (tlie Imperial, of London,) was in Chicago with a viow t establishing an agency here, but was so iitiprtsed with the precarious ncss of our situation thit bo declined to yield to the temptation of hih premiums and establish an au'oney here. "I comot do It," said he : "you have seme fine building's, bat you hav them surrounded by very bad ones. Tho firt tinio circumstances combino ngaiurit you, your whole city will burn up." This experienepd under writer had hirdty ticao t tret ont of tho country beforo his predictio-j wis territdy verified. CldciHjo Tribune.
