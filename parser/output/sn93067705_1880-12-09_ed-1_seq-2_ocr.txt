Qtdnuties are putzzle Jog themselvev as to wliat course legislation and debates wil take. The Weiuformed correspondent, of tho New York lerald reports that the Democrats are good-natured, and the Republicans colsious that they madO avery narrow escape. So that both sides talk conidently of a quiet busi aess session. The Ropublicans expect to pin the Democrats to the tarifr and anternpl improvement Issues., hoping thereby to gain accessions front South 'ern subsidy advocates aid Nortlieru manutcturers. While the prevalling Impression favors a quiet session, a hesed controversy may arise any time between Stalwarts and Bourbons, if the President's recommendations about Southern legislationl are follow ed out, a heated debate will inevitably result, and Northern frauds and bull dozing will be fully shown up. Mr. Garfield has very studiously avoided indicating who his cablaict ap. polutnents wiJ be. Several Senators are said to have been offered port folios, but they most respectflly do. eline. A cabinet omco Is not a bed of roses. Much work Is required, and every year a swarm of disappointed offc-seekers buzzes about hisi ears inl a manner most Irritating. Neverthe. less when the time comes any number patriot@ will be ready and anxious to aecept any erumbs that may fall from the Prosidential table. rZN t2PAZb&NEw MaggA G. The Coemsitutaaa Amendanent--ooag for she Morfions--CyIVi Servioe Resena and OtherMAttrs. Pidaont Hayes' tnssage was read on Monday. It is the longest docu ment he has yet penned. Opening with congratulations on the general prosperity of the country and the peacefti electiols, lie touches upon the amendments as follows: Continued opposition to the fAil and fiee enjoyment of the rights of citizel ship. cofliired upon the colored ie'o ple by the recent mnicltdml'ents to the Constitutioll, still pievahlb in cveral of the late slNveloldinig Staite. It ha$, perhaps, not beeii lminifested in the rocent election to any large extent In acts of violece or iltimi1ida1tion. It has, however, by framilulelnt. practices in contontioll wit the ballots, witl the regulations as to the places alid manner of voting, and wit h counting, returiig and canvantintg the votes, cast, been suCCsrtutl 1U QUA1a1an1ug 01C exercise of thle right preervative of all -rights--the tight of' sufreage-which the Constitution expressly conlfira npon - our enanc~aahised citizens. It is the deosire of the goiod people of the whole country tat sectioalistuan as a factor Int our polities shouthl distap. pear. Th'ley prefer that no0 secton or tho coutryt1~ P1hould( be uitited in slid opposition to anty ot her sectuion. Thet isposition to refuse at prompllt tad hearty obedience to the equal r'ighlts amlendmenits to the Conastittinll is aill that n1ow. stanids. hl the waiy of a cm plete obliterat Itn of' seetiut'nal lines ill our political (conte'sts. As lig Ias either of' ths ninenIdmenlts is thuigrant Jy violated or' disre'gardedl, it is sle to assume that the people whlo placed them inl the Constitutionl, as5 ensbody lng thte legitimaat~e results of the war for the Unlona, and who believe themi to be wise and nieesary, will coin thnme to act togetheri, and1( to insist that they shalli bo obeyed. Th'le paramontH~tl questoon still is, as8 to the entiormnt, of the right by every A mitil citizen, who has the reivi'ite qulttiiifition,ato treely cast his v'ote mui( tO have it hionestly cotuntetd. Wtithi this quetstiont rightly settled, the coiutry will be relieved of' the contenltionsof' thei paist; bygones will indeed be bygoites; andpoliil at par'ty issuesM with respect to economty andit efieienlcy of' adinistrat iont,ite (rnal impreoemntts, the tariff, diomuestie taxation, ediuca tiotn, hltnance, and other imlpor'tantt subh sects. will then~ r'eeive their full shlare of ttention ; but resistanetna to anti nlliftitioni of the results of the war, will untite together inl resolute piur pose for theleh sutppor't all who mtait talln the authority of the Governiment and the peOrpetuilty of the Untion, anld who adequately appreciate the value of thte victory achieved. This determni nation proceeds froma no hostile senti mntt or feelintg to any part or the peO ple of our Country, or to any~ of' their Inte ret. The inviolability of the amtendments rests upont the iuhnda mental prInciple of our Government. They are the solemn expression of. the will of the people of' the United States. The sentiment that the constitution al rights of all oir citizens mutlst be mainltained, does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the t(overn nmnt of the eounttry. Ilappily, the history of the late election show's that in many parts of the country, where opposition to the fifteenth amendment has hitherto prevailed, It is diminish ling, and Is likely to cease altogether, if a firm and well-considered actloll is taken by Congress. I trust the House of Rtepasntatives atnd the Senate, whtehbave the right to jut of the eteotions, returns and qusa tis of their own mnembers, will see to it that every case of violation of tile letter' or spirit of the Afteentht amendmentt iin thoroughly investigated, antd that no0 benefit firom such violationm shallauoruo to any person or party.
