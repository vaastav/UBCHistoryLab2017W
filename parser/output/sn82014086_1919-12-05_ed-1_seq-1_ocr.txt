In questioning the advisability of the action suggested in the Furl reso lutlon. .Mr. Lansing was quoted as saying that the Jenkins correspond ence seemed about to bring a real test whether Carranza meant to heed the warning given some months ago, and that it might be wiser to let this question be answered before breaking off relations. Such a break, he is said also to have suggested, might not only endanger Ihe effort, to obtain Jenkins' release, hut also place other American lives and interests in jeopardy by the withdrawal of diplomatic repres'enta t ives.

He has been one of the bitterest oppo nents of the administration for its past attitude toward Mexico, though his resolution endorses the stand taken in the Jenkins case. A recent charge by Senator Fall that the MetCiemn ambassador here. Ignaclo Bonillas, had attempted lo spread Bol shevist propaganda in this country, drew a denial tonight from the am bassador, who said in a formal state ment that he had done nothing to en courage disturbing elements in the United States or Mexico. Th- action of the committee in de ciding to send representatives to" see the president brought to a focus much cloak room speculation as to the ex tent lb which Mr. Wilson's Illness has handicapped him in the discharge or his omcial duties. Dr. Grayson Will Supervise, When informed of the proposal late mis atternoon Dr. Crayson said he would rather not permit such a con ference to take place tonight but fully expected the president would be able to see the two senators tomorrow. The physician expects .to confer with them before they are admitted to the sick room, however, and indicated he would object to any attempt to heckle the president or involveTum in any sharp discussion. Earlier in, the day Dr. Grayson had announced that Mr. Wilson's im provement had become more marked ami that he was being permitted to do an increasing amount of work. He said it was not necessary for the pa tient to use a wheel chair all of the time that he was out of bed and that during the morning he had been able to go over some official papers and sign some nominations.

It was felt that an order from the government such as was issued by President Taft in 1912 ordering Amer icans to uit Mexico, would create an ill-feeling south of the border and might cause bloodshed. The problem of getting the Ameri cans out of Mexico should diplomatic relations be broken, would be a diffi cult one. according to their employers, for they are scattered throughout the country and many are great distances from railroads and telegra.ph lines. Companies preparing to get their employes home hesitated today to permit publication Of their intentions. 'Jiien it was decided that the situa tion appeared so critical that notice of their action rriight point the way to safety - to other Americans in the in terior.

Ambassador Bonillas said his gov ernment not did not wish to forment disorder in the United States or spread radical doctrine, but had taken energetic steps to prevent its spread in Mexico. The ambassador said in his state ment: "Senator Fall's charges greatly sur prise me, for the hurtfulnes of them must be obvious to all. i I have been the ambassador of Mexico and sesiding in Washington as such for two years and eight months, and I have not during that time or at any other time done am-thing to fos ter. encourage or aia, actively or in actively, directly or indirectly, any of tne disturbing elements referred to either in the United Stales or io Mex ico.
