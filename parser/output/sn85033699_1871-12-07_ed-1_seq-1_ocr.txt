COLLEGE. . . , MLn,L"nportant resolution, introduced in ' the 'House yesterday by Col. McGhee, of "Knox) in regard to the Agricultural College, will be found in our columns' .elsewhere. The object of the resolution is to procure free transportation.o.TBr.thWarious railroads .fBlfchfilStatc for the students nominated to : (the-East Tennessee University from the t yaurioW counties in the State. ; m. -Thl3 is a timely and well considered prop osition, and, we believe, will fully attain the object In view. 'We cannot doubt that all , "the railroad companies in Tennessee will, ' at'once and cheerfully, comply "with the very reasonable request conveyed by the resolution, especially as they have been, in soSlarge a degree, the recipients of the State's bounty. They will no doubt gladly avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of making a graceful recognition of the State's'liberality by bestowing so hand - some and yet inexpensive a benefit upon her deserving children. QQVhile upon this subject we will say " further thattlie chief objection that has oc curred to our minds, and which has been urged by others, against the location of the , Agricultural College at Knoxville, was the cost to the students from the Middle and Western divisions, in getting to and from the college. AVe liave always felt that the .fund should not be divided, but as an original proposition, we preferred a more central location for the institution. When the object sought to be attained by the reso- Jjjjjution of Col. McGhee is accomplished, we shall feel that no serious objection can hereafter be urged on the ground of loca tionmerely; and in new of the provision of the law forbidding the removal of the fund by the Legislalurei we feel that the best m twe'can do is to unite in an earnest effort to make the college, as located, such an insti tution as will be an honor and lasting benefit to the State. ".A "TAMMAXY" SEJTATOK. The St. Louis Democrat (Radical) oppo ees the re-election of Mr. James Harlan as one of the United States Senators from Iowa, on the ground that "he lias been charged Villi a long series of delinquencies .Tvwhlle in the Cabinet of Mr. Lincoln'as Sec retary of the Interior, and he has never made satisfactory disproval or refutation." The Lemoarut says : .-. -"lie -has on one or two occasions de nounced the allegations as nothing but . ,-newspaper ilauders, the 'statements of ir- responsible newspapers,' etc; but a general denunciation wul not do where specific charges bf malfeasance and corruption are ,not only made, but, to all appearances, .proved. The war against Tammany was made up of 'irresponsible newspaper state ments,' and Mr. Tweed had just as much . s reason to complain on this score as Mr. Har lan has. The time has passed when men in public life can brush away an arraignment of their official conduct or of their 1f ( personal character with assertions of this 'kind. Newspapers have more at stake than Senators, and value their own reputation too highly to risk them in the wanttfn de- " struction of the reputation of a man hold ing the position of Mr. Harlan. So, when men like the Senator from Iowa can make no better defense of their conduct than to deny the 'responsibility' of their accusers, . they confess their guilt, and may as well 1 -make up their minds to retire from public life, unless they hae an unlimited amount of assurance and a constituency of a not very inquiring mind." For several months past the Washington correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette (Radical) has been making the seat of Sena tor Harlan decidedly hot and uncomfortable, and it is to these revelations that the De;?i ocral refers, and which Hailan denounces as the "statements of irresponsible news . papers." It will be remembered that this Senator was one of the most prominent supporters of the San Domingo swindle, in return for which Gen. Grant's Chaplain of 'theSenate wrote a letter urging his re-elec-" tion on religious grounds. But the Gazelle correspondent disturbs this well laid plot by asserting that in 1SCG, when Senator Harlan was Secretary of the Interior, he ordered the Commissioner of Pensions to turn over to a special agent the sum of $70,000, and to instruct him to proceed at once to the In jlian country, to pay certain Cherokee pen . 'siohers. The agent was to judge whether tbey were entitled to pensions, and he was authorized to retain and pay over to J. W. Wright, the agent, such fees as might be agreed upon between Wright and the Indi ans. Of this extraordinary order the cor rcspondent writes '. "In this case a long list of names sufficient to require S70.000 '"'for a first payment was added to the rolls by one paragraph o an order; in the sec ond paragraph they were called 'pen sioners,' and in the third a special agent was directed to pay them, imless he should ascertain that their names did not belong on the list." This transaction has lately been investigated, and It was found that in very few cases could any accurate. proof be obtained that those admitted to the rolls under the order had any right to be there. Of one hundred and two admitted and examined, fifty-nine were rejected. Of one hundred and fifty-two pending all were rejected. What became of the money which was intended for those whose claims were rejected? A second investigation is now in progress, and the Gazetted correspondent gives some facts to prove the character of Secretary Harlan's order: "An assistant secretary, on being applied to for a copy of it, said it could not, on any account, be fur nished, assigning as a reason tliat it would seriously injure Senator Harlan. A secre tary declined to allow it t ) be published, assigning the same reason. Another high official of the government, who, though fully aware of its contents, had no authori ty to furnish it, said that, if not withheld, it would cxerciso a most disastrous in fluence uku Senator Harlan's election.' " All Uiese facts are known at Washington, and yet Gen. Grant insists upon the re flection of Senator Harlan. Of course. This is the kind of men to bo used in tlio Senate by the ''King'' of plunderers, who bask in the sunshino of Presidential favor. "i-i -.i-ii-v-i-i-"i ii,irivr--i'i"rvi V-ivri- - iWIREQAECH 30, 1835.

The following nominations, -among otli errs, were sent to the Senate to-day: for Collectors of Customs, Willard Warner, Mobile, and Chester A. Arthur, New ,,York; Frederick Watts, of Pennsylvania, for Commissioner of Agriculture; " George Bancroft, of 2fewTjork, Envoy Extraordi nary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the German Empire; for Postmaster, S. Rexin ger, Glarksville, Tenn. . Secretory Fish to oar Klulstcr at St. Petersburg. The Fisb and Catacazy correspondence was sent to the Senate to-day. It is quite voluminous. A letter of Fisb to Minister Curtin, dated on the ICth of November last states that on his arrival in Washington, Catacazy gave promise of being a useful and very acceptable Minister, and made an agreeable impression. Soon, however, he began to make himself very officious, inter fering with questions not appropriately con nected with his legation, and in those pend ing before Congress, importuning Senators and Representatives,and resorting to personal interviews and solicitations unusual on the part of Representatives of other powers ac credited to this Government, distasteful and aimoying to the Legislatures thus indecor ously approached, and tending to embarrass the free course of legislation on the sub jects with respect to which his interference was obtruded he did not nesitate to use , the newspapers of the country to influence public opinion on questions pending ueiore ,the Government, and indulged much license in his denunciation of measures and individuals. In his conversation ho was even more severe and unrestrained, and employed abusive and vituperative lan guage to very many persons, including sev eral in public positions and enjoying the re spect and confidence of the community. The impropriety of a foreign minister thus attempting to influence and misdirect the. public opinion of the country must be ad mitted as a sufficient ground for his ceasing to be the proper agent between the govern ment which he represents and that to which he is accredited. Kn-Elnx Stevenson. Mr. Stevenson, of Ohio, offered a resolu tion in the Ku-Klux Committee to-day, for the removal of all disabilities, and to extend the time in which the habeas corpus may be suspended, and to make every Ku-Klux, and every member of any other treason able conspiracy, responsible civilly and criminally, for the acts of his fellow-members. The resolution was laid over for future consideration. Contested Scats. In the matter of the claims of W. T. Clark and D. C. Giddings of Texas, the committee on elections to-day directed counsel argue as to whether the certificate of Gov. Davis is ja prima facie evidence which entitles the proper party to his seat. Special to the IxraisTilte Ledger. An Act wlilcli Sunns Investigation. The proceedings yesterday and to-day show a deliberate purpose on tlie part of the Radical leaders in the Senate to stifle any discussion of Grant's acts in South Caroli na, lien, iiiair s resolution, similar u mai of Mr. Beck's, was well calculated to bring tbo disgraceful facts to light. He called for the names of the persons arrested, for the diarges against them, for the date of the al leged offenses, and also for the information on which Grant acted. It is known that the President did not act on the report of the Ku Klux Committee, and no one was authorized to inform him of the opinions of the committee, or the results of the committee's work. Senator Scott, of Pennsylvania, always ready for a dirty trick, sneaked up the back stairs cf the White House and approved the issuance of the martial law proclamation. When the matter came up to-day the Re publican Senators, with oue honorable ex ception (Mr. Tipton), voted to refuse to let the resolution be even considered. Trum bull and Sumner voted, along with Conk ling and Morton, to repress the inquiry. Others dodged the vote. The indications are not favorable to any extensive resist ance by Radicals to the military despotism of Grant. Sew Departure Republicans Noniicre. The formation of the anti-Grant wing re mains to be developed. It is evident the Democrats must begin their own fight against tyranny without waiting for out siders from tha so-called Independent Re publicans. Sanguine Stokes. Bald-eagle Stokes has arrived here, and proposes to defend himself nobly from the indictment charging him with complicity in the bounty frauds. If his word is good for anything, bis only defense consists in an ignorance of the law. lllodRCtt. A rumor has lately.been set afloat to the effect that Foster Blodgett will be admitted to a seat in the Senate. A careful canvass ofRepublican Senators demonstrates tliat he will be denied admission by a two-thirds vote, whatever the report of the committee may be. ISoiveii. Bigamous Bowen, it is announced, will turn up in "Washington after the holidays, as a contestant of Delarge's seat. Bowen procured his election to the Charleston Legislature, simply as a method of showing his local popularity. He will shortly re sfcrn. He is reported to have discovered that Delarge polled a very large number of fraudulent votes. Jie will come Here to make his fight as above stated. Relations with Cuba. Senators find considerable fault witb Grant's mention of Cuba in nis message. It is asserted that, according to the statement of facts therein made, he lias no more right to order our vessels to go there with hostile intent tlian during the San Domingo dis turbance. Senator Banks will call a meet ing of the Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday, with special reference to Cuban matters. Negro Appointees. Of the five colored men of the House of Representatives, thre arc upon the appoint ment list of yesterday, Delarge, of South Carolina, on the Committee on Manufac tures; Elliott, of the same State, on the Committee on Education and Labor, and Rainey, of the same State, on the Commit tee on Freedmen's Affairs.

VIRGINIA. Gov. Walker's Arraignment of Kadi- 1 calisni. Richmond, Dec. 0. The Lecislatnro or- gamzuu ic-uay. uov. waiKer's message recommends an amendment to the Consti tion, for holding all the Stale elections on the same day every two years, on a differ ent day from the Federal elections. Tin's change is regarded necessary in conse quence of the passage of an act bv Con gress, which, under the guise of regulating tne election ot congressmen, seeks to con trol the affairs of the State. The Governor recapitulates the arbitrary acts oi congress anu tne iTesident, and denounces their encroachments on the rights ot the people and the States, mrticn- larly of South Carolina. He says: We nave passed the terrible ordeal of attempted secession, hut the recoil has carried us to the other extreme, and the dangers which menaced the nation in 1801 are findin&r a parallel in 1871. Let the people demand me invioiaouity oi me habeas corpns, me su Domination ot the mili tary to the civil authorities. inTiolacy of the public faith, untarnished honesty in the administration of public affairs, purification, and reduction of tariffs and taxation to the lowest degree consist ent with the maintanceof the public credit, free education for all, the fostering and en couragement and elevation of labor, and nnaiiy universal and impartial suffrace, Aot until tbe people rise in their maiestv anu reassert tneir liberties now trampled on, not until patriotism has superseded partisan scinsnness, may we look for the in auguration of an era of good feeling. The Governor concludes with the hone that all good men throughout the land regardless of me past associations and alhJiations, will unite in aa honest and earnest effort to re deem the nation. 3IISS0UM. Very Much of n Muddle. St. Louis, Dec. C It appears that some statements contained in the dispatch tele graphed last night in regard to the action of uie Linarai itepublicau State Committee were not entirely correct. The Liberal version of the matter is that but six, or one-third, of the committee were present; that the meeting was not called by the chairman of the committee, and there fore not regular.nor would it have been com petent to transact business liad it been called by the Chairman, as less than a quorum of the Committee were present. it is iiinncr stated mat, ot the II persons present at me meeting, live were outsiders; that but three committeemen favored the unity the regular Republi can committee m calling a oiaie convention, mat me resolution pur- IHjmngio nave oeen passed hv the commit tee was opposed and withdrawn, and that me meeting adjourned witbout doing any thing.

Mr. DuBose called up House bill to amend the act establishing the Criminal Court of Knox county, and to create the office of District Attorney for the District of Knox, and asked that the Judiciary Committee, who had not reported, return the same to the Senate for action. Mr. Gibson made a lengtliy speech, In which he asked that the Senate would not support the request of Mr. DuBose, because it would be at variance with the rules ot courtesy practiced by tbe body, and a dis regard of the kindness which one senator owed the other. Mr. Gibson declared that the bill was for a political purpose, and its being called up was to insure its parage. While he recognized the political majority of the Senate, he thought such a course of unkindness and discourtesy for . political purposes was calculated to bury the pipe of peace and unearth the tomahawk of war, and said it seemed as if the Vandals and Goth3 of Middle and West Tennessee were about to overrun the counties of Knox and Roane. He felt sure the Senate would not approve the course of Mr. DuBose in seek ing to compel the committee to give up a bill before it had been acted upon. Mr. DuBose said he had no apology to make for what he had done. Mr. Gibson remarked that he asked no apology. Mi. UiutosQ said he could not get it 11 he desired, unless at the point of the sword that the Senator from Campell had by his frequent acts unworthy a gentlemen long j since placed lilmself beyond the pale of a gentleman deserving an apology; that be was sorry if anything said by himself had wounded the feelings of the committee. such not being hl3 intention or desire. But he meant what he said, lie spoke in a cool, calm manner, though he would con fess lus ire bad been somewhat raised by tbe minority report this morning of Mr. Gibson, whom he understood had not op posed the action of the committee in their views relative to the Revenue Bill, etc. Mr. Ridley said the remarks of the Sena tor from Campbell had suggested many points and thoughts of relative interest, which he did not entertain before. He was surprised to learn the Senator from Campbell (Mr. Gibson) had so much moral cdurage as to intimate the bill was one for a political purpose, lie was not aware 01 this fact until the Senator had made the announcement, and did not think it had anything to do with politics and political moves until so intimated by Mr, Gibson. It was unnecessary for him to defend one (Mr. DuBose) whose manly course and noble bearing had won for him the admi ration of that body from tbe attacks of one (Mr. Gibson) who for political prestige and to gain political power had, by thrusting himself in the Legislative byways and high ways and by lractious opposition em bittered himself in the minds of the Sena tors. Mr. Merritt, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, made a statement, saying he had, at every request of the Committee! brought the bill up before them for their consideration. The Senator from Roane (Mr. Staley) had requested that no report be made by the committee until the arrival of Mr. Thornburg, the Attorney General from that district, who he was expecting daily, so tliat he, with the Representative from that county, could confer with each other. Hence the delay of the committee in taking action and reporting, ne wanted the Senator from Roane (who had stated to him that he had not made up his mind to oppose the bill) and the members of the Senate, his political friends, to agree to its passage. The further consideration ot the bill was made the special order for ten o'clock to morrow morning. Adjourned to u:au a. m. to-morrow. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Wednesday, Dec C.

To amend tho revenue laws of the State, Mr. Orews spoke at some length In sup port of the bill, arguing that the privilege tax was unjust, unequal, unnecessary, and prejudicial to one of the most important in terests ot tlie state. Mr. Spears opposed the bill on the ground that the privilege tax was indirectly paid by consumers and not by the merchants. It was paid too by the class who could best afford it. The law as it stood on the statute books had been enacted at the suggestion of the merchants anu liau met with their ap proval before its passage. Under these circumstances and in view of the financial condition of the State, he hoped the House would reject the bill. Messrs. Odom, Gordon and Samscll spoke in opposition to the bill and Messrs.

It is the opinion of some pork packers that there will be ten per cent more hogs this year than last; otlicrs insist that though the hog crop will show a larger in crease in Indiana and throughout tlie Northwest, there will be a decrease in Ken tucky ; while one gentleman, a member of one of our leading firms, informed us that he expected to get more hogs, proportionately, from those localities in which the agents liad reported a falling off in the crop "tlian in others wlicre no decrease was claimed. There is an immense corn crop, which is selling at very low prices, aud which can be more profitable to the fanner by being put into pork than by being sent to market in any other way. This, it is claimed, will cause the farmers of Indiana to fatten every hog they can get hold of and will thus vastly increase the number driven to the slaughter pens. The same is said of the Northwest generally. in tlie zoological uaruens in Urusseis a largo artificial cave lia3 been constructed which contains a number of winding pas sages adorned with stalactites. In these are placed largo glass reservoirs within which fish of many different varieties dis port themselves. These aquaria are lighted by gas jets above, and standing before one of them the habits and motions of the fish can be studied at leisure with perfect ease. Some of the transparent tanks are inhabited by seals and crocodiles, while others are devoted to those curious creatures of the sea which seem to be rather flowers than fishes. Half a franc is the price of ad mission to this curious display, which is greatly admired by the honest citizens of Brussels, as well as by all strangers who visit the gardens.

The Hcssago Diplomatic Dexterity Westvrard tho Star of Umpire, etc. Loxdox, Dec. 6. President Grant's message is favorably received. The papers generally express satisfaction with tho spir it in which he deals with the relations be tween the two nations and the opinion is almost unanimous that tho condition of the country was never more flatteringly exlub ited. The Time in an article on the President's message congratulates the American Gov ernment on the dexterity of its diplomatic representatives in Europe during the Franco German war in preserving an Impartial at titude without losing- opportunities of dis playing practical sympathy for both sides.
