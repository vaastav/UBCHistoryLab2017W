LABOR BROTHERHOOD To be Organized on a Decent Realized BasIsProgressive Educational PolicyProhibition J CHICAGO December 6The limts will tomorrow publish the text of an address issued by Thomas B Barry outlining the lines and purposes of the new organization which he proposes shall be known as the II Brotherhood of United Labor In the address Barry says he is not advocating the formation of a new order for the purpose of fight i ing the Knights of Labor or to gratify his personal ambition but to establish honesty In and place the labor move ment on a decent realized basis which will make it forever almost impossible for cliques and rings to be formed to destroy in months the labor of years The organization it is stated will be established ON A DECE5T REALIZED BASIS It will leave to trades or branches com plete jurisdiction and control over their own affairs disputes or contro versies arise between members and thair employers they will be settled by those most conversant with the trouble and not by those who know nothing about the cause of complaint The order will maintain friendly rela tions with all limited organizations of labor It Will says the address draw the line closely on scabs and scabism It will urge the study of co operation and the means of bringing it into practice and will insist on mem bers giving fair manufacturers the preference when purchasing the neces saries of life it will pursue a PROGRESSIVE EDUCATIONAL POLICY to bring into practice andhave enacted into laws its platform of principles The cardinal principles of the brother hood will be to obtain currency and transportation reform j Jirsjt tJha right of man to use of the earth I Second The taking from usurers and Shylocks the right to control our currency ThirdGovernment ownership of the means of transporting persons freight and intelligence and the taking of those engines of hnman happiness out of the hands of stock gamblers and specula tors and to operate them for the BENEFIT OF THE PRODUCER AND CON SUMER While seeking a settlement of these questions the order will labor for the ameliorative terms such as the reduc tion of the hours of labor to eight per day prohibition of child labor the abolition of convict contract labor the abolition of the contract system on na tional Slate and municipal works the prohibition of foreign labor under con tract and purification of politics through the adoption of the Australian system of voting etc All of the details of the plan of the organization have not yet been decided on but it will ba more of a federation than compactlike body like the Knights of Labor In it there will be no money at the disposal of the general or federal officers for Barry claims the accumula tion of large sums of money at one cen tral point as in the old order is one of the greatest dangers to labor organiza tions The Seceding Knights COLUMBUS Ohio December 6 Dis trict Assembly 135 Knights of Labor concluded its business this
