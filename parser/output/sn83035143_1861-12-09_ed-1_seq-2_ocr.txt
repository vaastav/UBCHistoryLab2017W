Joui IMU4, sWmu. aomu Boo, e. A a. The Louisville Journal. W a ara not among thoae poraona or jour Bab that hara rendered idolatrous homaga to tba Louifville Journal, or ibj editor, (Jeorg U. Pientica. W have been read to give that per all due credit for having itood boldly for the Union and for battling against the rebels, bat hare not published column ol fulsome adulation of its editor for doing What wa simply the part of an honest and loyal maa. If we had, we should be heartily ashamed of it now. While we admired the boldness and true eloquence with which he dealt ponderous blows at the invading rebels, we did not forget that he denounotd the President's call for 75,000 troops last spring, and joined with the trait orous Governor in saying that Kentucky would sot furnish her quota. We also re membered that the Journal was an earnest supporter and upholder of the pretended neu trality of Kentucky, by which position, upon her part, the rebels were induced to enter fha Slate, and that it only came out boldly in fcvor ot fighting for the Union at all when the rebels had actually invaded the State and ware threatening Louisville. It oppo sition to the spirit of Fremont's proclamation we do not here notice, (as that was natural in a paper published in a slave State) except so far as its articles showed that it considered alaverr of, at least, as great value as the Union. Sut it is for its comments upon the Presi dent's message that we especially devote space in our columns at this time. These emments are unjust, unwise, unpatriotic and unpardonable. The? are ol a kind that we ( should expect to see in the Richmond Exam Uer, the Memphis Appeal or the Charleston Kercury, but not in a paper that professes to asr fairness or loyalty. We use the last L word advisedly, lor no article which has been puluiahed in all the loyal States daring the ' war, has been more full of opposition to the . Government. Along with this hostility to , the Government is an overweening vanity aed self righteousness that is most offensive, ' bat which is a mere secondary objection be side the greater one in this instance. That we may show the justice of these i ', comments we make a few extracts. In quot ing Mr. Lincoln's very moderate views upon the slavery question,tbe Journal sees in - them - "indirect and unmanly concurrence in the policy asserted recently by CoL Cochrane - ' and approved by Secretary Cameron to the . : morUncauon and ahame ol every loyal man ' in Kentucky. So that it is no matter what loyal men in l 'Ohl), Kesr York or New England may " think; no matter whether those views were L. , wise or otherwise; no matter whether they "' received the sanction of all the Cabinet or : not, they cause mortification to Kentuckians, , ; that is, to the Louisville Journal and hence they are "unmanly." In further comment ing upon the remark of the President that ' he will consider any more stringent laws - which Congress may adopt, relative to the . disposal of the property (and slaves) ol , rebels, the Journal uses these remarkable words, remarkable for their lurking treasoi What is to be done? There is but one ; thing to be done. The adoption of the ex treae measurea contemplated must be pre vented, or the nation is swallowed up. Of this we do not feel a shadow of doubt. But . how can the adoption of these measures be ' prevented? There appears to us to be three modes, in either of which the all important prevention may be attained. 1. The pros 1 ; perUy of our arms and of our cause general ' ly in a great degree that will put all pre. texts whatever for a resort to extreme meas ' sores out of the question. 2. The awaken ing of the conservative sentiment and en lightened loyalty ot the country, and bring ing bkhb to oear on tne President witn a ' force which he cannot as an honest and ra tional man withstand. 3. The resolution of . the Commander-in-Chief in the field, and of lug principal associates in command, to sur render their swords rather than link them ''--with the infamy of such measures. The . first of these three modes is for the most part beyond the reach of the people. We have ' fkiih in it, bnt it . should not be relied on blindly. The last mode is our last hope, if , everything else iajls, this may save us. If it does not, we are irretrievably lost as a na tion.' . ' - Here the Journal directly and unequivo cally put slavery above the Union and Con stitution, and says directly to the officers of the Union army, "if you are called upon, by tha emergencies of war, or by the voice ot "! your superiors, to lay a hand upon slavery that it may nUl and the Union stand, then It to your duty to refuse to obey, and to , break your swords and abandon the army to it fate in the face of the enemy, caring for .. nothing, preserving nothing but slavery." U this is not aiding the enemy and tending to destroy the efficiency of the Union army, theft it would bo difficult to find words that r would do it; and if the ten thousand Ken tucky soldiers take the Journal for their guide, we would not give much for their ser - vices hereafter. But that paper not only point the way to insubordination and dis ' trust, but says, u this task can be performed . successfully." Of course it can, and it Is ... only necessary that half a hundred papers . throughout the North and semi-loyal South. . era Elates, follow the lead of the Journal ' for one month, to perform it . But thank , Gol, there will not be half a dozen influ- eoiial journals to do this. ;j Tb Journal would have "the loyal men of the South rife op as one man, and tell the President he know not what he doe." AnS we would have the President risu up and tell the men of both South and North, loyd and disloyal, that he doe know what be doe, and if they are not ready to hold the country above - faction, loyalty above ' neutrality," and the Unien above the con venience and profit ot the slaveholding rebel, their advice and wrath will be alike disre garded. We have ddvjted so mnch space to this matter, because the Journal la probably seen more by our soldiers In Kentucky than any other paper, and Northern presses sho'tld endeavor to counteract the evil influences of such article a this on. To show that the Journal is not, (as it seem to imagine) the mouthpiece of all Kentucky, we copy the following paragraph from the Frankfort Commonwealth, published at the Capital of that StaUx : The Louisville Journal of yesterday morn ing contained an article ou the President's message wuicu mun create a universal icei ing of astouishuient and regret in tlie mind of everv well wisher of his country. The article is detormed by a vein of ridiculous vanity, coupled with an assumption ot re markable influence, which the writer fondly believe flows from the point of his pen whenever it come in contact with oaper.- Aside from the wretched taste of criti 'lsm, it is exceedingly ill-timed, and unjust to the fresiilent. The Treasury Report. The report of Secretary Chase will be looked for with at least equal anxiety to that displayed for the President's Kessage. The New York Tribune professes to have the substance of what it will contain, as fol lows : It will, as we are assured, be a thorough exposition of the financial condition and prospects of the country, and will recom mend measures of the gravest importance. It is understood that the leading feature of his report will be a recommendRticn of a tax upon bank notes, which will have the iffect to remove them from circulation, and to supply in their place the currency of the United States. The plan of the Secretary meets, as we are assured, with tha cordial approbation of the banks and capitalists, so that no difficulty witn the moneyed inter est will grow out of the sulstitutiox It is probable that the question will be raised as to the constitutionality of banks erected under State laws, and their right to affect the value of gold and silver. The advantages o currency for which the faith of the nation, with all its resources, stand pledged, over one wnicn depends upon the laws ct thirty four different States, and upon the faith of more than sixteen hundred co-operations, will be urged. Secretary Chase will take ground In favor of the confiscation of the property of rebels as a means of revenue, but will boll that slaves must form an exception, inasmuch as tne National Government cannot become Ue owner of slaves. He favors their release from the authority of rebel masters, how ever, and their employment in various use ful occupations, with compensation, which shall render them a more profitable class of population than they are in their present condition as slaves. , We are informed that an additional duty upon tea, sugar, and coffee will be recom mended, and also an excise duty upen all distilled liquors, still-", Ac., and upon tobac co. A tax upon bank notes, evidences of debt, and upon conveyances, will also be recommended. The Secretary estimates that the public debt will amount to about $800,000,003. Items from Port Royal. THE 

REBELS BURNING COTTON. Four days before the Vanderbilt sailed, gnu-boat went up one of the rivers in the vicinity of IPort Royal and remained over night. On the passage up vast quantities of cotton were discovered stored realy for gin ning. The gnn-boat penetrated for several miles. No rebels were discovered, b'lt on the return, the cotton which bad been no ticed was found on fire ; and as fer as could be seen in all directiors, dense smoie rose in clouds, indicating that an organised effort to burn all the cotton, and probably ctber prop erty, had been made. The rebels, it thought, were under the impression that the vessel bad come tor the purpose of sermg it. However, not a single white man vras seen. The reconnoisancea have reverJed the fact that vast quantities ot cotton are stored upon the numerous small creeks and inlets, within easy reach of our forces. It is, in nearly all cases, ready tor ginning. THE FORTIFICATIONS OF HILTON HEAD. Nearly the entire force of Gen. Sherman yet remains on Hilton Head Island. The entrenchments in progress are rrpijly no preaching completion. They begin on the mainland Bide of the island, a mile nnd a half from Fort Walker, and are about three miles in length. . The works consist ot a ditch, with a breastwork, and wi'.l, when completed, entirely protect the island from any attack which could be made from the mainland. The work is performed under the superintendence of Capt. Gilmore, of the Engineer Corps, formerly stationed on Gov ernor's Island. The improvements heretofore reported as in progress at Hilton Head are going on ex peditiously. Koads are building: and the wharf, when the carpenters and laborers to be sent from this city arrive, will soon Le completed. CONTRABANDS AT WORK. It is certainly very amusing to observe these contrabands engaged at what, in a measure, has been misnamed "work." Ia order to transport a bale of hay a distance of from twenty to thirty yards it ta; about eighteen or twenty laborers mm and ;boys who perform the operation somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty minutes. First, one will give it a turn over, roll his body on it, dropdown on his elbowaj and have a quiet grin for several seconds. Then it will be passed to the next one, who proves to be a perfect genius in the art ot iiritaticn ; and so on it goes through the whole gang. At times the gangs will suddenly grow small and beautifully less in censequence cf some of the laborers having decided to anuse themselves a la Heenan, others baring start ed off on foot races, and more resolved on getting up an impromptu "circus. Just about this juncture a sergeant nay be seen re-collecting the scapegoats by dint of a resort to summary expedients and a very powerful use of his lungs. Not enfreouent- ly air. Contraband is mode aware of the feet that there i an "all seeing" eye, by havine a brick pass his legs with considerable rapidity at a distance rather too close for personal comfort. When I doscribe how a bale of hay is unloaded, the description will serve as a very safe criterion by which to.'udge the manner in which every thing elsa is removed and stored away. It is not unusual to see half a dozen negroes wheeling a hand-cart generally with nothing in it; a coal cart backed np in a heap of lumber al-iost off toe dock, or into tone other cart or wagon, rather than where it is wanted; eight or ten "darkeys" removing a stick of lumber, while the same number are engtged in warm ing their feet or dancing a jig; little ebonies hurrahing for some notability in the hope of getting a penny from a passing c33er; more little blacks playing soldier, scamnarinir aft.r a band of music, or throwic j dast; and wencoos swaggering, gunning, and capering by th roadside, or coquetting with their fellows. 200,000 More Volunteers. A disn&tch to the Time aya that a propc. sition for enlisting 200,000 additional volar, teers will be Introduced in Congress, and it is understood to meet the approve! o" the Sec retary oj War. " The Case of Rev. George Gordon. The United State ) In the District Court of v. i-Ohio. Tried at lb fio- George Gordon, j Timber Term, 1861. This was a prosecution for a violation ot the 00th Sec. of th A'' ior the punishment of crime, found in Brightly' Statutes, page 112, and passed April 30, 1790. The section punishes any person who shall knowingly and willfully obstruct, resist or oppose any officer of the United States, in serving or at tempting to serve or execute any writ, process, warrant, &&, issued by any person authorized to issue the same, by Imprison ment, not exceeding twelve months, and by fine not exceeding three hundred dollars. The defendant was indicted at the November Term, 1860. The testimony on the trial established, be yond a rational doubt, that on the l'-'th day ot September, 18C0, three men from Ken tucky came to Cincinnati, and made affidavit before U. S. Commissioner Newhall, that three persons owing them service and labor In Kentucky, had fled, and were then in the State "of Ohio. They procured three war rants and placed them in the hands of Mar shal Siflbrd of the Southern District, liar shal Sifford called to his assistance two ot his deputies and two or three other men be side the Kentuckians, and the company on the 10th of September left for the vicinity of Iberia, where they understood the slaves were. A short distance from Iberia the company left the cars, and soon after, under the orders and directions of Marshal Sifford, they sepa rated, Joseph L. Barber, one of the Deputy Marshals, taking a warrant for Granderson Martin, and taking two of the company with him, went as he was directed, to the house of James Hammond, where it was supposed Martin was. When he arrived at the house it had begun to grow dark. He knocked at the door, and a lady came to it, of whom Barber enquired if a colored boy was there by the name of Martin. He was told he was not. He then enquired If such a person had not been there, and was answered in the affirmative. He asked where he then was, and th lady said she did not know, and 3he did she would not toll. Barber told her he had a warrant for Martin's irrest, and it was his daty to be satisfied be was not there. The lady lighted a candle, gave it to him, and told him he could search the house, which Barber did slightly, bat to his satis faction, no other person entering the house, Mr. Barber and his associates then left, and went back to a point on the railroad, some mile and a-half, where they by agreement, were to report themselves. Soon after they reached the railroad, and while waiting there for the arrival of the other companies, men began to collect and enquire their business, accusing them of being robbers and thieves. Mr. Barber assured them that they were not robbers or thieves, but that they were on legitimate business. There was in company with Mr. Barber at this time a Mr. Benick, of Columbus. The crowd now numbered some fifteen or twenty, and grew more and more boisterous and excited. Mr. Barber, thinking bis safety required it, now told them that he was Deputy United State Marshal, that he had warrant to serve, explained the nature of it, and demanded their protection and assistance. At this they became more excited than ever, and began to threaten to hang them, the crowd all the time increasing. The crowd now seized Barber and Benick, and took them some half a mile from where they were, and off the railroad track, to the edge of piece of woods. After looking for a suitable tree from which to hang them, and boasting that a halter had been procured for the pur pose, the crowd changed their minds and con eluded to shoot them. Barber and Benick were now separated some forty feet, and held and searched. On Mr. Barber they found a wallet, containing his private papers and about $24 in money, his pistol, a small Bowie-knife, his warrant and a let ter from Mr. Sifford. To secure the wallet, they tore the pocket from hi pantaloons. The crowd then demanded that Barber and Benick should kneel with their faces in op posite directions and some thirty paces apart, declaring that they would shoot them. Renick obeyed, but Barber refused. They then stripped off Barber s overcoat, dress coat, vest and shirt, leaving his under- shirt In this condition they seized him and by force put him neon his knees. A file of three or tour men was then drawn up in front of him, and orders given to cock their guns, make ready, and take aim; all of which was gone through with. It was then suggested that they should not shoot them, but that they should be whipped uutil they told where the colored boy was. Barber as sured them that he did not know, that he had seen nothing of him, and did not know that any had been arrested. Two or three men seized each of Mr. B.'s hands, pulling bis arms out at full length, and two colored men, one a very large athletic man, with large limbs cut from the trees proceeded to lash him in the most brutal manner, whip ping him until the small branches were worn from the limb and the colored men exhausted, and Mr. Barber, larcerated and bleeding, having upon him several gashes one and a half inches in length, and his right arm, with which h attempted at time to avertthe blows, so bruised that kthe next day it was swollen to twice its usual size. Daring this Hogging the muzzle of a gun was thrust anst his side with such vio lence that from the effect he has not re covered. Mr. Benick during this time was receiv ing similar treatment at th hands of an other portion of the company, though not severe. Barber and Bennick were now ordered to their feet, and commenced dress- sing, when Mr. Gordon gave one of the color. ed men a whip, saying, "they have not got enough yet, give them some more," and some twelve or fifteen blows were well laid on. The company then proceeded with scis sors to shear the heads of Barber and Ben ick, and in this made thorough work. Mr. Gordon then administered an obligation to them to the effect that they would never again vote the Democratic ticket, or be en gaged in arresting a fugitive (lave. He then lectured them Irani five to ten minutes on the enormity of their crime, and assured them that they had been for tunate in falling into the hands of the better portion of community, stating if they had fallen Into the hands of the Boughs they would have fared much worse. Barber and Benick were then, about one o'clock at night, permitted to put on their clothes. Barber asked that his money, papers,and other things taken from him, be given to him. This was not done, some one remarking that he had no business there, and that he did not deserve them. During th time after the company left the railroad to the close Mr. Gordon was present, actively engaged In tbtte proceed ings, and when hi name was mentioned cautioned those present not to use names. During the most of the time there were from 30 to 60 men prestnt. Boon after this trans action Mr. Gordon left and was understood to be in Canada. I think In April last, he came to me and voluntarily entered securi- tie for hi appearance at Court. Until after hi trial no bond but hi own was required. I do not say that the foregoing is literally true. But I do say that it is a faithful nar rative of what the testimony disclosed on the trial, and that there was no testimony which in the slightest degree tended to contradict It or modify It effect. And for the truth of this I refer to tha Court, the Jurors, the De fendant' Attornies, and every other person who listened to the trial. This is the cue I inheirited from my pre decessor, with the recorded evidence taken before the Grand Jury. I eiamined the tes timony. I thought it ought to be prosecuted. I tried, without unusual zeal or resort to un usual technical or dishonorable means, to pro cure a conviction. The jury was made up of eleven Republicans and one Democrat. The charge of the Court was most impartial as was admitted by Defendant' Attornies. The jury without a dissenting joic at once nronounced the defendant guilty. The Court sentenced him to one half the impris onment provided by the statutes, ff this sentence was too severe it is difficult to imag ine for what kind of a case the balance of the imprisonment was provided. The mis apprehension of the facts and perversion of the testimony, as well as the reflections cast upon all who have been officially connected with this case, have seemed to me to render it proper that I should make this statement at some length. I leave it with the single re gret that there should have been occasion for its existence. R. F. 

PAINE. Cotton in Illinois. We have before spoken of the successful experiments which have been made to raise cotton in lower Illinois. The Chicago Tri bune has information from an unquestioned source that fiv thousand acres in that State will be planted with cotton the coming year. As it has been shown that it is the prospective, and not present want of cotton which alarms the English manufacturers (they having on hand a six months' stock and a nearly equal amount being expected from India) we can look with comparative complacency upon the burning of their cot ton by the Carolina planters, and wait the incoming of the Illinois orop with which to keep English mills supplied.
