TWO CENTa PROGRAM TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS OF LABOR IS PRESENT U. S. NEED, PRESIDENT DECLARES TO CONGRESS Peace Treaty Is Only Subject of Casual Reference. RECOMMENDS THE BUDGET SYSTEM Mesrage Is First to Opening of a Session He Has Not De livered in Person. Xeed of "a definite program to bring shout an improvement in the condi tions of labor" formed the burden of President Wilson's message to the first regular session of the Sixty-sixth ?'ongress today, and only casual refer ence was made to the failure of the Senate to ratify the peace treaty, which. it is understood, will be the subject of a future message. The President also says that the matter of the railroads and the re adjustment of their affairs growing c>ut of federal control will be the sub ject of a later message. Outatandlng Features. The outstanding features of his mes sage today are recommendations for the establishment of a budget sys- | tem. a more comprehensive system of | iMiditing national expenditures, rec ognition and relief for ex-service men. encouragement of food production and nood roads, extension of the food con trol act, more drastic laws to deal ?with enemies of the government, fed eral licenses for corporations doing r.n interstate business, simplification of the income and profits taxes, and a concise discussion of industrial prob lems. < onnulted A??oclate?. This was the first message that President Wilson has sent to the open ing of a session of Congress that he has not delivered in person, but in the first paragraph he stated that in its preparation he had had the advice of the heads of several executive de partments, "who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly second." Of the ten printed pages which the message filled, three were given over to the question of labor. The Presi dent said it was the duty of Congress to help find a method "that will bring about a genuine democratixation of industry, based on the full recognition of the right of those who work, in w hatever rank, to participate In some organic way In every decision which directly aiTecfs their welfare." Reteresec'fo TiM). Reference to the failure of the United Ftates to ratify the peace treaty is made in the discussion of political restless ness. concerning which the President wrote: "The causes of this unrest, while va rious and complicated, are superficial rather than deep-sapted. Broadly, they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a Just and permanent peace, permitting a return to normal conditions: from the tranfusion of radi cal theories from seething European centers pending such delay, from heart less profiteering resulting in the in crease of the coet of living, and. lastly, from the machinations or passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear." Labor Principle* In Leasee. "The establishment of the prin ciples regarding labor, laid down in the covenant of the league of na tions." said the message, "offers us the way to industrial peace and con ciliation. No other road lies open to lis. ? ? ? Governments must recog nite the right of men to bargain col lectively for humane objects. ? ? ? l.abor must no longer be treated as a commodity. "The right of individuals to strike is inviolate," continues the message, "and ought not to be interfered with by any process of government, but there is a predominant right and thut is the right of the government to pro tect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the chal lenge of any class." <? The President was referring to the government's recent injunction against the coal strike. Runata an Object Leaaoa. The message closed with a pointed reference to radicalism, red doctrines and referred to "Russia today, with its blood arid terror." as a "painful object lesson of the power of minorities." "There are those in this country." paid the message, "who threaten direct action to force their will upon a ma jority. ? * ? it makes little differ ence what minority it is. whether capi tal or labor, or any other class, no sort of privilege will ever be per mitted to dominate this country." Orderly processes, the message de clared. were the only ones by which relief and reform might be obtained. Those who would propose any other | method of reform are enemies of this <ountrv," the message said. '? ? ? ? Let those beware who take! the shorter road of disorder and revolu- | t ion."

Text of President Wilson's Message to 66th Congress To the Senate and House of Rep resentatives: I sincerely regret that I cannot be present at the opening of this session of the Congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct <1 way as I could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily. I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly sec ond. In the matter of the railroads ! and the readjustment of their af fairs growing out of federal con trol. I shall take the liberty at a later date of addressing you. 1 hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at 'his session leg islation looking to the establish ment of a budget system. That there should be one single authori ty responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appro priations should be made not in dependently of each other, but with reference to one single compre hensive plan of expenditure prop erly related to the nation's in come, there can be no doubt. I be lieve the burden of preparing the budget must, in the nature of the case, if the work is to be properly done and responsibility concentrat ed instead of divided, rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and ap proved or amended by a single committee of each house of Con gress and no single appropriation should be made bv the Congress, except such as may have been in cluded in the budget prepared by the executive or added by the par ticular committee of Congress charged with the budget legisla tion. Economy In Expenses. Another and not less important aspect of the problem is the ascer tainment of the economy and effi ciency with which the moneys ap propriated are expended. Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the appropriations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, economically and effectively. The auditors should be highly trained officials with per manent tenure in the Treasury De partment, free of obligations to or motives of consideration for this or any subsequent administration, and authorized and empowered to examine into and make report upon the method* employed and the re sults obtained by the executive de partments of the governrhent. Their reports should be made to the Congress and to the Secretary of the Treasury. I truat that the Congress will give its immediate consideration to the- problem of future taxation. Simplification of the income and profits taxes hag become an im mediate necessity. These taxes performed indispensable service during the war. They must, how ever, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense, but in order that his lia bility may be made certain and definite. With reference to the details of the revenue law. the Secretary of the Treasury and the commission er of internal revenue will lay be fore you for your consideration certain amendments necessary or desirable in connection with the administration of the law?recom mendations which have my ap proval and support. It is of the ut most importance that in dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year 1920. payable in the calendar year 1921. The Congress might well consider whether the higher rates of income and profits taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of revenue, and wheth er they may not. on the contrary, be destructive of business activity and productive of waste and inef ficiency. There is a point at which in peace times high rates of in come and profits taxes discourage energy, remove the incentive to new enterprise, encourage extrav agant expenditures and produce industrial stagnation with conse quent unemployment and other at tendant evils America'* Position thonged. The problem is not an easy one. A fundamental change has taken place with reference to the position of America in the world's affairs. The prejudice and passions engendered by decades of controversy- between two schools of political and economic thought?the one believers in protec tion of American industries, the other believers in tariff for revenue only?must be subordinated to the single consideration of the public in terest in the light of utterly changed conditions. Before the war America was heavily the debtor of the rest of the world and the interest payments she had to make to foreign countries on American securities held abroad, the expend;tures of American travel ers abroad and tfie ocean freight charges she had to pay to others, about balanced the value of her pre war favorable balance of trade. Dur ing the war America's exports have been ereatly stimulated, and in creased prices have increased their [ value. On the other nana, she has | purchased a large proportion of the | American securities previously held j abroad, has loaned some $9,000,000.- i 000 to foreign governments, and has bu'lt her own ships. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly increased I and Europe has been deprived of j the means of meeting it heretofore I existing. Europe can have only three ways of meeting the favor able balance of trade in peace times: by imports into this coun try of gold or of goods, or by es tablishing new credits. Europe is in no position at the present time to ship gold to ufl nor could we contemplate large further imports of gold into this country without concern. The time has nearly passed for international govern mental loans and it will take time to develop In this country a mar ket for foreign securities. Any thing. therefore, which would tend to prevent foreign countries from settling for our exports by ship ments of goods into this country could only have the effect of pre venting them from paying for our exports and therefore of prevent ing the exports from being made. The productivity of the country vreatly stimulated by the war must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries and any measures taken to prevent imports will inevitably curtail exports, force curtailment ?>f production, load the banking ma chinery ot the country with credit* I to carry unsold products and pro duce industrial stagnation and un 1 employment, if we want to sell, we must be prepared to buy. What ever, therefore, may have been our views during the period of growth of American business concerning | tariff legislation, we must now ad just our own economic life to a I changed condition growing out of the fact that American business is i lull grown and that America is the greatest capitalist in the world. Isolation I nxat isfactory. No policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportuni ties of America. The provincial standards and policies of the past, which have held American busi ness as if in a strait-jacket, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live, a day full of hope and promise for American business, if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that arc ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our isolation an# thrown upon us a great duty and responsi bility. The United States must share the expanding world market. The I'nited States desires for it self only equal opportunity with the other nations of the world, and that through the process of friend ly co-operation and fair competi tion the legitimate interests of the nations concerned may be success fully and equitably adjusted. There are other matters of im portance upon which I urged ac tion at the last session of Con gress which are still pressing for solution. I am sure it is not neces sary for me again to remind you that there is one immediate and very practicable question resulting from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit. It is a matter of recognition and relief to our soldiers. I can do no better than to quote from my last message urging this very action: "We must see to it that our re turning soldiers are assisted in every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organization created by the Department of Labor for placing men seeking work, and it can also be done, in at least one very great field, by creating new opportunities for individual enter prise. The Secretary of the In terior has pointed out the way by which returning soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto undeveloped regions of the country which the federal gov ernment has already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation, and also on many of the cutover or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states;?and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shall receive the Imme diate and substantial support of the Congress." HecuII* Tariff Statement*. In the matter of tariff legisla tion, I beg to call your attention to the statements contained In my last message urging legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestufTs indus try in America: "Among the industries to which special consideration should be given is that of the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals. Our complete dependence upon Ger- i man supplies before the war made the interruption of trade a cause of exceptional economic disturb ance. The close relation between the manufacturer of dyestuffs. on the one hand, and of explosives I and poisonous gases, on the other. ' moreover, has given the industry an exceptional significance and val ue. Although the I'nited States will gladly and unhesitatingly join in the program of international dis- I armament, it will, nevertheless, be I a policy of obvious prudence to j make certain of the successful maintenance of many strong and well equipped chemical plants. The German chemical industry, with which we will be brought into com petition, was and may well' be again, a thoroughly knit monopoly capable of exercising a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dan gerous kind." ? Farmers' Service Vital. During the war the farmer per formed a vital and willing service to the nation. By materially In- ! creasing the production of his land, I he supplied America and the allies with the increased amounts of food necessary to keep their immense armies in the field. He indispensa bly helped to win the war But there is now scarcely less need of increasing the production in food and the necessaries of life. I ask : the Congress to consider means of encouraging effort along these lines. The importance of doing everything possible to promote ! production, along economical lines to improve marketing and to make j lUr^!v.rU,te, "i?re attractive and healthful, is obvious. I would urge approval of the plans already pro posed to tlie Congress bv the Sec- i retary of Agriculture to "secure the ! essential facts required for the ' proper study of this question, through the proposed enlarged programs for farm management studies and crop estimates I i would urge. also, the continuance of federal participation in the building of good roads, under the terms of existing law and under the direction of present agencies the need of further action on the part of the states and the federal government to preserve and de velop our forest resources, espe cially through the practice of bet ter forestry methods on private holdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests; better sup port for country schools and the more definite direction of their courses of study along lines related to rural problems; and fuller pro vision for sanitation in rural dis tricts and the building up of need ed hospital and medical facilities in these localities. Perhaps the way might be cleared for many of these desirable reforms by a fresh, comprehensive survey made of rural conditions by a con ference composed of repreeenta- , lives of the farmers and of the ag- , rlcult ural agencies responsible for : leadership Political In rent Superficial. 1 would call your attention to the widespread condition of polit- I ical restlessness in our body politic. !

Rousing herself later she listen ed attentively to Andrew Bonar Law. who. like Air. Chamberlain, opposed the premium bond meas ure.

NEW FUEL ORDER IS MORE DRASTIC THANDIJRING WAR Industries Not Essential to I Be Cut Off, Necessary Ones Closely Watched. 'Air-tight restrictions, more drastic than the war-time fuel regulations, are provided by the new fuel admin istration's order issued yesterday. The nation is faced with an alarming dearth of coal and the saving of every ton possible is deemed imperative. All industries not absolutely essential will be rigidly cut off and points of wastage in the essential industries will be closely watched. i Application of fuel restrictions in Washington is in the hands of the central coal committee of the rail road administration, it was said at the -fuel Administration today. The committee knows accurately the needs of the city and will endeavor to make satisfactory regulations locally as the national and regional coal crisis is altered from day to day. Auk People ?o Be Tolerant. To quiet probable unrest among the public, the people are called upon by the fuel administration and the De partment of Justice to exercise pa tience and tolerance, and to assist in ?fuel conservation by reducing their needs to the minimum. Federal Fuel Administrator Garfield | has announced that distribution of j coal will be limited to the first five classes of the priority list issued Octo ber 31. The first five classes thus con sidered essential are: Railroads and inland and coastwise waterways. Army and Navy and other federal govern ment departments: state, county and municipal departments and institu tions: public utilities and retail deal ers. It was learned that if it becomes necessary to apply the rigid new rules restricting use of fuel in the District of Columbia electric displav signs theaters, motion picture houses and lighting of show windows of stores probably will be the first to feel the effect. These, it was stated, are con sidered non-essential, and use of coal to produce power for their use will be forbidden, in order to increase the fuel supplies for other and more essential purposes. It was intimated that the first effort will be to conserve fuel for domestic use, for schools, for retail stores and for industrial plants producing such essentials as food commodities, cloth mgr. etc. f oal Supply Sil uation. Annual coal requirements of Wash ington are about 500,000 tons of an thracite and about 500.000 tons of bi tuminous. according to official statistics A very recent survey showed that a large proportion of apartment houses thirf,- Jl han.d a s"PPl.v to last from thirty to sixty da\s. Government de partment buildings are prettv well provided. Private business houses and office buildings and hotels in most i? ,an~Ps have ,lot much reserve of fuel. Their space is too valuable to be used for the storage of much coal Figures were not immediately avjil able regarding the coal reserves of the gas and electric companies, but in [any eventuality, it was pointed out 1 these interests would be provided for because the actual necessities or the city's population are almost wholly de pendent on them. With the latest information at hand fron> all sections of the country re j garding daily coal supplies the' cen tra! committee will apply to Wash ington regulations covering the u.*e of fuel, electricity and ?as by non essential industries, just the same as i those applied ill other cities. As the need arises, local investigators will watch conditions in the District. Of ficials would not say how soon the 'non-essentials" would be cut off Abundance of Pen ( oal. There is now in Washington, ac cording to one authority, an apparent surplus of anthracite pea coal, and at the mines there is a supply available for the city's use in the future. Pea coal is an unpopular size and ordinarily is not in great demand. Mixed hail' and half with soft coal it is said to be an excellent steam coal, for use not only in power plants but also in steam and hot-water heat ing plants. The fuel administration's decision to restrict present coal consumption is in order to avert a coal famine in the dead of winter. At the same tin-.e it appealed to the public to endure fri vatior.s, and to the miners to return to work. The Attorney Genera! gives every indication the government will break the illegal coal strike if it takes all winter to do so. in order to protect the public from yet higher living costs He asserted 1: would be idle to reopen negotiations regarding wages in a parley between operators and miners. Pan-American Round Table Meets. SAN 

ANTONIO, Tex.. December ? The first annual conference of the Pan-American round table is in ses sion here. Five women of Mexico and a number from California. Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are in attend ance. 1 Bureau Figures on Living Expense of Single Man and Single Woman. Statistics brought strictly u|> to date, covering the total budget of expense for a single man and a single woman in the clerical service of government in Washington, show that, a total bud get of $1,067.78 is necessary for the man and a total budget of $1,151.15 Is necessary to maintain level of health and decency for the single woman. ccrding to announcement today by tne bureau of labor statistics. These fig mes include an allowance of 10 per cent of the total expense of each em ploye for savings, and have been used by the joint congressional committee on reclassification as a basis for consid ering increases to this class of govern ment workers. Item* In Woninn'n K*pen*e. Th? figures for the wom?fl include an item of $46.50 for carfare at 6H : cents per ride, as against former fig I ures at a fiat 5-cent rate of $37.20 a year. The largest items in theVbudget. made public today are, of course, board and room and clothing. The bureau in an investigation covering fifty houses ir. various sections of Washing ^ ton, including commercial boarding ! houses and private homes, found that the approximate minimum cost of I room in a house with bath facilities I for two in a room was $15 per month per person. This item amounts to $180 a year. It is pointed out in the report, that an allowance of $15 a | month is considerably lower than the rate for rooms at the government dor mitories. where $20 per month per person is charged. The bureau found j that the approximate cost of regular j table board, including two meals on | week days and three on Sunday was I at the rate of $312 a year. Clothing, I the other large item in the list of ex I penditures. cost $240.15 per year. Con* of l.unrheft. Lunches at 25 cents per day cost_ the woman government worker $78.25 per vear, and this expense is gupple ?mented' by an item for other food, fruit, confectionery, etc., amounting to $13 a year. The cost of belonging to labor organizations averages $5 a year and an item for subscription to a daily newspaper of $8.40 is in cluded. For amusements and recrea tion it is estimated that the govern ment woman worker spends $20 per *An outstanding feature of the re port is the fact that there is no al lowance made in the budget for vaca tion expenses and none for books ana magazines. The former item is ex plained by the fact that the regula tions of the government departments permit a reasonable amount of an nual leave with pay and it is assumed that a vacation would not exceed the salary paid during the leave period, i Difference In Occupation Cited. I The report points out that on a.c I count of the difference in occupation i the woman employe of the govern ' ment is required to buy m?re and1 a : better Quality of clothing than the woman who stays at home. The unit price of the clothing necessary for the woman government worker in therefore given as a total of $305.15 while its annual replacement is placed at $">40.15. This does not make allow ance for any special clothing. The report states that since the study of the wage earners budget in lBlb. ' clothing prices in Washington have undoubtedly increased not less than ' 100 per cent and points out that 'in ' the light of such an increase the ) clothing budget appears sufficiently niggardly." , ? ,, An allowance for laundry at $1.25 I per week, or $65 per year, is made and 1 an item for health maintenance of $43 per year is included in the report. Xo reliable data existed at the time of the compilation of the report as to the use of transfers, for which an addi tional charge of 2 cents formerly was I made An amount equivalent to 10 i per cent of living expenses is held i by the bureau to be a reasonable basis for computation of savings of I both men and women. FlRnr?* for Single Man. The figures for the single man in j | the clerical service of the government ; do not vary greatly from those of the ! women. The figures for the men in- j ! dude greatly reduced items for cloth ' ing. health, "and laundry, making the j ! man's budget, smaller th.in that of the ' woman.

Koom and board for the man in gov- ; ernment employ cost him exactlv the! same as that for the womm, the bu-j ! reau reports, while the items of news- j ! papers, labor organizations and car j ! fare are the same in cost. , Allowance is made in the report fori I the single man for annual clothing ex ! pense of $158.36, in which he is allow i ed two suits at $20 each, two hats at i ! $2 each, one overcoat every four years I at $40, a raincoat every four years at] j $15, five shirts at. $?> each and a total budget of $17.25 for footwear.
