CAR PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Senate and lloun of Representatives 1 In coming before you for the first time as Chief Magistrate of this irreat nation,- It Is with great gratitude to ihe Giver of all good for the many benefits we enjoy. We are blessed with peace at home, and are without entangling alli ances abroad to foment trouble. With a terri tory unsurpassed In lertlllty, of uu area equal to tbe'abundant support of five hundred millions of people, and abouudlag in every variety of use ful mineral. In quantity sufficient to supply the world for generations j with exhuberant crops, with a variety of climate adapted to the produc tion of every species of earth's i tches and suited to Ihe lmbliK, tastes snd requirements of everv living thing, with a pepukitUMi. ol 40,000 000 office people, all sjieakln one language, with facilities for every mortal to acquire an educa tion. with institution ck'sing to none the u venues to fame or any bltff.ii)f of loi tune that may be coveted, with freedom of pulpit, the press and the school, with a levenue flowing into the No tional Treasury beyoud the requirements of gov ernment supply, hiiioiony Is being rapidly re etond wltliiu our on D borders. Manufactures hitherto unknown iu our country are springing, up in all directions, producing a" degree of na tional Independence lineqiinted by any other power. These blessings and countless' others are entrusted to your care, and more, for safe keeping lor the brief period ol our tenure of office. In a short time we must each of us re turn to the ranks of the people, who have eon ferred upon us our honors, and account to them for our stewardship. I earnestly desire neither you nor I may be eondeumt-d by a free and en lightened constituency, nor by our own con science. , . , Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic mag., nitude, aided as It was by the' sympathies and osMBionee of nations with which we were at peace, eleven Stales of Ihe Union were, four .wars ago, left without Iegf8inte Governments, a debt had ben eontiueted.AineiicaH commerce was alim.t-t diiveii ti on. lie fens, lie industry of one half of the counirv had been taken from the control of the capitalist, end phiied where all lubor rightfully belongs In the keeping of thelubonr. The woik ol ifftoiing the Stnte Governments loyal 10 ihe Union, of protecting and fostering f lee labor and bioviding menus for paying the initrett on the public debt has received uuiple .ullculjon I10111 Congress, al though your iue ml era hnve not nu t Willi the success hi nil purl iculars that might have been desh ed. Yet 011 lie n hole they huve heeu more euece.sful thati could hove been reasonably 1111- lieii'uied. Seven S tales which Massed ordinunces of sccessiou have been lully restored 10 llieir places iu ihe Luion. On the 8th Gcomia livid uu election, at which she latitied her Conslilu- 11011, re uuiciin iu lot in, elected a Governor, Uicml'cisof Cengiess, a State Legislature, aud ull oilier otliccis required. The Govcruor was (luh iusiulleil.auu ihe l.ighlaiure met and per loruud all the acts Ihen riqiied of Uiein by Ihe ccousiructiou acts ol tui'givss. euhseaueiillv. however, in violuliou of tlie t'onstituthiu which iney had jui rutilled, as since decided by the bupreuie Court, of Ihe State, they unseated Hie colurtd uicinbers of Ujc Legislature, and admit- tui 10 seats some uieuiners wlio are dlsquulihcd by the third ciuuce of Ihu 14ih Ameiiuinenl to ll'ie Consiitution, uu article which Ibcv them selves hud contributed to ratify. Under these clicuuisiunc.es I would submit to you, whether It would not be wise without delay to pass a law auihoiiziug the Governor ol Georgia to convene the members origiuu lly elected 10 the Legisla ture requiring each men her lo take Ibe oatli prescribed by ihe Reconstruction act.'aud uouu to be admitted who are lueligible under the third clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedmen under the protection which they have received, are making rapid progress Iu learning, and no complaints are nearq ot tlio lack of industry on their part when they receive fair remuneration for their labor. , . . ... : ., The me n provided fur paying Ihe Intel est on the public debt, with till other expenses of the Government, are more Minn ample x tie loss of our commerce Is the only result of tlie late rebellion which has not recelv d sufficient uu ten lion from you. To this suldect I cull your earnest attention. I will not now suggest plans by which this object may bectfictcd, but will. If necessary, make 11 Ibe subject of a special mes sage during the session of Congress, - At the March term Congress, by Joint resolu tion, authorized the Executive to older 1111 elec tion in the Slates of Virginia, Mississippi nnd Texas, and to submit to them the Constitution which each had previously ineonvetitlon framed, and losubpilt the Constitution either eutiie or Iu separate parts, to be voted on at the discretion ol the Executive. Under this authority eleclious were culled. In Virginia the election took place on the 6th of July, 1809. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor elected have been Installed. The Legislature met and did all required by this resolution and by all the Reconstruction acts of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful au thoiiiy. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives be admitted, nnd that the State be fully restomd lo Its place in the. family of Suites. ' Elections were culled iu Mississippi and Texas to commence on the 80th of November, 1809, nnd to last two dns In Mississippi and lour du.is in Texas. The elections huve taken place, but the result Is not Known. It is lo be hoped lhat the acts of the Legislatures of these Siutes when they meet will be such as to receive yonr appiobaliou aud thus close the work of lecoiisli'iietiou. ' Among the evils growing out oftbe rebellion and not vet referred to is that of an irredeema ble currency. It, Is an evil which I hop will receive your most earnest attention. It Is a duty, and one of the highest duties of the Gov. eminent, to secure 10 the citizens a medium of exchange of fixed, unvarying value. This im plied a return 10 a specie ba?ls, aud ho substi tute for it can be devised. It ehould be com menced now and readied at the earliest practica ble moment, consistent witli it fair regard to the lulcrest of the debtor Class. Immediate resump tion, if piactihle, would not be desirable.. It would compel Ihu debtor class to pay beyond their contract tlie premium on g ilu at the date of their purchase, uud would bring bankruptcy and ruiu to tnous mdsi Fluctuations, however, in the paper vuiuu o tins nun sure of all values ol gold Is ueli'liueiiiai 10 me iincrum 01 iruite. It 111. ikes the man of business an luvuluuiury guiubler, for In nil sales, when future .payment. is lo bemude, Hutu parties speculate us 10 wuui will be the vulue ot ihe ciinency to he paid uud received. I earnestly lecouimeud to ou, then. such leghlaiiou aswill insure a gradual return to sit eip ptiyuunis, nnd io pui an immediate slop 10 flucluul ion iu Iho vulue ot curreiiuy. The method 10 secure these results are a uumci'. ou us are the speculators on political economy. To. seen le Ihe Inner I see but ouu wuy, nnd that la lo authorize the treasury lo. redeem its owu paper at a lixed pike whenever picscuted j to Hill. hold Iroiu ciiculullou ull such cuirency re deemed uulil sold again liv gold. - The- vast lesources of : Ihu' nation, both developed and uiidi velopid, ought lo make our credit the best on eurtli. W ith less buideiiof luxutlon than the cliizcii bus endured fur six cai pus l, tlie euilro pul. lie debt could be pnid In leu years.

Hie public debt is represented iu great part by bonds huving troiu live to twenty, and bom tcu to fiitv yeuis.to mn, bearing iuierust ut the rale of 6 per ceiil.'and live per eeul.respecilvely. it is opilouul with the Government to pay ihuse bonds utuuy pelod alter the expiruliou of thu lust time uieutioued upon their luce.

It Is believed thai alt wujcu urd now dup ui y be re placed bv bonds bearing a rale of iuierust njl exceeding ilA per cent., and us rapidly as the lemuinUur ciesdue, aud lhey uiuy lie replaced iu the same uuy. .

Of a general revision of the laws reflating this subject, I recommend the poslponment for the present. I also suggest Iho renewal of the tox on Incomes, but at a reduced rate, rav of three per cent., and this tax to expire In three yeara. With the funding of the national debt as here suggested, I feel safe in saving the taxes and revenue from Imports mav be reduced safely tiotn sixty to eighty million's per annum at once, and still further reduced from year to year as the resources of the country are'devel oped. The report of the Secretary of Treasury shows the reot lpU of Government for the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1809. to be t370.IH8.747, and the expenditures, Including interest, boun ties, dfc , to, be t32L49"),&a7. The estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable 10 the Government, and will.no doubt, show a large decrease of the public debt. The receipts in the treasury, beyond the expendl. tures, have exceeded the amount necessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund, as pro vided by law. To lock np the surplus in the Treasury, and withhold it from circulation, would lead to such contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the pros perity of the country. Under these circumstan ces the Secictnry of the Treasury and myself heartily concurred in the propriety of using all the surplus currency In the Treasury In Ihepnr chase of Government bunds, thus reducing the interest bearing debt of the country, aud sub mitting lo Congiess the question of Ihedlspoal lion to be made of the bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasury amount to about (7.1,000,0(10. including those belonging to Ihe Sinking Fund. I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the Sinking Fund. Your atten Ion Is respectfully Invltisd to the recommendation of th Secretary of the Treasury for the creation of the officer of Com nilsslonbr of customs Revenue, for the Increase of salary to certain clnssesof officials, and the substitution of increased National Bank circula tion lo replace Ihe outstanding three per cent, certificates, and most especially to bis recom mendation Tor the rcpinlof lawsollowlng shares of tinea," penalties, forfeitures, &c, to Officers of the Government. It lulls but little. If auy.short of a Cabinet position in lis importance and re sponsibilities. I would ask lor it. therefore, such legislation as in your Judgment 'vlll place the cilice on a fooling of dignity commensurate with its importance, and with the charuclcr and qualifications of the clues of men required to fill it properly. As the United Suites Is the freest of all na tions, so too its people sympathize with all peo ple struggling for liberty and self-government, but while so sympathizing it is due to our honor 1 hnl we should abstain fiom enforcing our views upon unwilling nations, aud from taking' an Interested part without invita tion iu the quarrels between different nations or between Governments and their subjects. Our couise should alwaj'S he In conformity with stiict Justice and luw, internntioual und locul. Such has been the policy of the administration in dealing with these questions for more Uiuu a year. A valuable province of Spain and a near neighbor of ours, in which all our people cuu not bnflotla deep Interest, has been struggling for independence and freedom. The people and Government of the Uuited States entertain the same warm feelings and sympathies for the peo ple of Cuba in their pending struggles that they manifested throughout the previous struggles between spuin and bcr former colonies In behulf of Ihe latter. But the contest at no time as sumed the conditions which amount to a-wnr in the senseof International law, or which would show the existence of a deac'o political organ ization of the Insurgents sudlelent to Justify a reeoguitlou ol belligerency. The principle is maintained, however, lhat this nation is its own jmige wneu to accord tlie rights of belligerency I uituer 10 people struggling 10 tree themselves from a Government they believe to be oppress- 1 ive, or 10 jiiuepenuent nations at war wlili each other. Ihe United Suites have no disposition to iuterl'eie with the existing relation of Spain to her colonial po.-sessioua on this Continent. They believe that in duo time Spain and other European powers wil 1 Una their interest In ter minal iug th' sc relul ions und establishing their preseut dependencies as independent powers, members of the family of nations. The depend encies iue no longer regarded as subjects of transfer from one turopeau power to another. Wheu Ihe present relations of colonies ccusa. they uie to become Independent powers, exer cising the right of choice and of self-control in me ueiuimiiiuiion ot meir lulure coudltiou and ruiutiuus with other powers. : The United States,' in order to nut a stop to bloodshed In Cuba and In the interest of a neighboring people propoied their good offices tii bring the existing contest to a term mutton. Tlie oiler not being accepted by Spain on a basis whlcti we believed count ue received ny Cuba, was withdrawn. It is hoped that the good of fices of tlio United States mav yet prove advan tageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife. Meanwhile, a number or illegal expeditions ngafustCuba have been broken up. It has been the endeavor of thd Administration to execute the neutrality laws In good faith, no matter how unpleasant the task Is made by the suffering we have endured irotn lac It ot line good laitn 10 wiiru ns hv other nations. The United Stales schoaner Lizzie Major was arrested 011 the high seas, by a Spanish lrigaie. and two passengers taken Irom It una cuirltd as pusoncrs to luoa. lteiivesctitutloiia of lliese tacts were made to the Spuulsb Qoverumuitas soon as official Informa tion ol them icnclied wasnmgton. ine two passengers were set at liberty, und the Spanish Government assured the United States that the Captain of the frigate, in making the capture, hud acted without luw; that lie bud been repri manded lor the Irregularity of his conduct, and that tlie Spanish autlioiities Iu Cuba would not sanction auy net that could vio late the light, or treat Willi disrespect ilia sovereignty 01 tue na tion. The otiesilon of the seizure of the brig Mary Lnu'i'll 111. oiia ui the Biihaiiiu Islunds. hv tlirt Spanish authorities.

The conduct of ihe war between the allies and the Republic of Paraguay has made the Inter course with that country so difficult that it lias been deemed advisable lo withdraw our repre sentative from there. Toward the close of the last administration, a convention was signed at London for the set tlement of al) outstanding claims between Great Brilnlnand the United States, which failed to receive the advice and eonsent of the Senate to Its latlflcnllon. The time and the circumstances attending the negotiation of the treatv were fa. vorable to Its acceptance by the people of the United States, and Its provisions were wholly Inadequate for tlie settlement of the grave wrongs that had been sustolued bv thia Govern ment as well as by Its citizens. The injuries re sulting to the Uuited States by reason of the course adopted by Great Brl tain daring our late civil war, in increased rates of insurance, in the dimlnualinn of exports nnd imports, and other obstructions to domestic industry and produc tion j In lis efTect upon the foreign commerce of the country ; In Ihe decrease and transfer to Great Britain of our Commercial marine ; In the increased cost, both In treasore and in lives, of its suppress ion, could not be Adjusted and satis fled as ordinary commercial claims which con tinually arise lelween commercial dm lions, and yet Ihe convention erected Ihein slmplr as such oidinary claims from which they differ more widely in the gravity of their character than in the nmgultudc of their amount. Great even as is lhat difference not a word was lonnd in the treaty and not an inference could he drawn tor it and remove the sen.e of unfriendliness of the course of Great Britain in ouratrutrgle for exist ence which hnd so deeply and universally im pressed Hsclf on the people of th is country, believing that a convention thus misconceived In Its scope and made quite in Its previsions would not Jitive produced the hearty, cordial settlement of pending questions, which aloue is consistent with tlie relations which I desire to have estublished betweeiithe United Slates and Great Britain. 1 regarded the action of the Sen ate In rejecting the treaty lo have been wisely taken iu the interest of peace and as a necessa ry step In the direction of a perfect nnd cordial li iendshlp between the twocountrles. Sensitive people, conscious of their power, are more at euse under a great wrong. wholly unaioned.tlian under the restraint of a settlement which satis fies neither their Ideas of justice nor their grave sense ot the grievance they have susUiued. The rejection of the tieaty was followed by a state of public feeling, ou both sides, which' I thought uot favorable to an immediate attempt ut re uewed negotiations. I. accordingly so Instructed the Minister of the United States to Greut Brit ain, uud found that my views in this retard were shared by Her Majesty's Ministers. I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two Govern ments can upproach the solution of this mo mcuious question, with an assurance of what is due lo the righls,.dignity and honor of each, and with the detenu inatiou not only lo remove the causes of complaint in the past, but lo lay the loundution of u broad principle of public luw which will prevtut future differences uud teed to firm and continued peace and friendship. This Is now thu only grave question which, the Culled Slates have with foreign natious. The question of a treaty for reciprocity between the United Slates and the British Provinces on this continent has not been favor ably considered by the administration ; the advantage of such a treaty would be wholly in favor of the British producer, except possibly a few engaged iu the Hade between the two sectious. No citizen uf the United States would lie benefitted by recip rocity. Our internal taxation would "prove a protection (o Ihe British producer almost equal to tlie pioicction w hich our manufacturers now receive H oin me tsrin. Borne arrnogemcni, however, for the regulation of commercial in tercourse between Ihe Uuited States und the Uu. minion ot Canada may 'be desirable. The com mission tor adjusting, me Hudson nay and Puecl's bound Agricultural company upou tue United Stales, bus terminated its lubor. The award of six hundred aud tilty thousand dollars bus been made, and all rights nnd titles of the company in the territory of tlie United Stall's nave been exuugursuea. feeds lormi p.operw of the company Uuve been received. An appro priation by Congress to meet tins sum Is asked, The Comuirsslcners for determining the Noilli-wejiern laud boundary between the United Stales aud the British possessions, under in.) treaty of ISM. have completed their labors. and the Commission hss been dissolved. In conformity with the recommendation of Con. gress. a proposition was early made to the brillsu buveriiuieuiiuuuuiisii m mixea courts. cieuled under the treaty of April 1. 1802, lor the suppression of ine slave Irude. The subject Is still under negotiation. It haviug come to mv knowledge that cor porate company, organized under British laws, proposed to laud upon the shores of the Uuited States, aud to i.peiuie uere, a sunniurlue cmie, under a concession from bis Majesty ihu Em peror of the French, an exclusive right for twenty years of telegraphic communication be tween the shores of trance and the United Suites, with the very objectionable fuatuie of subject ing all messages conveyed thereby to the sov- eieiguty auo ine coutrol 01 the French Govern uieul, aud caused the French aud British lega tions at Washington to be made acquainted with me prouauiu poncy 01 iougrcs ou tue subject, as foreshadowed by the bill which Passed tht Senate iu March last.

In cousldcrution of this ugreeiuuiit, I diode I the withdrawal of all opposition bv tlie Newfound. luud authorities to the landing of the cable, and to the workiugoi 11, until the meeting or Con gress. 1 regret to say that there bus been no moiiincaiioii ujaue 111 me tompnnv s concessions nor, to ii.r ss 1 tau leiini, they huve attempted to secure one.

Our manufactures are Increasing with wonderful rapidity, under the encotiraifcrnent which tbey now receive.

The extension of rullroads In Europe and the East Is bringing In to competition with our agricultural products like products of other countries. Self-interest if uot self-prefervation, therefore, dictates can. tiou against disturbing any industrial interests of the country. It teaches ns also the neceesitv of looking to other markets lor the sale of our surplus, uur neignoors souui 01 tne Lulled States, and Ch ina und Jupan, should receive our special Attention. It will be the endeavor of Ihe administration to cultivate such relations with all theie nations as to entitle us to their confi dence, and make it their interest as well as ours to estoblisn better commercial relations. Through the agency of a more enlightenedpoU icy lhan lhat heretofore pursued toward China, largely due to the sagacity and ttloris of one of our own distinguished citizens, the weald is about 10 commence largely Increased iclniious with that populous and hitheito exclusive na tion. As the United Slates have leken the In itiatory in the new policy, so lhey should be the most correct in showing ihcir good faith in mak ing it a fucccss. In this connection I must ad vise such legislation as niil forever preclude the enslavement of Chinese upon our soil under the naaiu of cool ;cs, and also prevent Americau ves. sets Irom engaging in the transportation ot cool ies to any country tolerating the as stem. I also recommend that the mission to China he raised to one of the Hist claBS. On mv spuming the iefpt..r.s!bililles of the Chief Magistracy of the United 8 tales it was with Ihe onviction that three things were es sential to the peaee, prosperiiy'and fullest devel opment of the country. First among these is strict integrity in fulfilling- all our obligations: second, to secure protection lo the person and property 01 me citizens or our common country, wbeiever they may choose to move, without ref erence to original nationality, roJigloo,oiar or politics, demanding ol In 111 onlv obedience to the laws, and proper respect for the rights of others. Third, the union ol all the States, with equal rights, indestructible, hy any unconstitu tional means, lo secure the Bret or these. Cou- gresshas taken two essential steps: First, in de claring byjoir t resolution that the public debt should! be paid, principal and interest, in coin; za, by providing means lor psying. rrovldlug the menus, However, could not secure the ob ject desired without a proper administration til the laws lor the collection 01 revenues and an economical disbursement of them. To this sub. ject the udiniuisiration has most earnestly ad dressed Ilseit, with results, as 1 believe, eatlsfae. lurr vu iue country, mere uus ueen no Hesita tion in cnunging otneiuls Iu-order to secure the efficieut execution of the laws; sometimes, too. where, in a mere party view, uudcsirable polit ical results were likely to follow from anv hea Ration iu sustaining efficient officials agui'ust re monstrances wholly political. . It may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise Irom leaving on tlie statute books the so called tenure of office acts and to earnestly re coinuieud their total repeal. It could not. have been the intention of the framers of the Consti tution when providing that apilointments made by the President shou Id receive the consent of the Senate, that the latter should have the pow er to retain ln'office persons placed there by Fed eral appointments against the will of the Pres ident. The law is Inconsistent with a faithful and efficieut administration of the Government. Whutluiih con the Executive put in officials forced upon him, and these too w horn he has suspended lor reasons ? Jfow will such officials be likely to serve an administration which th"v know does not uost them ? For the' second re quisite lo our growth and prosperity, time and a 11 rm but humane administration of 'existing laws amended from time to time as they may prove ineffective, or prove harsh and unnecessary, are probably ull that arit required. The third can not be attained by special legis lation, but must be regarded as fixed by the Cu slitutioti Itself, uud gradually acquiesced in bv the force of public opinion froiu the fojundalion of the Government to the present. The management of the original Inhabitants of this continent, the Indians, bus been a subject of embariassment and expense, and has been at tended with continuous robberies, murders aud wars. From my own experience upon the fron tiers and iu Indian countries, I do not hold the conduct of the whites who come most in contact with Indians blameless for those hostilities. The past, however, cannot be undone, and Ibe qnes tion must he met us we now find it. I have at tempted a new policy toward the wards of the nutioii. They etinnot be regarded In any other light lhan as wolds. With Inir n soils so far as tried, and which I hope will be attended ulti mately with great tuccess. The Society of Friti. ds is well known as having succeeded lu living In peace with the Iudians In the early BeliUnieni of Pennsylvania, while their while neighbors of other sectious were constantly em bioikd. They are also known for their oppnai. liou to nil strife, violence and war, and are gen erally noted (or their strict integrity and inir dealings. These considerations iuduced me to give ihe nmiiogement of a few reservations of 1 nd ions to tht m. ai.d to throw the burdcu o Se lection ol agents upon the society itself. The result has proved most satisfactory. It will be fouud n oiefu.ly set forth In the report of the Commlfsloi er of Indian Affairs. For superin tendents and agents not on reservations, officers oftbe nimy were elected. The reasous for this are nun crous. ' When Indian agents are sent there or near there, troops mnst be sent also; the agent and the commander of troops are inde pendent of each other, and are subject to orders Irom dltlertnt departments of the Government. The ai my officer holds a position for life, the agent one al the will of the Piesident: the for uier Is (ersonally interested In living in harmo-' ny witii Indians nrd In the establishment of a pirn am ut place, lo the end that some portlpn of his liiemuy be spent within the limits of a clvillztd section. Tlie Inner has no such per ti.in.l interest. Another reason Is an economic oik ; and still nnoihe-r. Ihe hold which the Gov. einuient has upon a life 1 fficer to secure a faith f ul dinhnrge of his duties in earning out a given policy. The building of railroads and the access thcre by given lo all agricultural and mineral regions ot their country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of ludisns. No matter what ought lo be tbe re hiiionsbttwem such settlements and the Abor igines, tlie fact is they do not harmonise well, and one or the ether has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extermination of a race is loo horrible tors nation to adopt with out entailing Son itself the wrath ol all Chris tendom, and engendering in tbe citizens a dis regard lor human life and tbe rights of others dangerous to society. I see no substitute for such asvstem except In placing all the luiaus ou lut gc reservations as rapidly as euu be done, Blid giving tuem aosoiute piutectruu mere, ai soou as Uiev are fitted for il they should be In duced to take their lands In severally, and to set up Territorial Governments tor their own . . .
