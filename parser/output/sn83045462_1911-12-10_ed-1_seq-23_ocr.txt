Both these statements were made after the ; close of the stock market, so that they i Were without influence on speculation. The course of prices was irregular.

Forecasts of the statements pointed tv an increase of less than half the amount actually recorded. The fact that the gain was the largest since June of last year j supported the belief that a definite bet- j terment of conditions in the steel and iron j trades was at hand. Yesterday's unexpectedly good showing Of figures for the copper trade led to further buying of the copper stocks, which maintained good gains during the per.od of weakness at the end of the day's trading. Liondon was a large buyer of copper stocks here. '1 ne addition of more than $10,000,000 to the banks surplus reserve, as shown in the actual statement, materially improved the posit.on of'the batiks, which last week reported a surplus of only Money Flowing Back. The largo changes revealed in today's Statement reflected a readjustment of the position of the banks after meeting the December 1 requirements. Whe.ea?s the cash last week was $20,000,000 more than was expected, the banks gained nearjy |2,u00,000 this week, instead of loting J4,000,000, as had been estimated. The Ohange indicated the return of money temporarily withdrawn, much of It for Canadian banks. Further evidence of the pnusual shifting of credits was found in the loan decrease of $4o,00o,0uu and the accompanying shrinkage in <Jei>osits of |38,0UO,000. Bonds were firm, aside from renewed weakness in Allie-Chalmers 5s. Total sales par value $1,4t?l,0u0.

A sensational advance of 34* to at Buenos Aires, alleged to have been caused by far-reaching storm damage to wheat, led to a general covering here today on the part j of shorts. The close was nervous and H to Vha.% higher than last night. Other leading staples all showed a net decline? torn, to V*; oats, to vga's, and provisions, 2Via*> to h2Vj. Liverpool shorts, as well as local ones. A cre active here on the buying side of: wheat. Nevertheless, the development of' ?nv remarkable strength in Chicago was becked, and at times entirely overcome, is a result of the s owness of northwestrn markets to respond to the news from douth America. Winnipeg, which should je legitimately much more affected as a ompetitor with the Argentine in the export trade, did not advance to anywhere near so great an extent as unica-o. Attn- , neapolis was wtak throughout. The large] receipts northwest furnished the key as! to why Winnipeg dispatches told of the! Ially arrival of the three top grades in j amounts more than equal to the entire j -eeefpts of all sorts a year ago. It was his condition which in the main led to iberal selling on resting orders whenever one of the frequent rallies in the market iere took place. The outcome was to leave sentiment in a decidely unsettled state when the last gong cleared the pit. Between the opening and the close May fluctuated from to 98a'j6*4> with rinal sales '712, a gain of net.

XEW YORK, December 9,?The cotton market was steadier today on covering' by yesterday's sellers or realizing by older shorts for over the government's estimate of the crop, which Is due Monday, and the close was steady, at an advance of la5 points. The market opened steady at a decline of 1 point on January, but generally 2 to 6 points higher in sympathy with better cables than expected, and as result of covering, Inspired both by the relative firmness of IJverpool and bullish week-end figures. The south was a seller on the initial advance, and at times local bears were quite aggressive, but after working off to about the closing figures of last night during the middle of the morning the market steadied up again on continued covering, and at one time showed a net advance of 4 or 5 points on the active positions. Closing prices were within 2 or 3 points of the top. Private cables attributed the relatively firm showing of Liverpool to heavy continental buying and reports of a V. , A 4 A J - 1 a Y ? * - ?. n'UVl ucner naue in iMiuiuicstri, n mi iuc action of the market also suggesting that the ginning report of yesterday had failed to materially alter the average foreign view of the j>robable crop. Aside from the cables and the week-end figures, there seemed to be nothing in the news to help the market, and many reports continued to rome in j from the south Indicating continued activity in the matter of ginning, and also much cotton remaining in the fields to be picked. Houses with foreign connections were moderate buyers here again this morning. According to the figures of the New York Cotton Exchange, spinners' takings of American cotton for the past week were 4:17.456 bales, against 33:1,350 for the same week last year, and the increase in the ; visible supply of American cotton was 208,659, against 225,848 last year. NEW ORLEANS. NEW ORLEANS, December 0.?Cotton futures opened steady, at an advance of 2 to 4 points on good cables. The close was steady, unchanged to 3 points up. The weather map was called unfavorable, as too much rain was reported in the central and eastern sections of the cotton region. This led to some buying on the theory that picking, and, therefore, ginning, was being Interfered with. Sellers of yesterday were inclined to take profits, which furnished a moderate demand immediately after the call, when the trading months were 4 to 8 points up. Liquidation of the long account started here and the market did not hold. At the end of the first half hour of business prices were 1 to 3 points over yesterday's final quotation. From the middle of the morning on extreme dullness ruled. Commission houses had a few buying orders to fill, and these steadied the market. The most active months stood still at vesterdav's closing level for some time. Several large crop estimates from crop bureaus and private sources made their appearance, hut did not cause any selling of consequence. The forecast of unsettled weather and rain in the cotton region over Sunday brought out a limited amount of buying. Spot cotton quiet, unchanged. Middling, 9 3-16. Sales on the spot, 52 bales; to arrive. 1,900. Cotton futures closed steady. December, 8.82: January, 8.78; March, 8.83; May, 8.92; July, 9.04: August, 9.01; October, 8.95. The net results of the week's trading in the cotton market was a decline of 1 to 2 points. The high prices of the week were madie Thursday and the low prices Friday. Following the census report on ginning Friday there was a drop of a quarter of a cent. At the highest the trading months were 22 to 24 points over last week's close; at the lowest they were 2 to 5 points under. The range of prices was 25 to 28 points. During the week up to Friday the market was supported by the covering of shorts. Friday the market appeared to be in a weak position, technically, and the census report on ginning of 12,814,832 bales up to December 1 was bearish enough to cause considerable selling which the market was in no position to stand as bulls offered no support whatever. Outside of the covering by shorts and the report on ginning the week was featured only by large crop estimates from private sources. The weekly statement showed a large into sight and also a large out of sight and. therefore, the figures about balanced. Attention was called by the bears to the fact that the visible supply is now 4,230,743 bales, against 3,766,263 a year ago, and 3,797,579 two' years ago. Bullish circular writers made particular mention of the fact that spinners' takings for the season amount to 4,300,000 bales, against 3,785,000 a year ago, and 3,843,000 two years ago. In the spot market prices closed unchanged, compared with last week, middling being quoted at 9 3-16. A year ago middling was quoted at 147^. Sales on the spot amounted to 4,623 hales, against 3,227 last week, and 5,105 this week last year; e>a!es to arrive amounted to 13,060 bales, against 9,075 last week, and 7,730 this week last year.

FOREIGN MARKETS. LONDON, December 9.?Money and discount rates were firm today. The stock market was quietly steady with bear covering the chief influence in making home rails, Kaffirs and Mexican rails fractionally dearer. Copper shares advanced on favorable American statistics. Realizing caused a loss of 3-16 In consols. American securities opened steady and around parity, iviter the market advanced under the lead of Canadian Pacific and Amalgamated Copper. The closing was steady with prices from l<6 to 1V2 points higher than yesterday's New York closing. After a generally quiet week the stock market closed today with lr mh. ? u 1; . i rtrguiai ciioii^rts m |?i n-i-n. i uu |iuune is still holding off. and, with dealers J not inclined to extend their commit| ments In view of the political uncerj tainty and dearer money, a sagging i tendency appeared early, which was accentuated later by actual and prospective new issues of securities amounting to $60,000,000. Gilt-edged securities and foreign bonds were the most afTected, consols losing :\i of a point. Home rails, however, partly recovered at the end of the week on the belief that the troubles between railroads and the trainmen will be satisfactorily adjusted. Argentine ra'Is attracted Investors, but Japanese bonds suffered from realizing. President Taft's message had little effect in the American section, where stocks started well, but dear money rates and the Wabash reorganization plan later depressed values from 1 to 4 points. Today, however, the market developed a steadier tone on covering and the favorable monthly statistics of the Copper Producers' Association. The stringency prevailing in the money market forced^ discounts to the bank rate ler?l. ano were I8 u? prosiieci ui easier conditions at present.

Summary of state banks and trust companies in Greater New York not reporting to the New York clearing house: Loans, $620,528,000, increase, $10,611,000; specie. $65,882,800. Increase, $2,467,300: legal tenders, $11,206,000, Increase, $366,200; total deposits, $682,881,400. increase, $1,273,100. The Financier will say: "By a drastic contraction of $45,853,000 in loans, which operated to reduce deposits by $38,281,000, the clearing house banks of New York succeeded this week in largely building up their depleted surplus reserve, the increase In this item for the six days ending Saturday having been, according to the statement of actual condition, $10,387,350, making the total reserve above the 25 per cent minimum $11,096,250. The main interest in the statement centered around the item of cash. Preliminary estimates foreshadowed a further loss of six or eight million dollars In specte and legals, on account of known operations, but the statement Showed an actual gain of $1,749,000 instead of the decrease expected. Just how the banks have succeeded within two weeks in reducing their loan commitments by $71,000,000 Is rather difficult to explain. The transfers have not been to trust companies, since these institutions have reported only normal changes In loans and other items. It Is rather noteworthy that the state banks and. trust companies In greater New York which do not report to the clearing house have shown an increase In their loan item in two weeks amounting to $1S,000,000. Taken as a whole the bank statement was a very strong one and shows that the money market will probably be subject to no stringency worthy the name." NEW YORK PRODUCE.

WASHINGTON SCARE IS ON Speculative World Always Gets the Shivers When Congress Convenes. Talking About Hard Times. BY H. ATiTIOWAY. NEW YORK, December 9.?Wall street has become synonymous of stagnation. What goes on day by day amounts to so little as to be worthy of almost no comment. This is not different, however, from what has been for some time past expected by Independent students of the situation. In the financial world virtually every Interest has been waiting upon the outstart of Congress. President Taft has messaged upon the trusts; democratic leaders have aggressively forecasted a program which is essentially a plan of campaign calculated to disturb the equanimity of Wall street. To this extent the stock exchange has become informed that we have ahead of us, for months to come, a national legislative turmoil. Under such circumstances it is not strange that market activity should hesitate. In times past such circumstances would have been sufficient to precipitate wbolesalo liquidation and declines severe. Quiet But Heavy Selling. At present, though, there Is essential difference from what has been the rul ing potentiality hitherto. Aforetime, political grilling was ever sufficient to erect scarecrows not In Wall street only, but generally throughout the business world. Now the condition is diametrically composed to the old-tln^e fashion. One reason for this is clear enough?the reason that has to do with the fact that stock market conditions have for so long been so bad that the disclosure of any new uncomfortable factor can only have scant effect u/pon the depressive side already so much overworked. It Is declared by an employe of one of the greatest banking houses engaged in international transactions that for weeks and even months past his firm has been continually and largely selling out the stocks of customers whose Interests are of consequence enough to be carefully regarded. This "authority" Insists thai, during the month of November his house sold (quietly and anonymously) over $20,OUO.OOu of Investment securities which have till now been quietly reposing in safety deposit boxes. And he adds that not lees than $100,000,000 more are scheduled for sale. This sort of representation is sensational. The man who makes It has opportunities to know. They who at first hand receive it trust to the good faith of him who sponsors it. Poor-Times Talk Popular. Prom the viewpoint of traders who take their position and make their calculations upon what Is superficial there Is encouragement in presentations like the .foregoing?they who are inclined to be bears finding warrant for extreme pessimism. But at present It seems Co me that tills professional attitude can prove dangerous. So much poor-times talk passes current, so popular is it to recite or to hearken to what Is dismal, that they who stake their Wall street fortunes upon the blue side are not unlikely soon to find themselves handicapped by too much company. It never has been profitable a 2><UC IU DC11 

OIUCA9 OliUl L UJAlIi UCW p U1 calamities already known to everybody. Yet that is what Wall street bears rignt now are doing-. Business is slow. Collections are not quiet up to averages that are normal. But there is nothing fresh In this info.mat.ou. Quietude of trade?commercial and industrial alike?has prevailed since away bacfc at the start of the year. It is no sudden, surprising development To become aiatressed and disturbed and speculatively active on any such account is merely to be a confessed left-over. Reversal at Hand. No reason is discoverable for any change in the opinion hitherto expressed in this review?no excuse for any qualification of it?that with the turn of the year we are likely to have complete reversal in Wall street sentiment. By that time ?e will have scheduled long lists of political handicaps, tariff and trust laws, and all the other perfervld miscellanies will by Januiyy have been all hung out on the national clothesline, and while for a little they may flap around in congressional breezes their parade is not going to be at the end any more afflictive than seeming to be at the start. The worst Washington view is always the lirst Washington view. And it will be simply out of line with all precedent if when once the adverse things are known there does not come with promptness and wtih thoroughness a revu.sion on the side of sanity and bettering prices. Stock Market Division. In the list of conspicuous stock exchange issues there are many that Invito special reference and direct analysis, many whose fortunes seem to be at crucial points. But between this and new year time it would be hardly opportune to make discussion In any quarter specific. Somo rules are always rules Incontestable, rules that cannot be put aside. In the wholesome instance there is openness of accounting, fair dealing with the public, a proper maintenance and upbuilding of physical property. In the other there Is persistent mystery, the exploitation of a blind pool. Wall street's stock market can fairly be divided Into these two parts. And when, after awhile, something like assertive progressiveness begins we are undoubtedly going to have quotation exhibits whose inspiration and whose support will be closely keyed, to this that is fundamental. Business Improvement. Canvasses disclose some Improvement In the country's business conditions. The recognized commercial agencies say this much. Private and independent authorities are still more agreeable in their reports. Iron and steel show in their November returns a record better than for any month preceding for the year. Prices don't advance, but the volume of business expands materially, and more business, of course, means the opening of opportunity for larger profit. Tailing United States Steel for criterion, the industrial situation may be regarded as distinctly encouraging. Steel common's dividend is better earned at the end of the year than it was at the year's beginning. Yet the large opportunities for profit opening to stock market followers, whether investors or speculators, are offered by stocks selling away down at almost in significant figures. It is not a snort list. The stock exchange has a score of conspicuous properties ranging at bankruptcy prices. In perhaps half of these examples there are represented values which eventually will be found consderably superior to what current figures quote. | This is peculiarly a period for becoming prepared for a market entitled to harden and to broaden.
