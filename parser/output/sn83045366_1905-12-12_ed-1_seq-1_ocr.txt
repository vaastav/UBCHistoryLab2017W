SENATOR FORAKER OPENLY DEFIANT jjOhio Man Apparently Throws Aside All Concealment of Hostile Intent. Assails President's Rate Policy and Threatens Statehood People. SENATOR J. B. FOBAKEE, Wh I Out in the Open aa Opposed to ij Roosevelt. yjfournal Speolal Service. j, Washington, Dec. 12.Some people Shere are beginning to wonder whether Senator Foraker of Ohio intentionally 3 has set himself to the task of defying 'tho administration and the party man agement generally. He introduced resolutions in the sen ate yesterday and made a threat that unless they were adopted no statehood bill could be passed, the inference being that he himself would hold up any meas inre passed by the house, even if it should be adopted by the republican caucus in the senate. Gossips Are Aroused. i This fact, taken in, connection .with Ithe celebrated speech of Senator For laker in Ohio, in, which he took direct issue with the president on the railroad *ate question-, has given rise to anim imense amount of gossip at the capitol, ^Vrt a majority of the party but he had y. many republican assistants that noth Mng was thought of this fact. This year, vhowever, the Ohio senator has an tiounced his opposition to the two state hood bills and is quoted on authority as feaying that unless Arizona and New ^Mexico are separated entirely from the .^statehood proposition, and permitted to .Vote separateLv on the adoption of a itonstitution, he will not permit any leg nislation if he can prevent it -in the sen ate. Against Roosevelt. 9 At the same time Senator Foraker jumped into the arena with a persistent (attack on the railroad rate policy of the president. There was no necessity ftfor such a debate. The subject was not ^properly before the senate, but was omerely up incidentally owing to the ^introduction of a rate bill of his own fby Senator Tillman of South Carolina. Neither the pronuhciamento in regard *?to statehood nor the formal speech in lithe senate in opposition to the railroad irate bill, which never has been consid ered by the senate at all, was at all ^necessary at this time, so that this led $to the belief that Senator Foraker in a!tends to cross swords openly with the ^president and his administration. There uare all sorts of political gossip afloat in tthis connection, and it centers about fthe presidency atol the Ohio senatorial succession. Will Fight Rate Bills A noticeable thing was that Foraker was the open opponent of the legisla tion suggested so strongly by the presi jdent and soon to be passed by the (house, backed up by a nearly unanimous ^vote. Half a dozen southern*, senators took issue with the Ohio leader on ques tions of law and these same men mti I mated that they would, in the end, sup jlport the president, while Mr. Foraker ^announced that he proposed to fight orailroad rate legislation and that he bwould speak on it at much greater riength hereafter. it Se'nsator Foraker's term expires iMarch 30, 1909. This is a year after hthe next presidential election. The re fwtilt of the election in Ohio last month I^J^makes the state, for the time being at .^least, a doubtful one.

The lithe executive reception room at the younger republicans only rallied to the hite House. Senator Foraker's attitude on the atehood question was well defined dur ng the last congress. He did not act with a majority of the party, but he had BO many republican assistants that noth- be a Ohi man.or Fo this reaso the ^of Senator Foraker in opposition to the ^settled policy of the administration ^clearly laid down in the president's ^message is a good deal of a mystery. I Railroad-rate regulation was dis cussed at great length yesterday in the senate. It was viewed both from |the ground of necessity and constitu tionality. A large number of senators /were drawn into the debate, which fin Silly settled down into a technical argu ment between Senators Bailey and For aker on the right of a state legislature to delegate the ratemaking power to a Estate commission. The rate question was brought up by ^Senator Tillman, who explained a bill fhe introduced empowering the inter state commerce commission to fix a imaximum rate, to take effect within thirty days after the rate charged has been found unjust and unreasonable, this rate to remain operative until changed by the commission. His bill jamends the organic act of 1887 creating ^khe interstate commerce commission and ideals with but the one proposition of jfixing maximum rates.

HOSTILITY SHOWN. BY THE LEADERS Attack on President's Rate Policy Followed by Rebhff Canal Matters. in Lane's Nomination for Interstate Commerce Commissioner Is Held Up. Special to Tho Journal. Chicago? Dec. 12 Walter Wellman, in a Washington dispatch to the Record Herald, says: Friction between the Roosevelt ad ministration and the republican lead ers in the senate became more than ever apparent today. These two wings of the republican party in Washing ton seem to be drifting apart and no one can forecee the outcome. President Koosevelt is seriously dis satisfied because senators are holding up his nomination of Mr. Lane of Cali fornia' to be a member of the interstate commerce commission. The president knows he cannot force the senate to confirm a nomination, but he does think he and Mr. Lane are entitled to a vote and not to be kept hanging in midair. In administration circles the opposition to Lane is ascribed to railroad influence in the upper branch. Rate Question Up. On the floor of the senate yesterday afternoon the railroad-rate question was unexpected ly precipitated and there followed a most interesting debate, in the course of which the constitutional power of congress to delegate- the rate making power was seriously questioned by leading republican senators. All the indications are that when the senate lawyers get well into this legal and constitutional discussion it will go on for months. And finally, the senate by a vote of 40 to 23, decided to refer the Panama canal emergency appropriation bill to the committee oh appropriations instead of to the committee on interoceanic canalsgenerally considered a rebuff to the administration. Prominent republican senators openly criticised alleged extravagance in canal management and insisted upon having all employment under the commission taken out of the hands of President Roosevelt and fixed by law. Veterans aa Opponents. It was noteworthy that among the ten republicans who voted on what is generally regarded as the administra^ tion side of the opposition, not more than one or two could be classed among the leaders of'the.'body. The old guard, the veterans, the men of commanding influence and position, were almost support of the administration. This question of the committee to which the canal should go is not of much importance. Were it not for the manifest spirit of half-veiled opposition to the administration that crept into the discussion, little notice would have been taken or the matter, but consid erable feeling developed and the young er republicans, who are more friendly to the prv. ident than the old men, prob ably because they are closer in touch with the people, tried to stem the tide.

Rocke feller has left this city and gone south to evade subpena-servers. A friend of the family is authority for this state ment. The subpena-servers have been after the oil king to try to haye him testi fy before a special commission in this city in the case of the state of Mis souri against the Standard Oil compa ny and its allied companies. This case is designed to prevent the Standard Oil company from doing business in Missouri. The examination, originally set for Dec. 4, has been postponed un til Jan. 5, when it is expected that Henry H. Rogers will testify. Mr. Eogers, one of the subpena servers has made affidavit, was served in his automobile, the subpena and the $2.50 witness fee being thrown thru the vehicle's window upon his lap. Altho subpena-servers have been af ter twenty-one high Standard Oil men, Mr. Rogers is the only one on whom service has as yet been made. The wife of Mr. Rockefeller did not accompany him south. Neither did his son, John D., Jr. Mrs. Rockefeller is in this city and young Mr. Rockefeller is circulating between this city and Pocantico Hills. It was reported in Wall street that the elder Rockefeller and Daniel C'Day are now at Hot Springs, Va., where the former has been playing golf.

COSSACKS TURN AGAINST CZAfe Seed of Revolt Finds Root Where Emperor's Hopes Are Centered. Butchery of Jews Is Resumed in a Russian City by Mobs. Vienna, Dec. 12.A dispatch to the Neue Freie Presse from Bucharest, Ru mania, says: "Reports received here thru refu gees declare that since Sunday the toyrn of Elizabethgrad, Russia, has been burning and that a mob has been kill ing and plundering in the Jewish quar ter. A regiment is proceeding to Eliza bethgrad and Kishineff tQ restore or der there." St. Petersburg, Monday, Dec. 11 (Morning), via Eydtkuhnen, East Prussia, Dec. 12.The sentiment of the workmen's delegates, which,is ex-r tremely depressed, has been somewhat raised by the receipt of a dispatch from Moscow claiming that the revolution: ary propaganda nas finally taken-root among the' Cossacks, the last hope of the reaction. The third squadron of the First regiment of Don Cossacks is reported to have held a meeting and to have drawn up service demands claim ing that the men are fed like dogs and shabbily clothed. The government officials were forced to deprive the sol diers, of their rifles and lances. This is the first sign of disaffection on the part of the Cossacks. No Oteneral Strike Yet, Caution having prevailed over the fury aroused by the arrest of the strike leaders, the workmen's council has re jected the proposition to order a gen eral strike at present, as untimely, and has decided that the workmen should bide their time patiently until all the preparations are complete. The coun cil recognized the weakness and unpre paredhess of the workmen for a gen eral conflict, and had been informed that the railroad men had already de cided against a strike. The remnants of the laborY and so cialist delegates held, a secret meeting in the hall of the ecotoomic society at an early hour this, morning, declined to ac cept the challenge of the government, and adopted a resolution' against the arrest of M. Krustaleff, the president of the executive committee of the work men's council, and the other St. Peters burg leaders, which it was pointed out was onl^ of local importance and did not furnish cause for a general strike. The resolution, however, declared that it was the sacred duty of all workmen to carry On the work begun by the ar rested leaders of equipping and prepar ing the fighting legions of workmen for an armed upmsing adding: "In the name- of the future-proletariat we re fuse to make any active protest at pres- ent." Triumvirate Rules. A triumvirate hereafter will guide the workmen's council. The govern ment on Saturday arrested the most brainy men of the organization and the remaining delegates not having suf ficient confidence in any of their, num ber, chose an executive committee of three to guide the policy of the council until events bring forth a worthy suc cessor of M. Krustaleff. The post and telegraph situation is steadily ameliorating, tho no wires are working to points outside of Russia, and telegraphic communication with the interior is very faulty. Many of the striking opemtors have lost heart owing to the news from Moscow that the leaders, when arrested, were indulging in an expensive supper at a popular Moscow restaurant in company with women strikers and spending the strike Continued on 2d Page, 5th Column.

Officers Cited to Give Reasons Against a Five Million Dollar .Valuation. The first legal step to reach the in tangible property of foreign corpora tions for taxation in Minnesota was made today. A. Hoffman, county auditor of Dakota county, issued an order to the Minnesota officers of Swift & Co., at South St. Paul, calling on them to show cause why their assess ment should hot be raised from $394,- 012 to $5,000,000. The order is returnable Saturday, when the packing company's attorneys will doubtless appear and deny the an? thority of the state to tax anything beyond the taxable property of the company. The move is an outcome of i he reso lution drawn by Attorney General Young and passed by the state boaTd of equalization in September, recom mending that the -proper county audit ors list as omitted property the fran chises and "union, in use" value of foreign corporations doing business, in the state. It means the beginning of a contest to reach all such companies for taxation. A test case will be made of Swift & Co. The paperB. were served by George T. Simpson, assistant attorney general, who, with County Attorney William Hodgson of Hastings, assisted Attorney General Young in their preparation. Based on Jaggard Decision. As a question of law, the state re lies on the opinion of Justice Jaggard in the Western Union case, which states plainly that the state has the right to tax the franchises of foreign cor porations doing business in this state, assessing them not only on the tan gible property, but on their ''union in use" value, or, in other words, accord ing to the volume of, business done in the state. When it comes to a question of fact, the attorney general has arrived at the valuation of the company in somewhat this manner. The purchase of live stock by Swift & Co. at South St. Paul in 1904 amounted to $12,000,000, from which it is figured that the volume of Minnesota business, including a percent age for profits, and added value due to expenses and charges of various kinds, comes to approximately $25,000,000. The total business the company last year was $200,000,000. Consequently one eighth of the company's capital must be employed in Minnesota. The present capital stock of the company is $35,- 000,000, and. there are bonds out to the value of $5,000,000, making $4.0,000,000 of capital invested in the company's property as a whole. The Minnesota proportion' would? be $5,00fr,000.* The company is now stssessea at South St. Paul to the amount of $177,112 for per sonal property, and. $216,900 for real estate, a total of $394,012. The differ ence between this total and $5,000,000 represents the alleged value of the in tangible assets of the company in Min nesota, franchise and "union in use" value. This difference. $4,605,000. if reduced to about pne-third, as other property is in Dakota county, would mean an increased, taxable value of a million and a half, which/would bring approximately $45,000 in taxes. About to "Out a Melon." The valuation put on the property is not thought to be excessive, as its net profits last year were $4,200,000, com pared with $3,240,000 the. year before, and on the strength of this increased profit the company now is.proposing to "cut a melon" by issuing $30,000,000 additional stock.

Owner of Equitable Life Is In duced by Pear o.f Jerome V.v stify Dryden Admits Prudential Gave Thousands to Campaign Funds. New York, Deo. 12.District Attor ney Jerome has brought Thomas Ryan to time. Jerome, who was asked by the insurance investigators to take steps to punish Ryan for refusing to answer^ questions about E. H. Harri man and the Equitable Life, told Ryan yesterday that he ought to answer. Coming from Jerome, such advice means no more and no less than notice that failure to answer would mean prosecution by Jerome. So Thomas F. Ryan, /who purchased the Hyde stock of the Equitable Life Assurance society, was fche first witness before the insurance investigating com mittee today. He said to Mr. Hughes, counsel for the committee, that he had meant no disrespect by his declination to toll what E.. H. Harriman had said to him at the time that Mr. Harriman sought to obtain a share in Mr. Ryan's purchase of the Hyde stock. What Harriman Said. "What did Mr. Harriman say to you afcout sharing the Hyde stock! asked Mr. Hughes. "Immediately after my purchase of the'stock," said Mr. Ryan, "Mr. Har riman called on me. We had several conversations. Mr. Harriman said that I should not have come into the situa tion without consulting him, and that I. ought to let him have an equal share In the Hyde stock. I declined: He objected to the trustees and wanted to name two of them. He said he did not think I could carry out my plan without his aid. I said I intended to divest myself of control of the Equitable and I re gretted very much to have his opposi tion, but I was going to carry out my plan whether I nad his opposition or not." The purchase of the Hyde stock, Ryan said, was made on Friday JuneMr. 9 Mr. Ryan first heard from Mr. Harri man on that day. Mr. Harriman, said the witness, suspected that he, Ryan, was in on the deal and had a talk with him on that day. Mr. Harriman saw him again^on the following Monday-or Tuesday in com pany with Elihu Root and Paul Orav.ath. Most' oif the things said were said at this second interview. Mr, Ryan told Mr.: Harriman who the trustee* were to be. Why Harriman Objected. Harriman then said that he had given much time to straighten out the Equit able. The witness said that Harriman gave no other reason than that for de manding a share in the purchase of the Hyde stock. ''For what reason did Mr. Harriman want half the stock?" asked Mr. Hughes.

BEEF TRUST CASE IN COURT AGAIN Garfield on Hand to Testify and Formal Trial of Packers Is Near. Chicago, Dec. 12.Attended by an imposing array of legal talent and Snary irowds of spectators, the last prelim to the formal trial of the beef trust fcases began here today before Judge J\ Otis Humphrey in the United States court. The issues were on ten' special pleas raised by the packers, which must be settled by a jury trial before action is taken on the indict ments returned by the federal grand \iury. John S. Miller, acting for the pack ers, demanded without qualification that the charges against Samuel A. McRob erts of Armour & Oo., one of the de fendants, be dismissed at once. Dis trict Attorney C. B. Morrison admitted that Mr. McRoberts had testified before the grand jury which returned the in dictments and Unally entered a nolle, dismissing the case against McRoberts. James/R. Garfield, commissioner of corporations, upon whose testimony -much of the government's case depends, was among those in the courtroom. He was subpenaed to tell what he did while investigating the beef industry, a#t whether under that investigation the present defendants were promised im munity in this case. Five witnesses from Mr. Garfield's department will be here tomorrow. Attorneys for the defendants de manded separate trialg. Mr. Morrison .objected. Mr. Miller spoke at length on the point and was finally interrupted by Judge Humphrey, who asked: "In the case of two postoffice bur glars, we would require them to stand trial together, would we not?" Yes, your honor," replied Mr. Miller. Finally it was agreed that the de fendants would stand trial together. LID IS ON

Journal Special Service. 1 3"* a New York, Dec. 12.-VThe Mutual Life.. insurance company has passed into the control of the Standard Oil crowd by an agreement to elect Charles A.' Pea body president of the company at Wednesday's meeting of the ooard of trustees. :f This makes the second of the "Big Three" that has passed into the hands of the Rockefeller-Morgan-Ryan com bination since the upheaval in the life insurance business. When the time is ripe for sweeping out the McCall crowd in the New Yorlc Life, it is expected that the same com bination, thru George W. Perkins, head of the Morgan forces in the board, and James Stilfinan, head of the Rockefel ler forces among the trustees, will ialsa swing, that company into the hands *of the great triumvirate. wa'* Fear of Hashes. "Aroused to fever pitch by the fear oN Charles E. Hughes' becoming presidentN of the Mutual Life, H. H. Rogers, head of the Standard Oil forces in the fight* turned loose his wardogs on the trns* tees of the company and pledged a big majority of them to vote for Mr. Pea body at Wednesday's meeting. He also won over a majority of the nominating committee appointed last Wednesday for the specific purpose of selecting a candidate to take the place of Frederick Cromwell, the temporary president. This committee is composed of Elbridge T. Gerry, James N. Jarvie, Dumont Clark, Stuyvesant Fish and William H. Truesdale, and it will rec ommend the appointment of Mr Pea-1 body. The accepetance of Charles A. Pea body was a bitter pill for many of the trustees. Tho they agreed to vote for him when the hardest kind of pressure. was put upon them, they fear his elec tion will prove an unwise move and detrimental to the interests of the Mu tual Life because of the Standard Oil, connection and the fact that he is the personal counsel of George F.

Lawson of Boston. The election of a man connected with the Standard Oil to the presidency, he admitted, was certain to arouse hostile feeling among the policyholders and give great impetus to the Lawson canti paign for proxies. While Lawson has been making great headway in the west and south in his hunt for proxies, the great centers of population have so far not responded* in any material degree to his call. But. with a Standard Oil man at the head of the Mutual, it is feared Lawson will make headway in those sections which have heretofore regarded him with suj picion.
