Will Seabrook Continues the Story of His Journay Through France, and His Impressions. (By W. B. Seabrook.) Special Herald and News. Arles, Provence.-"Seeing Prov ence, on Sixty Cents a Day" would make an appropriate title for the narrative of my last week's ramble. The necessities of life are cheap enough in northern France, but here the prices are astonishing. Many laborers support wife and family on $3 per week, while the beggars and gamins subsist without hardship, when necesary, on a daily "expense acenunt" of eight or ten cents. My actual experienees, coupled with re liable information regarding locali ties which I have not yet visited, have convinced me that an American who is willing to dispense with style and luxuries can live comfortably anywhere in Europe, with -the excep tion of Switzerland, on a daily ex penditure averaging from 50 to 75 e4nts, avoiding, of course, the tourist hotels and patronizing instead the places which cater exclusively to the humbler classes of the native popula tion-a method whish, after all, af fords the only real way to get ac quainted with the most pieturesque aid characteristic phases of Euro pean life. At Marseille I had no trouble in finding a clean and airy bed-room, at -the hotel du Soleil et des Alpes, 19 Rue des Recollettes, for twenty cents a day. The neighborhood was modest but thoroughly respectable, and in a .restaurant next door, patronized by prosperous workmen and petites bourgeoises, I dined for te nand fif teen cents, this figure not including -wine which costs an additional six cents per bottle. Approximately the sure prices prevail among establish anents ,of a similar class in smaller Provencal towns that I have visited. These iplaces are not frequented by tramps, peddlers or the "poor;" for them there are o6her restaurants, where they pay four or five cents for a bed, and two cents for a steaming bowl of soup or hash. The existence of such conditions is not generally known in- America, and is equally ig *nored by the average tra-eler, who lives in the grand hotels and devotes all his time to dinners, theatres, museums and art galleries, so I am offering these ,pra.ctieal data with the hope that other young Amit-ans who have long dreamed of visiting the old 'world, but who have been deterred by an exaggerated idea of the attend ant expenses may be induced to un dertake a like experience. When I set out from Marseille, the hills and fields, golden with autumn leaves and ripened harvests, were glowing in the warmth of Indian summer. The first day afoot, 1 erossed the' little mountain ridge be hind the bay, skirted t.he inland seas that form the eastern delta of the Rhone, and reached Martigues, a -fishing village whose fleets have sailed the Mediterranean for seven cen,turies, and whose boats are handed down from generation to generation. Aside from~ the fishermen, the popu lation is eomposed alnost exclusively of eats. The place is literally alive with~ them; they crowd the streets and overflow into the adjacent ditch es, prowling about by night and day, poneing with frenzied delight upon a ravishing landscape or an odorous fish carcass, a multicolored stuiset or a basket of decayed shrimp. Their life is one long, voluptuous feast. Henceforth, forever, my dream of Paradise will be something like the existence of the cats and painters of Martigues. Only, if I am accorded the privilege of dhoice. I will elect to be a cat, for I noticed that the felines were all sleek and fat, while the artists were gaunt and lean. After spendinz the nfight at Marti gues, I shouldered my knapsack, and with a chance com.mii'. -, w'r?d the rid plain af Crau, with Arles forty ' . The Cran ~is a &Cert e'nvered stonler and hvWdiere. uihabited barren of vegetation, a sort of sture Sahare that has reeint:'d tempts at irrigation and reclamau tion, except for arn oeasional oasis in the northern district. The road was long, the horizon was vast and mon- 1 otonous as the ocean and more than once before our pilgrimage was end ed, I sighed for a camel or an anto mobile. But, finally, one Saturday evening, we reached our goal; and on I Sunday afternoon I followed the en- t Itire able bodied population of Arles ( ito the ancient Roman ampitheatre, to s witness the final 'course de taureanx' f of the season, a kind of French ver- e sion of the Spanish bull-fight, not so t dangerous as the latter, but none the less exciting. and sometimes resulting a in bloodshed and fatality. A savage d bull, goaded into blind fury. is turned 1 loose in the aren3. with a red cockade S tied securely on his forehead. The. beneficent municipality offers a prize of a couple hundred francs to the ma tador, or "razetour" as he is termed in the patois, who succeeds in snatch- $ ing the trophy from its place between the horns of the infuriated animal. Thirty or forty young men, unarmed and clad as for a footrace, enter the irena and stake their. lives on the slender chance of gaining thirty or s forty dollars and a few moments ap- b plause. Truly a gentle and divertinz S pastime! But the grey old coliseum, - with its double row of massive arches 0 practically intact after twenty cen- 1 turies, interested me more than the I bull-baiting and the two or- three e thousand modern Arlesians, who, n despite their numbers, seemed abso- , lutely lost in the vast circular am- i I pitheatre, which historians say was fashioned to furnish seats for forty and fifty thousand spectators, for Ar I las was once the proudest city of the western world, an imperial metropolis, e the "Proveneale Roine." M The modern Arles is one of the a solemnest and. saddest spots I have i: ever visited. Nothing remains but p the broken, shattered skeleton of the a once splendid city. Formerly so ti I grand and powerful. celebrated for its e noble population, its commanding sit- f uation, its immense commercial aeti- g vity and its formidable prowess in o war; Arles, the ancient metropolis, t turn by turn, Greek Roman, Gothie, Saracen, the city of imperial councils, I the city of miracles, traditions and legends, is today a dead Proveneal village, built around a pile of crumb- r ng, mutilated stones. And yet, de- A spite the miseries and misfortunes which have followed it even unto the o 'end, despite t.he wars and political c ospiracies which consummated its a: ruin, or perhaps because of these ea- i lamities, it will be forever the ren dezvous of poets and the inspiration i of artists.f JUG OF CORIN LIQUOR LOST.C t One Sent Last Week by Major Micah a IJankinsto White House not F I Received.

Fnion Man Who is Charged With Murdering His Wife Before the Supreme Court. Columbia, Dec. 16.-The first ques ion taken up before the supreme ourt today in the complicated case f W. T. Jones, charged with the ie murder of his wife, was the ap eal by the State from the order of hief Justice Pope, staying the trial f Jones at Union pending the appeal rom the order of Judge Hydrick de ying hail to Jones. The court de ided that the order of the chief jus Lee was erroneous and that it should e reversed. Chief Justice Pope of urse did not sit during the argu ent of this appeal from his own or er and the senior associate justice, ustiee Gary, presided, and after the urt had retired and recou ened, an ounce the decision of the court. The rmal opinion will be filed later. When the case was called this iorning, Mr. George Johnstone, for he defense, stated that there were our matters before the court; the ap eal by the defense from the order of udge Hydrick, the appeal by the tate from the order of the chief jus ece,; the motion pendente lite and the iotion for bail in the original juris iction of the supreme court. The Lefense was willing to abandon the ppeal from Judge Hydrick's order nd was willing to move to rescind be order of Chief Justice Pope, and s to the motion pendente lite, that ras not now of any consequence, and he defense preferred to proceed on he motion in the original jurisdiction f the supreme court. Mr. P. H. Nelson, for the State, an ounced that the State would not con ent to the rescinding of the chief astice's order, but desired to argue he matter, whereupon the chief jus ice withdrew. This was the. initial iotory for the prosecution in the un ngling of the legal web. Mr. J. A. Sawyer, for the State ien read the argument of the State i the appeal from the order of the hief justice and Mr. Johnstone made e argument in reply for the defense, ontending that while he considered e order proper, else he would not ave applied for it, he did not now nsider it anything but an academie uestion before the court. The argument in the Jones case nsumed the entire morning session ad at two o 'clock the court took a re ass until four o'clock when the case 'as again taken up. Further affiaavits were read and rguments made by both sides and a umber of affidavits were simply anded up to the court, nearly the tire record being printed. At six 'lock the case was concluded and e court took it under advisement. Ir. Johnstone in concluding his ar ument for the petitioner stated that e appeal from the order of Judge [ydrick would then be abandoned. Er. Nelson sta.ted he had understood ie court had dismissed that appeal, I ut Mr. Johnstone replied thiat he did ot understand it, only some expres Lon to that effect having been made y members of the .court. There was o declaration from the bench as to hether or not the appeal was dis issed and the record does not show. bat it was dismissed, so that the ourt has under consideration both Le appeal from Judge Hydrick 's rder and the application for bail in be original jurisdietion of the court. ones was in court today in the custo of an officer and was accompanied y his 12 year old son.

SEARCHING RESOLUTION. Senator Bailey Brands President's Message as a Direct Insult Tillman's Opinion. Washington, D. C., Dec. 16.-The senate today devoted considerable ;ime to discussion of the president's ,ourse in placing strictures on con ,ress in the matter of the secret ser ice, and adopted a searching resolu ion, proposed by Senator Aldrich and amended on the suggestion of 3enator Culbertson, providing for a -horough investigation of the presi lent's charges both in respect to the :acts and the course to be taken by ongress to resent the imputations )elieved to have been cast upon that 3ody. Senator Foraker's resolution call ng on the secretary of war for infor nation concerning the work of detee tives in the Brownsville affair was ilso .adopted. Except for a few moments spent in the transaction of routine business, th-e house today devoted its entire time to further consideration of the bill to revis'e the penal laws of the United States. The Garrett amend ment, which prohibted sending through the mails information bear ing on transactions in futures, was efeated by a decided vote. Senator Bailey objected to the re olution evidently because he did not like the wording of it. In the course of his remarks, he said: "The presi dent is not so careful in what he says about congress, and I do not under stand why congress is so careful about what it says about -him. I regard this as most insulting message ever sent to any body. I doubt if a mayor ever sent such a message to a corrupt city council. I believe in talking plainly to people who talk plainly to us. I believe in reciprocity of that kind. If the president is not justified in mak ing those statements, that message ought to be sent back to him. No ielf-respee:irg body should receive a message which impeaches its honor." Senator Newlands spoke at consid rable length, saying the question at issue was as to whether the secret serviee has been used to investigate congressmen in pursuance of their egi,lative duties or only to\ detect fraud in duties devolving upon ere mtive department. "But,'' interpos ad Tillmnan, "the president's mes age shows he investigated us gener lly, and that we are a lot of sconn rels that need investigation. Now, ;here may be men here who feel that ay, but God knows I do not.'' The Clerk of the Senate. To the; Editor of the News and Coi -ier: I served as clerk of the senate >f South Carolina fourteen years, and luring most of thre time was associat d with the most patriotic and intel ient men in the State, the senate be ~ng made up of such men. It was a reat honor, privilege and distinction or me. Continued sickness makes it mt of the question for me to offer !or the place again. The clerk of the house of represen atives and the clerk of the senate are the most important offices in the tate. From current newspaper com nent it appears that the clerk of the senate is regarded as of about the same importance as the average store clerk. To fill the bill he has to be that and much more. 'He should be a man of good appear ance, strictly temperate, polished man ners and of such equanimity of mind as not to be upset by any occurrence. He should be quick and accurate in his work and his health should be such that he can stand any extra pres sure required day and' night. He hold understand parliamentary law, for, if he does not, he will not know how to handle a bill even after acted upon. He should have a voice f good compass and his enunciation iould be clear and distinct. The clerk of the senate should know ho0w to amend bills, what en dorsements to put on themi and be able to see and know when the senate rinting is properly done. Robert R. HemphilL.
