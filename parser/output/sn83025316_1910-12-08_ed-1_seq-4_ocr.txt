GERMANY'S CENSUS. *he kaiser is taking the census of his people, yrhich means that he has Inlructear~his subjects to count them selves. He expects that the completed count will show that there are 65,000, 000 Germans: who have not yet started for the United States, a gain of 4,5600,000 since 1905. This is the government's estimate and may be a trifle too optimistic, but, at best, it shows a rate of increase something less than half as large as that of this country. The census :n Germany is not taken by.official question askers, as. here, but by means of a series of intricate blanks, which every house holder " is obliged to fill out. The German citizen is accustomed to re port at regular intervals to the police as to his whereabouts and, general health, but the census questions have him scratching his 'head and diving for 'the dictionary. The kaiser doesn't quibble about searching a man's most private affairs, as the following ques tions, taken from the census blanks. testify: "If you don't know the exact date of your birth, how mhany full years old are ybu?" "What's your main occupation in life?' "Were Your bablies nursed on ,their mother's breast or by wet nurses, or from a bottle?" "Are you' subject to epileptic fits?" "How many of your houuo windows look out on. the street ?'.. " Vhat was your mother tongue German,- Dutch, tarieiar, Danish, Wal loniah, Polish, or Lithuanian--and what are the names of. the various rooms In, your dwAlling?"

HMakin. The most serious constitutional con troversy that has arisen in Great Britain strice the days of the revolu tion under Oliver Cromwell is being decided by the British electors in the general election now being held. Whether the' final result is a liberal or a conservative ..triumph, the con stitution of Great Britain never again will be the nsame. The fate of the house of lords hangs in the balance. No, political party in Great Britain puhbclty champions the continued existence of 'the house of lords In its presdla forth. The mints terialist party, composed of a coali tion of liberals, Irish-nationallsts, la borites and socialists, is fighting as a unit under the radical ensign to end the existence of the house of lords as a co-ordinate ibranch of the British legislature. The opposition party, technically an alliance of conserva tives and liberal uniqnlsts, an4 having the support of a few disaffected lIb erals and malcontent Irishmen, is fighting as a unit under the tory ban ner to mend the house of lords. But whether it be ended by -the radicals, or mended by the tories, it is certain that. the house of lords as a legislative body basing its powers solely on the hereditary ptfnelple- the accident of birth--cannot longer endure. It Is the '"o.ly purely heredi tary legltlative assomiblage now exist ing in any first clasp natioi. It is an anachronism and the time has come when it must tall-before the advance of democracy. Everybody in England, at least, as far as public 'utteirances are con cerned, is in -favor of democratising the house of lords. -lverybody is agreed that the heriditary principle no longer shall be the controlling fac tor in making tip the personnel of the second and upper chamber of the nta tional aria, imperial legislature. If one could take the stump speeches of all the candidates 'togpther- and, cut out the details he would find that every body was compmitted to, the same principle with respect to.. the chief is sue--those principles being an ac knowld# t of the necessity of a secenb han)ber, a repidkltioio of the hereditary .principle in the constitution of that-'chamber, and the necessity of bringing tire Members. of the upper house into' more direct contact with the people., The proverbial Man from Mars might find it diffioit to deterntine why when everybody is agreed , in prllhlple, there should be such a tre mendous b-bttle about the details' of the legislation Intended to make those pilnclples. effective. As a matter of tact, the details are all important and the principles, simply as principles, *inount to 'nothing. -The house of lords is. now composed bhf,rqmething more than 600 hereditart pers of whom all but about three roe are torles-tories in politics, tor le in reilg.on. aihd torne, iln. poclety. WWen I~the electors' of- ;rtbat Britain are pleased to elect- a parliament hav in.k k' conservative majority, the tory .thilltry formed Under, and re silble to, that parliament has no Ifhtulty 'vhatever in making up' a 1tSilattve .program, secure in.the cer t 'ithowldge that the government ,pd ;, as passed by the house of ot.il, 11l be approved by the i of" lords. tý'hthe otjer hand, when the liberal. p.{ .has.s arried the country, when tf a liberal majority in the hopts 4n cnot and a liberal ministry is aFtvl*ng the crown, then the govern-. ijtiti never--Is sure that any one of l : poeasureq has even a remote chance of being enacted into law. In the past l 'years the house 'of commons has. rejected or mutilated not less than; 50 Important government measures which had been duly passed by the commons. In the same period of time the lords have never rejected, nor have they amended in important detail, any measures sent up by a tory majority in the lower chamber. In other words, the British consti tution now permits 'the people qual-l fled to vote in general elections , to control, through their representatives. matters of legislation, provided, that these same electors have approved tory legislation by electing a majority of tory members to the'houce. But the constitution, in its present form, does not permit the people to register their will in statutory law if they approve of liberal legislation by electing 4 ma Jority of liberal members. This diffi' culty having lately become so patent that no man dares to deny the exist ence of the fact, the leaders of both parties agreed that the house of lords must be reconstituted. And upon that question of reconstitution of the upper chamber depends the future of the British constitution-a future today in the hands of the electors of the united chamber. The questions involved in this great constitutional controversy first be came acute in 1906 when the liberal party canlried the country by a tre mendous mnajoirity in the house of commons. The house passed an edu cation bill, providing for the divorce of church and state in the manage ment and control of the common schools. This bill was mutilated be yond recognition by the irresponsible house of lords. A liernsing bill, aimed at a restriction of the liquor traffic, met a similar fate. A bill to restrict plural voting on property qualificltion also was rejected by the peers. Their lordships made it quite plain to 'the leaders of the majority in the house of commons that no bill Incorporating the principles. qf progressive economic or social philosophy would be toler ated. Nearly threecenturles ago, under. the leadership, of Oliver Cromwell. the commons asserted their exeleltle right and power to control the purse strings of the nation. After the restoraton Ot the"monarchy the' house O co.m monns nolmealy proclaimed by, a seri dt reiolutlons that the commons ha4 the sole right to levy taxes, Jo mst e ebtpnditures on the public -ccoutq atei* to hate 1 tiguts l tge l alone Wills ~otlt3 in the house of lords.' "' or nearly three centuries this claim of the com mons was not questioned. The king; in his speech froni fle throne, al yays was cateful to .direct his re marks concerning revenues and ex penditures solely to the Commons, ex pressly excluding the lords. The special interests of aristocracy and plutocracy repreeentd In the up per chamber and having no stomach for democracy, heeded .well tl e lesson of the Cromwellian 'revolution and cheerfully admitted by no.-contention the exclusive control of the commons over the purse strings. But of course the aristocrats and the plutocrats were not willing to give up .their ac tual control of the treastry, so they instituted a system of controlling the house of commons.by means of mem bers returned from rotten boroughs, and by the most shameless bribery and corruption. For 200 years this con dition of affairs 'obtained. •During all that time the electors went through the form of sendlng" their, representa tives to parliament, but the majority of the members of the house were controlled by the great lords of priv ilege and noble birth.' Finally the people become indig. nant, threw off their shackles of cor ruptloh and managed, In 1832, to com pel the enactment of the reform bill, which materially advanced .the moral condition of British politics, and which seemd to give the people tire right to control their own' affairs. But there, was no party representing true de= mocracy, There was a tory aristoc racy, and a whig aris toracy. Whether conservative or liberal every political leader belonged to what was known as, the "ruling class," and there was not. one who failed 46 recognise the de mands of caste. In 1906 the . reorganised And- recon structed liberal party won the elece tion and the affalrs of government were "turned over to a. mininstry in which the whig eleanent was over whelmed by the modern progressive democratic element. For"-the- first time the plain people of EIngland and not the ruling classes 'had: a majority in parliament. The fate obf the legis lation they initiated has -een outlined. Every measure died in the house of lords. But the commons still had the power of the purse. They resolved .to attack the bulwarks of the aristoc racy by exercising their exclusive power of taxation, realizing to the full that the power to t 3,4 the power to destroy. They attai.4 e I4d mo nopoly. r The bulget of 1909, Introduced: by 'David Lloyd-Georged' t -cellor. ofL the exchequer, provided f j.lhe taxation ,.: land values. The *buse of lords, male tip of the owners of more than three-fourths of all the land in Great Britain, refused to sb.mit their prop erty to taxation. Thy.. rejeOted the budget. The controversy was referred to the people ands in'Januaryof~,this year, onnly. 1 Stlontl.tlMti#i lAle 15l gelea coalition was retyrlp4o1o power and the tories were. defea.d. .1The lords bowed to the will .of. the pepple with respect to this one metsure. only and passed the land taxes. But they were not willing to abrogatetheir power to amend and rpject legislative bills other than money bills; They ac knowledged dnly that.jthe verdict of the election confirmed. the ,,commons In their .ight. to qealO egdtlonal an&d constitutional control over the puree stringd. The prime minister, Mr. Asquith, introduced a bill in parliament pro viding that a measure passed three times by the house of coimons. with in two years should become law even without the approval of the-"house of lords. Thfs was known as the veto bill, since it abrogated the lords' right to veto legislation approved by the commons. The only way the veto bill ever can 'becomie a law is for it to pass the house of lords. The only way to get the house of lords td Veto itsee out of existence is for the king to create a pufficient number of rad~q~I peers to. overcome the tor,. ..Jpority in the upper house. As,the .ing mut: act on the advice of his slangisters, it was expected that Mr. Asquith. would ask the king for "guarasptees" to make the, will of the peoplje effective in this fashion.
