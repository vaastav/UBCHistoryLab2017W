Washington dispatches sent out In last few days say that chargee ave been filed with the president as ertlng that Shaw dictated the charg agalnst Secretary of the Interior A.

Glavis Taken Off Otar. It was the forest service which In rvened at the last moment to in 1st that Glavis be given more time which to complete his Investiga on of the claims, but Immediately fter the extension of time was ranted Glavis was taken from the se, and It was turned over to James Sheridan.

WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dee. 7.— President Taft's first regular annual message to coagreee was sent to that body today. It consists of about 20,000 words snd at that leaves for subsequent discussion in special manages the Important subjects of anti-trust and interstate commerce legislation as well as legislation for farther laws to promote the conser vation of the natural resources. These questions are mostly referred to Incidentally in the present mess age. With regard to Nicaragua, Presi dent Taft refers to the "sad tale of the unspeakable barbaraltles and oppression alleged to have been com mitted by the Zelaya government,'* and to the feet that two Americans were recently pnt to death by ordet of Zelaya hlmaelf and says that thie government is proceeding "with de liberate circumspection" to deter mine the exact truth and the course to be pursued "most consistent with its dignity. Its duty to American In terests and Its moral obligation to Central Amerloa." The message ex onerates Japan from the charge of seeking a monopoly la Manchuria and says that our relation* with that country continue cordial as usual. It points out the successful efforts that have been made to bring about econ omy In government expenses, the es timates for government expenses hav ing been cut over (GB.OOO.dOO. The president recommends that the de ficit In the treasury shall he met by the Issue of Panama bonds. Legislation to produce expedition in legal procedure is asked for as well as a law to prevent the Issu ance of Injunctions without notice. The president recommends the estab lishment of postal savings banka and the passage of a ship subsidy bill looking to the establishment of a line to South America, China, Japan and the Philippines. He urged the ad mission aa separate states of New Mexico and Arlsona and suggests the appointment of an executive council for Alaska, hut strongly dep recates the idea of the election of a territorial legislature for that dis trict. Scores Sugar Trust. Referring to the frauds discovered at the New York customs house, of which the sugar trust was the bene ficiary, the president says that the government has recovered from the trust all that it is shown to have been defrauded of from under welghts and that the treasury depart ment and department of justice are exerting every effort to discover the wrong doers "including the officers and employers" of the trust with view to criminal prosecution. The president adds that it seems to him that a congressional investigation of the frauds at this time might, by giving Immunity and otherwise, prove aa embarrassment In securing con vlcttons of the guilty parties The message la part la as <ol lows: Wants Fur Seals Protected Negotiations for an international conference to consider and reach aa arrangement providing for the pres ervation and protection of the fjrj seals lr the North Pacific are la p.r-. •eats In the Nortn t'acinc are is p.< grass with the goveraments of Gras*, j Britain. Japan and Russia. The *Ul- ( tnde of the govern menu latere tied lead* me to hope foe a aatlafartorr settlement of this question as th* ultimate outcome of the negotia tions. "The question arising out of the Belgian annexation of the Independ ent state of Congo which ban so long and earnestly preoccupied the at tention of the government and en listed the sympathy of our heat citi saaa Is still opsu. hut to a mors hope ful stage. The aaaoaaeed program .im A of reforms while striking at many of the evils known to exist, are an augury of better things. The atti tude of the United States Is one of benevolent encouragement, coupled j with a hopeful trust that the good work, responsibility undertaken snd xealously perfected to the accomplish- j ment of the resalta so ardently de-] sired, will soon justify the wisdom thst Inspire# them and will satisfy the demands of humane sentlmept throughout the world." Taking up the Central American situation, the president says: Paa-Americas Policy. "The Pan-American policy of this government has long been fixed in Its principles and remains unchang ed. With the changed circumstances of the United States and of the re publics to the south of us, moat of which have great natural resources, stable government and progression Ideals, the apprehsaslon which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared and neither the doctrine, aa It exista. nor any other doctrine af American pol icy should be permitted to perpetu ate an irresponsible government, the escape of just obligations or ths In sidious allegation of domination of ambitions on the part of the United States. "Beslds the fundamental doctrine of our pan-American policy tbqr** have grown up a realisation of polit ical Interests, community of Instltu tions and. idaals and a flourishing commerce. All these bonds will be greatly strengthened aa time goes on and Increased facilities sack as the great banks soon to he established In Latln-America. supply the means fer building np the eoloesal interconti nental commerce of the future. Xkacagwa Disturber. "Since the Washington conventions of 1907 were communicated to the government of the United States as a consulting and advising party thfk government has been almost eontlaa oosly called upon by one or another and In turn by all of the five Can tral American republics to easrt U self for the maintenance of tbo con ventloan. Nearly every complaint has bean against ths Zelaya govern amt of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America la constant tension of turmoil. The responses made to the representations of Central A lea republics aa due from the United States on account of Its relation to the Washington conventions, have been at ail times conservative and have avoided, so far aa possible, say semblance of Interference, although It la very apparent that the eoasid orations of geographic proximity to the canal sons sad to the very sub stantial American Interests la Can tral America give to the United States a special position la the of these republics snd the Caribbean Promote Peace of Republics. "1 need not rehearse the patient . SorU of " thl , C0T< , rUMa( to pro j mote peace and welfare among the republics, efforts which are fully ap 'predated by the majority of them j who are loyal to their true Interests, t would be less unnecessary to hearse here the sad tale of unapeak able barbarities and oppressions si to have been committed by the Zelayan government. Recently two Americans were put to death by or der of President Zslnya himself. They were the organised force of a revo lution which had continued many weeks and was In control of About half the republic, and aa such, ac cording to the modern enlightened practice of civilised nations, they were entitled to be dealt with as pris oners of war. Nicaragua HUeaUou. ."At the date when this message Is printed this government has ter minated diplomatic relations with the Zelayan government, for reasons made public In a communication to the former Neoaraguan charge d'affaires, and is Intending to take such steps as will be found most con it latent with Its dignity, its duty to American interests and Its moral ob ligation* to Central America and to civilisation. It later may be a aary for me to bring this subject to the attention of congress in a special message." Relations With Orient. On the relations of the United States with the orient, the president says: { real Impel as "in the far east this government preserves Its policy of snpportlng the principle of equality of opportunity and scrupulos respect for the Integ rity of the Chinese empire, to which policy are pledged the Interested powers of both oast and west. When It appeared that Cblnaee revenues were to be hypothecated to foreign bankers In connection with a grant railway project. It was obvious that the governments whose nations had this Iona would have a certain object la the carrying out by China of the reforms la question. Because this railroad loan represented a practical and real application of the open door policy through cooperation with re forms referred to above, the adminis tration deemed American partiripa tlon to be of great national later Fiti niHag Our Commer c e .
