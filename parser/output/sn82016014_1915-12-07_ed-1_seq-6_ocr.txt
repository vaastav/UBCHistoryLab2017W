Herman ajient, who is accused of com- Ing to this county to incite Btrikers ; In munition factories, armed with a Jar ere corruption fund, was "double grossed" by the iabor men he tried to " corrupt and despite the expenditure f several hundred thousand dollars, : failed to accomplish his mission in any effective manner- Mr. Marshall Rave the major credit for IUntelen's fail ure to the stand taken by high of ficials in labor organizations. l "Kintelen only succeeded in cor rupting some subordinates," Mr. Mar r shall said, "and he was beautifully i double crossed. The real labor lead " ers took prompt steps to check activi ties. Save for a few small strikes, : nor.e of his efforts was successful and . all the strikes he did instigate were quickly killed by the good men at the i head of unions. I am not prepared ;to state just how much money Kin ; telen expended but it ran into hun ' dreds of thousands of dollars. Me had I $500,000 to his credit in one bank." Mr. Marshall refused to comment ;on David Lamar's activities in the , scheme beyond saying emphatically : that he would not be called as a wit ness before the grand jury a pro ; ceeding which might give him im - tnunity from prosecution. If suffi cient evidence is obtained it is ex .pected indictment will be sought gainst the labor men who accepted 1 Itintelen's money. Mr. Marshall stat ed that these men could be prosecut ed under the Sherman lav on the ground they had conspired to restrain the trade of the United States in mu nitions. Rintelen is at present held a prison er by the Ilritish authorities in the Tower of London. No attempt will be made to extradict him as Mr. Mar shall says his offense is not extradita ble.

Farmers Against the "One Crop" System. New Orleans, Dec. 7. Dr. Bradford Knapp of the- United States depart ment of agriculture in his address on "Safe Farming" before the cotton states bankers conference today, de clared the one-crop system as "un safe and unsound, and the marvel is that the south has come thus far with out overpowering disaster." The southern farmers, m? asserted, have not become rich and prosperous because the system has been against them. They have been farming to pay debt and not on a cash basis.

B30FENS UP Nebraskan to Fight Lynch as I McCombs's Successor. bers of that body have been Inter ested mainly hi the bomb which Mr. Bryan left behind him here. The Nebraskan was mightily inter ested in the story of the covert move against Chairman McComba made by the administration' forces. Hut his interest centered rather more on the possibility of Committeeman Fred Lynch, of Minnesota, gettins power than upon McComba losing it. In fact, Mr. Bryan's interest was so in tense that he authorized a -national committeeman to announce that if Mr. Lynch were made chairman he would denounce that action publicly and fight the selection with every weapon at his command. A Warning to AH. The Bryan threat is the more sig nificant in that it not merely applies to any action at- the present commit tee meeting but to any future promo tion of Mr. Lynch to the chairman ship. It is a warning not only to the national committee but to the possible nominee of the 1916 convention that a campaign managed by Lynch will be a campaign fought against the Bryan opposition. This is the more embarrassing to the Wilson forces, because they have already entrusted to Air. Lynch certain political functions usually reserved for the chairman of the committee. He i understood to have begun collecting funds in New York already. And Mr. I Lynch is a good collector. In fact, it is upon the nature of his collections that the Bryan hostility, which is an cient, is based. Too Close to Hill. Mr. Lynch is accused of being too much allied with James J. Hill to be a real Democrat of the Bryan stripe and the nature of the contributions he re ceived in the 1008 campaign are cited as his influence with the money power and the great corporations. Although the Bryan influence is not strong within the committee, its members fear the effect of any such denuncia tion by him of a man selected by the president to run the campaign. MAD DOG 

SCARE Commissioner Porter Makes Wild llusli to East side in Answer to a Telephone Call. The telephone rang in Commission er W. L. Porter's office this morning and that official turned to it. He listened attentively then hung up the receiver with a bang. "Mad dog at 313 Branner street," he exclaimed. Turning to Clyde Tresner as he hunted his overcoat and gloves, he shouted: "Get somebody and come, Clyde. There's another mad dog; down on the East side." Three men hurried downstairs and out to Commissioner Porter's Ford. The motor ' was cold and it had to be cranked four'tiraes in three blocks. Porter had visions of a wild-eyed ani mal rushing through the East side im planting microbes in innocent by standers at every corner. He crouch ed over the wheel and gave an imita- JtTKXILE GOLF SF.TS (From S to 12 years of age).

Things seemed to bo unnaturally quiet on the Fast side. There were no persons in trees nor on roofs. Even at 313 Branner there was no sign of excitement. Commissioner Porter rushed through the sate and into the back yard. "Where's the mad dog?" he de manded of a woman at the back door. "Out there in a. crate," was the reply. And there in a big crate was a mite of a white dog. Besides being crated he was tied with a rope. Out of the tangle he looked at Commissioner Porter with a friendly eye and as best he could wagged his tail. Porter lifted the crate and disentangled the rope. The little dog frisked about his feet and made friends with him instantly. He didn't look like a mad dog and didn't act like one. so Porter carried him out to the car and brought him to the city building to protect him from further slander.

Parsons is in an awful mess con cerning her municipal politics, accord ing to John Madden, Jr., a Parsons lawyer. The recent crusade against city officials of Parsons lias aroused the town, he says, and there is a dandy political row in view as a re sult of the mix-up. "If things are not ironed out, La bette county will elect more Democrats to office next year than at any time in the history of the county," Madden told the state house friends today. "I am a staunch Republican, but there Isn't any use of dodging the facts. The recent troubles down there have certainly stirred up the local leaders and either side that is beaten in the primaries will carry its fight to the general election."

REMEMBER SHUT-INS 'Servant in the House" Will Be Given fridny Night for Their Benefit by C. E. Societies. The Topeka local union of Christian Endeavor societies in offering the "Servant in the House'' at the Auditor ium Friday night is not only giving Topekans an exceptional entertain ment, but every person who buy a ticket will have extended to him an opportunity of sharing in brightening the Christmas day of a shut-in. The Thanksgiving day program of the Union for years has included the distribution of flowers amongs those who are confined to their homes through sickness or other causes. This year the regular plans could not be carried out through lack of funds. From the receipts of the play Friday night, it is expected that the fund for the purchase of flowers will be swelled sufficiently to make possible a visit at the home of every shut-in. The original company will present the play and only because Friday night was an open date was it possioie lor the local union to bring the cast here at prices far below those charged reg ularly. Tickets may oe reservea at j. C. Wolcott's store, 825 Kansas ave nue.

GERMAN POLICY Teutonic Paper Says at Conclusion of Peace It Must lie In Their Favor. London, Dec. 7. Telegraphing from Amsterdam the correspondent of Bea ter's Telegram company says: "George Bernhard in the Vossische Zeitung, anticipating peace discussions in the reichstag. writes: " 'The main and whole point Is that we in the eventual conclusion of peace shall find an outlet for our interna tional policy which shall allow us to pursue our clear goals with the least friction and risk. " The aim of this policy can only be in the interest of the German peo ple and the German empire. The wish to liberate other peoples can only be satisfied if thereby the military security of the empire and the peaceful development of til -3 peo ple are not interfered with.

THEY SHOULD WORRY Steel Men Pay Ittle Attention to Wil son's Mention of 25 Cent Steel Tax. New Tork, Dec. 7. The suggestion of President Wilson in his annual message to congress today that pig iron and finished steel be taxed 25 cents a ton, does not appear to worry steel manufacturers here. They fig ure it was stated in their behalf to day, that even if the tax is enforced it will mean little as compared with present enormous profits. Besides some persons who have considered the subject do not believe such a tax can be made lawful. In figuring on the returns from the tax it was pointed out that the United States is today turning out pig iron at the rate of 38,000,0.00 tons annually and of finished forms about 34,000,000 tons. The proposed tax, based on this production, would mean a total reve nue of ?1S, 000,000 for the government.
