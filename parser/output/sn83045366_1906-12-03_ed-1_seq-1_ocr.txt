One has onlv to stand at any station on the Great Northern main line and watch the business pass up and down and note the bungling operation, the careless indifference, the incompetency that under other circumstances would be a disgrace to the profession of rail road management. He has then to con sider that this is not the result of a lack of education or experience on the part of the railroad mennot at all. It is a condition of affairs entirely foreseen by the railroads and fully al lowed for in advance, with all its ac companiment of criticism and curses anc of hardship upon the people, and deliberately entered into by the roads under the craze for economy and in pursuance of what has become the lode star of railroad direction and control, economy of operation.'' Curses deep and loud, are going up from North Dakota upon the head of the man who first invented the "ton mile But what matters the impre cation of a people or the choking of the commercial life current of a coun try if the cost per "ton mile" of mov ing freight can be pounded down an other decimal point? p^^^^s^^ CROP BLOCKADE DUE TO RAILROAD POLICY Excessive Economy in Operation Expense Charged with Present Tie-up--I.

I will take such a train thirty minutes to get in and out of Rugby or any other point where it needs to stop and start again. That engine could, in a season, easily cover double distance up and down between Devils Lake and Minot and the country would be immensely benefited. It could do this if only the last big part of the forced tonnage were lopped off, but it must not be lopped off. Twice the stuff could be moved in or out in a month, but obvi ously the cost, "per ton per mile" woi\ld be greater, and since the stuff is there and the railroads will get it any way and there is nothing the people can do, and since the reduction of ex pense of operation is the railroad aim ani purpose piesent conditions are as they be, from the railroad stand g)int.shouldstatio ar That is why carsnorth loaded out 0 5 a just of heref, bept. 20, and having to pass thru Rugby to go east, were still standing at Fero the first station east of here on Nov 19 a delay of sixty days.

Waterloo, Iowa, Dec. 3.Chicago Great Western officials are gathering evidence that is said to disclose one of the boldest and most far-reaching spe cies of graft ever* perpetrated in this pait of the country. The alleged grafting is said to have been carried on for yeais and to con sist of a systematic padding of the pay rolls of section men and other em ployees. On most of the sections five men are employed, but it is alleged that in many cases but two or three would be hired, while the pay rolls would call for the full quota. So far as deter mined the "rake off" has amounted to $2,000, but it is expected further in vestigation will disclose a much larger sum. As yet no arrests have been made, but thev are impending. The plan of padding pay rolls has been frequently practiced in new coun tries in the west, but this is the first time it has been discovered on such a scale in a densely populated country. 

SHAH IS VERY LOW Persia's Crown Prince Called Home to Take Control. Journal Special Service. Teheran, Dec. S*Owing to the shah's critical condition the ministers held a meeting yesterday at which they decided to call upon the crown prince to como as soon as he could from Tabriz to take his father's place. The crown prince is now on the way here. Simultaneously it is learned that Dr. Damsch's optimistic predictions as to the shah are not justified. He has accomplished nothing at all. Other doc tors say Dr. Damsch first threw respon sibility upon them, saying their treat ment was wrong. Now he himself is trying to get away so as to avoid re sponsibility, and has returned the huge fee which he had accepted for the treatment of the shah.

GILLETTE SOO N WILL KNO W FATE Trial of the Alleged Slayer of "Billy" Brown Approaches End. Herkimer, N. Y., Dec. 3.Chester E. Gillette, the young factory foreman of Cortland on trial here for the alleged murder of Grace Brown, his sweetheart, probably will know his fate within the i'flext twenty-four hours. A few minor bits of testimony were added this morning, and then District Attorney Ward faced the jury to close tor the state. His argument was a scathing indictment of Gillette, alleg ing that he murdered "Billy" Brown when her condition became such that only the speedy marriage sought by the girl, but undesired by the defendant, could prevent a public scandal. Ridicules State's Case. A. M. Mills, summing up for the de fense, denounced the manner in which the state's case had been conducted. He denied that proof had been estab lished of the leading allegations and said that no motive had been shown for murder. Gillette's relations with the girl, said Mr. Mills, would not have placed him in danger of prison, and knowing this, he would have no desire to kill the girl, who, he said, was 26 years old. "Those letters," he said, "were mar vels for a farmer's daughter." Every effort will be made to give the case to the .-jury tonight, and, if neces sary, a night session will be held.
