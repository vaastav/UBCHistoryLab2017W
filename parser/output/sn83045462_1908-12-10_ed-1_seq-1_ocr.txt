In the Senate the President's objec- ^ lionable remarks will be expunged from tl f the record. . . ? h In the House?the message not being o printed in the Record?that portion of P the President's utterances relating to the ^ secret service will be referred to a spe- P p < ial committee which will move that the objectionable portion of the message be laid on the table. e: The committee will present its reasons g for this action. si Some time today Representative Perkins of New York will introduce a resolution l' providing for the appointment by the b Speaker of this special committee. The ti committee will meet late this afternoon, it is thought, and the rebuke to the Pres- I. TJ ident of the United States will be made in both houses of Congress tomorrow. c< Membership of Committee. f, It is not known as yet just what the f< ' membership of the special committee will b be. But it is thought that Chairman Tawncy of the House appropriations commit- ti ; tee will be one of those chosen to sit in ir judgment on the utterances of President Koosevelt. ^ The appropriations committee recom- a, mended the inclusion of the provision tl limiting the activities of the secret serv-. a: ice to the detection and capture of counterfeiters and the protection of the President in the sundry civil bill of last year, p and after considerable debate on the floor si of the House, in which the President's friends in the body assailed the appropriations committee and defended the employment of government detectives by all the departments of the government t! for various purposes. Including the un- tl tangling of family and social scandals e] affecting officials of the government serv- tl ice, the provision was included in the measure as it passed the House. The d< Senate retained it and it went into the CJ law, effectually putting a stop to methods ?! which Jiad resulted in the employment by is the secret service of more and more men w each year and of a great widening of its pi scope of activity. .Mr. Tawney being chairman of this ^ committee and one of the principal movcrs in the matter of the provision of limi talion, it is felt that lie should be a mem- ni b_*r of the committee which prepares the tt' President's punishment. Members of Congress appreciate the fact ai i hat the President has a perfect right tc in his message to call attention to what lie believes to be mischievous legislation and to point out what he considers to be j; errors made by the national lawmakers. Put they say he has no right at all to attribute to them motives which were not in their minds or state that such and sucli P arguments were used by them in securing * the passage of legislation, when as a ^ matter of fact such arguments were never ? used at all. ? C Not Afraid of Investigation. 8l Coming down to brass tacks, member b after member?most of them of wide and powerful Influence in the House?told a ^ Star reporter today that in stating that ii the principal argument used to secure d the passage of the secret-service limita- r: lion provision, that members of Congress Q were afraid of being Investigated, was a absolutely untrue. They declared their C willingness to get up on the floor of the a House and make this statement in such d terms as to convince the American peo- 0 ?le that there was more than one can- ? vasser working to secure members for p the Ananias Club. A number of members, it is under- s, stood, went to Speaker Cannon and told n him they wanted to jump up in their places and be recognized as a matter K of the highest personal privilege for the K purpose or replying 10 tlie ^resident's a statement. Some of these men were democrats, and j* it was the fact that some democrat might D take occasion to go it alone on ids own a hook in denunciation of Mr. Roosevelt f that has led to concerted action by the a two houses. All of this morning and early " afternoon members of the House were chasing over to the Senate and. members el of the Senate were traveling toward the House, and there were several confer?-nces going 011 all the time. Finally the * plan outlined above was framed up, and, barring some unforeseen circumstances, ' will be put Into execution as soon as pos- v siblc. j: ' Tired of Being Browbeaten."

This would leave only $1,500,000 balance f the appropriation to acquire the four :maining squares, one with a frontage i the avenue, which is generally condered worth twro or three times the price f the property three squares below that loroughfare. The expert testimony, given at the earing yesterday, which began at " "clock and lasted until nearly 0 o'clock, laced the valuation of the proprty at from $6 to $10 per square foot, rithout the improvements. The average rice, considering the entire square, was laceu ai $4.zi a 1001. $10 for Corner Realty. Eldridge E. Jordan qualified as a realty Xpert and gave as his opinion that the round at the corner of 14th and B treets northwest is worth $10 per square >ot. He declined, under eross-examinaion, to change his valuation. Dwight Anderson, another real estate roker. placed $8.50 a foot as his valuaon of the Moses property at the 14th and ! street corner. ~ He was followed on the stand by Jesse .. Heiskell of the real estate firm of r Teiskell & McLeran, who agreed with L lr.

He placed ftJ n average price of $7.50 a square foot on ' le property fronting B and 14th streets, nd including the corner. Rignald W. Beall of Moore & Hill Comany was the last witness examined. He C] alued the corner property at $10, the 1th street frontage at $8, and the B treet property at $7.50 per square foot. ? Mode of Procedure Y. The question as to the mode of proeeure which arose at Monday's session of le commission was argued at length at M le hearing yesterday. The commisslonrs determined to leave the settlement of le controversy to Justice Anderson. The government claims that the con?mnation is to be considered- as one ?sc and that the property owners of the itirc five squares shall first present tes- gp mony as to value before the government to be called on to bring its expert ' itnesses before the commission. The noperty holders oppose this and seek o'< ther to have each square disposed of or re ? have the testimony concerning each cj( siding exhausted before proceeding with . le property of the adjoining owner. The instruction given by the court is re ot sufficiently definite to determine the jestion. The instruction is general and so rders the government to give its bound- er ry testimony* the owners to give valu- _ tion evidence and then the government ' > be heard. 'a

By the time his eyes had , become accustomed tb the sight he saw two other big guns, also pointed at him. L The three robbers had climbed noiseless1 ly over the tender from the back. They had Perrin and Bowen covered without a ' chance for life. "Just run her out about a mile." said one of the robbers, and Bowen did so. "Now pull her up." said the robber when the proper point had been reached. Two of the men then climbed down, one on each side of the engine cab. Both covered Bowen. "Come down here, ydu." said one or them to Perrin. Ordered to Uncouple. Then the third robber climbed down with Perrin, and ordered him to go back and uncouple the train.' The other two covered Bowen meanwhile from either side of the track. "You uncouple this car," said the robber with Perrin. For a moment the fireman hbsltated. He knew the robber wanted to uwoouple the trafRfraa that the express cap would remain with the engine. This done, the engine with it would be run off some distance and the safe could be blown open without chance of interference from the passengers. "You'd better uncouple it up there." said Perrin. "You don't want to carry three coaches off with the engine." Express Car Left Behind. Perrin pointed to the coupling between s the baggage car, which was second on the r train, and the express car, which waa ' third. To uncouple these would mean that the express car would be left behind. - , In a second he had figured it out that ? these men would know something about t the make-up of trains. Though trains - were usually made up with the express car second, this one had been made up r with it in third place., "You don't want to carry the whole train off with you, do you?" asked the 1 fireman, while the gun was held in his ? face. "That's right," said the bandit, t So they walked forward and uncoupled , at the point Perrin indicated. t The three robbers, who, it was then . plain knew considerable about trains, hurl rledly climbed to the cab of the engine, leaving Bowen and Perrin with the main* . part of the train. They knew how to run . an engine. T Uil. V.1?. + ~ T V fliUC IU juvvv? ft j In a second they had it moving along i with the mail and baggage cars behind at a rapid pace. They ran it two miles " east on the track where they stopped to ' blow open the safe and get their booty. They rifled the mail and baggage cars. ) as it was later learned. But they got * little. There was nothing for them in ^ the baggage car, and little in^ the mail r bags. The express car, with $20,000 which a Spokane bank was sending to a Montana ' town, was safe with the dead train, left ' far behind. The bandits drove the engine on three miles farther to a point where one of ' their pals had a wagon and horses await* ing them. They left the engine on the * track and disappeared. ' For all their hard work and risk, Perrin ' had kept them from getting more than a ^ few hundred dollars. b ; WRIGHT USES NEW DEVICE. r ????. , . Noted Pianist Makes Series of Sue1 cessful Flights in France. L.E MANS, France, December 10.?Wilbur Wright, the American aeroplanist of 5 Dayton, Ohio, made a series of successful ! flights here yesterday. Four members of the British Aero Club went aloft separately with Mr. Wright as passengers. . None of the flights was marred by acctI dent. Mr. Wright employed for the first time , yesterday an ingenious device, consisting of a horizontal chain connecting the two 1 propellers of his aeroplane, designed to \ insure equilibrium and a safe landing in f case of the breaking of one of these pro| peller chains. 1 Orville Wright, whose immediate departure for France was announced about a fortnight ago, says that he has not yet ' definitely decided about going abroad. In communicating with friends in Washington. he said that he had incidentally mentioned the possibility of going abroad in the presence of a* local reporter. He added: "I said particularly that I did not know when I should be able to go, but the reporter apparently did, and I see that he has me already started. This is rather a surprise to some of my friends who see me daily hobbling about on crutches." It is possible that Orville Wright maygo abroad about the first of the year. Wilbur wants to consult with him and cannot spare the time to come home, and it Is, therefore, probable that Orville will go to France to see htm. Secretary Newberry Honored. Trueman H. Newberry.
