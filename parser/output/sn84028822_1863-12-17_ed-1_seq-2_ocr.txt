Tho Message opens with tho usual nc knowlcdgoments to God. The l'rasldctit notices thu stoppage by tho lliitlsh and French Governments of tho Confederate rams, forbidding them to luavo their ports. A supplemental African Slave Trade tro.ity has been mado, and carried Into execution, as we are next Informed. Tho first person Introduced Into tho message, therefore, Is a negro I The President proposes to sottlo with ling, laud some land claims in Washtilngtuu Terrl tory. Thu marltlmojnrlsdlctlon of Cuba, which been discussed betnecn thu United States ami Spain, Is a question to bo referred to tho uibltramont of a foreign power. Thu Scheldt due are to lie paid. It is rccummomlod that a list of thu names of all jmrsuns declaring their Intention to ho coma eltlzuns of tho United Status bo for watded to thu Secretary of thu Iutoilur, and that a law be passed for that purpose. It ii also recommended that thu law be so chang ed as to inaku the fact of voting a bar against any claim of no citizenship, set up by those ho desire an exemption from military ser vice. ltussla Is to make a lino of telegraph from our Pacific coast Tito Consul ir systems of tho United States begin to bo self sustaining Tho President recommends a telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, nnd also between Washington and tho forts on the Gull of Muxlco. A recommendation Is mado for a Navy yard on thu Atlantic Ocean, and also on thu Western rivers It Is suggested that a Government School bo established for thu fostering and '.raining of seamen for tho naval service. Tho I'ost Olllco Department Is nearly self- sustaining, being only about onu hundred and fifty thousand dollars short. Nuarly a million and half of acres of laud have been tahun up under the Homestead Law, The l'rusldeut recommends a modlfl cation of fho law In favor of only tho.su who havo been In the military or naval service of tho country Ho compliments our Ministers and Consuls abroad. Tho condition of tho Territories Is satis factory, although thu Indian dltllculties in New Mexico are not entirely suppressed. llu alludes to thu mineral wealth of thu new Territories Just discovered. Thu I'resldoiit suggests thu expediency of establishing a system fur the encouragement of foreign emigration. This Is pretty good, cumlng ftoni thu bond ol a party which, fuw years ago, wanted to deny to omlgrauts thu right ot citizenship, If not to forbid llieni coming hero Altogether. Thu l'rusldont compliments the manage ment of tho Treasury. Ho approves tho National llanlclng I,av, but thinks some amendments may be made to It. II ven warmer than his commundatlons of thu Treasury Dupailmunt Is tho pralsu of thu President upon .Mr. Welles, thu Secretary ol the Navy. Ho declares that his duties havo been discharged with fidullty and eminent succuss, Shades of tho Sumter, Alabama and Georgia, what do you think of this ama .lug declaration What do thu merchants thing, whoso ships havo been captured by tho hundred by Confederate privateers, that havu roamed without molestation Lincoln Is butter sutUlled with old Mr. Welles than hu Is with Uhasu, to judge by thu pulling hu bustows 1111011 I1I111. Tho niuasutes of thu last Congress, for thu lumoval of the Indian tribes has boon carried into eirect. Ho suggests thu propriety of change In our Indian system. llu scums to favor a canal being built around tho falls of tho Niagara, on thu American sldu. Thu President next alludes to tho state of feeling at homo and abroad a year ago aud uinv, mid IIiuIh, In his Judgment, a giuat impiovcmcut, as well as in tlio militaiy. status. Ho attributes this change to thu Emancipa tion pioulamatlou and thu employment of negro troops I l,ot us look at that a moment. The proc lamation was, In fact, Issued on tho 'Sim) of September, 'd'.'. In October and November following, the Democrats carried all the eleu Hons, being greatly aided In so doing by thu unpopularity of raid proclamation. Thu par ty of the Piesldeiit has curi'liil tho elections In 18fi;l, but thu I'roclamatlon, so far 1'iom helping to that end, was a drawback upon it. lleforo thu proclamation was issued McClul lan wos within sight uf Richmond, aud we had fought a severe buttle Iu thu centre of Mississippi. Havo wo advanced further in either dlicctiou sineu I ho proclamation was issueiw ihu President claims that of thosu who were slaves at thu beginning of tlio lebellluu, fully onu hundred thousand aro now iu thu Undiid Status military service, about onu half uf whom aro in tho lanUs. So far as tested, thu President thinks tho negroes muku as good soldiers as tho whites. Tho l'lesldnnt then enters Into a defense tho Negro proclamation. He declares that lie will not retract or modify thu proclamation whllo he remains In his present position. The Mesiago, taken us a whole, Is better written than either of Its predecessors, and o miss many ol tho little points that made them so lldtculous and their author so ab surd. Appended to tho Message Is a long nnd strange document called n I'roclamatlon, which beau 111010 thu Impress of Lincoln's peculiar mind aud mode of expression, llu oilers a full paidon to those in rebellion, pro. vlded thoy will lake an oath to faithfully sup port, protect ami defend the Constitution tho United States aud the Union under It, and abide by and support all laws of Congress, ! and all proclamations relative to slavciy, long ns thuy aro not modified or declared void by tho Supremo Ceuil of the United States, ...

Its main object Is not to rostore tho Union, but to abjllsh slavery, and to that end It Imposes upon tho Union men ot tho South tho cmanclpvtion proclamation as a tost, which Is most abhorrent and disgusting to their feelings and ruinous to their Interosls. "The Rich Man's War and the Poor Man's Fight." a The war fioln the beginning has boon op pressivo on poor men. The rich were given olllcos nnd contracts out of which thuy havo amassed princely fortunes, whllo poor men been bavo given muskots, with low wages and tardy pay. Thu price, throe hundred dollars, flxedasthu amount at which oxumpltons from conscription can bo purchased, Is a small matter for rich tnoii; but it Is a heavy burden on tho poor.' It Is probably Impissiblo to give tho poor all thu advantages tho rich posses, but our law-makers should strive to place tho rich and poor as nearly on an equality as possible. This wo havo a right to expect of Congress! but Instead of doing so, that body seems dls posed to still further oppresss fho poor men bv rcneallnit tho three hundred dollar exemption clause in tho Conscription law Its ropoal wilt force all who ln(0 bo conscilp ted, but do not desire to go into tho army, to hire substitutes or go themselves and It requires no argument to provo that substitutes will demand such prices that poor men cannot employ them, whllo tho rich can suvo themselves fiom military duty oy pay ing the price demanded. Instead of raising the price of exemption it should ha lowered. While a much smaller sum than three hundred dollars would servo to exempt poor men who cannot luavo their families, It would raise a fund which, if of fered in bounties, would fill tho army with voluntary soldiers. liesldes reducing tho prico of oxomptlon so as to place It within tho reach of all, ihu pay ot tlio privates should bo Incroasod to twenty flvo or thirty dollars per month. This would bu an additional incontlvu to volun teering, and enable overy soldier to m.vko ample provision for his family. Instead of pursuing n liumano course, nnd ono that would bo acceptable to tho masses, those Iu power soom determined to lord it over and oppress tho pooplo, nnd in pursu ance of that disposition they propose to take away tho lust remedy poor men havo from being dragged from their families under tho most adverso clrcumstuncos. And while thuy would cut oil' thu last liopo from tho poor, thuy would leave the ilcli with thoir abun dance of greenbacks, to purchase substitutes. This has been aptly termed n 11 rich man's war and a poor man's fight," and under thu management of abolitionism it promises to become more so. Reconstruction. a Tho telegraph repoits advices from Hich mnnd, stating that joint resolutions will soon bo Introduced into tbo Confederate Congress in lavor of reconstruction. Lincoln's Message and tho work laid by thu presunt Congress will pretty ullicient ly quiet tlio BoulM'onH wlio lavor a recon struction of thu Union nnd a termination our unhappy national troubles. Judging from what has already boon dono In our Congress that body will knock tho last prop from under those In tho South who tako n stand for tho Union. Adherence to Lincoln's proclamations, re. peal of all laws requiring thu return of fugl tlve slaves, swooping confiscation, disfran chisement and nn amendment to tho Const! tutlon abolishing slavery uvorywhoro, are poor arguments with which to Induce thu people of thu South tt return to tho Union. Ifwo had Washington purged of Abolition ism and unmitigated scoundrullsm, aud thu Government placed In conservative and holiest hands, how quickly our country wo'd rejolco In a restored Union and an enduring peace. When Will the War End! of Some abolition prophets aro predicting tho end of tho war iu ninety days. Ninety years will not seo tho end of It If thu country so long icmuins under the rule of the abolition party. Hut wo have a strong hope it will bo ended In luss than two years Wo expect a Demo crat to bu elected I'rusldunt next November, who will take his seat on tho -Itii of March, Wo also expect a democratic congress to bo elected, and that, Immediately after taking his seat tho President will call his Congress together; that body will ropoal all abolition measures; thu l'rosidunt will nbro. gate all thu abolition proclamations which have omonati'd Irom Lincoln! aud President And Congress will request tho erring South, reus to repeal their oidluances of Secession aud return to tho old Union. These munlfes tatlons of justice end honest purposes will beget a very largo Union paity In all the to- hellions Status, That Union party In thu South will uppual to thu people to rid them selves of tho scourge anil calamities of war, aud accept In Us stead Iho Union as it was In tho days of V.sui.uroN, Jurraisox aud Jackso.x, and with all Us manifold blessings, aud the people will rally uround its standard, and secession will melt away under its Inllu. enco like snow ueder an April sun. Then wu will havo peace and Union. Wo will never have them 'till then.

Supplies for the Prisoners at Richmond. It Is now ascertained that tho supplies for warded to the Union prlsonors are delivered to llieni, and that their condition has been much auielloratod. Blankets, clothing and substantial food only should bo sent, ns tho rebel transportation Is limited and taxed tlio utmost to forward actual necessaries. The arrangements for the distribution of tho supplies forwarded, aro said to bo very good, and as a general thing tho distribution made iu good faith. Since tho above was put in typo tlio robots have declined to receive any further supplies, and assign as their reason for doing so, t hat thu Administration party have Imputed to them dishonesty In tho distribution ot such suppllus. One of the Fruits Of an otllclous press lms just transpired tho action of the rebel Government iu refus ing to receive uny more packages lor Union prisoners. The rebels having boon porslstont- ly charged of lato by radical newspapers nnd radical olllclals villi not delivering, in good faith, the piovlslons sent to the prlsonors, havu resented this imputation upon tbplr honesty by refusing (o receive or deliver any more.
