" A BARBED SHAFT r The story of a thrilling duel of early California days, will be published in \ THE -SUNDAY CALL VOLUME CVn.— NO. IS BELGIANS WILL CROWN ALBERT THEIR MONARCH Prince Will Take the Throne Next Thursday After the Funeral of Leopold Rumor Spreads That Young Son of Baroness Will Claim Right of Accession Dead. Ruler's Will Practically Disinherits the Three Daugh ter He Drove From Court BRUSSELS, Dec. 17.— The entire kingdom of Belgium mourns its departed ruler, Leopold 11. Courts, schools" and theaters are closed, parlia ment and the municipal council have adjourned and flags are at halfmast in every city, town and village of the kingdom. Under the constitution, affairs of the nation are in the control of the cabinet until Prince Albert will take the oath of succession next Thursday, the day after the funeral of his uncle. A contest over the succession to the throne is possible. ; The Vatican is re ported to have confirmed the marriage a year £go of King Leopold and Baron ess Vaii g ha n. Two sons are said to have been born of this union, and both survive. The elder is Lucian, 5 years «li 3. % It is reported he will claim the throne. : Decree Praises King An official decree issued today lauds Kir.g Leopold's career and declares his creation of the Congo independent state was unique in history. "Posterity will judge Leopold a great king with a grand reign," it says. The body of Leopold remains in the mortuary chamber of "The Palms." To morrow night it will be removed to the palace in Brussels. The face of the dead ruler will, not be again ex posed to public view. The filing of the will of King Leo pold today shows that he divided 53,000,000 between his three daughters, Princess Louise, Princess Stephanie and Princess Clementine. This prac tical disinheritance of his children .signalizes, the beginning of a gigantic legal battle to . obtain the king's wealth, similar to that which ensued on the death of their mother. Queen Henrietta. Fortune to Baroness The exast amount of Leopold's for tune probably never wil be revealed. Senator Winer, the king's friend and confidential legal adviser, told the As sociated Press today that Leopold turned over a large portion of it to the Uaroness Vaughan and her children arid created a stock company of his estates to forestall a possible raid upon it by the Princeses Louise and Stephanie or their creditors. Senator Winer said that later per haps large portions of the estate would be given to Belgium. The Princess Clementine, aside from bequests she will receive, is provided for by a special income from Congo property. Senator Winer asserts that the right of the succession to the throne" of a child of the king by the Baroness Vaugha.ri*"is not worthy of serious at tention. He points out that if there were only a religious ceremony laws of the kingdom would prevent the ac cession of a child of such a union. The senator, however, does not believe ther was even a religious marriage. May Be Expelled If it Is eetablished that the Baroness Vaughan is of foreign birth she prob ably will be expelled from Belgium, like the favorite of Leopold I, the Bar oness Mayer, whose house was attacked and destroyed by a mob after the kins'* death. Under the Belgian law a parent is not permitted to bequeath more than a quarter of his belongings away from his children and reports are current to night that counsel for Princess Louise has made the first move toward a legal contest. The court of first instance granted an injunction tonight, sought by the Baroness Vaughan, restraining the au thorities from affixing seals on her resi dence. The action of Princess Louise in attempting to have the seals affixed Is due to her belief that valuable prop erty belonging to King Leopold Is In the villa of the baroness.

Proclamation Delivered Thomas P. Moff at, 'American consul here, delivered the message to Adolfe Diaz, provisional secretary of state, to be forwarded to General Estrada, leader of the revolutionists, and pro visional president at Roma. A copy, of it is being sent also to General Vasquez, leader of the Zelayan forces. The proclamation quotes the letter of Secretary . Knox dismissing .the Nicaraguan - charge d'affaires at Wash ington and then declares that fighting at Bluefields is prohibited because American property and the. lives of Americans would be endangered. The situation at Roma is unchanged. Everybody here is, praying that the American government will recognize General Estrada's government. Plans for Confederation 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.— Plans are afoot, it is believed, for the consum mation of a confederation of the Cen tral American republics. The United States ship Buffalo, now at Panama, with 700 marines on board, has been ordered to Bail at once for Corlnto. . l.: : :- , This action was taken today as the result of a .telegram received from the United States ' consulate at Managua, stating that, inasmuch as Zelaya in his message resigning the presidency had made unpleasant reference to Americans, and owing to a report cur rent in that city that civilian adher ents of Zelaya had been armed with daggers, citizens of the United States there had appealed to , the consulate for protection. Irias May Be President - Another telegram from the Ameri can consulate at Managua says that It is currently rumored there that,' when Madriz arrives in Mangua, presumably tomorrow, Zelaya will formally sur render his office to the National As sembly and that that body already has received instructions from \u25a0 Zelaya to cast its vote for Irias as president of Nicaragua. " • • .This rumor is directly at variance with the understanding that Madriz would receive the support not only of Zelaya himself but of his faction. Zelaya Would Dominate ' The conclusion of the United States officers at Managua is that, by -th« se lection of Irias, Zelaya would still dom inate. Zelaya's change of front is a matter of no surprise here, It being known that both Irias and Madriz have long been regarded as Zelayajs willing tools, and it has been suspected for some time that Irias was really- Zelaya's first choice for the presidency and Madriz second. . * Rear Admiral Kimball, :who, went to Panama on the Dixie, will accompany the marines to Corinto. He will then take command of naval vessels at that port Those now there are the Albany, Yorktown, . Vlcksburg and the;"collier Saturn.. The Princeton is expected to arrive tonight. .

I be lieve, too, in spite of the vigorous and learned opposition to the acquisition of a municipal road at this time, that it' can be operated profitably. "They tell us that we can not makes the interest on the bonds, much less meet principal installments with a municipal line in Geary street in bit ter competition with the existing com panies. They tell us that the people will not patronize a line that serves only a limited territory and can not secure transfer privileges. Will Tap New Territory : V "I answer that, if my memory servea me right, it was demonstrated at the time that the existing arrangement be tween the city and the company was agreed upon, .the company was making about $8,000 v net a month. That will take care of the interest. But in addition to extending the Una proper into ' new territory I would build a cross town line and other feeders.
