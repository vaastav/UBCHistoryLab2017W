In his recent report the Postmaster General says that the nation loses $20, --000,000 a year, and this fact makes the Postal Department report a deficiency annually and prevents its establishing the betterments and enlargements it wishes to and estops the reduction of postage so much desired. Why is there a loss so great? What is the source of this deficit? Why is the Postoffice De partment unable to prevent It? These questions are easily answered, and the replies lay bare the whote im portant matter. There is a loss of $20,000,000 annually, because of the frauds practiced upon the Government in mailing as second-class matter at the pound rate papers and books which ought to go as third-class matter and pay third-ciass rates. Because of these abuses the Postal Department is not self-supporting. If the frauds were crushed out the Department would be self-supporting, and, more, it would yield a revenue to the Government, or enable postage to be reduced to that extent. Second-class matter is paid for at the pound rate of 1 cent. Third-class matter is paid for at the rate of a cent for each two ounces, or fraction. Thus it will be seen that if third-class mat ter is smuggled in at second-class rates the Government is defrauded of 7 cents a pound. But as a matter of fact, the third-class matter because of the "frac tional" charge really pays 14.73 cents a pound, so that the Government loses by reason of the frauds about 13 cents a pound. The frauds which the Postmaster General denounces as "outrageous, monstrous, fungous growth, flagrant evils, perversion and abuse of privilege, etc.," are of three classes, namely, the transmission of paper covered books under the guise that they are period icals. They are dated and numbered, and agents' orders are treated as "sub scriptions;." This class by thousands of tons load up the mails as second class matter, the rate of which was intended only for legitimate, regularly published newspapers having bona fide general subscription lists, and engaged in disseminating news and other in formation. These paper covered books as second class matter constitute an enormous fraud. The Postmaster Gen eral says'of them: Their "consecutive numbering" is a travesty; their Issuance at "stated in tervals" a parody; their "subscription list" a fiction; their claim of being pub lished '"for the dissemination of infor mation of a public character" a bur lesque. There is nothing to distinguish them in substance from bound books, and the discrimination in their favor is most unjust to the publishers of finer literature. The second order of frauds are "house organs" and so-called trade journals, or, as a previous Postmaster General characterized them, "bogus trade jour nals." There are plenty of genuine trade journals, legitimate in all re spects. But the class referred to Is made up of those sheets which are ad vertising circulars only, with a little scissored matter thrown in to give a seeming of "information." These bogus sheets wring in at the second-class rate. The third order of frauds consist of "sample copy" cheats. The law wisely permits a legitimate journal with a reg ular subscription list to send out at second-class rates a sample copy to in duce new subscriptions in a new quar ter. But the frauds cloak a scheme to scatter sheets widely, to multiply dis tribution, solely as the plea and pledge for advertising. The sample copy abuse is the life of the "house organ," a sheet published for no other purpose than to promote the advertising of a single business house; as well it is the life of the spurious trade journal. What the Postmaster General asks, and what his predecessor asked, is leg islation to correct these abuses; to re strict the law to its original purposes. Not only is no assault made by the offi cial upon newspapers and the excep tional postal rate they enjoy, but he expressly insists that the correction of the abuses is in the interest of genuine publications and those originally con templated by the law, for if the wrongs now visited upon the Government by the abuses are not soon corrected the probability is that there will come such sweeping condemnation as will de prive even legitimate papers of their present privileges. Why cannot the Postal Department correct these abuses? Why does it permit matter to rate second 1 class which should pay as third class? Be cause the law is wanting in precision and does not sufficiently guard against the subleties and devices of ttie frauds and imposters. W r hat is asked is that Congress shall by legislation re-estab lish in their proper classification and forbid the privilege of the pound rate to serial libraries of books, to "house organs" and other sheets of an excu- Blve advertising character, to sample editions for advertising purposes, to ad vertising circulars which are masked under the name of fraternal societies, to returns by news agents of unsold periodicals, and to schemes by which publishers pervert their prerogatives by sending matter in their own names at the pound rate for advertisers and pur chasers who have not the privilege. That the proper legislation has not to this time been had, though its need has been frequently pointed out, Is probably due to the influence the fraud ulent publications referred to exercise. They manage to delay the bills intro duced for the purpose and thus far have managed to defeat their passage. It would seem that so strong a pre sentation of the matter as is made by Postmaster General Smith ought to promptly bring from Congress the nec essary clear, well-defined and unam biguous legislation needed. That Gen eral Smith is right in his denounce ments and Justifiable in his demands goes without saying. The amazing thing is that Congress should have so long failed to put on the brakes, where it has so long been made clear to it that the Government is annually defrauded of millions of dollars by perversion of a law from Its intended purposes. A leading Democratic organ says that the reference to the Philippines in the President's message lacks vigor, that he recommends nothing, casts the whole burden upon Congress and is vague and uncertain as to what our policy towards the Filipinos should be. That is simply flagrant misrepressnta tion. It is untruth without a palliat ing line. The President distinctly says that he has no power or authority to determine the form of government for the Philippines; that all he is com missioned and authorized to do is to provide temporary civil government under military supervision. That mean while the authority of the United States will be maintained in the Phil ippines and wherever the flag floats, with all the force and means Congress has placed at his disposal, and that the insurgents will be put down if the en ergy and arms of the American Gov ernment can do it. Is not that spec ific and vigorous enough? Under the Constituiion and the laws what more could the President do? He distinctly states that it is not his province, nor does he deem it wise for him to de clare to Congress the form of govern ment under which the Philippines should be placed. That is the duty and the privilege of Congress alone. He does, however, for its guidance, sketch the form of temporary govern ment which has been established by the military in one of the islands. It was the proper thing to do to report to Congress what has been done in this regard that it may be advised of every step taken in the name and under the flag of the United States. The story comes by cable from Hong kong that the Filipino Junta at that place says Aguinaldo will surrender if Mr. Consul General Wildman is sent to meet him to make the necessary ar rangements. As a rule Hongkong dis patches about the Filipinos, especially those which relate to the expreisions of the Junta, are to be regarded jeal ously, if not wholly repudiated. But assuming the dispatch in question to be verity, what a conception the Junta and Aguinaldo must have of American common sense. Do these fellows think the officers of the Administration are a pack of fools? Is it possible that this much-vaunted man —by the anti txpansionists—Aguinaldo, thinks Amer icans are so stupid as not to see through the trick? The wily Malay wishes to avoid treating with the mil itary, that he may establish the claim that he has had recognition as repre senting a civil government. It will not do. Aguinaldo is in arms against us. In arms he must flee from the archipelago or in arms surrender to the military power now controlling in the name of the United States of America. In that case he will become a prisoner of war, and for his future condition he must trust to the mercy and wisdom of the American Govern ment. The President has certainly put a quietus upon the plan of one branch of the anti-expansionist group, in pointing out that a protectorate over the Philippines would be worse for us than complete abandonment of the archipelago. If we recognize the inde pendence of the so-called Filipino na tion, and extend a protectorate over it, we then become responsible for it and all its acts, but without power to con trol or check the Filipinos in wrong doing. It would, as the President well puts it, place upon us the duty of pro tecting the Filipinos against each other, for that they would soon be engaged in internecine war, the tribal conditions in the Philippines guarantee. | 

ITIE RECORP-U.NIO.N, SACRAMENTO; THURSDAY. DECEMBER 7, 1899. VOICE OF THE PRESS. EXTRACTS FROM EDITORIAL EXPRESSIONS. State and Coast Opinions on Sub jects of Living News Interest. Lassen Advocate: It is believed that there will be more building in Reno next season than there has been during the season that is about to close. Many lots have been sold during the summer and fall to parties who will build and make homes in the town next summer. One party has sold six lots thai will receive structures for homes next year and many other lots have been disposed of for home-making purposes. It is estimated that not less than thirty new buildings will be added to the town within the next year.—Reno Journal. Let the old town boom-j-she can't grow any too big to suit the people up this way. A GOOD SHOWING. Santa Rosa Republican: With a cost ly war on the hands of the Administra tion and all the demands for current expenses to be met, the Secretary of the Treasury is not issuing but buying bonds—not going into debt, but pay ing debts. If this had occurred just preceding an election somebody would certainly have said it was for political effect. It occurs following general elec tions, and is a pure business proposi tion. The opponents of the Dingley bill have assured the people over and over again that there would be a great de ficiency in the national treasury, and that the issue of bonds would be neces sary before the close of this year. Really, this is an instance in which somebody must have been mistaken. SENSELESS ABUSE. Visalia Delta: There is a lot of senseless abuse hurled at a railroad company every time an accident occurs on any part of its system. Some news papers try to persuade the people to believe that the companies are guilty of gross negligence. As a matter of fact, there are no concerns in the world that are operated with such care and precision as are the present-day rail way systems. Even to the minutest details the greatest possible accuracy is demanded by the railway companies of their employes. A HISTORIC PERIOD. Stockton Independent The people of the United States do not yet fully real ize the extent of the industrial and business activity that has revolution ized the conditions of the country in the last two years. The trade reviews make their weekly reports and faith fully record the conditions, making sig nificant comparisons with like periods in former years, but even those who read and study trade reviews fail to appreciate the enormous energies of la ! bor and capital that have set the wheels of development and progress in motion. The country is so large and its pro ductive capacity has become so enor mous and is so generally distributed that it is not only difficult for the aver age mind to grasp the effects of the stimulation, but it is impossible for ex perts to record with exactness the I pulsations of wealth-producing action. ' The people can only content themselves with what they see of the transforma tions until reliable data have been gath ered and presented in annual reports and census figures. Eut whatever the permanence and continuity of the pres ent era of prosperity the histories of j the future will refer to the revival of j 1898 and 1899 as the most remarkable j business revolution in the history of the world. THE DIPLOMATIC LINE. Los Angeles Times: England appears to have been doing some business in the diplomatic line recently which is ex tremely smooth and adroit. She has snuggled up to Germany, succeeded in making France mad, and given Russia something to do which keeps her so busy that the Czar has no time nor in clination to interfere in the contest in Boerland. Britannia plays an exceed ingly good game of cards, and the fel low who has her for a partner may count upon getting away with the first prize. She not only manages to hold strong pasteboards herself, but usually has somebody looking into the other fellow's hand and making signs. When it comes to the matter of diplomacy, the country that euchres England must be expert in dealing cards from the bottom and turning whatever trump is most desired. A TRIVIAL MATTER AT REST. Los Angeles Express: The New York "Herald" says that the Maryland Dem ocrats will lead in an anti-Bryan movement if any encouragment is of fered them by the leaders in New York and other Eastern cities. W T hile it is possible that little Maryland might have had some influence, it is not be lieved that at this time it is possible to do anything to stem the tide of Brj'anism in the Democratic party. It is too late, and the Democratic party must stand by the Nebraska man to the last. The party is committed to him, and they must make the best of it. Aside from other considerations, it is doubtful if any reputable sound money Democrat can be found who will accept the doubtful honor of constitut ing the sacrificial offering. The better informed of the party themselves con cede that they have no show in the election next year, and while they will keep up the pretense of making a fight it will only be- for form's sake. The Democratic party is committed to Bryan, and it must make the best of it. It is just as well. Bryan is used to being sat upon, and one time, more or less, will make no difference. So let the Maryland Democrats have th2ir little fling, if it amuses them. It really cuts no figure with the country at large, anyway. A MATTER OF TASTE. Alameda Argus: We have sometimes debated which is the greater nuisance— the noisy auditors who go to whisper, giggle and generally disturb, or the vi rago on the stage Who stops the play to read them a lecture and set the rest of the audience to hissing- them. Peo ple who do not know enough to behave in any public gathering are exasperat ing and may deserve rebuke and hu miliation, but there is always a sus picion that the actress who administers these before everybody and thus enacts a scene not down on the bills, is seek ing more an ad. than the betterment of the manners of public assemblages. NICKEL-IN-THE-SLOT. Napa Register: The days of the nick el-in-the-slot machine—a machine that cheats—a machine that plays a per centage game—are numbered. It is too sure a thing against the gamble,-. wheth er he be boy or man, to guarantee steady patronage to its owner. Besides it is a violator of the law. To license it is not to protect the operator of it i against prosecution under the statute. In Berkeley the authorities are unani mous in agreeing that it is a nuisance not to be tolerated. In San Francisco, Oakland, Fresno and San Jose, public sentiment is moving against it. The "Mercury" of the last named city says: "One by one the cities of California are passing ordinances that are fatal to the slot machines. It is only a ques tion of a short time when the inhibi tion of this coiTUpting device will be general." NEEDLESSLY ALARMED. San Jose Mercury: Ex-President Cleveland is needlessly alarmed, we think, respecting the dangeryof militar ism. W r hat militarism is, we may see in the history of every European coun try from Rome down; and France just now affords a painful exhibition of its evils in modern times. But because militarism is an evil and a destructive thing does not justify a policy of mil itary weakness and inefficiency. We must not confound the abuses with the uses of military force. So long as our army is limited to the employments that we have for it, we need not be afraid; and certainly an army of ICO, --000 men is not likely to dominate the country nor to disturb the peace-of mind of men of common sense. The reasons which demand a larger army than we have recently had are plain. In the Philippines, in Cuba and Porto Rico considerable forces are needed and will be long to come, while the general increase of our coast defenses calls for more men at home. In increasing the military organization to meet these de mands, we need have no fears of be ing overrun and overridden. THE LEAVEN IS WORKING. Santa Rosa Press-Democrat: The movement of the popular election of United States Senators is moving slow ly, but it is surely moving. At its last session the Legislature of Penn sylvania authorized the appointment of a committee of two Senators and three Representatives to confer with the Legislatures of other States with the view of bringing about the sub mission of an amendment to the Fed eral Constitution for the election of Senators and also of the President and Vice President by popular vote. This committee has just held a meeting in Philadelphia, at which it is announced that communications have been re ceived from the Secretaries cf State of every State in the union except Ar kansas, and that in the Western States particularly there is a strong feeling in favor of electing United States Sena tors by popular vote. It was decided to ask other States to send representa tives with the view of adopting a uniform plan of procedure. There is unquestionably a strong sentiment throughout the country in favor of the election of United States Senators di rectly by the people, and the plan sug gested in Pennsylvania seems likely to concentrate this sentiment into an extremely effective force.

Probably the majority of people sup pose that the observatories obtain the correct time from the sun. When the average man wishes to give his watch the highest praise he says, "It regu lates the sun," not being ay.are that a watch which would keep with the sun around the year would have to be nearly as bad as Sam Weller's. The farmer may safely decide when to go to dinner by the sun, but if the mariner was as confident that the sun marked always the correct time as the farmer is he would be sure to be at times two or three hundred miles from where he thought he was. In other words, .he sun—that is, a sundial —is only correct on a few days in each year, and during the intervening times gets as far as a whole quarter hour fast or slow. These variations of the sun from uni form time caused no end of trouble be tween the astronomers and the iine clockmakers before it was discovered that sun time is subject to such irregu larities. The better the clock, the worse it often seemed to go. But as the variations in sun time are now accurately known, correct time might be obtained from the sun by making proper allowance, were it not for the difficulty of observing its posi tion with sufficient exactness. The large disk of the sun can not be located so perfectly as can the single point which a star makes. For this reason astron omers depend almost wholly upon the stars for obtaining accurate time. It is the method of doing this which we pro pose to describe. There are several hundred stars whose positions have been established with the greatest accuracy by the most careful observations at a number ol the principal observatories of the world. If a star's exact position is known, it can readily be calculated when it will pass the meridian of any given place—that is, the instant it will cross a north and-south line through the place. The data regarding these stars are all pub lished in the nautical almanacs, which are got out by several different obser vatories for the use of navigators and all others who have uses for them. These stars are known as "clock stars." —T. B. Wilson, in Appletons' Popular Science Monthly. Christmas at the White House. The young people in the families of the Cabinet members are always wel come visitors at the White House, and Christmas day is peculiarly the car nival of the children there. Mrs. Mc- Kinley looks forward to this holiday throughout the entire year, making liberal preparation for its celebration. She knits and crochets boudoir shoes, which are presented to men, women and children, although for the latter her favorite gifts are small piec»s of jewelry. It has been estimated that she has made about 4,000 pairs of slip pers, which have given ease and com fort to many weary feet. Her faith ful French maid. Claire, puts the soles on the slippers aa fast as they are completed, and they are then put away against Christmas-tide. Mrs, McKin- ley's favorite color is blue, and she likes to have all her holiday packages ready and tied with blue ribbons, so that on Christmas morning, when the gleeful children come to show her their gifts she adds to their treasures.— Mary Nimnjo Balentine, in Woman's Home Companion.

MTuWTh Paradoxical as it may seem,- the close fellow seldom gets tight. PRESENT DAY THOUGHTS. By "Grosvenor.'- Washington's Self-Forgetf ulness.—ln his youth Washington was a royalist of the royalists, ever delighting to talk of his duty to his King. At 40 he was actively arrayed against the King though every selfish interest would have prompted him to remain quiet. In brief, the change of attitude amounted to this—that he would rather fight for justice than live in peace with dishonor. Washington was slow in making up his mind regarding the contest that was to be, but when once sure of his mind he was willing to risk every acre he con trolled and every dollar that he had. Still waters run deep, and Washington, though not a man of violent oratory, like Patrick Henry, nor of polished rhetoric and scholarly attainment, like Jefferson, risked all when chosen by Congress as Commander-in-Chief, and he would not at any later date admit that the dispute was wrong, or that the method was wrong, or that the outcome was uncertain. Men of boundless en thusiasm at the beginning of the quar rel came and went; the complexion of Congress changed with almost every changing piece of news, jvien who witn great flourishes of ink signed their names to the Declaration of Independ ence, were within a few months bicker ing among themselves and hindering the work of the very man whom they had chosen to lead the American forces. But despite Congressional disputes, un derhand cabals, distresses within the camp or discouragements outside in the country, quiet Washington still held to his purpose. It seems as though it were a blending of the unreasoning ten acity of the English bulldog v,ith the unmoved certainty of a prophet of good who with an eye keener than the eyes of those around him could see through the darkness and the discouragements to a brighter and more perfect day. It is during these eight years that the mature minded Washington takes on his most inspiring form. As a young man he was full of the peculiarities of young men; as President and statesman his way was full of the difficulties that come to greatness. But during these eight years, when, hoping against hope, he led the forlorn, himself forlorn, and working against all sorts of untoward workings, he toiled to build up an army only to see that army meit pway again and then with courage began once? more to toil to the very self-same end, he shows us who know what it is to bear burdens just how much more cour age and self-forgetfulness he had than the average man has. He seems to have become almost impersonal in his feelings, for we cannot deny that the insults to him were many, that the plottings against him were such that the normal impulse would have been to wash his hands of the whole affair and retire to the comfort and peace wimiiMfl IuHOIUmH 1 I For Infants and Children.
