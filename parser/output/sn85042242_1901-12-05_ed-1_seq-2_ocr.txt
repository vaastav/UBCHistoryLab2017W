It has a wide circulation and is desirable advertising medium. Being published at the capital of the state it makes a feature of state news, of a semi­ official character, and Is therefore particu­ larly Interesting to all who desire to keen the run of state affairs—political, social and business. It was throught the Schley-Sampson controversy had been finally disposed of ,bu)t congress seems determined to bring the ghost out for another heat and a resolution has*1 been presented to the house for the investigation of th* conduct of Historian MeClav, who wrote the offensive paragraphs in tho history of the Spanish-American war which resulted in the Schley court of inquiry. The congress of the United States, drawing about $.",00 for daily salary, devoting much of its time in­ vestigating the conduct of Mr. Mc Clay, who -draws, we believe, $1.40 from the naval department, strikes us as descending a little distance into the ridiculous. If the intense partisans of Admiral SchJey are determined to force this matter perpetually upon the public they will do more harm than good. The American people are just about tired enough of this whole mat­ ter to go over on the other side from (the faction that persists in airing it. Let us have peace, as General Grant said—peace anda good long rest from the tiresome Schley-Sampson matter— at least until the .court of inquiry has made its report. Senator Hansbrough has reintro­ duced his irrigation bill. The east, of course, is opposed to any bill which appropriates money for irrigation, al­ though -always willing to vote conces sions to its own favored industries and projects. The president's message favors irrigation and government aid therefor, and if the west will, stand together in congress there is no reason why a beginning should not be mad upon the work of government irriga­ tion. There are millions of acres in the west to be made arable and fertile with proper irrigation. It is entirely proper that the government should aid

The increased produc­ tion of crops, payment of transporta­ tion charges, establishment of broiul acres for new settlers and homes Jor| some of the toiling millions of Ahe east would more than repay thwout lay. Judge Pollock makes a ruling in tax cases which will be off interest.uiiri im­ portance through tlje state, holding that taxes on property which is not assessed to the owner thereof, are il­ legal and void. In the case in point tax certificates were held invalid for the reason that they were based on taxes levied to "unknown." A large number of counties will be affccted bv this decision, if it stands the test o! an appeal to the supreme court, which is to be made. A new stove has been invented for the consumption of soft coal which is said to solve the problem of utilizing bituminous coal for fuel, and also the use of the cheap lignite of the north­ west. "Ceasing to be foreign terri* t.hey became domestic territory," sa the account of the supreme court's re­ cent decision regarding the Philippines. This much is very clear, anyway. Richard Crolcer will retire from the leadership of Tammany, and says he is getting old and worn out. He has also gotten knocked out. President Roosevelt's message does not appear to have pleased the Sit. Paul Globe more, than fairly. AN OLD 

RESIDENT. Mrs. Lucy Kinney in Jamestown Alert: On the 17th of December I will have been a resident of the terri­ tory of Dakota and state of North Da­ kota 31 years. Next to Mr. Mr. Kel ley I am the oldest resident of James­ town now here. We came from Omaha, Neb., on the first train and were three days and nights coming from Fargo. I arrived with two little boys in knee pants. We went on to Bismarck with 100 cavalry from old Port Seward, where I staid for a time, and I was the third woman in Bismarck. There was little or nothing in Fargo at the time we went through. There were plenty of deer, buffalo, Indians and money then. I went east once and stail 'three weeks but didn't like it back there—they were too formal, and I couldn't breathe as well as in this climate, which is a healthy one if nothing else. Have seen some rouigh times in old Dakota, but aim sttill here and in good health, notwithstanding have worked pretty hard about all the time.

While Eulogy speaks, ringing splendid his tone, While Mankind does honor with lowly bowed head, A fradL, broken woman siits there, all alone, Unhealing, save for the dull words— "He is dead." And out of the window, the drear snows mpblown By the winds, white his sepulchre, thick overspread. The mourning of nations steals sad­ ness from death, When Honor and Glory stand guard at the bier, But what shall "restore the sweet warmith of his breath That fanned her wan cheek, when he said "I am near." Oh God, be Thou close, for thy Son's sake, who saith 'For the shorn lamb I temper the wind that is drear.' THE WHY OF IT. We do so many, many things, Because there's money in it," The poet writes, the songstress sings, Because there's money in it," We leave the straight and narrow path, Tempt Earth's rebuke and Heaven's wrath, Nor count the cost or aitermaJth, Because there's money in it," The campaign speaker howls and howls, Because there's money in it," Defiance to the trusts he growls, Because there's money in it," In life, is acted many a sham, The self-same speaker like a claim, Be silent, and not care—a—hem! Because there's money in it," We stifle many noble deeds, Because there's money in it," Nor follow where our conscience leads, Because there's money in it," We fawn, with sycophantic smile, We charge our selfish souls with guile, And beam on those we haite the while, Because there's money in it. In preaching, we are pure, we cry, Because there's money in it, In practice, wink the other eye, Because there's money in it. Our outraged consciences we keep In leash—we soothe our souls to sleep, And plunge into the quagmires deep, Because there's money in it. Lord, now inspire a noble deed, Where there's no money in it, Te&ch me to follow where Thou lead, Tho' there be nothing in it, LADIES' JACKETS. $5.00 Jackets for 7.5o 10.00 12.50 1 5.00 tt EBB 5 ROTH ERS. wwm BISMARC KDAILT TRIBUNE: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1901 S3 1 are $2.50 3.75 5-oo 6.25 ii Child's Jackets Ages 4 to 12 years. $3.50 Jackets, $1.75 2.50 7-50 3-00 3.75 5.00 But the deep grandeur, deep and wide, That to a soul comies, satisfied, That just to do Thy will has tried, And not a dollar in it. S| —FOLEY. BEST ON EABTH SECRETARY M'HAR-G SATISFIED THAT AMERICA IS THE RIGHT PLAGE. Secretary Ormsby McHarg, who re­ turned recently from Europe, says: "We had a very pleasant trip to England, Scotland, Ireland and France the past summer, Arriving in Wash­ ington about the (Jth of November. We visited many noted places, and spemt several months in France, whert I read some French law and got a smattering of the language so that I could get along all right. France is like, a garden, all cultivated outside of the cities. The French people love their land and have no reason to emi­ grate. I was surprised to see so much land in England given up to pas­ turage, as I had an idea that it was about all cultivated except what was held in parks. In the south of Ire­ land it looks like the cftuntry was de­ serted as far as cultivation goes. The exactions of the landlords have about driven the tenants out of that part of the island. "Both on the continent and in the British isles it strikes one that they are behind the times, as compared with America. Our machinery and methods of doing business are far-su­ perior to the old fashioned ways you see there. The tipping system is-a great nuisance, and wealthy Ameri­ cans have spoiled the servants with exorbitant tips for any little service, no matter how trifling. They seem to think that every man who goes there is wealthy and try to get tips accordingly. To learn how much it is customary to pay for the common services a traveler needs, is one of the first things that a'AtTOuger should do to save himsfelf annoyance. "We visited BU^bs1 cdfctage and Shakespeare's birthpl&cxt In the former -We found in his owo hand writ­ ing, a by the late Coi. Ingersoll. It was a fine tribute to the bard of Scotland. At Stratford the natives seem to know very little about he writings of the most cele­ brated Englishman who ever lived.

There iS a much greater opposition to the Boer war in England than is generally believed. "Dublin is a fine city and reminds one of Deibroit, Mich. Paris is the most beautiful city in the world and the cplony of some 8,000 Americans, many of them in business there, seem to take to the cosmopolitan ways with great ease. The lack of regard far what we consider the right views of morals, is seen all over the continent and England, and particularly in Paris. European conditions have de­ veloped a large class of whalt we would call degenerates. In Germany they are noticeably jealous of our trade suc­ cess and the fact that trust made ar­ ticles are sold under the nose of the German manufacturers, is creating a feeling of fear that the extent of this competition has only begun. "There is a national feeling against England not only in France but in Germany, and I saw a cartoon in a German paper that represented John Bull pegging down the island of Eng­ land, with J. P. Morgan coming across the water, and the paper advised that the pegging be made tight or Mr. Morgan would get the island. The feeling in favor of the Boers in Ger­ many amounts to a public demonstra­ tion in the theatres and elsewhere whenever occasion oilers. I return home more of a "howling American" than ever. We have the best coun­ try on earth and I am proud to be an American citizen."
