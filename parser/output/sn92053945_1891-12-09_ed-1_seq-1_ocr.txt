Springer or Holman Likely to Hend the Appropriation and Bland the Coinage Speculations as to Other Chairman ships The Question of Kales Demo cratic National Committee to Meet Jan. 21 Resume of Senate and House Proceedings The Anti-Sub-Treasary Men Official Notes. Washington-, Dec. 9. As soon as the speakership contest had been settled the members began to speculate as to the probable formation of the hoiice commit tees by Speaker Crisp. As Mills was the chief competitor of Crisp for the speaker ship, the chairmanship of the ways and means committee will probably be ajjain offered to the Texas member, though if s-me of the ardent supporters of the suc cessful candidate could have their way it is said they would recommend tbe.'appoint ment of a northern man as the head of the most important committee of the house. The Other Southern Members. It is generally conceded that McMillin of Tennessee, Breckinridge of Arkansas, "Wilson of West Virginia, and Turner of Georgia, will be the southern men likeiy to-in part compose the ways and means committee, but it is possible that one of these may be dropped should Mills be come the chairman, and by virlue of the position, leader of his party on the floor. Tho first committee to be named by the speaker will be that on rules. It is thought that Springer of Illinois, or IIol mau of Indiana, will I one of the mem bers of this committee, Kither Mills or McMillin will likely be another Demo cratic member of the committee. What the Kules Committee May Do. It is conceded that ex-Speaker Reed will be one of the Republican members of the committee on rules and either Bur rows of Michigan or Henderson of Iowa will stand a fair chance of being named. The speaker will of course be the other member of the rules committee. The talk as to changes in the rules is such that at this early stage no one can say what may be done. The prevailing sentiment among Democrats is that tne party lead ers will favor a return to a code some thing like that which governed the body when the Democrats were last in power. Speculations as to Chairmanships. There is some talk of either Springer or Holman for the chairmanship of the ap propriations committee. Other specula tions include the following chairmanships of leading house committees: Agriculture, Hatch: postoflices and post- roHds, Hlount of tleorsia; naval itffairs. Her bert of Alabama; public lands, Holman of Indiana, or McK.ic of Arknnsas; invalid jk-c-sions. Martin of Indiana; fori ik" affair. Mc creary of Kentucky, or t'hijunaii of Michigan; libor, Tarsuey of Missouri, or Shivcly of ln- linria. The chairmanship of the committee on coinage will be carefully considered, but the talk is that the speaker will probably again appoint Bland. In Senate and House.

DEADLY CRASH. ANTI-SUB TREASURY ALLIANCE. Its National Convention Indefinitely Postponed by Keiuest. Washington, Djc. 9. W. S. McAllis ter, of Mississippi, cnatrman ot tue na tional executive committee of the ami sub-treasury Alliance, who has been mak ing a tour of the states where his party is strongest, found awaiting him ujion his return to Washington letters from his fellow committeemen requesting him to postpone the dat for a convention called to meet at Memphis, Tcnn., Dec In. The call was issued from Indianapolis after a long debate upon the refusal of the Alliance supreme council to receive the protest of the anti-sub-treasury party. It had previously been determined, in the event of such action by the supreme conn cil, to perfect a distinct organization with e object of "restoring the rarmers Alii' aca to its original state of fidelity to its coustitution. Waiting on the National Alliance. The request was acted on by Chairman McAllister, who last night issued a no tice to members of the anti-sub-treasury Alliances, informing them that "in obe dience to urgent requests from many members of the anti-mb-treasury Alii ance. the convention called to meet at Memphis, Tenn., Dec 6, is hereby post' poned to a date to be hereafter deter mined." The reasons given for this action by Mr. McAllister are these When the call was issued the supreme council had taken no action on the third party qnestion. Subsequently it an pointed ten ty-flve delegates to the third party conference set lor i-eb. J.1 at St. Louis, Mo. Notwithstanding this action the national Alliance leaders are denying that it is their purpose to turn the farm ers' Alliance into a political party. The result of the St. Louis convention will de termine their purpose in rtie premises hence the propriety of postponing our na tional convention." The Democratic Executive.
