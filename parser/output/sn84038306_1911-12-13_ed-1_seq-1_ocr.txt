Editors Democrat: I will write you some about our trip to the land of sunshine and it Is certainly correctly named for the sun has shone here every day since we arrlvd October 19th with the thermometer nearly all the time In the day 70 to 80 aboev. zero, but the nights are cool usually about 50 above. The day we arrived in Oma ha tjiere was a ten day street carni val being held and' the city was decorated beautifully. At Denver we staid two days and rode all over the city. It Is called the city of homes' for it is said 70 per cent of the working class own their homes and their wide streets and fine lawns make It a beautiful city. Cheese ma a Park 500 feet above the city gave us a very fine view of the whole city and surrounding country. We could see ranges of mountains guide tod us were 80 miles away well covered with snow. There are 27 mountains in Colorado higher than Pike.* Peak. We were in Colorado Springs two days and visited Mana tou, where the four springs, attract hundreds of visitors "every day. There are two iron, one sulphur and one soda spring. From there we went through the Garden of the Gods that wonderful formation of rooks. We visited South, Cheyenne canyon and went to Inspiration Point, the trail to Helen Hunt Jackson's grave, the place where she finished' her writ ing. We climbed the mountain steps about 500- feet and saw all of the noted seven falls one above the oth er. Helen Hunt Jackson's husband re tired October 1,1911 and gave his six children one million dollars., each. In .passing through the wonderful Royal gorge we rode In an open observa tion car and the varjous formation of rocks is one of grandeur that can not be appreciated unless seen. We staid In Glen wood Springs only one day and visited the springs, the principal one being the hot sulphur spring that throws out a large it ream, of .boiling hot water all the time while only a few feet away an other spring has sparkling cold wa ter. From here we went to Salt Lake and during the day passed through a desert of over 100 miles where scarce ly any green shruibe or trees are seen In aSlt -Lake we staid two days and rode to all points of Interest, visited the temple and' tabernacle and also attended the organi recital. The tabernacle seats 8,000 people and the organ has. 5500 pipes, the smallest one 1-2 Inch and largest 32 feet and produces the finest music wo ever heard. The streets laid ouit In 1847 by Bingham Yo nng are 130 ""feet arife and the Modes contain 10 acres each and they have one street 22 miles long straight as an arrow. The streets are swept and washed every day and for beauty and cleallnness Is the finest city I ever visited. They have some very fine -buildings Hotel Utah built of pure white marble cost two million dollars. 'We were at the hotel where Horace Greeley made that famous speech and advised young men to go west. We visited the famous Soltalr Beach pavlllion built out in great Salt Lake nearly one mile. They have the largest dancing hall in tiie world 140x250 feet and one restaurant that seats, one thousand persons at one time. The amusements are about the same as White City Chicago. From here we went to Sacramento and rode through great Salt Lake for many miles and tlhen we passed over the Sierra Mountains where the scenery was-^ beautiful all- the way and so many small lakes to be seen on the top of mountains. Here we passed through 40 miles of snow sheds. We also passed that wonderful spouting spring, where water Is throwm per pendicular nearly 100 feet high. In Sacramento we rode all over the city and It contains such beautiful shrubs flowers and .palm tress that it makes an ideal city. Here we had our first fresh strawberries this winter and have had them nearly every day since. We went to San .Francisco and staid two days and visited1 all points of Interest. We went to Golden Gate park that contains 1018 vacres and over 3000 different varieties Of trees. We also visited Cliff House, Terrace on the Pacific coast, where the famous seal rocks are near ahore audi so many seals make thelr home. San Francisco has very narrow streetsi and is very hilly, some streets are so steep, one street car isp ull ed up the hill by the one coming down. Then we went to Santa Bar bara we visited them isslon-and the by the Pacific ocean. At Santa Bar bar we visited tihe mission and the guide took us all through the build ings and grounds. Santa Barbara is quite a resort- for eastern people. The next day we came to Pasadna, Call forni, our home for the winter and have enjoyed the climate very much. We can sit out In our front yard ev ery-day with comfort in our summer clothes. We have green vegetables and berries of all kinds gvery day as we have In Iowa during ttoe sum mer time. I hope this will not weary your patience but I wanted to write you something of what a fine trip we had. A. H. Blake. MARRIAGE LICENSES.
