DAKOTA COUNTY HERALD: DAKOTA CITY, NEBRASKA. WILSON'S MESSA TO THE CQNGRE Senate and House in Joint Ses sion Hear Address of . the President. HE HAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS f Further Legislation for Settlement and 1 Regulation of Railway Labor DIs- putcc Held Imperatively Neces sary by the chief Magistrate. Washington, Doc. G. The senate and house met In Joint session today and heard President Wilson's message, which was as follows t Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty lnld upou me by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to tlmo Information of tho state of tho Union and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures as may ho judged necessary and expedient I shull continue tho practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of tho several heads of the executive departments tho elaboration of tho detailed needs of the public sen Ice and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which It seems neces sary und feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible; but there were some things left undone at the last session . which there will now be time to complete and which It seems necessary in tho Interest of the public to do at once. In the first place, It seems to me Im peratively necessary that tho earliest possible consideration and nctlou should be nccorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at tho close of your last session In view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended: First, Immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of tho Interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In tho bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now nwalting action by the senate; In order that tho commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and vnrious duties now devolving upon it with a prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with Its present constitution nnd means of action, practically Impossible. Second, tho establishment of nn 1 eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages In the employ ment of all railway employees who arc actually engaged in the wojk of oper ating trains In Interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of n small body of men to observe tho nctual re sults In experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day In railway trans portation nllko for tho men nnd for tho railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by tho con gress of the consideration by the In terstate commerce commission of an Increase of freight rntes to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the ndoptlon of the eight hour day nnd which have not been off set by administrative readjustments nd economies, should the facts dis closed justify tho Increase. Fifth, an amendment of tho existing federal stntuto which provides for the mediation, conciliation, nud arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to It a provision that, In case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public Investigation of tho merits of every such dispute shall be Instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment In the hands of the executive of the power, In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions nnd such roll ing stock of tho railroads of the coun try us may bo required for military uxi and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative ofilcluls as tho circumstances require for their snfe and efficient use. Renews His Recommeroationo. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress Immediate ly acted on: It established tho eight hour day us tho legal basis of work, and wages In train service and It au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately needed; Unusual Experience. "Man," remarked Sandy, ""I did a thing Inst nicht what I've no dune this twenty year. I went to inn bed palrr fectly sober, but I'm rlcht thankful to say I got up this mornln' none the wnur !" Few Beggars In Panama. Although the city of Panama Is n most cosmopolitan place, practically every race being represented In Its 60, 000 Inhabitants, there nre no beggars, except n few blind men. but it postponed action upon tho other suggestions until nn opportunity should bo offered for n more deliberate con sideration of them. Tho fourth rec ommendation I do not deem It neces sary to renew. The power of the In terstate commerce commission to grant nn Increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is Indisputably clear and n recommendation by the congress with regnrd to such a matter might seem to draw In question the scope of the com mission's authority or its Inclination to do justlco when there Is no renson to doubt either. The other suggestions the Increase In tho Interstate commerce commis sion's membership nnd In Its fncllltles for performing Us manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation nnd assessment of industrial disputes, nnd tho grant to the executive of tho power to control nnd operate the rail ways when necessary in tlmo of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have lutrimtcd us with tho responsibility and duty of serving nnil safeguarding them In such matters would find It hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon there grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of notion upon them. Not only does the Interstate com merce coinndsston now find it practi cally Impossible, with Its present mem bership and organization, to perform Its grent functions promptly and thor oughly, but it Is not unlikely that it may presently bo found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first bo perfected as an administrative instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which tho con gress can easily and promptly supply. And nil will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they nre needed. This Is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which nrgues its own case In tlfe mere statement of It. With regard to one of It Items, tho Increase In the effi ciency of the interstate commerce com mission, the houso of representatives has already acted ; its action needs only the concurrence of the sennte. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare sny the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion shoiild I make It, that any man In any occupa tion should bo obliged by law to con tinue In nn employment which he de sired to leave. To pass u law which forbade or prevented tho individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the npprovnl of society In do ing so would bo to adopt a new prin ciple Into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we nre not prepared to Introduce. But the proposul that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or Inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public Investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question nt Issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of tho nntlon Is not to propose any such principle. It Is based upon the very different principle that tho con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not bo permitted to stop the In dustrial processes of the nntlon, nt any rate before the nation shnll have had nn opportunity to acquaint Itself with tho merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, tlmo to form Its opinion upon an Impartial statement of the merits, nnd opportunity to con sider nil practicable menus of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessnry processes of Its very life. There is 'nothing arbi trary or unjust In it unless It be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and should bo done with a full and scrupu lous regard for tho Interests and liber ties of all concerned ns well as for the permanent Interests of society Itself. Other Legislation Urged! Three matters of capital importance await tho action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: tho bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged In pro moting the foreign commerce of tho country than Is now thought by some to be legnl under the terms of tho laws against monopoly; tho Mil nmeudlng the present organic law of Porto Rico ; and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of tho expenditure of money In elections, com monly called tho Corrupt Practices Act. I need not lnbor my advlco that these measures be enucted Into law. Their urgency lies in tho manifest clrcum stances which render their adoption nt this time not only opportune but neces sary. Even delny would seriously jeopard the Interests of the countrj and of tho government. Immediate passage of tho bill to rcg- Most Fishermen Have Done It. "Simple pinion went n-flshing in his mother's pail." "Not so simple, nt that," declared tho amateur sportsman. "I've spent time and money getting to n place where the likelihood of catching fish was no whit greater." Nothing New. "I seo some scientific sharp has dis covered a substitute for bread." "Ho needn't think he's so much. Our cook lias been turning that out for years." ulate the expendtturo of money In clec tlons may seem to bo loss necessnry than tho Immedlnto enactment of tho other mensuriH to which I refer; be couso nt least two years will elapso before another election In which fed eral otllces are to be filled ; but It would grently relievo the public mind If this important mntter were dealt with while the circumstances nnd the dun gcrs to the public morals of tho pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and tho methods of expenditure can bo frankly studied In tho light of present experience; nnd n delay would have tho further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand nnd some special object connected with it might be thought to be In the mind of those who urged it. Action can bo taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion ofpartlsnn purpose. I shall not argue nt-length the desir ability of giving a freer hahdjn tho matter of combined und concerted ef fort to those who shall undertnko tho essential enterprise of building nip our export trade. That ontcrprlso will presently, will Immcdlntely assume, has Indeed already nssutned, n magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not tho necessary instrumen talities for Its prosecution; It Is deemed to bo doubtful whether they could bo created upon nn adequate scale under our present laws. Wo should clear away nil legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for It which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. Tho thing must be done now, because tho .opportunity Is here and may escape us if wo hesitate or delay. Porto Rlco'6 Needs. The argument for the proposed nmendments of tho organic law of Por to Ulco Is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the Island und rcgulntlng the lights and privileges of Its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which wo have not satisfied. There Is uneasiness among tho people of tho Island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do In any essentinl particular. Wo ought to do It at once. There are other matters iiU-endy ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween tho two houses of which It Is not necessnry that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found nnd action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion 1 shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you In tho many meifsures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched tho legislative nnnalsof the country. It has been a privilege to lnbor In such company. I trtke tho liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of n record of rare servlcoableno,ss and distinction. Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite. Instead of nn nx und saw to remove the tops of trees that nre to bo used as masts In logging operations, dyna mite Is used to shoot off the tops After tho branches have been removed, a rigger climbs the tree, with a set of Irons, to the point where It Is npces sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk Is usually about 12 Inches In diame ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna mite cartridges, fastened end to end like sausages, around tho trunk nt this point, inserts a blasting cap with about 20 feet of fuse In one of those sticks, lights tho end of the fuse, nnd de scends beforo tho explosion takes place. Tho tree top pumps Into tho air with tho explosion und tho trunk is left ready for attaching the rigging for dragging in nnd loudlng the logs. Engineering Record. All He Saw of Battle. Tho bluejacket hud been in the bat tle off Jutland, nnd In the railway com purtment every ono addressed him re spectfully. Incidentally ho was tho reclpleht of numerous fine cigars, no conducted himself with becoming dig nity, and when tho foreign-looking gen tlemnn who lind kept silent went out nt a roadside station tho audlenco set tled down to' hear the yarn. Nodding his head toward the durk stranger on the platform, the bluejacket remarked with a grin, " '13 thinks 'e 'as lost somc thlnk Vd like to hear, 'e 'as.

"Now, these fushlonnble dames don't mind talking freely about the efforts they make to reduce weight." "That's true."
