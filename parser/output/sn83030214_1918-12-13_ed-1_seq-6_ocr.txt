New Invention Revolutionizes Wire Service Five Telephone or Forty Telegraph Messages on One Circuit Is Possible One System Now Working Theodore N. Vail Reports Sensational Results of Multiplex Method Tests WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.- Postmaster General Burleson to-day made public a letter from Theodore N. Vail, presi? dent of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, announcing the invention and development by the tech? nical staff of the Bell system of "a practical system of multiplex tele? phony and telegraphy by the use of which it is now possible to increase nianyfold the message-carrying ca? pacity of long-distance telephone and telegraph wires." "With this new system," said Mr. ?V'nil's letter, "four telephone conver? sations over one pair of wires are - simultaneously carried on, in addition < to che telephone conversation provided by t'ne ordinary methods. Thus over a single pair of wires a total of five telephone conversations are simultane? ously operated, each giving service as good as that provided by the circuit working in the ordinary way. "A number of years ago we devel? oped the 'phantom circuit' arrangement by which three telephone circuits are -obtained from two pairs of wires. Now by our multiplex methods we%are en? abled to obtain five telephone circuits over one pair of wires; that is, ten simultaneous telephone conversations from two pairs of wires which former? ly could be used for only three simul? taneous telephone conversations. "In telegraphy as well as in tele ? phony, sensational result? have been . attained by the new system. By com 'bining two telegraph wires into a metallic circuit of the type used for telephone working and by applying our 'new apparatus and methods to this metallic circuit we have enormously increased the capacity of the wires for telegraph message:? without in any way impairing the quality of telegraph working. "The nature of these developments is such that, if desired, wires may be used partly for telephone and partly for telegraph. A pair of wires is avail? able either for five simultaneous tele? phone conversations or for forty simul? taneous telegraph messages, or partly for one and partly for the other. "From the nature of the apparatus and the methods employed the system is not practically advantageous on short 1 lines, either telephone or telegraph. On long lines its application will be ex? tended immediately, but its introduc? tion must necessarily be gradual on ac? count of the nature of the apparatus required and the rearrangement and adaptation of the lines themselves and their associated apparatus to the new methods of working. "It is not too much to characterize this new system as marking an epoch in the development of long distance telephony and telegraphy." Mr. Vail said that an installation of the multiplex telephone system be? tween Baltimore and Pittsburgh had been in service for more than a month. "On Monday of this week," he said, "accompanied by a party of distin? guished government and telephone and telegraph officials, I made an inspec? tion of the system of Baltimore and a ?test of the service provided between Baltimore and Pittsburgh. All of the fparty were delighted with the success? ful working of the new system and the evident skill which had been shown in developing it."

"They should bc# returned to their owners af? ter necessary legislation has been en? acted." Senator Pomerene, & prominent Democrat of the Interstate Commerce Committee, and perhaps one of the most progressive Democrats in the up? per House, made the following: pointed observation: _ "I lire in Ohio, but on this question I come from Missouri." Smith in Fighting Mood Chairman Ellison D. Smith of the Interstate Commerce Committee, which handles nil legislation pertaining to railroads, called a meeting of his com? mittee for next Thursday to take up the question. In conversations with his colleagues he voiced hot opposition to Mr. McAdoo's five-year proposal. Some of his fellow Senators said the chairman would be found by the Ad? ministration to be far from the com? plaisant, and obedient servant ho bad proved during the war. One Senator said to-night he had talked to almost one-half of the mem? bers of. the Senate, with the result that he found one man who favored the McAdoo plan and four who were non-committal, all the remainder be? ing opposed to it. A diligent search at once instituted by a group of news? paper men, however, failed to smoke out the one who openly favored the five-year plan. Senator LaFollette said he did not wish to say anything at this time, but that he would make a speech on the subject in the near future. Solution Up to Congress The general disposition in the two houses seems to be that both the Presi? dent and Mr. McAdoo have now threat? ened the speedy return of the railroads unless there is Congressional action, and that it is up to Congress to work out the problem?not in the short ses? sion which expires on March 4, but with careful consideration during the next two years. It is fully realized that under the law the President can return the roads to their owners at any time, without even waiting until the peace treaty is signed, if he should so elect. It is not be? lieved, however, that the President would take the responsibility for the consequences which might follow the return of the roads under the old con? ditions when he knew Congress was working out a permanent solution. In short, it is not believed on Capitol Hill that Mr. McAdoo will be permitted to carry out what was generally termed by Senators and Representatives to-day his threat, or even that he would be willing to take the responsibility it* tho President should permit him to do so. It is the conviction of such men as Oscar W. Underwood, of Alabama, for instance, that Congress should work out the problem with care and study, hearing all sides at length before the committee, so that justice could be done to all. Pressure by Shippers The pressure from the country on the matter cornea from various sources, judging from the mail which floods into Washington. The most strenuous insistence that the roads should be returned to their private owners comes not from the owners themselves, apparently, but from the shippers. Representatives of the shippers be? lieve that with the return of the roads to their private owners it will be pos? sible to force a reduction of the freight rates, taking off the 15 per cent horizontal increase put on by Mr. Mc? Adoo to compensate the government for the wage increases he granted. While there is a general clamor for the reduction of the passenger fare increases, this is not so well organ? ized or represented as are the advo? cates of a reduction in freight rates. The pressure for a continuance of the present system, or permanent gov? ernment operation, comes chiefly from the railroad employes, who believe that that they will receive higher wages from the government, or under the present hybrid system, than they would from private owners in a period in which it is possible that prices may be declining. * Stockholders Not a Unit The pressure from the railroad stock? holders, according to Senators and Rep? resentatives, is not nearly so insistent as that of either the shippers or em? ployes. This is because the stockhold? ers are not a unit. Many of them whose views have been set forth in letters favor the return of the roads to their owners as speedily as possible, but, of course, the stockholders are more in I terested in the conditions under which I the roads may be returned. Aside from the opposition to the ] actual proposal, there were many criti ' cisms of the announcement that the ! President favored the five-year test j period, following so quickly on his own ! statement to Congress that he sub I mitted this problem to Congress for its I counsel, having no solution oT his own. Senator Townsend, of Michigan, was j one who characterized this as a "clear | manifestation of duplicity." Other Senators expressed themselves i as follows: Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania? | "I am opposed to the proposal of Mr. j McAdoo. As he is retiring from tho ? department I do not see that his opin ? ion should be entitled to any consider ? ation. In my opinion he has brought | about such a state of utter demorali? zation on the railroads and expresa companies that he has .set the cause of government ownership back fifty years. I am in receipt of letters from men whose business necessitates their shipping, many packages of merchan j dise by express, telling me that when ; their packages are lost nowadays they | cannot even get an acknowledgment of I their Complaints addressed to the ?Director General of Railroads" i "Does your statement that McAdoo's I demoralization of the railroads has set the cause back fifty years mean that you think government owiership will bo an improvement when it does come?" Senator Penrose was asked. I "I said it would set the cause back fifty years. I meant that it would not be brought up for fifty years. We will all be dead by that time." Senator Underwood, of Alabama I am holding my mind open as best I can until the committee, which will meet on Thursday, ?nus given both sides a hearing. It think it would be very difficult unless a virtually unani? mous agreement should be reached in the Senate as to what should be done with the railroads, so that there would be on debate, to get any railroad legis? lation at this session. However, while the President has the power to turn the railroads back to their private own? ers at any time, I take the view that we have at least two years in which to decide this problem, and that should be ample. I think there should be legislation, even if the railroads are to be turned back to their owners. Senator Borah, of Idaho. "I am op? posed to the proposition. The present situation is unbearable. It is neither public ownership nor private owner? ship. It. is private ownership publicly controlled, with profits guaranteed, the most vicious kind of ownership of which the mind could conceive. Five years mere of il, we would have a wrecked and wholly worthless transpor? tation system and nothing to show for it except a huge public debt for the taxpayers to take care of. Lot determine whether we are going to have public ownership or private ownership. If the former, provide the machinery and take it. as nearly as we can out of party politics. If we are going back to private ownership, let's go as soon as possible. In other words, postponement is disastrous in my judgment." Senator Townsend, of Michigan?"It is an impossible proposition. It bears no evidence of sincerity. Secretary McAdoo's quotation of the President, favoring this scheme, coming immedi? ately after the President's assurance to Congress that he had no views on the subject, is a clear manifestation of du? plicity. "The proposal suggests, if it does not make directly, a threat to throw the railronds back upon their owners without affording any opportunity to adjust themselves to changed condi? tions. To do this would be harmful in the t*xtreme. But while it will take some time to work not m detail an effective plan for railroad reorganiza? tion and operation, there is ample time to accomplish this in the twenty-one months which the law permits the gov- ! eminent to retain possession of the roads. I "It is not at all necessary to extend ? the time for consideration of the prob- j lems beyond the period already pro- ! vided if a sincere effort is made to deal i with the question. To attempt legis- ] lation in tht three months of this ses- i sion would be an absurdity. The or-I 1 derly way to proceed is to have the matter taken up at the earliest pos I sible date with a view to ?settling the I whole matter wthin the time limit pro i vided in the present law." ? I Railroad Executives Call Rail Control Proposal Harmful 

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 12.?-Railroad ! executives representing 126 roads and 02 per cent of the mileage of the coun? try to-night gave out a formal state? ment in which they declared that Director General McAdoo's suggestion that the government reain control of the railroads until January, 1924, "would simply lead to delay and con? fusion, demoralization of the organi I zation of the roads both on their cor I porate and operating side and defer in i definitely a satisfactory settlement" of | the railroad oroblem. | The executives, the statement said, ' have reached the conclusion that | "there is sufficient time under the j term of the present act to fully con ! side?; the railroad situation in all its aspects and arrive at ;i plan that would ? be just to the country." Various Problems Considered The statement was given out bv Thomas De Witt Cuyler, Philadelphia, 1 chairman of the Railway Executives j Advisory Committee, now known as i the Association of Railway Executives. The association is considering prob ! lems that will arise in connection with ) the return of the railroad properties : to their private owners. The statement follows: "The standing committee of the As | sociation of Railway Executives have j considered the letter of the Director General to the chairman of the Inter I state Commerce Committees of the Sen I ate and House, and have reached the I conclusion that there is sufficient time under the term of the present act to fully consider the railroad situation in all its aspects and to arrive at a plan that would be just to the country as represented by its shippers and the public at large and, on the other hand, to the security holders and sharehold? ers and emo'oyes of the railroads. Wilson's Statement Quoted "They are in full accord with the President in his statement, as follows: " 'The one conclusion that I am ready to state with confidence is that it would be a dis-service alike to the country and to the owners of the railroads to return to the old conditions unmodified. These are conditions of restraint with? out development. There is nothing af? firmative or helpful about them. What the country chiefly neds is that all these means of transportation should be developed?its railways, its water? ways, its highways and its countryside ronds. Some new element of policy is tnerefore necessary for the service of the public, necessary for the release of credit to those who are administering the railways, necessary for the protec? tion of their security holders. The old j policy may be changed much or little, I but surely it cannot always be left as | it was. I hope that the Congress will ? have a complete and impartial study of the whole problem instituted at once \ and prosecuted as rapidly as possible.'" Consider Extension Unwise j "They feel that to at present extend the time would simply lead to delav land confusion, demoralization of the i organization of the roads, both on ! their corporate and operating side, and : defer indefinitely a satisfactory set I tlement of this great problem. I. "They regret to differ with the Di : rector General, recognizing the able j way he has managed the roads during l the period of government control, but | they feel confident that it would be j unnecessary and unwise to extend the ! period of control beyond the time now j provided for under the act." McAdoo Is Accused in Many Quarters Of "Playing Politics" Director General McAdoo's proposal ! to extend the period of government j control of the railroads to five years I or more aroused widespread opposition j among leading bankers and railroad men yesterday. The charge of "playing politics" was heard in many quarters. The majority of banking opinion recommended a continuance of the present method of control for the period of twenty-one months provided under the existing legislation. "If the problem of future control of the railroads cannot be worked out in? side of a year and nine months," said a Wail Street banker, "it cannot be solved in five years, or in ten years. Other bankers expressed similar views. Although the publication ?? the Di? rector General's recommendations took most people in the Street by surprise, bankers and railroad officials apparent? ly knew in advance what was coming. It developed yesterday that 'only a few days ago certain railroad executives and bankers were hurriedly summoned to Washington and told that unless they supported a plan for the exten? sion of government, control for a be thrust back into their hands by March 1. At that time the proposals were characterized as extremely unfair, and period of live years the roads would it is understood that the railroad ad? ministration was informed that its pro? gramme would be strongljf opposed. Director General McAdoo was also told, it was reported yesterday, that, the re? turn of the roads to private ownership j by March I would result, in receiver ? ship for many of the weaker proper? ties. ? As to the roads being continued un \ der government control for a period of five years, it was held that this prob? ably would mean government owner sh?p in tho end. Newman Erb, president of the Ann Arbor Railroad, was one of the few railway executives who approved yes? terday the recommendation of the Di \ rector General. lie was the only one of those present at last week's meet? ing under the auspices of the railway ; executives' advisory committee to vote "no" on the resolution favoring the return of the roads to private owner? ship under a system of modified gov? ernment regulation. Wanted Project Tested In explaining why he had voted in the negative Mr. Erb said that he, as well as the others at that gathering, had learned that Mr. McAdoo was about to launch his proposal and that he pre? ferred a fair test of Government own? ership rather than have the transpor? tation companies returned to their owners on the basis existing prior to the war. He added: "My belief is that pooling is an antique and archaic method of dealing j with the railroad traffic. Two better j alternatives, which President Wilson j referred to in his recent message to I Congress, are government ownership | or a rigional Federal railway system i under private ownership. I "Mr. McAdoo desires to afford suffi j cient time to experiment thoroughly ! the plan of government operating con ? trol. I believe that to be wise. Such : control under war conditions affords ! no correct basis for a proper judg ! ment, nor are two years sufficient i time for that purpose. Five years will '?. afford the necessary time to indicate ! what is best for the public, labor and ?railroad investors, and to point the | way for conservative, and constructive | legislation. "If it should be deemed wise then to return the railroads to private ownership sufficient time will have been allowed for ample protection of the investor and the public." To Stick to Course 

BALTIMORE, Dec. 12. -H. Davies Warfield, president of the National As? sociation of Owners of Railroad Se? curities, when asked here what would ? be the position of the association in ; view of Director General McAdoo's let? ter to Congress asking that the time i for the return of the railroads be ex ! tended for live years, said: "The position taken in respect to the : return of the railroads has been re i cently announced in two statements in ! the press. Nothing in the present sit | nation alters the course then dcter : mined upon, so far as I can se. "This association does not propose j precipitate action. Every one realizes the importance of this subject, and it is the purpose of the association, prior to presenting any suggestions it may j formulate to the Congress, to consult with committees, organizations and ' others concerned, including shippers, j that unity of thought may be secured if possible. The Federal control act pro i vides twenty-one months from the for ? mal announcement of peace for the re I turn of these'properties, therefore Con? gress, which is, after all, the body that | will settle this question, provided itself j with abundant time to mature plans i for their proper return under strict j and comprehensive plans for govern j mental regulation. We have faith in the Congress that it will see that when ; the railroads r.re returned within the ; time specified by the Federal control act, it will be done under plans fair alike to the shipper, the , travelling public, labor and to the security own i ers, and we have equal faith in the rail ? load administration that they will give j the Congress sufficient time for work i ing them out." ?-1-? | Lawyer, Fund Aid, Is Fined J.

Public Lands for Soldiers Urged by Secretary Wilson Their Colonization, Along j With Sailors, Is Favored; by Head of Labor Depart- j ment in Annual Report j WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.?Coloniza? tion by returned soldiers and sailors of large tracts of land under the di? rection and with the aid of tho Fed? eral government is recommended as a solution of many of the labor prob? lems arising from demobilization by Secretary of Labor Wilson in his an? nual report, made; public to-day. The government should, in the opinion of I Mr. Wilson, establish and equip indi? vidual farms, which would be linked into community groups. The war has demonstrated the pa- ? triotism and loyalty of American; labor, the report says, and in the con tinuance of the "spirit of sacrifice" j on the part of employer and employe j shown during the war, Secretary Wil- ? son believes, "lies the hope for the further attainment and development during the days of peace of that de? mocracy for which we have taken up arms." The right, of collective bargaining, j long recognized by the Department of j Labor, Secretary Wilson declares, has been more widely established by rea- . son of the war. He adds that "if the ? principles upon which that agreement ? was founded can endure the stress of j war, it is fair to suppose that even i greater success will attend their ap? plication during the calmer periods of peace." To solve the labor problem arising from reconstruction, Mr. Wilson rec? ommends the continuation of the la? bor adjustment agency of the Na? tional War Labor Board. Agreements have been effected between labor and , employers through this agency, the report says, by which certain prin? ciples have been placed above further dispute. Agricultural areas should be pur- j chased by the Federal government : and added to the public domain to provide land for the -carrying out of ; the proposed colonization programme for returned 'members of the military forces, the report asserts. It is pro? posed that the administration of the programme be directed by- a board consisting of the heads of the Agri? cultural, Interior and Labor depart? ments. Legislation needed to carry out the plan, Secretary Wilson believes, .should include these provisions: The possibility of commercialied speculation must be eliminated. Colonists must be given access, not only to land, but to farms; not to the bare soil, but to fully equipped agri? cultural plants ready to operate. The farms themselves must be weld ed together into genuine communities, by provision for roads, school* and markets, under the general supervision of the Federal government. Arrangements have been completed, says the report, to care for demobilzied men who do not care to take up farm work so far as possible through the United States employment service, a j branch of the department. On this i point the Secretary says: "In presenting these recommenda? tions at this time, I regard it unnec? essary to point out further possibili? ties. In setting forth the necessity for land settlement I am not unmindful of the vast numbers who must again lind their places in our complex in dustrial organization. It is too early at present to forecast accurately the industrial organization or needs of our ? nation after *.ho war. All the properly : adapted facilities of the Department \ of Labor are at present engaged in the study of those problems for recon- : stuction peculiar to manufacturing and secondary industry; and from time to , time I shall have; recommendations and conclusions to present based upon such studies."

More Light Is Advocated To Move Freight FasJer Better illumination of piers and ter? minals will make freight move faster, in the opinion of A, L. Powell, who spoke last night before the New York section of the Illuminating Engineering Society. Mr. Powell, who has investi? gated the subject in collaboration with ? R. E. Harrington, believes that at most freight handling stations the lighting is too poor for efficient operation. Because good lighting will facilitate transportation it should be an impor? tant factor in a programme of indus? trial reconstruction, Mr. Powell said. "It will increase the speed of ship? ment," he added, "because it will enable truckmen to move faster and with more l confidence', and because it will make it easier to read markings on packages. Moreover, it will reduce the number of missent shipments, cut down losses from spoilage and theft, and will make : it easier for freight handlers to please the public." -*-,?
