The Curiosities of Crime There was received on Friday at the Treasury department a ncte purporting to be a United States legal tender note of the denomination of five but: dred dollars. It is composed of parts ot differ ent genuine notes of various denomination*. The center is part ol a one hundred dollar note, with the "one" taken out of the center and upper border and a "ttve" neatly inserted. The left hand lower end contains a portrait of An dre* Jackson taken from a five-dollar note; the right hand lower end a vignette from a ten dollar note. The scroll work containing the figures Ave hundred has been taken tiom a na tional bank note. The back of the note is from a ten-dollar United States note, the "ten" hav ing been cutout and replaced by the ovals from the back of a "five." Although this note is not calculated to deceive bankers and brokers, it would readil) be taken by those not accustomed to handle miiali money, as the engraviog is ail genuine. ??

We bear that several other pieces ot sculpture bv-the same artist will shortly be placed on ex hibition in New York, where hi*? work is highly prired. Mr. Mozier's history very forcibly illus trates wlia' geniu* will occasionally do in ppitc of adverse circums; ances.
