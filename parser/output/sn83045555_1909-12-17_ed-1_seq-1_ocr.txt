Chief of Police Barlow from the outraged friends of poor old Ed Murtle whose skull he put up In his ofllco at the police station for a Joke The Tribune has turned turtle In a most amazing manner within the last three days Thursday morning The Tribune s ld The story Is not only unfounded but a most wilful and deliberate false hood This morning The Tribune modifies this and makes a long

pl clly In The News Thurs ay night thut Chief of Police Barlow had asked for Murtiea bones that Barlowa accom panied by Detective Cur n visited the labpratory that Dr Klrtley wa pres ent that Chief Barlow looked at a 1 corps on the dissecting table and recognized it as Hurtles body that dissection had Just been started but that tho features were easily recogniz able by any person who had known Murtle that a few days ago after Murtioa skull had been prepared It was taken to Chief Barlow and that the records showed that Murtles body had been received and pickled In a vat In the laboratory and then dis sected after it had been held for CO das In accordance with the statute In such cases made and provided The case Is only humorous because of Barlows predicament but the other side of the matter Is a grisly Joke A storm of indignation has greeted this latest outrage Before the incident is closed Murtios friends may demand that Justice of the Peace and Acting Coroner Stanley A Hanks Actng investigation Chief Barlow now claims that Murtles body was buried in the unimproved section of Calvary ceme tery The coroner can easily ascertain tho truth of tills claim by having the body exhumed from tho grave in which Murtie is claimed to have been burled IN KEEPING WITH POLICY Tho Tribune says In Its to headline this morning News comes forward with foolish story This Is In keeping with The Tribunes policy In defending Barlow and Sheets In the scandalous Whatcott diamond swindle But The TrIbune was quickly and effectively si cnccd then by sworn affidavits made jy the victims
