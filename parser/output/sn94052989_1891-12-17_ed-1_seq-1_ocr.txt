INDIAN LANDS OF WYOMING. An interview with J. 1). Wood of Lander, Wyo., Chairman of the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indian Commission, has been published, in which lie stated that he is on his way to Washington to oppose a ratifica tion ot the treaty negotiated by a majority of tnat commission, on the ground that the price paid was more the lands are worth. C. U. Merrill at, who was one of the majority of the commission, said, in an interview to day, that the commission had secured more than half of the reservation of these Indians iv Wyoming Tlio amount ceiled is esti mated at 1,100.000 acres, out of 11.00 ',000 be longing to the Indians, and the commission paid about 55 cents per acre. The lands are well watered by the Wind River aud ilia Big Horn, with their tributaries. Good timber is found in the northern and western portions, and there are indications of min erals. In Wyoming the Wind River country is regarded as one of the favored portions of the State. "Mr. Woodruff is disappoint ed," said Mernliat, "bee.use th« Indians absolutely refused to accept the offer he made of 8100,000 for only about 00,000 acres of land additional near the town of Lander. The majority of the com mission, in disregard of Woodruff's advice, not to make a treaty unless the Indians would sell this southern strip, made a treaty to buy the northern and eastern portions of the reservation and thereby secure all the lands the Indians will part with at the pres ent time. That Woodruff's opposition arises solely from his failure to get this southern tract, even for so much as SI 66 per acre, is evidenced by the. record of th« first council, when he himself made a proposition to pay the Indians thu same amount of money ths commission afterward agreed for the identi cal land secured." NOT AN INDIAN. Assistant Attorney-General Shields of the Interior Department has decided that Juno Waldron, who is a daughter of a white father and a half-blood Indian mother, was born a citizen of the United States, and that her claim that sho is an Indian by virtue of being born of an Indian mother caonot be allowed; neither can she longer be permit ted to draw rations and annuities, nor re ceive lands in severally. It is said at the Indian Bureau that this practically decides about 1000 similar cases in all parts of the West. THE I.ATI.V-AMERICAN .-REPUBLICS. President Harrisou to-day sent to the Senate a letter from the Secretary of State inclosing a copy of the first auuual report of Director Curtis of the Bureau of American Republic*. It says: "The immense number of applications received lor information about the North American countries give ample evidence of the awakened interest in commerce and the conditions of the neigh boring countries, that is encouraging to those endeavoring to promote social and commercial relations with the American re publics." The report refers to the rapidly increasing export trade to the Central and South American republics, and says: Many United States manufacturers, who never at tempted to sell merchandise in the southern continent, ore now sending agents into those markets to introduce their goods. The merchants of Mexico and Central and South America, who heretofore purchased In Europe exclusively, are now coining to tho United States, nnd invariably discover that they can find here nearly every article they need ( of a better quality and at no greater cost." ■ The recently negotiated reciprocity " arrangements, it is said, also afford them op portunities that are beginning tj be under stood aud appreciated. . ••

States have joined heartily in the enterprise aud have made generous concessions. ;.The bureau has been enabled to prepare fur exhibition at Chicago, a histoiical collection illustrating the dia- cnvery, conquest and settlement of Latiu- America and the subsequent periods. The report contains much information of interest. Among other things it is proposed to pre pare for the exposition a commercial exhibit illustrating the various classes of merchan dise best adapted to the wants and most ac ceptable to the tastes of consumers in Mex ico, Central and South America and the West Indies. This exhibit, it is proposed at the close of the exposition, will be perma nently established either in Washington or .New York. COMMITTEE ON RTTI.E9. • The appointment of the House Committee on Rules Is regarded by members of the House as a return to the former policy of appointing members of this committee with out reference to their other committee as-, signments. MeMillin, one of the new mem bers of the Kules Committee, is prominent as a tariff reformer, and whs one of the most active members of the Ways and Means Committee. He says, however, that he is in favor of the apoolutmont of Mills as Chairman of the lust-named committee. McMiilin's selection as a member of the Rules Committee Is ascribed to his parlia mentary ability, his effectiveness as a de bater, and the fact that he is personally very well liked by the members on the Democratic side, and will, therefore, be of great assist ance in securing a harmonious adjustment of any differences which may rise as to party policy. ditchings of Mississippi is a firm personal friend of the new Speaker, and our of the active men of his canvass.

Exports 10 British West Indies, 100,000; British Guiana, 82,100,000; total, $10,200,000. Fur the past three or four weeks negotia tions have been in progress which have re sulted in the agreement that, in return for the continued free entry of sugar and cof fee into the United States it has be -n agreed by the colonies not only to greatly enlarge the free list of their tariff but also to make a very considerable reduction in the duty on leading agricultural and other products of the United States. 

WEATHER BUREAU CHANGES. The Department of Agriculture proposes to adopt an improvement of thn Weather Bureau Service.

The public will be informed on the evening before of the expected weather and will be given the improved forecast the next morning, if an improvement is needed. By this plan the needs of,the public will be more fully met AMENDING THE TIMBER CULTURE ACT. Senator Yilas of Wisconsin introduced a bill amendatory to the act repealing the timber culture law?,'the first amendment striking out the requirement that a. person must be an actual resident to be allowed to make final proof, and the second striking out the provision that no person shall be entitled to make, an entry of desert land ex cept he be a resident of the State or Terri tory in which the land Is located. •

Senator Dolph is inclined to believe that total prohibition in the District of Alaska would be impracticable, but he introduced a bill in the Senate to-day providing fur a high license, and he thinks that it will! at least have the effect of diminishing the sale of liquors to the Indians. LAIIGE PURCHASES OF SILVER. Of 1,068,000 ounces of silver offered for sale to the Treasury Department to-day 708,000 ounces were purchased, as follows: 100,000 ounces at .9560. 50,000 ounces at .9628, 558,000 ounces at .9570.

Both Factions Organize and Appoint Con ference Committees—Failure of Efforts to Heal the Breach. t pedal to The Mokniko Cicr,.. Baton Rouge (La.), Dec 10.— The Demo cratic Convention was announced to meet here to-day, but when the time came two distinct bodies assembled, this being a fight over the lottery question. Last night the McEuery men held a caucus, as did also the Adams people, and appointed conference committees. ,"-",-: The Adams committee demanded that all frivolous contests be dismissed; that all dis cussions as to the submission of the lot tery amendment to white primaries be aban doned; that the convention place in the platform an anti-lottery plank, and that proper assurances be given fur the faithful carrying out of its provisions. The tox-Enery committee replied that its caucus was composed of both pro and anti lottery men, who had come alike instructed to submit the question to white primaries. They would not abandon their position; if they did, it would mean to the world that they were simply office-seekers. To-day, when the State Committee met, Chairman Lanier was not present, and the committee deposed him, electing Governor Wickcliffe Chairman. The committee then proceeded to perfect arrangements for the convention, and the anti-lottery men, with Lanier at their head, held a similar meeting. Efforts to heal the breach failed, and at noon the two conventions, each claiming to represent the Democracy of the State, as sembled. Nothing beyond routine organiz ation was accomplished by either body, ex cept the appointment of a committee by the McEnery people to confer with the opposi tion. The anti-McEner!es had internal trouble of theii own, a number of their mem bers desiring to abrogate the Lafayette agreement and bring about the nomination of a new ticket, in which the farmers were to have a part, but not the leadership. The farmers refused to budge an inch, insisting upon the terms of agreement, and T. S. Adams for Governor. It is thought the convention will carry out the agreement, as a refusal would result in another division, and a straight-out farm ers' ticket. FKEK COINAGE.

The dispatch also states that Spe.iker Crisp has fully decided to mitke Bland Chairman of the Committee on Coinage, Hnd th;it a uvij irity of tlia mem bers of ttie committee are to be advocates of tree silver. El Paso, Dec. 16.—The Southwest Silver Convention to-day elected W. T. Thornton of New Mexico, President and Mr. Shannon of Arizona, Secretary.

DISTRESS IN JAPAN. Tb.3 -Consul Makes an Appe ' to the American People. New York, Dee. 17.— suffering and want of thousands of people in Japan who were made homeless by the earthquake of October 2Sth have not lessened since that (rightful calamity. Vice-Consul of Japan Kito says that he desires to ask the Ameri can people and the Japanese residents of this country to assist in alleviating the woes of the unfortunate sufferers.

The money was forwarded by cable as it is ueeded at once, and although the. amount was comparatively tmall when th« number whs are in want is taken into con sideration, every little counts, and contri butions, no matter how small, will lie grate . fully received. I also intend to write Sir Edwin Arnold and request him to give a reading tor the benefit of some of the peo ple wh j live in the land he loves so well." -♦
