Yet man' ny a young woman whose affections are alrea say engaged, nest' tates to assume the obligations of wifehood and motherhood, because she feels unfitted for them by some physical weakness or disease. The special ailments to which the femi nine organism is liable, not only unfit a wo man for happy wifehood and motherhood, but incapacitate her for any sphere of action. No woman can discharge tne daily duties of any position with comfort or satisfaction who is constantly weighed down by head aches, backaches and dragging, weakening drains. Troubles of this nature are not by any means a necessity of womanhood. They are positively and completely cured by Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription.

Everybody is expected to bring their on dinner which can be spread on tbe table in the hall. Ih't coffe will be furnished by lbs Tangent Grange, also table furniture. It is essentially neces sary for the farmers to attend these as they are in need ot all tbe informa tion they can possibly obtain. Tbe Professors of tbe college kindly pre sent tbe different subjects, then it is expected those present will take np the work and enter into the discussion, fclnsic will be furnished by the Tangent Orchestra. I tbinc during ti.e winter when tbe farmers are not otherwise occupied, it is well for them to meet together and dis cuss the different methods of farming, and see if they cannot obtain some val uable information, by an interchange of ideas and experiences. 8ome would think the time spent in this manner entirely wasted, but let those who are skeptical attend a few of these meetings and tbey will change their mind.
