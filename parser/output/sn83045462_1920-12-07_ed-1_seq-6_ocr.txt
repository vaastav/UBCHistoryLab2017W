President Wilson's mesaasre to Congress. not delivered in person, but in the former style of presentation. Is One of the briefest of his addresses to that body. It is notable in that it makes no mention directly of the subject of paramount interest, that of peace-making; and league indorsement, though it may be read in interpretation with a bearing upon that theme. The President takes his text from the sentence of Abraham Lincoln: "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it." The faith, he says, was the force that prevailed over Germany, and was the spirit in which our men went into the fields and upon the sea to make sure of victory. In the keeping of that faith, says the President, it is the duty of the United States to insure that democracy will meet its final test. This country must offer within its own borders an example of "the will and power of democracy to make and enforce laws which are unquestionably just and which are equal in their administration." . In practical matters the President yoints to certain needs to aid in the restoration of the country from the disturbing and disastrous effects of the War. One of these is a budget system, which he hopes will be provided by legislation at this session in a form to meet the'objections on constitutional grounds raised against preceding legislation. In his report on the financial condition of the country the President Botes the fact that within the next two and a half years seven and a half billions of war indebtedness will mature. and the fiscal program of the government must be determined with reference to these maturities. There must be rigid economy, vigorous salvage operations and adequate revenues from taxation to realize a surplus of eurrent receipts over expenditures to be applied to the floating debt. Revision of the tax laws is an urgent necessity. Simplification is required to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense and to make his liability more certain ana aennue. A sympathetic note is struck in a paragraph dealing With the problem ef providing adequate facilities for the care and treatment of former members ?f the military and naval forces who are sick or disabled as a result of their participation in the war. The president indicates that these men. Who cannot be rewarded in money, must be given the most ample provision for their medical care as well as their vocational training and placement. Two specific recommendations take ttie message from the range of routine. One is that the United State make a lean to Armenia under the supervision ef a commission or a commissioner. The other is that the people of the Philippines, having fulfilled the conditions set by Congress, should now be granted their independenceThere is in the massage a note of Pat ent hopefulness and of faith. It v. :ds points of contention and lays p.: re Congress a statement of the Baaonal situation In terms that comleu.id attention. Kitchener had an aversion to newsps'-er writers.

Tie Careful Man. One ot the slogans on the front of Hit street cars in this city as a feature Cf ".Mo Accident week" is particularly Worthy of stress and attention: "The best safety device is a careful man." JThis means a careful man?or woman ?driving a vehicle or walking. It feaeari* care in straightaway running kit turning corners, cars, to observe the rules which have been devised for iphe protection of everybody, care to H>(iv consideration for others. A careful man will not go to the Jimit of what the rules permit, but fslll always have a margin of safety, jle will recognise the fact that the Streets are congested and always pe uruwi/ ofltngwDUB. 1 no careiui frrls ?r will know thai there are people frbrnad who deserve the name of jay praliters, and govern himself to refrut-e to a minimum the risk of hitting : fhem. The careful walker, will reelj free that he can stop or start In the frtreet quicker than an automobile, and fro regulate his movements that he frrill not assume too great a risk on *he pr eeumption of guaranteed right pt way at crossings. A careful man will not walk across the street without knowing what Is coming. He will never walk c rookedJy without assuming a full responsibility for his course. He will reeogjilse that a street ear cannot turn fr frfr Its tracks and that an antomobU* fras In the crowded part of town a very | ? narrow roadway with many obstructions alongside.

If he walks he will realise that those awheel have many things to watch while they drive, and that he it only one item in the multitude. In short, the careful man will ward himself and others from danger, even tknn*K it mav mat Viim a littles Inftfl Hwupaa ? iiiuj vwwh 

UIIII ? ' ??? of time. He will adopt aa hit motto, "It ia better to be safe than sorry." The Hew Order and the Country. Two things, developed yesterday, should give heart and hope to the country. (1) The new order will establish, and endeavor to maintain, good working relations between the President and the Congress. Mr. Harding's address in the Senate chamber?intended for the whole American people?la whole' some in tone and purpose, and certain to bear fruit. It was well received by those who heard it. It will be responded to favorably by those whose legislative commissions begin to run March 4. (2) The new order will function as soon as possible?within a fortnightafter coming into being. The Sixtyseventh Congress is to meet in special session and at once tackle the mandate of last mdnth. It will be led In both branches by men of large and long legislative experience, wno win xaae up their work with thorough knowledge of the details. They enjoy public confidence. They deserve the confidence they enjoy. They are conscious of the magnitude of their task, and of what is expected of them. Men of their class and capacity have never been inspired more than these men should, and probably will. be. Now what greater assurance need? could?the people receive as to benefits derivable from our institutions than this? The President, after full consultations with representative men of all parties, will make his recommendations, and a competent and sympathetic Congress will consider and pass upon them. There will be no delay except that imposed by the Constitution. An earlier start would if it could be made. But the wheels cannot be set to turning sooner than March. After that we shall get results, and such as our conditions demand. i The Session and the Work. As sentiment in both parties on Capitol Hill is in favor of the routine and as little else as possible this winter, and as the routine is unusually Important and difficult, the sooner Congress buckles to the w.ork and the more steadily and industriously sticks to It the better. Supply bills are sometimes maneuvered for trading purposes. Some are held back in the stages of preparation. Others when taken up in the open chambers are debated with studied leisurellness. Still others are delayed in conference. Then comes a rush as the session draws to the close, and differences in the givewnd-take fashion are hurriedly adjusted, or a Jam results and some of the bills fall of passage. There ought to be no Jam next March. Every Item in every bill should be examined on its merits, and every bill passed before the clock points to noon on adjournment day. The Sixty-seventh Congress will tackle the mandate issued at the polls last month. The republicans will take complete control. Mr. Harding will be in the White House with the biggest plurality behind him ever cast jfor a presidential candidate, while the I Senate will show a substantial republican majority and the Hou?e a record majority of republican votes. Together, the executive and the legislators, will have their hands full, and should not be forced to clean up after the Congress now sitting. There is time enough, though none to spare, for the work. No doubt President-elect Harding's willingness to accept advice has L_ _?_a t_ i i_ S-ii gittuini Ituit enougn uuuy mill 10 consume aeveral hours in the reading. A Chicago man made his will on a phonograph record. A jazz funeral march should appear on the other side of the disc.

It begins Jo look as though D'An nunzlo. after thundering defiance tc the government at Rome, had concluded that discretion Is the better part of valor after all and that It li prefc. -ble to compromise on some thing less than to seek an and lose | an. The situation at Flume has eased somewhat as negotiations have progreased for an adjustment by which D'Annunzio, it la reported, will yield certain of the islands In accordance with the terms of the treaty of Kapallo, whUe Italy will recognize the regency of Quarnero. It Is of little moment whether the Italian government or D'Annunzio'i Independent organization controls In the area denied Jugoslavia In the Adrl a tic zone. That is a matter between Italy and D'Anaunzio, .and the only point of issue between them relates to the matter of "self-determination* for the people of the Dalmatian coast, whom D'Annunzio claims as dominant ly Italians while the Jugoslavs claim them as dominantly of their national itv. A war between Italy and D'Aaaun sio woald be in the last degree fooltst and wasteful of energies that Itafs can ill afford to risk. It could, ol course, only result in one way. in th< subjection of D'Annunsio and the ee tablishment of Italian autharit) throughout the area given to thai country under the terms of the treat) of Rapallo. If a compromise is ef fee ted D'Annunsio will remain estab lished at Flume, but with a definite responsibility to the government at Rome, and it Is to be believed that is 0 the course of a short time there will be no practical difference between i Home and the Adriatic city in the mati ter of administration. This is an out: come devoutly to be wished by all l friends of Italy. The Virginia Sena tort hip. A rousing senatorial campaign in [ Virginia is assured. Mr. Swan son asi pires to succeed himself. Qov. Davis i has announced, and former Gov. Mon, tague is turning the matter over in his mind. All are strong men. Mr. Swanson and Mr. Montague are orators of power. Gov. Da "is has made reputation in office, and came to the r,laoA Vie* n ^Amnnstrellnn u? ? iliai ncu uvuiuuai'iauvii v? popular favor. Virginia has been fortunate in her senators for years. John 8. Barbour | was a very competent man. with a business equipment. He rendered the | state notable service. John W. Daniel was a lawyer and an orator of a high class, and died in harness. Thomas J 8. Martin served for a quarter century, led his party in the Senate, and exercised great influence in the cham1 ber. His successor. Carter Glass, has in the briefest period taken good rank, and promises to become one of the Senate's most useful members. Mr. Swanson went from the House t to the governorship of Virginia, and then came from the governorship to 1 the Senate. He was a trained man, r therefore, when elected to his present office, and has shown his training ! there. His committee assignments are good, and in the debates of the chamber he has taken a prominent part. While his health of late has not been_ robust, he announces a purpose to make a thorough campaign; and that | la notice to his competitors that they must do their utmost. The situation throughout the country is such that all the states should be represented in both houses of Congress by the best men available. - A Beggar by Day. Score another for the old dictum that truth is stranger than fiction! This time the demonstration comes from San Francesco, where a woman has sued for annulment of marriage on the ground that her husband, who had pretended to her to be the son of a wealthy New Yorker, was in reality a beggar who sought alms during the day as a deaf mute and at night played the part of a rich man. In the annals of beggary there are maBy I cases of dual roles and real wealth. ' This chap, it would seem, was not particularly prosperous, at least not enough so to put him beyond the \ range of temptation of stealing from j his wife. He "lifted" from her room at a hotel, after she had begun pro-; ceedings against him. a camera and other pawnable articles. It seems t iat Van d'1-.oye was not very clever at his work. He was careless about his appurtenances of trade. His wife, exercising the age-long privilege of woman kind, in going through his pockets on one occasion found some cards reading, "I am deaf and dumb. Alms, fur pity's sake, alms!" One thinks of HaJJ, the beggar, with his "Alms, for the love of Allah!" and his comfortable home in which be was rearing a flower-like daughter, so fair that she [ was sought in single wifehood by the sultan in disguise. Van d'Loye? , if that is his real name, which is doubtful?should have had a clearing bouse between fiis "pitch" and his i home. After having elevated some eminent and worthy brewers to the peerage, Britain finds it difficult to turn her back with abrupt discourtesy on their products. A patriot must make sacrifices. Paderewsld must be terribly out of practice by this time. President-elect Harding is busy while in Washington, but not so busy as he will be. tHOOTDre 8TA18. BY
