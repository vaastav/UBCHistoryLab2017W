THE ST. JOHNStfUKY CALEDONIAN, DECEMBER 6, 1905. 3 THE MESSAGE president's Recommendations to Congress AS TO RAILROAD RATES Favors Creation of Administra tive Body to Handle tbe Mat terDiscusses Trusts, Insur ance, Revenue Revision, Army and Navy, Panama Canal and Many Other Subjects President Roosevelt's annual mes sage to congress opens with a plea for the co-operation of all classes in con tinuing the country's prosperity and in correcting existing evils, for a "square deal" for everybody, and first takes up the question of corporations and rail road rate legislation. The president says: I am in no sense hostile to corpora tions. The corporation has come to stay, just as the trades union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as It does good. But each should be sharply checked where It acts against law and Justice. I believe that regulation and supervision of great corporations, etc., can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. The Immediate and most pressing need so far as legislation is concerned Is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision and regu lation of the rates charged by the rail roads of the country engaged In Inter state traffic as shall summarily and ef fectively prevent the Imposition of un just or unreasonable rates. It must Include putting a complete stop to re bates in every shape and form. In my judgment, the most Important provision which such law should con tain Is that conferring upon some com petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought before It, this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review, by the courts. All private car lines, Industrial roads, refrigerator charges and the like should be expressly put under the su pervision of the interstate commerce commission or some similar body so far as rates and agreements practical ly affecting rates are concerned. A re bate In icing charges or in mileage or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a re bate in any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers. Only in this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. I hope that an employers' liability law will be prepared and enacted as speedily as possible. The remedy Is to regulate the pro cedure In issuing Injunctions in labor disputes is by requiring the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to be ex parte If the adverse party does not appear at the time and place or dered. What is due notice must depend upon the facts of the case. I recommend an Investigation by the department of commerce and labor of general labor conditions, especial at tention to be paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation In the several states. The department of commerce and la bor should also make a thorough Inves tigation of the conditions of women in Industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo men are now engaged in gainful occu pations, yet there is an almost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthy conclusions as regards a subject as important as It Is vast and complicated. The introduction of wo men In industry Is working change and disturbance In the domestic and social life of the nation. The decrease In marriage, and especially In the birth rate, has been coincident with It. Recent events have emphasized the Importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of the Insurance question, to see whether It is not possible to fur nish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It Is Impossible to outline what shape a readjustment of the revenues should take, for it is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for It. It Should be considered whether It is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or In favor of any other nation's maximum and minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure a cer tain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy and, to this end, of rigid scrutiny of appropriations. Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system. In flation must be avoided, but some pro vision should be made that will insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than In the less active seasons of the year, so that the currency will contract against specula tion and will expand for the needs of legitimate business. The president repeats bis recom mendation In his last annual message regarding federal elections. This government will do everything in its pow r to secure the success of The Ilagus conference to the end that substantial progress may be made In the cause of international peace, justice and good will. We must as a nation make Jt evi dent that we do not Intend to treat the Monroe doctrine in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the expense of the republics to the south. But we must make It evi dent that we do not Intend to permit It to be used by any nation on this conti nent as a shield to protect it from the 1 .uuoc4uuui;es ui us own misueeus against foreign nations. Santo Domingo has now made an ap peal to us, and not only every principle of wisdom, but every generous Instinct within us, bids us respond to the ap peal. The conditions in Santo Do mingo have for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society was on the verge of dis solution. Under the course taken by us stability and order and all the benefits of peace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, danger of foreign interven tion has been suspended, and there Is at last a prospect that all creditors will get justice, no more and no less. I do not believe that any army In the world has a better average of enlisted man or a better type of junior officer, but the army should be trained to act effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient appropria tions for maneuvers of a practical kind, for the promotion of exceptional ly meritorious men over the heads of their comrades and for the retirement of all men who have reached a given age without getting beyond a given rank. Our navy must, relatively to the na ivles of other nations, always be of greater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy, and It has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard must not only be maintained, but increased. In my last message I asked the at tention of .the congress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective, and I most ear nestly request that you pay heed to the report of the attorney general on this subject. To the 6pread of our trade In peace and the defense of our flag In war a great and prosperous merchant marine is Indispensable. We should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets and in case of need to re-enforce our battle line. It Is a matter of unmixed satisfac tion to call attention to the excellent work of the pension bureau, for the vet erans of the Civil war have a greater claim upon us than any other class of citizens. To them first of all among our people honor is due. We cannot have too much Immigra tion of the right sort, and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort. The questions arising In connection with Chinese immigration stand by themselves. As a people we have talked much of the open door In China, and we expect and quite rightly intend to Insist npon Justice being shown us by the Chinese. But we cannot expect to re ceive equity unless we do equity. The civil service rule has been amend ed by providing that where the inef ficiency or Incapacity comes within the personal knowledge of the head of a department the removal may be made without notice, the reasons therefor be ing filed and made a record of the de partment. Our copyright laws need revision. The agricultural conditions of the Isl ands enforce more strongly than ever the argument In favor of reducing the tariff on products of the Philippine Isl ands entering the United States. Immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of DTawall. This is the most important point in the Pacific to fortify in order to conserve the Inter ests of this country. It would be hard to overstate the importance of this need. I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Rico. I earnestly ask that Alaska be given nn elective delegate. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. Active work In canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been In prog ress for less than a year and a half. During that period two points about the canal have ceased to be open to debate. First, the question of route; second, the question of feasibility. The point which remains unsettled Is wheth er the canal shall be one of several locks above sea level or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the congress at an early day. the findings of the advisory board of American and European en gineers. In addition to sanitating the Isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provid ed for employes and an adequate sys tem of supplying them with wholesome food at reasonable prices has been created. Hospitals have been estab lished and equipped that are without su periors of their kind anywhere. During the past year a large portion of the plant with which the work Is to be done has been ordered. What Is needed now and without de lay Is an appropriation by the congress to meet the current and accruing ex penses of the commission. The first appropriation of $10,000,000 out of the $135,000,000 authorized by the Spooner act was made three years ago. It Is nearly exhausted. Unless the congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. In conclusion the president recom mends an Increase In the diplomatic and consular service and more ade quate compensation of Its members.
