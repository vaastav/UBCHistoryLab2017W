During the :;o years of his greatest business activity, it is estimated that Gould accumulated 10 cts per second, 96 per minute, over 9800 per day and over 93,000.000 per year. President Harrison in his message to congress attributes the defeat ot the tariff policy in the recent election to the passions engendered between workmen and their employers. Bradstreet's reports show the great est increase in trade last week to be at St. Joseph, Mo. 56.7 per cent; at Du luth Minnesota 66.5 per cent, and Wichita, Kans., 60.1 per cent. Beacon: The republican papers of Kansas are telling their readers that Leweiling is better than his party. This is an assurance that the state will not collapse when Humphrey goes out and Leweiling trfkes his place. No one can forget the lamentable cry before election that a populist victory would drive capital out of the country so that farmers could not borrow a cent. We think of it when we see money advertised in the Salina Regis ter at 74 per cent, without commission. Lawreucu Record. Jerry Simpson made a fair point when he declared on Friday night at Topeka, that the state capital would be moved from the brick building on the corner, (the Santa Fe general office) where it had been for many years to the stone building on the square. Haskell co'nnty is to be congratulated upon the departure of one of her citi zens: Hussey, the county clerk who certified up the election of Rosenthal's opponent, noticing that the atmosphere of that county began to look sulphur ous, concluded the climate there was unhealthful and betook himself to parts unknown. Gould has passed away; but the world still revolves, Wall Street still speculates, railroads still pool, and business circles scarce miss his pres ence. He was a superior man in his way, but though superior, the financial and railroad systems be championed grew too strong to need him, or seri ously feel his loss. President's message: "The wealth Of the country in 1860 was 916,199,616, 063; in 1800 it amounts to 962,110,000, 000, an increase of 288 per cent. The to tal mileage of railways in the United States in 18(50 was 30,728; in 1890 it was 167,741, an increase of 448 per cent; and it is estimated there will be about 4,000 miles of track added by the close of the year of 1S02.M The Leavenworth Times takes the ground that the state board of canvass ers erred in deciding the Coffey county tie bv secret ballot in a manner unsat isfactory to all parties.

The Rothchild on the international conference seems to have readdy secured the co-operaiion of the American members in a proposi tion to change the ratio between silver and gold, to fix the coinage value at twentv-fonr of silver to one of gold by weight. That if what the proposal to fix the value of silver at 43 pence per ounce means. Under the proposed ar rangement an ounce of silver would coin 87 cents, against 91 under the present American ratio of sixteen to one. The compromise of Prof. Soet beer would fix the whole ratio ot twenty to one. The whole thing is a surrender to the BothCbJlds, aud will, if succssfu' make perpetual the reduced prices of products that have impoverished labor since silver lias been reduced In price by demonetization. The loss on si2ver bullion as a commodity is a bagatelle compared with the effect on all other values bv thus raising money denomi nations. The participation by agents of this government is most glaring treachery. Latest U. S. Gov't Report Baking Powder The President's Message, No president of the United States ev er had such an opportunity to dilate honestly upon the greatness and pros perity of the United States as was af forded president Harrison, and it can confidently be asserted that no neglect of the privilige referred to is apparent in the annual message which be has sent to both houses of congress. It is reasonable to con clude that that much of the argu ment which be produces in his message would never have been written had the democratic party failed November 8, for In that case the republican cause would not need a champion, but things politically as they are, it was certainly notjimproper for the president todeliver himself of a closing official argument in behalf of the principles through which he was once elevated to the chief magistracy and once defeated. If any one expected that President Harrison would be less enthusiastic in his advo cacy of a protective tariff because of his defeat in the recent election that expec tation must be effectually removed by his message to congress. The Market Wrecker! What is the difference between the man who buys a farm because be is get ting it at a good bargain, and a market wrecker? The difference is this. The man who buys the farm is investing in a manner that identifies his interests with those of his fellow-man, his neigh bors and the community. So with the man who makes purchases of products to supply the demands of bis customers, the legitamate merchant. But the mar ket wrecker is a man whose interests are subserved by a periodical destruc tion of prices with a corresponding de pression of industry. His interests are opposed and destructive of the welfare of traders, and producers. He is an en emy of the best interests of humanity his neighbors, and society, seeking like a true iconoclast to destroy the values of what they produce and possess, and to take to himself the fragments of oth er men's fortunes without adding a par ticle to the world's wealth, prosperity, and happiness. These market wreck ers are not couffned to produce gam blers. They are found in real estate and mercantile circles, and behind the counters of money changers. But ev ert where their ghoulish work is the same. Facts For Farmers From the Secretary of Agriculture's Report. The report of the secretary of agri culture contains not only a most inter esting statement of the progressive and valuable work done under the adminis tration of Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions for the enlarged usefulness of this important department. in the successt ul ellort to break down the restrictions to the free intro duction of our meat products in the countries ot Europe, the secretary has been untiring from the first, stimu lating and aiding all other government officers, at home and abroad, whose official dnties enabled them to partici pate in the work. The total trade in hog products with Europe in May, 1892, amounted to 82,000,000 pounds against 46,900,000 in the same month of 1891; in June, 1892, the exports aggregated 85,000.000 pounds against 46,000,000 pounds in the same month of the orevious year; in July there was an increase of 41 percent and in August of 55 per cent over the corresponding months of 1891. Over 40,000,000 pounds of inspected pork have been exported since the law was put into operation, and a comparison of the four months of May, June, July and August, 1892 with the same months of 1891 shows an increase in the number of pounds of our export of pork products of 62 per cent and an increase in value of 66 oer cent. The exports of dressed beef increased from 137,900;000 pounds in 1889 to 220 500.000 pounds in 1892, or about 60 pei cent. During the past year there have beeu exported 364,607 head of cattle against 205,786 exported in 1889. This increased exportation has been largely promoted by the inspection authorized by law and the faithful efforts of the secretary and his efficient subordinates to make the inspection thorough and to carefully exclude from all cargoes diseased or suspected cattle. The requirement of the English reg illations that live cattle arriving from the United States must be slaughtered at the docks had its origin in the claim that pluro-pneumonia existed among American cattle and the existence of the disease could only certainly be de termined by post mortem inspection The department of agriculture has labored with great energy and faithful ness to extirpate this disease, and on the 26th day of September last a public announcement was made by the sec retary that the disease no longer existed within the United States. He is en tirely satisfied, after the most searching inquiry, that this statement was just ified aud that by a continuance of the inspection and quarantine now required of cattle brought into this country the disease can be prevented from ajjain g'etting any foothold. The value to the cattle industry of the United States of this achievement can hardly be cs riinated. We cannot, perhaps, at once insist that the evidence shall be accepted as satisfactory by other countries, but if the present exemption from the disease is mantatned and the inspection of our cattle arriving at foreign ports in which our own veterinarians par ticipate, confirms it, we may justly expect that the requirement that our cattle shall be slaughtered at the docks will be revoked, as the sanitary re strictions on our pork products have been. If our cattle can be taken alive to the interior the trade will be enor mously increased.

Switzer con cerning the eclipse. In response to a question proposed J. L. Switzer concern ing the present eclipse, he sends us an other article which we will insert next week. Below, we produce his article of '88 A 

FARMER TO A FAR3IEK. Mixoona, Kas., Nov. 16, 1SS8. Friend Switzer: Did you see the account of the late eclipse? For fear you did not, X will give you a short ac count of it: Ou the morning of Nov. 6. 1888, the bandana rose in ail its glorj and a little after eight o'clock a cloud began to gather over it; at noon it was half covered, and at 6 p. m., the eclipse was total and visible throughout the United States and England, and the darkness was so dense that the demo crats and union labor people have not recovered their spirits vet. The fusion of democrats and union laborites did not avail, as the entire republican county ticket was elected with majori ties ranging from 75 to 250. There was a grand ratification in Med icine Lodge last Saturday, and it was better than any 4th of July, and bet paying was in order. Sanderson is wear ing a $10 00 pair of hoots; hope they will last him well. Jerry Simpson is nix. Did you see the sun shine on the 7th inst.? Well, it rose and the man of destiny got left "Hurrah for Harri son and Morton.' Harrison got 12 ma joritv in Mingona township. Kansas spoke right out in meeting; also West Virginia; and Harrison gets 239 votes Some of the"Demos." say it was pretty close. The union laborers polled be tween 200 and 800 in Barber county. Not much news since election news cooled down. Are having fine weaMier and are all welb.hope. von will not eat so much in that bountiful country that vou will get sick. Well, be good to yourself and let me hear from you. Yours Respectfully, Peter Martin'. Monmouth., Kas., Nov. 25, 18S8. My Dear Friend Peter Martin: Your letter was received only yesterday your very kind letter, I will say, al though I recognize a taunting mood was over you when you wrote it. I take pleasure in replying. With sore and chapped hands and weary back, fresh from the corn-field, I am putting in a midnight hour in recognition of yonr friendly taunt, and now if I should speak plain, "right out in meetin' " I hope you will receive it as well as I do yours. "Did Isee the account of the eclipse ?" Yes; with shame 1 saw it. Not that I feared, or cringed from jeers of taunts. but on account of the political eclipse of manly integrity and principles which took place on November 6th. my very cheeks tingle with shame. The eclipse is not over yet, but is doubtless just coming on, and if a deepening shadow does not continue to rest upon the land I shall be most agreeably undeceived. Fhe result of the election, as far as Kansas is concerned, was indeed a sur prise. It adds strong argument to the calvinistic dogma of total depravity. It tells the same old oft-repeated story. of gullibility and humbug, and is a re newed, fresh and discouraging repeti tion of the want of integrity and princi ples among the agricultural people of the country. Never was there a politi cal campaign with so little on one side and so much on the other as this one. Never was there a grosser illustration of choosing the evil and refusing the good, We had trusted confidently to our own good state of Kansas as the star of promise. She was first in the war on "lavery, first in the grand charge on the liquor traffic, and we had hoped that she was now ready to put on her beautiful garb and lead the van in plac ing the great agricultural and laboring masses in equal representation before the tribunals of this broad land. Not 30 this time. But we will watch and wait and hope. The defeat this time cannot be attributed to ignorance. You were enlightened as to the entire emp tiness of the so-called great issue that was before the people. Tariff! tariff! tariff! tariff! was the watchword. Tariff was the battle cry. What on earth has the tariff to do with you or I or the agricultural inter est of this country. If the republicans and democrats had hollered booh! booh! booh! booh! it would have been just as significant. You were plainly told before the election that republican tariff meant 47 per cent and democratic tariff meant nearly 43 per cent. Great, grand gigantic issue of 4 6-10 per cent between them. I asked a republican in the corn-field the other day his reason for voting the republican ticket. He just had one answer; tariff. "What hae you got now that you did not have before," I asked. "Do you buy salt for your stock?" "Yes." Will the tariff reduce the price?" "Hurrah for Harrison!" Do you buy sugar for yoni family?" "Yes." "Isn't the sugar trust sufficiency trustworthy without bolstering it up with a high tariff?" "Oh," he says, "we want protection.' Yes, verily tee do. "Why are you pre paring to move to Illinois?" "Becaust I have bean trying to farm here four years and 1 can't make a living.' "Then, I think somebody does need protection, but' who needs it?" Doe; the McCormick Manufacturing Co.. ueed it? Does the Bell Telephone Co., need it? The Armour packing house: the Studebaker Wagon Co.? do they need ptotection? Can you think of am leading manufacturers in any line whatever that have not become million aiies? Do they need protection? Are they not already organized into trusts and monopolies and abundantly able to protect themselves? Then tcho needs protection? Is it reasonable that the strong need protection against the weak? Would not a sensible man think the reverse would be true? I'll tell you my deqr friend Peter, my heart is pouriug out at my pencil point I write. Twice I have been exiled from beautiful homes and 50 years of my life has been spent in trying to stem the unequal current, and with me, at least, the needs and necessities of legis lation favoring the agricultural and laboring classes of this country has be come a settled principle. It is too deep and sacred to be affected by jeers. It seems to me that nothing but the want of brains and the disposition to follow a chimera and love to be gulled and humbugged can cause a farmer: nc' otherwise. Labor and agriculture is the foundation upon which every nat ional, political and social structure must rest1 it is the necessary basis of all prosperity. WhaUa spectacle that the foundation stone of our national grandeur should be unrepresented al most unheard in our national legisla ture. Apiculture ana labor are the frame work of our nationality. How pitiable when the frame -work has be come so affegted with dry rot that the breath of a few demagogues brawling tariff can blow it over. It is the bone and sinew and muscle of the land. What a miserable spectacle when the children are all born so rickety that they havnt back-bone to stand erect before men and demand their rights. It certainly does seem hard that the parent of all prosperity should be en tirely ignored and turned out by hi3 children; but how much more pitiable the case is when the parent himself be comes demented and no loDger recogni zes that he is poor aud miserable and blind and naked. Talking with Capt. Greer a short time ago, he said: "Yes, the farming interest of the country dops need some attention, but the Republican partv will give it to them." Must the parent then stand without aud beg? O shame! You, Peter, viewed the eclipse, 1 think, through a smoked glass; hence it seemed to you like the bandana was in eclipse. To mo the phenomena bears the more serious aspect of eclipsed man ly integrity and sound judgement. I have a good ohance here to see some of the workings of our past legislation. Here more than in Barber county the land is owned by landlords and occu pied by tenants. Here the exiled from tne West are flocking in, pushing each other around and over-bidding each other for land to rent. We are only one family among many others that are here partially dependent on charity for subsistance, and at the mercy of land lords for terms of occupancy. Yet men who own land say that farming does not pay. Can you account for this, Peter? Is it over-production or under-production? Is it because of the last 4 years of Democratic rule or is it because of the previovs 26 years of Republican rule? Is it because the tariff has been too low? What is the matter. Corn 20 cents a bnshel; corn starch 10 cents a pound; beef cattle one cent a pound beef I2i to 15 cents; beef hides 2 to 3 cents a pound; leather 40 cents; hogs, $4:85; breakfast bacon 121 to 15 cents; pig iron 1 to 2 cents a pound; stoves $30; harvesters $200. Tax 4 per cent to 6 per cent on the valuation of property. Money, made by the government, at a fjnere nominal cost is 24 per cent a year to the farmer, but to the banker it is nix; and to the congressman it is nix and to the brokers on Wall street it is snipnety-snase and soft snap. Seventy-five bushels of corn will buy a stirring plow that costs less than So to make it; 125 bushels will buy a corn plow that taxes the manufacturer less than $10; 375 bushels will buy a mowing machine that represents about $20; 150 hushels will buy you a cooking stove. Fat cows are being sold in Kansas City for less than the freight charges and ex penses of getting them there. Sheep iikewise. The board ot trade sets the price on your produce! Bankers set the price on the money we use; Armour sets the price ou meat; the milling com pany sets their price on flour; Arhuckle gives us coffee at his own rate, the su gar trust refines our sugar at their own sweet will. For leather, iron, cotton, wool or other manufactured product, we pay the price that is set for the farmer and congress meekly "sets'" and looks on. All other classes recognize the pru dence of co-operation and organization for their mutual benefit; but the farm ers are every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost. Out at the knees, vet brawling tariff: barefooted, yet intensly anxious about protecting the manufacturing interests of this country; off celebrating a glorious re publican victory while the better-half sits at home pitching the breeches and the larder is without tea, flour or salt yelling "hurrah for Harrison!" while the banker is laughing in his sleeve and planning to foreclose the mortgage in the most bland and gentlemanly man ner. Wearing a Harrison badge with all the ostentation of a turkev gobbler, while the children are wearing patched shirts made of discarded flour sacks and stamped "Roller Process." Now, is this sense? Is it prudence? The Farmers' Congress has just had a meeting in Topeka aud passed some huge "resolutions." How many of them, before passing the resolutions, had spent a whole year on Harrison and the republican party and thus practically thrown away every bit of available influence for good as far as the amelioration of the farming interest is concerned. The grange has given another kick or two. They kick like a mule and then go and vote for the party that frustrate every movement they make. Penny wise and pound foolish. Saving at the spile and los ng at the bung-hole. Is this sense? No, my brethren; "These things ought not to be." God has given you this govern ment, so why tamper with it in this senseless manner? Who has control in this land? The majority. Who are the majority? The agricultural and laboring classes no, the agricultural and laboring asses long eared chaps that raise the corn to feed the geese to feather their nests and set on the golden egg. What have we gained by the election of Harrison? Four years of delay; four years more for the wealthy to pile up more wealth; four more years of oppression for the very ones that, most of iu this government, need protection; Would it have been better if Streeter had been elected? Yes, eminently. It would have filled the whole house of :he great big agricultural fatherhood of this land with music and rejoicing. The plow would have sped blithely along the furrow. The steps of the weary laborer would have otice more been springy and hopeful. Peter, don't think we are defeated We are not. We are beginning our next campaign right now and we will keep it up till in the halls of cong's aud in the legislatures of the various states the laboring classes of this country have au adequate representation. In conclusion, while I live and have a vote, that vote shall be on the sir?e of sense and just'ee and mercy. I Know not what others may choose, but for my part, give me. liberty from the thraldom of unequal legislation or give me death. Hoping that hereafter you and others of my Mingona friends may be wise enough to be always good to yourselves, I aui as ever J0"r sincere friead. James L. ftWITZER.

They are to be submitted to the pupils and the written work prepared under the teacher's direction and in accordance with the rules of the state board. The work shou'd be done be fore Christmas and returned to this office soon after, as it trust be sent to Topeka before Jan uary 1st.

An interesting program hts been prepared for each department of school work, viz: The primary and kindergar ten, the common and graded school, the col lege and high school, and. the department of county superintendents.

Among other things their announcement circular says: Teachers who attend the meeting of the association are the better for the acquaintance rhey make with other teachers of the state. A great meeting at the capital increases the influence of teachers througbont the state. Teachers are urged to consider the benefits of attendance, and to try to be present at the next meeting of the association.

One day last week two men drove to town-in a wagon. One of thernen is a church member and a goodish sort of a man. Coming to a place where the snow was drifted along the highway rather deeper than in the fields the church member proposed to unstaple the wire fence and drive through the field, but his companion who is a fair minded man said, no, 1 will not trespass against the owner of the premises here. If we should let the fence down and drive through his field others will fol low and make a road through this man's field and cause him trouble. I own a farm and I would not wish my fence torn down and a thoroughfare made through my field. At this the churchmember acquiesced, and as the team wended their way through the snow, the church member consoled himself by singing, " Winterstorms w 1 soon be over. We will anchor in the harbor, We are out on the ocean sailing To a home beyond the tide." I not ice that Sincerity in writing to the Cresset last week makes some vei y pertinent remarks with regard to tress passing hunters. This quail shooting nuisance should be stopped at any cost. The law makes it a criminal offence to bunt game in any persons enclosure or in the highway adjoining such enclosure without first obtaining the owner's consent. The smallest fine is five dollars. The law is sufficient and just, and all persons should have enough self respect to not criminally disobey the laws of the state.
