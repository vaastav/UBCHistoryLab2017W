2 PORTO RICO MESSAGE. ( ITIZEXSHIP IS VItGED. President Tells of Trip to Island and Its Needs. Washington. Dec 11.— The President's me.-i sage to Congress, giving the result of his recent observations in Porto Rico and making recom j mendations concerning the government of that island, was delivered to the Senate and House to-day. It was read at length and received careful attention. The rnvsage was as follows: To the Senate and House of Representatives: On November '21 I visited the island of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, crossing by the old Spanish road by Cayey to Fan Juan, and re turning next morning over the new American road from Arecibo to Ponce. The scenery was wonderfully beautiful, especially among the mountains of the interior, which constitute a veritable tropic Switzerland. I could not em bark at San Juan because the harbor has not been dredged out and cannot receive an Ameri can battleship. 1 do not think this fact cred itable to us as a nation, and I earnestly hope that immediate provision will be made for dredging Han Juan Harbor. I doubt whether our people as a whole real ize the beauty and fertility of Porto Rico, ana the progress that has keen made under its ad mirable government. We have Just cause, for pride In the character of our representatives "who have administered the tropic islands which came under our flag as a result of the war with *?pain. and Of no one of them is this more true than of Porto Rico. Jt would bo impossible to «-lsh a snoro faithful, a more efficient and a more disinterested public service than that now being rendered in the Island of Porte Rico by those in control of the Insular government. I stopped at a dossil towns all told, and one of the notable features In every town was th« gathering of the school children. The work that has been done in Porto Rico for educa tion has been noteworthy. The main emphasis, as is eminently wise and proper, has be+-n put upon primary education; but in addition to this there Is a normal loot an agricultural school, th:.-.- industrial and three high schools. Every effort Is being made to secure not only the benefits of elementary education to all the Porto JUcans of the next generation, but also as far as means will permit to train tliem so that the in dustrial, agricultural and commercial oppor tunities of the island can !>e utilized to the best ftossible advantage. It was evident at a glance that the teachers, both Americans and native Porto »■:'■•■.:.-. were devoted to their work, took the greatest prido in ■'-■ '"'•'■ were endeavoring to train their pupils, not only In mind, but In what counts for far more than mind In citizenship, that Is. la character. AN 

EXCELLENT ADMINISTRATION. I as very much struck by tha excellent char acter both at the Insular police and of the Porto Rloan regiment. They tire, both of them bodies that reflt-ct credit upon the American admin istration of the island. The insular police are under the local Porto Tilcan government. The Porto Ttiran regiment of troops must be appro priated for by Congress. I earnestly hope that this body -will \ •■ kept permanent. There should certainly be troops In the island, and It i* wise that these troops should bo themselves nptlve Porto Ricans. It would be from every stand point a mistake not 10 perpetuate this regiment. In traversing the Island even the most cursory survey leaves the beholder struck with the evi dent rapid growth In the culture both of th*» sugar rann and tobarrn. The fruit Industry li also growing. Lost year was the most prosper ous year that the Island has ever known before or since Use American norupr-tipr.. Th« total of exports and Imports of thf> island was forty* five millions of dollars, as against elght^n mill ions In 1901. This '.* the largest in the island's history. Prior to the American occupation tho ■rsatsst trade for any one year was that of IR9<», when It reached nearly twenty-three mill ions of dollars. La?t year, • -.fore. th"re was doubl» the trad« that there was in the most prosperous year under the Spanish retime. There were 210.273 tons of sugar exported last year, of the value of SH.lStf.Blo: 53.55Q.168 of tobarco and 2H,29QJt22 pounds of coffee, of the value of 13.481.102. Unfortunately, what used to 'be Porto Rioo's prime crop — coffee — not chared this prosperity. It has nevnr recovered from the disaster of th« hurricane, and, more over, the henefit of throwing open our market to it has not compensated for the loss inflicted 'by the closing of the markets to II abroad. I call your attention to the accompanying- memo rial "ii this Rul^jisct of the Board of Trade of San Juan, and [cam hope thai some meas ure will he taken nVr the bon"f.t of the excellent arid hiph grade Petto EUcan coffee. In addition to delegations from The Board of Trade ar.d Chamber of Commerce of San Juan. I also received deletra-tlons from thr- Porto Rican Fedtratinn of Labor am! from the Coff«* Grow ers* Association. SHOULD HAVK FT7LL. CITIZENSHIP- There is a matter to which I wish to call your pp«"<i^l attention, and that Is the desirability of conferring full American citizenship uj>on tha people of Porto Ilico. I most earnestly hope that this will be don*. I cannot see how any harm can possibly result from it, and fit seems to me a matter of right and justice to the people of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to be umle.r our flag, they are making rapid progress alor.g the path of orderly liberty. Burely we should show our appreciation of them. our priflo In what they have lone ajid our pleasure In extending recognition for what has thus been done by granting them full American citizenship. Under th» wire administration of the present lOm-ernor and council, marked progress bas been 1 m&/i* in Ilie difficult matit-r of granting to the people of the. island th«» largest measure tit self proverrmerit that <-an with safety be given at the present time. It would have bw-n ■ very serious mistake to have gone any faster than we have aJreafiy pono in ihte direction.

I^ is not a power with which it would be safe, for the sake of the island itself, to dispense at present. The lower house is absolutely elective, while the upper house is appointive. This scheme is work ing well: no injustice of any kind results from It. and Kivat benefit to the island, and it should certainly not be changed at this time. The ma chinery of the elections is administered entirely by the Porto Rlcan people themselves, the Gov ernor and Council keeping only such supervi sion as is necessary In order to Insure an orderly election. Any protest as to electoral frauds Is settled In the courts. Here again it would not be safe to make any change In the present bvs tem. The elections this year were absolutely orderly, unaccompanied by any disturbance: and no protest has been mode against the manage ment of the elections, although three contests are threatened where- the majorities were very small arid error was claimed; the contests, of course, to be settled In the courts. In short, the Governor and Council are co-operating with all of the most enlightened and most patriotic of tho people of Porto Rico in educating the citizens of the Island in the principles of orderly liberty. They are providing a government based upon earh citizen's self-respect, and the mutual respect of all citizens; that Is, based upon a rigid observance of the principles of justice and honesty. It has not been easy to Instil into the minds of people unaccustomed to the exercise of freedom the two basic principles of our Ameri can system; the principle thnt the majority must rule, and the principle that the minority has rights which must not be disregarded or trampled upon. Yet real progress has been made in having these principles accepted as ele mentary, as the foundations of successful self government. I transmit herewith the report of the Gov ernor of Porto Rico, sent to the President through the Secretary of State. All the Insular governments should be placed !n one bureau, either In the Department of "War or the Department of State. It is a mistake not so to arrange our handling of these islands at "Washington as to be able to take advantage of the experience gained in one when dealing with tho problems that from time to time arise In another. In conclusion let me express my admiration for the work done by the Congress when it enacted the law under which the island Is now being administered. After seeing the island per sonally, and after five years' experience In con nection with Its administration. It is but fair to those who devised this law to say that it would be wellnigh impossible to have devised any other which in the actual working would have accomplished better results.

YORK DAILY TRTBTTNE. WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 12. 1906. ATTACK ON MR. SMOOT. CASE IP TS THE SEXATE. Speech Made bjf Mr. Burrows—Vote on Resolution Xot IJkehi. IFrom Th« Trlh'ine Bureau. l "Washington. Dec. 11. — Senator Burrows deliv ered an extended set speech In the Senate to da- I.1 '. advocating that the Senate declare vacant the seat of Senator Reed Smoot. of T'tah. in ac cordance, with the recommendations of the ma jority report of the Committee on Privileges and Elections, of which Mr. Burrows Is chairman. The resolution recommended by a majority of the committee reads: Resolved, That Reed Smoot la not entitled to a seat as a Senator from the State of Utah. Voting for thi3 report with the chairman were Senators Depew. Dolllver and the Democratic members of the committee, whiie a minority report, signed by Senators Foraker, Bevetidge. DilUngham. Hopkins and Knox, declares that no ground can be found for depriving Senator Smoot of his seat. The, indications are strong that were the Senate to vote on the question the minority report would be adopted. Senator Burrows, in the beginning of his re port, exonerated Mr. Smoot from all charges of polgyamy and gave tha Senator from Utah an excellent certificate of character, but declared It to be the conviction of a majority of the TWO NEW FEDERAL APPOINTEES. HERBERT K. SMTTH. Commissioner of Corporations. committee that by reason of the fact that Mr. Smoot was an official of the Mormon Church, Which appeared to have countenanced polygamy since the "manifesto." and as such officer had voted for officers In that Church who were known to practise polygamy, he was not qual ified to represent his state as a Senator. Senator Dubole, of Montana, who Is, perhaps, tho bitterest opponent of Senator Smoot and of the Mormon Church in the Senate, will speak In support of the majority report, and Senators Foraker and Beveridge will speak In favor of the views nf the minority. The minority report is regarded as showing that there Is nothing In the oath which Senator Smoot took as an apostle of the Mormon Church which Is Incompatible with his oath aa a United States Senator. It deals extensively with the charge of the Burrows re port that Senator Smoot countenanced polygamy by voting for officers who were guilty of that violation of the federal law, and finds therein no ground sufficient to disqualify Mr. Bmoot from holding his office as Senator. The leaders of the Senate do not. however, ex pert that the question whether or not Senator Smoot shall be allowed to retain hla seat will over conic to a vote, and It Is assumed that after both sides to the controversy shall have ex pro—ad their views, and Senator Smoot has re plied to the charge* o f tho majority on the floor of the Senate, the entire affair will be permitted to go to the calendar as unfinished business, there to rest for all time. Senator Burrows spoke to a well filled chamber and crowded gal leries, "Mark Twain" being one of the listeners. After discussing the political powers of tho twelve apostles of the church, of whom Mr. Bmoot is one. and declaring that there was Indubitable proof that the majority of them practised polygamy, he took up tho subject of Mr. Bmoot's connection with that body. "The vital question, therefore, is," he said, "can one become a member of and identify him self with a bund of lawbreakers, knowing them to be puch, participate in their counsels, and sustain them in their conferences, and yet escape all responsibility for thx-ir unlawful acts? Bucta a contention will not stand the test of either law or reason. Tho Senator's complicity in encour aging polygamy and polygamous cohabitation does not consist wholly In th»< fact that he ts one of the governing body of that church. By re peated acts he has. as »i member <>f the quorum of the twelve apostles, given active aid and support to tho hierarchy in Its defiance of the statutes <>f this state and the laws of common decency, and In its encouragement of polygamous practices, by both precept and example." ERIE CANAL PROGRESS. Colonel Symons Thinks Work Should Be Done in Seven Years. fFrom Th« Tribune Pin ■ :. | Washington. Dec. 11.— Forty per cent of th« work on the Erie Canal will bo contracted for by the first of the year, according to Colonel Thomas W. Bymons, U. B. a., the engineer in charge of con struction, who Is In Washington. Colonel Bymons was a caller nt the White House, to-day, and after Yip left the President* office said that work on the tremendous project is progressing satisfactorily. "The canal ought not to require, more than seven wean to complete at the outside." said Colonel Rymons "l T nlesß w« meet some very serious and unexpected obstacles, I believe the. work will r>« done feforo the expiration of that time. Few persona who have not Riven the subject of tho Kri>i (anal tome study have any Idea of th« Immense project we have undertaken It will ho of far more Im portance than the Panama Canal, both from the point of view of the volume of shipping thai will fans through after completion and the engineering; difficulties that are to he overcome while It is building. When completed it will be more than four hundred miles long."

XOMIXATIOXS GO OVER. Some Objections to Him and to A. W. Cooley Made. [From Th. Trlbuni Bureau] Washington. Dee. 11.— The Senate In secret session again held up to-day the nomination of "William H, Moody for tho Supreme Court, al though it was agreed that a vote should be CHARLES R. SKINXER. Assistant Appraiser at New York. taken to-morrow. Objection to confirmation was made by Benators Culberaon and Oarmack on the frround that Mr. Moody, when a member of the House, had introduced a bill providing that those states which deprived th« Nepro of the right of suffrage should thereby forfeit part of their representation In the House. The Sena tors named asked time to Investigate Mr. Moody*« views In this regard, and on condition that there would be no objection to a vote on h!s nomination to-morrow, th« time was granted. Of curse, those nominations for the Cabinet whlrh are dependent on Mr. Moody's transfer to the Supremo Court were also permitted to go over. The nomination of Alford W. Cooley as As- Pistant Attorney General was also held up. some Senators expressing a desire to Investigate cer tain charges before action was taken. This re sulted] in holding up tho nomination of Mr. Mcllhenny as Civil Service Commissioner to succeed Mr. Cooley. Another nomination J*ld up was that of Thomas I. Chatfleld, as Judge of the Eastern District of New York, to succeed Edward B. Thomas. Objection to Mr. Chatfleld's nomina tion rests on the ground that the place now oc cupied by Judge Thomas Is not vacant, and that the nomination merely refers to the present In cumbent as "to retire soon." It Is maintained that the nomination should give the exact date of the retirement of the present Incumbent, in order that at no time may there be two Judges of the Eastern District and no legal complica tions may ensue. Before this nomination again comes up for action, some member of the Ju diciary Committee will see the President and ascertain the date of Judge Thomas's retire ment, so that the confirmation of Judge Chat field may read as from a specific date. Objection of a similar character was raised in the Finance Committee when the nominations of George B. Cortelyou, for Secretary of the Treas ury, and James It. Qarfleld, for Secretary of the Interior, came up for consideration. There Is no opposition to either candidate, but before an other meeting of the Finance Committee one or more of Its members will see the President and ascertain the date on which these confirmations are to be made effective. There Is, moreover, an objection to confirming members of the Cab inet so far In advance of the time when It Is assumed they will take office, and an Intimation Will be made to the President, that it would. In the future, he better to withhold nominations until the date of proposed changes approaches. In reference to the criticisms made yesterday in the Senate upon his attitude toward trusts. Secretary Bonaparte to-day paid: T did not attend the conference held at Chi cago In 1860, to which reference has been made in some press dispatches, and consequently made no address there. The quotations published as excerpts from this supposed address are probably answers to certain printed questions sent to me and to a great many other persons by those who organized the conference, and to which I re member sending replies. This Is all I care to say on the subject, to which. I must own. I have given but little thought. Several hundred nominations, most of them for naval officers, were confirmed. Among th* naval nominations thus favorably disposed of •were those of Pay Director Eustace B. Rogers, to he paymaster general and chief of the bureau of supplies and accounts In the department of the Navy, with the rank of rear admiral for a term of four years, and of a large number of officers retired with Increased rank under the Naval Appropriation bill of last session. The other confirmations include the following: Joseph Bufßngton, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge for the 3d Judicial Circuit: James 1,. M.i it United States District Judge for Vermont; Nathaniel Kwing. United States District Judge for the Western District of Penn sylvania. Charles H. P.obb. of Vermont, associate Justice of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. XO
