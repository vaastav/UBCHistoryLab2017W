Grant seconded the motion COMMISSIONER COHNS PROTEST Then it was that Mr Cohn arose to make a feV remarks He was slow and deliberate in his speech and as a re sult the following is a verbatim copy of his remarks Mr Chairman said Mr Cohn I did not oppose going into executive session because there was no need for me to oppose it I have not objected to your action because there was no use in my doing so neither is there now save to place myself on record You gentlemen have no doubt consulted to gether on this matter You did not do me the courtesy to notify me and in vite me to take part in your delibera tions If you did your messenger failed to notify me or deliver your message and your apology is ac c opted I wish to say gentlemen that your action is wholly unjustifiable and with out cause for if you had cause to do what vou are now doing you could have preferred charges against the chief and tried him The very fact Here Mr Noble broke in with the remark We ais responsible for our own acts Mr Cohn Heeding the interruption not one whit Mr Cohn continued The very fact that rou have not preferred any charges shows no cause exists for your action I wish to warn vou that your act here this evening will result in litigation and I predict that the chief whom you have deposed will be re instated The city council will be noti fied that it must not pay the salary to any other officer and he will carry the matter into the courts and will be re i < < I instated some time and will receive the money due him It has been held by the courts that in discharging a member of the depart ment there must be evidence adduced to show the reason why Judge Bartch held that it was not a sufficiency of the evidence in the Gilbert case which prompted him to make a decree re instating him but the lack of it Mr Cohn then related a little law for the benefit of the commission in which he cited the functions of the board as being quasijudicial and con sequently anything which would be an error in a court of law would be an error in the commission Having fin ished his legal dissertation the speaker continued The chief will be restored I as you will see A TRIBUTE TO PRATT Let me say in conclusion that in regard to Chief Pratt I came in con tact with him for over two years in my capacity as a member of the city coun cil and a member of the committee on fire and police which then had charge 41 A1 I JOHN ESLIXGER Appointed Police Captain of the departments this commission now controls I have known him of ficially as a member of this boar since my appointment Gentlemen there has never been one irregular act that has ever attracted my attention Why he has been removed is un known to me Had you seen fit to join with me in this matter had I been consulted I might have joined with you to the extent of preferring charges As it is gentlemen I consider your action an outrage on the public Having completed his remarks the commission took a vote which resulted in the following vote Ayes Noble Dinniny and Grant 3 Noes Cohn 1 The motion was declared carried ESLINGER CAPTAIN There wad no debate on the matter of filling the vacancy of captain of po lice In the executive session

will contest the action of the board of fire and police com missioners last evening by taking it before the court for review This in tention on the Dart of the chief was outlined by Commissioner Cohn in his statement to the board It was known that this would be done ere the action was taken Chief Pratt had a long consultation with his attorney Walde mar Van Cott last Saturday at which it was agreed that the matter should be brought up in court as soon as the work of the commission was accom plished The law under which the commission acted last evening is a part of Sec 10 of the act

Soul of the Presi dentElect Another Cabinet Pos sibility In the Person of Dupont of Delaware Canton O Dec iThe burden of the talk in Canton and at the home of the presidentelect today was about Presi dent Clevelands message to congress The people about the town discussed it The visitors discussed it and some of the congressmen who were here today mildly critfclsed certain parts of it Major McKinley read it from copy furnished him by one of the telegraph companies an hour or two before con gress assembled The opening sen tence with its strong implied approval of the results of the recent election seemed full of pleasant interest for the presidentelect though he made no verbal comment upon any part of the document He read aloud parts of it to a group of friends and they com mented occasionally on some of the writers observations Major McKinley turned to the portion of the message devoted to a consideration of Cuban affairs with the keenest interest and read it aloud in clear incisive earnest I tones A congressman who was near by said President Clevelands exposition of the Cuban problem and his statement of the existing conditions is just graphic and conservative and it is much less sympathetic with the insur gents than the people hoped for I do not think his idea about home rule for Cuba will come t6 anything practi cal for the Cubans will not trust the Spanish government and would put no faith in their fairest promises Itlooks to me as though we would have to recognize the insurgents as belliger ents within 90 days Joseph B Keeling of Indianapolis called on Major McKinley tonight and discussed the political situation in In diana to some extent Mr Keeling says the impression sems to prevail that C N Fairbanks will be elected to the United States senate this winter A new cabinet possibility has swung into view this evening The name for the first time on the tongue of the co terie of official cabinet makers about Canton and Cleveland is that of Colonel Henry A Dupont of Delaware Said a friend of his tonight Colonel Dupont would make an excellent secre tary of war and under certain contin gencies may be seriously considered for the position He is a graduate of West Point served with distinction through the war and is a capable and highly successful man of affairs He is in every way qualified for this official po sition and his appointment would offend neither of the Republican fac tions in Delaware I

Message London Dec Commenting upon President Clevelands message to con gress the Standard will tomorrow say I is dignified and able and is marked throughout with sterling com mon sense It deserves and will doubt less obtain the serious study of the European powers The Standard is of the opinion that the message will excite bitterness In Spain who nevertheless must make up her mind to listen to friendly coun sel Spaniards may be excused if they detect a tone of menace The condition of Cuba will certainly not induce impar tial observers to say that menace is unwarranted The paper dwells on Mr Clevelands pointed reassertion of the Monroe doctrine in this WhateAer circumstances may arise our policy and our interests would con strain us to object to the acquisition of the island or any interference with its control by any other power I seems in this it is the intention of the United States to claim a virtual protectorate over the continent and the islands thereof This it adds is a large and bold policy that is not quite free from danger as Spain is not the only power with which the Tnited States might thereby become embroiled The paper expresses the opinion that if Spain found a powerful friend in Europe to help prevent Cuba from passing from her hands the objections of the United States based on the Monroe doctrine would not be of much account Fortunately there seems to be I no real risk that the Monroe doctrine will occasion further disputes with Great Britain In conclusion the Standard refers to the passages referring to the satisfac tory settlement of the Venezuelan dis pute and says that the dignified lan guage of the message where it refers r to Turkey shows that they can be as sured of the cordial support of the United States in executing corrective measures in that country The Daily News is chiefly impressed by the section of the message referring to Cuba I admits that the Americans cannot be permanently indifferent to Q i J the disastrous war but says that while the intentions of President Cleveland and Secretary of State Olney may be ever so good is I European opinion not favorable to the latest version of the Monroe doctrine and Spain will have some influential support if she holds out for i The Chronicle will say in a leader on the same subject that the alternative of Spain is really to either satisfy the Cubans or have Cuba taken from her forcibly In conclusion the paper says We advise Spain in her own Interest to sell Cuba quickly but he would be no friend of the United States who would advise the latter to buy the island THE NEW
