?Spirit of |effcrsim. Charlcstown, Jefferson County, West >a. TVKSDAT HORSIXG, DECEMBER 11,1817. THE PEESIDENT'S MESSAGE, The message begins, naturally enough, with a reference to tho policy adopted by the President in reference to affairs in the South ern States, and particularly to tho excellent effects which have followed from tho policy of non-interference and from the withdrawal of the troops. In theso practical fruits of his policy tho President finds his complete vindication. Tho discontinuance of (he uso of the army, he says, for ihe purposo of up holding local government in two States of the Union was no less a constitutional duty, under the eirsumstancss, than it was necessary for the restoration of local self-government and the promotion of national harmony. The result has been that tho fatal collisions be tween the races which for several years had bean of frequent occurrence, have almost en tirely ecased, political turmoil and turbulaneo have disappeared, useful industries have been resumed, public crcdit in the South has been {.really strengthened, and the benefits of a revival of commerce between the sections are more fully enjoyed. Passing next to financial topics, the Presi dent declares himself emphatically in favor of the resumption of specie payments. '"Any wavering in purposo or unsteadiness in meth ods," he declares, "so far from avoiding or reducing tho inconvenience inseparable from tho transition from an irredeemable to re deemable paper currency, would only fend to increased and prolonged disturbance in val ues, and unless retrieved must end in serious disorder, dishonor and disaster in the finan cial affairs of the government and the people." Closely allied with the question of specie resumption is that of the readjustment of our coinage system by the rcmonetizit'.on of the silver dollar, clothed by legislation with the quality of a legal-tender to a greater or less extent. This, the President reasons, would properly be a matter of legislative discretion and expediency solely, if it were not compli cated by considerations growing out of the existence or ihe public debt and tho obliga tions of national honor. "The obligation of the public faith," says the President, "trans cends all questions of profit or public advan tage otherwise." He therefore recommends that in any legislation providing for a silver coinage and imparting to it the quality of legal-tender an exception bo made in favor of tho public debt heretofore issued and now outstanding, and which shall cot be paid, principal or interest, in any coin of less commercial value than the present goM coin of tho conntry. Apart from theso considerations of public faith, as affecting the public creditor, the President expresses his utter di>tiu:>t and disbelief in any commercial ca=c or relief to be obtained from the issue of a silver coiii B20 as unlimited legal-tender. 1 nless tl.e two conditions are realized ?first, of a near approach to equality or commercial value be tween the gold and silver coinage of tho same denominations ; and sccond, of a limi tation of the amounts for which silver is to be a legal-tender, the President docs r.ot be. lieve that both can long be kept in circula tion. but that the cheaper currency wiil in evitably drive out of circulation the dearer. Without these conditions he "fears that oiiiy mischief and misfortune would fljw from a coinage of silver dollars with the quality of unlimited legal-tender, even in private trans actions." The message next takes up tiio subject of civil service reform. The President repeats somewhat vaguely anil at length, the senti ments expressed in his letter of acceptance upon this subject, and concludes by recom mending a revival of the commission ap pointed hy his predecessor to digest ruies for the regulation of the civil service of the country. The foreign relations of tl'.o United Slates present nothing of special interest at this time, not even in the caso of Mexico. The President anticipates nn trouble growing out of disturbances on the llio Grande, with nn adequate military force on our side of the river to prevent raids and punish outlaws. A brief summary is given of the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and the sec retary's recommendation that a lax cf ten cents a pound on tea and two cents a pound on coffoe should be imposed, in lieu of a number of petty and annoying internal revenue taxes which yield a less amount of revenue, is concurred in. The services rendered by the army last summer, upon the application of the authori ties of several Statas, in aid of the suppres sion of domestic riots and disturbances, are briefly alluded to. The necessity for a change in the poiicy of the government in the treatment of tho Indians is forcibly presented. The acknowl edgment is frankly made that many, if not most of our Indian wars, have bad their origin in broken pledges and acts of injus tice on the part of our own people and gov ernment, and the slow advanca made by tho Indians in civilizatii n is largely, therefore, our own fault. The passages of a law ad mitting to the benefits of the homestead act and the privilege of citizenship Indians who may bo willing to sever their tribal rela tions is recommended, as well as a more just and humane policy generally in regard to tbe Indians. Tho closing recommendation of the mcssagOj says the I3altimoro Sun, from which we con denso the above, is cno which many persons who may approve of almost everything clso the message contains will find most difficulty in approving. The President urges upon Congress tho policy and tho duty of legisla ting in aid of the States for the education of tho whole people of the country. There arc many persons who will not agreo with the President in thinking that the wisdom and necessity of such legislation is no longer a question, but who will, on the contrary, in sist that it is a matter much better left to ? the States. j VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE. Tito Virginia Legislature met on Wednes day last. Judgo Allen, ofShancndoah, re-ad juster, was elccted Speaker of the IIousc, ho being nominated in Conservative eaucas over J. Marshall Hanger, by a veto of 52 to 40 Jno. Bell Bigger was elected Clerk, and Mnj. IIill, of Albemarle, Sergant-at-arms.? The message of Gov. Kemper is an able state paper. Although he deplores tho passage of iho funding bill, he says it is tho bounden du'y of all to stand to the decision of tho highest Stato court affirming its validity, and iliat any futher agitation for tho purpose of invalidating it is a wrong to the good name of Virginia and an injury to every iutercstof tho people ; and that if thoso who seek to overthrow it fall short in any rcasonablo ef fort to meet the just demands of creditors ; if they fail to provide all tho means properly available for that purpose ; if they refuse to remedy the acknowledged defects of the pres ent revenue system, then their inaction will bo taken for repudiation, and all the jvorso be cause it will bo negative, indirect, and insid uous. In tho same connecton ho continues: To say that a State may thus retract its plighted fa'th and revoke its contract is to de stroy tho sanctity of all contract-*, to put an end to all confidence between man and man, to overturn the foundations of public and private credit, and to render the Government powerless to raise loans and maintain its ex istence in any time of emergency. Tho es tablishment of a doctrine so monstrous would bo the virtual dissolution of civilized society. He recommends a curtailment of expenses in every department of the State government, and says the accounting business has run into needless enlargement and complication, and tho Capitol is overcrowed with unneces sary officials and employees. IIo recom mends the abolishment of tho present County Court system of justices, originally appoint ed and commissioned by tho Executive, themselves filling vacancies in their own bodyi and serving without pay. congressionmTnews. Both houses of Congress met at 10 o'clock on tho 3d instant, and continued in session until 11 50, A. M , when the presiding cfii cers of each body formally announced the final adjournment of the first < r extra session of the Forty-fifth Congress. At noon both houses were again called to order, and the new session opened. Committees were ap pointed to wait upon tho President, and shortly afterwards liis annual message was presented ami read. On Friday a concurrent resolution was adopted in both houses of Congress for the adjournment of Congress front Saturday. De cember 15:h, until Monday, January 10th. The S. 0,. Tax Injunction Case. J The books in the Auditor's office sliow that j the county and di.-trict t*xes due from the i 1? &? O. u It. Company lor the years from ! 1S72 to 1S7G inclusive are unpaid. The ; Auditor was about to certify these taxes to the | Sheriffs for collcctiuu when the company ob j taincd an injunction from the United States Di.-trict Court enjoining; the Auditor and prohibiting him from certifying these taxes. A portion of these t-?ses for some of these years have no doubt been paid and the com pany is entitled to some credit. The IJaitimore and Ohio Hiilroad Cora pan}' allege, in their bill of injunction, that 1 they arc exempt from all taxation ? that, al 1 though they have paid taxes and have always : paid the State tax, they have dune so under protest. j The ease presents several interest in c qnes ; tion.1, and the first which arises is?has the United Stares Court jurisdiction ? It is claimed by the State that the 15. & O. com pany is not a foreign, but a domestic, home, corporation ; that it received its charier from the State of Virginia before the creation of West Virginia, and that this State now sus tains the same relation to the co^fcnny which was heretofore sustained by Virgi^a. Should this question be determined in favor of West Virginia, the company must then suo in the State courts. Should the decision be in fa vor of the company and the injunction be perpetuated the case will no doubt po to the Supreme Court of the United States.
