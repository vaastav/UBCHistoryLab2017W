This newspaper refuses to work jtself into hysteria or have an epi leptic fit over the Patterson impeach ment proceedings as some ol its ex citable contemporaries are doing Time will tell whether tha prosecu tor is guilty or innocent. Time will also develop the other side of the affair, for there is another side to it a side that will certainly astonish some people. In the meantime Lake county is to be congratulated that Judge Harry B. Tuthill of Michigan City i3 to try the case. He is thoroughly acquainted with condi tions in Lake County. He is a jurist of seasoned experience and it wont take him long to sift the chaff from the wheat. Whether the Patterson impeachment is to be a flash in the pan or a cause celebre will soon be settled by the Michigan City Jurist. WITH an income of more than $1,000, 000,000, a year, the govern ment is lucky to escape its own in come tax. PERHAPS . Princess de Sagan values her husband's ivory back scratcher more as an heirloom than through personal associations. BANKS NOT BITING. Once on a time, a short while ago, another enterprising gentleman came down from Chicago to make his stake In Joliet. He gathered up ac quaintances rapidly and changed his occupation easily. Business men here take notice of these people, for Joliet is so convenient to Chicago tha gentry are somewhat troublesome. He incidentally asked Mr. Red - mond of the Joliet National, after a short acquaintance, if a young man at a nearby drugstore stood well fi nancially. "Yes," was the reply, "he stands well; does as he agrees." Again ne came arouna with a couple of notes signed by the drug gist. He desired to sel these to the bank. Mr. Redmond did not want to buy. "But if I get another signer will you take them?" inquired the seller, eagerly, for he desired to get out of town that afternoon "Iso," said Mr. Redmond, "I do not want the notes at any price or with any number of endorsers, told you Mr. Evan was good on note. He is, but it is not on hi3 ac count I refuse to buy, but upon yours You have sold him something he does not fully understand and will not want, and we do not wish to be party to the transaction. We do not buy quarrels with our neighbors, at least," says the Joliet News. How different this world is today than it was yesterday. Then we were skinned every time we bought j Mf 1DAY I FROM "A SYMPHONY." Holloa, ray bully, and bang the dram! All the fua of the fair! Waxwork flgurew from palace and slum Move with a life-like air.

Iegge. a suit of clothing or a meal of victuals from a stranger. Business is getting down to a Sunday school basis. Then the banks were the best friends of lightning rod sharks and county .rights for patent hog remedies and clothes wringers. They bought the farmers' notes at splendid discounts. Confidence men used the banks for collecting agencieB and the banks collected because the notes were legal. Why, these advertising men in these days with college training and in their honesty, eloquence and en- terprse are shoving the editors over with the silly class. People read ad vertisements now to get advice, re liable history and general informa tion. IT doesn't seem exactly fair to put eleven farmers on a jury to try a horse doctor for his life. SENOR Huerta must have exer cised some self-restraint, if there are still millions in Mexico that he can help himself to. BREVITY AND BRAINS. President Wilson's message to congress occupied something less than 3,000 words. It takes a great intellect to say a great deal in a few words. And Mr. Wilson's message was devoid of the rip-snorting, whoop-la stuff about big business that used to characterize the Roosevelt messages. In fact, Mr. Wilson's message touches on this phase in a manner that must be ac ceptable to the business interests of this country. He wants to clear away the "area of doubt" as it effects the present trusts laws. We no longer have the "big stick" but we have an iron hand and the message that it penned gives good hope for the future. THE 1913 record of 135 killed and only 140 wounded seems to show that hunters are much more deadly shots than soldiers. THE Cucaracha slide is not a new- dance, despite the announcemnt that it has developed a fresh movement. THE 

NEXT STEP. Pennsylvania has passed legisla tion abolishing the public cup and the common face brush in the bar bershop. Barbers will also have to use a new towel to each customer. There has been considerable Im provement in barbershop conditions during the past ten years and there will be more during the next decade The time will come when barbers will have to have individual shaving brushes, cups, no common combs nor hairbrushes and they will have to AINDOM TrinSOa. AND FLIISOsI EVEN if we don't get a Mexican war to please the yellow Journals there, is a possible rebellion In Ulster. AS soon as Mayor Knotts of Gary goes out of office, no doubt he'll also want to join the Antl-Taggart organ ization for the suppression of boss rule. MAYOR-elect Mitchell of New York, says that he has 9,000 applicants for Jobs. If he will only give him time, Mayor-elect Johnson of Ga)ry, will catch up with him. Has applications from S.782 patriots already. WHAT with no mileage, no Christ mas recess and the pay docked of the income tax old Uncle Jone Cannon can be just as well satisfied that he got out of congress in time. PROUD President of Northwestern OF University scores the tango. HIM. Now and then a college pres ident says something good. 

BEST way to be sure that burglars won't touch your silverware is to leave your eggs on the doorstep when you go to bed. IF congress really wants to cut the high cost of living, let it take the tax oft butterlne. PRESIENT'S message urges presi dential primaries.- Jt we get 'em any American can have the honor of run ning for president, and even a precinct commltteemann can consider him self as being presidential timber. sterilize their instruments after each operation. Many malignant blood diseases have been transmitted due to an in fected razor and a slight cut. A man who gets shaved always takes more or less of a chance of contracting a loathsome disease. Sterilization of instruments and a rigid inspection by state inspectors will make barber shops more safer than they are now. And yet when we get all of theso things we will have nothing more than what the German government has in Its regulation of barbershops. 

PERHAPS congress can com promise with Dr. Cook by paying him mileage on the North Pole trip he claims to have taken. AFTER Juarez has been captured and recaptured a few more times maybe Its people will have the pres ence of mind to erect grandstands, admission gates and ticket offices. MONEY IN FARMING. An interesting story comes from North Carolina about a young farmer named J. W. Matrin, who has made a wonderful demonstration of what one man can do in the way of mak ing farming pay. Martin's farm con sists of 26 acres. Martin made $1,841 by cultivat ing three acres of wheat, six acres of oats, five acres of corn and 12 acres of cotton. "Between times" he work ed at the trade of carpenter. This is what his profit book showed: 50 bushels wheat at $1.25.$ 62.50 250 bushels oats at 75c. 167.50 10 bushels peas at $1.50.. 15.00 276.00 30.00 120.00 200.00 720.00 40.00 240 bushels corn at $1.15.. 3 tons wheat straw at $10. 8 tons peavine hay at $15. . 20 tons corn stovor at $10. 9 bales cotton with seed at $80 per bale 400 pounds pork at 10c... Made by working at car penter trade 60.00 Total $1,841.00 If a young North Carolina farmer can do that well 026 acres, what might not a young farmer do on an Indiana quarter section? Logan- sport Tribune. ANYWAY, Colonel Goethals has not shown any signs of going upon the lecture platform. ANOTHER embarrassing thing about the income tax is that it may reveal the source of some people's incomes THE SERPENT'S TONGUE. Here's a story from Kansas City says the the Richmond Palladium. ; A certain man came home from a hunting trip, found that a personal friend while at a party held in his own home had kissed his wife, sharp ened up his knife with calm deliber ateness, walked across the street to this friend's home, stabbed him to death, and is now confined In a prison cell. . A thrilling story is it not? and food for the dime novelists. But here's the key to the situa tion: "But one of the women who waa there had to tell all about it. She told someone and they told some one else and it got into the shop wuere air. u worita. There a CANADIAN PACIFIC rail way has taken out policy for $100,000,000. Bye and bye, if some of the state legis latures don't mend their ways, railways may also have to take out burglar policies. WASHINGTON dispatches say that President Wilson has taken to his bed. No wonder. What with a wedding in the family, the Mexican war scare, the tariff and the currency questions, and having to be secretary of state besides, It is enough to lay out any man. 

GOVERNMENT ALREADV HAS TAKEN 17,000 PAGES OF TYPEWRIT TEN TESTIMONY IN THE STEEL TRUST. MERCY! DIDN'T KNOW THAT F.LB GARY'S CORPORATION WAS SO BAD. IF eggs keep on increasing in price may become necessary for congress to increase the tariff on them in keeping with the government's policy of tax luxuries. KING Ferdinand of Bulgaria will be permitted to retain his throne. Lucky for him that Charles F. Murphy settled in New York instead of Sofia. MAYOR SIIAXK of Indianapolis, alno being out of office, no doubt could be indured to join the society for the sup pression of boss rule. UP to the hour of going to press Vice President Marshall hadn't bought him self a motorcycle. man C gossiped too and he told Mr. This is a fragment from the story told by the unfortunate murderer's wife before the coroner's jury. In her account the facts were divulged which were like this: She was entertaining a few friends and neighbors one evening to while away the long hours during her hus band's vacation. It happened that one of the men had been drinking and attempted to kiss her. It was about this the. woman told. The wife refrained from telling her husband for fear he might, because of the sting of the insult, attemp? violence. "But one of the women who was there had to tell about it. . . A man gossiped, too." And by the time the story reached the husband the tale had become so twisted he was told his dearest friend and neighbor had vilely insulted his wife. And the man klled his friend HOW is congress to distinguish be tween the special session and the regular session when there is no mil eage in between? 

BACK TO HIS OLD LOVE. Newspaper men are vastly Inter ested In the announcement that Col George B. Lockwood is to return to the Marion Chronicle to assume edi tonal, cnarge ot that paper once more. Col. Lockwook's determina tion will bring him congratulations from near and far. He is a veteran newspaper man and one of the most gifted editorial writers in the middle west. He is universally respected by the fraternty and his wide newspaper experience and talents used in guid ing the policies of the Chronicle will Popular Actress Now in Chicago 1 fruue. uihe-Girl of. the adJoife' Smr sk J' f''r n w push it to the front again. The newspaper is to make a number of important changes and improvements which will tend to keep it in the fore rank of Indiana Journalism. RUSSIA does not take kindly American advice. But it seems like American horses. to to AT least John Llnd might lighten the suspense by getting up and mak ing the 'announcement that he hasn't eaid anything. HOW DOES HE DO IT? We learn from Mexico City that Huerta is forcing women to serve in the army. If Huerta can handle women he ought to be able to com mand a good job in London doing a Pled Piper act with the suffregettes And if he can t land that a number of fond and loving husbands hither abouts will be pleased to learn how he does it. They will even nav a honorarium just as they ao wheif they learn tango or anything like that. 'THE girl of today conceals her ears.- wnicn, in view or what is likely to be said in her presence, Is wise precaution. And it begins to look as though the secretary of state knows as little about the president's Mexican policy as the president himself. 

"PUTTING ONE OVER." "I worked for that trust com pany for $75 a month. Thoy knew I was thirty-five years old and they ought to know that a man can't honestly live on that pay. 1 turned a trick on them and I got the best of them. That's all. And they can't get me on it, either." James Edward Foye. Thl3 is the extraordinary state ment of a man charged with stealing a half million dollars from banks and trust company by means of forged certificates. We are further told that in Phila delphia, where he got $200,000 from one bank, Foye's manner was so re assuring that the bankers did not even think to ask him who he was. Can't understand why Mr. Foye complained of the smallness ot his salary while working for the trust company. Occurs he could havs afforded to pay them a trifle for the privilege of working there. And still we wonder at crime. NOT so much is heard about the ultimate consumer these days. Probably he is busy trying to figure out how to buy $50 wrth of Christ mas presents with $10.
