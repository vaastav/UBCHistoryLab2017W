In it the President treats of interna tional mat tern, interstate affaire, the necessity of protecting the for es'., the Cotton Centennial Exposi tion, Federal protection for the peo ple, government eontrol of tho tel egraph, foreign discrimination gainst our commerce, internal im provements, the necessity for war defences, national banks and the I currency, the silver currency, the ational debt, customs and reve ues, the Mormons, etc. In sum ming up the points of the message, the Memphis Appeal thinks there much in it "that not only the Democratic but the Republican part j will dissont from. Indeed, he bill introduced in the Senate by- Senaior Edmunds, providing fir the construction of four postal tel egraph lines, is in the very teeth of 'resident Arthur's expressed oppo- linn to postal telegraphy, and this, o doulit will have the consent of a majority ot the members of both houses. What Mr. Arthur ears boat the regulation by Congress f the inter-state traffic by railroads will command attention as a tribute o the sagacity of Mr. Reagan, ot exas, who for years has prassed his matter upon the consideration fOongresa with the aid of the Democratic members of both hom es, lite radical measure t lie presi- dent suggests for the extirpation nd suppression of polygamy will halleiige the attention as really he only means left the government j o aeeoinplish that purpose, and that, will do il." In the message the President knows no North, no South. This is most commeudab.e. He is oppos ed to the too' rapid extinction of the national debt by excessive taxation. ile approves .the reduction iu in- ernal revenue taxes made by the ast Congress, anl thinks that a still greaier reduction should be made in these taxes. In reference lo the tan IT, he holds ' that the re sults ot the legislation of the last session of Congress" have not be come sufficiently apparent to justi fy any radical revision or sweeping nediScalion ot existing laws."
