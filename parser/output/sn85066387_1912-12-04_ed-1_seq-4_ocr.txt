4 AMENDMENT IS ONLY HOPE FOR CITY'S FIREMEN No Alternative to the Two Platoon System, Reports Director E. R. Zion of Efficiency Bureau MANY MERCHANTS INDORSE MEASURE Thinking Tax Payers Agree That Shorter Workday Would Be Economy No plan except the proposed • platoon amendment can be found to give the firemen 12 hours off duty out of 24. The supervisors' efficiency com mittee detailed Director E. R. Zlon of the efficiency bureau to make an in vestigation to determine whether it was possible to give the firemen additional time off duty hy some plan other than that provided in the amendment. Zion reported yesterday that he could find no alternative plan. In a written report to Supervisor Murdock, chairman of the efficiency committee, Zion states that Fire Chief Murphy informed him that the men now receive one day off out of every five, and that he sees no way for allowing any additional time off duty unless the number of men be Increased. "Under the circumstance's," concludes Zion, "I do not at present see how the time on duty can be reduced." The following excerpts from letters, favoring the passing of the amendment giving the firemen 12 hours off out of every 24, have been taken from the many thousands of letters received: N. VAN

VANITY IS EXCUSE FOR NAVY-JORDAN We Build for Show, While Fear Prompts Germany, Says Educator "Vanity Is our national excuse for maintaining a great navy, while Ger many Is building monsters of destruc tion through fear. "The white slave traffic grew up around the standing armies of the world, which are a menace to the com munity at large and are responsible for the prevalence of the red plague. "The morals of a country decline to an alarming extent following war, and the people's portion Is a heritage of evil. "It is the silliest nonsense to have soldiers stationed at San Diego and Monterey and San Francisco to repel a possible attack by orientals. The only oriental nation that could possibly be supposed to make war on the United States is Japan, and the 'terrible Jap anese' are the most gentle people on earth, except when their national ex istence is threatened." The above sentiments were promi nent in a lecture by President David Starr Jordan of Stanford uni versity at the Howard Presbyterian church last night. Doctor Jordan's ad dress was on the subject of "Peace In the Balkans." but he wandered far away from his topic at times. In the same sentence he referred to the mounted police of Canada and the ar mored dove of peace hovering over the armies of southern Europe, apparently without any intention of alighting. "The carnage in Europe Is not dis couraging to peace advocates," said Doctor Jordan. "We do not expect to establish international arbitration In a year or a century, but In time war will be abolished, simply because It will be too expensive to Indulge in. It cost $40,000 to kill one man in the Boer war. It would have been cheaper for England to have bought each Boer a nice farm in California. "The United States Is In no danger of ever again going to war. No na tion can afford to lose our commerce, because that nation Would become bankrupt fromajthat cause aldne." "The mftxlm uiat 'to prepare for war Is a safeguard to peace' was forged in hell or by military geniuses bent on covering themselves with glory," said Doctor Jordan, who then told why food prices were higher than they were 15 years ago. He said it was because taxes throughout the world had been doubled In that time to pay for the keep of great armleß and navies. The speaker said he would risk his reputation as a prophet that neither Germany nor England nor France would go to war over the trouble In the Balkans, "simply because they can not afford to." A. A.

REORGANIZATION OF PERSONNEL OF NAVY IS SOUGHT Voluminous Bill of a Revo lutionary Nature Is In troduced by Chairman of Committee CAPTAIN DOLLAR IN SENATE CONFERENCE San Franciscan Recommends Changes in Laws Affect ing Seamen WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—An amend ment offered by Republican I>ader Mann, proposing a rigid regulation of the issuance of stocks and bonds, pre vented passage by the house today of the Adamson bill that would authorise a special commission to ascertain the physical value of railroads and other Interstate carriers, with the view of aiding the interstate commerce com mission in fixing equitable freight rates. Debate on the bill, which was favor ably reported by the Interstate and foreign commerce committee atnhelast session, had been in progress nearly five hours and a vote waa about to be taken when Mann moved that the measure be sent back to the committee with instructions that lt be reported with his proposed section added. After an extended debate On a point of order against the amendment the matter went over until Thursday by unanimous con sent. Mann's amendment would prescribe In detail how an Interstate carrier should incnr Indebtedness and would prohibit the issuance of stocks, bonds or notes except in return for money or other consideration approved by the interstate commerce commission. With a permanent corps of experts inquiring into the value of carriers' property, the proposed law would make It possible for the Interstate commerce commission to fix rates on the baSis of profits to be realised on actual invest ments, instead of on paper valuations. President Taft sent more than 200 recess appointments to the senate to day and immediately indications of a movement among some of the demo cratic senators to prevent their confir mation became evident. Senator Gore, It was said, would have the active sup port of several colleagues in heading the movement. The campaign is directed especially against nominations which, it is as serted, had been postponed from time to time, thus bringing the new terms close to the beginning of the democratic ad ministration. Democratic senators say that the president already has deprived the democrats of appointing 50,000 postmasters by plating them within the civil Service law by a single or der. Most of the democratic senators ex pressed themselves as favorable to a "discriminating obstruction," but sev eral progressive senators whose assist ance had been counted on did not ap pear to be Willing to co-operate, it is said. A voluminous bill that would reor ganise the personnel of the naval estab lishment and the marine corps was In troduced today by Representative Pad- gett, chairman of the house committee on naval affairs. The bill is the result of a series of In vestigations by the democrats of the naval affairs committee and prescribes an Involved system of maintaining the quota of naval officers on a basis pro portionate with the tonnage of the navy. The measure also would change the requirement for the age limit for ad mission to the naval academy. The new measure would admit appointees only between the ages of 16 and 18. Capteln Robert Dollar of San Fran cisco, before a senate committee today recommending changes In the seamen's involuntary servitude act, declared his company. American owned, operated under the British flag 40 per cent cheaper than It could under the stars and stripes because England's laws are not so stringent. One cent letter postage within a city Where mall Is first deposited would be provided by a bill Introduced by Sena tor Penrose. The measure would ex tend the 1 cent rate now applying In towns that have no carrier delivery to all cities, restoring the general "drop letter** rate. Retirement of the president of the United States as commander In chief of the army at a salary -bf $10,000 a year was proposed In a bill by Senator Mc- Cumher. It also will pension the wid ows ot former presidents while they remain unmarried at $5,000 a year. At the instance of the navy depart ment Senator Perkins today Introduced a bill to increase the number of en listed men In the navy from 52,500 to 53,500 and to increase the enlisted strength of the marine corps 26 per cent, bringing the number up to 10,600. A resolution to direct the secretary of the treasury to deposit in national banks $50,000,000 to relieve the "sharp and active demand for money," was In troduced by Representative Levy of New York, who declared It wll prompt ed by the apparent lack of ready money In banking clrclei throughout the coun try. A bill that would establish a free mall delivery service in cities having second and third class postofflces was Introduced, today by Representative Grlest of Pennsylvania* The bill would appropriate $200,000 to be used by the postmaster general In inaugurating the Service in cities where there is now no free delivery. The bill limits the ex penditure in each city to #1,100 a year. The proposal for a separation Of the taking of the oath of office by President Wilson and the Inaugural ceremonials has been branded as "utterly foolish" by the district democratic national com mittee. It was pointed out that it would be Impossible to obtain enough money for both occasions, The commit. tee comes here, it was declared, not to witness the great pageant and social features, but for the sake of the his torical event of the swearing in of a president of the United States. Among reappointments made by President Taft during the recess of con gress and sent today to the senate for confirmation was that of Edward IS. Clark of lowa as a member of the in terstate commerce commission.

Oven Produces Weapon Deadly Cake Is Shown Solid aa the pyramids, frosted like Santa Claus, aged with months of keeping in a dark cup board, a chocolate cake, alleged to ha-re been the weapon with which William T. Martin, a chauffeur of TOO Sixth avenue, was supposed to hove attacked his wife, Alice, was the principal wltnesa in the woman's suit for divorce. Martin had kept the cake aa an exhibit to prove that he had not whirled it violently about his bead and dashed lt to the floor. The chocolate square, Ita sponge tilling petrified, was displayed to the scrutiny of Judge Thomas F. Graham. Hot a mark, one might any not even a dent, appeared in it. Ergo, the hus band argued, it waa not true that he had manhandled the cake. Judge Graham continued the case until today and suggested that any builder desiring n fancy cornerstone might apply to the court. GERVILLE-REACHE SCORES TRIUMPH St. Francis Musical Art Society Gives Enthusiastic Greeting to Singer An audience that has been criticised for frivolity and inattention accorded Mme. Gerville-Reache one of the most enthusiastic receptions of the season last evening at the fourth concert of the St. Francis Musical Art society. The members of this musical organiza tion and their guests have been ac cused times without number of a com plete lack of appreciation, but they made a brilliant exception in their greeting of the famous French-Spanish contralto. The colonial ballroom was crowded with society people and mu sicians and the occasion was marked by enough enthusiasm to cancel*all the complaints that have been registered by critics against the art society. The singer held her audience with a spell of interest from the first dramatic aria to the last encore. Through her artistic rendition of the German songs the singer won more applause from her audience than has be*en given to the German singers who have essayed to please the St. Francis audiences in other seasons. Her French songs, with the peculiar tonal quality that belongs to them and to the singer's art In her Interpretation of them, were a delight ful group, and the "Carmen" aria was a treat that convinced the audience of the charm and ability of Mme. Gerville- Reache In that role. She achieved the Illusion necessary to make her enthu siastic hearers forget the lack of scenery and stage setting that belongs to an operatic selection. Mme. Gerville- Reache will surely have a unique place In the musical and social history of St. Francis concerts. The accompanist was Gyula Ormay.

Corporal Peter Peahon did it. And he had the time of his life, too. You know a policeman's lot is not a happy one. While others, on a windy night, are cosily ensconsed in some theater witnessing an uncensored show, the policeman is guarding their homes—alert, alive and alone. From the monotony of such an event less existence Peter Peshon was snatched yesterday and borne into the Cort theater on the crest of a great moral wave. -*> Somebody had said that "The Kiss Waltz" was immoral and that the in carnadined and beauteous Valeska should be suppressed. Cqrporal Peter was the man for the job. He, if you please, passes on things ethical and esthetical. Me is what Sir Gilbert would call a superesthetlcal highly poetical person, and as such illuminates the board of censorship which under takes to keep the stage pure. PRESS AGENT SUSPECTED Via the correspondence of the Cali fornia Women's club, the chief of po lice heard Of the immorality of "The Kiss Waltz" (though personally I sus pect the show's enterprising press agent), and quick to respond to a feminine cry, Chief White called Cor poral Peter Peshon. Said he: "Mrs. Louis Hertz informs me that 'The Kiss Waltz' should be modified, its salient features of vulgarity should be eliminated, its improprieties reduced and its mad revels abated. This to the end that public indignation be as suagea and the morals of this com nunity be sustained upon that high plane of beauty and ineffable goodness for which it lt an ever has been noted"—or words to that effect. Mrs. Hertz, the chief complainant, had not seen the show, but had been informed by others who had and who were competent to know impropriety when they saw It. RESPECTABLE CURIOSITY Fortifying himself with a reperusal of Burk's essay on "The Sublime and the Beautiful," and tucking Tolstoi's 'What Is Art" in his pocket, Corporal Peter Peshon sought the advice of other experts on esthetics. E. M. Hecht and William P. Wobber, whose services in behalf of art have been manifold in their positions as members of the cen • sor board of moving pictures, wore in duced to lend the corporal their moral support, and to sit with him through the dangerous performance immune from moral contagion throug-h their stern and rockbound sense of duty, yet impelled by a respectable curiosity. In the first act they were shocked at the waltz theme because It was stolen from Mendelssohn. Climax to their consternation arose when "Ted" Lorraine as Paul (suggestive of "Three Weeks") sang a verse of "Ta- Ta, Little Girl" in French. Finally the spectacle of the countess, a married woman, flirting with a composer com pleted the counts against the show. SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED Corporal Peshon was somewhat dis appointed and said so, very frankly, to me at the end of the first act. He had not had occasion to bring forth his opera glasses once and he asked me plaintively whether the performance had been expurgated in honor of his coming. I toJd him that the only dif ference was that the audience Sunday might behave better, that last night's throng seemed in a censorious mood and that its chilly manner had faded the spirits of the fair Valeska, but that I hoped for his sake that the audience would forget his presence and liven up In the second act, which U CHAMBER DINNER TO TOP RECORDS Second Annual Banquet Monday to Be One of Biggest Organ' izatian Has Held "San Francisco—all about It" might be termed th© keynote of the second annual banquet of th© San Francisco Chamber of Commerce next Monday evening at the Palace hotel.
