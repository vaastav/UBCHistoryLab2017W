'I am now convinced that the great iniquity which bangs over thi country cannot Le purged wilhoui great bloodshed. Such, ten yeart ego, were Uie words of John Brown, as, from a Virginia scaffold, he tool his last look upon a land "fair as lh garden of the Lord," but cursed will an unnatural toil. In the light o' to-day in the light of the Litter ago nies of a terrible war in the light ol the almost miraculous cbangfi- wrought oat through bloodshed and care age the words are prophetic Three thousand Virginia military surrounded the foot of the gallows Among them, with scarlet blouse and cap, was John Wilkes Booth. Vir ginia has since had sterner work foi her 'chivalry,' and John Wilket Booth has racked his brain witl decper but who shall say darker schemes than the taking off of "Old John Brown." The prophetic vision of the stern oM man, as he mounted the scaffold, may be delineated in letters of blood in the eventful his trry of the ten years which has elaps ed since that morning, when the bay onets of Virginia, gleaming in the December sun, guarded brave John Brown, of Ossawatamie, to the con fines of another world. The battles, the sieges, the marches, the carnage and the agonies which have since swept over the land of the slave like a withering curse, are so many ful fillments ot the prophecy pronounced upon that scaffold near the little viJ lage of Chariest-own. The principle for which he died freedom to all men has since become the corner stone of our political system. A score of battle-fields stretching the breadth of the nation from Gettys burgh to Pea Ridge have added their thousands to the full measure which, in God's mysterious provi dence, was required to establish this great principle. The blood of Lin coln has oozed from the bullet hole of the assassin, in the same cause. The hutory of a decade has been concentrated in these ten yeais, yet the youngest of us, who have reached the age of maturity, may speak of them as but of yesterday. And, ere another year, the Fifteenth Amend ment will have become the funda mental law of the land, and the last remnant and relic of political bond age will be numbered with those Of its kind which have gone down before the march of events. The world moves. Ths recent completion and open ing of the Suez Canal has brought ns to the auspicious period which, "taken at the flood," may lead on to the construction of a similar work across the Isthmus of Panama. In deed, the former event resolves the latter into almost r certainty. The Pacific railway cannot compete with the Suez canal in the carrying trade ef the East, and the ocean "the highway of Nations'' will ever hold the supremacy in the matter of com merce. The canal across the Isth mus of Panama, although by no means devoid of difficulties, will be more easily constructed and ot more commercial advantage than the Su ez canaL Oar Government baa re cently eent an expedition to explore and report on the feasibility of the project, and if their report be at all favorable, we may expect a move ment toward the linking together of the two great oceans at an early day. God epeed the day, and suc cess to the enterprise. The public debt statement, for November, ehows a decrease of the public debt for the month of $7,571, 434 16 making a total decrease eince March 15th of $71,903,524 78 At this rale, by the 1st of March we shall Lave paid over ninety-six mil lions of doHars,or nearly one-twenty fourth part of the public debt. We shall be constantly decreasing the amount of interest, and have more surplus to apply to the extinguish ment of the principal, so that the consummate asses, who have solemn ly declared that the debt never could be paid, are likely to have their gra tuitous prophecies discredited. We would suggest to these prophets of ill-omen that they eschew politics and turn their attention to some more honest and less corrupting calling. They have evidently mis- capacity for weighty taken their capacity for arithmetical calculations. Judge Lewis Dskt has been de feated for Goverror of the recon structed State of Mississippi. We Lave not received such good news before, since Johnson (Andrew) was laid on the shelf by the Tennessee Legislature. Mr. Dent has played a most ridiculous and disgusting part, and should retire to private lifi but he won't Such men as he and Johnson can't be squelched. The next deal of the political pack they'll turn np somewhere. They are uneasy cut of office as a fish is out of water. Col. Alcorn, Dent's success ful competitor, was a rebel Colonel, and lost a limb in the service. He gave up when whippet!, end has heartily supported the reconstruction measures of Congress. xit Dent Messrs. Fasr k Ettikgeb have a superb stock of Gilt Books for the Holidays, as well as other nice things, See their advertisementon third page, GEORGIA AS A NULLIFIER. The sovereign State of Georgia .1- w r unuMgure thereof-has chosen to place herself in the position ol a nuililier, by dis-to wardintr one of ilia viir:a -nn,li.'8aUfciii o o f- i tions of the Reconstruction act. We!,n , , . . . -net-soi refer to the expuU.cn of the colored members of the Legislature by the Democratic majority. The iretext for this outrage was obtained in the 1 . . , . 7 1 vxeorcta cxte 01 laws, ami ttinn whs' therefore given for a decision from the highest judicial tribunal of the Sjate whose laws aflorded the pretext or the act the Suureme Court ol he State of Georgia. That ticcisiou ii tas long since been pronounced. 1 Vftera careful review of the case, hat Court has decided that colored are eligible to ofiicc. SiUl thej"1084 rrong is persisted in, and one heir journals declares that they will i tand by the position they have taken -ven "at the expense of keeping out if a sham Union." Congress maj "ecede, the people of the United States may tamely submit to the nul iBcation of a law of reconstruction, hut these devotees rnd advocates of the Georgia 6lave code of a formei lay trill not recede from the "high moral ground'' they have assumed. Planting themselves upon the central idea of the Democracy the superi ority of the Caucassian race they Jaunt the banner of caste in the face f the nation and defy the Congress under whose laws they claim to be a State, to mortal combat. Claiming to be reconstructed under a certain act of Congress, they disregard the provision which is the very essence of that act. There is but one method by which Congress can meet the issue thus forced npon it, and that is to pi o- nounce the reconstruction of that State a sham and a fraud, and place the State under military rule. The remedy is one which will be univer sally regretted; but desperate dis eases require desperate remedies, rnd the past few years have exhibited some terrible out croppiugs of that dangerous disease known as Stale Bights. The claim of certain Senators and Representatives from that State to seats in Congress will bring the ques tion before that body, and we have reason to lielieve that the Georgia nullifiers will come to grief. They will find that they must abandon the ground they have taken, or take again upon themselves that which their treason aforetime entailed npon them military rule. Congress must not hesitate in the application of this most needful remedy. t CONGRESS. body met on the inst The President's Message was received and read, meeting wiiu gcia and ordered to be printed.

ARCADIA ITEMS. Correspondence Jeffersonian. ARCADIA, O. Dec. 7, '69. Eds. Jat r : We noticed an item in last week's Courier charging the postmaster of this place Arcadia with carelessness and incompetency in the discharge of his official duties as postmaster. Now to this charge we answer most emphatically, "not guilty.'' And further, the worthy editor of the Courier says, "many of our subscrib ers have failed to get their papers when we know they were mailed.' xmow, in answer to tnis, we can unhesitatingly say that Mr. Glessner has either been misinformed or utter, aeuneraie laisenooa and we are inclined to believe it is the latter and in justification ot the assertion we will state here that we know ot several instances where patrons ol the Courier did not get their paper at this otuce, as it bad not left the Courier ofhee. One man in particular. a citizen of this place, and patron of tne Courier, did not receive his pa per for three or four weeks in suc cession, and finally waxed wroth.and declared he would go to Findlav and see who was to blame, the editor ot the Courier or the postmaster here: ana wnen ne came Daca, ne .mormed ns that the paper had not been sent out, but that our friend Glessner had neglected to send it, and would send all the missing copies together : and he did ao. And not only of carelessness of this kind is the editor of the Courier guilty, but be frequently has two pa pers addressed w the same p?rty, and to others or bis subscribers none.
