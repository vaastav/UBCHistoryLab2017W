Congress got itself into shape on the first iast, but did nothing more than organize and hear the reading of the President's message. The message is much after the fashion of such papers, and proposes nothing that will interest the public so much as the proposal to pension General Grant. In the Senate, on the 2d, a memo rial, a joint resolution, from the As sembly of Vermont, urging Congress to take control of inter-staie com merce. A resolution was ouared to rnTes ticrate the leases for erazinjr lands in the Indian territory.

On ill-? lib, iu ths Senile, a bill was introduced granting a pensiu to Genera! U. S. Grant. Senator Camcroa submit led the foil oliowiUK resolution : Y,Le;t.-.ns, The shipping trsdo in American reSsda is and ha for years been depressed, and the export trade in American produce is languishing for want of a market that might be reached if the shipping trade was in the Lunds of citizens cf the United States. Therefore ilesoived, lhst the Committee on Fiuauco be and i hereby directed to enquire w hether it would bo expe I dient to expend the surplus revenue of the United rfhiie, or any portion thereoi, fcr tho purpose of reviving the sbipjdi.g uud export trade by al lowing a rebate from tari;!' duties on foreigu gooiU imported in ships built and owned iu the United Stntes. and by also allowing a priniamou Atanr ijan grown products and articles of American vessel, and report by bill or otherwise. The resolution wa3 laid over.

Mr. xiiii uesirea the resolution to lie over for the present, and stated that he would call it up and address the Senate on the subject-matter on early opportunity. After an executive eeseion with closed doors the Senate adjourned till the 8th inei. On the 4th, in the House, when bills were called, one relative to the surplni revenue was presented and referred. The bill provides, that the Secretary of the Treasury be and he is hereby authorized and directed to apply the surplus revenue at any time in the Treasury in excess of $100,000,000, not otherwise appro priated to the redemption of United States bonds; and whan any cf said bonds are redeemable at the pleasure of the government it shall not be lawful to apply any portion of said surplus to the purchase of bonds at a premium.

Also, a resolntion asking the President to furnish cor respondence relative to the relation ship with Mexico.

A bill, to admit free of duty arti los intended for exhibition at the World's Exposition to be held by the colored race in Chicago in 1883. A Kurdcrer Haufffd In the autumn, a fiend in human form, named Howard Sullivan, a col ored man, overtook a Miss Watson while she was on a lonely road on her way from town to her country home in New Jersey, and murdered her for lust and money. He was hung ou the second inst., at Salem, N. J., and when about to be swung o3T, he asked all who hoped to meet him in heaven to raise their hands. Nearly every man prefect raised their handj. lie declared that he was about to fall into the arms of Jesus. It ia jrst such miserable spectacles s that, that gives a ghastly glory to au e78cntin in the mind of bad peo pie. If they are taught that r.fter a thieving and rpurdVrous career they can l.-o prayed into tha arms of Jesus and be eternally happy, what use is there in pursuing a correct life ? If a life in the service cf the Devil is to bs changed for a life ia glory merely by a shout or two for Jesus, the evil desires 'night as well be indulged, for if detection comes, and human society inflicts punishment, aa eter nal state of happiness awaiti the vil lain in the other world. That is about the way the thieves and mur derers argue, and that is (.hour the result of the teaching ofacertain class of theologians. Such preachers do society a great deal of harm, and they do a great injury to a certain! 'ass cf people by making them feel secure of eternal happiness regard less of what they do. Out upon such preaching and such preachers that teach that ths human fiend who lurks the roadsids and springs out upon an l ..cent iriil and violates her nsr- son and robs her of her money is a fit rtnljact for heaven. If the murderer can gt into heaven good for him, but iu the name of the commonest deceacy let us be spared ths iniliclion of a set of Theological teachsrs that attend upon the murderer and work him up to a public expression tb&the is certain to go straight to heaven from the gallows. The North American of December 3, 1884, give s au account of the exe cution of Sullivan as follows : Sal-m. N. J.. Dec 2. Early this morcitg one unacquainted with the events which were totranspiieinthis generally qmet littie town would have supposed that it was a fait' day or gaia occasion 01 simitar n.iture. Eveiy country road leading to the place was dotted uith coming wa gon auu peucsuiaDS, wruie tiie in coming railroad trains brought many other anxious, curious persons, who in common with those coining in other ways hastened to the centre of the town and gatherad around tho Court-House. The street was soon crowded. Roughly ciad farmers and laborers jostled against men who bore the appefuaucQ of merchauta and men of leisure, against half grown boys and even little children. The centre of attraction to all was the lit tie roughly-built board shed in which Howard Sullivan was to bo hanged. Iu the jail adjacent to which, the scaffold was to be erected, Sallivan sat in his room. He had gona to bed at midnight, after spending several hours in devotional exercises and singing negro melodies. "Call me about seven o'clock." betaid. During the night he awakened and ate half a mince pie, which was furnished to him, but with this exception he slept as soundly as though he had never buen branded with the mark of Cain, and was not on the threshold of death. It was a few minutesafterseven when he was awakened by the warden. His breakfast of buckwheat cakes and sausage which was brought to hiui a few moments later from the table of ex Sheriff Coles, wus the first meal of which he had eaten heartily. He did not refuse this, bat merely said Le would eat later. Early in the morning several re porters and others were admitted to see him. He talked wiiii perfectcalm- ness, and after a tune ate a nortion of the breakfast which he had declin ed at Crst. Soon afterward his father and mother came to see him, togeth er with Rev. Richard Miles, one of the colored clergymen whom ho had chosen to bo with him in his last moments. Sullivan etill maintained his calm demeanor, and during the visit of his parents parted with ap parent unconcern from Rev, T. R. Croshorn, colored, and Revs. "W. V. Louderbough and William S. Zane, white, who had visited ltim during his incarceration. At ten o'clock his two sisters, Emiiine and Kate, reach ed the town, coming, in company with several other colored people, on a train from Feu wick the nearest station to their home t Bushtown They spent a short time wit h him, and then father, mother, anil sisters turn ed to take their last farewell. The mother coiild stand it no longer, but crying out in a heart brokeu tone, fainted in the corridor. The sister Emiiine also partially fainted, but both were revived and helped into the street Here they had gone but a short distance when the mother faint ed again. She wtui picked up and ta ken into a tin shop near at baud, where she stayed until the train left, nearly two hours iater. My God ! Must I leave him ? Oh my brother ! My brother !" shrieked Emiiine a mouieut after her mother fainted. Aj she fell she was caught by hei father, who held her in his arms for some time, and then laid her on the cold brick sidewalk while be chafed her hands to revive her. She was resuscitated in about a quar ter of an hour, and taken slowly on toward the depot wuiliug and mourn ing for her brother. Meanwhile Sheiiff Kelty was rush ing nervously around, in and out of the jail, preparing for the final act It was not until the middle of the forenoon that the gallows and covered way fiotn tho jail to the building were completed, the noisy bang of hammers jarring harsh ly in the prisoner's ceil, ten feet away until it was nearly time for him to die. Almost until the time of the execution, too, the Sheriff was busy revising the list of persons who were to 1)9 admitted. Several of those who had eagerly sought this privilege a few days beforo faltered, and con cluded taut they had rathor not see the revolting n'jjht, and the names of others were substituted. The repor ters of leading daily papers who were present were, however, persistently ignored, two only gaining a Jmission. One of these succeed ad by getting a re pleat from Sheriff De B. Kiem, who had loabe 1 the Salem arthonties the gallows of Moyamensing Prison, and the other paid 2 for the privilege.

"1 can't do it. It is impossible. The list is fit!!," and the Sheriff went ha1- tily up the st t?s aud into tho ins!.

A momt-Lt later Slur. ft" Xelty walked after them, closely followed by Sal livau. who wis d.es.sed iu a new puit of black clothes proyided by ex-Sber- ia Coies. who, wita Itevs. Richard Miies and Wiisoo Peterson, both col ored, accompanied the condemned man. As Sullivan parsed the head of tho stairs he re-cogni.ed two or three persons fctaiuhug there and calmly hide them good-bye. At ths foot of the stairs he prised his coffin, which he looked nt with a serene smile, Th SiieriiTs deputies and the few newspnpr reporters win, were permitted to be present filed in aiter the party m which tho murder er walked. Sullivan with steady trend and a placid demeanor followed Sheriff Kelty up the steps to the scaffold. After prayer by Rot. Mr. Miles, Con stable Joiin M.

He was then asked by cx-Sneri'T Coles if be had anything to iay iie r??i!ied iu the alurmative, and tiien wi'.hont a tremor ia his voice spoke as fol lows : 'T say good-bye toyouall. I thank you ail for your kindness. I hope to meet you ail iu heaven, and wish that all who hope to do so would raise their bauds." Nhbi Iv evsry niaa in the room rais ed hii Land, and tho prisoner resum ed : -a ui stanuiug up nere 1.1 tl.e amis of Jeiiiis. V lien I fali don't think I fall to the earth.

I dou't want to wait long, for tiie bridar oom has prepar ed a feist for me end I want to be there to partake of it. Just complete the preparations for I am to fali into the aims of Jesus." He theu bade a bmiliug good-bye to his ministerial friends and to ex Sheriff Coles, who as fur as a noble man could be a fneud, to such a wretch, had been Lis stauuch friciid from first to lui. The cap was drwa over his face and he called out, '-Good- bya, good bye I fall be to tho arms of Jesn." At twenty bine minutes past eleven Sheriff Kelty pulled tho bolt and the trap fell wilh n heavy clang, plainly heard in the street and through the jail. The body turned slowly with the tautening of the rope, but there wm no other motion. The neck of Howard Sullivan was broken, and the law had avenged the murder of Ella Watson. After banging one minute and ten seconds there was a slight convulsion. That was all. At four niinntes past twelve the body was cut down and given into the charare of Undertaker Turner, the relatives hay ing filed a bond that they would not open the coffin or have a public fun eral, and later in tha day the murder er's clay was returned to its native earth in the Bunbtown graveyard.
