Washington, Dec. 7. Following Is the final message of President Cleve land to congress: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives of the people in the legislative branch of their government you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citl 7ens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political con teat Involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating aggressiveness so Intense as to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suffrage without dis turbance of our tranquillity or the least sign of weakness in our national struct ure. When we consider these Incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have suc ceeded a heated clash of political opin ions we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will, and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith In the agencies established. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service In their behalf as can only be prompt ed by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the accept ance of public duty invites. Refers to the Unspeakable Turk. The president then says that in obed ience to constitutional requirement he aubmits certain information as to na tional affairs with such suggestions as his Judgment approves, and that he hall omit details regarding domestic and foreign matters that are contained in departmental and other reports sub mitted to congress. He then refers to Turkey and the Armenians, stating that he would like to assure congress that the European powers having treaty rights to interfere had miti gated the shocking features of the situ ation. This he says has not been done and that reports of bloody butcheries are still all too frequent. With refer ence to our own action he says we have left nothing undone to protect those coming under our care, and that our efforts will not be relaxed. The claim of American citizens for Indemnity for loss of property will be pressed, although the validity of these demands has not been admitted by Turkey, in spite of the strongest evi dence of the actual complicity of Turk ish soldiers in the destruction. Happily no American life has been taken, lie closes as follows on the subject: I do not believe that the present omber prospect in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Chris tendom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century that I it seems hardly possible that the earn- ! est dtmand of good people throughout j the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered. 

TACKLKS THE ClilAX QLlTION. Not Much Comfort for the Follower of Muceo ami (iomez, The president then takes up the Cu ban question, and says: The Insurrection in Cuba still con tinues with all Its perplexities. It is difficult to see that any progress has thus far been made towards the pacifi cation of the island or that the situa tion of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least Im proved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the considera ble towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the In land country. If the determination of Spain to put down the Insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, and Jsevlnced by her unhesl of time, and Is evinced by her unhesl rnilllary and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the Insurgent have gained In point of numlxrs and character and resources, and are none the less inflexible In their resolve not to succumb without prac tically securing the great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the Insur gents yet made good their title to be regarded as an Independent state. In deed, an the contest has gone on the pretense that civil government exists n the island, except bo far as Spain is able to maintain It, has leen prac tically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more or less Imperfectly, In the large towns and their immediate suburbs. Rut that ex ception being made, th entire country Is either given over to anarchy or Is subject to the military occupation of on or the other party. It is reported. Indeed, on reliable authority that at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the Insurgent army the putative Cuban government has now given up an attempt to exercise Its functions, leaving that government confessedly (what there Is the best reason for sup posing It always to have been. In fact.) a government merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists In the open or pitched bat tle promptand decisive resultsmlght be looked for, and the Immense superior ity of the Spanish forces In numbers, discipline and equipments could hardly fall to tell greatly to their advantage. Put they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose Its own ground, that from the nature of the country la visible or invisible at pleas ure, and that rights only from ambus cade, and when all the advantage of position and numbers are on 'Its side. In a country where all that Is indis pensable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily ob tainable, especially by those born nnd bred on the soil, it Is obvious that thore is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as In all cose? cf protracted civil strife. the passlonsof the combatants grow more and more Inflamed and excesses on both side be come more frequent and more deplora ble. They are also participated In by bands of marauders who, now In ths name of one party and now in tn narw of the other, as may best suit the occasion, harry the country at will and plunder Its wretched Inhabitant lor their own udv&hti.;. i . ; uh a won ditloit of things would itn vluhly en'all Immense destruction -f property, even If It was the policy of both parties to prevent It as far us piac-ttcable. Hut while such seemed to be the original policy of the bpanlsh government K has now apparently abandoned it. and Is acting upon the tame theory as the Insurgents, namely: that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property that It may not prove of use and advantage of the enemy. The president then goes on to say that the result of this policy will be the ruin of the entire island, and refers to our money Interest in Cuba, esti mated at from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000: also to the difficulty and cost of pre venting filibustering, with the people's sympathies all with the rebels, together with the continual appeals for the pro tection by the United States of Cuban Americans. He says that the United States has been very forbearing in the matter, and that no other nation would have stood off so long. He continues as follows: It was at first proposed that belllger ent rights should be accorded to the Insurgents a proposition no longer urged because untimely and in practical operation clearly perilous and injurious to our own Interests. It has since been and is now sometimes contended that the independence of the insurgents should be recognized.. Rut Imperfect and restricted as the Spanish govern ment on the island may be no other exists there unless the will of the mili tary officer In temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as a specJes of government. It Is now also suggested that the United States should buy the Island a suggestion possibly worthy, of consideration If there were any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is urged finally, that all other metods failing, the existing Inter necine strife In Cuba should be ter minated by our Intervention, even at the cost of a war between the United States and Spain a war which its ad vocates confidently prophesy could be neither large In its proportions nor doubtful in its issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither afllrmed nor denied. The United States has nevertheless a char acter to maintain as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the rule of Its con duct. Proceeding the president refers to the determination of Spain to insist that the rebels shall lay down their arms be fore she grants the reforms which he gives her credit for being willing to grant, and thinks that determination not reasonable and adds: It was Intimated by this government to the government of Spain some months ago that if a satisfactory meas ure of home rule were tendered the Cu ban Insurgents and would be accepted by them upon a guaranty of Its execu tlon, the United States would endeavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. While no definite response to this intimation has yet been received from the Spanish government, it is believed to be not al together unwelcome, while no reason Is perceived why It should not be ap proved by the Insurgents. Whatever circumstances may arise our policy and our Interests would con strain us to object to the acquisition of the island or the Interference with Its control by any other power. It should be added that It cannot be reasonably, assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be Indefinitely maintained When the inability of Spain to deal success fully with the insurrection has become manifest, and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty Is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for Its re-establishment has degenerated Into a strife which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented In which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be su perseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. Deferring the choke of ways and methods until the time for action ar rives, we should make them depend upon the precise conditions then exist ing: and they should not be deter mined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration Involving our honor and interest, or the interna tional duty we owe to Spain. Until we face" the contingencies suggested, or the situation is by other incidents Im peratively changed, we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pur sued, thus In all circumstances exhib iting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position we occupy In the family of nations. 

VENZL'KLAN IWH NDAKY JLITION. Ad Incident That 1h Nearly Cloied Some Talk About SeaU. - The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference between Great Rritain and the United States, their respective governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the whole controversy to arbitration. The provisions of the treaty are so eminent ly Just and fair, that the assent of Ven ezuela thereto may confidently be an ticipated. Negotiations for a treaty of general arbitration for all differences between Great Britain and the United States are far advanced and promise to reach a successful cansummation at an early date. With the foregoing the whole sub ject I dismissed and the president takes up the subject of reform In the consular service, which he advocates on merit system lines, and also urges the providing of residences for our ambassadors abroad. Then he takes up the seal question and says: We have during the past year la bored faithfully and against unfavora ble conditions to secure better preser vation of seal life In the Rehrlng sea. Both the United States and Great Brit ain have lately dispatched commission ers to these waters to study the habits and condition of the seal herd and the causes of their rapid decrease. Upon the reports of these commissioners, soon to be submitted, and with the ex ercise of patience and good sense on the part of all Interested parties. It Is earnestly hoped that hearty co-operation may be secured for the protection against threatened extinction of seal life in the northern Pacific and Behrlng sea. SriMKCT OF 

CRKAT IXTKKKST Taken L'p the Tariff and Argues lu Favor of the Wilson Mill. The president next takes up domestic finance and prefaces his suggestions with a statement of the national bal ance sheet, and of collecting the rev enue, exports of gold and imports of same, together with the production of precious metals at home and abroad. He shows a deficit for the year of $2.', 20.1,213.70. He then refers to all the de partments of government in turn and finally takes up the tariff as follows: 1 nesire to recur to the statements elsewhere made concerning the govern ments's receipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and Its operation. This statute took effect on the 2Gth day of August, 1894. Whatevtr may be Its shortcomings aS t complete mtfaeure of tariff reform tt must be conceded that It has opened tht way to a freer and greater exehzrt-e cf commodities between us and other countries, and thus furnished a wider market for our products ' and manu factures. The only entire fiscal year during which this law has teen in force ended on the 30th day of June. 1836. In that year our Imports increased over those of the previous year more than $6,LOO,000, while the value of the do mestic products we exported and which found markets abroad was nearly $70, 000,000 more than during the preceding year. Those who Insist that the cost to out people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be Increased through tariff charges to an extent necessary to meet the ex penses of the government, as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and with the additional purpose of so In creasing their price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and producers better and more profitable opportunities, must agree that our tar iff laws are only primarily Justified as sources of revenue to enable the gov ernment to meet the necessary expenses of Its maintenance. Considered as to its sufficiency In this respect the pres ent law can by no means fall under Just condemnation. During the only com plete fiscal year of its operation it has yielded nearly $8,000,000 more revenue than was received from tariff duties In the preceding year. There was, nevertheless, a deficit be tween our receipts and expenditures of a little more than 25.000.000. This, however, was not ur -ctfd. The sit uation was sm h I v ?c ember, seven months before the 'e of the fiscal year, that the secretary of the treasury foretold a deficiency of JlT.OuO.OOO. The great and increasing apprehension and timidity in business elides and the de pression in all activities intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or Its operation, seriously checked the Im ports we would have otherwise re ceived, and readily account for the dif ference between this estimate of the secretary and the actual deficiency, as well as for a continued deficit. Indeed, It must be confessed that we could hardly have had a more unfavorable period than the last two years for the collection of tariff revenue. We can not reasonably hope that our recupera tion from this business depression will be sudden, but It has already set In with a promise of acceleration and con tinuance. I believe our present tariff law, If al lowed a fair opportunity, will In the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonable economical expenditures, will overcome all deficiencies. In the meantime no deficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any such deficit we have in the treasury. In addition to a gold reserve of $100,000,000. a surplus of more than $128,000,000 applicable to the pay ment of the expenses of the govern ment, and which must, unless expend ed for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or if not extravagantly wasted must In any event be perverted from the purpose of Its exaction from our people. The payment, therefore, of any deficiency In the revenue from this fund Is nothing more than Its proper and legitimate use. The government thus applying a sur plus fortunately In Its treasury to the payment of expenses not met by Its current revenues is not at all to be likened to a man living beyond his in come and thus incurring debt or en croaching on its principal. It is not one of the functions of our government to accumulate and make additions to a fund not needed for immediate expen dlture. With individuals it is the chief object of struggle ami effort. The ap plication of an accumulated fund by the government to the payment of Its running expenses Is a duty. An Indl vidual living' beyond his income and embarrassing himself with debt, or drawing upon his accumulated fund of principal Is either unfortunate or Im provident. The distinction Is between a government charged with the duty of expending for the benefit of the peo pie and for proper purposes all the money It receives from any source, and the individual who is expected to mani fest a natural desire to aviod debt or to accumlate as much as possible, and to live within the income derived from such accumulations, to the end that they may be Increased, or at least re main unimpaired for the future, use and enjoyment of himself and the ob Jects of his love and affection who may survive him. It Is Immeasurably better to appro prlate our surplus to the payment of justifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to reckless appro priations and extravagant expendi tures. I suppose It will not be denied that under the present law our people obtain the necessaries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate than for merly. This Is a matter of supreme Im portance, since It is the palpable duty of every Just government to make the burdens of taxation as light as possi ble. The people should not be required to relinquish this privilege . of cheap living except under the stress of their government's necessity made plainly manifest. 

DISCUSSES FINANCIAL AFFAIRS And Repeats That the Remedy la the lie tlrement of Greenback. This reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues naturally suggests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods. They have been frequently pressed Upon the attention of -congress in pre vious executive communications - and the inevitable danger of their continued toleration pointed out. Without now repeating these details I cannot refrain from again earnestly presenting the necessity of the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance, and shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and per plexity. The terrible civil war which shook the foundations of our govern ment more than thirty years ago brought in its train the destruction of property, the wasting of our coun try s substance and the estrangement of brethren. These are now past and forgotten. Kven the distressing loss of life the conflict entailed is but a sac red memory, which fosters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a tender re gard for those who nobly died. Ana yet there remains with us todav. In full strength and activity, as an In cident of that tremendous struggle, a feature of Its financial necessities not only unsulted to our present circum stances but manifestly a disturbing menace to business security and an ever-present agent of monetary dis tress. Jiecause we may be enjoying a temporary relief from Its depressing in fluence, this should not lull us Into a false security nor lead us to forget the suddenness of past visitations. I am more convinced than evr that we can have no assured financial peace and safety until the government currency obligations upon which gold may be demanded from the treasury are with drawn from circulation and cancelled. This might be done, as has been here tofore recommended, by their exchange for long term bonds bearing a low rate of Interest, or by their redemption with the proceeds of such bonds. Kven if only the United States notes known as greenbacks were thus re tired it is probable that the treasury Cates Issued In payment of silver pur .harts under the act of July 14, US 3, Cow paid In gold when demanded, aould not create much disturbance, aa tfcey might from time to time, when ecelved In the treasury by redemption tn &old or otherwise, be gradually and prudently replaced by silver coin. This plan of Issuing bonds for the purpose tf redemption certainly appears to be the most effective und direct path to the needed reform. In default of this. However, it would be a step In the right direction If currency obligations re deemable In gold, whenever so re deemed, should be cancelled Instead of being reissued. This operation would be a flow remedy, but It would Im prove pretent conditions. National tanks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to issue circu lation to the par value of bonds depos ited as security for Its redemption, and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of 1 per cent. In considering projects of the retire ment of United States notes and treas ury notes Issued under the law of 1890. 1 am of the opinion that we have placed too much stress upon the dan ger of contracting the currency, and have calculated tod little upon the gold that would be added to our circulation if Invited to us by better and safer financial methods. It is not so much a contraction of our currency that should be avoided as its unequal dls- trlbution. This might be obviated, and ; any fear of harmful contraction at the same time removed, by allowing the organization of smaller banks in less populous communities than are now permitted, and also authorizing exist ing banks to establish branches In small communities under proper re strictions. The entire case may be presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial methods will not dawn upon us until our government abandons the banking business and the accumulation of funds, and confines Its monetary operations to the receipt of the money contributed by the people for its support, and to the expenditure of such money for the people's benefit. Our business interests and all good cit izens long for rest from feverish agita tion, and the Inauguration by. the gov ernment of a, reformed financial policy which will encourage enterprise and make certain the rewards of labor and Industry. Statistic Olveu by the President. The statistics of national Income and outgo, etc., given by the president are as follows: The secretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1806, the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to $409,475, 408.78. During the same period Its ex penditures were $434,678,054.48. the ex cess of expenditures over receipts thus amounting to $25,203,245.70. The ordi nary expenditures during the year were $4,015,852.21 less than during the preced lng fiscal year. Of the receipts men tioned there was derived from customs the sum of $180,021,751.67, and from in ternal revenue $146,830,615.66. The re ceipts from customs show an increase of $7,863,134.22 over those from the same source for the fiscal year ended June 30,1890, and the receipts from internal revenue an Increase of $3,584,537.91. The value of our imported dutiable merchandise during the last fiscal year was $369,757,470, and the value of free goods Imported $409,967,470, being an In crease of $6,523,675 In the value of dutla ble goods and $41,231,034 In the value of free goods over the preceding year. Our exports of merchandise, foreign and do mestlc, amounted in value to $882,606,- 938, being an Increase over the preced lng year of $75,068,773. The average ad valorum duty paid on dutiable goods Imported during the year was 39.94 per cent., and on free and dutiable goods taken together 20.5u per cent. The cost of collecting our Internal revenue was 2.78 per cent., as against 2.81 per cent, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1835. The total production of distilled spirits, exclusive of fruit bran dies, was 88.588,703 taxable gallons, be lng an Increase of 6,639,108 gallons over the preceding year. There was also an Increase of 1,443,676 gallons of spirits produced from fruit, as compared with the preceding year. The number of bar rels of beer produced was 35.859,250. as against 33.589,784 produced In the pre ceding fiscal year, being an Increase of 2,269,466 barrels. The total amount of gold exported during the last fiscal year was $112,409, 947 and of silver $60,541,670. being an increase of $4o.941.466 of gold and $13. 246,384 of sliver over the exportatlons of the preceding fiscal year. The Imports of gold were $33,525,065 and of silver $28,777.1S6. being $2,589,695 less of gold and $8,506,007 more of silver than dur ing the preceding year. The total stock of metallic money In the United States at the close of the last fiscal year. ended on the 20th day of June. 1896. was $1,228,326,035. of which $599,597,964 was In gold, and $628,728,0il in silver. On the 1st day of November, 1896, the total stock of money of all kinds in the country was $2,285,410,590 and the amount in circulation, not including that in the treasury holdings, was $1, 627,055.611, being $22.63 per capita upon an estimated population of 71.902,000. The production of the precious metals In the United States during the cal endar year 1895 is estimated to have been 2,254.760 fine ounces of gold, of the value of $46,610,000. and 55,727,000 fine ounces of silver, of the commercial value of $36,445,000 and the coinage value of $72,051,000. The estimated production of these metals throughout the world during the same period was 9,688.821 fine ounces of gold, amounting to $200,285,700 In value, and 169,189,249 fine ounces of sil ver, of the commercial value of $110, 654.000 and of the coinage valueof $218. 73. 100 according to our ratio. These coinage of these metals In the various countries of the world during the same calendar year amounted to $232,701,438 In gold and $121,996,219 In sil ver. The total outstanding circulating notes of all national banks on the 31st day of October, 1896, amounted to $234, 553.807. Including unredeemed but fully secured notes of banks Insolvent and In process of liquidation. The Increase in national bank circulation during the year ending on that day was $21,099, 429. On Oct. 6. 1896, when the condition of national banks was last reported, the total resources of the 3,679 active Institutions was $3,263,685,313.83. which Included $1,893,268,839.31 In loans and discounts and $362,165,738.85 in money of all kinds on hand. Of their liabili ties $1,597,891,058.03 was due to Individ ual depositors and $209,944,019 consisted of outstanding circulating notes. 

TAKES A WHACK AT TRUSTS. Recommend That Congress Legislate for Their Control. Another toplo In which our people rightfully take a deep Interest may be here briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and other huge ag gregations of capital the object of which is to secure the monopoly of some par tlcular branch of trade. Industry or commerce, and so stifle wholesome com petition. When these are defended It Is usually on the ground that though they Increase profits they also reduce prices and thus may benefit the pub lic It must be remembered, however, that a reduction of prices to the peo ple is not one of the real objects of the,? organizations, nor Is their ten envy necessarily In that direction. If It occurs In a particular case It Is only Picause It accords with the purpose or Interest of those managing the scheme. Cuch occasional results fall far short of compensating the palpable evils charged to the account of trusts and monopolies. Their tendency Is to crush out Individual Independence and to hinder or prevent the free use of hu man faculties and the full development of human character. Through them the farmer, the artisan and the small trader Is In danger of dlslodgement from the proud position of being his own master, watchful of all that touches his coun tiy's prosperity, in which he has an individual lot, and Interested In all that affects the advantages of business of which he i a factor, to be relegated to the level of a mere appurtenance to a great machine, with little free will with no duty but that of passive obed ience, and with little hope or opportun Ity of rising In the scale of responsl ble and helpful citizenship. To the instinctive belief that such Is the inevitable trend of trusts and mo nopolles is due the wide-spread and deep-seated popular aversion In which they are held, and the not unreasona ble insistence that, whatever may be their Incidental economic advantages their general effect upon personal char acter, prospects and usefulness can not be otherwise than injurious. Though congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved Ineffectual, not because of any lack of disposition or attempt to en force them, but simply because the laws themselves as Interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the In sufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation It should be done. It should be recognized, however, that all federal legislation on this sub Ject may fall short of Its purpose be cause of Inherent obstacles, and also because of the complex character of our government system, which, while making the federal authority supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited that fear by metes and bounds which cannot be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this precise question renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of the trusts and monopolies can be adequately treated through federal action, unless they seek directly and purposely to Include In their objects transportation or Inter course between states, or between the United States and foreign countries. It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that may be applied. Kven though It may be found that federal authority Is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the power of the several states to act effectively In the premises, and there should be no rea son to doubt their willingness to Judlc lously exercise such power. KFFKItS TO VARIOUS SCIMECT3 Some Remark on 1'entioiis, the Navy Fort Ificat Ions, l'tc. The diminution of our enormous pen sion roll and the decrease of pension ex penditure which have been so often confidently foretold, still fall In ma terial realization. The number of pen sloners on the rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This Is the largest number ever reported. The amount paid exclusive ly for the pensions during the year was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease from that of the preceding year, while the total expenditures on account of pen sions. including the cost of maintain ing the department and expenses at tending pension distribution amounted to $142,206,550.59, or within a very small fraction of one-third of the entire ex pense of supporting the government during the same year. The number of new pension certificates issued was 90, 640. Of these, 40.374 represent original allowances of claims and 15,878 increase of existing pensions. The number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but residing in foreign countries at the close of the last fiscal year was 3.781, and the amount paid to them during the year was $582, 35.38. The sum ap proprlated for the payment of pensions for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, Is $140,000,000. and for the sue ceedlng year It Is estimated that the same amount will be necessary. The commissioner of pensions reports that during the last fiscal year 3'!9 indict menW were found against violators of the pension laws. Upon these Indict ments 157 convictions resulted. In my opinion based upon such state ments as these and much other Infor mation and observation, the abuses which have been allowed to creep Into our pension system have done Incalcu lable harm In demoralizing our people and rendering good citizenship. have endeavored within my sphere of official duty to protect our pension roll and make It what it should be, a roll of honor, containing the names of those disabled in their country s service and worthy of their country's affectionate remembrance. When I have seen those who pose as the soldiers' friends active and alert in urging greater laxity and more reck less pension expenditure, while nursing selfish schemes, I have deprecated the approach of a situation when necess ary retrenchment and enforced econ omy may lead to an attack upon pen sion abuses, so determined as to over look the discrimination due to those who, worthy of a nation's care, ought to live and die under the protection of a nation's gratitude. The secretary calls attention to the, public Interests Involved In an adjustment of the obli gations of the Pacific railroads to the government. I deem ; It to be an. Im portant duty to especially present this subject to the consideration of the con gress, i . The organlzd militia numbers 112.879 men. The appropriations for Its sup port by the several states approximate $2,600,000 annually and $400,000 is con tributed by the federal government. Investigation shows these troops to be usually drilled and inspired with much military Interest, but In many In stances they are so deficient In proper arms and equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them Inade quately prepared for field service. ' I therefore recommend that prmopt measures be taken to remedy this con dition and that every encouragement be given to this deserving body of un paid and voluntary citizen soldiers, upon wohse assistance we must largely rely In time of trouble. During the past year rapid progress has been made to ward the comple tion of the scheme adopted for the erection and armament of fortifications along our seacoast, while equal prog ress has been made In providing the material for submarine defense in con nection with these works. The experience and results of the past year demonstrates that with a continuation of present careful methods the cost of the remaining work will be much less than the original estimate. The construction of vessels for our new navy has? been energetically pros ecuted by the present administration upon the general lines previously adoptd. the department having seen no necessity for radical changes In prior methods under which the work was found to bo progressing In a manner highly satisfactory. It has been de cided, however, to provide In every ship building contract, that the builder should pay all trial expenses and It has also been determined to pay no speed premiums In the future contracts. Klght new unarmored cruisers and two new gunboats have also been commis sioned. The Iowa, another battleship, Will te cetnleted about March 1. and at least four more gunboats will be ready for eea In the early spring. It la gratifying to state that our ships and their outfits are believed to be equal to the best that can be manu factured elsewhere; and that such not thelr cost, at to Justify the statement that quite a number of vessels are now being; constructed at rates as low as those that prevail In European ship yards. It is most gratifying to noe the sat isfactory results that have followed the Inauguration of the new system provid ed, for the act of May 28. 1893. under which certain federal officials are com pensated by salaries Instead of fees. The new plan was put in operation on the 1st day of July. 1896.-and already the great economy it enforces, Its pre vention of abuses, s,nd its tendency to a better enforcement of the laws, are strikingly apparent. Detailed evidence of the usefulness of this long-delayed but now happily accomplished reform will be found clearly set forth In the attorney general's report. Our postofflce department Is In good condition, and the exhibit made of Its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30,1896, if allowance is made for imperfections In the laws applicable to It Is very satisfactory. The total re ceipts during the year were $82,499,208. 40. The total expenditures were $90. "26,296.84, exclusive of $1,559,898.27, which was earned by the Pacific railroad for transportation and credited on .their debt to the government. There was an Increase of receipts over the previous year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent, and an. increase of expenditures of $3,836, 124.02. or 4.42 per cent. The number of emigrants arriving in the United States during the fiscal year was 343,267, of whom 340,468 were permitted to land, and 2.799 were de barred on various grounds prescribed by law and returned to the countries whence they came at the expense of the steamship company by which they were brought In. The increase In Im migration over the preceding year amounted to 84.131. It Is reported that with some exceptions the immigrants of the past year were of a hardy la boring class, accustomed and able to earn a suppoi for themselves, and it is estimated that the money brought with them amounted to at least $5,000,000. Though It was probably much In ex cess of that sum since only those hav ing less than $30 are required to dis close the exact amount and it is known that many brought considerable sums of money to buy land and build homes. Including al the immigrants arriving who were over 14 years of age, 28.63 per cent. wer? Illiterate as against 20.37 per cent, of those of that age arriving during the preceding fiscal year. There arrived from Japan during the year only 1,110 immigrants, and it is the opinion of the immigration authorities that the apprehension heretofore ex isting to some extent of a large immi gration from Japan to the United States is without any substantial foun dation. In concluding this communication its last words shall be an appeal to the congress for the most rigid economy In the expenditure of the money it holds in trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagance Is easy, but a return to frugality is difficult. When, however, it is considered that those who bear the burdens of taxation have no guarantee of honest care save in the fidelity of their public servants, the duty of all possible retrenchment Is plainly manifest. When our differences are forgotten and our contests of political opinion are no longer remembered, nothing in the retrospect of our public service will be as fortunate and comforting as the rec ollection of official duty well performed, and the memory of a constant devotion to the Interests of our confiding fellow countrymen. 

OROVER CLEVELAND. Executive Mansion. Dec. 7, 1896. ON TIIK KVK OF THE SF.SSION. Influx of Statesmen at the Hotels Mark Raima the Central Figure. That Sunday was the eve of a new session of congress was apparent in the Washington hotels, which are always barometers of political activity under the dome. Senators and members com ing to the city by every train, rein forced by the attaches and lookers-on of congress, were drifting Into the lob bies, greeting one another like school boys after a vacation with much hand shaking, with reminiscences of the campaign and many explanations of how their re-elections or defeats had been brought about. There was com paratively small Interest in the work of the coming congress itself apart from the president's message, but clouds of speculation were afloat dealing with the policies of the new administration to be inaugurated on the 4th of March, and with the personnel of the cabinet. It was unanimously conceded that the Republican programme' was to ig nore the Dlngley tariff bill and to sum mon an extra session of congress for the 15th of March, for the purpose of passing a new tariff measure. Curios ity was expressed over what reference if any President Cleveland might make to the Issues and the result of the pres idential campaign, and particularly as to his policy upon the Cuban question. The central figure of the night was Marcus A. Ilanna, who is looked upon here as the advance agent of the Mc Klnley administration,' with a commis sion to feel the pulse of congress and to communicate the policy of the president-elect to the leaders. When Ilan na appeared. In the Arlington lobby after his dinner,, accompanied by II. C. Payne, of Wisconsin, who is slated as a cabinet probability; C. J. Dawes. of Chicago, a member of the Republi can committee, and General .Horace Porter, the marshal of the inauguration parade, the party was surrounded by congressmen and other politicians who' escorted them to Hanna's rooms.': The Republican chairman had been invisi ble during the day, trying to put aside politics for a Sunday, he explained, but throughout the evening he was. beset by visitors. Some of the most conspicuous men about the hotel, most of whom talked with Ilanna during the evening, were Senators Piatt, of Connecticut, and Aldrlch, of Rhode Island: Chairman Babcock and Vice Chairman Mercer, of the congressional campaign com mittee; General Grosvenor, of Ohio; Congressmen Lacey (of Iowa), Glllett. McCormack and Wilson (of New York), Foss, nelknap and Lorimer (of Illinois): Chairman Cannon, of the committee of Appropriations of the house, and"Dea con" S. V.
